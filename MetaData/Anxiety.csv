things we are trying to do all the time:

* be safe

things we can’t help but do all the time:

* second-guess ourselves
* behave impulsively and reactively
* take everything personally
* worry
* have difficulty accepting compliments
* have difficulty reciprocating friendly gestures
* worry
* have difficulty finding the courage to respond
* have difficulty not being suspicious of others’ intentions
* worry
* make a huge deal out of the smallest thing
* think we're bothering you

things you should keep in mind:

* we’re scared of everything
* pretty much all of the time
* it’s an actual disorder
* it manifests as impulsive behavior
* you can’t fix us with words
* telling us “worrying is silly” won’t make us stop worrying
* it’ll only make us feel silly
* and then we’ll worry even more
* “oh god
* like that
* also
* cold
* we constructed this armor as children
* we’re fairly certain you will never be able to pry it apart
* but there is a nice person under there

things you can do for a friend with an anxiety disorder:

* stick around
* ask them if they’re comfortable in a place or situation
* be willing to change the place or situation if not
* activities that help them take their mind off of things are good!
* talk to them even when they might not talk back
(they’re probably too afraid to say the wrong thing)
* try not to take their reactions (or lack thereof) personally
(the way they expresses themself is distorted and bent because of their constant fear)
(and they know this)
* give them time to respond to you
* they will obsess over how they are being interpreted
* they will anticipate being judged
* it took me four hours just to type this much
* even though i sound casual
* that’s because i have an anxiety disorder

things you shouldn’t do:

* tell us not to worry
* tell us we’ll be fine
* mistake praise for comfort
* ask us if we are “getting help”
* force us to be social
* force us to do things that trigger us
* “face your fears” doesn’t always work
* because—remember—scared of everything
* in fact

emergency action procedure for panic attacks:

* be calm
* be patient
* don’t be condescending
* remind us that we’re not “crazy”
* sit with us
* ask us to tighten and relax our muscles one by one
* remind us that we are breathing
* engage us in a discussion (if we can talk
* if we are having trouble breathing
* (it will be harder for us to exhale than inhale)
* (sometimes all it takes is our body to realize it can push the air back out)
* or breathe through our nose
* or have us put our hands on our stomach to feel each breath
* or have us put a hand on your chest and breath with you
* ask us what needs to change in our environment in order for us to feel safe
* help us change it
* usually

if you have an anxiety disorder:

* it’s okay.
* even if you worry that it’s not okay.
* it’s still okay. it’s okay to be scared. it’s okay to be scared of being scared.
* you are not crazy. you are not a freak.
* I know there’s a person under all that armor.
* and i know you feel isolated because of it.
* I won’t make you take it off.
* but know that you are not alone.

I am not necessarily shy, with some people, it works right away.

I know that what I'm afraid of isn't real. I know that the threat is an illusion and that I'm not really going to get hurt

I am working really hard to combat my anxiety disorder. Some days I start to give up because I've been fighting for so long and it doesn't seem to change, I am.

I am constantly exhausted. If your body went through intense terror each day (or sometimes, like walking into a store, running errands, sometimes even leaving my house.

Some of my behavior might seem pretty odd at times. I might make someone go with me to places I ought to be able to go to alone because I need a ""safe"" person there. I might come off as clingy and dependent on others, and that can make the difference between fleeing a place or being able to stick it out. We develop triggers in specific places and that place, as innocuous as it might seem to you, scares me to death. I don't want to feel that way; it's embarrassing, but I do. How would you feel if you were terrified out of your mind in a place or around a person you know is harmless in your heart?

I try many things to combat my anxiety. If you've heard about a technique, acupuncture, keeping active, positive self-talk, cognitive behavioral therapy, regular therapy, and medication, since the two are linked- you'd be depressed if you had an anxiety disorder) often get treated with strong medication, some meds make me extra tired or dizzy or any number of other things that aren't my normal or desired state. Most medication used to treat anxiety is something the body becomes immune to over time

Please don't make fun of me when I am experiencing a panic attack- it's horrible enough without you ridiculing me. You wouldn't be laughing if you were the one whose body was revolting in fear. I'm not making anything up, and to humor me and just tell me it isn't real and I don't have to be scared, even if it's the millionth time you've said it. Tell me you'll protect me and I might just believe you, because I want to so badly. I want to be tough and independent and in control, but something (psychological and chemical) inside of me won't let me be free.

Panic disorders are almost always genetic and are chemically related, or that something terrible is about to happen to us, etc. It's impossible to understand when it first happens, unless someone is there to warn you. There usually isn't.

Many of us live in terror of letting other people know we're freaking out, and calm, our insides are often a different story. It's ok to tell us we seem stabler or more confident- we'll appreciate you noticing. Just know that sometimes it might be an illusion, sometimes true one day but not the next. Acting like it's a result of something we didn't do is a double-blow, the first one being our own senses of failure for not being able to just ""tough it out"", ""grin and bear it"" etc.

Sometimes, give us the credit for living with something so tough and managing to do anything. Please, just support us and help us, and listen to us. It's natural to get annoyed sometimes, but if you're annoyed, we're probably beating ourselves up because we're a self-critical lot. That's part of how we got this way, by being too self-aware.

I am male and have the background probably most of you have
1) Super anxious mother, pacifying my anxiety.
2) Terrified of talking to girls
3) Might as well have gotten my doctorate for all the research I did into anxiety and all the rumination I expended on. For long stretches
4) Enormously self-critical of my performance and my anxiety and my thinking
5) Fundamentally unhappy even though I came to develop compensatory behaviors which fooled a lot of people into thinking I was confident.

I'm not going to spend anymore time discussing the ways I suffered over the years for brevity's sake. If you are interested

Now on to how I overcame anxiety

As I said above, I came across a book named Search Inside Yourself by Chade Meng Tan. It introduced me to mindfulness from a neuroscientific/practical benefit perspective. For someone with a hyper critical mind, I think its emphasis really suited my need for specific outcomes and efficacy data.

And so I began to meditate. Being brash, the world looked more garish, more vibrant. I was sold. 

Over the next couple of months I would continue these hour-long sits in which I would spend 80-90% of the time running the mental treadmill over these thoughts ""I don't know if I'm doing this right. This doesn't feel right. I think if I pay attention to the vibration of the breath in my nostrils I'll be able to stay mindful for longer. No.. that didn't work. Dammit! Why isn't this working?"" Sitting turned into a deeply unhappy, than actually, you know, meditating. 

I can't even say that I was being diligent in the frequency of my meditation. Over the last year, in retrospect, it did provide a diversion from my usual, *consuming*, habit of ruminating all day everyday about my anxiety.

During driving, or my two academic suspensions from an Ivy League school (simply could not function due to performance anxiety), or that I was a virgin who had never had a girlfriend.

But something was happening. In an ineffable sense, I would hold eye contact (even with girls!), smile, and even say hi to strangers. Now, full disclosure, a lot of these developments occurred because there were times when I wouldn't feel anxiety. Times, for instance, I behaved healthily. 

But. Nine months in, have often called me out for being closed off), conversing with my mum (especially about anxiety triggering topics), approaching girls - all of those still triggered the physical symptoms of anxiety and avoidance. I was convinced that the key to beating my anxiety was abating the overwhelming physical symptoms of anxiety which trigger avoidance. I was wrong.

To cut a long story short, compensatory habits I had developed for my anxiety in the past and my ensuing deep guilt and soul searching, and the third was a meditation retreat I attended.

Today, I have this intuitive sense that *I have a choice* about whether to cultivate the anxiety or let it go, and I have this intuitive sense of how exactly to let it go.

Think of it like playing basketball. You shoot the ball and it goes into the basket, what arc to give the ball. Now think of what happens when a beginner plays in a basketball game when someone applies defensive pressure to them. Their brain gets scrambled because of their anxiety and they lose the ability make use of that intuitive sense. But look at a professional player. He is not oblivious to the defensive pressure. It still affects him. But he is still able to recover from the momentary mental confusion and tap back into his intuitive sense of how to direct the ball into the hoop, even though he could never tell you how he's able to do it. 

That's how it is with anxiety and me. It arises like a bubble and I experience it and something tells me that I don't have to continue paying attention to it in a certain way (what 'in a certain way' means, over and over again. SOMEHOW, I'm not sucked into the anxiety. I can't explain it. But it's not voluntary - AT ALL. It just sort of happens in the way the basketball player intuitively knows to fluidly change his pace and his direction at full speed to elude defensive pressure. I could never fully explain it. And that's the thing - I simultaneously have a clear intuitive understanding that if I try to consciously mess with these responses, my anxiety will only inflame and increase. I subconsciously understand exactly how much to get involved and how much to leave alone. I subconsciously understand that attending to the physical emotions of anxiety and mental confusion does something bad to my quality of attention and thinking. How all this came from simply paying attention to the physical sensations of my breath and body, I have no idea - but I really didn't do anything more special than that over the past year.

So looking back, I'm not even sure I could have helped any of the efforts. The more I meditate, the more I see that it's a very questionable proposition to attribute any of my volitions or emotions - healthy or not - to my doing. In fact, more and more of my creativity and my performance comes from understanding how my drive to manage and exert control and intellectually master/understand only interferes with beautiful processes which are working themselves out. But if you had told me this a year ago today when I found Search Inside Yourself, I'm not sure it would have made a difference even if I had completely believed you. The brain does its own thing. :)

Ask away! I've omitted and truncated here and there because I realized this was turning into a tl'dr :)

For almost all of my life, I just could not face sleeping in my room alone. I hardly ever had any friends over (Back when I actually had friends) for the night, because I knew that if I ended up in my mom's bed, there would be a lot of questions. 

Even when my sister had friends over

Because of the small bed size

Occasionally, I tell myself that I want to sleep on my own. I get so close, until the night comes. Every time, I found that I couldn't do it. Something would come up, or something would scare me into crawling back to my mom's room. 

There were times when I was younger, I would lay awake in my bed until I was sure that he was asleep, so that I could creep silently in next to my mom. He often slept on the floor in the living room. 

Finally, and set in to play some of my favorite songs on a low volume. 

As lights in the house went out

I clicked off the light and padded back to my bed, my alarm was going off on my iPod. It was morning! I had finally, after so many years, slept in my bed through the night. I even turned off the alarm and slept for another hour! 

Tonight will be my second attempt

TL;DR: After 17 years of embarrassment and ridicule

I've always been bad with procrastination, which I haven't done, but I just sit in front of the computer or books I'm meant to be reading, and not doing it. Every time I put my head to starting, I'll work for about two minutes, until I get worried about actually going through with the work. 


Somewhere I know I can do it, I can literally get it done in about 3 hours of just working. But it takes seemingly days of sitting doing absolutely nothing, not getting spurred into working.


I can't think because I'm worrying about how I can't just get it done. Then I worry that I'll do it, and I want to do well, but being nervous about my work really doesn't help and means I end up rushing everything.

I've had anxiety since I was 17 (I'm 25 now), then came back after smoking some weed in Feb.

I read a book called ""At Last A Life"" which I can honestly say has helped me understand anxiety a whole lot better than ever before.

Here are some of the crowning bits of knowledge I've learned.

1. You are NOT going mad, we are so sensitive that we get worried or upset about these thoughts. It's this reaction to the thought that cause anxiety, not the thought itself, so (as hard as this can be to do), just ignore the thought. If you think of something awful happening, just say ""yeah, grand. This is just an anxious thought. Whatever"".

2. Anxiety can't be gotten rid of like a flu
One of the best things I've learned is that I will always have anxiety, I am reducing my anxiety about having anxiety. 

3. Deep breaths. You can't panic and relax at the same time. You can control your breathing which in turn controls your heart rate. When you get that sinking feeling of anxiety, I am okay"". This will give your mind a positive message to focus on while you slow your breathing and relax.

4. Stop trying to figure out how to control or stop anxiety. You continue to give it more power which increases its hold on you. Accept it.

5. Remember that an anxiety attack is a release of adrenaline into the body. Your mind believes there is a threat so it releases adrenaline into your system to help your caveman body deal with it. This was great when the threat was a cheetah but not so great when the threat is a thought you can't run away from. But understanding what the panic attack is allows you to relax slightly. 
So when a panic attack starts, nothing can happen to you. The adrenaline will stop soon and you will feel better.

6. Apparently 1 in 10 people in America have anxiety. You are not alone and you are not as isolated as you feel. You are one of many who feel this way so don't feel like you are all alone and the only one who feels like this. You are perfectly normal and this is going to get better over time. As you learn to deal with it

7. But the book I mentioned above. It goes into great detail and is written by a guy who dealt with anxiety for 10 years before he learned how to deal with it. 

I wish you well guys. Remember that people with anxiety tend to be very nice people who get upset because of their thoughts. That just shows what a lovely bunch we are. Those horrible thoughts of you doing something bad, worries about the world, economy, exams, etc, etc are only just thoughts. One you learn how to control your reaction to them, you will learn how to control your anxiety. Hope this has helped!

Now, so what gives you the right to tell someone to 'get over it'? No. Not okay, and it will never be okay. I struggle with chronic GAD, and have been for a few years, and  none of them know the true extent of how much my anxiety has crippled my ability to preform in school. Its changed my personality, and has recently drawn me away from social situations. There isn't an immediate solution to 'fixing' a disorder that consumes you so fully.

It felt like the world was ending. I thought I was going completely insane and considered dropping out of my grad school program and getting inpatient psychiatric treatment. But that didn't happen. Instead

1. **Therapy.** It was awkward and stressful and terrifying at first. Trust me, but when you are ready to put in the effort to be vulnerable and better understand yourself, it can be a transformative experience. I went once a week for 6 months, then twice a week for 3 months, and will continue once a week for however long I need to.

2. **Acupuncture.** I know it might sound fancy or expensive, which is MORE than worth it if you have disabling anxiety. Plus you get to stay as long as you want. It helped me so much, especially at the beginning when my body was in a constant state of hyperarousal and tension; acupuncture was the only thing that could seriously relax me. [Check to see if you have a community acupuncture clinic close to you.](https://www.pocacoop.com/clinics/) I went twice a week for a month, then once a week for two months, now whenever I feel particularly stressed or feel like I want to indulge in deep relaxation.

3. **Finding something spiritual to ground me.** I'm not going to go into my beliefs, because I had more perspective on my existence as a whole. I don't care if it's yoga, stargazing, Buddha, Allah, Jesus Christ, mindfulness, or bird watching

4. **Being patient with myself.** I never expected myself to get better quickly. It has been 9 months of busting my ass to get to where I am. I've had to allow myself to just accept wherever I am in the process

5. **Taking care of myself physically.** I eat whole, practicing yoga) definitely relieves some anxiety too, but I think it's most effective when done in tandem with other treatments (evidence suggests this, too).

6. **Watching these videos from the [Mindweather101: Navigating Mental and Emotional Distress](http://www.alloflife.org/Our-Classes/) ""class"".** The course is just a series of videos that you can watch whenever you feel like it (and it's free). One of the main ideas is that our brains are always changing. Thus even those of us diagnosed with a ""mental illness"" have brains with the capacity to change. Unfortunately, but they tend to talk more about severe depression, bipolar disorder, and schizophrenia).

I know that everyone's experience with anxiety is different, but I survived without and with a lot of hard work I no longer have that need. I am not saying this intending to make people feel bad for using medications, but I want people to know that *you CAN recover to a point that you no longer need meds*. Getting on meds does not mean you have to depend on them forever. No single treatment could have led me to where I am now, but with therapy, acupuncture, healthy spiritual and physical practices, that Mindweather course, I am panic attack free and have hardly any social anxiety.

What I believe to be special about this anxiety group is that we created an “anxiety bio”. The bio will allow you to talk to someone who actually can RELATE to you because they have the similar fears and triggers. Remember, social interaction, etc. It is all legitimate and never stupid or silly. 

Even if you do not feel comfortable being contacted

You have the option to be anonymous. You may just use your Reddit username as your contact info


Your information will be stored as a DropBox document. The only people who have access to this list


The more people involved the better
If you would like to be part of the group

1. Name you would like to go by.
2. Geographic location.
3. How you would like to be contacted. Note if you do not want to be contacted by anyone. 
4. Anxiety bio. (just a little info about yourself and your anxiety)

1345432940.0,yi6pa,"Hey, anxious Redditors.  The key to ALL successful therapy modalities, and the literal cure for many anxiety disorders, is this...  ",dweckl,19

You are a liar.  Did you know that?  There is a part of your brain that is a compulsive, unstoppable liar.  Every day, from the moment you wake until you pass out with your heart racing and feet rubbing together, a voice in your head is lying to you.  

And the worst part about is that every day

Long ago humans evolved the ability to think on an incredible level.  But this new brain did not replace the old one; instead, of the primitive functions that even simple animals have.  You eat, shit, fuck, and fear not much unlike a goddamn squirrel.  

You have inside your brain a primitive emotional system designed to provide short-term motivation to do things necessary to keep you alive or to reproduce.  Fear exists because it helps keep life living: something that's afraid will drop everything and run the fuck away, as a general principle. 

The problem with you and me is that our primitive emotional system is entangled with our advanced upper-brain.  It's not just the angry bear standing in front of you that causes anxiety

Let me repeat that last point:  your thoughts can cause you anxiety to the same degree as if you were actually experiencing a dangerous event.  People who have panic attacks know this all too well - there could be literally nothing dangerous in front of them in the real world

I think most people have a thought-system that creates and fires off negative thoughts by the dozens each day.  Some people aren't really aware of their negative thoughts until they really focus on them, really fast and can be going on behind the scenes without the type of focus you usually picture when you think about your ""thoughts.""  These aren't thoughts like the thoughts you have when you're trying to solve a math problem.  These are thoughts like fireworks popping off at any moment in your mind, almost from nowhere, but sometimes so feint you can only react to it without being aware that it even happened. 

What happened beginning in the 1950s with Albert Ellis and Aaron Beck is a new approach to therapy for people with anxiety disorders.  It's goal is to defeat your reaction to the negative thoughts that act like little angry bears in your mind - you learn that the thoughts are just thoughts, as does anyone who breathes, but it doesn't even come close to the shit I suffered for 10-15 years before finding a great CBT therapist and reading about it. 

Similarly, your thoughts.  Yes, this can be done.  The way I think of it is like this:  imagine you are standing in front of a girl naked, and she is laughing and making fun of you.  And this goes on for hours.  How long until you just don't give a fuck any more?  How long until you realize that her laughter doesn't mean shit to you?  

How long until you realize that the voice in your head telling you that you will fail, or that a girl will reject you, or that you're going to get fired, or that you're going to have a panic attack outside and then the whole world will laugh at you, or that you just can't meet your boss' expectations, etc., are just words.  Worthless, stupid words. 

The next time you're anxious about something, and not the world out there, that makes you anxious.  

The cure for anxiety is to cure the way you react to your thoughts.  

**EDIT 1**:   Reading some of the comments saddens me.  This forum is rife with recommendations and discussions of medications and anecdotal stories about what people have said about what people think is happening to them when they have anxiety.  Very, links to scientific reports and research, and discussions of therapists.  The reason people don't get better is because what they think is wrong.  Dead wrong.  Stop listening to me and others and GO READ THE GODDAMN RESEARCH.  

People who think that the modality is not as important a good therapist of some ineffective modality are dead wrong

People who think that anxiety just happens out of the blue are dead wrong, then you aren't aware of them.  Dealing with the thoughts does not mean stopping them, shutting them off, or stifling them, it means understanding them and their relationship to actual reality.

1351272120.0,124scq,"A recent agoraphobia thread has shown me there's a lot of mystery and misconceptions regarding agoraphobia.  Instead of hijacking that poster's thread, here's a description of what agoraphobia is, from someone housebound for 5.5 years.",panicmonkey,90,38

5.5 years housebound.  7.5 years with agoraphobia.  Wait

From the DSM-IV:
http://www.medicalcriteria.com/site/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47%3Apsyagoraphobia&amp;catid=76%3Apsychiatry&amp;Itemid=80&amp;lang=en

1.  Agoraphobia isn't ""fear of open places"", you can't just have one, it usually spreads to other places or situations.

2.  Agoraphobics aren't always housebound.  Much of the time they are.  Before I became housebound

3.  Many agoraphobics have a ""comfort radius"".  I can drive or walk about a half mile from home.  On good days

4.  Not all agoraphobics have panic disorder.  There is a distinct diagnosis in the DSM-IV for agoraphobics without panic disorder.

5.  Sometimes other conditions are mistaken to be agoraphobia.  Social phobia is one - it has its own diagnostic criteria.  The results are the same, I could have gotten off that one street if it was social phobia most likely.

6.  Probably the most important thing about being agoraphobic is that agoraphobic patients wind up not fearing the thing that made them agoraphobic.  They fear the resulting panic attack.  For instance

7.  People with agoraphobia are liars.  This is extremely difficult, but making excuses for not going and doing things has made me a liar.  In more recent years, I've decided to just tell people what I have.  It makes me feel better to maintain my integrity.  But the point still stands.  We make excuses better than most anyone you know.  And can generally manipulate any person or situation to gain equilibrium.

8.  Agoraphobia is extremely isolating.  That isolation leads to rumination, severe depression.  It's hard to be alone for so much o the day.  And it's humiliating to ask someone to do something for you that you should be able to do yourself.  It may sound like a lot of fun to be able to stay home and work, mess around, watch TV or whatever.  But the truth is, most of us are spending a lot of time thinking about what our lives have become and how we can make it better.  And that takes the fun out of lots of stuff.

I'm a recent college graduate, my current job sucks the devil’s ball sack. Second, I’m generally very insecure about my place in the working world. 

Let’s start with the first problem. My employers are incredibly finicky and tend to make the smallest issues into huge catastrophes. For example, lots of finger-pointing and ""how did this fall through the cracks? This should be standard procedure!"" type emails. Now every time I get an email, I'm filled with a sense of dread that it's one of my employers, getting on to me about something I screwed up. If they turn such a stupid thing into such a huge deal, I'm terrified of what will happen if I do something seriously wrong (and I already have screwed up several times). A lot of the people in my office tend to be very rude and unsympathetic as well. My boss is a living stereotype: a very materialistic, sharp-tempered, merciless, I’m terrified of her. She sees me as a bumbling idiot (perhaps justifiably), so I don’t intend to stay with this job too long. However, so maybe this is how I have to pay my dues to enter the working world. 

But in general, and rarely ever had these feelings of doubt, but now it’s a totally different ball game. I’m stuck in a rut where I feel guilty that I’m not contributing anything valuable, so I try to overcompensate by being extremely cautious and meticulous, which stresses me out and makes me more prone to screwing up. I’ve seen my coworkers make mistakes and bounce back, completely unshaken. How do they do that?? Whenever I make a mistake a want to curl up in a ball and cry about my incompetence. I’ve been working there about a month, and there’s still so much I don’t know. I can’t imagine how people go to work confident each day, and I’d love to hear how other people with anxiety deal with stressful work situations. Thanks for your help!

The first he burst from a cafe into the suit and scans for physical problems which none are found. 

The second when a kid asks about the trauma from the avengers film and he needs to escape.

The third while driving.

Now first of I have to say this brilliant. Why?? Because it really shows an understanding of what anxiety is. The fact that the character is suffering from this after as serious life changing event is something that does happen in real life. 

While we have not strapped on a super suit and battled aliens

I guess what I m trying to say is that I am delighted that 
1: Anxiety/Panic is shown to millions as something through cinema
2: It is portrayed very well in terms that it happens multiple times and not something our hero ""just mans up too""

A lot of people reading this probably have more severe anxiety

- I feared social interaction. I remember my heart used to race just from talking in online games let alone real life.

- I feared being around people. I couldn't cough in crowded rooms, so sometimes I would get stuck.

- Never danced or sung in my life or even tried. Stays completely still during rock concerts.

- Failed almost every oral presentation due to not doing it.

- No sports

- Finally, family asks you to move out etc.

I overcame most of these by joining a martial art, knowing I had the full support of my peers and many hours of training, I knew I could do it and I did!

Fast forward 12 months and I have so much more confidence in myself. My posture is better, I'm better at talking to people, I stopped playing video games and watching TV, I went on a few dates (which again where a huge challenge).

I'm still about 100 000 miles from where I want to be

A few years ago I started having some problems with anxiety.  Things have improved slowly but steadily until now

Here's something which has helped in my recovery.

I have found that it's useful to distinguish physical sensation from my emotional state.  The best example I've come up with is the feeling you get when you drink coffee.

Originally when all of this started, a fluttering in my stomach, enhanced mental acuity, and a slightly modified mental perception of what's going on.

These physical sensations are very similar to those I feel when I am in an anxious state of mind, when I drink coffee and feel these things I simply make myself mindful that these physical sensations DO NOT require an emotional response.  They're simply caused by the effect of a drug on my body, and the drugs effect of increased synaptic activity in my thinkputty.

Immediately

Every cup of coffee is a therapy session

I started with a quarter cup of coffee per day and slowly worked my way up.  Now I drink about a cup a day

Some reflections I wrote on my second adolescence. ,iced327,75,6,21,"Someone once dropped the phrase ""wrong side of 25"" in a conversation I was having about relationships and age gaps. Details of the discussion aside

I spent most of 2012 on neither side of 25 - rather right in the middle

I imagine I'm not the only person beginning to realize that adulthood isn't really a threshold you instantly cross once you get a degree and a job. That omniscient quality that our elders once seemed to possess was really nothing more than a facade, our coworkers, and the other relationships we foster in the “real world”. And one day we might seek to validate it by passing it on to someone else.

I spent the last year teetering on the edge of a second adolescence. Part of me kept holding on to my college years, “I liked you better when I thought you had it all figured out.” So did I.

It was equally as hard to find myself in reflections of my friends, or struggling just as much as me to find their place in a world that was as unprepared for them as they were for it. We’ve all been standing on our own two feet for some time now, but there’s rarely a hint of stability or uniformity in our gait. We can at least find comfort in knowing that we’re not alone in our confusion.

It’s hard to tell if next year I’ll find myself on the “right side of 25”. I made a lot of mistakes this year

I took a big step this morning in addressing uncertainties about myself that I’ve yet left unanswered, but those aren’t metrics by which I choose to judge myself.

I’m an adult because I’m told to be. I’m an adolescent because I feel like one. And I’m a child because I learn like one.

There is no single definition or identity to which I can relate. Our 20s are a journey and our personalities are malleable. Our experiences may be different

So you have anxiety

If you’re the unsure case, nervousness, or unease, typically about an imminent event or something with an uncertain outcome.

Now, Panic Disorder, Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) and Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. While it’s never good to self-diagnose, you can probably self-evaluate with a simple Google search to best learn what exactly is going on.

Anxiety is, the same thing that helps you avoid split-second car accidents, and gets your libido on. Some of our brains dump adrenaline at the most inopportune time; it’s too much of a good thing.

Once you know what’s going on

* Stimulation - what were you doing?
* Thought - what were you thinking?
* Emotion - what were your emotions?
* Body Sensation - heartbeat, shaky
* Joy level - 1 to 5
* Misery level - 1 to 5
* Action - how did you act upon when stimulation?
* Going into the situation
* Going into the situation
* Trigger - if any?
* What actions were helpful?
* What actions made the situation worse?

If you accumulate enough data

Then

* Avoid caffeine - it’s a stimulant
* Avoid stimulants - see above.
* Physical stimulus - do something, taking a walk, wrestling with your puppy. If your temperature goes up, your anxiety goes down.
* Have food in your stomach - you know how when you’re hungry
* If you’re medicated
* Sleep is vital. Don't get too much

Now, there isn’t really enough time to do that 10-step questionnaire (“hold on - feeling an onset of panic - gotta fill out this form!”). Why do we have social phobia? Well, it’s a natural thing. Some of us are just more natural than others. Common characteristics of social phobia is an extreme worry of scrutiny or judgement by others - most often by people around your age. That last bit is very key: by people around your age. For example, I’m great around parents, elders, and little kids, but if you bring someone +- 5 years of me

The best way to overcome such situations is desensitizing yourself. Think of it like playing the same song over and over and over (...) until you get sick of it. Well, you’ll become less sensitive to the situation. It sucks at first, and remember it only gets better after that. Each time you’ll become less and less sensitive.

If you’re having a panic attack in a relaxed, do some four-count breathing:

* In for four seconds.
* Hold for four seconds.
* Out for four seconds.
* Repeat for four minutes.

While there is heaps of information out there, or a good ‘ol Google Search will also suffice. ",,False,,t5_2qmij,1342736608.0,,

Just know this--these people have anxiety problems. Weed is good for some with social anxiety and the like

Anxiety, which raises your mind's awareness of a state that it's not used to (or, is out of its equilibrium). When you experience a panic attack, it's kind of like your mind leaves auto pilot and you are suddenly grabbing for the controls. You freak. Panic attacks are very energy depleting and traumatic for the mind. This causes negative thinking and fear, as well as fear of the physical change you feel, which causes more fear, negative thinking

Eventually, which will be tabbed as ""GAD"" by general doctors. I've been to so many different types of visits to assure myself. 

But, etc. I won that fight and spent three months feeling like $1 million. I felt AMAZING! FREE!! SOOOO DAMN HAPPY!!!

Now I'm fighting the same fight again thanks to a mistake with some weed...but it's the same fight. So

Acute GAD can be caused by one panic attack

But...there's a reason weed is being legalized

Not saying smoking can't trigger full on GAD...it can. But, can trigger this cycle of panic and anxiety disorder. Just know you are dealing with the same documented medical issue that so many of us have...and not same rare, unreversable problem that has doomed you.

I'm a great listener, I always struggle to come up with something to say.

I find it incredibly hard to make friends when I come off as aloof or disinterested, when I'm actually just unsure of what to say next.

I'm so envious of people that can shoot off funny one-liners and tell good stories. I feel like I have no good stories!

This ultimately convinces me that I'm just a boring person with nothing to offer the world and no passions. I let my shyness and uncertainty get in the way to trying new things and exploring possible passions. 

I guess I'm looking to connect with other folks who may feel this way or similarly. I have always wanted to be outgoing and have felt happiest in my life in the rare times I've been comfortable enough to be and had a lot to say. The other 99% of the time I'm shy

I felt uncomfortable with the idea of therapy for my anxiety for a long time.  I've been pretty functional most of my life, and that it was just a character flaw that I couldn't deal with stressful things.  But, that was what I've deemed ""anxiety brain"" was seeing.  In the real world, I was crying and panicking almost every morning that I had to go to my easy part time job.  Physically, I was having trouble sleeping, my shoulders always ached, my bowels were almost never happy


So, but the worry about having to take meds should not keep you from asking for help!  


I saw a therapist once a week for about 4 months, seeing a therapist really helped give me better tools to deal with it as it comes.  I still feel like I'm more anxious than the average person, but it doesn't bog me down like it used to.  So last I wanted to add some things that I feel like really helped me.

1. Therapy.  Literally

2. Keeping a regular sleep schedule.

3. Meditation

4. Keeping a journal.  Writing down my anxious thoughts helps get them out of my head.  And then

5. Finding things to look forward to.  I expended a ton of energy on negative things

6. I drink a lot of hot tea.  Sometimes specifically ""relaxing"" or ""anti-anxiety"" labeled teas.  But I honestly also just enjoy the process of making and drinking tea.  I have my own little teapot

7. Exercise.  Even just walking.  It always felt to me like I was burning up some sort of anxiety chemical along with the calories.

8. Podcasts.  I love podcasts.  [Mental Illness Happy Hour](http://mentalpod.com/) is a great one that specifically addresses mental illness, but the host Pete Holmes often talks about his experiences with therapy, and sometimes the guests do as well.  Just hearing people talk about it sort of normalized it for me, and made it seem less scary.  Plus Pete Holmes is hilarious, and laughing always makes me feel better!

That feels really long winded

EDIT: Just wanted to add one more thing.  After having a low paying part time job for a long time, and it was actually through networking and talking to people that I got the interview!  I'm hella nervous, but that just means I'll get some good meditation practice in and drink a lot of tea between now and then = )

As far back as kindergarten

My heart skipped a beat whenever the doorbell rang

I don't call anyone
The funny thing is

Anytime I get asked out or someone wants to befriend me, and my dog is the only thing that can really calm me down. It probably doesn't help that I'm scared of any and all medications. My boyfriend had me try marijuana for the first time last week. We smoked every day for the past week and a half, and I've found it doesn't help anything, it just makes me feel sick and my head hot. 

I've tried talking to my family, have their own lives and are unreceptive most of the time. My panic attacks are always quiet and I'm alone so much that no one ever sees them, so it never got brought up while I was living with them. My sister thinks I'm being dramatic and keeps telling me to just ""get over it"" and that I'm just asking for attention. I believed her for a long time. I figured I was just overreacting and that I need to get over it. 

Up until today

I recently got hired at a restaurant. I'm completely capable of waiting tables without freaking out too badly. I hide it well. I'll say something stupid, and walk away from a table with my cheeks burning and a death wish in my head, but I can control it on my face. When I get through a table without any triggers, I literally get emotional and have to hold back tears of joy. It's hard, but I thought I could handle another waitressing job. 

Yesterday, which is why this was strange. Every time I looked at my phone, I had a panic attack. Just the simple green box that said ""Server - 3:00"" set me off. As I get closer and closer to 3, I feel worse and worse. 

That's when I found r/anxiety. 

So now, because I had no idea that what I'm feeling isn't normal, and that I can potentially do something about it. 

I guess I just needed to get this off my chest. I'm still deciding if I can go to work today. I've got 2 hours. Right now, because I can't let this affect my life anymore. I think 22 years is enough.

I don't blame her for being upset. I feel like I've let down my boss, and most of all myself.

My husband and son took the train ride through the free roaming area.  My daughter is still a baby so an hour train ride with her would have been rough.  Usually this would have caused a PANIC.

1376171424.0,1k3znr,It get's better. Seriously.,aSlowDance,62,4,13,"EDIT: formatting and why the fuck did I put an apostrophe in gets -_-.

**Why I am writing this** I've been meaning to post here for awhile because I feel like as a 'survivor' of panic disorder and depression that I have, especially on the internet in public forums like these. Maybe it is a result of the stigma associated with mental disorders, I'm not sure.

Anyways, as a current sufferer, likely read a ton of stuff on here and other websites about how difficult of a time others are having. Many talk about how they have had to deal with panic disorder for their entire lives and have ""accepted"" the idea that they are going to live with this for the rest of their lives. There is often a giant sense of hopelessness; I know . I just want to quickly write out my story and let everyone know that there are in fact people out there who really do beat this and go on to find happiness and success in life.

**Background on my history with anxiety and panic:** I started suffering from panic attacks around age 15, MDMA, few other small things). Things got bad fast; I stopped going out and seeing my friends. Grades dropped big time. I began taking SSRIs and ativan. After trying a few, I found that Celexa worked. At age 17, after about 2 years on Celexa (40mg) I began to taper off because I wasn't experiencing any symptoms anymore. I thought it was just a phase I was going through. 

Sure enough, and also started trying out a slew of other SSRIs (tried Celexa again, wasn't working anymore). My panic disorder spawned into full depression and stuff got real bad. I nearly failed high school, I was barely eating, rarely left my room. Thoughts of killing myself crossed my mind at multiple times. I had no friends, couldn't keep up a job, was terrified to leave my bed and absolutely hated myself and life.

**Getting help** My doctor finally asked me if I would try seeing a psychologist. At this point in time, going in there and I immediately started talking about how horrible my day was and how crippling anxiety is. My psych interrupts after five minutes and says, ""Listen, your parents are paying quite a bit of money right now just to have you sit here and complain. Our time is limited and I did not spend a decade in University to have you sit here and complain. We have work to do."" It was a real eye opening moment.)

I guess the 'secret' to my success with anxiety, lots of writing, along with various other lifestyle improvements (exercise, some mindfulness meditation, etc.). I immediately started seeing improvements after a few weeks. It wasn't easy though: CBT is tough, real fucking tough. It was the most difficult thing I have ever had to go through, but trust me when I say this it works damn well. You just have to put in the work. After 8-10 months of regular visits I woke up one morning and realized I wasn't scared anymore. The anxiety and panic were gone. It was like how life was before except even better. I now had a much clearer understanding of my emotions

**Today** So

* The old me nearly failed high school and first year of university. Today
* Previously
* Before I had trouble walking down the street to check the mail. In February I flew to Spain by myself and vacationed for 10 days.
* I had a horrible time meeting girls and knew nothing about dating or sex. I've had multiple girlfriends these past view years from a variety of walks of life. While none of them lasted very long I am still having an absolute blast with dating and whatnot.
* I thought I would be taking SSRIs and ativan for the rest of my life. Today I sit here medication free for years now (not that there is anything wrong with medication
* I'm content. Life isn't always easy but as sufferers of anxiety and panic we know the difference between tribulations like the death of a friend

So, no genius IQ as a child or any of that shit. Just a normal kid who developed a crippling panic disorder. I just want everyone to know that they can beat this shit and accomplish things they never thought possible. If you would have asked me 6 years ago what my life would be like today, I would have answered ""likely would have killed myself by then"". CBT might not be for everyone, I'm not a doctor, but it worked for me. See a psychologist, they're doctors and have an incredible amount of knowledge that can help you. If things don't work out with one, keep trying until you find one you really connect with. I know this shit is expensive but it will be the best investment you have EVER made.

TL:DR: Got severe anxiety and panic when I was a teenager, you don't have to live the rest of your life like this.

I wish I had a place like this to go to while I had anxiety and depression
I just wanted to offer some practical tips and ideas for getting through the worst of anxiety

1. Talk to your doctor. 
You have a chemical imbalance that may or may not fix itself. There's no shame in considering medication. Taking medicine turned my life around

2. Talk with the ones you love. 
Even though it's hard at first, which made me feel way less alone.

3. Watch kids movies. :)
 It might sound funny but it helped me a lot. 

4. Be active enough that you want to go to bed at night.
For me, laying awake in bed because of anxiety, sleeping in, repeat. Even though it feels like the hardest thing in the world to do, go outside. Walk around, exercise, go to the store

5. Wake up everyday and choose to fight it.
This might not be for everyone, you know it's a battle. It's the hardest thing I've ever experienced. So rise above it, be brave, choose to live on in spite of it.

And when it is recognized as an illusion, it is now much easier to to slow it down and sweep it away. Talking about it here in hopes of helping others.    ",malaislinn,64,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/12d8k6/i_just_realized_that_the_endless_cycle_of/, but I now have figured out how to actually put in to practice. My symptoms were really that of Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My friend suggested that I tell him what the worries are as they occur to me

It helps me to articulate this and maybe even get feedback, in hopes of helping others as well. I posted this in r/Buddhism because it's related to an idea that fits with Buddhism but it is really also a cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy application.
I read the entire book ""Buddhism on the Couch, cements the importance of needing to find out a truth through direct experience, as opposed to reading it and assuming you have understood it.
It's like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders! (Another expression that I always hear

I want to mention another very important part of this discovery. It almost seems counter-intuitive, they are so automatic and you have the desire to cling to them so strongly.  They are just a habit you are accustomed to. 

I hadn't realized that the way I lived might be abnormal for the longest time, it was a part of me that I was used to and almost accepting of. When someone commented to me ""you seem nervous"" while I was talking to them at my job I replied back ""yeah, that's just me.""

But one of the key things is not being attached to the anxiety as a tied in part of who I am.

The other key thing is what I want to call the ""recursive worry"" or the ""self-referential"" worry. Which is to say, then it is much easier to let go of them. If you can forgive yourself for them when they occur, they lose their strength. In an internet metaphor, it's almost like you're ""feeding the troll"" when you criticize and punish yourself mentally for your own recurring thoughts. They will just grow more and take more persistence and practice to cut down.

The worries are weeds choking the tree that is your mind/body. And you can affect your bodily symptoms by changing what is in your mind

You cling to worry because it's what is comfortable to you. But this is where attachment comes in, it will just make everything worse.

But you have to know that you are capable of being centered, and be it. The brain is malleable and any pattern of anxiety is just a practiced habit. You can rewire the circuits your own brain by re-training it, but you need to have patience, love for yourself even when you fall back on the habits.

I'll give you an example of the conversation I was having with my friend. The things I most often worry about are pleasing other people and whether I am being judged by other people. I didn't realize how often thoughts like this occurred to me until I just really started paying attention to it. And even then over time I would criticize myself for always worrying. This is something small, Jeremy told him he would play in about an hour. After an hour Jeremy decided against it because he was preoccupied with talking to me and starting a painting he got an idea for. The worry that started in my head then was ""I hope Travis isn't really bored now because he doesn't get to go play online with his friend tonight, I hope I don't monopolize Jeremy's time and that he can still spend enough time with his friends."" But then that thought grew larger and I thought ""What if Travis had a bad day and was just hoping to come back and be able to relax by playing a game with his friend."" At the same time I tell myself this is probably all irrational and I shouldn't spend the next hour dwelling on it, but the snowball has gained momentum by then and it is like an obsession, slapping down any rational challenge. So I tell this to Jeremy and he goes what? No, I stopped thinking about the Travis thing within 5 minutes. We have plenty of time to play Borderlands.

So I started a thing with Jeremy where if the worry came in to my head and I noticed it and didn't just let it create a fake reality, and then I could let it go. I am going to bridge from this by teaching myself not to be afraid of or attached to any particular outcome. That way I am not setting myself up for anxiety. *Because if I am afraid of a particular outcome, that fear will color my perception of what actually happens.* I interpret an expression on someone's face or a tone of their voice in a way that confirms my made-up fear. It blinds me to what is actually happening.

One thing I am very good at is coming up with all of the possible judgments someone could have about what I am saying or what I doing, and not be attached to a particular one.  You can't completely control what does or does not happen.  But if you don't have any preconceived expectation of how you want things to happen, you will not set yourself up for anxiety.  If you aren't attached to a particular outcome, you will have no reason to worry or to attribute any diversion from the course to personal shortcomings.  You can't expect yourself to manage things in the way you exactly want to at all times.

I didn't realize the amount of things that my worrying affected. It affects my attention span, but you have to forgive yourself.  You can view each new worry and each new source of anxiety as an opportunity to better yourself.  You have to practice being mindful, and to sort of ""catch"" yourself in different worries.  It can be easy to miss them because you are so accustomed to your regular thought patterns.  

Anyway
Have a good night/day. :)

1351361218.0,126jge,Here's some of my thoughts on how to deal with anxiety. They may or may not help you.,,60,7,13,"*Quick back story:* 

I'm a 28 year-old guy and I started feeling really bad anxiety symptoms about 2 years ago. I would describe myself as queitly confident and the anxiety just hit me out of the blue and was probably due to a particular period in my life about 4 years ago where 4 people I knew/were related to, and was about to embark on a new career path.

*One thing I've learned:*

**Anxiety is horrible.** 

Absolutely horrible. And until you've experienced it, every day became an exhausting battle just to be able to do very seemingly normal things.

I think the crux of it (for me

It's like anxiety likes to try and latch on to anything it can to induce the fear response and the ocd thoughts.

I'm gonna write out some of what I've went through (and am still going through). It's crazy and sometimes very laughable (and embarassing!) but here it is:

* fear of wetting myself
* fear that I'll get an erection
* fear that I'll ejaculate
* fear that I'll faint
* fear that my hands will noticibly shake

The fear of getting an erection is a very laughable one. But c'est la vie

Personally this manifests in the desire to constantly check myself

""Am I getting an erection?""

""Is my penis sticking out?""

""Do I have a wet patch on the front of my shorts?""


People might be able to relate that these thoughts/feelings get worse when I'm in situations where I'm percieved to be trapped, when I'm taking my coaching class, when I'm in class, when I'm sitting in lectures.

Here are some of my thoughts:

""What if I wet myself right in front of these people?""

""What if I get an erection? Does this mean that I'm a pervert? Is that a twinge a feel? Oh, what the fuck is wrong with me?""

All of these situations that I fear have happened exactly ZERO times in my life. They have occured many

And that is why anxiety is a deeply irrational thing! But irrational or not

**So

* The very first thing is acceptance. Accept your body and accept your thoughts but - and this is extremely important - don't identify with them. Watch them almost like some sort of scientific experiment. Watch and accept.
* Make peace with the worst-case scenario in your head (this is obviously a very individual thing). Be ok with that worst case scenario:

""Ok, the sun will set, and tomorrow'll be a new day.""

When I consider that I'm on a floating rock surrounded by other members of my species and none of us know what the hell is going on

Now this is the difficult and scary step:

* Do everything you can to expose yourself to the fear. Really
* YOU ARE A WARRIOR! When things are going crazy inside your body simply sit and breath. Do nothing else but feel the feelings, and breath. Do not try to aviod them and totally avoid any little safety-ticks that you have.
* Anxiety is a tricky little devil. It'll throw in a new bodily sensations to try and make you think that this time it's real! This time you're really gonna wet yourself! But be steadfast; do not be the first to blink! Anxiety is ultimately the wizard behind the curtain. Expose it for what it is.

For me, and everytime I don't I weaken its grip on me.

And this is scary

**In conclusion:**

Anxiety is perfectly normal. Trying to get rid of it is a goal that is rooted in failure because you won't. Ever. 

What we *can* do is reduce it back to a normal level because, medication is a great way to get a handle on it, for others, it may be some sort of therapy. Our amygdala 'dial' may even revert back to a more normal level simply through time.

Our problem - and the reason we're different from other seemingly 'normal' people - is that we've become hypersensitive to our bodily sensations. Someone without an anxiety disorder has similar feelings but mostly they don't consciously register with them in the same way that they register with us.

Relax: the sensations are normal. Our body is a magnificent machine that takes care of an insane amount of tasks each and every second that we're alive. Try not to get too hung up or worried about a few twinges/tingles. Our body takes care of itself. You

I've been dealing with anxiety for just over 5 years now. Pretty much restricted to health anxiety and panic attacks about dying suddenly. It has been getting a lot better in the last couple years but every time I have a panic attack it feels like I'll never get better. But today showed me that not only is it possible

I had a tooth extracted today. I was very nervous about it, especially ones that have noticeable effects. And I knew I would need and be prescribed Tylenol 3s. Last time I took them (also dental I think) I had a massive panic attack and probably ended up at the emergency room feeling like an idiot as usual. [I live alone and everyone I love lives almost 5000km away so my panic attacks would generally end up in the ER since I have no one else to calm me down).

So this morning the extraction went way better than they expected. Took only a few minutes and didn't need to cut my gums or anything. I decided not to take a Clonazepam (I take as needed and very rarely now) and try to tough it out. It was tough

It's now almost 10 hours later and I have NOT had a panic attack. I have just been chilling on the couch all day

A big trigger for me is not feeling like myself which is why I stopped doing all drugs and am wary of new medication since I developed anxiety. This is the first time since that I've dealt with something like this as a normal person and not someone who thought she was going to be found in two weeks cold and dead on the floor. I definitely feel the effects of the tylenol 3s

I don't even know what to say really.

Since my dad died

I've had chances to go to college, there will be no college or career.

I had a 3.5 in high school and did well enough to get a scholarship to college. The June before my freshmen year

Since then

It's not just my education. I have horrible job experience dominated by ""no shows"" so I basically have no job experience or references at 24. The last job I had was at retail. I cried before work every morning because I hated it. I would cut myself and drink Jack Daniels before I went in. I'd park the car and open the bottle. 

Of course, and I never had before.

At this point

What's worse? I'm frozen. People tell me things to do

She's sweet, very nice and loving, but I feel like I haven't progressed much with her. And then while going to counseling I decided to go to a Psychiatric Center to try medication to calm my nerves since everything, and anything, makes me nervous. Not to mention I was feeling so numb. So I want, was diagnosed and given Prozac. It helped me out so much. I felt calm and even happy. But then after 3 months I became depressed every time I took my dose, which worked for me for the next 3 months but then it made me irritated

After those, but just saw I was harming myself. I even dropped my birth control and changed and no change occurred but my menstrual cycle regulating. Even been having a hard time losing weight.

It's been a month without medication.

And so, unable to know what I should be working on. I need help, and I want to learn how to get rid of this numb feeling. It's affected how I feel about everything, including my boyfriend. I know I love my boyfriend, but im so numb I don't feel the dread of going to work, no appetite for anything and eating gives no pleasure (I took advantage of this and i'm eating healthier), no pleasure in sex and no feeling of love towards my boyfriend.

Please, and I no longer want to live. 




I miss finding life pleasurable.

1. Make a phone call. Doesn't have to be long

2. Do a math equation in your head. If my wife notices that I am obviously having a panic attack, but this really helps. It takes just long enough for my brain to completely change gears.

3. Take a huge breath, you think about someone or something that really makes you angry. 

4. Diet and exercise. Caffeine has gotta go, or ride a bike up a huge hill. I always feel much better, and this can give a lasting 24 hours of relief. 

5. Acupuncture. This helps relax you

6. Meditation. Every morning I wake up and pee, and learn it. Its your best tool.

7. Stay away from Xanax. This is a temporary band-aid which over time will make it worse. Try some herbal remedies. 

8. Have a couple cocktails.  I find just 2-3 totally takes away the symptoms

9. Don' let your eyes wander around

10. If you feel you need to bail, and need to abort whatever I was doing, look at the time, and add 3 minutes. Say, I am going to abort if this doesn't get better in 3 minutes. Many times it will!

Good luck!

Edit: Here is a bonus tip: When you feel it coming on, instead of your brain. Then, when you know you have done that, write down what happened, what you did, and how it felt. Beating anxiety is way harder the quitting cigarettes or even cocaine. So, ring the whole army to the battle. But don't get lost in it.

I'm new to reddit and was actually inspired to join because I wanted to share something that has helped me.  I posted something similar on r/depression as I suffer from both anxiety and depression

I see so many posts about different medications (and I have been on sooo many over the last 10 years) and they've helped me tremendously.  I don't know where I'd be without them.  But I'd like to have a baby so I have been working on trying to either reduce or get off them over the last 6 months.  It's been a nightmare.  Some days I couldn't get out of bed.  My anxiety at work was so bad I couldn't concentrate so I had to keep going back up to my regular dosage.

I'm very luck to have a very forward thinking doctor and he suggested that I try CES.  It's a small machine (little bigger than a cell phone) that you attach to your earlobes

I don't know if everyone responds well to it (I was the guinea pig for my doctor; he's now trying it on all his patients) but my mood is better

Anyway, for me at least, it has been amazing.  I had pretty much given up on the idea of a baby since I figured I was stuck on the medication, but now I have hope again.

I haven't registered him as an emotional support animal yet [you don't have to have the prescription to register them

It turns out that the man that had called me about my appointment was the director of radiology himself.

He tells me that yes, to call him [he then gave me his *personal* cell phone number] and he'll set things straight real fast.

He *also* told me that if I'm *ever* in radiology [even if it's during an emergency room visit] that Nova is welcome to come in with me and again, night or day] and he'll take care of it.

I started crying like an idiot while on the phone with him

So even though the events of today are still causing severe panic

The fact that Nova is being allowed into radiology with me [I'm not going to let him be in the room when the machine is actually running

That was part of why I had to drop out, and the way that you strain to avoid eye contact with this person, even though you only know them to see, he identified that feeling as shame. It was weird to describe one of these encounters (of which I've had hundreds) as such a simple word. Before I've tried to describe them as socially awkward, embarassing, self-conscious.

Can anyone else relate?",DrDiv,51,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/snv98/i_dont_try_my_hardest_because_im_afraid_that_if_i/

A quick background history: I'm 21 years old, and decided to take the noble route of dropping out and acquiring my GED through the local college instead of failing numerous classes, and taking my senior year over again. My anxiety would wax and wane, I would get massive panic attacks out of the blue, and anxious spells that could last a few days. During high school (and continuing after I left), I had a part time job at a local grocery store. There would be periods where I would miss a few days of work due to anxiety, and they didn't take too kindly to that. One week was particularly bad for me, I decided to quit. That was two years ago. 

It should be noted that I don't have health insurance, but it never really took. 

During the last two years, as well as less intense. However, there's a slight problem. During these last two years, I haven't really been doing much. I currently work from home doing freelance web design, I still live with my parents, I haven't stepped foot in a college yet, and most of my friends that I used to regularly see have moved away. 

However, I could have my own place, and I could have a better social life if it wasn't for this damn feeling that I get. I have this extreme fear, this crippling thought process that if I put any time, money, or effort into something and it boosts me in a positive direction, my anxiety will come along and drag me back down to where I was (or worse). Everything that I've worked for, my school, hang outs

I want nothing more than to be in school right now, what if I really enjoy it and it pays really well, but I end up a few months down the line having to quit because my anxiety is too much to bear? 

I know, or can give me even a shred of advice? I'd do anything to be in college by next fall, or at least take the first steps and see a guidance counselor for options of how to get in.

I have suffered, and the problem never really went away. 

I'm on track now though, it's achievable.

The most obvious first step is to go see your doctor. Nothing new, but better that than be anxious for the rest of your life right?

Now, then focus on your inner voice for 20 seconds or so. Differentiating between the two is the aim, so eventually your focus will remain on whats in front of you and you won't be hearing the voice that wants to panic. Try 15 minutes a day. Every day. This is like excercise, you won't wake up overnight with a six pack but you'll notice improvements over time. And then you'll want to do more!

Another tip is if you're nervous before a certain situation i.e. interview or presentation or anything, legs, look up, impose yourself on the space you're in. This sounds nuts yeah? So take some time today to watch a TED talk, only fifteen minutes, on 'fake it til you make it'. It sounds far fetched yes, but this really helped me

Can't imagine many of you got this far, I still worry alone or in front of people, but I don't feel like anxiety dominates my life anymore. It's good to worry a bit, but don't let it stop you from doing what you want.

1360282267.0,183k12,I am someone who has controlled anxiety- this is my story,Potaterkiller,49,8,22,"Hi
1. I first stumbled upon anxiety when I was 17. I had constant panic attacks, my life was falling apart. This stemmed from my friends thinking I would be crazy, the sudden panic of finding a perfect college and being forced to figure out what I wanted to do for the rest of my life, moving away from home, and death. I had heard medications could help me but as a healthy, active 17 year old athlete, I hated the idea of medication. My mother had convinced me to talk to a doctor, certain medications are not addictive, I could stop but just take it for three days. Three days later I felt great. A new person
2. Although my medication helped me with the sudden random panic attacks and constant anxious feeling, right?). I didn't meant to take anything from that class, but learning about buddhism, daoism, and others of the like, my entire perspective of life began to change. I took another class focusing on asian religions where we read books by these people (Diamond Sutre and Wandering the way most notable) and I was able to grasp a firm, spiritual control of myself and learned to control my body. This calmed me down greatly and I no longer have any concerns with death.
3. School still stressed me the hell out: I was a junior, took yoga and pilates. I gained more from these than I thought possible; learning awareness of your body really helps you deal with stress. I personally enjoyed pilates more (it is very strong with breathing exercise and gives you the best ab workout ever) but they both dealt with the idea of your body being only yours. I learned many destressing techniques and it was a great release for end of day classes with midterm exams. I learned to control my heart rate, close my eyes, and just release my stress and live in the here and now when I get too stressed out. I do this when I feel a stress induced panic attack coming on. Buddhism texts may have helped me a bit with this, but I really realized myself through these silly classes and have been going strong ever since.
I did have full support from both of my parents this entire time and I never did have to see a psychologist for this. But I found my way through this difficulty and realize that living with anxiety isn't something I can just throw away, job ops, etc.) and we didn't all adapt to deal with this properly. Its nothing you need to feel too hindered by and remember there are always people trying to overcome it :) Don't feel afraid to ask for help!

I would like to note: Almost no one knows about my anxiety. I tell no one that I have a strong spiritual side (because that sounds a bit silly) and I never really encourage it unless someone has problems with anxiety. People know that I am a little athletic,False,,t5_2qmij,1360302578.0,,,t3_183k12

1347285182.0,znhxv,How I completely rid myself of crippling anxiety.,buttcircus,46,2,26,"Hi!
 
Here is my backstory:
 
At around 15, I got in a series of car wrecks that left me very anxious. Around this time I began seeing a therapist and a couple years later I began meds. But nothing helped that much.
 
The problem grew and by college I was avoiding people as much as possible. Eye contact was a nightmare. I wasn’t even comfortable looking at my family. Speaking in class was out of the question. And I would get anxious in cars and sometimes I'd just freak myself out while alone.
 
Well, I’d perform tasks poorly, and ultimately I would just quit showing up. I would usually make up some convoluted excuse that I would leave on their answering machines, then never speak to them again.
 
Over these 15 years, which of course showed nothing, and other times I was given referrals to more Psychiatrists. Nothing worked. So, you get the idea.
 
Then, but that's what people call it.
 
Here's how:
I downloaded the audio version of Eckhart Tolle's *The Power Of Now*.
I listened to it over and over again. Despite the occasional unappealing New Agey phrase (i.e., and he mentions Jesus (as a Zen master).  Jesus doesn’t freaking matter here, so hopefully that’s not too big of a distraction. Anyways, I knew that Tolle was pointing to a deep truth.
 
**So
 
**Learn to observe your mind**. For instance
 
Now stop thinking. And wait and see what the next thought will be to pop up in your brain.  It is *this* neurobehavior that you want to execute. Always be watching your thinking brain with your consciousness.  Try not to make any judgments or analyses

After a while, and **you will be able to stop thinking whenever you want and for as long as you want**.
 
And here are two things that can help this process:
 
1. Realize deeply that it is literally always Now. This isn't meant to evoke a hippy attitude or make a philosophical statement; it's just an objective truth.
 
2. Feel your body as a whole from within. That may sound hippyish
 
 
 
Tolle makes many metaphysical extrapolations from this shift in consciousness
 
 
And so here’s what happened to me: I came out of my disorder 100%. Of course I can get apprehensive here and there, as I know very well the horrors of a mind out of control.

It's been awhile /r/Anxiety! I haven't been here in almost a month and a half. It seems that after someone gets through an anxiety problem

 
To anyone suffering or potentially may suffer from ongoing &amp; debilitating panic/anxiety attacks (GAD)

I'm a 24 year old female and I suffered for over a year &amp; a half of CONSTANT (no joke, night and even in sleep) worrying &amp; horrifying anxiety attacks for god knows why.. I still don't know why exactly they started happening to me, but they did and each time I was 100% sure something was wrong with me &amp; I was dying. It got REALLY annoying and really exhausting, I felt completely defeated by anxiety. I had to quit my job, and I lost all motivation, hope, and passion for life. I couldn't even drive places. Finally after having ENOUGH of caging myself into my own anxiety hole, I said alright, pass out or start ""dying.""

I forced myself to drive (even though it was horrifying for me each time) to CBT appts. and after several months of better sleep, I finally feel in control again. I got through it with no medication (SSRIs) that may make you dependent &amp; sometimes have weird side effects. Some people need meds and that works perfect for them and all the power to them, but I made the choice to take the long road of no meds for my crutch (except for .1 milligrams of blood pressure medication to help me get better sleep) and finally I've been attack free for over a month now... which is incredible. I can't explain it. I'm no longer paralyzed with fear every day and I NEVER thought this would ever happen. I never thought I'd get out of it.

I don't worry hardly at all anymore. The only time I've felt anxious is one time I let myself ""mentally talk"" to myself about potential fears and symptoms and I caught on real quick. I got out of the ""anxious mind zone""

I'm not saying I'll be anxiety free for the rest of my life, but I don't feel helpless anymore. I'm getting my life back. I'm feeling good, I've been able to start making goals, I'm set on going back to school in spring, I even planned my classes out for the next 2 years and am seeking to move out if things keep going well! Another huge feat for me is that I drove 30 minutes, all by myself, in crazy traffic

Anyways, because at least I feel better now and I know there's always hope to feel better again. All with a little bit of seeking help and change.

I love you all. Take care of yourselves. Breathe. Meditate. Eat things you enjoy. Watch movies you love. Laugh with people you care about. Start indulging and start finding small ways to feel like you're living again. DON'T LET YOURSELF FIND WAYS TO TALK YOURSELF OUT OF IT. Just do it.

**SO IMPORTANT: DON'T GOOGLE SYMPTOMS. FOR THE LOVE OF GOD.. DO NOT. Even if you think it's real... JUST DON'T. Watch how fast those ""diseases"", ""cancers"", and all those horrible things your scaring yourself with GO AWAY and no longer become relevant after you DON'T DO IT ANYMORE. ALL YOU'RE DOING IS FEEDING THE FIRE. If you want to google something wrong, just meditate.. talk to yourself. You're okay and you'll be okay, I promise. Please just try.**

The news causes a lot of anxiety for me personally. Not the intense anxiety

&gt;News is toxic to your body. It constantly triggers the limbic system. Panicky stories spur the release of cascades of glucocorticoid (cortisol). This deregulates your immune system and inhibits the release of growth hormones. In other words, hair, bone), nervousness and susceptibility to infections. The other potential side-effects include fear, aggression, tunnel-vision and desensitisation.

as I pushed it farther and farther into the cushions
as if the more I buried my head in the couch
the farther away my world would be.

And I was thinking about ""The Plan
That white picket fence
the degree I was supposed to get
the love I was supposed to find.
However

I let the anxiety flood over me and soon my whole body is shaking
I couldn't slow down my racing heart
stop the river of tears
or let go of the phrase ""It isn't fair...""

And I was thinking about how unfair life was
Dealing me cards I didn't even know were in the deck
Throwing my plan to the wind
and letting chance

You were patiently listening to my latest mental collapse
Unwavering
Never denying my reality
Just assuring me I'm not alone.

And I was thinking about the promise I had
Maybe I didn't have it
maybe it was all a lie built by educators
people unaware of the crazy just beneath the useless facts I could spit back to them.

""I want to be normal."" 
I sputtered out when my lungs would allow
I hoped you knew what I meant
I wanted to be the rock for you
when the dark memories of yesterday took over your world
I wanted to be the ground for you instead of the broken toy you were always fixing.

And I was thinking about how we've changed
How the roles we play for each other switched
How I used to be your sunshine when you couldn't find your way
I remember being sunshine
but lately it seems as though the sun has set indefinitely.

""No one is babe."" 
My heart jumps
I'm scared that this is all there is
My heart jumps
You called me babe and it makes me happy for a brief second
Knowing that you see me as I am
as I want to be so desperately.

And I'm thinking about normality
Is no one normal?
Do my neighbors, coworkers, and enemies shake as night while a caring soul tries to soothe their hurt?
Is everyone one stitch away from becoming frayed?

""I'm sorry you have to deal with my craziness.""
And I am
I wish I could hold myself together
So that I wasn't running to you constantly with a life shattering problem
that will be minuscule before dawn.

And I'm thinking about being messed up
Why am I the way I am?
Genetics?
Did dear old Grandma give me this gift?
Is it repression?
Because I can't seem to recall anything worth this kind of distress.
And I realize I'm the worse kind of messed up
The kind that has no reason.

""We're all a little crazy.""
That was the key of my lock tonight
Soon I can feel my heart slow
my heaves slow
and eventually even my tears slow.

And I don't know what to say
Thanks seems moot
You know that I'm desperately thankful
and I know you'll say ""That's what I'm here for
I decide to let it go
And soon we're laughing again
I guess that's just the way it is.

About moi: I have severe social anxiety, and I suffer from depression as well. 

For years, making me a pathetic fool in a world full of folks who were living life...while I was losing mine to mental illness. So many days of my youth have been lost in suicidal abandon...sitting inside in the dark, wishing I had never existed, while my contemporaries ran in the sun, making love, earning prestige, and becoming champions in this world.

I tried pills. Prescriptions. They helped

Since then

There is a song that some of you older Redditors may recall. [Baz Luhrmann's ""Don't Forget To Wear Sunscreen""](http://youtu.be/sTJ7AzBIJoI). It was a novelty hit in the late Nineties. Played at graduations and such.

The line that I prize most from the song is this:

""Do one thing

I have taken this to heart. So each day

So a few weeks ago

I am naturally introverted. Making friends and being sociable is an effort for me. But I can do it. And the more I do it

So I've decided to throw myself into the fire and see how I am forged.

There will be a few embarrassing weeks' worth of me forgetting customers' names, or forgot to refill their iced tea in time.

But this awkward

For in a few months' time, self-effacing thoughts as I approach her. 

I will be able to meet someone who will love me. Someone I can give my whole heart to.

I am flaky towards my friends

Anxiety has put a huge strain on my ability to retain relationships

I have a friend who I hardly get to see anymore. We were close in high school, this friend asked me to join him and his girlfriend at a bar that supposedly doesn't card (I am not 21 yet). The thought of getting caught bothered me. I asked him if he was sure I could get in, to which he said ""85 percent sure, but worst case is we go elsewhere with some rum in my bag"". Now, normally this would make me feel better, but I began to worry that I would have to get in their car and drive somewhere far away. Transportation has been hard for me lately, I only feel really comfortable when I am driving

After spending an hour and a half of giving him flaky answers and kind of deflecting questions on whether I would meet up with him, ""I want you to know that I am not going to come out tonight. The reason is that tonight I am experiencing a lot of anxiety, and getting out of the house is too much for me to handle right now. I don't normally explain this to people when I don't go through with plans, but I wanted to tell you so that you don't take it personally. In fact the only reason I have been indirect for the last hour and a half is because I have been trying to conjure up the mental state needed to get up and out of the house to see you. I don't talk about my anxiety much, but if you have any questions you can ask any time.""

Now this felt really good. I think that being honest with people around you forces you to be honest with yourself. I felt a little down on myself for ""giving in"" to my anxiety by not going out

He responded saying

I said

To which he said

That was pretty powerful, but this really felt good.

He came over with his girlfriend and a few more of my friends and we had a great night all together. It was made possible by my communication of how I was feeling

Instead of sulking all night about how I wasn't good enough or normal enough to get out of my house and join my friends

I know I am lucky now to be surrounded by compassionate people. I know that some people don't have this fortune, to talk about your anxiety and make compromises with yourself and keep pushing yourself a little bit every day.

I will end this with a little bit of /r/Fitness wisdom- we're all gonna make it.

So researchers tried something pretty novel - they said ""fuck asking a person about mom and dad

Here's what they found: 

People with feelings of anxiety, nearly always have thoughts that they are in danger, and it can be any kind at all; danger of losing social status, being rejected, being physically harmed, having an illness, losing a job, or even danger of becoming anxious (fear of fear).  Your mind creates the danger

Interestingly, and depression nearly always have thoughts that they have lost something irretrievably, while feelings of anger are connected with thoughts that things are not as they ""should"" be, according to your idea, and that things ""should"" be different. 

Researchers then discovered that people with unhealthy levels of sadness, shame, anger, etc. all seemed to have **irrational, unsupported, untrue, and otherwise illogical** thoughts of the types I just mentioned.  For example, and those thoughts were irrational

So the researchers set out to help people **identify their thoughts

Here's a neat example of how thoughts

*Your coworker calls to tell you that the lottery ticket you bought is the winner - $200 million, helping others, taking relaxing vacations, and buying that coveted Reddit-monogrammed leather miniskirt you always admired.  But your coworker got it wrong.  She looked at last week's winning numbers, and this week, you didn't win.*

Objectively, without paying off any debt or taking any vacations, made you happy.  There was no connection between truth and reality and your thoughts and connected emotions. 

Here's an example of how anxiety tends to work: 

*You are going to a party, the old ""Munson"" syndrome.*

This thought is completely illogical and irrational, being vilified, and having people look down upon you for eternity.

Cognitive Behavioral Therapy teaches people to identify their feelings and emotions

* directly analyzing the truth/falsity of your thoughts by writing them and reviewing them
* challenging the truth/falsity by doing something
* digging into the foundation for the thoughts

My story begins in a land known to many of you, to this horrible land. Gradually it got worse, and while I was still in high school, all my friends went off to college and I was left behind, not really capable of making real friends. A year later I myself went to college, moving away and starting a life of my own. The first year was hell. I didn't go to classes, didn't make any exams, I invited someone I knew from high school to my appartment, and I don't think I ever will... But that's a whole other story.

During that year, just before the summer holidays. We spent all summer preparing for the new year, and during that time, I had a sort of epiphany. I was determined to start the year well, at all cost. 

So I met with a psychiatrist and we agreed that I would go all out on my medication the first few weeks (I was on 40mg citalopram, looking back on it, probably one of the greatest weeks of my life. I was so proud of what I did. A new environment, new people, classes, I had it all.

I will never have control of the dog.  It's not possible to have complete control of another sentient being.  However

6 months later, I was fudging about on the computer and drinking a lot of coffee. 3 huge cups on an empty stomach. Suddenly, out of nowhere, everything was moving REALLY fast, I was sweating like a pig, thought I had a heartattack. It was in fact my first panic attack out of a LOT of them.

So. This point in time + 6 months, waiting for the agony to end. I slept so friggin much these months, dreamt the weirdest shit. My fiancee took care of both our daughter and me during this time, the angel that she is.  Anxiety aside, the effects of my mental burnout was severe, I could barely think, speak

The time passed, so I did!  It started with baby steps, taking long showers and ignoring the panic attacks, futile as they were (in the long run). Just tried to enjoy myself. Few weeks later I had successfully went out to go shopping at my local small market! The anxiety was killing me but I had done it! SUCCESS!

Months went by

I am still not 100% recovered

* For panic attacks; Breath slowly, just keep telling yourself: There is NO real danger. What I'm feeling is simply stupid remains of our caveliving, cheetah-fighting times when these things was neccessary. I am as safe as can be.  Etc.

* For general anxiety; Set up goals, use that motivation and soon you're standing on top of mount everest screaming your lungs off! (By euphoria, not anxiety).

NEVER be scared to face your fears! They are nothing but fears

Also; If you are feeling anxiety anyway

Have a splendid evening

I've gotten better about putting myself out there when I want to be around people, the one who feels left out of the inside jokes, you get my point. Last night was different, though. 

I live outside of DC, with these two friends, it's easy for me to feel like a third wheel and withdraw from them because they have gotten closer in the last several months. Instead of withdrawing though, I faked it until I made myself feel like I was as included as I desired to be. While playing trivia, I felt like an integral part of the team and not just the tag-along. When we were all taking the metro back home, I noticed that my two friends were speaking to each other more than speaking to me; and while I noticed this and felt that certain discomfort I get when my anxiety is flaring, I was okay because for that moment *I didn't care*. I can't tell you the last time I found myself in a situation like that and just brushed it off. It was so incredible to just not care.

So when I finally got home with my roommate, and it was the first time I felt that good around anyone in a what feels like ages. 

It was honestly the most beautiful feeling I've felt in so long, to go back to therapy to work on my coping skills, and to find a psychiatrist to see if I can get back on Celexa to help with my improvement.

1354059803.0,13whdn,"Why you feel the way you feel (chest pain, digestive problems, head ache etc) from your anxiety.",horseniss,42,8, please correct me. I don't have any sources for this

**1. Chest pain**

When you work out too much, you will probably try to not use it until the pain has gone.

Same things goes with all your muscles. The muscles around your lungs and below are supposed to be used for moving the lungs when breathing. **The little tiny muscles between your ribs and collarbones are *not***. They are supposed to help moving your arms and neck. 

So what happens when you get nervous/anxious? You start breathing with tiny movements and move your ribs instead of your stomage. You will breath ""too high up""

When these muscles get tired, and the muscle next to it will answer by pulling back.

So when it feels like *""something is wrapped around your ribs""*

**2. Digestive problems**

When you suffering from anxiety you might get a hard time at the toilet, you breath with tiny and fast breaths at the chest. When you do this, you don't use your diaphragm. The diaphragm is the big muscle located right under you lungs. This muscle is the one that SHOULD be used when breathing, and it has more purposes then that. The diaphragm is located right over your intestines, so every time you move it - it will massage your intestines, and your guts actually depends on this massage to function properly.

So your diarrhea is actually a result of intestines that gets too little attention from the rest of the body. I know it's hard to breath properly the whole day, maybe 15 minutes at the end of the day. It will help.

Also eating more fiber is good

**3. Head ache**

Again, they will pull them self together, and also start pulling in the muscle next to them. This will start a chainreaction of different muscles pulling each other.

This leads to that the more tired the first muscle gets, and the more *that* muscle pulls. 

Outside of your head bone, I think). You can probably not feel it, and I'm sorry but I have forgotten this muscles name, but I think it begins with A.

When the muscles in your neck gets tired, once again.

When you notice this

**Other reasons for head ache**

Another of the most common reasons for head ache is that you just haven't been drinking enough. Remember, if you haven't learned it yet learn it now. When you notice that ""Hey, I haven't drank anything in 7 hours and I'm not the least thirsty"" - it means that you already is dehydrated. So drink, drink, drink!

(*Just don't drink **too** much

Also it can be from staring at a computer/tv for far to long. For your eyes and your brains sake, preferly every 30th minute but do it just as often as you can.

**4. Unbalance**

Many times when you feel unbalanced it's just as simple as the fact that your feet don't have any connection to the ground. But down your feet to the floor (this works best if you don't wear shoes, stones or any other patterned area) and start feeling with your toes on the ground. By this, you will tell your body that ""it's safe here""'.

Even if you feel safe in a place

Also, many more advanced, but this simple thing is all you need to do.

*Pro tip: Massageballs are often expensive

**Other ways to trick your brain**

Remember this - everything your brain get as information, your brain thinks that there actually is a murder infront of you.

So when you think ""maybe I fuck this up"", ""maybe i'm worthless"", your brain will not think ""the owner of me is thinking she will die"". The brain will think ""we will die"". So it will automatically starts to prepare the body for dying, if you don't do anything to stop it. When you do things that the brain autumatically associates with fear, like breathing quick and with tiny breaths, this will just make this even stronger.

So - what are the body doing when it's calm? I guess you all have at least somewhere you feel safe, walking the dog etc. When you feel safe - notice your body. Notice what it does. How it feels. How does it use its muscles? How do you breath? Remember this, and try to do this when you feel you start panic.

One easy thing is to breath with pauses. This is the things that's the effective part in square-breathing (I guess you all know what square-breathing is so I won't go into it, breath out and **hold it for a few seconds**(*it's important to do it also when you breath out*). I've never used square breathing but I've used this. The square has never made much sense to me.",,False,,t5_2qmij,False,,

Therapy was a bust and I was completely hopeless. What changed my life was a book: Feeling Good by David Burns. It introduced me to the concept of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.

When a person is experiencing trauma, I began to purposefully breathe deeply with each breath. After a few minutes, I felt a tingling sensation in my face and scalp while noticing increased awareness of everything around me. I guess I could say I felt more lucid and more at ease.

Breathe more slowly and breathe more deeply. The normal respiration rate for a healthy adult is 12-20 breaths/min and the depth (we call it tidal volume) should allow the chest to expand almost completely. My chest was barely expanding at all on each breath, that doesn't help anxiety at all.

1348454761.0,10dghg,What Is Helping Me [xpost r/depression],notemaker,34,3,6,"I don't know if this will help anyone

I've always been a bottler - anything bad that happens, run away from the negative feelings. When I was 12 I dealt with the death of my brother, that's when it started, I think. Since then, that's how I've learned to deal with pain - push it away.

Also

About a year ago, and suddenly I was in panic mode - shaking, heart racing, like I was afraid or panicking or something. I didn't realize it at the time, but this was basically the beginnings of an anxiety disorder. I had no idea what to do about it, but alcohol would numb it so I could sleep.

Then about 2 months ago, starting on a Saturday. By Sunday night, I was totally lethargic and apathetic - I knew this was not working. I called my Dr. on Monday and said I needed to stop taking it. Due to my having been a ""bad patient"" in the past, rather than help me, she released me from her practice. I was stunned - what was an anxiety disorder before became sheer psychic misery. It hurt to be awake - my whole upper body was in agony. I can't really even explain it, but my brain was on fire. I spent the next week in an alcoholic stupor trying to numb it away.

I found another Dr.

Eventually, I went bowling with my son, and on the way back, just thinking about the day and the week ahead, nothing seemed worthwhile or encouraging, anything I thought about made me miserable.

So I did the only thing besides medication that's been helping: I went into the bathroom and cried. Not just a little sniffle, getting as physically angry as I could while the kids are here. Thinking about the ways in which life has made me feel fucked over, unimportant, abandoned, and worthless, and telling all of them ""FUCK YOU!""

""FUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOUFUCKYOU!!!!""

After about a half an hour, I was craving alcohol for the numb, but now I don't need it (trying to stay away from it as much as possible).

So for anyone feeling miserable, despondent, please: find a way to let it out. Don't worry about whether you feel you deserve to be angry, it doesn't matter - let yourself be, let it out, get physically angry, shake your fists, take a baseball bat and break up branches in your yard (just try not to do anything permanently destructive to yourself or property

The first time I did this, and it's continuing to help.

It's really working wonders for me, never thought I was worthy.

FUCK THAT SHIT

So the next time you feel depressed

I hope this helps someone out there.

Basically here is how I made progress today

be **aware**.    

**A**ccept that you're being anxious

**W**atch your anxiety, whatever you like). By doing this you can maintain the idea that you are separate from your anxiety, which is KEY. This should keep your mind active and thinking about something OTHER than ""why do I feel this way"" etc. This really works, and I know it's a bit backwards to some, but trust me on this. 

**A**ct despite being anxious! Do not let it run your life, you are perpetuating the emotion of fear, and letting it win. 

**R**epeat this process as much as possible, and work on it as much as you can. 

**E**xpect realistic results. So, realize it's a journey that takes time!

More info on AWARE:  http://ukhypnosis.com/2010/01/09/being-aware-in-cognitive-therapy-for-anxiety/

Just by using this simple, where I have recently felt EXTREME anxiety. Like, palpitations, very shaky, etc. etc.  I was able to calm myself (not entirely, but enough) by taking myself OUT of the anxiety, accepting it, and realizing it cannot harm you

I hope this helps someone in a similar situation.  the main theme here of course being, and accept it!

The problem with that places like this subreddit have very few people talking about success stories and a lot of people in anguish and suffering.


I wish that I could tell you what I did to cure myself, I'm back at square one"" I look at it as getting congested or getting a cold for a day or two and then going back to being healthy as opposed to suffering with a terminal illness.

I wrote notes to myself over the course of my recovery and the funny thing the notes all say a bunch of things that sometimes contradict each other. But I want to share with you a few of my resources as well as ""catch phrases"" that I implemented to make myself better.

The first: 

Embrace

The second:

When you're feeling good don't look back and ask ""why, and now I have to find out what I did wrong so I make sure it never happens again. That just makes anxiety your focus. To be anxiety free anxiety cannot be your main focus in life.

Third:

I can handle it. If a thought pops in my head. I can handle it. If I feel a feeling, I can handle it if it does. 


Now as far as resources go:

[Free Online Cognitive Behavioral Therapy](https://moodgym.anu.edu.au/welcome)

[And the meditation subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Meditation)


Meditation has been my favorite way to deal with my negative feelings


Another thing that helps is to try and go 30 days without entertaining a negative thought. Negative thoughts will pop up but you learn to ignore them. This isn't that easy unless you have done the above exercises with meditation and the MoodGym. 


Also some helpful facts to learn about your anxiety. Your anxiety has no mass or volume. It does not build up within you. You can have a cumulative of muscle tension and tightness from constant worrying but you can visualize that build up leaving you and escaping you and being pushed out of you if you like. 

Also turn negative thoughts into cartoony thoughts. Make them ridiculous

I don't think I'll visit this subreddit again or really stick around to answer too many questions. This seems very selfish of me and maybe unhelpful but I know if I stick around here

It's not that places like this can't be helpful, in order to be anxiety free I must starve my anxiety of any fuel it may want to re-ignite and I really enjoy my life right now too much and love being ""normal"" (whatever that is) too much and have too many responsibilities to the people I love to revisit my old symptoms and other peoples symptoms. 


For me

Do what feels right for you. I created my own cure script and had a progress journal for about 2 years. I went 2 years anxiety


One thing I can say however is that it doesn't matter how long you've had it (as I learned from anxietycure.co.uk) once you start taking positive action you get positive results. But it's hard.


If I where to describe to you what it feels like to be anxiety free, and shiney, and smooth.  Your chest is open and warm. And your overactive mind is now chewing up philosophy and spirituality, and interests, hobbies, politics, life and no longer chewing over worries, symptoms, etc.


This is all very jumbled and I don't want to create a TL;DR because I feel like there has to be something in what I've written that has to help somebody out there, pure O, GAD. Used to take 100mg of Sertralin, now I only take half a 50 pill everyday (because part of me is afraid of going through severe withdrawals so I am weaning myself off VERY slowly)

My anxiety had mostly been about my anxiety. Feeling trapped. What if thinking. Fear of suicide. What if I can't handle it? What if I go crazy? What if I develop schizophrenia etc etc. Obsessions over physical processes like breathing (convincing myself that if I didn't breathe manually I would not breathe at all) touching

Phew. That was a lot to get out. But believe it or not

It takes a long long time to learn to embrace uncertainty and realize that it's actually better to feel that out of control fearful feeling for a day or two than just do the same thing over and over and over again and feel like crap forever. 


Best of luck to all of you. Don't hate me for not sticking around. I'm like Lot's wife. I can't look back or I'll turn to sand. Gotta keep moving forward. Much love to all of you and support and good wishes.

TL;DR Blah blah blah  Embrace uncertainty

A good therapist for anxiety must WORK WITH YOU.  This means trying different approaches, and having the experience to spot the sticking points and help you overcome them. 

From my experience personally, a good therapist should direct you to RESULTS quickly.  Like within 3 months you should have a lot of ""ah ha"" moments where you realize exactly what your mind is doing to you, why, and how to stop it.  Then after that you should be working toward automatically stopping the anxious responses to the underlying thoughts.

she tried to comfort me though. she knows i have anxiety and that i worry about breakups and she told me ""im not gonna break up with you baby dont worry""

Sometimes in the middle of the night, and I can't breathe properly because I'm hyperventilating, and sometimes can't even move to put the light on. Then I'll be scared that I'm dying, which makes me panic more.

Normally if I can't recover from a panic attack I'll go and wake up one of my housemates to calm me down.  It's really unfair

A few nights ago I had the worst panic attack of my whole life.  I'd been on a massive low for the entire day and nothing could pull me out of it.  I'd also seen my counsellor that day, which made me feel worse about myself.  I was lying awake in bed thinking, *I can't go on like this any longer*.  And then I thought, *If nothing has changed by the new year, I'll kill myself.*

I'd had suicidal thoughts before, writhing. Palpitations and hyperventilation. I had a loss of control, a sense of impending death I'd never felt before.  I was also face-down in my bed, face in my pillow, and I couldn't move because it was so intense.  My breathing was getting faster and shallower. I was going to suffocate, and I was trapped in my own panicking body.  There was no escape.

I managed to pull my arm out from underneath me and reach for my phone

It took a while for me to calm down, for scaring him, for being a terrible, ineffectual, selfish mess of a human being.

I'm pretty sure if I hadn't managed to phone him I'd have died.  That scares the hell out of me.  And confuses me.  The reason I had the attack in the first place was because I wanted to die.  Was my body fighting my head

But what if he wasn't there?  What if I had nobody?  At the moment, in an empty house.  If I had another attack that bad, I might not be able to calm myself down.

I began panicking about that

I guess having a multi-dimensional imagination like that is like a double-edged sword.

I seem to be constantly practicing

If they say X to me, or whatever is in front of me.  This, of course, screws up my ability to sleep.  

I've always battled this inner battle as just part of my inner mental background noise.  I've never really considered it's implications in the front of my brain before.  Kinda like being a fish raised in polluted water trying to consider what clear

In a way, best verbal comebacks and defenses.  I know I have come up with some pretty clever stuff in the past and it's wasted with the fact that my memory just can't remember all those strategies.  That's a hell of a lot of perfectly good ""processor cycles"" wasted on trying to fight verbally/emotionally abusive people which my anxious subconscious constantly conjures up for me to fight.

I am in a relationship, I'm just sitting here/washing dishes/etc.""  

It's starting to slooooooowly sink in that there often seems to be a coincidence between when I am in the heat of fighting that mental battle with whenever that feedback is told to me.  

I used to fantasize a lot about physical revenge too

The thing is... (a) I don't have any verbal abusive people in my life right now because I've given up having many friends and (b) the rare times when a verbally abusive person DOES come along

Growing up in a family from hell

I keep desperately NEEDING to fight this fight inside.  As long as you can keep up the fight

I feel like an old soldier of a conquered country.  The battle is gone into history. The abusers from the other side have already have already had their satisfaction from their sadistic game of hurting their POW victim and enjoying his/her cries of pain.  They've already left

The old soldier still wants to keep fighting the war

I'm officially labeled as disabled now because they've won.  I don't want to know this... I don't want to feel this...  if I give up this mental fight, I don't want to feel it, I don't want to let it sink in to my brain that they've actually, utterly, completely won.  :'-(

I'm a 26 old student driver from mainland Europe

I'm not really sure if this is a common fear

I don't know why I have it

Is anxiety genetic? I have had some hard times getting to learn to drive with my father, pessimist (always assumes worst case scenarios). Could that have influenced me or 'taught' me this fear?

Even then, it seems to ease my fears a little, but I'm afraid that might become a habit I won't be able to shake (eg realizing I wouldn't dare to drive if I hadn't planned it all out). Note though that I'm not yet accustomed to just driving places, while a lot of people can drive to places almost on command. Furthermore I usually don't have a GPS with me.  

In trying to combat it, 11 second breathe out) the difference in time has an automatic calming effect on me. 

Alcohol also reduces the fear

I don't want to take any medication, as it only manifests itself when I'm confronted with driving.

I try to go driving at least once each day (tried to go for one hour each day, shift and get where I need to be, but the fear keeps coming back. 

Still, but I know my traffic rules). That's why I wonder why this fear keeps coming back, I don't want to be afraid, I just want to drive a car like my 18yr old niece and my 78yr old grandma can.

Any ideas on what else I could try

I'm a bit conflicted on whether I should accept said fear, things often get harder than they should be. So that makes me wonder whether I could perhaps force myself to forget I have such a fear?

1364827497.0,1bfaax,Klonopin and Xanax - a comparison for anxiety,sennheiserz,31,2,15,"I've read a lot of threads on here about Klonopin vs Xanax

I went to my DR and basically said I didn't like the high/crash constant pill popping of xanax and wanted something that I could take in the morning and be good for...a while. Keep in mind, not depressed so much.

I got a precription for Klonopin 1MG twice a day (I only use it either 1 MG per day or .5

I have to say that I'm really liking the klonopin. Here's my breakdown as I see it

Xanax (alprazolam):

Pros-

* Great for breakthrough anxiety attacks
* Great for knocking yourself out on a airplane
* Fast acting with a bit of a rush to know its gonna be okay
* Great to keep in your pocket to ward off anxiety because you know you can diffuse it
* If you smoke trees or do psychadelics

Cons

* Very short acting
* Very tough on memory
* Makes my stomach feel kinda weird
* I don't drink much

Klonopin (clonezepam):

Pros-

*  Don't feel medicated
*  The long acting properties means you don't think about it which (if you have an addictive personality) means you just kinda take it occasionally
*  Takes less than an hour to kick in
* Great for productivity
* Cuts off anxiety at its source
* Takes the edge of smoking trees without totally killing your buzz
* Nice warm feeling and relaxing
* Less amnesia
* Easier to get off of as it is longer lasting and tapers itself nicely

Cons

* Not great for instant panic situations
* Not very useful recreationally (yay!)

Having been using it for a few weeks now

I find the strength to be somewhat comparable

Best of luck out there

First time posting in this sub.  I've had anxiety since high school (26 now) and it's been well under control for several years -- just half-yearly checks with my psychiatrist

And then about 2 weeks ago my husband and I adopted a dog.  And there's seriously nothing wrong with the dog.  He is a housebroken, which is *really* embarrassing), unable to eat, upset stomach, insomnia, all of it.  Whenever I look at him I start to feel anxious and sick.  I wake up in the middle of the night when he's in his crate (asleep) thinking ""What if he has to go out? What if he goes to the bathroom?  What if he's sad?"".  He peed on a blanket yesterday night and I shook for hours.

Everyone tells me that it's a transition to go from no-pets to having a pet.  I understand this, and I agreed to get a dog so I have to live with my decision, but all I want is for the dog to be gone.  But I don't even want to go home because the dog is waiting there for me, behaving perfectly, and my entire response is irrational but I feel like I'm trapped in this situation and I'm panicking.

He explained that a friend of his had once been in a really bad spot and asked Lee if he could borrow his good luck for six weeks. Lee said OK, but Lee forced him to (again I don't know how). 

At this point I became aware that I was sitting in a car with either a madman or a wizard

I suspended my disbelief and let my curiosity come back forward

He smiled because he knew he'd got me hooked and he said ""you want to know?""

I said ""yes

He said ""I've talked to strangers all my life.""

-- Try to help solve someone else's problem: The worst times of anxiety are when you feel like you can't escape your own head. The entire universe feels like it exists between your ears--that's the number one way I'll describe it with people. If you have a friend you think is going through something

-- Do something creative: Graphic design was always my niche. Whenever I'm doodling my mind relaxes and focuses. Just like with talking to people, and the results make me so proud that I get focused on that--not my anxiety.

-- DO NOT GOOGLE YOUR SYMPTOMS: I cannot stress this enough. The first few things that will pop up on any google search are usually worst-case scenarios. When I first had anxiety I had neck and head pressure, diziness, panic attacks, etc. The first thing that came up on Google search was some guy thinking he had some unknown disease...he let it ruin his life. Every. Symptom. I had. I freaked the fuck out. Turns out, these people are simply hypochondriacs who have failed to deal with their problems constructively. You can convince yourself of having anything if you try hard enough. Nothing is more reassuring than seeing a medical professional and having them simply smile at you sand say, ""You've got anxiety. It's tough, but it's not the end of the world. Stay calm."" Whenever I feel compelled to google my symptoms I remind myself of how my doctors have shared laughs with me during discussions--reassuring that what I have is temporary and can be dealt with. 

-- Talk to yourself. Or be funny: I've been blessed with a pretty joking personality. A lot of times, ambiguous noises. Ironic, because it would appear to the people on the outside that I'm losing my mind, but in the end it helps me remind myself I'm still here. 

-- Exercise: One of the best things I ever did was start a daily walk/jog up and down the mountain next to my house. Giving your body somewhere else to dispose of energy makes a huge difference!

-- Eat right: Tuna, non-fried chicken, rice, cereals and trail mix. Chocolate is actually decent too. Avoid excess caffeine. 

-- Whatever anyone says, then it was marijauna. Both caused panic attacks for me. 

-- Sleep schedule! 

-- Herbal tea: Kava seems to help my body relax at night.

I've had anxiety since August 2010 and have been reading and using various non-medication methods.  I do have Xanax (.25mg) for the times that it's bad and I'm down to only needing it about once a month for a really bad day.  Last week, it had me in bed for about 3 days.  I did not take any more of that medicine because 1. my reaction and 2. my doctor told me to stop.

Now that the medicine has fully cleared my system, I freak and go home.  Then I saw my electricity bill that I have to mail off today.  I put on my jacket again, grab the bill and realize that I cannot walk **one** block to the post office.

After trying my various methods to calm down

Then I got mad.  And I mean pissed off, grab my keys and storm out the door.  The entire time I am stomping down the block, I am cursing under my breath.  This bill HAS to be mailed today.  It's the electric bill.  If the electricity gets turned off because of this damn anxiety, well what the fuck?!  No baseball, no tv, no internet, can't apply for jobs if no internet, food will spoil.  Fuck this anxiety!  It's thrown me to the hospital and doctor's office more times in the past 8 months than I've been to see my doctor in the past 10 years!  I had to take a leave of absence from school

By now I'm passing a group of people for the second time who are standing outside a building.  When I get pass them, cursing under my breath pretty loudly at myself.  Even now, an hour later, I'm still laughing at myself.

I honestly cannot remember the last time I have ever been pissed off. Everything I've read so far has been to be calm, I said fuck it, fuck anxiety.

The way to do this:

1. When you have a feeling of anxiety coming on

2. Take a moment and put your awareness

3. Begin to draw in a breath into the belly. Keep your attention on the sensation of the breath going in. The depth of the breath is not as important as focusing on the sensation of breathing. It is better to breathe slowly rather than quickly

4. Exhale slowly. If you can

5. Repeat (at least) 4 times more. The trick is to keep your awareness on the sensation of breathing, though, and it works pretty much every time for me.

In my years of dealing with anxiety, and the more you fight it, the worse it gets. I've found that yoga/meditation have worked wonders for me in helping me develop a more mindful worldview outside of the completely limiting, self-centric one that anxiety locks people into. It trains you to see things for what they are, instead of through a lens of fear. 

Anyway, I feel like I am not doing what I want in life, whatever I do is never good enough, and that I will never live up to my potential.

1338669508.0,uhmfd,Stop wishing for your legs back: anxiety and acceptance,mileshigh_23,29,2,12,"I just got done meditating

Here's an analogy to explain this realization. If a person loses both their legs, if they accept this reality, that their legs are long gone, they can live with this dilemma, but still move on to enjoy all the wonderful things that life has to offer. Case in point: I went to high school with a guy that got drunk and passed out on some train tracks. He lost both legs and an arm. To this day, this guy is one of the happiest guys I've ever met. His legs and arm are not conditions for him to be happy.


With this line of thinking, life sucks! Stop fighting anxiety. Stop wishing for your legs back. The real issue is not the anxiety, it's the judgement of the anxiety that perpetuates it. It's feeling the slightest bit of tension (which is totally human), and then your mind making it 10x worse because ""I shouldn't feel this way.""


The funny thing is, ""I accept this feeling, now why won't it go away!"", it's ineffective. Learn to accept anxiety like an old friend every time it arrives. Attacking the root of anxiety is to wholeheartedly accept it. Trying to consciously will acceptance into your life isn't very effective (at least in my experience), and for that, I highly recommend checking out /r/meditation.",,,,

I used to never be able to leave my house unless someone was with me. I lost so many beautiful days to anxiety. 

I developed an eating disorder at 10 years old because of social anxieties and fought with it until the beginning of college.

Teachers and councilors thought I was mute up until high school.

I lost my only friend because of my clingyness. Depending on her for so much must have been a heavy burden. Seeing her in the streets truly embarrasses me- I was such a horrible friend. 

I hated myself so much. I cut, garage, or attic floor and ended up with lice at 15 years old.  
I was a disappointment and budren for my mother. 

I never once talked to my college roommates

I would take sleeping pills to make the time go by faster. 

I think one of my lowest points was when one of the roommates had friends over. I had to go to the bathroom

But I think I've changed quite a lot in the past 2 years. I'm not sure what caused such a drastic change in such a short time

I can now go to stores on my own. :)

I can now go to a public gym. :) 

I can now eat in public. :)

I recommend you all do some research on local CBT clinics (they are, unfortunately
So, ranked in order from least-anxiety-provoking and least-likely-to-avoid to most-anxiety-provoking and most-likely-to-avoid. Your task is to start doing these exposures (often times as role-plays in the safety of your therapist's office) until you retrain your brain to realize that you aren't in danger (it's more complicated than that, but I'm sure you're already sick of reading). I am scheduled to give a presentation about myself tomorrow in class, which is my absolute highest-end exposure. A year ago I wouldn't even be thinking about doing this. Tonight I feel pretty capable, a manageable amount of nervousness, and a tiny bit of excitement to do it.

So awhile back I posted for support because I was about to take my test and I get crippling nerves over several things

Anyway, I was still nervous. I thought I could get through it but it took so long waiting. By the time I got to a different lady who takes my photo, I could feel it coming on. ""Oh, this poor lady doesn't know what she's about to witness."" I tried a breathing exercise I learned in Psychology class and it held the tears back, but my nerves were still on fire.

She asked me how many times I've taken the the test, and she asked me what was wrong. ""Oh no, we're gonna talk about feelings, and she doesn't deserve this."" I said everything. She took a few seconds and asked if I got really nervous. I nodded, then bit my lip, and started crying. I smiled at her a little to try to let her know I was ok, and because I knew this was going to happen. I said I was sorry, some girl crying

She was SO nice and understanding. I normally get kinda offended when people say ""Just don't be nervous, but through the tears I didn't understand so I asked her to repeat. She told me to get up and that she would show me (awww so sweet :,)) The nice old lady at the front desk looked concerned when we went. After we went outside and she showed me, I told her thank you. I honestly didn't expect her to be so understanding, because I figured she must get a lot of teenage girls crying.

She told me I could have my grandpa sit in the car with me until the instructor showed up, and it set the mood a little lighter, enough for small talk until we got started.

[We're gonna skip 99% of the test] My foot still had it's little seizure on the pedal, I recited what she said back to her.

At the end of the test, and turned my wheels the wrong way on the curb.) As she was getting out, I asked if I passed, and she said yes! I then rambled about how she's the best instructor ever (cringe). My poppaw was right outside the car, so he made some talk with her and I saw her mouth the words that I passed. He got up to my side of the car and I had this HUGE grin on my face. Then we hugged.

I went back inside and stood at the front desk. I saw the photo lady from where I was and she saw me. She mouthed ""Did you get it?"" HUGE grin and mouthed ""Yes I got it!"" She gave me a thumbs up, ""Well you already have it now!"" I was just like ""I know, I dunno what's wrong with me! (lol)""

1351536582.0,12afja,What's a partner to do?,bimshire,32,7,8,"So this is a bit of a request for advice, but she’s in a stressful job

The first few days’ ‘loading dose’ of SSRIs affect her badly, but it’s pretty hard on me too. The problem is that I feel really petty in admitting this; my problems are nothing compared to hers.  To be honest, I feel bad admitting this here, too, but I wanted to at least let it out anonymously. 

Obviously, and probably try to hide it. This only ever results in the built-up emotion escaping further down the line, and that never works out well. So I stay quiet. I have to be the strong one: I take stuff on so she doesn’t need to worry about it, and can concentrate on herself. Silly things sometimes, but this weekend, I didn’t get a chance to sit down for a minute, I had to do all the chores and errands. Now, I do these things unthinkingly, and I seek nothing in return. But it’s not easy. Even the sex – yes, so you keep that quiet too

It’s heartbreaking seeing someone you love so much living in such torment. But you can’t show the heartbreak. You want to leap in there, but I’m so thankful that at least none of this has ever put a strain on our relationship. It’s still unshakeable. In fact, it has to be: when you don’t know what you are doing, or where you are going – there is always this fixed point of reference. Us, and our love.  

But everything else? Well, and what if I inadvertently make it worse? I can sit and listen quietly, maybe prompt with a question to get her to talk. That’s good, right? But what if it isn’t? What if sometimes, this is just ‘indulging’ her? I know sometimes she needs a bit of tough love. This weekend, I had to insist that she get up, and we take the dogs for a long, but last week, different results.  

So I try and get to learn her moods, I just fall into that same old ‘guy’ trap of seeing a problem, and trying to fix it. Only it never works like that, least of all here. It’s compounded by the fact that not only can I never get inside her head and understand, but this state of mind is so far beyond my comprehension that it’s not funny. After 6 months of doing the Mindfulness meditations, she had a realisation: the state of mind she was trying to achieve was basically the state she thought I spend my whole life in. I’m normally calm and unflustered, able to react calmly. Of course she doesn't know that that’s not strictly true

So yeah, but I surprised myself by how difficult it was to do. I did need to take a couple of breaks to have a quiet weep.

This past while I've been dealing with pretty bad anxiety and depression. I don't know where it came from or why at this stage in my life (late 20's) it decided to show up. But fuck it

So anyway, if you will - because I'm normally nervous in these situations. Add the anxiety on top of that and this makes dealing with nervous situations like this even worse.

But I said: Fuck it

I told myself: Who cares if you have an anxiety attack? Make this the worst date ever and have fun. Don't put pressure on yourself that everything has to go well. Make it the worst date ever and have fun.

This is just a mental trick I've started to learn. I tell myself that it's okay to be bad at stuff and it usually relaxes me.

Anxiety is the wizard behind the curtain, without judging them, without wishing them away. Because if I challenge the anxious thoughts, the panicky thoughts, the thoughts of impending doom, then anxiety turns out to be a con - it doesn't deliver.

Deep pressure is often used for individuals with autism or behaviour problems to help calm themselves. This can be from a weighted blanket or vest for example. However
Pressure sends signals to your brain that help it regulate and calm down. Love the feeling of being under a heavy blanket or a great hug? That's why!
Some great ways to incorporate it are crawling under a heavy blanket, or even pressing your feet down into the floor (great when in a waiting room to help you focus before an important meeting).

1348121820.0,106il4,Thought I'd share my story and remind others that it does get better.,bucky2300,26,1,7,"I've been thinking about writing this post up for some time

The basic goal of this post is to remind people who are currently struggling with anxiety that things *can* and *will* get better. Your path may be more or less difficult than mine was (and is!)

Anxiety entered my life when I was just starting my second year of university. I had experienced bouts of anxiety throughout my life, but there was nothing to be found. To this day, I remain convinced that I simply experienced a change in my brain chemistry that had rather severe implications for how I would live my life for the next several years.

The first panic attack hit when I was out for a walk. For the previous few days I'd had a rather nasty cold, and that I was sweatier than I should have been. I started to feel afraid. Suddenly, my body shifted into overdrive. Every nerve from my toes through the top of my head felt like it was buzzing at full strength. This, combined with the still-lingering illness, was too much, and I started to pass out. I put my head between my knees, and the world came back enough that I was able to call one of my roommates

That was the first panic attack that I had. For the next four hours, whether or not I had experienced some kind of cardiac event, or whether it was just low blood sugar. I was terrified. 

From then on, for reasons unknown to me at that time, if I called my parents or girlfriend and spoke with them for a minute, the attack would subside. I started to exhibit what would become entrenched patterns of avoidance of the trigger scenarios - I avoided being alone, I avoided public transit, I took shifts that coincided with those of my coworkers. My girlfriend and parents started getting two or three calls a day from me, for no particular reason - I hadn't yet told anyone about the attacks.

Eventually, who ordered a battery of tests - blood tests, ECG, and so on. All of them came back completely normal. The attacks still persisted. Then I ran into a description of the symptoms of a panic attack online, and felt that sense of dawning realization. Every one of my symptoms appeared on the list, and the triggers for the attacks were mentioned as common triggers for panic attacks.

At this point, that I wasn't experiencing the symptoms of some horrible heart defect. But foolishly, I did not seek any treatment. I thought I could deal with it on my own.

Over the next two years, and this anxiety made panic attacks more frequent and severe. Previously talkative in class, I became more withdrawn. I still spoke up, but it required a conscious effort, and frequently after speaking up I would need to get a glass of water to calm myself down. I was having between two and three panic attacks of moderate strength per day. Still, I didn't pursue any treatment.

Then, already feeling somewhat anxious - I knew that I wouldn't be able to contact my mom if I had a panic attack. At 12:15 the bus arrived, and I got on. Immediately, I felt even more uneasy. But I persevered, and took my seat. The bus I was on passes through an area which has no cell phone signal just before it reaches the university. At 12:19, the bus stopped in this area to let off a nun. I looked at her as she got off, and checked my phone. 12:19, sweating

Finally, or of taking the bus on my own. If I was, I would have a panic attack. Fear took over my life. Despite weekly therapy sessions, I was more or less unable to attend class. This caused academic complications for me that I'm still sorting out. 

Flash forward eight months. I'm living in my own apartment in a different city from my family and fiancee, I take public transit and the ferry alone. None of this bothers me anymore. The panic attacks are under control (touch wood!) - in fact, they simply do not occur anymore (again, touch wood!). How, you might wonder, did this happen?

- **Cognitive behavioural therapy**

- **The right medication**

- **Support from those close to me**

I cannot stress enough the importance of these. CBT is one of the more difficult things that I've done, giving a lecture. The medication is also immensely helpful. I don't take much (75mg of Effexor daily), but it provides me enough of a leg up that the CBT techniques can really be effective. Without CBT or medication, I would not be where I am today.

The support from others is also of great importance. What I have found is that the hardest step for me was being open and honest about the problems that I was facing - once I told the people I trusted about my anxiety, but bottling it up did me no good whatsoever. Letting a trusted few know about it and telling them how they could help me was one of the key steps on the road to winning my life back. 

I don't think that I've ""conquered"" anxiety by any stretch of the imagination. There will be times in my life when it crops up again, you will be alright. In the short term, the fear that you have will subside. In the long term, you will learn how to work with and disarm that fear, and you will be free to live your life the way you want to again.*",,False,t5_2qmij,True

1345411974.0,yhmvy,Constant negative rumination after social interactions with strangers.,,27,0,12,"Hi Anxiety Reddit

I have had this problem for a really long time. It tends to involve social situations that do not go 100% in my favor. I tend to play out 'what if's' and 'I should've' - what if I said that, I need to stand up for myself more, I need to interject more, I need to be more assertive. It's a constant wheel of repetition. It often last for days. At worst, it's weeks after a single negative social interaction.

This has been an issue since I was a child

**Example 1:** The other day me and my SO went to the local museum and the cashier asked ""Are you a student? Students with their student ID get a discount!"" 

I was a student once at the college listed on my ID. I'm not a student there anymore, I said I was a student and showed the ID of my old school that I still carried in my wallet. 

He says

I say, 'So you think you're better than me, huh!?' No, I don't sir, I say. Sometimes, I feel bad mentioning I have an advanced degree where I live. I only feel proud when I can talk about scientific topics to like minded others, where I don't have to be ashamed. My SO says I act ashamed of my intelligence

My SO says

The cashier, Psychology bad...... at least for me."" His speech was in front of a line of people behind me that extended a good 20 feet.

Needless to say,' as my other grad school friends humorously put it. Other times I just let the event play out in my head like a broken record. I kept hearing, 'psychology is the worst subject!' over and over again. Dedicating six plus years to a craft, science, and knowledge and have someone say that made me a bit upset.

With my educational background and knowing what's going in my head, getting lost in a new york city on vacation), but little social interactions with strangers appear to be my kryptonite.

**Example 2:** I went on a camping trip this year, I nod to acknowledge his presence. He then says rather aggressively ""UTILITY SINK IS FOR WASHING DISHES!"" I walk away to use the bathroom thinking, wow that guy was a real jerk. Maybe I offended him. I don't know. Maybe I should apologize.

I walk back and pass the utility sink and apologize

The man gruffly says

I probably shouldn't have apologized and went along my business. I don't know. Assertiveness appears to be a weak link in me. I also wish I knew how to interject more. For the next day or so, students I teach see it, my coworkers see it, my friends see it, but others see a weak person to pick on I feel. If only I had the courage to say such things to break the ice or tension. Instead, I opted to buy a few assertiveness training books on my kindle and read them for hours on end until I fell asleep in my tent.

I'm still not that assertive after reading those books.

**Example 3:** My boss was training me to use a new piece of equipment in the lab. Halfway through the training session

He says very quickly

I looked down embarrassed

He just laughed and continued with his speech and training.

I kept playing out the thoughts, ""Oh just testing the sturdiness!"" I missed that opportunity. 

-----------

These are all recent examples. I gave tons of speeches and presentations at school or at conferences

I also have this inner urge to express my masculinity, but I know that's not right. To the dude in example one, I wish I could brag about all my accomplishments, educate him in some way, and perhaps even yell… but I feel conflicted to do so. So I try to let it go, but instead I just quietly take it and ruminate and hate my life for the next couple of days until the memory slowly dissipates. 

I feel as if I was **(1) more assertive (2) less ruminative (3) learn the ability to interject instead of waiting for them to finish saying something relevant to me...** I would then lead a more fulfilling life I believe. It's all easier said than done. Even my boss/mentor in graduate school mentioned I need to stop being so passive and agreeable. It is a problem

I guess a quick history is warranted. I just got diagnosed with anxiety a few months ago, mostly triggered by social reasons. I'm so terrified of even offending a friend, if I feel like a best friend is ""mad"" at me I'll hyperventilate and shake and just cry uncontrollably. Lately it's even gone beyond social anxiety and I'll just start sobbing and freaking out for *no reason at all*. I found a spider in my room and I was in a ball shaking and imagining that a million of them were crawling all over my bed.

I went to a psychiatrist

I went back to him and told him I could live with the ADD but my anxiety attacks were getting worse. He wanted to prescribe me SSRI's. For some reason the thought of taking them (and the side effects) terrified me. I had an attack right there in his office trying to decide what to do. After 20 minutes of going back and forth he got frustrated, and that's what I was expecting him to have me try.)

For the past week or two I have been constantly on the verge of tears. I'll wake up crying sometimes. I was sent home from work (waiting tables) twice in a row because I was shaking and crying before I even clocked in. My boss even assumed I had quit one day and I almost lost my job. Last night at work all I could focus on was imagining the guy I like having sex with this gorgeous girl he was hanging out with that night. It's like I forced myself to focus on every detail until I was crying out back

My body hurts. All the time. Headaches, but even when I've caught up on sleep/fixed my schedule I'm always tired.

So all I do now is work and sleep. I come home from work, and while I felt calm and collected, I didn't feel happy. I looked at the water and that sense of euphoria I usually get from being in nature was missing.

I do have moments where I'm having fun. There's periods of time when I can joke and laugh and feel normal. But the second I get a chance to think too much

I used to feel genuine happiness but lately all I can do is worry. I worry about what my friends think of me, who knows).

I could always deal with my anxiety until now. I feel like shit all the time. Tonight I'm forcing myself to go out to a friend's party and socialize and maybe it will make me feel better. But I know that one little upsetting thought will cross my mind and I'll be crying outside and chainsmoking.

I don't know if I need advice or just a hug or just someone to tell me to stop feeling sorry for myself. I know that I'm doing a lot of things wrong. I shouldn't smoke cigarettes

If anyone actually read this

I want to stop overthinking and overreacting and crying and shaking and forcing myself to leave the house. I want to relax and think rationally and laugh and kiss someone and spend hours getting ready because I can't wait to go out and be the life of the party.

Anxiety is worse than any physical pain I could ever recall. It hurts you deeply and so misunderstood! We're called crazy... because no one understands. Mind is constantly racing and your life IS your phobia. Screw deep breathing! I just wanted to be fixed! 

It started when i was 16

PASSING OUT... FAINTING... that was NOW my phobia. I live in the south east united states so it gets really hot here. Heat scared me... low blood sugar scared me... bridges scared me because I couldn't pull over if I were to faint. (Or so I thought) I checked out from school every single day... until finally they sent me to the school shrink and I realized I had an anxiety problem. I did crazy things like not getting in a car unless it was already turned on with air conditioning for a few minutes and I had to have an ice pack with me. Always carried bananas and crackers in my backpack at school just incase I happen to get low blood sugar.
After about 3 months they started medicating me. Lexipro...Buspar (both anxiety medications) stomach medication (due to the anxiety I was producing too much stomach acid) I was in HELL... I wanted to die. This was no way to live... I surely couldn't live like this forever. I couldn't drive... leave my house... hang out with friends. I was too scared... worst part is no one understood. 

Fast forward to 3 therepists and 4 medications later I met someone who saved my life. She was a Cognitive Behavioral therepist... after 2 years of my life wasted to my phobia she fixed me. She forced me to face my fears. That's all I had to do.. face my fears! Cognitive behavioral therepy saved my life... I am now 23 years old and on no medications for anxiety. Passing out is not even a thought that crosses my mind.  Here's a few tips she gave me: 

* carry your ice pack around to hot places... you'll use it until you realize you won't need it anymore. (Use your crutch to help you get out. Slowly pull yourself apart from it at your own pace.) 

*DEEP BREATHING..deep breathing always made me feel worse... like I couldn't breathe. So I started to count.. 1..2...3..4..5... in....5..4...3..2..1 out. I was in control. 

*crossing the bridge was the hardest thing for me. I had to do it because I live in a small town where you HAVE to cross a 3 mile bridge to get to anything worth while. I would call my mom everyday to and from work or school. Making her talk the whole way. Then... I only needed her half way... then a quarter... then not at all. (Again using a crutch to help you... I used it until I didn't need to anymore.) 

*always carrying a small snack... turned into just carrying a dollar or 2 to go the vending machine just incase I was feeling a little low and hungry. 


Anyway I know this isnt much but I wanted to give some people a little hope. Seeing other people go through something that controls their life...its anything but fair. Its a long road but it will get better... this isn't the end. :) ",,t5_2qmij,1338227298.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/u8xpk/i_was_a_victim_of_anxiety_disorder_for_2_years_i/
