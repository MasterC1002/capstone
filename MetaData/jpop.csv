A quick introduction : I've been a jpop fan since 10 years (since broadband internet became avail here actually). I remember how i'd scour the theppn tracker daily for new releases (and jpopsuki after). Lots of great stuff came out back then

FFW 10 years : It just feels like nothing interesting is coming out of Japan music-wise nowadays. It all feels like it's generic stuff &amp; AKB48ish (funky

What has happened ? Am i missing out here ? Is there still great stuff being released ? Am i merely looking at the wrong sources ?

With the recent kpop surge i am left wondering what happened to jpop.

I love to read manga and watch anime and speak Japanese (I just finished my first year) and I live in Seattle so we have some pretty good Japanese food. But I don't listen to a lot of music and I have no idea where to start. 

The only song I ever liked that didn't come from an anime was Hatsune Miku World Is Mine. Generally I don't like things that sound like rap and I would prefer something upbeat/fun over sad or dramatic. 

Thank you for taking the time to read this! I am really new to this but would love to learn and any YouTube links are greatly appreciated!

ありがとうございました!

EDIT: Wow! I Just woke up to such an amazing response! Thank you so much everyone! I look forward to listening to all of this today (my day off) and commenting on it.

I would really, so I thought that we maybe split things up: Someone can do a version of the Reddit alien, maybe someone else a background, etc.

Is anyone up for it? If not, but if you are ready to help... please do!

I know theres an underground following and stuff all over the place, I suppose my real issue is if there are hubs for it that I don't know about.

They're kind of off putting initially just because of how absurdly young they are (13-15)

And their songs themselves are great. I've only listened to their whole CD a hand full of times, Arigatou. Kind of a neat PV that basically plays the members of the group who grow up together and eventually move apart, but remember the time they had together fondly.

[Link to PV](http://youtu.be/cAYU1guQvuU)

Avex has now decided that there are other markets outside of the literally insular Japanese music market. Now they have decided to create Faky

""Better Without You"" is Faky’s pre-debut song. What first stands out is how unintelligible the English is. Even Namie Queen of Engrish Amuro’s song are not this bad. This is puzzling considering that three members are completely fluent in English.

""Better Without You"" shows the groups potential. The song does show off an international-friendly image. All of the members gave good performances. But ultimately it shows a group whose style needs to be perfected. For a group that’s sold as an original contribution to pop, this can be negated if the song stands out. “Better Without You"" is just generic. Due to how saturated edm-pop is there are many more memorable songs than this.

What Faky’s producers need to do is look at rising trends in American music and take inspiration from them. Being ahead of the curve will make Faky a truly unique music group.",self,t5_2rmjc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/jpop/comments/1jeeah/my_minireview_of_better_without_you/

I love LOVE Ikimono-gakari, since I don't know what the songs are about, the vocals are more important than usual) and I prefer more upbeat songs. If you're familiar with Ikimono-gakari, some of my favorites are ""Messages,"" ""Seishun Line,"" ""Natsuzora Graffiti,"" ""Kira Kira Train,"" and ""Nokori Kaze."" I do like a couple of their slow songs a lot (""Tsuki To Atashi To Reizouko"" and ""Tayumu Koto Naki Nagare No Naka De"") so I'm open to that
