Hello, lead encounter designer Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas, lead systems designer Greg “Ghostcrawler” Street, and game director Tom “Kalgan” Chilton. 


Our goal for the next hour or so is to answer questions you have pertaining to patch 5.0.4, content, encounter, and systems design. We’ll try to get to as many questions as we can -- I’ll even be responding to some of the less design-intensive inquiries -- but please be sure to vote on what questions you do or don’t think we should answer.

So I went through every video on the MMO-Champ preview and made quick notes of what I feel were the most important things to note on each boss. [Source:](http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2938-Mists-of-Pandaria-Live-This-Week!)


I'll be using these to copy-paste into /party each time before a new boss. I remember spending 5 minutes before each new cata fight and I don't want that to happen again. I'm doing it once and that's it!  

I hope this helps!  

**NOTE: This information MAY be dated/changed

##**UPDATE: This has been so popular I will try to make one for raid bosses tonight. If it isn't up tonight it won't be up for a few days since I'll be playing. Apologies for all the people getting upset over this

----------

##**Temple of the Jade Serpent**

**Wise Mari**

- Avoid water as much as possible. Come to back of room to kill water ele's first. He'll spin the whole time

**There are different bosses that can spawn here

**Lots of fucking suns boss**

- DPS all the suns down, simply tank and spank him down.

**Anger &amp; Strife**

- Doing damage causes a debuff on the boss. At 10 stacks they become immune and do MASSIVE damage. Stay on the same target

**Liu Flameheart**

- Avoid flame waves. Avoid fire on the ground. Only the tank should be in front of the boss.

**Sha of Doubt**

- Phase 1: Spread out

- Phase 2: EVERYONE stack up and DPS down the adds as fast as possible. If adds DO NOT die they explode for huge damage and it'll probably be a wipe.

----------

##**Stormstout Brewery**

**Ook-Ook**

- Everyone but tank get behind him. Avoid his frontal-cone ground-pound

**Gauntlet**

- This is a gauntlet, the monsters will never stop spawning.

**Hoptallus**

- Get out of his Furlwind. Avoid his Carrot Breath when he spins slowly in a circle. Tank be ready to pick up lots of adds and DPS need to AOE them down. They still drop TNT and Hammers so pickup hammers for AOE and avoid TNT.

**Yan-Zhu the Uncasked NOTE! This fight can be different! If you have the jump debuff

- You can jump VERY high this fight. When he casts Bubble Shield, the bubbles reduce the damage he takes. Also, jump high and avoid the beer waves that come across the room.

- Most important thing is to kill his adds

----------

##**Mogu'shan Palace**

**1st Bosses**

- Kai the brute, avoid whirlwinds, interrupt lightning bolts, run out during hurricane. Haiyan the unstoppable, dispel conflagurate, STACK on meteor target to split damage.

**Gekkan**

- Each add gives him a buff, Oracle heals, Hexer casts stacking debuff on random player. CC appropriately.

**Xin the weaponmaster**

- Avoid his weapons, crossbow trap just heal the damage.

----------

##**Siege of Niuzao Temple**

**Please interrupt trash as best you can

**Vizier Jin'bak**

- The puddle in the middle of the room is the most important thing. It grows over time OR when a sap globule from the outside reaches the middle. 

- The only way to shrink it is to take turns standing in it

**Please keep interrupting trash!** 

**Commander Vo'jak**

- Talk to one of the NPCs

- Waves of mobs will come up the stairs. Healer and Ranged DPS use the tar bombs on the ledge to weaken them as much as possible. If they make it to the top

- When the commander finally comes up the stairs

**General Pa'valak**

- He will throw his sword at the ranged, right click the bombs and throw them at the adds + him and his Bulwark. Rinse and repeat.

**Wing Leader Ner'onok**

- If you get hit with his Resin

----------

##**Scarlet Halls**

**Commander Lindon**

- HEALER don't grab a shield

**Houndmaster Braun**

- DPS the boss in the middle of the room

**Armsmaster Harlan**

- Simply DPS the boss, DO NOT get hit by this or you die. If you're able to dispell Enrages, please dispel him as much as possible.

**Flameweaver Koegler**

- Interrupt and spellsteal/dispell him as much as possible. When he casts Book Burner

- Also be sure to avoid his Dragon's Breath

----------

##**Scarlet Monastery**

**Always prioritize killing the piles first

**Thalnos the Souldrender**

- Stay out of purple circles on the ground, if they become empowered zombies they do A LOT of damage so tank pop cooldowns. 

- DPS should stay on the boss

**Brother Korloff**

- Get out of his firestorm kick once he leaps. Big heals during his channeled punches. At 50% tank you MUST kite him around

**Clear ALL trash before pulling.**

**Commander Durand**

- Same as the old version. When she resurrects him, done.

----------

##**Scholomance**

**Instructor Chillheart**

- An ice wall will form and move towards us slowly. It INSTANTLY kills you if you touch it. Stay spread out at all times. After he casts Touch of the Grave

- When he dies

**Jandice Barov**

- EVERYONE including the tank, just get behind her.

- At 66% and 33% she splits into duplicates. Single target them all down until the real one is found. Rinse and repeat

**Rattlegore**

- Make sure you find an orange glowing bone pile and right click it. If you get hit with Bone Spike this armor will fall off

- Avoid blue fire. His damage increases over the fight so tank

**Lilian Voss**

- Three phases

- Phase 2: Stay spread out. She will fixate on someone and that person must run away from her.

- Phase 3: Everything combined. Think of it as phase 1 but if you get fixated

**Pull these Bored Students carefully! They do a lot of damage!**  

**Professor Slate is a tank and spank.**  

**Darkmaster Gandling**  

- When he casts Rise! He takes 50% less damage
He will cast Harsh Lesson randomly

- Healers/Tanks look for mobs to dispel, then kill adds and come back.

----------

##**Shadow-Pan Monastery**

**Gu Cloudstrike**

- Phase 1: Don't stand in lightning on the ground. 

- Phase 2: He becomes immune. We need to kill his dragon. Stay away from the dragons breath and tail and SAFELY stack up near the side of the dragon. Spam heals when the debuff goes out.

- Phase 3: DPS Race

**Master Snowdrift**

- Tank will gather all the adds and we DPS them down

**Taran Zhu**

- Don't let your hatred get to full, either be IN it or OUT of it.

- Gripping Hatred spheres pull us in

* Get to the Skies.  Purchase flying for 2500g (easily acquired by questing 89-90)

* Visit Wrathion.  He is located in an area pinched by Kun-lai Summit

* Head to your capital city (Orgrimmar or Stormwind) and acquire pop-up quest to head to the Isle of Thunder

* Head to the Isle of Thunder and complete the scenarios that open up the Island of Thunder's phasing to current day

* Find yourself a Trove of the Thunder King (rare chest) or a rare mob on the Isle of Thunder.  Acquire a Key to Lei Shen's Treasure Trove.  

* Complete the Treasure Trove scenario by opening up every chest you see.  Focus on acquiring every chest you see, left side of the hallway to the 2nd room, and the 2nd room.  Head to Youtube for best pathing guides.  Pray for Burial Trove Keys and make a goal to get approximately 15-16 Elder Charms of Good Fortune.  If you acquire enough rep tokens to make it to Honored, make sure you visit the Quartermaster and purchase a 476 belt for approximately 425g.

* Head to Cho's place and complete his quests to do the two new scenarios

* Attempt to get in a Sha of Anger kill as well as a Galleon kill.  Use 2 of your Elder Charms of Good Fortune and may the RNG gods treat you well.  With any luck

* Head to Durotar (unsure of Alliance equivalent) and do the small event chain that opens up the weekly quest to gather 150 of each resource from the Northern Barrens (avoiding details to not spoil plot).  Make sure you get into a group that is killing the Commanders to acquire lots of resources fast (should kill about 6-8 Commanders for 150 of each resource)

* When you acquire your Mojo when turning in weekly quest (+200 Valor), head to the AH and see if you can find Latent Kor'kron Armor for around 1k gold.  If so, buy.  

* Head to Kun-lai Summit with your quest and help the old Panda up the mountain.  Acquire item level 502 boots for your troubles.  

* If you are using a weapon that is less than 450 item level, and 2H DKs, you'll have to acquire weapons from LFR or Heroics

* With any luck

From here on out, do random Heroic Dungeons and collect any loot you can.  Your item level is boosted by gear you don't even equip as long as you are ABLE to equip it.  Acquire 463 blues and spend 750 Justice Points to upgrade them to 471 item level.  With some preserverance, you can enter LFR Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring.  

Once you get to 470, continue to run LFR HoF and ToES.  You can use your Elder Charms on bonus loot even after you have already downed a boss in a particular week.  Spend all of your tokens.  You'll either 1) run out of tokens or 2) get to 480.  If you run out, try again the following week with 15+ new chances at loot by repeating your Treasure Trove Run.  Also make sure that you acquire 50 Lesser Charms of Good Fortune to acquire 3 Mogu Runes at the lowest floor at your Pandaria capital city and go kill Oondasta and Nalak.  Use one Mogu Rune on each.  If you hit 480, do the following:

* Acquire the quest ""Heroic Deeds"" and find/form a group of 3 and queue for a random Heroic Scenario.  By completing any random Heroic Scenario

* At 480

Best of luck to all of you as you gear out your new 90's!

1360597011.0,18b90c,Played World of Warcraft for the first time this weekend,SoCal_Sapper,931,194,589,"Hello

So I thought I would share my experience regarding my first time playing World of Warcraft this weekend. I've played a lot of other MMOs including EVE

I created a human Paladin because I thought the bonus to swords and maces would come in handy while leveling up while giving me a nice bonus when I hit level cap. The first thing that struck me was how beautiful the landscape and colors are in WoW. A lot of games are visually attractive in their own ways (see the eveporn subreddit)

So far I'm level 17 and have been doing the quests in Westfall. The coolest thing I've seen in this zone has to be the cyclone with the land and trees swirling around. I wonder what had been there before that cyclone (energy vortex?) hit the site. I also thought the memory sequence in the Deadmines was pretty awesome too. 

For professions I've taken up mining and jewelry crafting. Ore is pretty plentiful so far but I'm having a hard time finding tin

The only frustrating thing I've run into is the 72 hour rule when switching over from a starter edition to the normal edition. I cant talk in local chat channel or a few other things. Oh well

Overall

tl;dr - I played WoW for the first time this weekend. I like it.

EDIT: Thanks for the positive comments everyone! I really appreciate the time you are putting in to give me tips on how to enjoy WOW to the fullest. I've been getting messages from people to add their battletags and I will do so. If you'd like me to add you as a friend please send me a message with your info and I'll add you the next time I'm on. You can never have too many friends.

I am unhappy about the announced expansion. So because of that, despite the fact that you don't know me or have any reason to care, I will nontheless tell you anyway.

I have been playing this game for an amount of time

There are any number of reasons why. Here are some of them.

1- The inclusion of these pandas will make the game very childish. I want a game full of magic and dragons which is not childish. I want a very serious and grown-up game where I can throw fireballs at goblins without pandas anywhere.

2- There is no lore about Pandaren at all

3- The inclusion of Pandaria and its exotic oriental atmosphere will totally ruin the exotic atmosphere of the game. Just like how the inclusion of Outland and the exotic atmosphere of it ruined Azeroth before. 

4- Pandas are dumb. 

5- Having semi-animal type people will attract furries to the game. I'm glad we don't have any of them already. 

6- Pandaren are a joke race. They are only there for comedy. Blizzard has never made joke races playable before. So they shouldn't now. And on that subject

Despite the fact that this game is the most popular MMO on the market, because clearly that is a franchise that still has a lot of life left in it, and has very very grown-up races like wookies and ewoks. 

I also noticed that they are wanting to make it possible for our vanity pets to DO THINGS!! WTF is up with that? I like my pets to just sit there and look nice and be utterly inactive. Doing things is stupid. 

So yeah, until I come back. Which I won't. Promise. Hah! You guys are totally losing out here. While you're playing with your childish martial arts bears, I'll be swinging around a laser sword and zapping bad guys like a real grown-up gamer!

I really hope Blizzard loses all of its subscribers because of this,,False,self,t5_2qio8,False,,True

A little about me to get things started: I'm 28, where I also host The Weekly Marmot and PST. On top of that, I produce and co-host Legendary on Gamebreaker.TV, and just recently started a new series called ""On Tap"" on my own Youtube channel where I look at games outside of WoW.

I've been playing WoW since beta, but have been leaning a bit more casual since Wrath and Cataclysm.

Any question is fair game

The reason so many people say that Vanilla was the best is due to nostalgia and the social aspect of it. If you really compare the game play of Vanilla to Cata you'll find that it is not the best. Questing was boring an it took forever to grind your way to level 60, and the classes were inferior to how they are now. Sure some people stood out because of their gear but I never really found that very important.

So

**EDIT 1: Karazhan video will be first

**EDIT 2: DUE TO POPULAR DEMAND I will be recording only mechanics based fights. If the boss fight is a simple ""hit him with that sharp thing until he's dead"" then there's no need to watch me do it. If you actually have to do something

**EDIT 3: I've shortened the Kara video to be ONLY the chess event. Every single boss fight in that place is a tank and spank

As he was walking down the isle

The older lady looks at him and says ""I don't like you gang types!  I don't want you in my store making some trouble.""  This confused my husband

My husband says to her ""I don't know what you mean.""

The older lady pointed at his hat and said ""You people and your gang symbols.  Why do you have to be coming in here?""

My husband at that point tried to explain to the lady what the symbol on the hat was, waiting to pass.  Frustrated my husband finally yells ""Loktar!"" at the lady and she gets all in a panic, running off. This was met with laughter by a bunch of the other patrons in the store that had overheard the whole thing and my husband goes to finish his shopping.

Fast forward a few hours. My father comes home and immediately comes into my room. He drags me downstairs and asks why there's glass on the floor. We had recently moved into a new house and our front door had big glass panels on it which were now shattered all over the floor. We noticed that the glass panels had been broken so that someone could reach in and open the door (at the time we kept a key inside the lock of the door). Nothing seemed to be missing but we filed a police report and eventually all went to sleep with metal baseball bats next to our beds. 

A couple weeks later we hear back from the police. They ended up catching the criminal who had been chain breaking and entering houses recently. He confessed that he had decided against stealing anything from my house because he claimed that he had ""heard people upstairs"" and had ran. In sum

But one day, we got a message from his father on the guild forums. He was killed on a car accident. He was only 23, and his family and girlfriend were devastated, as everyone in the guild as well. We offered our condolences to the family and raided as a 24 man group for about a month, not wanting to replace him.

Time passed, and his toon was standing in the middle of Orgrimmar, not moving. We were horrified, thinking someone hacked his account. But we were wrong.

It was his father. He knew that WoW was a big part of his son's life and he felt that, simply because he didn't know how to. He was completely new at the game, but wanted to learn, from scratch, as a sort of ""homage"" to his son. And we taught him. We stood with him for hours and hours, trying to give him back all the time and effort that his son gave to us. And he actually became a pretty good Ret pally! He ended up filling his son's spot on the raid, and was key to our first Lich King kill. Since then, but last time i checked

**FAQ**

Here are some questions that have popped up often and some answers to them

* **How can I make gold without professions?**

While more professions will allow you to make more gold there are a few ways to make gold without using professions.

*Transmog Flipping:* Buying good-looking items when they are posted for cheap; reselling them higher to people using them for transmogrification outfits.  Jim's done a great compilation for this which can be found [here.](http://hatchery.powerwordgold.net/2012/08/the-definitive-transmog-shopping-list.html)

*Darkmoon Card Flipping:* Buying MoP-level Darkmoon Cards when they are cheap (when the faire isn't in town

*Vendor Item Reselling:* Vendors all over the game sell recipes, if you want the new channel it's [here.](http://www.youtube.com/goclockworkriot))

*Arbitrage:* Buying items on one faction where they are very cheap and using the Neutral AH to move them to the more expensive faction for selling.

*83-84 Greens Flipping:* Leveling players like to have the best stats and often you can buy MoP-item-level greens to sell to players who gear up at the Auction House. Jim did [a post about this](http://www.powerwordgold.net/2012/09/level-83-84-mists-items-time-to-stock-up.html) a while back.

* **What is the most profitable profession to have?**

This will vary by server as well as by how much time you can put into your gold-making. Generally speaking the most well-represented gold-making professions are Jewelcrafting

* **I'm new to the game or on a new server

The best way to get started on a new server or if you're new to the game is to level your characters with mining and herbalism. This will allow you to gather materials while leveling. Sell everything you gather on the Auction House and by the time you hit 90 you'll have a good amount of starting gold and can then choose which professions you'd like to focus on for gold-making.
