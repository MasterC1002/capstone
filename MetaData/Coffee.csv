1351009159.0,11yaph,A beginner’s guide to good coffee,Pumpkinsweater,446,63,166,"Despite the facts that it’s possible to buy “gourmet” coffee in almost any supermarket, either finding it at a good café

1.	Most people have never had good coffee. Most of the coffee sold, not taste. And over 90% of the coffee is incredibly, incredibly stale. Virtually 100% of the coffee in the supermarket, and restaurants, most of the coffee in cafes is stale. Even “fancy” cafes like starbucks or pete’s are serving stale coffee.
2.	Not only that, and starts tasting like burnt carbohydrates, proteins and sugar. So, if you have a bunch of cheap commodity coffee and it’s going to sit in warehouses and on shelves going stale for months before it gets sold or served, might as well roast it dark so it will taste like something. But this is an incredibly generic and boring flavor, it’s the flavor of burnt toast, burnt caramel and roasted/burnt nuts. There’s nothing wrong with that, but if that’s the only thing you’re tasting in your coffee you’re missing out.
3.	Good coffee is one of the most complex, fermented and washed to remove the fruit and then dried.
4.	There’s so much more to roasting coffee than just light, and roast profile and different stages of the roast to bring out the best flavors in that coffee. Unless you want to spend years and years figuring it out, we really have to trust the roaster. They’re the ones who are visiting the plantations around the world, and picking the lots of coffee, then they have to figure out the right roast for that coffee. Two roasters can roast the same coffee, and they can both be “dark” roasts and they can taste very different. Generally though good roasters will roast lighter, so you can taste more of the coffee and less of the “roast.”
5.	Don’t think that you can’t taste good coffee, etc.) it just means that they’re good at describing what they taste. They just have a lot of experience, and can recognize and name flavors they’ve tasted before. Coffee is incredibly complex, and it can be hard to describe the dozens of flavors that can show up in a cup, but that doesn’t mean you’re not tasting or enjoying them. Anyone can tell the difference between stale coffee and fresh coffee, anyone can tell the difference between $5/lb coffee and $15/lb coffee, and if given a few different coffees from different regions of the world anyone will be able to tell you which one they like best.
6.	We have a distorted view of how much coffee should cost because the market is flooded with cheap, picking, process, importing, roasting and brewing good coffee is a hard process, and it’s there’s lots of ways to screw it up. Paying $20/lb for good coffee is an incredible deal, that comes out at something like $1 a cup, who are experts at what they do. The best coffees in the world are selling for $100-200/lb, most expensive

The easiest metaphor to remember is that coffee is like bread. It’s something we all know, most of us are buying the equivalent of stale wonder bread. And places like starbucks are selling fluffernutter sandwiches to cover up the stale burnt bread they’re making. But good coffee isn’t like the white bread sitting on the shelves at the supermarket, it’s a fresh loaf of sourdough right out of the oven at the corner bakery. And just like bread, it’s best fresh. Coffee is at its peak for a week or two at most. So, find a good local café serving the best coffee they can get their hands on, or go find a local roaster, or a roaster online and order some of the best coffee available anywhere

Actually, cool ass dudes


Recently my Baratza Preciso was grinding too coarsely. After some hasty self diagnosing I decided that I needed to re-calibrate the machine. So I went on their website and looked up one of their troubleshooting manuals. I tried to follow it to the letter but I'm an idiot and accidentally tore the adjustment ring flat off the machine. 

For a split second I thought

Fuck.

In last ditch effort

After talking for five minutes we both agreed I fucked up somewhere and this whole thing was my fault. Not two seconds later he says

No more questions asked. Did I mention my grinder was refurbished? And now he's sending me a new one? What?

Pinch me I must be dreaming. 

Colin and I wax nostalgically about what it feels like to not have your morning coffee and then pleasantly part ways. 

Not ten minutes later I received an e-mail from Colin telling him my grinder will ship tonight and that I will find a pre-paid shipping label to send back ""my defective grinder"" (even though we all know what's really defective here...&amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;
)

Now, and limited warranties, Baratza stands above the rest. Through their altruism and concern for the fellow coffee enthusiast they have gained a customer for life. I will never, so long as I live, purchase a grinder from another company. 

Thank you

Edit: One more thing. Colin

Edit 2: I may have misunderstood him and may be receiving another refurb. Let it be know that I do not care either way. ",,t5_2qhze,1364344289.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1b2r9w/this_company_has_just_earned_a_lifetime_customer/

I decided to brew it and see. I don't have any fancy machine or anything like that, [front](http://i.imgur.com/gp2sZqN.jpg) and [back](http://i.imgur.com/Eu66Wcz.jpg). Here is the [coffee that was brewed](http://i.imgur.com/70ULf6y.jpg), pretty orange color. Sadly, it was a terrible welcome to the real world of coffee flavor. My buddy said it tasted like a bag of really burnt popcorn. I likened it to shit. I decided to add a little cream and sugar to see what happened and it turned out ok! I didn't feel like finishing it, neither did my roommates, for fear of pulling a Jones' Town.

Most of my advice will be budget-adjusting.  I’m going to assume you aren’t able or willing to throw wads of cash at a hobby you’re just testing the waters with.  I’m also going to start out assuming you’re starting out with no gear and no experience of coffee that isn’t Dunkin, I ask that you don’t tune out if you’re ahead of where I start.  Just skim, we’ll be up to your speed in time.  I’ve tossed this together so that you *should* be able to get a grasp of “how to start coffee” by just reading bold bits.  Plain text is more detailed, useful information, while italicized text is me rambling about details or giving more in-depth explanations.  I’d like to think they’re interesting, but none are essential.  

Because this whole mess is *way* longer than Reddit’s character limit, I’m really sorry, but I’m a loquacious man and brevity isn’t my forte.  Because I was a little dumb and posted backwards, sorting by age will give you the guide in reverse.  Oooops.

A Capresso Infinity burr grinder for $10 in perfect working order and a really old 6 cup Pezzetti moka pot for $3. The Pezzetti  was still in the box and looked like it was sitting in someone's garage for the last 20 years. See [here] (http://imgur.com/a/smZ4G). I used the rice technique that a lot of people have suggested for cleaning burr grinders and got it running perfectly. 

I'd also like to plug the gooseneck kettle from [this] (http://www.homeloo.com/shop/product_info.php?products_id=574) site

1321383395.0,mdd7s,I just blew my own mind. Re: French Press Water Temperatures,frikk,137,12,94,"Hi everyone. Coffee lover here. I roast at home and generally have become quite the coffee fan over the past 3 years. I use a french press and couldn't be happier. Or so I thought.

I've always thought that my coffee palette was just weak. I mean I can definitely tell a difference between ""good"" coffee, when I brew up a fresh roasted batch of mine it tastes stronger and more pungent than Trader Joe's french roast (which is good coffee, but no frills, and what I use when I just need to make coffee the night before for my early sunrise bike rides).

Last year I went to the [Coffee Emporium](http://www.coffee-emporium.com/) in downtown Cincinnati with my wife and we hung out with the roaster. He had a scale

Well today I went to make a batch of coffee and I realized that my new food thermometer that I use for home brewing was sitting next to the stove. I thought to myself ""I'm going to re-investigate what it takes to make the best french press coffee"". Here's what I found (I've done this many times before):

   * Course ground coffee
   * Water Temperature is crucial! 190-200F. **Boil water
   * Cover the top with the lid to allow steepage.
   * Stir at 1 minute
   * Plunge at 3-5 minutes depending on courseness of grind and taste.

OK so that's all good. That's how I've been making coffee (without the stirring part) for the past 3 years. It usually turns out delicious

So today I decided to check my temperatures

So, a dank earthy aroma, and a bite of bitterness that is quickly subdued by a subtle chocolatey taste. This is a dark roasted Guatemalan bean, by the way, that I roasted two weeks ago (so it isn't even super fresh!). I've always known it to have a hint of chocolate to it, but now it's like the flavor profile has been raised out of the noise floor and into full fidelity!

I am enjoying this coffee right now and still can not get over how much more ""full"" the taste profile is. I'm so excited to go back and re-roast all of my local coffee roaster's 20 or so different beans and finally get to enjoy the subtle uniquenesses of each strain. I am due for a free pound (every 10 pounds get one free) so I'm excited to do a proper tasting of their specialty bean - either the Hawian Kona or the Jamaican Blue Mountain.

So

-----

People on /r/coffee have been talking about it forever and [I have finally built a wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear_by_price) for it but no one but me has added any gear yet. I'd really like to get your suggestions, so please take a look at the wiki page, give it some thought and either edit page directly or post a comment in this thread. I will sort through all the comments and add it to the wiki later if you would prefer to share your recommendations here.

-----

This is the format I'd like to use for the time being unless anyone else wants to weigh in with a better idea.

* [Hario MSS-1B Mini Mill Hand Grinder](http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001804CLY/) - ~$33 - Cheap alternative to an electric burr grinder. Good for people on a budget who still want the quality of burrs.

**Thanks for your time and input!**

-----

**EDIT:** Great idea ajfirecracker breaking the comments up into sections

**EDIT 2:** Please don't downvote people if you disagree with their recommendations, like with the Mr. Coffee Automatic Burr Mill Grinder, which I agree isn't good enough to make the cut. Of course almost anyone can go into the wiki and edit it but I'm hoping all of us will keep the recommendations on the actual wiki good so that people don't end up wasting their money. That is one of the reason's we haven't done this until now, we found it hard to justify recommending gear as moderators but I think doing it as a community is great.

Also, so if I have to stop to search out the buying link or edit your description down because it is way too long, it will take me extra time. Thanks!

**EDIT 3:** I have noticed that some people are editing the wiki [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear#wiki_coffee_gear_suggestions) instead of [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/wiki/gear_by_price). I will change the link in the original post which was pointing to the link for the 'gear by price' page and wasn't actually the gear by price page.

1321229132.0,mb7hj,How to make exquisite coffee with a small budget. A complete guide for a beginner.,relaximadoctor,124,13,41,"To start: I am making this How To/Step by Step guide to making great coffee on a VERY limited budget. Please do not reply by saying ""OH WELL THIS WAY SUCKS

To Begin:

I am making this to let a complete beginner know what to purchase to create the best possible cup of coffee with a very limited budget. Buying expensive items is just not feasible. Drinking bland flavorless auto-drip coffee is also not an option.

**Coffee** ~$8.00-15.00 This is the only part of this how-to that is not exactly ""cheap"". Avoid any coffee that comes in a can, full of chemicals, and when brewed with this method (or any method) will taste like someone vomited cigarette butts into a hookers mouth after burning them with a propane torch. Many people load coffee up with lots of cream and sugar to cover up the taste of awful coffee beans. You'll find by buying good quality coffee, you need less cream and sugar (or none!) to create a good taste.

If you are a complete beginner with coffee, Caribou, or Eight O'clock roast. Eight O'Clock coffee is the most affordable bag of coffee that is semi-decent. 

**Brewing Method:** Melitta Pour over. $2.99
https://shop.melitta.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=64+007&amp;Cat=

Yes
https://shop.melitta.com/itemdy00.asp?T1=64+111&amp;Cat=

**Grinding Method:**
Hario Mini Mill Grinder. $30 on Amazon
http://www.amazon.com/Hario-MSS-1B-Mini-Coffee-Grinder/dp/B001804CLY

I've used this grinder. Works great. A perfect budget mortar grinder. ""chop/blade"" grinders are similar in price (usually cheaper) but they screw your beans up, you ain't got the money!

**Filters:** $1.70 at my local grocery store for a box of oxygen whitened #2 cone filters. 

**Accessories** You need a 1 cup pyware/microwave safe measuring cup to house your hot water. Can be bought for a few bucks at the store or hopefully you already have one somewhere! You also need a spoon. 

**HOW TO BREW THE COFFEE:**

Step 1. Grind about 1-2 tablespoons of coffee per 1 cup (you can adjust this for your own taste). Make sure the screw on the Hario is tightened to create a medium-fine grind ([what is this?](http://www.ineedcoffee.com/03/coffeegrind/) )

Step 2: Heat water in microwave (or stove if you have a kettle) to boiling. 

Step 3. Put filter into Melitta pour over (pro-tip: fold edges of filter to create a nice fit)

Step 4: Put ground beans into filter.

Step 5: Pour hot water (slightly below boiling temp 195-205F) in filter. Pour about half a cup in. 

Step 6. Wait until it drains a little bit. Take spoon and scrape coffee off the edges of the filter back into the bottom. Pour the remaining hot water into the filter. Wait until all water is gone.

Step 7: Throw filter away

This is obviously not the only way to brew good coffee

Do you have any tips?"" and he answered with a snobby tone ""umm .... do it more.."" He kind of said it with a smirk too.  When I ordered a black coffee for my mom, he also said...""here smell the coffee before I make it"" (after he ground it) then proceeded to stare at his friends and just smile... while I stood there...
I might be overreacting but it really bugs me when people think they're better than others; especially when someone asks a genuine question.

It just made me embarrassed and I felt super turned off by the place even though it was a super awesome little cafe. :(

We have purpose-machines to grind them as tiny as they can get ([here](http://imgur.com/aoxbQu6)). We mix the coffee with sugar depending on the users preferences, and to distribute the delicious coffee foam to the small porcelain cups ([here](http://imgur.com/4qfiPlV) it is for the unwary).

Here's the thing. You aren't brewing this cup for a panel of snobbish judges. You're brewing it for you. So forget all the silly techniques people will tell you must adhere to. There's a reason there's so much variation. Brew a cup you like to drink.

That being said

The second (and perhaps more complex) variable is the grind. We could go into the differences between roast depths and oil levels and region specific characteristics

Now. Water temperature is easy. Bring to a boil, but it's fine if you aren't perfect. Remember, hot water on top of coffee grounds. Easy.

Now we pour. Here's where people get insane. It's ok though. Only two things *really* matter. First, and the water will get sucked down the filter without touching the coffee.

1309846806.0,igyuv,I made a (fairly) comprehensive guide to brewing good coffee which should answer a lot of common questions ,smellgibson,114,17,38,"**NOTE:** If you have a correction

A guide for those interested in learning about coffee stuff:

**Brewing methods:**

**Turkish (with an Ibrik)**

* Supposedly the oldest type of apparatus that was used to brew coffee. It uses EXTREMELY finely ground coffee and is very strong coffee. It is brewed with sugar and coffee in an Ibrik on a stove. This would be good if you like strong coffee. More info on brewing Turkish coffee here: http://coffeegeek.com/guides/turkishcoffee

**Vacuum/Siphon Pots**

* Another old form of making coffee. It was invented before the press pot. Basically how it works is that boiling water gets pushed into a pot above it through vapor pressure
* Good models are Yama and Cona

**Press Pot (French Press)**

* A simple way of making coffee by way of filtration. Has a lot of sediment but is great for exposing flavor notes of a bean. It is easy
* Good models are made by bodum and Frieling.

**Pour-over**

* Another easy way of making coffee. Most people use it because it is clean
* Most people use Hario for this.

**Aeropress**

* A fairly new way of making coffee. It makes strong coffee and is great for travel because of its durable plastic material. It tries to make an “espresso-like” coffee. It is incredibly easy to use and clean.

**Auto-Drip**

* An automatic drip coffee maker (sometimes called a dripolator) attempts to automate the pour over process. Choose an auto drip that get the water up to greater than 190F (88C) and that has a good sprinkle head that will saturate the grounds in the filter holder.
* Pros: Automates the pour over process thus freeing up time to perform some other action during the brewing process. Produces good quality coffee if the water temperature is high enough.
* Cons: Not many dripolators sold in consumer department stores can heat the water up to the 190F/88C temperature and those that do are very expensive (over $200USD -- see Technivorm). The pots that have a heat plate can burn the coffee if left on for long periods of time. Some steel thermal carafes can adversely affect the taste of the coffee. Also the heating elements require descaling with chemicals in order to operate properly and to continue to heat the water up to proper temperature.
* Thanks

**Moka Pot**

* An espresso maker that is made by way of steam. It is the easiest and cheapest way to make espresso. I would recommend this for someone who wants to have espresso at home


**Espresso:**
Espresso is a monster of the coffee world and is very much so for only those who are very dedicated to good coffee and are willing to invest a lot of money into this passion. Beginners should not start out with an espresso machine. It is just too advanced. I’m sure some people have started this way but I still wouldn’t recommend it.

**Types of Espresso machines:**

**Lever machines**

* These are for the true espresso enthusiast. You are a part of every single step of brewing the espresso. These are not easy to use and are extremely particular when it comes to grind size
* I use a La Pavoni

**Semi-Auto**

* Most used type of machine for the home when it comes to the coffee enthusiast. If you want one
* People tend to like the Silvia for this. It uses brass tubing and has tons of reference on it on the web.
* Note: if you want a decent machine

**Super-Auto:**

* It does everything for you. Usually the components of such a machine are sub par compared to the semi-auto machines such as a bad grinder attached to a bad espresso machine.

**Grinders:**

* Grinders are arguably the MOST important part of making good coffee. Trust me, and uniformity of the grind particle size.
* **Blade** grinders are not recommended for any type of coffee brewing. This is because there is no way to make a uniform grind. Also
* **Burr** is what you want because they make grind particles in uniform sizes. Cheapest thing you can get is a hand crank mill.
* Baratza has fantastic grinders

**Roasting:**

* Roasting: what makes it so we are able to make a drink out of coffee. It seems to be getting more and more popular lately to roast at home. A lot of beginners of the home roasting world tend to use a hot air popcorn popper in order to roast beans. This is good because it is cheap and effective. The downsides are that you have no temperature control over the roast

* **Hot Air roasters** use convection to roast the beans. These create a brighter and highly toned cup because the roast smoke is continuously blown out of the chamber.
* **Drum Roasters:** beans are agitated by tumbling in a turning roast chamber. Roasts are more balanced between full body and brightness. You can usually have much larger batches with drum roasters.
* [Here](http://www.sweetmarias.com/roasting-VisualGuideV2.php) is a guide to how the roasting process works.


**The Coffee Bean**

* 2 types of coffee trees that are generally used for drinking: *Coffea arabica* and *Coffea robusta*. *Coffea arabica* is what is used the most and generally tastes the best.
* Catimor is the mix of both and was developed through science.

**Processing Methods**

* wet processed
* dry processed
* pulped natural

**Wet processed** is when the coffee cherry is stripped off gently by water. These seem to be brighter and cleaner. **Dry Processed** is when they are dried (usually in the sun) then the cherry is taken off. These are generally fruitier and heavier in body and produce more crema in espresso. **Pulped natural** is when some of the cherry is taken off, or wine-y.

**Coffees of the world**

For this part I will just describe what coffees from each country **generally** taste like. This is from both experience and reference.

**Africa (where coffee originally came from)**

* **Yemen:** medium to full bodied
* **Ethiopia:** specifically Yirgacheffe
* **Kenya:** very fruity
* **Tanzania:** wine-like acidity
* **Uganda:** fruity
* **Zimbabwe:** high acidity

**Central America**

* **Mexico:** mild body
* **Guatemala:** complex, fruit, mid to full body
* **Honduras:** full bodied
* **El Salvador:** medium body
* **Nicaragua:** full bodied
* **Costa Rica:** full bodied
* **Panama:** medium bodied

**South America**

* **Colombia:** mid to full bodied
* **Venezuela:** mild
* **Ecuador:** mild
* **Bolivia:** balanced
* **Peru:** medium body
* **Brazil:** depends on the coffee really. Lots of variance from region to region.

**Caribbean and Central American Islands**

* **Jamaica:** Home of the famous blue island coffee, rich acidity
* **Haiti:** sweet
* **Dominican Republic:** (a good alternative for blue mountain) balanced
* **Puerto Rico:** full bodied

**Asia and various islands**

* **Sumatra:** very full bodied
* **Sulawesi:** very full bodied
* **Java:** medium bodied, fruity
* **Papua New Guinea:** citrus, heavy body
* **India:** sweet
* **Hawaii:** mid acidity

In middle school, every week I would go to the coffee shop and order a Latte or Cappuccino and do homework (play Runescape).

Then in high school, it was the best coffee ever. After high school, I had a brief 1 year stint with Starbucks, and then got my dad's old french press. I found a coffee roaster not too far that actually let you order a roast and watch it being roasted, and from there I kinda went crazy and subscribed to /r/coffee, and my first (real) espresso machine is in the mail.

It's really simple if you follow the steps. You don't need a thermometer and it won't be bitter or sour. It should go without saying that you should use quality beans.

* Boil water in a oversizes pot.
* Take water off heat and uncover. Leave for 2-4 minutes.
* While the water is cooling
* Gently stir the grains into the pot of hot water.
* Let sit for at least 6 minutes
* Pour coffee out of the pot directly into a mug

The over sized pot is a good idea because it makes poring the coffee more accurate. The idea of grinding while the water cools is twofold: you takes 2-4 minutes so the water cools enough to not burn the coffee

A note about the taste, and I usually hate cold coffee! In my experience, bitterness in coffee comes from forcing the coffee through the coffee grounds like with a french press or to a lesser deggree with drip coffee, which is exactly what cowboy coffee avoids.

Portable version: Poor the boiling water into a travel mug to cool and add grounds directly to the mug. Cover and go! The grounds will sink to the bottom of the mug leaving delicious coffee for you to drink off the top.

However, and our reasoning behind them.  

&gt;.6. Respect others participating in the sub/maintain civil discourse.

&gt;.7. Please no posts scorning others' tastes.

So first off: no, mean-sounding rules that set the stage for thought control and censorship and all things mean and nasty that reddit hates.  We're sorry if that's your impression, and that's not our intent or aim.  

**Rule 6:**  We aim to have the community treat /r/coffee like an online cafe.  It's a fun, you can't order a drink, but you can make your perfect drink in the comfort of wherever you are, and sit down with some stragers to chat about the real black gold.  We want an environment where civilised, if highly caffeinated, discussion is the norm, and we've written the above rules to give us the same tools that cafe staff have in managing the conduct of patrons.  

Readers are asked to understand that conduct inappropriate in a face-to-face context is equally inappropriate here, argumentitave, or confronatational will be asked to modify their conduct.  We are and will continue to be very generous with warnings, and we see bans - even temporary ones - as a method of last resort.  However, just as a patron picking fights with others in a cafe will be asked to leave, we will ban users who do not take warnings to heart or otherwise are unable to play nicely with their peers.  For the most part, these bans will be temporary (Reddit does not have a temp ban tool, but also will ask the user themselves to remind us.)

In no way is this intended to force you all to get along.  We understand that coffee is a taste-driven topic, and that you respect them as a person, even if you don't respect their taste.  We are not final arbiters of disagreements, and if both parties are complicit, we will speak to both of you.  

Lastly, we also don't take into account if the recipient was unoffended - it's not just the specific conduct, but the example it sets that is important to us.  

**Rule 6 TLDR:** It is important to the kind of community we're trying to create that you all treat each other like real people, or behave in an otherwise uncivilized manner, and we're willing to use the ban tool if a warning isn't sufficient to get the message across.  

**Rule 7:**  We are a community for *all* coffee lovers.  If someone likes their coffee differently than you do, and none of your or this communty's business.  

We don't want a Starbucks Frappe lover to roll up here interested in expanding their horizons, got their start drinking sugary coffee smoothies and flavoured lattes, and worked up from there.  

Posts that do nothing more than denigrate anothers' tastes are unwelcoming, please find somewhere else to do that.  It is, in my opinion, sheer heresy, but it's also incredibly rude to tell them that to their face, and assuming that someone with those tastes will not read the post is no longer reasonable given the size of our community.  

I would far rather we welcome and take in the coffee smoothie and flavoured latte crowd and convert them to our more highbrow tastes than drive them off with pretension

To clarify in advance: posts interested in ""how do I start converting [person] from instant coffee/sugary lattes/double-doubles over to more interesting

In light of rule 6

**Rule 7 TLDR:** Someone liking something you don't like is not cause to hoist them up for public ridicule in /r/coffee.  Posts doing so will be removed.

What is the worst cup you've ever had? Describe the circumstances

I'll start - I was waiting for my car to get fixed at a Honda dealership, I had my copy of *The Economist* which I love to read, especially when there's nothing else to do. But I noticed there was a coffee machine in the corner one of those industrial sized ""Bunn"" ones (I think that's the brand) that looks like it's from 1992. 

Now, I was tempted in anyway. I wanted the coffee. What can I say, I'm addicted. You're looking at a guy who has eaten instant. 

Alas.

It was lukewarm, watery bullshit. I couldn't even finish it. I may be a bit snobbish with coffee but I like to consider myself pretty versatile and open to coffees of... various quality. I've been known to drink all kind of shitty coffee. Burnt pre-ground Folgers on a drip? Yeah sure okay, I'll have it, I *do* love coffee, you know.

In the past couple of years, making the job I once loved just a job again. Since finding this subreddit, some friends and I have been experimenting with different brewing methods. It's turned my search for the coffee I'm least tired of to the joy of tasting a well-crafted cup of coffee, reminding me of what I love about coffee. 

I once had an ambition to own my own coffee shop. Cynicism wore me down. Now, as well as searching for little gems like the 25 cent French press I found in a thrift store today that works perfectly. I'm in love again, so thank you /r/Coffee. I plan to stick around here for a little while.

Anyway I am a Barista, and because of certain things my dad has done divorce, leaving the family etc, I've been forced to quit uni to start working to support my family. Currently with all the bills including the rent to support my family, my net savings per month is in the negative (yes I am eating into whatever small savings I have left).  

Why am I telling you all this? Because at one point in my life
  

But then I started working as a Barista. I got introduced to the gig from a friend who started a student-runned cafe at this college. I was initially just looking for a full-time job to pay the bills
  

But when they talked to me about how a good coffee is pulled, but I kept at it anyway, until eventually, I could reach a basic standard.  
  

From there
  

I also started talking to people more, exchange students whom I may never see again. And this was something I thought I could never do ( I was a bit of an introvert).  
  

Eventually I quit the student cafe, so eventually I left and joined a new place.  
  

The new place has a much wider clientele
I used to be snobby at first
  
  

I've grown to accommodate such silly requests with a smile
  

I love the work I do
  

I love my job because it makes people happy
  
  

I know at the end some of you may be wondering, the effort and the heart that I put into my work (whether people appreciate it or not), and I also wanted to share my passion.  
  
  
I've decided that I would eventually plan to start a cafe of my own eventually that caters to a more personalized touch rather than worrying about costs and commercialization
  
  
Anyway I've never been a big fan of blogging and what not, and I would like to share my genuine feelings with others, and to let people out there know that there are some people who do enjoy their work, and who do work to bring happiness to others.  
  
  
I hope you guys like it too
  
  
tl;dr  

I like my job

I've been consistently aggravated with Ruta Maya for sending us horribly burnt beans. The ones they send us for retail always look great, and unevenly roasted, and make accordingly bitter coffee. Nobody else in the store really cares (I'm the only one there who actually identifies as a coffee afficionado), but every once in a while I get customers who have a developed enough palate to call us out on having a terrible, terrible medium roast.

I have been a coffee drinker for years. Just the standard stuff, made in a drip coffee maker. I knew that stuff was better than Folgers or gas station coffee, but I never knew what was really out there. So, I did my research and bought a few new coffee implements, a moka pot and a hario hand burr grinder to start, but I was still missing an important ingredient... fantastic beans. So, last week, I just wanted to say that and thanks to /r/coffee for all of the great tips and advice!

[Golden Gate](http://i.imgur.com/6x62dZ7.jpg)

* Disclaimer


**Day 1 of 2**
First stop - Blue Bottle in the Mint District. I had a siphon

**Day 2 of 2**
Second stop - Four Barrel. Hands down the most interesting decor out of all the coffee shops I've visited. Very cool and unique feel. The boar heads

Third stop - Ritual. Ritual's coffee shop didn't stand out as much as the others. I got a pour over

Fourth Stop - Sight Glass. I got there 20 minutes before they closed. So my experienced was rushed. The coffee shop was unique. Huge and open. In the center is the bar. They had an upstairs. Felt like a warehouse. I liked it. At this point I've already had too much caffeine in my system. I didn't really get to spend as much time here as I'd like.

**Day 3**
Had to leave early so I stopped by the Blue Bottle in Oakland. Grabbed an iced coffee and a double chocolate chip cookie as per someone's recommendation from my earlier thread on r/coffee. Neat location.

Stopped in Santa Cruz to try out Verve. Very chill spot. Completely different feel from SF. Chatted with the baristas. They told me that Verve has secured a spot in the Art's District of LA. Some competition for Handsome.

  Aside from the fact that a single extraction is very small volumetrically and takes no time to drink

1) You shoot it down en route to your vehicle

2) You pretend that it is OK to sip your espresso over the course of the next several hours.  It isn't.  The greatest extraction ever would still taste like shit after just a few minutes

3) You're going to top off the ""to go"" cup (usually 8oz) with the free milk on the condiment bar


Anyway, you arouse the ire of your barista, and SERIOUSLY, just drink it right away and you get to enjoy the flavor how it's supposed to be.

**EDIT-** Formatting

**LONG EDIT-** So there are a lot of apparently hurt feelings.  Words like ""elitist"" and ""snob"" are being thrown around

Tell me where in here it says that I refuse to give people espresso to go?  Tell me where in here that it says I laugh at people after they leave, WHAT AN IDIOT!""  In one comment below, I actually explain exactly how I approach situations wherein folks ask for espresso to go.  Since you probably won't go look for it, as that would require you to abandon your apparent hipster coffee douche assumptions (made well in advance of reading any of this), I'll simply quote it here:

*""If someone asks for espresso, and explain that it just takes a sec to drink and is better fresh. If they still want it to go, I tell them no problem and put it in an 8oz paper cup. Never impolite.""*

I also want to address a VERY common issue that is super prevalent in the coffee industry.  People seem to think that there is nothing objective in the world of coffee quality, posted by user chrisbooth12:

*""...no he is being an elitist who just because he works in the field thinks his opinions matter more.""*

There are several issues with this comment.  For starters, and experience has a tendency to teach a person a thing or two.  In short, I have experience, and offer advice based upon that experience.  In this case, working in the field entitles (or at least better enables) me to give some advice on how to take your espresso.  Recall also that it is just that, ADVICE.  I am not making any edicts.
Back to objective vs subjective - It is NOT subjective that your espresso will taste better (or at least DIFFERENT, ground, and pulled, with the changes coming more rapidly each step along the way.

Never have I seen a crowd with more pent up frustration waiting to dollop it out with so little reason to do so.

There’s a lot of bad coffee out there, depending on where you are. There are pretty much two options, one, find a good café, or two, buy some good whole bean coffee and make it at home.

How to find a good café. This is easier in one way, there are at least 30-40 places (cafés, bakeries, coffee houses) within a couple minutes walk from where I work, that I could go to for a coffee break. I’d only recommend two of them for a cup of coffee, and two of them for some espresso (three places in total). Two years ago, there would only have been one place. The best way to tell if a place is any good is to try their coffee a couple times, but often times people are actually reviewing the sandwiches, you walk in to a place

* The coffee should be fresh brewed, but you’ll see french press, and maybe aero press too. The most important thing is that it’s brewed when you order it, not sitting around.
* They should be proud of who’s roasting their coffee. Some places roast their own, and it should be a point of pride that they’re using good coffee.
* If the main thing they’re selling is coffee, not that their sandwiches or bagels are. This isn’t 100%, I’ve been to some good bakeries that also have people there who are really dedicated to their coffee and do a great job.
* As long as they’re not busy, or you want to try something new and interesting, they should be able to give you a recommendation, and talk about the coffee a little bit. If they’re really busy, it’s probably not the time to be too chatty, but every good barista I’ve ever met has always been happy to recommend something good.
* They should have different coffees available, something like “Idido Washed” (the region of Ethiopia and how it was processed) or “Ndaroini peaberry” (the region of Kenya and type of bean) are very good signs. Not because they sound exotic or fancy, but because they’re offering a lot of information. Someone has picked out this specific coffee for a reason, it might not be something you love, but it’s something that stands out and is interesting. On a similar note something like “house blend” is probably code for the “cheap and dark roasted to put in big milk drinks”.

That last point is probably the most important. Coffee isn’t generic and it isn’t “one size fits all.” Some people like bright fruity coffees, some people like chocolaty notes or nuts. None of them are “right”, you can get good coffees that taste like all of that. Some people won’t like one kind, but will love another, some people just like variety. But you want to avoid a place that caters to the lowest common denominator.

If you want to make your own coffee at home, definitely try them out. As long as they’re selling fresh roasted coffees (their bags aren’t sitting on the shelf for weeks) and their not burnt to a crisp (if their roasts are “french roast” or “Vienna roast” or all the beans look black and oily) it’s worth trying. Even if they’re not amazing, a good reliable local roaster is something that most people don’t have. Otherwise you’re going to be looking online, or hoping that a local café carries some fresh coffee. These are much more common, and you just want to avoid the bad stuff:

* Coffee has to have a “roasted on” date. Otherwise you have no idea how old it is
* Avoid roasters that only advertise very broad and simple descriptions like “bold” or “dark” or “flavorful”. These are probably generic
* Information, and these day might have been ordering specific lots from the same family year after year. You want to find someone who knows exactly what coffee they’re getting, and what sets it apart.
* The same goes for blends. There are bad blends out there made from cheap coffees, that’s a good sign. Some of the bigger roasters probably have to change their blends fairly often as new coffees become available, and old ones run out, but they’ll usually be able to answer a quick email.
* Again


*Edit* A couple of my standard recomendations for good roasters to try online: Counter Culture, Klatch, Blue Bottle. Check out their sites, and you can see the amount of information they have about their coffees, the choices they have for coffees from different regions. They also all have different coffees available at different times during the year as different harvests become available and then get sold, or when some particular farm has a particularly good year, etc.

Our family has a Bosch coffee machine purchased in the 80's from Germany. I guess it's testament to build quality of the time and place that it still works flawlessly after 25+ years

Basically the machine has two compartments. One is a standard drip machine which is labelled 'Kaffee' and then there is the mysterious 'espresso' section.

This espresso section contains a reservoir for water and a little plastic holder for coffee. Once you start the machine

I've asked a forum before about this and no one can identify the machine or concept.

I can post a video/pictures tomorrow morning if that helps. (It's almost 1AM here in Australia).

My wife had a heck of a time. She ground on 10 with the Mini Mill, and dropped the bottom of the Mini Mill all over the floor.

It's a bit of a companion piece to my long ramble on [why espresso machines cost so much](http://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee/comments/1603wt/why_do_espresso_machines_cost_so_much/).  But hopefully this time focusing on how you can do good espresso cheap.

A lot of people come onto /r/coffee asking what the best espresso machine is they can buy with a budget of anywhere from $100-300.  And the generally correct answer is that, that sort of budget is simply inadequate.  And whilst some people can get adequate results out of a cheap thermoblock, steam or pressure basketed machine, in general they are disappointing and frustrating for most users, and likely to prove a waste of money rather than a pleasing entry point to making espresso at home.

The hard truth is that, spending your money on an alternative means of making great coffee, such as an aeropress or pourover set up will usually or always give better coffee and more satisfaction than spending it on a cheap and nasty espresso maker from Amazon, Sears or wherever.

The good news is that having a low budget doesn't and shouldn't mean that you cannot assemble the necessary equipment to reliably make a decent to great shot at home. But the route to doing this is not necessarily through waiting for close out sales or compromising and buying that [insert crappy consumer brand] because its better than nothing.  You can do much much better than that.

The route I took was to buy used.  And to aim to buy as good a quality as I could afford with a (very) limited budget.  Over a couple of months some years ago, but otherwise intact for £60.  That setup (enhanced by a PID bought new a few months later) has -essentially - remained my set up for the last 6-7 years.  Sure it's not a Rocket Giotto, but it makes reliably good espresso.  And Ive not really been tempted or upgrade (spending money instead on lever machines to play with and rebuild).

And if you've got a decent online classified site - be it Craigslist, you can do the same.  Buy used.  Aim for the best realistic quality you can.  And look local.  Typically you'll be aiming for mid-market espresso machines people got as presents and are dumping because they can't work them out.  The Gaggia Classic is a the top of the list here. And you'll be looking for semi-commercial grinders being sold by cafes that have closed down and are getting out of the business, or have bought new kit and want rid of the old stuff.  I wanted and found a Mazzer, but there are a lot of lesser known brands that can be bargains, [particularly when poorly described](http://www.roaste.com/CoffeeBlogs/sontondaman/What-Brevetto-grinder).

To show you what I mean
http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/iberital-mc2-coffee-grinder/1006597047

http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/la-scala-coffee-grinder/1005582179

The first is an Iberital MC2 - it's a good cheap espresso only grinder that would cost £140 inc shipping new

But the bigger bargain is the second one.  It doesn't give the model, it's effectively a rebadged Macap M5 or MX that would cost you about £350-£500 new (depending on the model) and will give you a grinder good enough to last you for a long part of your espresso career, if you were lucky enough to live near Edinburgh.

A quick browse of London listings shows that Classics go for less than £100 http://www.gumtree.com/search?q=Gaggia+classic&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;search_location=London and even less elsewhere.  And surfing www.coffeeforums.co.uk there are guys selling well cared for _pidded_ Classics with Silvia steam wands for around £150-180.  Or (for a few £ more) you could score a basically unused Ascaso Dream, but its solid, nice looking and cheap at the price (though you'd want to dump the pressurised baskets) http://www.gumtree.com/p/for-sale/ascaso-dream-versatile-espresso-coffee-machine-in-cloud-white--perfect/1006305955

So for less than £160/$250 in the UK with patience and a bit of work (including maybe some grinder cleaning) you could get yourself a setup with a pro quality grinder and solid entry level machine.  Or £240/$375 if you get greedy and want that PID now.

That's not zero money

That's not to say you shouldn't be careful.  Steer clear of dirty home espresso makers or any hint of limescale or rust.  As that suggests a lack of care on the part of the user that may limit the life of the machine.  Look for a nearly new or barely used machine

Buying a grinder

I started out used, Canada, Australia and other places with an decent used equipment market.  Don't fret about your budget.  Get out there, aim high (particularly on the grinder), bargain hunt, and get making great espresso coffee for a lot less money than you thought.

I have so far tried this in pourovers and a siphon and the difference is definitely noticeable. Additionally, because it brews at lower temperatures.
