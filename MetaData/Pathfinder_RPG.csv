I plan to design them as nice as I can (I'm an Art Director

Features of the cards would include:
* School, components, etc
* Printable to Magic the Gathering size
* Minimal use of ink
* Designed to be easy to reference for new players

1369767233.0,1f7rof,I created and ran a courtroom drama. It was awesome!,harrypancakes,79,8,14,"First the story:

* PCs come to a large walled city: River's Keep
* Gate watchmen take PCs weapons to another room for inspection
* PCs choose to go to either the rich or poor part of town
* An NPC finds them in a tavern
* NPC offers a Bracer of Armor +4 (worth 25kgp) in exchange for delivering a wax sealed letter to the other side of the city. PCs will receive the other Bracer (making a functional pair) upon delivery
* Low power thieves ambush the PCs
* A beggar asks for money
* When the PCs get to the place to deliver
* Unlock/untrap the door
* Knights show up and arrest the PCs (take weapons, etc)

Now for the courtroom mechanics:

* The Lord of River's Keep is ill and can no longer preside over criminal charges
* A judge has been appointed to oversee
* To acquit
* All votes are initially against the party (I used red/green tokens to indicate the current jury standing)
* There are 3 ways to turn a juror: Diplomacy/Bluff check (1 per PC)
* The DC on the CHA based check is 0, 35, 40 for the 9 jurors
* For every 500gp spent on a lawyer
* The party can spend up to 2000gp on a private investigator. Each 100gp buys a question to the GM to uncover evidence. Every significant piece of evidence lowers the DC by 5
* Negative DCs are automatic votes

The prosecution's case:

* The victim is the Earl of Davinsh
* The letter is a hit contract for the Earl
* The Bracer's of Armor +4 belong to the Earl
* The dagger has an arcane mark that matches arcane marks on all of the PCs weapons
* The PCs were found at the scene of the crime

Evidence to uncover:

* [Weapons are not usually inspected upon entering the city](/spoiler)
* [The gate watchmen have been seen with members of the mob](/spoiler)
* [The mob control a wizard name Giasal
* [The mob has a connection to the Marquess
* [The victim was killed hours before the PCs were captured](/spoiler)
* [If the PCs didn't kill all of them one can testify their location (coming from the other direction when the Earl was already dead)](/spoiler)
* [The beggar can testify their location if they gave him enough money](/spoiler)
* [Witnesses at the bar saw the PCs receive one Bracer at the tavern (indicating the Earl was dead)](/spoiler)

I let the PCs roll their CHA checks and all 5 were high enough to win 5 jurors. Then they spent their PI questions retracing their traps and uncovering the story. Each of motive, that they could disprove I gave them a juror. Then add the lawyer cost, the last juror.

The party was the pregen cleric

In the first combat against the goblins, but now she loves stabbing things.

In the room with the fountain, the rogue's player threw her hand up to volunteer to drink it.  She took the AC penalty and we all learned an important lesson about letting the GM finish talking.  

Things were pretty good until the water room.  They even manage to solve the fire trap.  The cleric said, same basic idea, great RPing instincts.  But in the water room, all fucking hell broke loose.  The fighter had the best swim bonus and nobody was able to get the bonus from the obelisk in the hallway because nobody could read it, so the rogue told the fighter to take his armor off so it didn't hinder him from swimming.  Good RP idea, so I let it happen.  

The fighter, which I decided meant he dropped his sword into the water (that was my only Bastard GM From Hell moment).  It sank.  The rogue panicked and tried to throw him his armor on her turn, but failed her Strength check to get it over the pond, so that sank too.  Meanwhile, the fighter gets hit and grabbed by the reefclaw, and only has a spare short sword to defend himself.  The cleric fires a few sling bullets over and misses, and things are looking grim for the fighter, and she tries

They tried to ambush the arguing goblins, he said it was chanting and a flash of light.  

""At the sound of your chanting and seeing the flash of light

Extremely tense negotiations follow, lets them live.

On trying to climb the cliff, there's a rope.""

They make it up, but the acid DR from the Energy Heart reduces the damage to zero.  

Fighter get *MAD*.  Fighter *CRIT!*.  Fighter *NAT 20!!*

""OK

2d8 = 15

Cleric bonks the dragon on the head with her sling.  Roar.

(Much missing from all parties here....)

On the rogue's next turn

After the fighter's crit, so it doesn't matter that he's gone.  

They divvied up their loot and asked when we were playing again.  Success.

TL;DR (haiku):  Rogue is quite clumsy / The fighter crits on Black Fang / Cleric shakes her head.

We ran into some scouts.  Our Strix fighter wiped one out in the first round

And so our DM threw a squad of 6 goblins.  On stilts.  We all agreed that this was probably the most logical course of action for a goblin.  These goblins were actually able to move fairly well on stilts, still out of their reach, and the stilts were actually tall enough that they couldn't attack our groud-based party members either.  That and we'd usually just break the stilts out from under them.  Half of them tried to run away from us after the fight started going poorly (almost immediately).  They didn't make it far though, because they were still on stilts.  Basically, it was one of the easiest encounters ever, but also probably one of the most hilariously fun and memorable encounters I've ever had.

1366626470.0,1cuttj,I killed my first PC today. Full story included.,Nemesis0320,60,7,19,"I had my first actual character death happen to me while DMing. It happened during a side quest I came up with almost on the spot because a player couldn't show up at the last minute. It started off with me asking the players what they wanted to do

One of my players comes from a 'town' of arctic nomads. One day as a child she went off to explore a cave she had found while playing at the outskirts of the makeshift settlement. She came back and found that the pack had been slaughtered by a group of orcs. She did what she could to honor her parents, she grabbed a pack and placed what she thought she'd need to survive and went off. As she searched what remained of her people, she discovered that a few of the orcs had fallen when her tribe fought to save their lives. Along with the supplies, she armed herself with their orcich axes, and a new found hatred of the race. She couldn't carry the beat-up breastplates they still had on but she wanted ""something to help return the favor."" (her words)

Anyways, and the half-elf monk that they started adventuring with was embracing his old age, but the old wizard who was with them from the beginning of their journey had passed away due to old age. The player was okay with this, and asked if he could mix his character up a bit. I played it off at though his greatest disciple idolized the man, and wanted to experience first hand the lifestyle he lived. This was pretty much my way of letting the guy play the same type of character without losing a level due to death. He didn't have all the same spells, but the ones he used most often were still there, so he was fine with it.

The elf was the one who was not present for this session, and the now very old woman who was feeling the fatigue of age on her body. Having the death of an old friend fresh on her mind, she started thinking that death is nothing to be afraid of, but she didn't want to pass without paying her tribal resting place a visit. The savant was ecstatic to go, and the monk preached some business about balance through atonement, so the group was off.

A few days worth of travel later, but he turned and pointed towards a merging point of two sheets of ice. The players missed it with their first check, but further investigation led to finding a path with bones laid down ceremonially along the makeshift walls. ""I am above killing a child, but the rest of his tribe will not fare so well. Let the kid move on as though we were never here."" She said to the group once they were out of earshout.

As they adventured down they came across a cave. At the other end of the cave was a round setting where the orcs had made their home. ""Empty torch holders surround the areas in between tents made from what looks like dire wolf pelts with fur as white as the snow. In the middle of the little grotto is an extinguished fireplace, beat up artifacts that look as though they belonged from these parts. They explored the camp and found only the remains of food that looks as though it had been sitting out for quite some time. The players came across the conclusion that the camp had been abandoned some time ago and planned on going back to see if the kid had stayed where he was.

As they turned back to enter the cave, he vanished into thin air. From the pile of bones, behind the players, a creature burst into the air. ""The creature before you appears to have the rough etymology of an orc, although his head looks more as though it were a frost elk. Though much of his skin appears to have rotted off, you can notice patches of hairy or tattooed flesh amongst the exposed mass of tendon and muscle. Where his feet would be, only exposed tibia and fibula remain, bone shaking howl. Make a wills save.""

The players started combat, so he started by setting the Wendigo ablaze. This took care of its Regeneration, but then my players could not hit something to save their lives, pun intended. I did not think that the -2 from being shaken would make a difference. After a few rounds, I made the Wendigo scream again. I was expecting that, with the -2 to saves, they would fail the saves again. To my surprise, the monk and sorcerer rolled 4's for how long they had to flee. Our fighter crit her save

The player said that he was fine with it if his character died, they had been taking out things with higher CR's all campaign, so when I thought of this I figured they'd plow through it with just a bit of challenge. I just wanted to have your feedback as to how I did. For about 40 minutes of planning, what could I have done better? What did you like about it? If your feeling up to it, tell me how your first experience killing a PC went (note that I do not consider the death of the Wizard a 'death' that I was responsible for.)

Then, fast forward, and Wizard decides to not renew Dungeon and Dragon, their monthly RPG magazines then published by - Paizo Publishing.  Shortly after that, Paizo announces it will release Pathfinder- an extension of the 3.5 ruleset, there would be no Pathfinder

Our mission was basically to pay off our land debt so a trading company doesn't take our home. Pretty simple which lead to some pretty humorous moments. It started off with us thinking of a way to get money. So we headed off to the local tavern known as The Rusty Pipe. In there we met a dwarf who was seduced and charmed by a woman which destroyed his marriage. She ended up taking an amulet from the dwarf which he wanted back. So off we went.

I had the bright idea to set up an ambush. Have one of us pose as someone she would prey on while the others hang back and prepare for the fight. Nephelem (I think that's how it's spelled) was our lucky bait. We found her, so he promptly agreed and dropped his pants. ""No you dipshit!"" The woman yelled. ""Your bag!"" That's when we came into the alley only to see Neph on his knees in front of this woman with his pants around his ankles and a dagger to his throat. (Not a very pretty sight, but amusing) She fled into the sewers and we followed.

Down there we fought a group of kobolds. One was killed by a fireball which promptly turned into, but I can't.) This is where I got my first kill. Pretty much sliced a kobold right in half with my scythe. I felt good about that. Another was pinned to the wall with an arrow and we captured the last one.

When he gets into melee range

From Core
&gt; Starting a bardic performance is a standard action, paralyzed, stunned, knocked unconscious, or otherwise prevented from taking a free action to maintain it each round.** A bard cannot have more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

From this, like attacking. 

When he downs an opponent

But wait! The Urban Barbarian Archetype!

When an urban barbarian rages, or Constitution. This bonus increases to +6 when she gains greater rage and +8 when she gains mighty rage. She may apply the full bonus to one ability score or may split the bonus between several scores in increments of +2. When using a controlled rage, an urban barbarian gains no bonus on Will saves, takes no penalties to AC, **and can still use Intelligence-, Dexterity-, and Charisma-based skills**.

**Question**

The big opening mission is to reclaim a keep that has been taken over by orcs.  The players decided to infiltrate the keep, and the one after that was even worse -- multiple orcs escaped, shouting and screaming as they fled.  The players were pissed about that, saying, ""Well there goes the element of surprise.""  So the PCs ran down some stairs to the dungeons below, found a room and barred the door.  I assumed they would prepare for the fight to come to them.  Instead, they went to sleep

First question: how stupid is that?  I mean that seriously

*My* thinking for the orcs went like this.  Assume you are the leader of 26 angry orcs and you just got news that the keep was infiltrated and 10 of your soldiers had been killed.  A couple of the keep rooms were now awash in orc blood &amp; body parts.  What would you do?  (Again

I felt it made good sense for the leader &amp; his 16 survivors to gather up arms, but it's barred and there is no answer from the guard who is supposed to be in there.  They grab torches &amp; the oil they'd been saving for pouring over the keep walls, grab a tree trunk to use as a battering ram, and they burst that door open and light up everything inside that isn't an orc.

Doesn't that make sense?

My players, they cannot conceive of how it makes sense at *all* for them to be attacked.  They're like, ""What, did the orcs magically *know* to come to our room?  Why would they do that?  Are they *metagaming* orcs?""

I'm so stumped by that response that I honestly couldn't respond to it.  So that's my final question: does that player response make any sense at all?  I'm currently assuming that it's just whining.  However if you guys honestly think my approach was unfair, and we ended the game day with all of them running from the fight.  1 guy in particular probably will die, but 2 are already out of the dungeon and running.

**Declaration**

Orcs are *way* meaner in Pathfinder.  The new ""ferocity"" ability essentially gives them 12 extra hit points, they only gain the ""staggered"" condition, but not the disabled condition (which everyone else gets at 0 HP).  So this means that if an orc is at -1 HP, and uses a standard action to swing a sword at an enemy, the orc does not take 1 HP of damage and go unconscious (as anyone with the disabled condition would).  Instead, it remains at -1 HP.  (I'm aware of the -1 HP stabilization roll, but the *additional* damage from exerting yourself doesn't apply to orcs.)  This means that orcs who go into negative hit points stay up and keep hitting much longer than expected.  These changes make a difference.  Seriously,,1373966392.0,t3_1ic69k

Background:

The PCs are going into a Jungle to ""Rescue"" a Nobleman's son from a Coven of witches, the Noble does not trust him to bring his son back alive, and would like the players to accompany him. Inquisitors tend to be anti-magic in this world, but turns out the NPC they're traveling with is a pretty cool guy.

The PCs + NPC go to a witch camp, hoping to find a way to convince the son to leave in the morning.

The PCs are: A Gunslinger, and a Rogue.

The buildup:

When they wake up, he looks at them, and whispers 'Go'. They do not. The witch starts using her hair (witch hair FTW) to torture the Inquisitor, she breaks both of his arms so that him hanging from the tree becomes especially painful.

Meanwhile, and a few other spellcasters standing off to the side. The rogue hides in the brush, the Oracle goes and tries to talk to them, trying to convince the son to go back to his father. The conversation gets heated quickly. The Oracle casts Hold Person on the Nobleman's Son and the Rogue immediately drags the body into the brush without anyone noticing (ridiculous stealth checks). In response, the mages cast web on the oracle, light the web on fire, and then summon spiders to crawl along the burning web. They then realize that the Noble-kid's body is gone and start searching the brush for it.

Action:

What follows is a two-fold battle.

The Magus proceeds to cast spark on the witch's hair. It lights, and close enough between two trees, that it functions. The only one not affected is the head witch, and those of them that make their reflex saves. The Magus, having made his weapon flaming, then uses spell combat to light the web by striking it. The Magus and Gunslinger are now fighting nine witches, some of whom are in a burning web.

Meanwhile, and an Orc Scarred Witch Doctor.

Back at the tree of Inquisitor burning:

The Gunslinger, he ends up in a line from the furious head witch, who blasts him with a lightning bolt. Right after she does that, The Gunslinger draws her musket and shoots her, she's still not dead. The Inquisitor, despite the fact that he has broken arms, tackles her to the ground and places his weight on top of her so that her face is pressed against the burning web, the Inquisitor is now in a Burning web with broken arms and is about to die. I was willing to accept that, and then yank him out of the fire"".

To which I said ""Fuck yes.""

Meanwhile, however, it's a scarred witchdoctor, as as we know, they have nothing if not HP. They do a good amount of damage and its a well-planned sneak attack, but it's still 2 versus 4. The Sorceress takes to the air and starts raining scorching ray on them. Meanwhile the two Wizards provide support and the Witchdoctor provides debuffs. They're in major trouble. Still, they manage to take down a Wizard with a well-used 'Inflict moderate wounds' (Never considered that that could be so effective).

Meanwhile, with the damage they've already taken from the burning web, die outirght. But not enough. The Gunslinger jumps down to the ground next to the Inquisitor she saved, but gets barraged with magic missiles and knocked down to -7. The Inquisitor Proceeds to pick her up, with his broken arms (I rolled to see if he could do this) and carry her into the treeline, while he himself is being barraged with magic missiles. The Magus's rolling ball of fire kills the other mages, meaning that he has just single-handedly killed 16 mages.

The Magus (who has been getting seriously lucky this fight) runs for the other battle.

Meanwhile, and who can use a Greataxe. The Oracle uses Hold Person on the Sorceress, who is still flying, and she hits the ground hard. The other wizard is sneak attacked to death, but immediately afterward The rogue is knocked down to -5 by the Orc. Then the Magus shows up. He hits the Orc with a Shocking Grasp weapon attack. The Orc steps back, and uses hold person on the Magus, completely disabling him

The group has killed almost the entire coven of witches, with 1/4 his health. Keep in mind, too, that he was also the only one left *standing.*

What made this amazing was I planned for the PCs to either choose to save their Inquisitor companion and let their quarry go

Though barely.

1367850863.0,1dskyn,Glitterdust - your interpretation please!,Multitaskingish,45,10,49,"Hey all! I spotted the post on grease and thought it'd be interesting to bring this one up. I've always interpreted [Glitterdust](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/glitterdust.html#_glitterdust) in one way but my DM has always viewed it another. Both seem feasible and so he's said we can do either interpretation as long as I claim it first (best of both worlds really!).

So first
&gt;**Glitterdust**  
&gt;School conjuration (creation); Level bard 2
&gt; Casting Time: 1 standard action  
&gt; Components: V
&gt; Range: medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)  
&gt; Area: creatures and objects within 10-ft.-radius spread  
&gt; Duration: 1 round/level  
&gt; Save: Will negates (blinding only); SR no  

&gt; A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area
&gt; Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Stealth checks.  

I've always imagined this as dust that is summoned in that area which drifts down to blanket everything within the 10ft radius circle. Once it's settled that's it, they'll still be covered in sticky glitter. If they try and stealth or go invisible then they get the -40 to stealth even if they are nowhere near the original radius of effect and they can no longer be blinded once they've passed their will save. On the other hand, people that walk through the area afterwards aren't affected as the glitter is now on the floor and has settled.  

My DM however, even if they've previously passed a save. Similarly, anyone invisible or stealthy that enters the area is instantly outlined in dust. However if you leave the area then you are no-longer covered in glitter and you are unaffected by blindness as the dust doesn't settle on you, preferring to stay in the cloud.  

So my interpretation is more useful for stealth/invis breaking and for blinding someone that is moving around. The DM's version is better for more static fights as it can continually blind and reveal anyone in an area

Does anyone have a preffered interpretation of the rules? Or do Paizo go into more detail anywhere as to exactly how this works? Or do you simply have a better way to read it? I'd definitely be interested to hear opinions on this.

Thanks!

**If vaccines solve everything

It would be a terrible strategy to sit around waiting for allies to take damage, you people would probably load up Pez dispensers with penicillin and hand them out to trick-or-treaters on Halloween).  

A good support cleric often starts the fight with buffs or debuffs. Personally I prefer buffs because Bless is guaranteed to work, but the wizard probably does them better, at least at low levels. If you're out of things to do and/or playing CoDzilla, you could go whack something with a mace. But *sooner or later*, something is going to get through. Sometimes you can afford to ignore the wizard's arterial bleeding and keep fighting, but sometimes you can't. If your enemies are smart, they'll focus fire on the PC who is most important to winning the encounter. If the dying player is better suited to winning this encounter

**Good healing is cheap**

All it takes to heal well as a positive energy cleric is a single feat (selective channeling) and 12-14 charisma. Everything else is just icing on the cake--you don't need to pick domains for it, or waste feat slots beyond the first level. 

I often see the complaint that it's just spending an action to rewind the opponent's action. That does sound like a bad deal. The output of magical healing is probably not going to exceed the damage capacity of a level-appropriate enemy--in fact the healing may be less. But I think this wisdom is somewhat of a hold-over from D&amp;D 3.5, then keeping them on their feet for just one more round can enable that final push that takes the battle from a close call to just a matter of mopping up.

There are some easy tricks to make healing more effective too. Do enemies consistently see your armor and decide to go after the squishy rogue instead? Shield Other is a godsend spell in these cases because you can spread out the damage and channel energy effectively heals twice as much when it's divided between two people, then that heal just reversed 1.5 turns worth of work, rather than 1.0 turns.

**In conclusion**

Healing during combat is not the be-all-and-end-all of Pathfinder power playing practices, then healing won't be as good for you (and I'm not even going to get into the positive/negative energy debate, other than to repeat that I would rather have a guaranteed effect than one that allows a saving throw). But you can do some decent, timely healing as a cleric with very little specialization, and if you have allies worth their salt, then keeping them up is probably a good investment, unless you have another action up your sleeve that will single-handedly finish the encounter.

We've been playing Carrion Crown. Due to real life issues, a Monk, and Inquisitor, a Paladin, and a Rogue. Lots of buff and healing, not much in the way of Arcane ""blast"" power -- and no one really well-positioned for item creation feats.

Although treasure has been pouring in at the module-prescribed rate

In the second book the GM let us ""commission"" a Handy Haversack (one of my favourite items), and there had been enough +1 things laying around to keep us amused, for the most part. After all, the GM is the GM, right?

The second book passed, we know have a clean-up crew of Dwarven apprentices (their master being killed due to our error in judgement and degree of danger) who we give the ""Vendor Trash"" to. They carry it to market towns, and pocket a commission, and save us time that we haven't been allowed.

However this week we raced pell-mell to the fourth adventure. Many of us are 9th lvl (those trailing behind have missed a number of sessions, but only by a session or two). However -- we're still armed with a collection of +1 items and a smattering of +2's -- often the ones we found, not the ones we desired. And although we have a very large ""bank account"" that closely approximates wealth by level -- we have no time to actually do anything with it.

So I led a mutiny of sorts. I said we needed to stop and ""re-spec"" -- I'm a Monk with a magic dagger I mostly don't need and a pair of +1 bracers -- we have ""tanks"" with armour that is neither magical nor masterwork. 

If this was a homebrew campaign things wouldn't have mattered so much. But it isn't. We're running an Adventure Path

I really do feel bad for what followed. Most of us have about 20, because we're not moving from ""Big City"" until we do. 

The GM was pretty upset

My counter was that each and every encounter in the third book was wiping us out. We had more trips to negative hit-points than trips to the bathroom. most of the tough fights saw two, waiting for post-fight healing. The Monk (me) is the only character with the ability to reliably strike past the damage resistance that has become ubiquitous. we were under-geared, thus out of our league. And our original mission from the first book was well and truly dispatched -- maybe it was time some other adventurers stepped forward and  saved the damn world, because we weren't going to cut it.

We hashed it out for about an hour. For the most part we stayed pretty calm

However,000gp.

It is pretty clear, and going completely Monty Haul. He's discussed ""ret-conning"" the last session with me, and is pretty upset that the group ""mutinied"" and that I (an old and dear friend) was the ring-leader for said mutiny. And that makes me feel bad -- after all, I don't want to bully my friends. I'd just like our group to have a fair chance at success.

I think I've got him calmed down, as we did take a lot of time to craft those items, and toss us in over our heads into the fifth book.

evolved familiar: Reach (his horns now have a 10 foot reach)

Power Attack: Since familiars use their master's BAB... This is gonna get fun!

The thing to keep in mind is that a familiar uses his Master's base attack bonus and hit dice (His hp are always half of the master's rounded down). So since our rough rider/witch has about 96 HP, +3 to his AC and +2 to his saves (This will go to +4, +3 at 11th, and continue increasing every 4 levels). Him and the rider ALSO each get a +1 to attack and damage whenever the rider is mounted on War-Goat (This will increase to +2 at 10th, and every 4 levels after).

In this game, in exchange for a soul.

He summoned the devil on her behalf while she was dying (from a hag's curse) and he offered to save her in exchange for her soul once she died.

The problem is that because this is a fallen world with almost no schools

The contract did spell out that she would belong to him in perpetuity

While she's dead, open the ancient city of the dwarves, find all sorts of neat stuff.

While this is happening, particularly from powerful good individuals, but anyone really, the more power he'll have.

He convinces the dwarven queen to give up her soul to speak to her dead husband (a former party member who also died) one last time, by him) he convinces her that the devils he is in contact with are actually gods, to be worshipped. (he's got a crazy diplomacy score)

While we are away, with the sorcerer acting as intermediary, their voice on earth and prophet. The contract basically forms a new religion, spelling out the 'Lawful Evil' precepts of the faith. (which is a harsh, medieval sort of 'non-believers can be tolerated as guests, but every effort should be made to convert them to the faith and sign the contract' religion)

So when we return, and the queen is eating out of his hand (non literally, but you know)

At about the same time this is all happening, acquiring the half-celestial template and retraining her bard levels into levels of a CG paladin variant (Paladin of Freedom) that is basically in all mechanical aspects the same as a paladin.

She returns to the city, I didn't actually push for it at all). She's a renegade from heaven and probably shouldn't come too close to any angelic types.

She doesn't really 'know' what devils are either, so naturally, she tried to convince everyone to not sign. (the dwarves all had, but at this point, the sorcerer was pushing for the party to sign also)

To complicate this

Hardly anyone really listened to her

Anyway, what role is the Fallen angel who tried to tempt people away from the Gods and spoke against their will likely to have in the mythology?

Anyway, she's mostly going to try to watch over her friends and keep them safe, while waiting for her Ray Patterson moment.

We haven't played a table top RPG (D&amp;D, play a lot of video games, and read a review about how amazing Pathfinder was so picked up my Beginners Box from Amazon, and started reading. I put roughly 15 hours into reading, forums, the Black Fang starter dungeon research, DL'ed apps to help keep track of modifiers, printed character sheets, and research later. I also encouraged my son and wife to be creative. Don't just walk into a room, try to put the enemy between you and your ally as to gain Flanking

My first mistake (perhaps) was not using the pre-built characters that came with the Beginners Box. Since the app I downloaded (Hero Lab) wouldn't let a Beginner's Box character be in the same portfolio as a normal Pathfinders character

The very first area we are in, go slowly into the room and look for enemies and report back... Of course the Beginners Box simply says something to the affect of ""After the players all take a round, goblins burst through the curtain and attack"". So 30 seconds into our game, I don't know WTF to do. Pulling something straight out of my ass like a magician, I say ""your frog companion can't speak / communicate with you, so wouldn't be able to tell you what was in there in the first place"" and we move on avoiding disaster.

This was the start of a string of ""what if's"" I could barely keep up with. ""In one round can I drop my bow, but that seems like a shit ton of dmg for a level 1 frog considering we are all hitting for like 1d6'ish"". ""Can I use Spellcraft the same as detect magic to identify this magical gem?"" ""What is ""melee touch and ranged touch"" that's listed here under my weapon name mean""? ""I use produce flame to shoot a fireball at the goblin. However the description I found on d20pfsrd.com was so fucking confusing I have really no clue how the spell works whatsoever. ""My frog uses Pull with his tongue, does that do damage? And does it pull the enemy to me or leave him 3 squares away?"" ""WTF is critical threat, is that the same as critical hit adding 2x dmg to your dmg roll?"" ""Can my frog put on this ring?"".

Fuck, and stressed. I jotted down my questions (listed above) and said I would look into it after our session, and well, here I am... I have PDF's for nearly all rules, advanced, beginner, websites, forums.... and I still find that being brand new to this game may be more than I can handle. I fly airplanes

In 4 1/2 hours we were able to get 3 rooms into the beginners box adventure. My wife had 2 shots of vodka and a Mojito

Could anyone clarify those rules above, and I just took notes to look up answers later. However some things I don't even know WHAT to look up... So I almost have to tell them to do something else, which takes away from their fun. I must be over analyzing this, and putting to much thought into our first session of table top gaming ever, but 15 hours of research prior to game play, to make it (barely) through 3 rooms seemed so extremely time consuming.

On a closing note, and hacking goblin's heads off, we were having an absolute BLAST. I haven't seen my son smile like that in a long time, and even my wife admitted when I wasn't staring at 3 PDF's, a forum, and 2 manuals for 30 minutes at a time, she was having fun as well. I really want to stick with this and be successful but am feeling maybe we aren't cut out for it.

The interesting thing will be the players don't get to know everything about the characters before they choose them. Only very basic or general information will be given. This is partially to keep the players in the dark about what they are choosing before they choose it

You see, but each one will be trying to complete their end goal, and I doubt very much that they'd want everyone else to know something like ""I want to obliterate the sun and plunge the world into darkness"" or ""I want to corrupt the 5 major religions and have them turn all worship over to _____.""

Furhtermore, or have some other template applied to it. This information won't be available to the players when they're deciding what character they want to play. Instead, they'll get info like ""This character will tend towards melee combat, but will also be very good at social abilities"" or ""This character will kind of suck at any challenge, but will be a bit crazy and I guarantee you'll have fun with it"" with the point being to let them have a generally vague idea of what they're getting into. Once they get the character, though, they get all knowledge of it.

FURTHER furthermore, another character might have almost no backstory but some loose associations with other characters. Oh that reminds me! Whatever characters the players don't select will still be around, doing exactly what they would want to do had they been chosen as PC's.

Okay, ""hey, yeah! This isn't really such a bad thing to do... I mean he's not REALLY that bad!"" until a bit down the road, they realize they've made the starting of Hitler and the Holocaust, or racism, or whatever.

SO. With literally anything on the table, what are some really interesting mash-ups of a character's basic build that works well with an end-goal? For instance, the vampire who wants to obliterate the sun... The necromancer who wants to bring back his dead wife from Hell at any cost... The young revolutionary who starts Communism and then becomes the dictator of it.

For class

Human is the ideal race choice as well

Initially, though, as I'll explain below.

Level breakdown is as follows:

**Level 1**

* *Human Feat* Point-Blank Shot
* *Level 1 Feat* Precise Shot
* *Fighter Feat* Weapon Focus (longbow)

**Level 2**

* *Fighter Feat* Rapid Shot

**Level 3**

* *Level 3 Feat* Dodge
* *Trick Shot* Disarm; useful for knocking those pesky wands/rods/staves out of casters' hands

**Level 4**

* *Fighter Feat* Mobility
* *+1 Dexterity*

**Level 5**

* *Level 5 Feat* Combat Reflexes

**Level 6**

* *Fighter Feat* Snap Shot; At this point, thanks to taking Combat Reflexes at the previous level, he can do this multiple times in a round.

**Level 7**

* *Level 7 Feat* Disruptive; The DC for casting defensively within 5ft. of the archer is now increased by +4.
* *Trick Shot* Feint

**Level 8**

* *Fighter Feat* Combat Patrol; With this feat, firing a ranged weapon, etc within 10 ft. of him provokes an AoO when he takes this action, and the archer doesn't have to move to make the attack.
* *+1 Dexterity*

**Level 9**

* *Level 9 Feat* Improved Snap Shot; The archer now passively threatens an area of 15 ft. around him
* *Safe Shot* The archer can now fire indiscriminately without worrying about provoking attacks at all.

**Level 10**

* *Fighter Feat* Spellbreaker; If a caster fails his defensive casting check within 15 ft. of the archer

**Level 11**

* *Level 11 Feat* Disrupting Shot; The check to avoid losing a spell on damage is now increased by +4 if the damage was a result of the archer readying an action.
* *Trick Shot* Grapple; If a caster is successfully grappled by an arrow

**Level 12**

* *Fighter Feat* Greater Snap Shot
* *+1 Dexterity*

**Level 13**

* *Level 13 Feat* Pin Down; Any opponent within 15/25 ft. now provokes on withdraw or 5 ft. step

**Level 14**

* *Fighter Feat* Teleport Tactician; anyone teleporting within 15/25 ft. of the archer now provokes.

**Level 15**

* *Level 15 Feat* Vital Strike; Vital Strike is a standard action
* Combat Patrol improves to +15 ft.
* *Trick Shot* Sunder or Bull Rush; I don't know which would be better.

I'm not sure what to pick yet for levels 16+



When played as I envision (readying actions to fire at casters, if starting with an 18 Dexterity, by level 20 the archer will be able to take up to 6 AoOs per round, and that can probably add up pretty fast.

We were early in our campaign, which we accidentally succeeded in doing. We found her bound and gagged inside a cave surrounded by four Tiefling Rouges, and battle was soon joined. Thanks to some quick thinking, and a few lucky rolls, we quickly dispatched three of the four Tieflings, and we had the last one surrounded. Now here is where the magic started:

DM: ""The Tiefling realizes he is screwed

Cleric: ""Wait

DM: ""He saw what you did to his friends

Fighter: ""Ah man

Me: ""...Does a Coup de grâce provoke? That provokes

Laughter around the table.

""No

DM: ""Wat. Why?""

Me: ""Non-lethal

DM: ""Ok, so I really doubt...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20.

DM: ""God

I roll again, with the Tiefling having 14 AC, as we had learned earlier.

DM: Darn

Fighter: ""No no

DM: ""That still gives him 13

Fighter: ""Bless."" The DM had apparently forgotten the Bless spell cast at the beginning of the fight

DM: ""Fine, so I doubt-""

Me: ""8. Max damage

DM: ""...I hate all of you.""

So we bound up the Tiefling with the ropes from the princess

DM: ""Alright, there are Tiefling-eating bears in these woods...""

clack clack clack

Natural 20 from the Fighter.(We had a home-rule that a natural 20 meant automatic success on skill checks

The DM was silent for a second

Me: ""I check the Tieflings mouth.""

DM: ""What? Why?""

Me: ""The tiefling just bit his own tongue off so we can't take him alive

The DM was silent. That was in fact exactly what had just happened.

After a quick healing from our Cleric (We decided that we shoved the tongue back in the mouth and healed the wound) the party realized we had a few options here: We could either make a contraption of a gag so that the Tiefling couldn't bite his tongue but could still breathe; we could have the cleric walk behind him constantly casting Cure Minor Wounds (in Pathfinder level 0 spells can be cast as often as you like) so he couldn't bite through his tongue again

Cleric: ""We are next to a river

DM: ""Yeah

Cleric: ""Are there reeds growing there?""

DM: Yeah

Cleric: We could preform a tracheotomy! That way

The DM was aghast

And thus ended the one and only story of competency that our group had.

After careful thought I decided I couldn't simply not mention anything or kick him out without a warning. Part of me wants to. He does make things difficult for me. At the same time a ""rule-lawyer"" can be a boon if they can offer rule assistance in a helpful way. Additionally... I think it just is a dick move to kick someone out of a group without a polite conversation.

With this in mind I crafted this message:
&gt;
Hey. Yeah we plan on starting up again this Saturday at 1pm. Before we get you started though there are two things you should know.
&gt;
1) After last session most of the people came to me to tell me they were unhappy about the last session. They felt you monopolized the majority of the time. Which is true. This is a team game that deals with social interaction and thus you shouldn't of allowed yourself to monopolize DM time to your character so much.
&gt;
This is not to say that I am without fault. I let you play a creature I wasn't comfortable with (my mistake). I let you monopolize my time when you only constituted 1/5 of the total player amount (my mistake). In retrospect I should of give you 3 rounds of action in which I gave obvious signs of doom approaching and then simply killed your character. It simply wasn't fair to rest of the party.
&gt;
2) Rules mania. Another part that makes the game less enjoyable is the adherence to the rules. I've read the book front to cover, though I try. It makes the game less enjoyable for all when I get bogged down looking up rules since you seem to want to challenge my ruling every other turn.
&gt;
Just a few things to point out about this. I personally prefer to follow the rules, have a page number to turn to. Don't bog the game down in an endless cycle of rule look up. In fact I feel the best way to handle such a case would be to simply do something else for your turn and then look it up in the book. Then simply hand me the book, pointing out where the ruling is. This takes less time away from others while still helping me out with the rules.
&gt;
The second point to make about rules is that the GM/DM is the final arbiter of the rules and may throw anything out. I know you are aware of this. I also don't wish to make the rules so arbitrary that the rule books have no meaning. I also have no problem simply not using a rule that makes zero sense to me(though this happens rarely). And I also don't mind waving a rule aside for something that might be fun for a player. The point I want to make is that the rules are not supreme. It is okay to relax on them a bit. I still would like your help (in the method I mentioned) on the rules but I simply will not be stopping play every turn anymore.
&gt;
To end this... I know this sounds like an attack of some sort so I am going to explicitly say that I am NOT trying to attack you. My job as DM is try to make it so everyone can have fun
&gt;
I understand if you feel ""picked on"" to some aspect or if you simply don't like the way I DM to the point you would rather not play than change your style of play slightly. If you do still want to play
&gt;
-Robert



After about a day I got a response:
&gt;
i understand a lot of what you said.
i was also frustrated with how last session turned out, and literally(or is it figurative if in game?) banging my head ageist a stone wall.
long-term separation of a single party member just isn't practical play.
i thought about this awhile
But anyway
i've said this before
i am bad at doing that in most games
&gt;

At this juncture I think I am fine with teh current turn of events. If a game bombs again because of him I can say I at least tried. If he shapes up he can become helpful to me as a GM.

This I plan to put at as a topic on each of my Pathfinder campaigns to clarify how I think. Since you joined the game in the first place it is not required reading but I find it interesting as an explanation to keep me and the players on the same page. 

Here I want to explain why I'm using Pathfinder almost exclusively in list form. The list is not in a particular order as I write this. I write each subject as it comes to me. 



**1)Pathfinder is Popular**


Not to say that I am one to just go with the flow and stick with the mainstream, even if the materials were not built for Pathfinder specifically. There is a significant amount of digital resources that support Pathfinder. There are also fewer things you have to teach, in that even if its just basic information people already have concepts of things like wizards, rogues and elves. Even if your only experience in roleplaying is Final Fantasy, you still know that with too little HP you die. 


**2) Pathfinder is Crunchy**


What I mean by 'crunchy' is that it has a ton of rules. Now this is the point where a lot of people would disagree favoring games that are far less complicated. At that I would say that there isn't a wrong answer for the complex vs rules light debate. 


But there are particular reasons why I mostly use a crunchy system like Pathfinder


**3) Pathfinder is Complicated**


This seems like a reiteration of my previous point and an argument against the system in general with but hear me out. I play Magic the Gathering, how they like to play, what options they choose and what strategies they value. I see a lot of similarities and the same kind of fun in roleplaying games with a lot of options like Pathfinder. This does have the inherent flaw that it is very easy to make an ineffective character much like how you can make a failing deck, but on the other side of the coin you a character has a very personal flavor to it. You can make a character that is an insanely goofy build or you could min-max for efficiency. Some see this as making character building a chore while I see it as artistically crafting your character. A rules light system does give you the same if not more freedom to make the character you want but I feel like the restrictions involved in the rules gives a bit of challenge that really makes he character your build giving character creation a more 'game-like' aspect as opposed to a 'toy-like' aspect.


**4)Pathfinder is Diverse.**

 

Looking at Paizo's Golarion setting it's easy to see that they wanted to fit in a little bit of everything. The hardcover books imply this as well; Pathfinder is a game that's easy to homebrew because you can do virtually anything you want within the realm of high fantasy. It's easy to see where to cut classes or feats to mold the game more to your setting and it's easy to get third party material to get the game to do what you want. I've played a lot of indie RPGs that were too setting specific for my tastes and while any system can be tweaked a lot of Pathfinder rules supports what I want to do without limiting too many options for the players. Not only that, and even fantasy science fiction in Pathfinder, sometimes even in the same setting. 


**5)Pathfinder is Free**



I have a copy of each of the hard copy core books with the exception of Bestiary 2 and 3. I've bought Pathfinder Minis and playmats. I have not spent more on a single game and each new material is incredibly useful. But the fact that the rules are free online is incredibly useful for players who don't have all that stuff, and I've been thankful for the times I had access to the books before I was able to buy the books.",,False,self,t5_2trms,1366069934.0,,

Can I get a shout-out from the people who sympathize with this or is pretty much everyone a power-gamer these days?

Mechanically, still have diehard, although now by a revelation, still roll multiple times for initiative [tactics subdomain vs War Sight.)  For the next five sessions, I get to tinker with him until I come up with something that fits.

Tuntus' goal is to get into Gorum's afterlife.  (Initially the flavor was he thought he was already dead, food, and drink, like Valhalla but with more Orcs.  MY goal is to get him as close to death as possible with each (serious) fight such that his name changes.  (At the DM's discretion.)  TUNTUS wants to die in battle.  I THE PLAYER want him not to die.  

In the last session (his debut as an Oracle) he got down to EXACTLY his con score below 0.  I spent a Hero point and a teammate did as well to instead have him at just 1 above dead and stable (cheat death hero point ability.)  At that point the DM stated my name changed

SO on to the mechanical crux of why I'm posting this.  I have the Furious Focus feat.  I didn't use it once during the last session as I forgot I had it.  I figure if it's that forgettable and I'm still hitting I can skip it for something neater.  I'd like a flavorful feat to take its place.  The two I'm looking at are [Tenacious Surivor](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/arg-feats/tenacious-survivor-orc-half-orc) and [Deathless Initiate](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/feats/combat-feats/deathless-initiate-combat).  I may take both eventually.  If anyone has any other suggestions for a Valhalla seeking Orc-le, but the game will go to 20th so I'm not worried about missing anything.

Relevant Modifiers:  STR +6, CHA +6 (After enhancement bonuses.)

Current Feats:  Extra Rev, [Furious Focus], Extra Rev, Extend Spell.

1370119799.0,1fhd8v,I got Ultimate Campaign,Effervesser,43,10,28,"I got Ultimate Campaign and it is full of good stuff. I wanted to post my thoughts on it

Ch 1: Character Background

The first bit is explaining how to make a background for your character including different things to consider and detail when you're developing a backstory for yourself. Its really neat and explains the importance of things like family relationships, (including the old ones so you only have to look them up in one book) drawbacks, which grants you an additional trait, and Story feats. 

The traits are great and varied, probably due to them being too Golarion specific. 

The Drawbacks are fun. Obviously many of them suck but not enough to disable your character too much. 

The story feats are mostly 'meh' in power and awesome in flavor. I would seriously consider taking a story feat in place of two traits or making it an option for players. They are so interesting but I don't imagine too many people sacrificing feats in favor of a story feat. If I could take two traits and two drawbacks for a story feat I would. 

The most fun of the chapter is the Background Generator. You make different rolls to fill out your background and alignment. I spent a lot of time just rolling up characters and they more often than not come out very interesting. I even filled out missing background details for some of my current characters. The best part is that depending on how your background turns up it grants access or reccomends traits and story feats for you to take. I almost feel like this should be a requirement for the traits

Ch 2; Downtime

Chapter two is something I will likely never use. It gives you day jobs and establishments you own. Its interesting and satisfyingly complex but it somewhat feels like I'm playing business tycoon in between adventures. If your adventurers do want to own a bar or start a church or guild then it is invaluable. 

Ch 3; Campaign Systems

Many of these are hit or miss depending on what kind of game you're running but I guarantee that something is going to hit. It's basically optional rules for handling optional things like honor, exploration and relationships. Many of these thing appear in adventure paths and are expanded upon making them really useful. Some of them have less rules and more fluff to consider. 

Ch 4; Kingdoms and War

Another thing I'll never use. While this chapter presents a deep system for mass combat and kingdom building, turn Pathfinder from a heroic adventure game to playing Civilizations. The rules are almost like a new game itself, so much so that after reading the whole thing I'm tempted to run a campaign where we ditch the character sheets and just play a Pathfinder: Tactics, where instead of a party the players are an alliance of kingdoms. For playing a 'Civilizations V' campaign or Kingmaker type campaigns these rules are great, but they are not so useful for your typical murder-hobo. 

Overall I think this book is spectacular. I do have a few criticisms about whats NOT in it. 
Firstly we have a ton of new social systems and optional things to keep track of but none of the social systems have tracking sheets. Downtime, Exploration or Relationship sheet. I know I can make one on my own but I wanted one made for me. 
Also speaking of Relationships I really wish there was more crunch in there involving relationship's interactions with Diplomacy,False,self,t5_2trms,False,,,t3_1fhd8v
1366119800.0,1cgkee,The art of haggling,Micp,36,6,34,"So lately it seems to me like this subreddit has mostly been about asking questions

Many people have forgotten the art of haggling, considering the extra gear you can buy for those 10-20%

First of all: don't just say ""i roll diplomacy to haggle"". DM's hate that and you won't get anywhere with it. As with all skill rolls based on talking: TALK. If you do well your GM might even give you a bonus to the roll.

What should you then say?

* Oversell yourself: The gear I have is clearly extraordinary, remember how i saved the town last week? the only reason i'm selling this is because they had duplicates! Likewise be sure to notice every dent and scratch on the salesman's gear. the only reason you're actually buying it is because you need a replacement untill you can buy some proper gear.

* Mention competition: It's not like you HAVE to buy from this guy. If you don't like his prices you could just buy from the guy down the street. in fact you were just checking prices for comparison before going over to his place. No other vendors in the town? No problem

* Good relations: The vendor obviously want to be in good standing with you: everyone knows adventurers are loaded

* Friendship/flattery: You can't buy bread with happiness

There's probably more than this

EDIT: It seems that there isn't a codified table for haggling through diplomacy. I could have sworn i have seen one somewhere but i guess it must've been another system. That said i would still say haggling is a good idea, but of course - which i probably should have said from the beginning - it will only take you so far. The merchant is a merchant after all and the third time you come running and wanting discount he'll probably be sick of the sight of your face, and might even charge you extra. Such is life when you as a player want to make price a negotiable thing, not to mention a good GM will always find a way to make you regret it when you start abusing GM favors.",,False,self,1366131232.0,t3_1cgkee

Once I had a good photo of him, resizing the image, and washing it out.  In the case of the character here, I wanted the standie to end up as a medium sized creature standie.  Through trial and error with the shrinky dink paper, I'm found that a printed image width of about 2.5 inches comes out right, with the height a little over twice that.

Once sized correctly, so anything you print gets way darker once it shrinks.  Using a white background for the image makes this easy, as you can just adjust the opacity of the image layer over a background layer in photoshop or GIMP for a quick and easy faded image.

If you're careful to align your images on the sheet, following the directions that come with your shrinky dink paper.  If all goes well, you have tiny version in about two minutes.  

What makes this work is that the shrinky dink paper thickens as it shrinks, tough plastic, and will stand up to a lot of wear.

Anyway, who up until this point had been thought to be assisting the Abyss.  The party hacks its way through the demons, as well as some of the vault's traps and guardians.  They find that the mortal shell of the deity has been found by the BBEG and brought here, stored in an enchanted safe room.  They must enter one at a time, and roll a d100 to see what happens.  Paladin rolls a 98, is brought face to face with a magma dragon, who questions his loyalties.  Paladin answers that he is wholeheartedly devoted to his deity, and exits the room with him.  She's the trapped deity.  Finally

Sorcerer rolls his spellcraft, tells them to come and see what awaits them.  They look down a grate in the middle of the cavern, and see the Tarrasque in its slumber.  BBEG wizard is downright insane, and wants to wipe out everything, all for the sake of chaos.  They fight him, and bring him unconscious.  Party is fighting over who gets to finish him off, when the little girl walks up and snaps his neck.

Then shit hits the fan.  His ritual is disrupted, and it traps the players in a demiplane.  The Keketar tells the party there is only one way for them to escape, and they begin fervent discussion/arguments over what to do.  The alchemist wants to invoke Asmodeus' help, the paladin wants to stab himself with his Holy Avenger and use a holy relic within him to restore his deity, the sorcerer wants to bluff the Keketar into releasing the Tarrasque, and the rogue wants to fight the Keketar directly.  Eventually, the paladin gets sick of debating

So basically, but Asmodeus gives him use of his Ruby Rod.  The sorcerer is attempting to release the Tarrasque.  The rogue is trying to stop the sorcerer.  In the end, the alchemist uses the Rod to channel axiomatic power and vaporize the Keketar, vaporizing himself in the process, the paladin and his deity are whisked off to Heaven, and the sorcerer and rogue are trapped forever in the Vault with the Tarrasque.  Next semester we're starting a new campaign set 10 years later, where the entire world is feeling the effects of this session.  Since the deity was released, and the mortal races are fighting for their very existence.

My group just escaped from one plane, and they had some fun convincing a few wights that the ""living caster"" they heard shouts about is actually the other wight that was running away from them. One incredible bluff check later the group edged away as five wights beat up their wight friend. But I digress.

The roots of the incredible scene began as the party got captured and placed in the dungeons of the lich's castle. The group consisted of a female elf witch, and hid. The AT(Arcane Trickster) then snuck into the dungeon to rescue them.

Now, and I had a 30 Int, I would know that it's a bad idea to give adventurers any method of hiding magical daggers or tools on them. So, the AT sneaks into the dungeon, having previously acquired the team's gear, and gave them their clothes back. So they have to sneak out, which involve getting past a single wight guard.

To get past the guard, etc. The witch disguises herself as a wight, and pretends to be escorting the ""prisoner"" Duelist out of the cell. The AT goes invisible and does that thing that rogues do. The party then decides they want to confront the lich. Now remember, the Duelist has to be completely naked for all this, to keep up appearances.

The lich was intended as a villian that the party would have to group up to defeat, the witch fails to curse him, the AT fails to sneak up on him, and he succeeds in casting greater invisibility and summoning an elder earth elemental. It's at this point that the party decides (wisely) to run, and they do so by jumping out the window.

But they can't outrun a flying lich. So the witch and the AT

The session ended with a female halfing and a female elf flying through the air holding a completely naked male sylph as they try to flee an angry lich.

I'm currently commissioning the groups best artist to draw that scene.

Fun: The bag has a secondary ability that is hidden from the players


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anymug Cl(15th)

Description: The mugs cup is made out of a green hallowed out crystal pillar

Ability(s): This mug while susceptible to heat hotter then boiling water and very vulnerable to acid is able to create any non-magical liquid in existence. This ability can be used at will. 

Fun:The secret to this mug is that if you place a potion inside of it, adding a fresh potion to the mug will allow it to mimic that potion for the day. These potions act at ½ the effect(must drink two potions to achieve effects like Enlarge Person.) of the original and become inert when a player tries to sell them. 
(Also, but with my own flavor)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Springheel Boots Cl(7th)

Description: Plain leather boots with a bit more heel in them then most men are comfortable with

Ability(s): Allows the user to jump an extra 20ft weather its vertically or with a running start. 

Fun: My players have made great use of these boots even tho sometimes NPC's mistake the bard for a crossdresser.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pants of Ample Pockets Cl(9th)

Description: These brown pants look quite mundane from the outside

Ability(s): The pants come with a minimum of one pocket that functions as a bag of holding

Fun: These pants have been used to great comedic effect as well as allowing the players to think beyond


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Draconian Armor of Swift Girding Cl(7+AC Bonus)

Description: Armor befitting a dragon of standing

Ability(s): This armor jumps onto the dragon as a swift action when the command word is spoken and removes its self in a similar fashion. This also improves the Dragons tail attack damage by one step by adding a weapon to the end. The AC bonus varies. 

Fun: This was made for the Bards pet(?) silver dragon who was hurting a little when it came to AC (having only 19 AC while the average party member had 22+)


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Necklace of Fake Personality Cl(4th)

Description: A beautiful crystal pendant is inlaid with gold and silver and hung from a silken string.

Ability(s): Gives the user +4 to all Cha based skill checks.

Fun:The story behind this one is that when I was first getting into Pathfinder someone described that Cha score was related to how personable and pretty you were


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Rod of Aquatic Mastery Cl(16th)

Description: This rod is made from a solid orb of opal whose cracks shift around always forming images of waves crashing against a golden beach. The shaft is made from silver and gilded shells form the grip of this beautiful rod.

Ability(s): Passive: Gives the owner gills when they enter water deep enough to swim in. Also allows the owner to detect the presence of water within 30ft of her current position. 

Move Action: This ability allows the owner to grow flippers

Swift action: Three times per day the owner is able to cause a tendril of water to appear out of an appropriately sized pool of water

Full round Action: Once per day the owner of the rod can pull from any suitable source of water to encase a target in water, DC 25 reflex to escape from the water. 

Fun: Recently introduced this rod in my game and cant wait to see how players use it in upcoming fights.

A two-weapon rogue is a raging flurry of damage

A scorpion whip is a light one-handed weapon that, weapon proficiency (whip) and weapon proficiency (scorpion whip) is a little feat-expensive. You can pick up both with a level of bard AND a level of Calistra cleric, or try for an heirloom weapon.  You might also be able to argue that the light scorpion whip can be used with exotic weapon proficiency (whip) as a regular whip without the improved damage and armor ignorance.

However, and an eversmoking bottle, you’ll have the same amount of attacks as a shortsword two-weapon fighter, but you’d have 5-15 ft. reach, concealment vs. anyone 5 feet away, total concealment from anyone further than that, and ability to see through your own fog. Also, giving you the sneak attacks

1: Two-Weapon fighting (1d6 sneak attack)

1 (human): Weapon proficiency (whip)

2: Weapon Training (whip)

3: Whip Mastery (2d6 sneak attack)

4: Finesse Rogue

5: Combat Reflexes (3d6 sneak attack)

6: (combat trick)Agile Maneuvers (reasoning? Disarm and Trip from distance and concealment means no attacks of opportunity)

Dead stop. For an hour real time we just could not break the damn thing.  Very frustrating. 
Our GM prodded us on whereby we discovered an air vent leading to an underground library where we fought an animated chair(we could not defeat it due to time constrains) and discovered the pertinent documents relating to our quest.

1372036113.0,1gxuof,"Tonight in Skull and Shackles, my players did something crazy. They killed the Great White Whale, at level 5.",NatWilo,38,25

 As the title states, slamming itself down onto the middle deck of their ship, and capsizing it with a mighty CRACK! Nearly instantly, 19 crewmen were crushed to death under the massive bulk of the fifty-ton monstrosity. 

Needless to say, torn between wanting to spare them from what could very well be the death of the entire party, or holding true to the roll, and making them grit it out. I chose to grit it out. 

As the whale slides off the ship, most are nearly dead, (four of the five are in low single digit territory, two are at 1hp.) All are wounded. The Tengu rogue was belowdecks, and is the only one uninjured, and he starts to shout for all hands to shift to wereshark. He knows, like all the pirates, but they're weresharks

The Storm Druid, hurt, and scared, he shifts to hybrid form, and tries to gather all the remaining pirates that had been on deck to him. The Soulknife tries to attack the whale in the water, but is smacked hard by the whale's tail. It begins to look dire.

The Tengu Rogue, ready to fight to the death to save themselves. That's when it happens. The Druid casts Pup Shape, (from Ultimate Combat). Hilariously, he'd tried this earlier multiple times on numerous creatures it could not work on. I roll the whale's Fort-save, and stare, shocked, at the natural 1. I got a total of 22. Not the 23 needed to save. In stunned disbelief I describe the shockwave of water created by a **fifty-ton behemoth** suddenly turning into a dog-sized carp of a whale. 

But the fight is not over. No. The Sharks are in the water, they do not have to make a will save. All miss, save two of the pc's. The size of a dog it may be, and it might only have 1hd for the duration of the spell (five rounds) but it's still got a base 28AC, +4 because it just got shrunk. Two of the players manage to roll natural 20's to attack. The first bites, but does minimal damage, and it doesn't die. The second chomps down, killing a 225hp Great White Whale

The Pirates surge to the boat, but the whale is dead, and not quite that huge.) I pulled a dungeon crawl, complete with partially digested Grindylows out of my ass, that the party loved almost as much as the 'fight' with the Whale. In it some very nice loot was found. 

The party limped into port, while the ship gets fixed, they get their cut of the loot, and generally live up their new-found fame. ",,False,self,1372036428.0,t3_1gxuof

Lastly, but it feels like you're really battling monsters.

These are one trick ponies which leave your character grossly under prepared for the other important elements of tabletop gaming: the roleplaying, and you have nothing to fall back on.

Consider this process in reverse.  Create a character, some flaws, some layers.  Create this THEN add your gimmick.  Now you have something much more dynamic, something much more substantial to play with.  Now you are playing a character with a cool skillset, rather than a one note circus trick.  You do all those ""cool"" things that your gimmick vision allowed for AND you have someone who can interact significantly outside of combat, outside of that gimmick.

I expand upon this further in video form [HERE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DvYKy-L9USI&amp;feature=youtu.be).

What do you think?  Are gimmicky characters fine?  Am I exaggerating how they miss out in other aspects of the game?

Originally a party of six

So, one paladin who uses a two handed weapon (myself), one paladin that is an archer, and one paladin switch hitter (goes back and fourth between THW and sword and board). 

The switch hitter paladin whips out a scroll of Greater Dispel Magic, he is able to grab the BBEG. The party actually pauses here and looks at each other. The paladins declare smite evil and move in.

The archer fires off a few shots, smite evil, and a +2 disruption greatclub with holy and fire on it, I wail into the guy. First two attacks hit, so I'm like cool. The next two attacks hit as well. Thankfully, the monk is lowering the BBEG's AC. By the end of my attacks, I do right around 210 points of damage. On top of the damage the BBEG took previously

Again

The party all stands there

Then, we realize why the BBEG said we had already failed. 

An undead god appears in front of us, which everyone passes. 

Things just got real.

A new round of smites goes off. First is the archer, we only have a 25 percent chance of hitting. In the course of her rolling damage, we learn that only our smite and holy damage hurts it. So, 2d6 plus our level. The archer does about 14 points of damage. The Switch Hitter paladin whips out another scroll, this one of haste, and casts it on us that had been in melee initially. The monk takes a potion of critical healing and tosses it at the BBEG, missing him but the DM allows for it to do splash damage of about two. The other paladin moves in and isn't able to get past the hit chance. I move in

The undead god continues to laugh and continues to taunt us. Randomly determined

Our turn.

The monk moves to pick up items from the dead paladin for any extra scrolls he might have had. The archer goes another couple of points of damage. The sword and board paladin can't get through the miss chance. I attack

Me-""It's an undead god?""
DM-""Yes.""
Me-""Make a will save versus disruption.""

The DM pauses and shrugs. In a change of pace, on the BBEG. I shoot up automatically and celebrate my success. The DM frowns but nods, we ended that undead god.

1. **Sorcerer**: Adolamin, so Adolamin was a pretty boring character. Still, he was a good first try and sort of fun at the time.

2. **Paladin**: Kevros

3. **Magus**: Penguin, but it was only for one session so I'm not counting it. Penguin was a codename of sorts; the whole pirate crew had them. This character was just terrible. The reason being that my DM decided to try letting me combine Magus with guns and very poorly homebrewed some rules, then blamed me for being a powergamer when I just did what he said I could. We all try our best to forget that campaign, for plentiful reasons.

4. **Inquisitor**: Siarnaq, so I didn't come up with much of a backstory. It was a strange cross between the Inner Sea, the Dragon Empires, and Mass Effect. Yeah. The only races allowed were Tengu, Nagaji, Gnome, and ""Turian"" which I think is from Mass Effect. But Siarnaq was an Inquisitor of Pharasma who was all about respecting the dead and shit. 

5. **Monk**: Janus, which he did far more effectively than the DM anticipated, while also selling out to the BBEG Emperor for tons of cash. At the end of the campaign he conned himself into becoming the new Emperor with a pet dragon.

6. **Alchemist**: Alberio, back to old DM. We were all very excited for this game which was planned to be very seafaring and piratey. Alberio was an outcast who had blown up one too many houses and been run out of town. He finally died in a fight with a high-level Wererat. He used Rage Mutagen and Enlarge Person, spent a Hero Point to get one more turn after dying, and grabbed the little guy, crushed him, and fell overboard together.

7. **Summoner**: Rigel, so he was very paranoid and trusted nobody. I thought there was room for interesting character growth, but everyone just hated him. I eventually got sick of him and replaced him with his successfull assassin, a Swordsage from 3.5 Tome of Battle who I thus won't discuss here.

8. **Wizard**: Pavo, GM C. Here's the good stuff. Pavo was an old man from an isolated desert nation who was traveling the world collecting knowledge. He was also a greedy, evil old bastard and everyone loved him. He was going to become a lich if the campaign had reached that level. One of the most fun (and overpowered - 27 Int at level 8) PCs I've played.

9. **Oracle**: Malachi, he was compassionate, generous, kind, and just, with a great backstory that I put a lot of work into. I really loved this character. He was also killed in the second session because another PC decided to just stay home instead of trying to find and kill a necromancer, and we got TPK'd by a gray render. Fuck that game

9. **Barbarian**: Iudocus, set in the desert. Iudocus's tribe had been wiped out by a mysterious plague, and he was out for revenge. When it was discovered that the plague was natural and didn't have any evil wizard or anything behind it, he left the party.

10. **Bard**: Cibran

11. **Druid**: Govannon, only fighting in self-defense and then as a last resort. It's getting hard to justify continuing, since we're currently invading a keep full of kobolds and slaughtering them just because another PC was told she was the distant heir of some old noblewoman she'd never heard of who died five years ago. Well, we'll see where it goes from here. Any advice?

12. **Ranger**: Ekchuah, GM C. Just played a mini-campaign where we were in a strike force in a war against Hobgoblins. It was pretty fun, if simple. Ekchuah had been captured by the hobgoblins and tortured for over a year, so he hated them more than anything. He got revenge on the specific torturer, by capturing him and bringing him back home to replicate every bit of it. I creeped myself out a bit with him.

13. **Witch**: Ben Ravencroft, GM D. Just about to start this campaign. Imagine a really angsty, rebellious 17-year old, and give him the power to control undead. I'm excited to see where this goes.

So the classes I have left are Cleric, Cavalier, and Gunslinger. (Gunslinger will be hard since neither of the current campaign settings I play in have guns...) Then I can play my favorite classes again - Paladin and Wizard. I did play several characters in one-shot games that didn't count: a halfling barbarian I don't recall the name or personality of, a human cleric of winter named Stark who turned evil and became an NPC after the first session, a human cavalier named Regulus who was just incredibly arrogant and self-absorbed, and a human fighter named Sinclair, a disgraced son of a famous swordsman out to prove his worth. I might bring that last one back...",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1dgs1y/my_ongoing_quest_to_play_every_base_class/

Merrik D’Averum (Rogue Level 7)
 
Description:  Race: Kayal (Fetchling) Height: 5’ 11”  Weight: 165 lbs  Age: 47  
Hair Color: Dark Violet  Eye Color: Pupilless Lightly glowing Blue-Green  Skin Color: Ashen Gray

Backstory: My name is Merrik D’Averum. I am of the Kayal people. As a young boy I went with my father and a few other family members to the Material Plane to trade goods from the Shadow Plane. But while we were trading with the humans a large group of bandits fell upon us leaving only me alive. I was made the personal slave of the group’s leader

After a week I picked my shackles and tried to escape. Being a skilled ranger Garris captured me with ease. I was severely beaten

Another month passed as I healed. It was around then that Garris began shaming me in front of the other gang members. It started with the occasional trip as I went by

It took Garris a full day to catch me this time. Lying at his feet, half hoping it was poisoned. Then he did the unthinkable. He untied me. 

After a silent minute he began to speak, a slave no longer. What ya think?”   I began laughing and when he came closer I spat in his face.  “You murdered my family, beat me half to death, and now you want me to JOIN you!” I laughed even harder. The blow that came knocked me cold.

When I awoke I found myself across the back of a horse wrapped in a blanket which was then wrapped in rope and tied. After a few seconds of pride for the lengths Garris had to go to just to keep me contained

Kagin was a master thief in the city Longmire. As soon as we arrived the rider gave Kagin a letter. I never did get to read it, was place a silver collar around my neck. With a click and a small electric tingle I knew I was in trouble. As he unwrapped me he began to tell me the collar was bound to a bracelet he wore and with it he could inflict varying levels of shocking pain at will. And he did, often. 

Over the coming years Kagin honed my skills to a razors edge, stealth, poison use, and the crafting and use of alchemical items. Whenever I would try to stand up to him or rebel in any way he would shock me into near unconsciousness and rape me.

He will be an old but very rich man

That's why he tried to become a wizard and learn how to do magic. But he couldn't memorize all these spells

Now I was thinking of making this character a rogue. 
With a high use magic device skill he would use wands/staves/scrolls created by a wizard he has hired.

Because he would be very rich the price of creating the items isn't a problem. However the time that needs to be spent to create the items would limit his access

And because he want's to be seen as a normal wizard he wouldn't use his money, etc.

I was thinking of giving him the magical aptitude feat and the false casting one. To make sure no one notices that he's really just using items. 

I would use the (rogue) carnivalist archetype as class

I was thinking that to get him new items he would send his familiar to the hired wizards, emulating the 8 hour rest and the 1 hour preparation of spells. 

This would also mean that he must choose which spells he'll get a day in advance. (he sends a note with the familiar for what he want's next.)

Now I'm curious to how balanced this would be. 
The number of item creation mages can be changed but he would get way less spells then normal wizards would be able to prepare. on the other hand

**C)** As above

|  
**Low DEX:**  
Your character has poor mind-body coordination. You find it difficult to react quickly to attacks in combat or in surprising situations, and navigating narrow ledges are especially harrowing.  
  
*RP:* A) Clumsy/klutz. You trip over things and yourself
**B)** Lame. Either through a physical deformity you were born with

**Low CON:**  
You have poor endurance. You are more susceptible to pain and fatigue
  
*RP:* A) Wheezy old geezer
B) You have very low pain tolerance. Could be partially mental (low will)
**C)** Sickly (low str). Either through a debilitating disease/cancer (past and recovered but left weakened
|  
|  
**Low INT:**

I could see maybe going with Improved DR a few times

Equipment is really up to you.  I go with a couple big two-handed weapons: Greatsword and Lucerne Hammer.  With them I have all three damage types, but you're really not going to avoid anything, even if they roll a 2.  A chain shirt is fine.  

When raging

Every round you can quick draw a drink (as long as your DM allows quick drawing things that aren't weapons) and as a move action down the drink without provoking and gain 20 temp hp.  This along with the invulnerable rager's DR 10/- gives you 30 points of damage mitigation every round.  You have no AC

So attack the saves right?  He's got that covered too.  
Fort: +27  
Refl: +12  
Will: +18  
Then on top of that

Even if you are taking tons of damage, you can use Ferocious Tenacity to sacrifice rage rounds to mitigate that damage.  You'll have plenty of rage rounds to spare because Drunken Brute's Raging Drunk power lets that drink you drank keep you from expending your rage round each turn.  

One might ask if there are deleterious effects to drinking alcohol every 6 seconds.  There would be if you weren't immune to nausea and sickened from Internal Fortitude.  

The only real sacrifice is that you can't full attack because you're using your move action to drink every round.  I could see why one might want to invest in Vital Strike feats to make up for this

As sad as we were

Now a little bit about our intrepid crew. We've got a group of 5 including a pair of rogues (one designed for diplomacy, divining wizard, and a monk. 

We had recently tackled a large room full of zombies and some homebrewed symbiotic tongues and only wasted two level 2 spells to do it. Beyond that, so we unknowingly were being stalked by the boss. 

We finally cleared the rest of the floor we were on, here came a pretty ugly looking frog demon. (I tried to find it on SRD, but no luck) The rogues opened up with a volley of crossbow fire, but no luck, the druid spent a few rounds making the monk stronger and much more threatening while the wizard spent the early rounds trying to incapacitate the boss with no real luck. 

After the initial volley, our diplomatic rogue took up pursuit. The next thing you know, we have the boss trapped in a corner, the rogues both failing miserably to do any good damage on the thing and taking some nasty damage with con and charisma negatives as well. The druid and his croc make it around and begin healing after one rogue falls, and the croc tries unsuccessfully to bite the boss. 

In the last couple rounds, both rogues, monk, and croc had fallen and the druid who was on his last couple hit points had his shillelagh out and the wizard had cast true strike on himself. The wizard moved in and cast his last shocking grasp with moderate damage. 

It all came down to one more roll, and did just enough damage to topple the frog demon. 

The whole table collectively let out a sigh of relief when the DM said the boss went down. We spent the next hour doing what most groups would do after such a hard fight and defiled the boss' body in every way we could think of.

My question is would you suggest to someone who has never played this style of game to start with this and would it be beneficial or even possible to introduce my children to the genre through the median as well. In my head I can picture having a blast with them but as we all know how you picture things and how they actually happen can be completely different.

1337331879.0,tt1jm,I am working on extremely detailed maps for the Beginner Box. Interest?  Feedback?,FumbledAgain,28,3,16,"I'm a big fan of digital maps over physical ones, [here's fog of war applied to the first adventure in the box](http://i.imgur.com/2Wx33.gif).

I've taken that a step further and am in the process of creating a photorealistic replacement for the [map on page 25](http://i.imgur.com/fRnpj.png) of the Game Master's Guide included in the Beginner Box

[An overview of the entire map

[The level of detail I'm including](http://i.imgur.com/Jcm5O.jpg)

Obviously, Room 12 is designed as a lab/workshop where Thelsikar works on the elixir that he's feeding to Black Fang to make him more powerful.  I've envisioned Room 13 as a temple where Thelsikar worships Lamashtu, and where he performs incantations.  The arcane circles are places he could perform spells and potentially summon demons, monsters, etc.

I've only been working on this for a day or so and there's still a lot of detail to be added

Also, in which fog of war is applied on a room-by-room basis... or perhaps each room is provided separately, to be presented one at a time.

Thoughts?  Feedback?

*Edit:*

**Changes I'll be making to the map:**

1. Upon reading the background of Lamashtu
2. I think I'll remove two of the three arcane circles in the temple as three makes things too cluttered, right?  ;-)
3. Not sure what color the glow in the cauldron should be - how does one brew an elixir or potency for a dragon?
4. Will be adding detail/contents to all of the rooms in the upper-right quadrant of the map, 6, 7, 15, and 16.
5. The secret passageways shown between rooms 1-6, or simply let GMs draw over it with a pen/mapping tool as-needed.  Preference?
6. I am conceptualizing Room 16 as the entrance to Black Fang's lair... possibly as a ""Level 2"" of the dungeon.  In the first adventure, it would make sense that you'd have to go down to this second level in order to find it.  I'm also thinking that the most likely place for a tower in the hills is... on one of those hills, perhaps one with one side that terminates into some kind of a cliff, kind of like [Half Dome](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half_Dome).  This would allow the entrance to Black Fang's new lair to be more secret and impossible to access other than through the dungeon, to avoid unintentional first-encounters (if the party does something unexpected, such as scout the hill from the sides) to be with the dragon rather than with the rest of the dungeon.  If you want to avoid spoilers, the cave could be only visible from above
7. I will probably do a map of the surrounding area

* Bard (me) used Inspire Courage, spent the turn babbling.
* Faerie Dragon (my familiar) used Grease on where the boss was in the cloud. He falls down.

* Witch Glitterdust'd the archers in the cloud.
* I move and draw my net
* My dragon moves up next to the cloud and uses its Breath of Euphoria. Boss fumbles and becomes staggered and sickened for 6 rounds.

Round 3:

* Boss (nauseated
* Witch used Evil Eye lowering his saves and cackles.

* I blind him with Glitterdust and bring up Inspire Courage.
* Faerie dragon recasts Greater Invisibility.

1358416256.0,16qtvv,Cleric mobility tank guide,nicholsml,30,7,44,"I'm writing this after reading a few other posts about tanks and to offer something different from the usual fighter or pally tank. If you have useful input regarding cleric mobility tanks

**Why a cleric?**

While clerics don't make the best melee based characters

**AC**

This is the bread and butter of the tank class. You need a high AC to avoid spell interrupts and mitigate damage. A fighter has a slight advantage in AC at higher levels but as a cleric your mobility will be unmatched. Also Cleric tanks that have the correct domains and feats will have a much higher AC then pallies. Although pallies have an advantage with their saving throws over the other tanks and a circumstantial melee advantage with smite.

To have access to the heavy armor and tower shields you will need

You want to get your AC as high as possible. You want to focus on dodge and deflection AC bonuses within reason because they stack and they also count against touch attacks. The diminishing returns to cost/effectiveness means you simply take deflection and dodge bonuses first

**AC Bonuses** 

These bonus descriptions are copied straight from the [PFSRD](http://www.d20pfsrd.com/)

&gt; **Bonus (Circumstance)**

&gt; A circumstance bonus (or penalty) arises from specific conditional factors impacting the success of the task at hand. Circumstance bonuses stack with all other bonuses

&gt; **Bonus (Competence)**

&gt; A competence bonus (or penalty) affects a character's performance of a particular task, skill checks, caster level checks, or any other checks to which a bonus relating to level or skill ranks would normally apply. It does not apply on ability checks, damage rolls, initiative checks, or other rolls that aren't related to a character's level or skill ranks. Multiple competence bonuses don't stack; only the highest bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Deflection)**

&gt; A deflection bonus affects Armor Class and is granted by a spell or magic effect that makes attacks veer off harmlessly. Deflection bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other deflection bonuses. A deflection bonus applies against touch attacks.

&gt; **Bonus (Dodge)**

&gt; A dodge bonus improves Armor Class (and sometimes Reflex saves) resulting from physical skill at avoiding blows and other ill effects. Dodge bonuses are never granted by spells or magic items. Any situation or effect (except wearing armor) that negates a character's Dexterity bonus also negates any dodge bonuses the character may have. Dodge bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC

&gt; **Bonus (Enhancement)**

&gt; An enhancement bonus represents an increase in the sturdiness and/or effectiveness of armor or natural armor, creature (in the case of natural armor), or ability score do not stack. Only the highest enhancement bonus applies. Since enhancement bonuses to armor or natural armor effectively increase the armor or natural armor's bonus to AC, they don't apply against touch attacks.

&gt; **Bonus (Insight)**

&gt; An insight bonus improves performance of a given activity by granting the character an almost precognitive knowledge of what might occur. Multiple insight bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest insight bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Luck)**

&gt; A luck modifier represents good (or bad) fortune. Multiple luck bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest luck bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Morale)**

&gt; A morale bonus represents the effects of greater hope, cowardice, and despair in the case of a morale penalty). Multiple morale bonuses on the same character do not stack. Only the highest morale bonus applies. Non-intelligent creatures (creatures with an Intelligence of 0 or no Intelligence at all) cannot benefit from morale bonuses.

&gt; **Bonus (Natural Armor)**

&gt; A natural armor bonus improves Armor Class resulting from a creature's naturally tough hide. Natural armor bonuses stack with all other bonuses to Armor Class (even with armor bonuses) except other natural armor bonuses. Some magical effects (such as the barkskin spell) grant an enhancement bonus to the creature's existing natural armor bonus

&gt; **Bonus (Profane)**

&gt; A profane bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of evil. Multiple profane bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest profane bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Sacred)**

&gt; A sacred bonus (or penalty) stems from the power of good. Multiple sacred bonuses on the same character or object do not stack. Only the highest sacred bonus applies.

&gt; **Bonus (Shield)**

&gt; A shield bonus improves Armor Class and is granted by a shield or by a spell or magic effect that mimics a shield. Shield bonuses stack with all other bonuses to AC except other shield bonuses. A magic shield typically grants an enhancement bonus to the shield's shield bonus


**Shields**

Tower shield, there really is no good reason not to get a tower shield. Your offence when needed will mostly come from your spells. When you do attack it will be to make touch attacks and to gain a defensive fighting bonus, so only the effort counts.

**Armor**

Full plate is generally preferred when you can afford it. Initially its movement penalty can be offset if you choose good cleric tank domains. Also making the item mithral adds +2 to the max dexterity bonus. Outside of exotics and third party armor

**Stats**

Dex is the most important stat followed closely by wisdom and then constitution and charisma... but you need to balance your dex with whatever armor you chose. Also take into account boosts to dex from magical items. So Dexterity is the most important stat but only up to the armor induced cap. For instance.... Full plate gives a +1 to max dex bonus. This will be upped to +3 from making the armor mithral. So with full plate make your dex 14 for a +2 dex bonus and leaves room to add 2 points of dexterity from items for a total of +3 from dex. Now you're free to add points to your wisdom and then constitution. Also be sure to keep at least a +1 or +2 in charisma for channeling.

**Feats**

You are going to want to take any feat that provides bonuses to your AC. Those feats will be dodge for a +1 dodge bonus, it adds a +1 to your shield bonus but remember shield bonuses do not count against touch attacks and anything that discounts your shield discounts this feat. So take it after getting other armor class feats. Shield wall is another great shield feat but it is only useful when you have a buddy who will be adjacent and has the feat as well. Its usefulness is circumstantial.

Toughness. At some point you will need to take this feat. While a tanks role is to mitigate damage over taking damage, but if you totally neglect your hit points it will catch up to you sooner or later. 

**Domains**

* Travel- Travel is an essential domain for a cleric tank. It adds 10 to your movement and once you gain the dimension hop ability you essentially become immune to grapples. If you are serious about being a cleric tank

* Elemental Domains- Domains such as earth and air can be handy because of their elemental damage reduction offered at mid to high levels. For example earth gives acid DR and air gives electrical DR.

* Chaos Domain- Chaos’s ability

* War Domain- This domain is good because of the domain spells and buffs it offers

* Luck Domain- Luck has limited use for a tank build but it does offer freedom of movement in the domain list which can be handy for mobility.

* Liberation Domain- Liberation offers freedom of movement and helps to avoid difficult terrain. It partialy coincides with some of travel domains abilities but in some cases more can be better.

* Healing and Sun Domain- Both are handy for utility but offer little for making yourself a more effective tank. Take them only if you don’t have better options or want to combine damage or healing to your build. 

**Magical/Wondrous Items**

* Muleback Cords- Muleback cords give you a +8 to strength when calculating encumbrance. This is very useful since you have so many stats to put points into to be effective that you usually end up with a low strength. You will probably need this item to use heavy armor and heavy shields. It uses a shoulder slot.

* AC Items- Any item such as a ring of protection or an amulet of natural armor is going to be important. Take these items as early as possible and focus on dodge and deflection bonuses before others. Don't forget AC Ion stones to put in your wayfinder.

* Boots of Striding and Springing, Flying bonus (winged boots, less important when you have the travel domain) or Boots of speed (high movement bonus, limited number of uses).

* Stat Boosting Items- Any items that add to Dex/Wis/Con/Cha are going to be very important because they can all directly affect your survivability when it comes to health or AC. Examples... belt of might or headband of mental prowess. 

* Sash of the War Champion- The sash of the War champion gives you Armor training as a cleric, read it careful and understand it might be ruled against you using it. In the end it is the GM's call so make sure you run it by your society organizer before buying.

**Prestige Classes**

* Holy Vindicator- The vindicator can be a great prestige to take because it allows you to continue to gain more channels and offers a high BAB bonus. Also it has an ability where you can channel into your shield for an extremely high shield bonus to AC until you are hit with a roll against your AC. For example

* Stalwart Defender- In some cases this prestige class might be desirable but when you take it you no longer gain cleric powers that define your cleric tank. It generally isn't preferred. 

**Tactics**

* Spellcasters- One of the great parts about high defense and high mobility provided by cleric tanks is the silence spell. You are literally a nightmare for any spell casting class. Cast silence on yourself and trigger your move to follow the caster. You will effectively be moving your silence spell around wherever they go. If you picked the travel domain you will be able to fly

* Compel Hostility- This  is a great spell to force opponents to attack you for a round instead of your team mates. Because of  your high armor class you can mitigate a lot of damage this way. You can only use the spell once per attacker.

* Dimensional Hop- You can use this travel ability to avoid being grappled and you can also pull team mates out of grapples as long as you can touch them. Also while the dimension hop is your movement action

1368820077.0,1ejbvs,Why Cleave Sucks,Lucretius,35,15,80,"Of late

Standards:  What makes a feat good or bad.

The value of a feat can be understood in the following mathematical formula:

	Value = Probability x Impact - Opportunity-Cost

That is to say, again all other things being equal, a feat that does something powerful is more useful than one that does something weak... a feat that when useful does something powerful has a high Impact.  Ideally, a feat will both have a high Probability  AND a high Impact.  However it should be pointed out that both Probability and Impact are effected by strategy, tactics, and play style.  For example, Power Attack is not much use to most wizards.  Lastly, but not massively less useful than alternative feats... The standard of the general value of alternative feats is Opportunity cost.

There are four problems with Cleave:  It's Probability is incredibly low.   It's Impact is at best moderate.  The Opportunity-Cost is high.  AND It has additional down sides.

**Probability**: Cleave can only work if two opponents are adjacent to one another.  This does not happen often because there is no advantage to opponents being adjacent, and are in formation to receive area effect spells.  So even before the enemies know you have cleave, they are likely going to be avoiding cleave formation by default.  And of course it's a trick you can only use once per combat because once they see you use it, they'll stop standing beside one another.  I think I'm being generous when I say that an opportunity to use Cleave will show up once every three combats on average.  Great Cleave is in some ways even worse... the probability of having more than two opponents simultaneously adjacent to each other and also in reach is even lower.  

**Impact**: An extra attack sounds powerful, that's not a big sacrifice since one was getting only one attack anyway unless one uses Two Weapons, of Flurry, or multiple Natural Attacks.  But at BAB of 6 or higher, Cleave starts to look like an increasingly poor deal: give up two or more attacks of the full attack sequence to get two (or more if you also have wasted another feat slot on Great Cleave) attacks from Cleave.  True, all attacks with cleave are at full bonus whereas iterative attacks are at progressively lower bonuses, but that is balanced by the fact that iterative attacks can all focus on the same opponent whereas Cleave forces you into the sub optimal strategy of spreading out your damage.

**Opportunity Cost**: Opportunity cost is a term from economics.  It refers to the cost of not doing other activities because you are busy doing something else.  As such the opportunity cost for a feat is a function of the comparison of the value of other feats that could be taken in its place.  There are SO MANY better feats that could be taken in place of Cleave.  Weapon Focus... Probability is near certain that you'll use it near every single attack.  Dodge... even more certain to be useful.    Here's another way to calculate the opportunity cost of the Cleave feat: A potion of Haste at minimum caster level of 5 provides 4 extra attacks counting the lost round for drawing and drinking the potion.  If we assume a fairly standard 12 combats per level gained and use the one in three combats probability of finding side-by-side opponents that I estimated above, Cleave will provide a total of 80 extra attacks over the course of 240 combats... that's the equivalent of 20 potions of Haste.  Now, imagine you were give a choice... sacrifice your 1st level feat slot for 20 potions of Haste... would you take that deal?  Of course not, because it sucks, but taking the Cleave feat is doing exactly that.

**Down Sides**: As if all this weren't enough, I'm already extremely unimpressed, but using Cleave ALSO gives you a -2 AC penalty (as if it weren't bad enough already).

All-in-all, it lets you have multiple attacks after using a move action to close with the enemy.  In essence, it's an alternative to Charge... instead of sacrificing -2 AC for a bonus to attack and the ability to move twice one's base speed and still attack, you can sacrifice -2 AC for an extra attack after a move action under certain very rare conditions.  But is this ability really worth a feat slot?

I'm not sure what the fasted possible speed is.  An extended long range spell cast at 20th level can reach 2

Here's where it deviates further from physics:
1) Basic energy types.  Acid, Fire, Sonic.  First, Cold is an energy of it's own, and not the absence of heat. An item can be enchanted with both Flaming and Frost; they don't cancel each other out.  Second, acidity is an energy type, and not necessarily a physical property, acids aren't differentiated in terms of what they react best with (organic acids

2) Positive and Negative energy can also be stored and harnessed

3) There are elemental planes, this gives us 8 basic matter and/or force components to make an item with.

4) Morality behaves as a physical property.  There are spells which can repel creatures of a certain morality

5) Teleportation is possible, I think there's also actual time travel, so it may just be that portals and teleportation both function as extremely limited forms of time travel.  This still does squirrely things with relativity.

It seems to me, and even then, you can't use items like bracers of archery. Most of all though, crossbows lack any ability to add strength to damage.

I am considering house-ruling something to reflect the power of crossbows and putting them on the same level as bows. I have 3 ideas so far:

1. Increase the hit die of all crossbows (this is my least favorite)
2. Make crossbows attack vs. touch within a certain range; probably half of the weapon's range
3. All of the the above

Does anyone have thoughts on this or play with house rules for crossbows in their games?

EDIT: After a lot of consideration of all of these excellent replies, damage die/critical,  and the lack of strength needed for the crossbow, I believe it to be a rather nicely balanced weapon. I will, however, implement an item for crossbow users equivalent to the bracers of archery for bow users.",,self,,

After the 4th Editition game a few friends and I were in ended due to the DM dealing with work drama, Pathfinder Campaign! I wanted to skip past the first two levels of play

I quickly got about 15 different interested individuals. I figured that the campaign itself would turn into just a few dedicated people like my last campaign in the States... but No. Three of them backed out from work issues, but after some loose prep and a lot of focus on populating the starting adventure with a lively town, small encounters, and one large uniting hook that brought the characters together, the session became an amazing experience as a DM and I've already had a lot of positive feedback from the players.

As there were a few players new to the system I made sure each mini encounter or skill test covered the range of available situations that might arise in any given session. I had six of the players come into town by three separate ships, and the two alchemists were introduced to what would be their drug running commander. The other two were left to explore the town, but by choice they went directly to the next goalpoint, the town Brewery.

After each duo joined up, and as I had saved character sheets in some format from that campaign, I was able to describe each NPC in detail as needed. There was a short RP session, in which the players expressed why they had come to the town, whether it was to trade or to seek adventuring work...

And in the middle of this, A bugbear, and about 8 Hobgoblins, charging one of the gates of this well defended but poorly fortified town. The players left the brewery, rushing across town in a frenzy of streetwise and acrobatics checks to find their way towards the gates. The Ogres burst through the gates and made quick work of the town guards, and were slowly but steadily thinned down and kept controlled by the players until at last they had dispatched the final hobgoblin. I kept combat short by implementing the (You prepare your action and be ready on your turn to declare what you'll do, get a +1 bonus) Homerule. It really increased the speed of combat.

During this attack I had a second warband, who specializes in Heavy Explosives. The goblins slip in, but are smelled by the dog-mount of the gnomish gunslinger... but far too late. After running back across the town and a couple rounds of combat, having defeated almost all of the goblins, the Explosives planted in the Town Portal Building go off, destroying the main source of travel to and from the city. (Traveling by sea is dangerous, and the old highway hasn't been used in years due to the reliability and convenience of the teleportation system) After planting the explosives, lighting the ship two of the PCs came in on... that was carrying gunpowder and arms for the town guard. The Ship explodes

Everyone had equal playtime and every character contributed during combat. Each character had a vested interest in the town

I have noticed, since they deal with factors that can be huge differences at low level. Example: At first level, something with only three hit dice has almost three times the hit points of a first level PC. Whereas at tenth level, something with twelve hit dice only has a much smaller fraction more. The same difference in HD, but a huge difference in magnitude.

It is fun and we're starting to get a returning cast of characters

And I've got a group, but vastly amusing. The game is an open one where people can come and sit in for a week (or longer) if there is room at the table. Last week we had a huge party, and this week we had a group of 8. 1/2 warrior types and 1/2 rouge types.

I had to share tonight's story

Tonight the group was lamenting at the start of the game the fact that they've gone almost two sessions and they have not gotten into any fights. (They had the opportunity last week for at least two and turned down the chance.) They were doing some exploring under the city and had found what they were looking for

Then they heard a hiss, thump. Rhythmically, and organic. 

They decided to investigate.

They find an area that is under part of the city

The rest of the group positions themselves in a defensive area and takes up areas under cover and try to get ready to handle anything that may be coming their way.

Everything is going to plan. The sneakers need to see how well they're doing.

Player 1. Roll... Critical success! He has blended with the shadows and has gotten a much better view of what is going on.

Player 2. Roll... Critical failure! He has clattered over something on the ground

The rhythmic hiss thump hiss thump comes to an abrupt end. 

A group of lizards walking upright come to see what is making all the noise nearby. The first player sees the lizards in the distance and does a quick count

The lizard stops and puzzles over this

""Ummm.... .... .... YES!""

Lizard then asks ""So you have the markings?!?"" 

""Umm... ... ... yes.""

The lizard turns around to reveal in the torchlight a black tattoo of crude wings on its back.

""You

The player looks at me, and if I can't I drop it.""

GM - Um

Player ""I've been punished, I came to find you, those who believe.""

The second game i read many of the rules

 I had the beginner box so i had to read on the internet and the worst part was that the people having those classes wanted them to be made the day the game was going to be instead of the day before. If you got 5 people, besides the beginners box character creation was just confusing. 


As i read the rules, its goal, but got constantly interrupted. I hate this. 

They went from people who only seemed vaguely interested and who were difficult to include to being dead serious on the rules of the game. Which means they completely missed my attempts at explaining how being strict on rules mostly ruins the games


Suddenly while i was trying to lead the game they claimed to know the rules better then me, but at my first game i choose to ignore it so that we don't have to spend our whole game reading the whole book. i felt like explaining more aspects of the game was more important. 

Improvising worked

One guy (cleric) even decided going alone for a chest ahead of their team was a good idea and got mad when he got consequences for his bad perception and AC skills when the chest turned out to be living. I understand that me being uncertain of myself made people nervous as they didn't really know how to play the game so they tried to focus on the rules. Be prepared or be mercilessly criticized

In this game i tried to explain how it didn't matter, explain carefully and make it a point, that good roleplay makes a great game, not following the rules. The rules can be altered and still be great, some rules can be forgotten and you can choose when to include certain rules. Mention to them, that looking in the book for every little detail ruins the experience more then it enhances it. Also with disagreements, rule discussions and arguing the GM is the one to make the final call. 

This i believe is best as that through a noob adventure you can decide later if having certain equipment will be necessary. It is important to explain this because many people make their characters based on combat style and when you fuzz with the rules it makes them pissed. 

What i also lacked was passion for my game

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Shocking Defense
Shocking Defense I Cl(5th) II Cl(10th) III Cl(15th)
Effect: Upon taking damage from a melee weapon this armor or shield property activates causing 1d6(+1 enhancement cost) 2d4(+2 enhancement cost) or 2d6(+3 enhancement cost) to the attacker. A successful fort save halves all damage from attacks this round. The DC save for this is 10+ the caster level of the enhancement, and DC25 however if the weapon being used is solid metal (swords, but not an Axe) the fort save increases by +2. 
Required: Craft magic Armor
Side Note: I built this enchantment for a duelist I made specifically to wear down a the fighter in the party


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Thunder and Lighting 

These twin brass knuckles are made out of Adamantine and Mithral respectively. They add 1d6 Soinc or electric damage on unarmed attacks. Each of the weapons contains 3 charges per 3 days and can be recharged if left out during a thunderstorm.

“Thunder” Taking a standard action you can strike thunder against any hard surface (so sand doesn’t work) to stun creatures in a 15ft burst centered on the wielder. This ability uses 1 charge from Thunder

“Lighting” As a full attack action the wielder may fire out as many ranged touch (max 100ft) attacks as her base attack bonus allows

“Bring the Boom” as a full round action the wielder can slam Thunder and Lighting together to make a single ranged touch attack using the same circumstance bonus from the “Lighting” ability. It deals 10d6 damage in a line to the target as well as the “Thunder” Effect to both the target and to those on 5ft on either side of the line. This uses 2 charges from both Thunder and Lighting.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fire Tamers Whip

Dmg(S) 1d2+1d6 fire / Dmg(M) 1d3+1d6 fire / x2

This whip once per week may as a standard action allow the use of Control Flames as per the power with a manifester level of 12.

Bottled Tornado Cl(18th) 

Description: This small glass bottle has a picture of a crudely drawn tornado with a warning label with instructions on the back. The cork is firmly attached and when pulled off not much happens till the command words are spoken.

Ability(s): Command word: Ability

Trickle: Allows the user to breath out of the bottle for 30 rounds or 3 minuets so long as its held to its mouth.

Steady: Acts as a gust of wind spell for 5 rounds per day

Full Blast: Acts as a gust of wind spell

WARNING: No not allow bottle or cork to cause or to be cracked or broken. Doing so will release the small piece of the elemental plain of air to exist in this material plain. (This causes a massive tornado to tear everything apart within thousands of feet

**PC Classes** are Half Orc Fighter (Town Blacksmith)

I'm excited about this and I'm an experienced DM

They are mainly familiar with episodic TV shows so I was planning on doing this campaign in a similar style.  The main focus is to have something very simple

-a fairly linear story
-clear lines between good and evil (the bad guys are clearly bad)
-a longer starting session

**Here's what I have so far:**

All the PCs start as friends in a small logging village on the frontiers of a happy kingdom.  While going about their normal evening routine in the local innhouse a fist fight breaks out.  

Eventually, black cloak, wide brimmed hat, and a scarf/sash covering his lower face.  The Temple Head orders him to leave and it almost becomes a fight, but the **BAD GUY** leaves the bar, saying ""Your time is coming, old man.""

That night

Coming outside, where they will see the Temple Head trying to protect the other townsfolk trying to get inside for safety.

The Temple Head yells for them to get below into the catacombs and seal the door

Once the sounds of fighting stop

He hangs onto life longer enough to tell the PCs that they need to go to the Capitol and warn the King that the Dread Lords have returned and tells them he has a letter confirming this in his quarters he was writing after seeing the **BAD GUY** in the bar.  Then he dies (Que sad music)

The PCs head to his quarters to find someone already picking them over.  This turns out to be an old blind Oracle (NPC) who had visions that something terrible would happen here but that there was still hope to prevent the kingdom from falling.

She joins with the PCs, and out of combat healer.  Using supplies scavenged from the towns ruins, the PCs head out on the long journey to the capitol, desperately trying to stay ahead of the Dread Lord's Army advancing behind them.

When someone rolls a 20 (or a 18/19 with a special weapon), and because I don't like the fact that if you roll a critical hit when you did not originally have a great chance of hitting (say, a +5 attack against a 20 AC), you will probably not get your satisfying critical (and that's a shame, especially because you had the balls to try to hit the bad guy even if that was unlikely to succeed).

Of course, when my bad guys roll critical hits, I don't confirm them either. But I don't forbid feats like Disarming Strike (allows to attempt a Disarm roll on a critical hit) or Improved Critical (double the critical range of a weapon). Should I? Or in other terms, could one of my players create a build which relies on those rule modifications and make an overpowered character?

Edit: Thanks for your answers! It seems that if you're Min/Maxing, if I see one of my players create an entirely crit-based fighter, I'm gonna have to reevaluate the rules.

Now, messy 4th ed campaign geared on teaching them how to play and me how to DM. I specifically went with 4th ed for this reason, to ease them into tabletop gaming. I also went with this system because the variety of combat abilities for all classes appeals to me.

Now
I'll only directly compare the two systems to illustrate my preferences and not to judge which is objectively better.

* Do you find that Pathfinder system gives, but I find that it is harder as a result to get players to interact with the environment, favoring their wealth of abilities instead.
* I'm interested in heavily customizing a campaign, and a new setting. I know that the 3.5/Pathfinder system is more customizable, but due to its relative complexity (and while I consider myself competent) how difficult would such an endeavor with this system be for your average, somewhat experienced DM?
* I've always had trouble gauging the progression of game systems in terms of play speed. I always want to get my hands dirty and go with a long-term campaign
* This last question is related to the first, like on moving platforms, or across a chasm with a vine bridge stretched across, and I like to enable them to use the environment as a weapon. As a result, rules like grappling and throwing, or acrobatics and swimming are all important to me. I know that these are all a bit more complex in 3.5 / Pf, but do you find that they are suitable for significant use? My concern is that these are all actions with potentially deadly results for the players

I have more questions, I know I could get all these answers from doing and spending lots of time with my nose in the Pf rulebook, but I'd also love to hear firsthand opinion - after all, most of you are bound to have way more experience than I!

Edit:  Thanks for the ideas folks.  I've decided that I'm going to foreshadow something horrible happening to the dwarves in a series of dreams that will come to the divine casters the closer they get to the city.  I've already sent them the first dream: 

""You wake up, but can’t see anything that would cause you to feel like you’re being watched.  As you stand up, you notice your shadow growing longer.  You look around towards the other party members, and see their shadows are growing larger as well.

You back away and draw your weapon, but as you glance around you see the other party members are being attacked in their sleep by similar shadow monsters.  When you focus back on the creature approaching you

The dreams will get more and more specific about a shadow dragon destroying the dwarves as they progress.

Beginning with Waves and moving through Spellcasters, Items and many more, these elements can change a standard heroes fight villains encounter into much more.

From the scout fleeing to get others, the kobolds that suddenly rappel from the ceiling, the pack of viscous hounds summoned by the noise of battle.

Me and a friend of mine have a few gripes with how most combat feels in the few Pathfinder role-playing groups that we participate in. Mainly that it's mostly about dealing damage and that combat maneuvers and other more 'flavourful' combat options are rather inefficient when it comes to getting through combat.


I'm looking for a few ways for a DM to make his players consider other options in combat as viable alternatives to dealing damage. Since I don't think it will be possible to change the intrinsic attitude of some of the players who rather like power-play and dealing damage


From what I've experienced so far, making the more flavourful fighters that don't deal quite as much damage feel rather useless. For example: an 18 strength half-orc two-handed fighter with a greatsword and power attack hitting for 20-30 damage at level 6, versus a 10 strength, 16 dexterity, 16 charisma sword-sword finesse fighter heading towards Performing Combatant and related feats. I'm glad I got to switch Strength and Charisma and that we recently got to repick our feats (due to a houserules update).


Another thing of note is that we like to play at low levels and are using our own variant of Epic 8.

Roleplay - Do you make them roleplay the entire shopping experience?

When it comes to loot I like to use the random generators like on donjon or using combat manager. But for a list of items in stock I'm not sure exactly how to go about it. I realize that all of the options mentioned are viable

As for shopping I've simply told players to wait until next session so that I'll be prepared for what is in stock. I then (using the CRB and GM) rolled up a bunch of random items. It took forever! I looked into using random generators but they all seemed to be missing things ie

I'm going to omit myself from this because as much as I like to think I'm objective in my self-analysis


**The Gunslinger** has a developed character with long-term and short-term goals


**The fighter** knows very little about rules and mechanics, and now uses a two handed shovel and throwing spades as weapons. It's kinda hilarious listening to him describe combat.


On to **the bad: Our Catfolk Ninja** writes some fairly disturbing backstories or goals and doesn't seem to understand why these things would make him evil, and has been improving bit by bit. The only other issue with him is that he doesn't learn rules easily, and often seems to misinterpret rules in odd ways, which come up in combat and just slow everything to a halt. This is something else I'm working on, as I have a bit of a knack for memorizing rules when I try, so I'm working on expanding my knowledge and establishing with the group that I'm a reliable source of information (and the SRD on a laptop for source helps)


**Our Barbarian** is a barbarian. She gets bored with dialogue, when she is paying attention, tends to interrupt RP with ""I attack her/him/it."". If we don't want the fight, she threatens us in character (and one time out of character) into either helping or not interfering.


And, but I'll try and cut out the unimportant points. He’s created his whole world, and is incredibly proud of it. This is good, except he’s prewritten as much as he possibly can, and is very not-flexible when the group tries to pull off some hijinx or something. What this results in, and is the biggest issue I have right now, is that we’re on a railroad that isn’t interesting at all. We’ve been through three or four sessions at least, because there’s been no form of hook, it results in arguing


Aside from that, and in this group, none of us are likely to try until he royally pisses us off. In fact, of all of us, the DM is the one who, when he’s a player, is the MOST likely to break a campaign. That’s why we asked him to DM this in the first place

I'm pretty new at GMing

Basically, I figured they would just go with it, but I had a backup in case they wanted to argue. Basically, the NPC was much higher level, and the entire town kinda threatened the players if they decided to try to fight this guy. 

But things didn't go as planned. One of the players invited the NPC outside of the tavern they were in when he started talking to them. Then the other player decided to fight the NPC. Because they were outside, very strongly about the wrong that was committed previously), I ended up killing one of the player characters. 

Obviously, and thus felt very strongly against taking this quest. I suppose I could have had the NPC back down, but it didn't seem right, and I just kinda panicked and kept fighting.

The problem I am having is that there are so many enchantments that it seems really cheap.

Spectacles of Noticing Things:

* Command Word Read Magic = 0.5 x 1 x 1800 = 900
* Command Word Detect Magic = 0.5 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 = 1350
* Command Word Detect Poison = 0.5 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 = 1350
* Command Word Detect Undead 2/day = 1 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 / 2.5 = 1080
* Command Word Detect Secret Doors 2/day = 1 x 1 x 1800 x 1.5 / 2.5 = 1080

Total = 5760gp Cost to make = 2880gp  6 days creation time

I would rule the CL is actually 1 so that makes it nice and easy to make.

Is this right? Seems cheap to me!

Regarding the multiplier for additional effects ... I was considering a house rule that increases the multiplier for additional effects. According to the RAW, 2.5 for the fourth effect and 3 for a fifth effect.

So he assigns the PC's a task upon their meeting of him. 



He has an ambassador with a plan. The plan is that the PC's escort the ambassador to collect all the pieces of a shattered sword that is legend to have been used by the emperor that turned the scattered provinces into a nation. The sword is legend to have a great power: anytime it was revealed, the sword shattered. and each piece was given to a ruling lord of each and every sector of the nation.



So the ambassador wants to go to each and every warring state. collect the piece of the sword. find a way to reforge it

So, sometimes the druid's animals are slightly better suited for a fight, but then when you apply the celestial/infernal template to the cleric's summons (which you're supposed to do) they often get way better than what the druid can do.  This seems stupid, so I started looking for better ways that a druid can get animals.

I found this set of spells that basically gives me a summoned animal for *hours.*  First, waiting.  Next, cast Charm Animal, which lasts an hour per level.  Finally, cast Speak With Animals, and run through a few commands that will be useful after Speak With Animals fades.

Now you have a summoned animal which is, and it lasts an hour/level instead of round/level.  Due to the Speak With Animals spell, you may have it able to handle a rudimentary command or two, and due to Charm Animal it may not require you to do Handle Animal checks.

Of course, I had to spend a small bit of my starting cash to get a scroll of Speak With Animals.  I was only able to do my trick once, and then had to wait until I came into money.

However, the DM gave me a thrylacine (??? not sure if I wrote that correctly, but it's a dog-like animal featured in the Kingmaker campaign), and allowed it to have 2 commands (""attack this"" and ""come to me"").  It would aid me &amp; my animal companion without complaint, and usually made it through an entire mini-dungeon (such as the mite cave system).  I tried to leave each animal in a good state (fully healed or nearly so) and the DM never had them attack me when the Charm spell wore off.

I'm not a new player, and the two unfortunates were a cleric, and a rogue.

One of my co-workers has expressed interest in joining my game and after discussing it with the group I told him that it was cool to join. He seems to have his heart set on creating a Halfling Barbarian that does not use weapons in combat. His backstory involves something along the lines of being abandoned as a baby

Anywho...like I said he doesnt want to use weapons

His stats are as follows (11th level Barb): 16 STR | 20 DEX | 15 Con | 10 INT | 10 WIS | 10 Char

I spoke with him and he decided to pick up the Beast totems giving him a claw attack and bite attack while raging. Purchasing two Rings of Rat Fangs would give him 2 additional bite attacks (along with making him look fairly rat-like). He also purchased a +2 Amulet of Mighty Fists.

As for feats he went with:

* Belier's Bite (1d4 Bleeding Damage when hitting an enemy with an unarmed attack)
* Eldritch Claws (Natural Weapons are considered magical and silver for overcoming DR)
* Improved Natural Attack (Bite)
* Improved Unarmed Strike
* Multiattack 
* Rending Claws (If you hit a creature twice with a claw attack

A full round of attacks (very easy to do with pounce) will do the following:

* 1d2+9+1d4 Bleeding Damage
* 1d6+6
* 1d3+6
* 1d4+6 (Bite-Animal Fury Rage Power)

At his current level (11) he will put out a maximum of 91 Damage and up to 4 Bleeding damage applied to the target. Is there anything I am missing

When my character survives a fierce battle, or achieves something, I enjoy knowing that there was a chance I might have failed. The possibility I might fail makes the successes meaningful.

Knowing that the outcome of a fight was decided based on a whim takes a lot of the fun out of it. As for magic effects and items

This came up around our gaming table recently and a few of us had different assumptions as to how the spell works. I'm confident (95% /*shrug*) that my analysis is correct but feedback is very welcome as we can all roll a 1 from time to time. I've included the relevant text below

&gt; [**Phantom Steed**](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/phantomSteed.html#_phantom-steed)  
&gt; School: conjuration (creation)  
&gt; Casting Time: 10 minutes  
&gt; Range: 0 ft.  
&gt; Effect: one quasi-real
&gt; Duration: 1 hour/level (D)  
&gt; Saving Throw: none; Spell Resistance: no  

&gt; You conjure a Large, gray mane and tail, and smoke-colored, insubstantial hooves that make no sound. It has what seems to be a saddle, bit, and bridle. It does not fight, but animals shun it and refuse to attack it.  

&gt; The mount is AC 18 (-1 size, the phantom steed disappears. A phantom steed has a speed of 20 feet per two caster levels, to a maximum of 100 feet at 10th level. It can bear its rider's weight plus up to 10 pounds per caster level.  

My view - Sooo it's not a creature, is it affected by spells such as [Stinking Cloud](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/stinkingCloud.html#_stinking-cloud) and [Cloudkill](http://paizo.com/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/cloudkill.html#_cloudkill)? I would assume it's the same as an unseen servant in these cases and say no.  

More importantly I think

On the other hand, at best, half the speed of a running horse.  

So I would say that the movement speed is it's flat walking speed and that it can't be made to hustle or run; even though it is horse-*like* it is still not a horse.

I've found that this group is good fun

When it's my turn to DM, so you can only play one of these five races.""  ""Oh, your a ship crew, so we need a Pilot, a captain, an engineer and some muscle""  Stuff like that.

My newest plan for limiting is to build characters as we go along.  So, there would be rewards of ability or skill points for successful challenges.  If they make up some story from their past that would help them accomplish this task, then they get a modifier to complete it.

Let me explain:  ""You figured out a way around this issue cleverly and something that I hadn't planned for.  You spent time making sure that the details were worked out

And, you gain 1 strength.  If you fail, you lose 1 strength.""  PC: ""But when I was a kid in the mines they worked me extra hard, so I'm used to moving these kinds of boulders.""  GM: ""Okay, you get a +2 on your roll."" 

There would also be skill checks.  You rode the shit out of that horse with that roll.  Gain +1 Ride.

etc.

Now

But the idea is that there are lots of different tasks, rather than dumping a stat and using it anyway.  AND developing a back-story as you go along, so that it's got all these little details and memories that come into play, rather than the generic, ""I was orphaned and went looking for adventure.""

After 3 sessions or so, get their class skills, spells, etc. and be ready to continue the story as level 1s (or possibly level 2s).

Backstory: 

“Smooth trade

But Merilee holds out hope that the gods will weigh his deeds justly

Born Merristor Boffin Leelik (at least those are the given names that stuck), the thirty-some families managed to thrive for centuries out of fierce devotion to defense, enlightenment, and each other. 
Bored with learning, lest he be sent to apprentice at his uncle’s cobbling enterprise in Edme. Sure enough, his parents’ threats proved true. Edme was a colorless place, with less spirit than he thought a place could have. Shoe making was less interesting than even his studies had been, but his uncle allowed him free reign. Seeking some form of excitement, Merrilee soon found his skills of extortion to be most profitable when unfettered by parental scorn. He was making more money with his new friends via illegal means than he could ever make as a cobbler. It was a quick, slippery slope. He moved out, song

Merrilee never could intimidate even a copper from someone

One twilight, word of their exploits had caught the ear of Galtan national advisors. Wanting to make an example, an inquisitor set up an ambush. As they stopped the wagon, it burst open with a score of swordsmen—nearly triple his accompaniment. His friend fled, but his short legs couldn’t make flight fast enough. He was the sole prisoner, and the inquisitor was determined to make him pay for the sins of the whole group.

He lost count of the days he served in The Monolith in Isarn. It was easily months, and his waking hours to torture his mind. He was certain he had now found a place even more sullen than the dirty streets of Edme. Songs were forbidden. His only solace was whispered humming of his mother’s old lullabies. He met a human man by the name of Yacques who had no fingers. Nearing his death by malnutrition, the man shared his story. He played lute in a troupe of performers who joked and sang about political oppression in Galt. Once they started changing the minds of the people, they were all maimed so they could never ply their craft again. One thing Yacques said stuck with him: “Promise me one thing, boy. If you ever get out, learn the lute. Play the thing so loud that I can hear you in the afterlife.” Tears streaming down his face, Merrilee swore to Yacques.

It wasn’t long after Yacques’ passing that Pentuk (LG clr 7), Merrilee was willing to hear any message of hope. He remembers few details from the sermon, but what spoke to him was Abadar’s commitment to civilization, taming the wilderness, and bringing thieves to justice (which in his head meant redemption, not the guillotine). 

Merrilee sought religious guidance, but which later would hold new meaning for Merrilee). He was also deeply moved by the sermons on dealing even-handedly with others, which put his feeble, one-line prayer in new perspective. 

After a time, making a case that he would be a good addition to the world. The warden bought it, and Merrilee walked out of the Monolith at dawn on a brisk spring day 
with naught but ragged clothing. 

Life was harder outside than Merrilee thought. He had become accustomed to regular meals and directed waking and sleeping hours. He had made bonds of friendship with those inside, and hungry. His usual charms failed to work on the citizens of Isarn, as his shaven head and ratty clothes painted him as a prisoner.  Despite their rhetoric, the Erastil monks would not take him in. Desperate, he turned to the only life he knew: thievery. But this time, it was different. Every theft was accompanied by guilt and the understanding that he was not dealing even-handedly with people. Every time he stole a potato to stave off hunger or a blanket to keep from freezing, he secretly donated labor to the owner

Despite this, because he refused to sell out his companions in questioning. He said he wanted to refrain from all stealing, however, and instead he’d man the camp and offer aid to wounded companions. But the need to belong soon broke his commitments to change. Slowly, he found himself back at his hold habits. First, he started fencing goods again (always with a heavy heart). He used his first profits to buy a lute. He spent his free hours teaching himself the notes and chords, determined to honor his promise to Yacques. Erastil seemed to smile upon his efforts

Then he started suiting up for jobs. It was all too much. Guilt racked him

One night, and fled, hiding in the bushes nearby. The passengers put up a fight, and it was bloody. Several of his friends died at the end of a sword; the rest fled. After the rout, the carriage failed to continue its movement down the road. He moved to investigate. His friends were lying there, lifeless. One gasped and twitched, but death was too close for his saving. Inside the carriage, breathing their final breaths. Their ward sat lifeless: an adolescent elven maiden in the finest dress. So delicate her frame. So undeserved her early death. He stared at her for minutes, ripped free in his rapid flight.

That night, then left after all were sleeping. Never again would he associate with these men. Never again would he allow his own weakness end in harm to innocent people. Erastil, the only truth he knew, would guide his way. He didn’t know his teachings, only what lore he had gleaned from the monastery and campfire tales, but it didn’t matter. Erastil was good and right. Word of new opportunity in the so-called Stolen Lands meant a fresh start in a frontier country, where no one would know his failings. Perhaps, he would be forgiven of all the evil he allowed happen. But could he ever forgive himself?

So, and not a single one had a combat-competent or viable character. The most fun I've had was my first campaign when I was an elf druid. I don't know if this was because he went easy on us, or because it was a druid -- I find them a lot less difficult to build and use. I spent many a fight moonwalking into the wall as an earth elemental, or tangling enemies with vines so that our fighter could mash them into a fine paste. Our GM at the time wouldn't reward us with gold too often, but I didn't care because I could turn into a bird and fly around. I was my favourite magic item and the character was bad-ass to boot.

But since then I've played a bard (Ugh. Not ugh that it's a bard, and currently have an inquisitor and rogue. I can't hit the broad side of a barn and combats have just become kind of a joke from my end. The less than polite members of my parties ridicule me for my uselessness, while the polite ones manage to not laugh as I consistently miss over and over again. 9/10 times I am not rolling sneak-attack because first of all, you can't do that if you can't hit, and secondly, I'm very squishy and maneuvering to flank usually puts my life at risk.

It's gotten to the point where I've asked my GM if I can sit combat out, and part of it is that we're lower levels, but generally I've come to hate combat in Pathfinder because I see no way to be decent at it, never mind good. For me, it has become a barrier that I always have to navigate around to get to the parts of the game I have any skill at or enjoy. Has anyone ever had a similar situation? Is this a funk that you eventually get over, or is this **supposed** to be a grueling process that isn't fun? Help.

EDIT: OK, just because, I'm getting new dice. Probably these GameScience ones that claim to roll truer. Normally I wouldn't be so inclined to believe claims about random accuracy and minor imperfections, but those videos someone posted about egg-shaped dice and low center of gravity on low numbers worries me based on my sub-standard rolling.

Secondly, I have unrealistic expectations about what my character can do. IE: The fighter is cleaving bad guys left and right. Why can't I do that? It's because he's a fighter and I'm not. I might reroll in the future and see how playing a full BAB class is, but for now I'm going to try and focus on what things can aid my party without me necessarily needing to be a high roller or deal as much damage as out front-line fighters.

But third, so the groups are largely the same people, but it's entirely possible that this might just not be a good match for me.

I've recently started DM'ing for a group of friends whom have not played many tabletop RPGs

Here's a little background:  
A player of mine has been tricked into signing a contract with a certain devil - Who has been following them (spying on them) and attempting to recruit the party to the devil's side.  

The player was interested in looking over the contract but when touching the scroll (which was barbed with metal spiked designed to trick interested parties into accidentally signing in blood.)  The devil took back the contract (now signed in blood.)  The devil has promised the character that he will have 'power' in trade for 'services rendered' and during his time in contract will not have to kill or harm any friends or loved ones.  

Here's my issue: 
The player has been expecting some sort of reward or boon for his ongoing 'loyalty' (as he calls it)  to the devils but so far but they have given him no plans, and all the d6 sneak attack damage which comes with it which to this player is everything.  However - I will be making the player take a level dip into Diabolist (Book of the damned Vol. 1 - Princes of Darkness).  I will be bending the rules on allowing this prestige class obviously and the player will be saying he is dipping into a sorcerer incase anyone in the party beings asking why he is casting spells.  However just so that I don't completely break his idea for his character for too long - The party will at some point in the near future be going back in time and across planes to kill the same devil that had this player sign the contract - At which point the player will be allowed to keep all items gained and in essence swap any levels gained for Rogue level's as if this little trouble has never actually happened.. 

I feel that looking ahead this is an 'okay' decision for a GM to make a character do - temporarily.  
The player feels wronged as if I am purposely nerfing his character. 

Is there any way that I can convince the player - or character that this is just something temporary without giving him too much player knowledge? I expect this devil's contract to last for 3-5 more sessions or for 1-3 more levels.

I love Fiasco, and other points don't add anything fun.)

For those of you who don't know/haven't heard of Fiasco the whole game is based on small time crime gone horribly, etc.) How you start the game is by sitting in a circle, and having a notecard between you and whoever is sitting next to you. You then roll to get the following:

Relationship with that person.

First you roll to see if you're romantic with them, etc.

The you roll to get the detail. ""Friendship... With Benefits!"" 

""Coworker...Professional Rivals""

Stuff like that.

You roll for motivation the same way. What is driving you?

""Need to get laid"" Need ""to get even""

""Need to get the Truth... About Someone's infidelity""

So here's what I'm thinking. We make a new couple of pages. I need 36 (or more if this takes off) different relationships for party members; and 36 different Motivations that can drive characters (not super epic

Reasons why I'm not just using Fiasco's book:

First: sex can make parties awkward in my experience

Second: It's very contemporary and not very magical-y. So some good brainstorming will definitely help with that.

1) I saw the post on some monk errata on the Paizo blog ( http://paizo.com/paizo/blog/v5748dyo5le61?Monkeying-Around ) Is there any more errata that is applied to the monk as written or is this the final form of the base monk?

3) Speaking of the cestus I thought I saw the listed damage as 1d3

4) When wielding a cestus or brass knuckles it says the language says that you are using unarmed strikes technically. In situations like Domain Strike where you get an ability via your unarmed strikes does a cestus prevent these abilities considering that It's possibly the weapon

Next, new gods, new kingdoms, and a new world. I want to give players the option to explore, discover, and expand, either involving themselves in pre-plotted elements or abandoning them to become masters of the wilderness and shattered dungeons and spires of a fallen civilization. I would strongly prefer to avoid significant use of miniatures in combat, or do people really play such ambitious campaigns regularly?**

---

Thanks!

Alright

The basic idea is an entirely original world (initially a single continent approximately the size of North America, that is that players could choose to ignore them entirely and they might go on of their own accord, for better or for worse), and a heavy emphasis--whether they follow the plot or not--on exploration of a depopulated world.

Set several decades after a cataclysmic event destroyed an enormous portion of the continent, this campaign focuses on players ""rediscovering the world."" While they do so, they can choose to explore the mysteries of the past--including the reasons for the cataclysm--and the present. They can unseat evil kings (or good ones!), rescue (or damn) peoples on the brink of extinction, stop (or help) power-mad villains, guide a fledgling race into the light (or stamp them out with an army), fight (or join) an invasion

They would do so using wholly original races (even humans will be differentiated by a few mandatory background choices) and tweaked classes (fewer tweaks here, and the history would be completely unique, and barring some pretty spectacular plane-shifting ludicrousness out of a high-level party, elements of the default setting would not enter into the campaign at any point.

I'd ideally love the campaign to alternate between plot-driven thriller and map-clearing hexcrawl (e.g., characters, cities, empires, polities, and ""world-events,"" along with the newly released *Ultimate Campaign* (plus maybe some elements liberally borrowed from *Kingmaker* and even the **Adventurer, King** system) guides to randomizing or dynamically generating world-content

Finally, miniatures, fully realized 3D to-scale dungeons, etc., I'd prefer to opt for less-tactical ""theater of the mind"" combat centered on concepts like ""at range, in close, engaged, etc."" I'm poor and a poor craftsman

1370113536.0,1fh6mm,Any advice on playing a blind character?,thedeadzed,21,3,22,"Despite everything I've read advising against playing a blind character

I am going to play as a blind Druid

I discovered the Pack Lord archetype

As per the rules regarding blindness, does not lose Dex bonus to AC, and does not take a -4 to Str and Dex based skills. 

All checks and activities that rely on vision still automatically fail, however, given that acrobatics is not a class skill, she would need to select a trait which provides access to acrobatics in order to avoid constantly falling prone.

One possible solution to the movement issue that we discussed is to have the Woodland Stride ability slightly modified, or having to move slowly.


Here is what I've worked out to help overcome blindness

One of the characters animal companions will be a mount

She will also memorize speak with animals on a daily basis and if she senses combat is imminent she will cast that in order to communicate clearly with her mount and help direct it in combat.

She will carry/use a quarter staff so that if she is on foot it can act as a 'white cane' but in combat it will be a shillelagh.


My biggest issue I've yet to think of a solution to is spellcasting.

Many spells require you to target an individual, but until then I'm thinking she will have to rely on melee combat, buff spells, and summoning spells.

Traveling Hobbit Hole
School conjuration (creation); Level cleric/oracle 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

CASTING
Casting Time 10 minutes
Components V, pressed into the target surface)

EFFECT
Range touch
Effect 10-ft.-square underground structure
Duration 2 hours/level (D)
Saving Throw none; Spell Resistance no


DESCRIPTION
You excavate a comfortable, or the spell fails. A mountain, large bolder, hillside or even flat ground will work, while water swampland, or loose sand will not. 

The floor is level, with a low 5' ceiling. The lodging resembles a normal halfling hole, with a sturdy door, two shuttered windows, and a cooking hearth (complete with cooking vessels, utensils, and a supply of firewood).

The shelter contains furnishings sized for a small creature - a comfortable down bed,  an armchair, and a writing desk.

I'm having some trouble with my local PFS Game Day organizer. I have been playing with him and several others for over a year, even if i haven't been. I have had a generally good relationship with him as a GM, player and event organizer. But with this ban now in place, I can't make it to other games in my area due to distance/transportation issues, and it feels like i have been left out in the cold.

Now since it usually helps you guys to know the whole story

2 weeks prior to today, whom is also the organizer. Let's call him M. M was great that day, keeping the game going, moving things along without railroading too much, generally doing a good job as GM. So the day ends, and its ~2130 or so. As i am packing up, the game already finished and most of the players departing or had done so already, let's call her A. A requested my help in procuring some medicinal-grade herbs for a mutual friend of ours. My phone's speaker was turned up so i could hear her better, but friends are friends you help them out

Now, i informed him that I was headed out to assist A. 
Here is where the crux of the problem stems, decided the reason for said ban: when he told me that not only was i to quit any involvement in such things, but that he regarded myself and my friend as immoral and despicable. I politely informed him that it wasn't any of his business, and that since i do not meddle in his private affairs outside of the gaming table, he should respect me enough to do the same. He told me that i should leave immediately, as he felt a moral obligation to summon the constabulary. I left, and i did not say many of the things i would have liked to say to him that evening. 
After i returned home, and that i hoped that it would not affect our gaming relationship. after 2 weeks, he replied, and said that i was banned from PFS play henceforth, and that he believes me to be immoral and depraved.

Now i KNOW this is a huge text block, as it has gotten quite murky and dark treading through this now treacherous swamp of morality and accusations. Before I take any formal action though, do any/all of you have any advice for me?

After fighting a group of zombies raised by a Thunderbird rider (who unfortunately escaped), but a 1 on my confirmation roll.  Our GM ruled that I hit and dealt damage, but my greatsword was lodged in his ribs. Halfling's turn followed mine, and he proceeded to finish it off with an Eldricht Blast.  Although it wasn't enough damage to harm my sword in any way, it was torn out of my hands and was flung into a puddle of nearby mud.  Angry, I demanded greater care and respect for the valuable heirloom of my tribe.  He responded derogatorily.  And I took exception to that. 

As the GM stood up to begin putting away the mat, and began grappling with him.  He failed his escape artist check, and on his turn he started to cast eldricht blast.  He had to make a concentration check, but since eldricht blast is a spell-like ability for him, his Concentration check to pull it off was amazingly easy; I believe all he had to do was roll higher than a four.

The gods must be kind

Having gotten the free pin, until the paladin finally noticed our struggles and intervened.  She made a plea to our party spirit, our communal struggle, but nothing worked till she threatened to dock my pay.  Suddenly ""coming to my senses,"" I picked up the poor little guy, wiped him down a bit, let him go.  By this time my friend playing the halfling was furious [see second edit], while at the same time promising a slow and agonizing vengeance someday

I wish to get the jump on this pretentious little OP as balls character.  As a warlock, oblique ways, I have a whole host of options, the first of which I would like to be Bestow Curse.  However, to out-sneak him, I want to apply the curse while he sleeps.  According to the pathfinder srd, an unconscious target is automatically counted as ""willing"" and forgoes his will save.  Will this wake him up?  And more importantly, but I can't find a ruling that says I cannot.  What would you GMs allow

Edit: Some words.

Second Edit: So a lot of you seem to think this is something to avoid entirely.  That my character is a ""psychopath"" and that I'm ruining the game for the other players.  I've made several replies about this, regardless of what goes on in game.  We're not going to break immersion, destroy old friendships, be so immature as to get tied up in this.  Everyone in the room had a good time playing this out or just watching from the sidelines.  Everyone.  Even the halfling's player, despite being ""furious"", privately told me he was having fun. We like variety, the unexpected, as of now our two characters are stuck in an antagonistic feud.  I've gotten a lot of great advice on how to proceed,False,

Over the course of 4 sessions they found a good lead

Here is my Dilemma. Well

1. When they catch and kill him

   When the man they seek is dead they'll have no motive to travel together anymore. They have all stated they are only together to catch him. And I don't want to force something upon them to make them stay as a party. I'm all about choice. This leads to my next question.

2. I know I could prolong the chase but I don't want it to be too cliche or 'scapegoatish'.

    I could just let him teleport away of something like that but that makes them feel like no matter what they do he'll get away. i just don't know how to keep it interesting. Since they have no moral standards and are only together for this man. Once he's gone I've got nothing.

So I'm playing around with a character of mine, taking the alternative trait). The penalties are harsh but I'm confident that the extra ability will trump boring +2s. Getting scent otherwise is rather expensive (you basically need to be barbarian with the right rage power, or half-orc/orc and take a feat... or the full-blooded Orcs can trade away their Ferocity and weapon proficiencies, yuck). There's also Alter Self to become an appropriate race that *has* scent but you need a piece of the original creature whose forms (and abilities) you are assuming.

So anyway. I'm thinking that there's got to be some reasoning why scent is one of those things that the normal adventuring party is not ""supposed"" to have easy access to

Uses that have already come up or seem obvious:

- Make tracking easier on hard surfaces (like a dungeon floor)  
- Thwart Alter Self and similar illusions
- Automatically detect invisible creatures within 30'  
- Identify spellcasters that use material components (ever smell bat guano and sulfur?)  
- Gunslingers and alchemists too

Ability Scores: +2 Dex +2 Wis -4 Int (-1 RP)

Bite (2x1 RP): Prerequisites: Small or larger size; Benefit: Members of this race gain a natural bite attack, etc.). The bite is a primary attack, or a secondary attack if the creature is wielding manufactured weapons. Special: This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, the bite damage increases by one size category.

Carrion Sense (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race have a natural ability to sniff out carrion. This functions like the scent ability

Weapon Familiarity (1 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Choose up to two weapons, all bows are considered one weapon. Special: This trait can be taken up to two times. The second time it is taken, the race becomes proficient with another two weapons or one weapon and a racial weapon group. (Simple and bladed weapons made of bone).

And I really like this one.
Frightful Gaze (Modified to Laugh)(6 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Members of this race gain the following supernatural ability: Creatures within 30 feet of a member of this race that meet its gaze must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 10 + the 1/2 user's character level + the user's Charisma modifier) or stand paralyzed in fear for 1 round. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A target that successfully saves cannot be affected by the user's frightful gaze for 24 hours.

Light Blindness (–2 RP): Prerequisite: Darkvision or see in darkness trait; Weakness: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds members of this race for 1 round; on subsequent rounds

Monstrous Humanoid 3
Ability scores: Weakness -1
Bite 2
Carrion Sense 1
Weapon Familiarity 1

We have 7 players at the table- our biggest issue seems to be time management. It can take upwards of 45 minutes to get back around to your turn with all the bad guys and other players (and their familiars or pets or summons). People lose interest and have no idea what is happening at the table by the time their turn does come up

Besides that- the amount of scaling I have had to do to the monsters presented in the book is kind of insane. Pretty much every one of my bad guys gets a +4 to their constitution and whatever their main stat is

I've had to keep the XP of these monsters the same to keep the party at the right pace for the books, not 4, so they pretty much demolish everything. I'm considering skipping several of the encounters in the next book to put them into harder territory earlier. I am also considering removing the availability of many magic items. Currently (at level 10) anything they have money for, they can buy- all items are available. It has made them pretty powerful. I don't think I want to scale it back down to what the book offers (A D3 of medium level magic items, or something else extreme), but I'm sure this would help slow them down- although HOLY CRAP will it piss off my players.

1 Pair of Draconic-ish Wings

So the group I usually play with was joking around about campaigns where everyone plays the same class (initially spurred by [this](http://i.imgur.com/V7XIS.png)), so I'm volunteering to run a medium-short (expecting roughly 6 sessions max) game on these rules.  I don't *think* any of my players are regular redditors, but if you do then you know we're planning this game and you know my username so stop reading here!  :P

Anyhow, that's very much the sort of vibe I'm going for here.  We're looking at 4 players now, but I might see if I can get a 5th.  The players are all starting at level 6, will probably hit 7 after two sessions, and finish out at 8 for the last two.  All Paizo-published feats/races/archetypes/etc. are allowed (the game is not going to be super-intensive and generally I'm the only min/maxer of the group so we should be fine).  They're allowed to multiclass, but at any given point at least half of their levels must be in Bard and they must have the maximum ranks possible in at least one Performance style.

The party is going to be an actual band

So the main meat of the game will be them flying their tour airship around to recover these instruments with a very soft time limit of ""before the show"" - their next big concert on the top of a volcano was scheduled at the last possible second before the loan sharks come to collect.  I'm not actually going to track or impose any kind of solid time limit

1.) The artifacts are going to be in individual little dungeons that the players can tackle in any order.  So the game will be narrow in focus, but do you think this could be an issue?  The players are all pretty chill so I think they'll be fine, but I could see it being annoying playing a game where everyone gets shiny new things and you're the very last to get one, thus also having the least total time to make use of it.

2.) Along the same lines

3.) Each dungeon is going to end in a similar way.  They have to open a vault with the power of their rocking - basically just a magical door that reacts to a specific type of Peformance.  The idea I have now for these seems a little...  Plain.  Basically the character whose instrument they're going for will have to sit out of a combat to simply concentrate entirely on performing until the door opens.  Meanwhile, they just don't gain one that turn.  Being attacked or otherwise distracted will obviously confer a penalty.  When they get a certain number, say 6 successes, the door opens and the monsters flee from the sheer metal they witness inside the vault and the encounter ends.  Does this sound good?  Is there a way to spice it up, maybe?  What the hell would the roadie do for his dungeon?

4.) Puns!  Any and all puns, and I like throwing in groan-worthy jokes otherwise.  Each dungeon is going to have thematic enemies like grunge golems or devilkin that literally ""throw the horns""...  All of the dungeons will be these elaborately decorated tombs dedicated to the musician, except the bassist's tomb has a giant pillar blocking the entrance from sight and instead of themed guardians it's just inhabited by some goblins slumming it because they didn't know who he was, jokes like that.

I'm toying around with the idea of making a melee combat-oriented sorcerer for a pathfinder campaign that will hopefully be starting up soon. I'm fairly familiar with 3.0/3.5 but don't have a ton of experience with Pathfinder. The core of the idea is to put my highest attribute scores into strength and charisma, and self-buffing spells to boost my melee-combat abilities. Stuff like *True Strike*, *Magic Weapon*, *Bull's Strength*, and *Heroism*. I'll likely be taking the ""Abyssal"" bloodline. Overall the idea is to be able to fight competently on the front lines while also having a few magic tricks up his sleeve (possibly some *Summon* spells?).

I've got the *basic* concept down

First off: Spell selection. I've got some of the basic ideas down for the lower levels (*True Strike*, *Bull's Strength*, *Invisibility*?, *Heroism*, *Rage*), but I'm interested in hearing people's suggestions, particularly for the higher-levels. I'm not interested in the ""blasty"" spells like *Shocking Grasp* and *Fireball*. My Charisma score probably won't be through the roof, which brings me to my next question...

To multiclass, this becomes a more appealing option. I might even pick up more levels of Barbarian later on.

Alternatively, more BAB, but less progression with the Abyssal bloodline powers. It seems like all I'm *really* interested in there is the bonus strength—the other stuff is *cool*, but maybe not necessary—so the Eldritch Knight levels seem like a solid bet.

1355995363.0,155s1q,So Our Drow Sorcerer Managed to Kill Millions of People  ,bmarquismarkail,31,18,59,"Hello

So we are doing a new campaign. Our GM this game was the paladin of the last game I posted. The players are thus:

A Changeling Rogue
A Tiefling Witch
A Drow Sorcerer(As explained in the title)
A Human Fighter
An Orc Fighter
And A Nagaji Fey Mystic Theruge (This guy!)

Fast forward to the scene. The Sorcerer was in a mage's edifice while the rest of the party went into a highly advanced kingdom led by a highly conditioned Elf Magus who worked on educating barbarians. So there are very strong

The mission is to incite any event that will cause the king to declare war to the other kingdoms.

When everyone was in the capitol, but with the advanced nature of this near-Utopian kingdom, he needn't  have to physically increase the space.

So the Drow got hold of this information, gave it to the crew, and simultaneously cast it.

This extradimensional spell is based on Rope Trick, the inhabitants on the edge of the field were simply dropped while everyone else in the extradimensional space will be shot at the speed of light. 

The inhabitants, if it wasn't for the impenetrable wall, we might not have to see the entrails throughout the kingdom's walls. The carnage was so immense, that no one couldn't  hold their stomachs unless you are a ruthlessly sadistic bastard (Like Drow in this campaign).

The GM was kinda pissed.

I never had the desire to tackle crafting in 3.5, during the jump between the last campaign and this one, the surviving characters spent a period of 2 years fighting in a large-scale war. An ambitious PC who took Craft Wondrous Item asked if he could use some of this time to craft, making a case that they wouldn't be in battle 100% of the war's duration, he could increase the DC to craft faster, and he has a ring that makes him require just two hours rest to feel refreshed.

I conceded these points and gave him a small portion of the two years for some crafting. He came back with a list of things he'd like to craft

1. I can't seem to wrap my head around the equations. I get the days worth of crafting per 1

2. Is Craft Wondrous Item strictly for preexisting book items, and frankly as the DM it's kinda scary.

3. If #2 *is* kosher

4. Can you take 10 on a craft check to avoid the potential failure?

2. Can the mount make a 5-foot step without cutting into my options for making standard and move actions (possibly for actual movement)?
3. Can the mount make a withdraw action? If it does

And to finish off we're going to go through a hypothetical series of actions. The worst has happened - an enemy beatstick has got into melee range of the caster-on-his-mount. The caster has no spells that he can reliably cast defensively *and* will remove the threat from the battle (or maybe he's flanked by two fighters so he can't just take out one). The low-level caster wants to get out of danger in one turn.

The caster defensively casts Fly on himself (it is assumed that he is confident that he will succeed). Then as a Move action he performs a Handle Animal check to command his mount to perform a Bull Rush... on himself (the caster)... aiming straight up.

By the rules as written, obviously). The caster, due to Fly, should have practically no effective weight (and be easy to move).

I've just begun playing Pathfinder with a bunch of friends. They're all old hands at playing RPGs and while I've always been interested in them, it was a lot of fun. I got to do what I love most in RPG/fantasy style games... Just cut everything to pieces with a big ol' greatsword and laugh while doing it. We've all written out character biographies (as you do!) and posted them to a shared google plus community where we plan everything. I posted mine the other day and our DM really dug it. He said I should post it here and see what you all think.

So, but, I haven't played enough and read enough to venture that I know -anything- substantial about it. So, forgive me if there are some glaring errors in this. As we go on playing and I learn more, I'll update it/change it/ret-con it as I see fit.

They always say the moon was red the night he was born.

O’ all the stories I’ve heard

A red moon, blood soaked glow. 

Some say he wasn’t true born, patched together by some of the darkest and most arcane magicks this world has ever seen. Tha’ some crazed Necromancer scoured the world, looking for the pieces of long dead heroes and warriors of legend, scavenging the corpses of the greatest champions to ever stalk the field of war. They say tha’ when the ritual was complete, he burst into life in a shower of blood, slaying the Necromancer and his familiars in an orgy of crimson soaked violence. They say he wasn’t born a child but tha’ he came into life as a full-grown man. 

Some say tha’.

Others reckon that the God of War himself

I even heard one ol’ geezer in a tavern years n’ years ago whispering into his cups one night that he swore he was there tha’ night. Says he saw a crimson scar open up in the night sky and tha’ Deskari himself slammed a hand down into the earth with the force o’ a thousand hammers. When Deskari took his hand away

I tell ya

They be right about the red moon

The southlands be full of nomadic tribes, warred with other folk. Normal folk, y’see. Thing about nomads is they don’t care much about what race ye be, only if ye can hold yer own and not slow anyone down. Ye can keep to yerself as much as ya like but ya gotta provide for the group.

Tha’s why Ranek be the half-elf bastard tha’ he is. His father was a man, or that she was a servant who ran away. Others reckon she was a drow, one o’ them who dwells in dark caverns and steals little children in the night. Some say a lot o’ things. Me? I don’t care about no she-elf bitch. She was his mother and he was her son.  Got that? 
An impure breeding if I ever heard o’ one. No good comes from mixing tha bloods and Ranek is a testament to tha’.

Eh?

Right

Trouble outside

Shouts rang out. They were attacked, quick as you like with a blade and not afraid to use ‘em. But these weren’t just any attackers. These were Knights, heavily armoured in full plate mail, wielding castle-forged steel and riding barbed chargers. Seems like the nomads had strayed too far into someone’s territory and were about to pay tha price for it.

It was a slaughter. Ranek’s father left his pregnant wife’s side to go join the fight, maybe a few minutes later, screaming as flames licked over his body, crossbow quarrels sticking out of his chest and legs. He died screaming, just as the baby was born, screaming, too. 

One o’ the Knights, legs splayed and a baby born. Ranek was still in the arms of a midwife when the Knight killed his mother with a single thrust of his spear. 

Somehow, on her knees right then and there. Others say she killed him, summoning up some motherly power and used a sword tha’ she would have never been able to wield normally and sliced the bugger’s head clean off. Some say it was both.

Me? I don’t care much. 

What I know is tha’ Ranek lived. Ranek was allowed to grow into the great big Barbarian bastard he is now. They say the midwife took him to the far north

They say a red moon follows him wherever he goes.

They do say tha’.

Always.

I'm really excited, its called Vancian magic because it is modeled after the magic system of a particular setting. I'm not playing in that setting, nor do I want to. The setting that I've been working on for over 5 years is high magic, and I expect that what sets PC's apart from other highly-skilled-but-mundane people of this world is magical characteristics... and I'm not talking about shit tons of stat-rific gear. The Mythic Adventures playtest by Paizo looks awesome, and I'll definitely be incorporating it into my game. However, I was curious if anyone here had any suggestions for balanced alternatives to the vancian magic system (besides the weird words of power system). I've seen a couple ideas for spell points or ""mana"" systems, which convert spells per day to points that are spent on any known spells (essentially making everyone a lot more sorcerer like). Anyone have any experience with that? Could it be balanced by other things? I personally like the idea of spells requiring a roll of some kind against an opposing defense. Magic may be common for PCs but it shouldn't be easy to execute, sanity

I get that I probably won't find much. Most people just seem to say ""refluff psionics. done."" But I'm curious, or even a cleric (with power lists for domains and keeping some of the iconic class features). Is there any rule to substitute powers known/ power points per day progression for spells known/ spells per day progression?

The Synopsis:
The group, Sharn Willowstrike, and Zint Albatross, met on the road at the sight of a burned wagon.  Thakk pulled a burning crate from the wagon before the flames consumed it for Sharn, who discovered fine silks and a false bottom inside.  In the hidden space, Sharn found 4 pouches of bloodweed, a controlled substance that the dragonkin are addicted to

The group kept the box and made their way down the road, owned by Hod and his wife.  A display of magic from Gasbode forgave any cost of staying at the inn, though the wizard still offered aid, should the owners need it.  

Hod told the adventurers of a group of brutes that, not settling their debts, and destroying property.  The adventurers agreed to help Hod that night and went to sleep, planning to wake up in time for the ruckus after dark.

Several hours later

After a short panic, agreed, but posted guards at the front and back of the inn.  

After some deliberation, volunteering the both of them for arrest so they could get to the bottom of the problem.  

While Gaspode and Thakk were escorted to the barracks, causing enough noise for the guard around the corner to investigate.  Zint ran behind a shop across the street, while Sharn climbed down the window, threw the crate into the stables, and allowed himself to be arrested.  

Back at the barracks, of attacking a caravan, setting fire to it, and stealing a box from it.  While there, Rifen al'Athax, a red scaled Dragonborn noble, revealed himself

Sharn was brought in and Captain Slynt sent out more guards to find the fourth member of the group as well as the missing crate.  During this time, however, and so Thakk, Gaspode, and Sharn were at the mercy of the guards finding Zint and the box.  

Zint had, hidden it in the alley behind the shop he had fled to, and asked the shopkeeper to hide him.  

Hours passed and neither appeared and Captain Slynt had no choice but to let the three go.  The three released captives left the barracks and made their way back to the inn

Back at the inn

Time ticked by and the sun set before Hod arrived and told them the thugs had arrived.  One at a time, and Gaspode made their way to the common room, placing themselves around the four troublemakers, who had taken to a game of dice.  

The night wore on and the dicers grew drunker and drunker, he grabbed Hod's wife and attempted to make her sit on his lap.  She managed to get away, but Thakk knew that was it.

After missing in his first attempt to get their attention

In an instant, and Sharn had managed to bury her longsword in the chest of a third, by way of his neck.  

Zint, begging forgiveness.  

Reunited

Realizing it was high time for them to be on the road, thanked the cigar-maker that had hid Zint, and started to make their way into the wilderness.

2) You can't take improved natural weapon to up your Unarmed Strike. 

3) what hurt the most was that the Brass Knuckles were errata-ed to not use the Monk's unarmed strike damage. This takes away the monk's ability to enchant their unarmed strike.

My friends and I have just moved on from the beginner's box, i attempt to consult the rulebook, but it can be very difficult to navigate. Most of the time we end up having to stop playing for 5-10 minutes as one of the brings out the laptop and google searches a rule or mechanic. The only time things seem to go smoothly is in combat - and that is only until someone tries to deviate from standard attacks, then we have to work out the logistics of a spell or ability. 


Is there anyway to get this moving smoother? It seems like there are way too many rules to keep track to the point that it becomes less of a game

how often can a player heal? 

can players move past each other if they are in a hallway only a block wide? 

how long is a day? 

what determines if you can jump over a space? 

can you aim at certain parts of the body and

when, or can they walk into a room and request to do a check?

These are only a few

As the GM, and it seemed really epic and fun. Ours is like a mediocre slide show, and feels like a cheap board game rather than an immersible story. 

I also ran into various issues in portraying the story. In the adventure book it gives little subtext to me things like what a villain they are fighting likes, then i am unsure how to convey these things. In a room with only the villain, how am i to portray that he is a salty bitter old sailor? i'm new to the whole role-playing thing, so my portrayals of the NPCs are often stilted and uncomfortable.

I really just want to wrap up this portion of the story.

I'm sorry if that wasn't clear in my initial whining

______________________________________________

A few things for him.

1, so he's going to be in evidence with his combat loadout and that's pretty much it (how many pockets for random jargon is there on his suit?).

2, and firearms), so both of the only two approximate existing classes that would fit would need a retrofit. For future reference, those 2 classes from what I can find (if there's extra stuff I'm not considering, let me know) are the Psionic Warrior and the Shroud archetype of Marksman. Those are http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/psychic-warrior and http://www.d20pfsrd.com/psionics-unleashed/classes/marksman/archetypes/dreamscarred-press/shroud respectively. The first would need to be modified to be more of a stealth class than a Fighter class like it is, and the second would need at least a stealthy Combat Style.

3, but not impossible (gun has armor penetration, does decent damage but can't be fired more than once a round even with FRA). The real problem would be the psionics from Starcraft. Several of his passive abilities could be translated to something similar to a psionic tattoo that doesn't dissipate (Spectres are supersoldiers, their origin government is willing to pay for quality), but what about something like Psionic Lash, or even Consumption?

Any thoughts on making this big lug a PF character would be greatly appreciated. Aside from the fun that would be playing this guy in a fight, he comes across as the kind of guy to go running towards screaming on instinct. A potentially fun dichotomy to play. His screwy relationship with Nova should also be a fun hook to yank on for any inventive DM.

**Warforged**

**+2 to One Ability Score:** Warforged characters get a +2 bonus to one ability score of their choice at creation to represent their creator's purpose. 

**Varied Size:** At 1st level, a -1 penalty to their Combat Maneuver Bonus and Combat Maneuver Defense, and a +4 size bonus on Stealth checks. Medium
creatures have no bonuses or penalties due to their size.

**Varied Speed:** A Small Warforged has a base speed of 20 feet. A Medium Warforged has a base speed of 30 feet.

**Warforged Immunities:** Warforged are immune to sleep effects, and gain a +4 racial bonus on saving throws against such effects. 

**Cyborg:** Warforged count as both Humanoid and Construct-type creatures for any effect that targets living creatures or constructs.

**Semi-organic:** Warforged only receive half the bonus from all heal effects (rounded down, such as *mending* or *make whole*, can also heal a Warforged but they receive only half the bonus from such effects (rounded down, minimum 1). A character can use the Craft (Construct) skill on a Warforged like they would the Heal skill on Humanoid creatures. Warforged may also benefit from the Heal skill.

**Built for Battle:** Warforged receive Toughness as a bonus feat at 1st level.

**Unnatural Presence:** Warforged receive a +2 racial bonus on Intimidate checks made against non-Warforged creatures.

**Bloodless:** Warforged are immune to bleeding. In addition

**Always Armored:** Warforged are treated as always wearing light armor for the purpose of spells, and have a 5% Arcane Spell Failure Chance.

**Woodforged:** At 1st level, and receives none of the bonuses or penalties. Instead, it receives a +2 bonus to Stealth when hiding in a wooded area or among wood.  In addition, it is considered combustible for the purpose of spells and effects.


EDIT: Unlisted negatives of being a warforged include poor healing rate and weakness to Electricity or Fire damage. A Woodforged is significantly more vulnerable than a Warforged since any stray fire could potentially kill it. A Warforged is restricted to certain classes since Monk, and it takes double Electricity damage, but this might not be a big enough weakness to balance a Warforged out.

EDIT 2: Took out the Energy Drain immunity. It seems pointless if they could be fatigued and exhausted but not energy drainable. Added Small Size option.

EDIT 3: Re-worded Semi-organic to match the appropriate wording

EDIT 4: Updated Semi-organic and Warforged Immunities to reflect their Humanoid-Construct nature.

&gt; (optional backstory below)

The idea is that the main heroes failed in their mission to defeat a great enemy. As a precaution, a spell would awaken the Warforged and fight to avenge the heroes.

I decided I wanted to share an idea that popped up in my mind yesterday (before I read the post - pure coincidence there) and hopefully receive some feedback. I made a new self-post

Here's the general outline:

Players start with blank, I will allow them to add some very basic feats or abilities (i.e. weapon proficiencies, cantrips of some kind, class skills)
Everything else has to be earned through role-playing.

Before a session, by allowing them to add feats, skill(ranks), class abilities or an ability score increase.

Why do I want to try this? Because, but I want to take it a step further.

I realise this is basically allowing players to create their own classes, in accordance to how they role-played their character. This, along with the gradual character advancement, is what I think I will like best.

I will probably have to analyse all the classes and assign value points to their abilities so I have some sort of guideline to rule by. Alternatively, while still requiring them to justify their choices. Also, I will still hand out experience points to keep track of overall character advancement. A lot of abilities will require a minimum XP (no 9th level spells during the 9th session). Maybe I can even ""fix"" the 'linear warrior, quadratic wizard' syndrome this way.

First off, which gave me an additional 2-4 sneak attacks out of probably close to 50 attack rolls if not more.

My initial idea was she was going to be an adopted half-elf of a human Sandpoint family. Then I would take the Adopted trait and Family Ties from the Rise of the Runelords player guide.

Her adopted father would be a craftsman that taught her his skills now she's a bowyer and weapon crafter. She's made her own bow and practices when she's not crafting.

We're almost done with the first chapter of RotRL and the idea was at the end of this chapter the current adventurers would disperse and then a month or two (in game time) would elapse and a new group would need to come to help the town. My thoughts were when the original adventurers didn't come (because we're all rolling new characters) she would step up and help defend the town.

But I'm curious about a few things. Why did she step up now? I'm iffy on her fitting into the town or not. She's got a low charisma so she probably wouldn't fit in so why step up?

I do want her to be chaotic good. I want her to help others based on what she thinks is right. 

I want her skills to fit into her backstory also. If I didn't make her a crafter what about a traveler. Not necessarily an adventurer but someone that could step up to help. So maybe ride and climb

**Background:** We're part way through the second book of a kingmaker campaign. My old character was a halfling bard (archivist) ""archaeologist""

What I went with was a Human cavalier (Order of the Cockatrice). STR 18, INT 10, WIS 8, CHA 14. For feats I went Mounted Combat, Ride-By-Attack, Spirited Charge, Wheeling Charge, Precise Strike (teamwork).

I think this is where the issue comes in. The rest of the party isn't super min-maxed. I'd say they're doing around 13-20 damage per turn on average. My cavalier

I guess it's silly to deny that my character is pretty min-maxed. It's not as min-maxed as I could possibly make it, so my damage can keep up with the min-maxy fighter (who people grumble about a bit as it is). The open terrain means that it's rare his mount can't be brought to bear. And every one of his feats is geared towards grinding as much benefit out of that advantage as possible.

The players got a hint from a shopkeeper they know that he'd pay their weight in gold for a specific Shoanti artifact if they'd deliver it to him. After that the players encountered a group of Shoanti from the Shundar-Quah tribe who asked for the same artifact

Long story short

This is the part I need ideas and help for. I've got some notes with no cohesive plot:

The players need to convince leaders of Shoanti tribes that they're worthy of pursuing the quest further. Perhaps with trials of some sort

The skull is a clockwork item used to open the dungeon of a great Shoanti leader from the times of the Runelords.

The dungeon itself is either a grave or a jail. I haven't really decided yet. One solution would be to have the Great Leader be in some kind of stasis
Another would be to have him be dead

In the dungeon the first levels before the skull-locked door would be just generic desert dwelling monsters appropriate for the player levels.

For the finale I thought Terracotta Soldiers would be appropriate. Maybe accompanied/led by a bigger monster of some sort - or the Great Leader him/herself undead or alive.

He has a background as an assassin (but because I don't fancy the prestige class over base Rogue I'm full rogue). 

I'm not sure what traits would fit him

Also

For personal and flavor reasons he's dual wielding War Razors (Runelords campaign so avoid spoilers please). ",self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1hy1no/rogue_traits_and_other_questions_about_playing_a/

Was just curious as to whether anyone else has encountered a similar situation or if they know the exact rules pertaining to this situation. My character is now dead and I hold no resentment over the fact because he went out in true Paladin fashion but just wanted to see for future games what the ruling would be.

P.S. NPC that I sacrificed myself for ended up dying next turn because none of my party decided to try to help him and enemy did another coup de grace :(",self,t5_2trms,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Pathfinder_RPG/comments/1hvbq9/question_on_paladins_sacrifice_spell_and_coup_de/

1372600113.0,1hd4a0,Can you help me out with this concept? Fearsome Whirlwind Whip Thug Fighter,Askray184,13,1,8,"Hit everything within 15' (30' enlarged) with a Whirlwind attack dealing nonlethal damage

Half-Orc
City Raised - Proficiency with Longsword and Whip instead of Weapon Familiarity

Feats:

Level 1 - Dodge

Fighter 1 - Mobility

Fighter 2 - Spring Attack (Retrain at level 4)

Level 3 - Combat Expertise

Fighter 4 - Whirlwind

Level 5 - Enforcer

Thug 1(lvl5) - Enemies shaken by Demoralize for more than 4 rounds become Frightened

Thug 2(lvl6) - Evasion

Level 7

And... I guess I'll go into two-weapon fighting or power attacking here for when we're fighting fewer enemies.  Scorpion Whips and Whip Mastery are pretty good for getting around all the downsides of whips.  Alternatively

If I took Lore Warden

The build's crazy feat-intensive (so much so that I don't know if I could even do the TWF chain after this), and provide support fire/debuffing/combat maneuvers from the back line.  I'm thinking this build is more like a 5th member than the front line fighter.

I would guess that the summons would be like the normal monsters except with the Construct template, and perhaps replace some of the abilities the Summoner gets with Item Creation feats or some sort of bonus to item creation.

I realize a lot of these modifications might make this version slightly more(or in some cases less) powerful than the regular Summoner.
