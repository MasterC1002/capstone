These are a few rules of thumb in regards to physics.

* A rigidbody is simply something that tells the physics engine to watch this object.

* A collider is something that tells the physics engine where an object should collide with other objects. If the collider is a trigger, the physics engine will handle collision response appropriately.
* If you want collision on something it needs a collider. If this collider should move it **MUST** have a rigidbody.
* if you want 100% fine control over that rigidbody (say, and you should manipulate it with rigidbody.MovePosition() and rigidbody.MoveRotation(). Never **EVER** use the transform to move physics objects. Thats like sticking a fork into a toaster, scrambling it around and expecting the toaster to deliver toast :)


* If you want to collide with objects that does never move (obstacles, but not a rigidbody. This tells the physics engine that these objects will never move, and they are ignored when it does collision calculations (BOOM! you just saved compuation time for the fancy effects stuff)


* If you want more realistic motion with a physics object, if you adjust the drag settings correctly.
* if you are moving a rigibody over several frames, because Update is not run at a fixed interval. It runs as fast as it can (in most cases)


* If things are still moving through walls,,False,self,t5_2qwj8,1368638539.0,,True

I built an accompanying Unity project which includes six different Editor scripts that implement a variety of different tools

* A custom component inspector
* A multi-object material applicator

I've been working on side project for a while and wondered if there would be any interest in a possible Asset Store release.  
  
First
(Updated 07/20/2013 - Now includes obstruction textures
  
It is a dynamic water system designed with Unity Indie. The water surface is a high-poly plane mesh that is modified at runtime. It allows basic user interaction, and buoyant objects. The simulation algorithm is based off of the Tessendorf Papers on Interactive Water Surfaces. The buoyancy is derived from the voxel-based buoyancy from the community ocean project.  
  
As it uses Unity Indie, but not quite there yet.
  
What would be a good price for something like this? Maybe $15-25? (UPDATE: Leaning more towards the $30 mark)  
  
EDIT: I get around 400-500 fps on my rig (i5-2500k @ 4.5
  
EDIT 2: By the way, reset all to defaults, set the Input Damping to 1, and draw on the surface. The input deformation becomes ""permanent"", at least until you lower the damping value below 1 again. I just thought that was cool :)  
  
EDIT 3: For those curious, and player camo (in the Character Example) are all Substances from the 18 Free Substances package. The other materials are just basic Bumped Specular. The Substances are what mainly contributed to the web demo being only 1MB in size, the deck planks used to be 1024x1024 diffuse &amp; normal textures, now they take up about 8kb  :)

So I was wondering if I could list some things and people could add to the list

1. The GetComponent function of an already found GameObject.  (for instance

2.  Does scale effect efficiency (for instance the difference between the same transform being scaled to 0.001

3. How do game objects that are currently disabled effect efficiency?  Let's say I have 1000 disabled game objects.

4. Coroutine WaitForSecond: does length effect cost?  Does it matter if I wait for 100000 seconds or 1 second (assuming that nothing is running alongside either of them)?

5. Several different animations running simultaneously.

6. Length/amount of curves within a single animation.

[EDIT] Added:

7.How does a SendMessage() on a known GameObject compare to GetComponent&lt;IntendedScript&gt;() and a function call?

This is just a list to get started.  Please feel free to add your own in the comments and I will add them to the list!

**The story behind Futile:**

I come from a background using Flash and Cocos2D, but I just wanted something simple that could be used 100% from code, like all the platforms I was used to.

So I finally bit the bullet, and it ended up working really well. It was meant to be just a personal thing, but I casually mentioned it on Twitter and a bunch of people seemed to be interested, so I decided I'd make it a bit more presentable and release it.

It does a lot of neat stuff behind the scenes

Stuff like: 

    FContainer container = new FContainer();
    container.rotation = 90;
    container.x = -50;
    FEngine.stage.AddChild(container);
    
    FSprite banana = new FSprite(""Banana.png"");
    banana.x = 10;
    banana.y = 100;
    banana.scaleX = 1.5f;
    banana.alpha = 0.5f;
    
    container.AddChild(banana);

It's still in development and basically completely undocumented

I have a few good ideas where this could end up but for now I'm going to post what I do have working and see what you guys/gals think. 

Project Contents

 * WaterBobbing - C# script controlling water bobbing.
 * EffectBigSplash - JS script causes a reaction with trigger to cause splash

Scene Contents

 * Buoy - Cube under the water causes the bobbing action. 
 * FallingCube - The cube that falls into the water (holds the water effect)
 * TriggerBigSplash - is a cube trigger that causes the water splash reaction

The Scene when you press play will show a cube fall into the water it will then have a splash effect and it is dissipate. the cube will then be bobbing up and down in the water for the rest of the scene the bobbing action is caused by the lower cube ""Buoy"" interpolating between 2 points on the y axis the script is easy enough to follow if you read the comments. 

The way i see this project moving forward would be boat physics and i have the basics here ill break down what need to be done and see if you guys/gals have any other ideas. You have a boat the ""Buoy"" from the scene would be the shape of a ships hull and without a mesh render-er then have triggers in the water causing the wave response like on the rotational axis. 

I hope this help's you if your using Unity Free as with unity pro you have access to buoyancy control

**NOTES**

I'm trying to compile a list of the best paid and free options for 2D game development on Unity. So far these are the ones I've collected from tutorials and the asset store. What I'd like to get is more feedback from the community that uses these things as to what their strengths and weaknesses are

Add'l comments: Some of these are on sale in the March Madness sale

The Google Doc is set to let people leave comments on items. I can change it to open editing if people are interested/think it would work.

[Direct link to Android APK](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater.apk)

Some keynotes:

* Compatible with Unity 3.5.7 - 4.2.

* Designed to run as fast as possible on any possible hardware using only Unity Free. As a downside

* Tested to work on Android. It actually shows quite good performance - Motorola Droid 2 runs a 64x64 grid with some buoyant objects at 50 FPS. I'm sure it will run on iOS without problems as well.

* Contains a powerful feature that can increase performance drastically (up to 6x in some cases). Especially useful for low-performance hardware such as found mobile in devices. The caveat is some possible quality degradation

* Supports static obstruction geometry for achieving non-rectangular shapes. All collider types are supported.

* Buoyancy simulation system is made to be totally separable from water simulation. In fact

* Allows setting multiple ""splash zones"" on a single water instance (see Waterfall demo).

* User-friendly editor interface.

* Code is written in a way that allows extending the asset for your needs easily. See [docs](http://docs.zimm.biz/dynamicwater/) (Docs are in early state now


Demos include two scenes that are optimized for mobile. (Note that Waterfall scene is not optimized for mobile in *any* way and will most certainly lag *a lot*)

It has already been submitted to the Asset Store a few days ago

The battle still wages on! Here are a couple updates from what we've learned so far:

**Web Interface**

* Background on the web interface needs to be slowed down
* It's confusing on how to get into the game via the web interface
* The screen aspect ratio for the web interface is causing some issue for some users
* We need a gameplay video / explanation 
* Creating a new character for private accounts is broken

**Game Client**

* Laggy for people who are geographically further away from the sever (hosted in Portland
* Trouble getting out of the south base (go through the back door facing south)
* When a player dies
* You can shoot / kill yourself
* You can fall off the edge of the map and not respawn
* You can't hear the other persons gun or bullets (silent death)
* Hurt indicators are all the noticeable / too fast

Anything we missed? Let us know what you think!

I've been using this for a while

You can easily create dialogue scripts with branching logic, currency, inventory, and manipulate these in dialogue (e.g. player chooses yes or no to a quest and a key is set accordingly. Player speaks to an NPC more than once, set a key. NPC gives player an item, set a key).

You can basically make an entire RPG with little more than this plugin. And the latest version comes with an NGUI example.

So yeah it's pretty good. Worth checking out.

I just wanted to take a second to show you the labours of my last 18 months within Unity

As a solo developer, as well as the hardest and most emotionally draining; being semi-autobiographical in nature, there is a lot of 'me' in this chilling story.

I am now coming to the end of the development and just have the Oculus support to implement... i can then take a well earned breather.

In an attempt to get Montague's Mount out to the most people possible, check it out and 'give me the thumbs up', your support would be very well received.

It can also serve as a good introduction to unity for some beginner. I tried to explain the processes step by step so it should be pretty easy to grasp. Full code source is available on Part 3(which will probably be edited because it's pretty simple as of now).

**Heart of Stone**

David Stone crossed the wrong guy.  He's been shot, so he'll have to muster his last ounce of strength to save her.

*Heart of Stone* is a stealth adventure game, you'll double over in pain, unable to move for a while.  Can David Stone save his daughter, or is she as doomed as he is?

**Check it out**

[Play it online](http://www.barkingdoginteractive.com/heartofstone/)

[Image gallery](http://imgur.com/a/0Efa8)

Use the arrow keys to move.  You may have to click on the game to give it focus if the keys don't seem to be working.  *Try to move slowly* - if you over-exert yourself

**Postmortem**

The game was built by one person, models, and coding were original for the game jam; music and sound effects were pre-existing assets.

*What went right*

Unity.  I wouldn't have been able to make a game like this in such a short time span without it.  In addition to the 3D engine drastically cutting the effort required to get images on the screen

Simple graphics.  I'm really happy with the visual style of the game, feel more expressive than if I had tried to put more detail into them, and it made the graphics reasonable to produce in the constrained time frame.

Simplified AI.  The guards' AI seems a lot more sophisticated than it really is.  The AI is ""pre-trained"" by having set waypoints for their sentry behavior

*What went wrong*

Doing it by myself.  This is the first time I couldn't participate directly in the game jam but tried to make a game anyway.  No teammates means you have to drastically cut back what you can do.  Also

Baking the AI for the guards.  About halfway through production, the daughter you're trying to save.  I had to go back and re-engineer how I did a few things to make it work for her, so that she wouldn't blast her father as soon as he came into her line of sight.  Separate out your components, people!

The Blood.  Currently, so if this weren't a game jam, I'd be writing an object to ""collapse"" all the blood drops into a single mesh.  Sadly, I didn't have time to do that, so I had to rely on players just getting through the levels (or dying) fast enough that it doesn't become an issue.  That, in turn, meant scaling back the amount of blood that shows on the floor, that's a net loss

Unsatisfying end scene.  I'd hoped to get something a little more satisfying in place for the end scene if you manage to save the daughter.  Didn't have time to implement it

There are also a few *tiny* visual glitches that I didn't have time to address.  Overall

Hope you enjoy the game!  If you have any questions

1351974896.0,12kv6d,Trying to learn Unity. What is your typical workflow/setup?,altermicro0181,21,5,18,"I have decent experience with programming

I’m going to use a simple analogy I just used with my wife to explain the problem I’m having. I had her tell me how she goes shopping. She makes a list, she goes shopping. I had her break down various parts: how do you make a list? You check what’s in the cupboard, you see what we’re missing. And there’s catches as well. You want to get *heavy* stuff last, so you’re not carting it around the whole time. If you know from your shopping list that you only have a few light things, you might grab a basket instead of a cart. That sort of thing.

So I’m looking for a breakdown of a typical workflow, as well as a few catches I might be looking for. Even if I don’t know what a shopping cart *is*, I know that I’m looking for one and I know I need one *before* I put things in the cart. I need to know what I’m looking for. Similarly, in photoshop it’s a good idea to put a layer mask around an object to mask out the background rather than deleting it, because if you need to make changes later on with a deleted background you would have to start over from scratch. So a layer mask is like getting heavy stuff last. It saves me time/effort knowing ahead of time to watch for something simple like this.

**tl;dr: I don’t know where to start and how to proceed. What’s your typical workflow like? Mention as many key terms/functions as possible so I can look those up and learn about them.**

* Simply click the white squares that are attacking you to kill them.

* As you kill the enemies will spawn faster.

* If you miss a click it will start your streak back at one and reset the multiplier.

* Enemies spawn faster and faster starting at 10 kills then every time you double that.  So 10 - 20 - 40 - 80 - 160 (this is where it starts to get interesting) - 320 - 640(the last time it speeds up).

After buggering about with XNA from time to time it seems like Unity is the thing I've been waiting for all my life. I have a couple of questions though:

1) in my game you may notice there's a white point light illuminating the player ship and its surroundings. When you thrust (lol 'thrust') it turns on an orange spotlight to represent exhaust (more obvious in other unpublished sections of the game). On the web player this causes the white point light to turn off. On the desktop it doesn't. Are there any limitations of the web player that would explain this?

2) I'm assuming that a build only incorporates assets that are used in each scene

3) Not a question but a big thanks to Drakfyre for his excellent Cooking With Unity video tutorials. My sidescroller keeps the player stationary and moves the environment (I think his did the opposite)

I just finished a lander game written in Unity.  It has a 2D aesthetic.  The game is very hard
1) the ship is top heavy so balance is key (like flying a broom by the handle)
2) the ship has suspension and a joint in the middle which gives it a very unique bouncy feel.

Why I like made this game:
  I always loved flying the helicopters in Battlefield 2.  It is very hard to learn to fly those beasts, terrified passengers, I wasn't content just flying high and letting my passengers shoot from a distance.  I liked to get into the thick of it, buzzing between buildings, and strafing capture points, pushing my flying skills to the limit.  
  To me, you don't ride it to get around, you ride it for the thrill of overcoming the difficulty.

I just wanted to note that I see a lot of posts where beginner and intermediate Unity3d users will have a problem with their game, but is very far from an optimal (Or even easy) solution.  When they end up posting a question, the question is about the tree they are barking up, not the base problem.

While it's potentially helpful to be specific about what you are trying to get the scripting system/animation system/gameobjects/other components to do

**tl;dr Please tell us what is broken with your GAME along with what you THINK is broken with your scripts.**

Additionally:

* Pictures are worth 1000 words

* A playable demo is worth even more words than a picture.  Set up a scenario that shows the problem and make a web build so that we can see what's happening.  In this case you'll need hosting; [Dropbox](http://www.dropbox.com/) is very good for setting up public links to Unity3d and is free for a certain amount of space and bandwidth.  If you have your own servers for hosting files/http

* Be open with your code/assets.  If you are comfortable sharing your project files, whether you register them or not (You do not even technically have to place a copyright notice, though it costs you nothing and you probably should).  We are not here to steal game ideas or code or assets, and publishing your partially finished works here gives you more of a trail of ownership.

This is the first game I've done in a while

The idea is to avoid enemies

You move with the arrow keys and double tapping will get you a speed boost in that direction.
As you pick up pellets it will grow the bomb they are attached to. Anything inside the blast radius will explode when the bomb is picked up and any bomb inside the blast radius will also explode. Any enemy inside the explosion will be destroyed and the more enemies you destroy the more points you get per enemy.

Un-exploded bombs also produce certain effects if enemies or the player go inside the blast radius

Red: Player moves faster

Green

Blue: enemies are repelled

Giving away a bit of code I've been working on over the last few days. It a bit of procedural terrain generation code for a 2D platformer. 

Attached below is a package containing a procedurally generated mesh that acts as a terrain. Well two meshes actually. The script attached to the ""Plane Mesh"" game object generates a mesh based off an equation and applies a mesh collider

http://imgur.com/a/U4QC5#ohNRUrz

This code is a bastardised ""Heightmap Generator"" example that Unity released.

There is a problem tho that I haven't been able to fix (hence the giveaway) and that is at high downwards velocities (anything roughly over a velocity of 25 m/sec) the mesh collider fails and my sphere falls through the mesh. Strangely if you hit horizontally at high speed it doesn't seem to have this problem.

I've learned a lot working this problem through

Couple of notes

Also another thing to keep an eye out if you start changing this for your own project

edit: I've thought of a solution using a raycast straight down and checking if the length of the ray is below a  threshold (the diameter of the sphere in this case) but its late here and I need to sleep. I'll probably give it a crack later on and see what happens.

I'm excited to say that **Dynamic Water System** asset is finally available on Asset Store!

This is a custom dynamic water physics simulation system designed for Unity Free. Water simulation is achieved by running a wave simulation algorithm and applying it to a high-poly mesh. While this is not a full-scale ocean simulation package, fountains etc. Also includes a nice realistic voxel-based buoyancy system.

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;**[Asset Store link](http://u3d.as/content/lost-polygon/dynamic-water-system/)**


**Links to the demos:**

[Webplayer demo](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/)

[Direct link to Windows version](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater_PC.zip)

[Direct link to Android APK](http://docs.zimm.biz/demo/dynamicwater/DynamicWater.apk)

**Features:**

* Compatible with Unity 3.5.7 - 4.2.

* Designed to run as fast as possible on any possible hardware using only Unity Free. As a downside

* Tested to work on Android. It actually shows quite good performance - Motorola Droid 2 runs a 64x64 grid with some buoyant objects at 50 FPS. I'm sure it will run on iOS without problems as well.

* Contains a powerful feature that can increase performance drastically (up to 6x in some cases). Especially useful for low-performance hardware such as found mobile in devices. The caveat is some possible quality degradation

* Supports static obstruction geometry for achieving non-rectangular shapes. All collider types are supported.

* Buoyancy simulation system is made to be totally separable from water simulation. In fact

I decided to go back to University (I was 24 at the time and only had a degree in lighting effects

I have been a gamer my whole life, etc. Problem is I never finished anything. When it's a contract I do for my father developing a program it's easy to finish. You're bound by a contract and you're getting paid at the end. But for my own projects, I can never seem to make it, even if I really love doing it. 

So here it is

So I started watching tutorials

I don't have a title yet, ressource management game with a couple of elements thrown in. For example you can eventually have multiple cities connected with trade routes (not on the same map like in Anno, think offline Sim City), You can send explorers to far away lands and if they return they'll bring back exotic food, new architecture, new ressources, perhaps a trade request and so on. 

As things are now there will not be any combat. One of my influence is The Guild 2 and Majesty. I don't want the player to have actual Control over the population. You'll place buildings, watching your people fight while you helplessly watch them is not a good experience. 

I'm very sorry for the extremely long post

I just want somebody to give me something.. (this is good

You can check out a quick gameplay video over here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZggvugkjYiM

I slowly started out building Zenzizenzic at the end of 2012, besides 15-20 years or so of playing games. During this trek I actually dropped by here in the Unity3D subreddit before a few months back (http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/193eju/the_very_first_result_of_my_experiences_with_game/), got an awesome response, and now finally I'm able to present you an early playable test version which you can give a whirl yourself.

1368374230.0,1e6rf8,How would I destroy an object when the player looks away from it?,Simerty,18,3,8,"EDIT: Problem was solved by /u/aDFP 

Basically the solution was to scrap the Instantiate/destroy idea and include the outline as a child object on the cube and just enable/disable it. See below for the code.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


I have some basic cubes. When the player looks at a cube I instantiate a dark cube frame around the cube to kind of outline the cube so the player can see which cube exactly he/she is looking at.

I make sure the outline is only instantiated once by using a raycast and only instantiating the outline when the object the raycast hit changes.

The problem I'm having is how to destroy the outline object when not looking at the cube. I tried  making a public Gameobject named outline and then using Destroy(outline); but that throws some errors and looks like it's trying to destroy the asset itself and not the in-game object.

Any help is appreciated.

Problem code:

       Ray ray = camera.ViewportPointToRay(new Vector3(0.5F
            RaycastHit hit;
            if (Physics.Raycast(ray
               if (hit.transform.tag == ""Cube""){
	    			
	    			
	    			if (hit.collider.gameObject != current){
	    				if (current != placeHold) {Destroy(outline);}//&lt;-- This bit was the problem
	    				current = hit.collider.gameObject;
					Instantiate(outline
				}

Fixed code:

		Ray ray = camera.ViewportPointToRay(new Vector3(0.5F
        RaycastHit hit;
        if (Physics.Raycast(ray
           if (hit.transform.tag == ""Cube""){
				
				
				if (hit.collider.gameObject != current){
					if (current != placeHold) {current.transform.FindChild(""boxOutlineA"").renderer.enabled=false;}

* Everything is currently CPU-bound which keeps it Indie-friendly

I had the following outline so far
    
1. How to organize your assets folder? I can keep the Scripts folder well organized, Sounds, etc... I'm a bit confused at the best way to organize each. I would like to know if there is some sort of ""Standard"" for this, so they may look at it, and possibly use it. Keeping to a standard makes it easier for other unity devs to come in and quickly understand what's happening.    
    
2. Javascript, I strive to keep my code clean, readable, and commented. Unity is very much along these lines, but there is 'some' uncertantity, and again, I would like to know the standard way.    
What should the public variables be named? The private? My variables are always hungarian ""mVarName"" but this gets screwy with the Unity Editor
Function Names? I always do ""FunctionNameHere()""
    
3. Breaking up your components. In my latest project, PlayerController and SideScrolling script, Aggro script (ammount til he goes into super mode), etc.    
I found this a lot more organized that one script to rule them all, have sub-objects within the script that you define. Is there a good guide on this, on how to break up your scripts properly for your object?",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/15dzs2/unity_organization_standards/

**TL;DR:** Awesomium lets you use HTML to build your in-game GUI. Folks at Awesomium had a working Unity Wrapper


**For those of you that can read**:

As some of you might known

This is all because it's pretty awesome to be able to build your in-game (or more general: in-app) interfaces using HTML, for example).

Now, thank goodness), so that people using Unity could also use the awesomeness that is Awesomium.

However, this was unfixable. 

People asked for fixes


The wrapper that I've been working on today borrows a lot from the official Awesomium wrapper for Unity (the one that's broken) in terms of design, Direct3D 11 and OpenGL). Especially this last part is nice because there's a bunch of wrappers out there that function somewhat the same (Such as the Unity Berkelium wrapper -- Unchanged for three years btw), except they use Unity's Texture.SetPixels() method (which is slower).

Currently it lets me browse the internet by attaching 1 script to an object that has a renderer and a collider attached (see screens). 

The point of this post is to gauge interest in this wrapper to see if enough people would want to be able to use Awesomium in Unity again

The challenge I'm up against is the trite desire to have a walkable ship interior and a physically simulated exterior for various space activities. I've skipped the idea of using RenderToTexture window panels for performance reasons (there'd be lots) and for the simple fact that I'm not using Pro (yet?). The workaround I'm looking at learning how to implement is to either hide the ship interiors in a single scene with the space environment

What I *think* I can do when it comes to looking out into space is use two cameras for the player; one standard camera tied to the player's model and a second camera parented to the ship's rigidbody and translated around a (likely scaled) local position relative to the player's position in the ship interior. If I'm understanding how that should work, and cull everything else from the interior camera.

What I'm asking is: will I run into obvious feature scalability problems with either the multi-scene or culling solution? My suspicion is that multi-scene could cause horrific problems when trying to adapt to multiplayer (a long-term optional feature),,False,self,t5_2qwj8,False,,True

I'm looking for a bit of help with collision detection. I'm prototyping a 2D top down roguelike. At the moment I have a Player cube that can move up, one square at a time. Every time they move there is a chance to spawn an enemy from an enemyPrefab. If the enemy is within a certain distance of the player, the enemy will move towards the player one square at a time every time the player moves (every turn). This all works reasonably well but all movement is done with transform.translate.  
  
At present the enemies will move towards the player and then come to occupy the same square as the player. What I would like them to do is stop in the adjacent square instead and then spend subsequent turns attacking the player
  
I'm assuming to do the things I want, is that correct?  
  
Does anyone have any advice for how I could proceed?  
  
Someone on Unity Answers suggested this:  
  
    float xDist = Mathf.Abs(transform.position.x - player.transform.position.x);
    float yDist = Mathf.Abs(transform.position.y - player.transform.position.y);
    if(xDist &gt; gridDistance || yDist &gt; gridDistance)
    {
        //move toward player
    }  
  
This works fine for the enemy

Edit:  
  
I ended up using raycasting and setting it uplike this...  
  
    void SearchSquare(Vector3 direction){
    
    RaycastHit target;
    if (Physics.Raycast(transform.position, 1))
    {
        string targetName = target.collider.gameObject.name;
        GameObject enemy = target.collider.gameObject;
        //Debug.Log (""You hit a "" + targetName);
        hitATarget = true;
       //return targetName;
      Attack(enemy);
    }
    }  
  
So now when the player tries to move it first calls the SeachSquare function

I'm completely new to Unity.  I'm making a primitive Asteroids game.  When the ship goes off the left of the screen

Fortunately the screen size will remain fixed.

I'm not looking for code to copy.  Just suggestions for techniques.

One idea that I had is that when the ship goes *near* the border, a clone is made screen-width off to the right, so that when the original ship does begin leaving the screen, the clone will enter it appropriately.  

Then once the original ship is completely outside of the screen

Does this seem like a good way to do it?

How would I go about cloning the ship and putting it in the right place?  The script for the ship is 'attached' to the ship itself.  Where else/how else might a script be running?  Again

Can a game object be deleted in-game?

        controller = GetComponent&lt;CharacterController&gt;();


        grounded = ((controller.Move(moveDirection * Time.deltaTime)) &amp; CollisionFlags.Below) != 0;

Of course there's more to the script

They're pretty straightforward - I just made my first one. An attribute you can add to a string field to turn it into a dropdown listing all subclasses of some type. The name of the selected type is then stored in the string property.

So I thought this was the kind of thing that's easy to share between projects. I had a look around but couldn't see anyone doing so

What you're seeing are two cubes through my orthographic camera.  I'm trying to fake a drop shadow.  The shadow is just parented onto the blue one.  

So

Is there any explanation or solution for this?

**Edit: My Findings so far:**

First

I have no clue if this is really practical

* **To find the amount of pixels in 1 unit:**
 * 0.5 * screen height / ortho size = pixels in 1 unit
* **To find amount of units taken up by 1 pixel:**
 * ortho size / 0.5 * screen height = units in 1 pixel

Therefore

* **To scale game object to desired pixel amount (hopefully power of 2
 * ortho size / (0.5 * screen height) * desired pixels = scale needed to achieve desired pixels on screen

And one more

* **(having a little trouble here
 * object scale * (0.5 * screen height) / desired pixels = ortho size

Don't laugh at my mathing, I have been testing this and it seems to work so far!

To install this template you need download [UnityClass.zip](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/195136886/Unity%20Templates/UnityClass.zip) and copy the zip file in to your ItemTemplates folder for Visual Studio.  Leave the template in the zip file
&gt;  C:\Users\MYUSERNAME\Documents\Visual Studio 2010\Templates\ItemTemplates

Once the file is copied you should be able to go in to Visual Studio, and you will now see ""Unity Class"".

1374280220.0,1io1ud,How to create a super fast update loop without using FixedUpdate,Quixotic7,9,2,19,"So I'm working on a project in which I need an update loop that runs about 200 times per second. We can achieve this by changing the timescale for the FixedUpdate

**Edit:** Thanks for the replies, but unfortunately your brain is a lot more sensitive to framerate with touch than your eyes are. At 60fps, you can feel stepping. The stepping starts to smooth out around 120fps and something around 200fps feels great, and gives a really solid smooth sensation. 

I only really need about two loops that run at 200fps. In the speedy loop we will do all our math to calculate forces and stuff from our game objects. We then filter these values using an exponential moving average filter, but there is really no need to calculate physics objects that fast. As more Physics interactions start occuring, it will eventually cause the fixedUpdate to run slower than the desired framerate. This is quite problematic as then the values sent to the controller will slow down and you will feel the difference. 

The solution is probably to create a new thread. I've never tried doing such a thing in Unity and have no idea where to start and what kind of problems I may run in to. 

**Edit 2:** I've concluded that pretty much the only way I will be able to do this will be to create a separate thread

**Solved** Starting a separate Thread was the solution. This of course can cause some issues with keeping stuff in sync but since I'm not needing to use Unity's API in the thread, thanks for the comments and ideas!

**Edit 3: For anyone else wondering how to do this**
I've been reading a bunch about how to work with Threads in Unity

Here is a simple script I wrote to test the execution of a separate Update Thread

    using System.Threading;
    using System;

        // This is used for keeping track of time

        // However
        private object _threadLock = new object();

	    private void Start () {
            // Start the thread that will be the SuperFastLoop
            _updateThread = new Thread(SuperFastLoop);

                _updateCount = 0;
                _time = Time.time;

	        _updateCount++;

            var time = System.DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks;
            const int oneSecond = 10000000;
            var count = 0;

            // This begins our Update loop
            while (true)
            {
                if (System.DateTime.UtcNow.Ticks - time &gt;= oneSecond)
                {

Hopefully we can get a discussion going here on some various techniques that will work in Unity.

First

The easiest and most straightforward method imaginable is to simply use the meshes that are generated for the graphics as MeshColliders. This will work perfectly if your world is static (i.e you cannot add or remove voxels at run-time)

Another approach is to use BoxColliders for individual voxels, destroying them if the voxel they´re associated with is removed or suddenly hidden behind others. I've tested this and it works quite well with small worlds, but creating and destroying GameObjects is slow and the bigger your world, the longer the delay (or game freeze) when editing voxels. I'm not sure why it is like this, but with the amount of GameObjects you get with this method it's not surprising.

It might be possible to optimize this method by not destroying a collider when the voxel is removed

Yet another method I thought of, and instead just shift them around as the objects move. This approach might work, but I'm worried it will cause problems with fast moving objects.

The ideal solution, extending the standard Collider class. It could access the voxel data directly and play nice with Unity's physics system without having to create a whole bunch of other stuff. Sadly, I've learned you cannot extend Unity's built in classes, or at least not the colliders.

So

Here is the game I'm working on: http://tonycoculuzzi.com/gamefiles/doomed/

In the web-player (at least for me) you have to be very close to the doors or interactive objects to activate them. And then when they move, but when you look directly at the door (when opened, look at the edge of the open door model) it doesn't trigger a hit, but when you look more toward the wall, it does.

This isn't supposed to happen

 I've got quite a few questions that pertain to how things work, I'll probably go off onto some radical tangents). Any answers or information pointing me towards finding the answers myself would be greatly appreciated. In fact, thanks for even reading this far.

On to the questions. Hold on Chewie...

**A**) Identifying individual devices - I'd like to take some unique device ID and use it or a derivation of it as the key in a mySQL table for each player but I haven't been able to find a best practice for identifying an individual player's phone (or tablet I guess, right? How is this done usually?

**edit:** Since I've started this list I've found SystemInfo.deviceUniqueIdentifier . Is that a good solution?

**B**) Getting GPS coordinates - I'd like to get and use the player's GPS coordinates in game mechanics. Everything I can find points me towards using iPhoneSettings.StartLocationServiceUpdates() even if I'm building for Android, is there anything I can do anything in particular to minimize the games' effect on the battery due to the GPS use? I wouldn't need to pull GPS coords more than every 5-10 minutes for gameplay to work the way I want it to.

**edit:** Again

**C**) Minimum API level - In the Player Settings

**D**) Audio files - Are audio files handled the same on Android? Do I need to do anything to source files as far as compression before I bring them in as assets?

**E**) Images/textures -  What is the ""really don't go bigger than this"" size as far as images and textures? If I really wanted  to splurge on the texture size for say a skybox

**F**) MySQL - I want to store and retrieve player and environment data in a MySQL server. First

**G**) Statistics - What numbers should I be shooting for to get a pretty wide range of playability across hardware? I was told when developing Unity for PC/Mac, the rest should follow nicely. First, is that total bullshit? Second, whats important on Android?

**H**) Other security concerns - I would imagine the largest concern would be an open vector into the SQL db

**I**) Screen Orientation - I want to switch between landscape and portrait in different stages of the game

**J**)  Application.genuine - Does it work reliably?

**K**) Purchased Scripts/Systems - I have a couple of purchased scripts from the asset store that I'd like to use in my Android project. Is there a way to verify scripts will work on Androids interpretation of the script vs desktop interpretation? Did that last sentence even make any sense?

**L**) Load Times - What do people usually put up with as far as load times? What's your personal goal to shoot for as far as the longest a player has to sit looking at the same screen? What are the major offenders as far as load times?

**M**) What do you wish you knew when you started on Unity for Android?

If you've gotten this far, advice or answers you can provide would be appreciated, even if it's just a search term to describe what I'm looking for. ",,False,self,t5_2qwj8,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Unity3D/comments/z1dl6/an_array_of_questions_primarily_about_unity_on/

1338697328.0,ui6kl,What do security-conscious people do for multiplayer networking?,jorgenpt,9,0,4,"Hi

I've been tinkering with Unity's networking support today

They have [Network.InitializeSecurity](http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/ScriptReference/Network.InitializeSecurity) which takes care of network layer security (but it doesn't seem to authenticate the server)

Here are my gripes with using Unity's networking to do ""game layer"" security:

 * It doesn't seem to be possible to restrict who's allowed to call Network.Instantiate/Network.Destroy. For security
 * RPCs always arrive with NetworkMessageInfo#sender set to -1 (if you used RPCMode.All and this is the sending machine) or 0 (every other case, and the clients can't tell it's not from the server. The only solution to this involves not being able to use RPCMode.All in your code, and instead use RPCMode.Server to fake broadcast: You'd have the server relay the information with a unique magic number for each client, so that the client can ascertain that it came from the server. This also means you need to re-implement buffering (since you can't use RPCMode.AllBuffered).

Are these concerns correct - or did I miss something in my tinkering? If they are

As alternatives

 * [Photon](http://www.exitgames.com/Photon/Unity) - has semi-authoritative support
 * [uLink](http://muchdifferent.com/?page=game-unitypark) - seems to have good security and integrates well with Unity

I'm working on a 3D game and I want to have a ""you can go anywhere"" approach separated by rooms. The world will be fairly large

Here's how the system is supposed to work:

* You're in a room with a door. When you do something to open the door

* If you go into the next room

* If you open a new door in the next room

* When a room unloads, unless they are marked by a global flag (for example if a bridge is broken, the bridge will stay broken even if you go back).

What we need and what we're doing/looking for:
We're planning on creating a 2d multiplayer rpg with some maps hand created, raster based pixel art, or possibly vector due to scaling. We plan on making this very basic at first because it's a learning experience for us (two ppl working on this). I've programmed server side before (although not for a game), so this project is sort of an amalgamation of all my previous experience and learning more about game development as well. Regardless, we want to begin with a very basic 2d map with client(s) &lt;-&gt; server interaction.

My question is, something that can support larger maps without consuming a lot of resources. With that said, obviously it would be bad coding if the entire large map was generated for a client but only the user viewable area was seen (i.e. 5km x 5km map with .25km x .25km viewable), thus I'm not sure if there is a map making engine that only renders the user viewable area when compiled. Are there plugins that can be modified if the featureset isnt exactly what we want, so we can customize it to our own requirements? And is there anything that comes close to providing some of these capabilities?

Update, some issues... i would suspect that the process of exporting the scaling itself is going to be the real issue here since every package handles the exporting process in it's own way.

As it stands, however, only one other thing... mecanim will read them as long as you don't change anything in them. when it does, it just drops that info. so, Legacy is the direction i'm headed.

Update, this is for max and you agree to use this information at your own risk because messing about and making some errors in the expression/wiring phase could cause some seriously bad stuff to happen.

It looks like pretty much the only plugin for this is RageTools Pro.

Has anyone here used this plugin much? It seems good from the videos

I'm thinking that our workflow will be:

   * generate puzzle icon in external program
   * Import SVG into Rage Tools
   * animate the object

An example icon and animation would be a flower with an idle animation of it swaying in the wind

None of the animations would be physics based. I'm not trying to setup a skeleton for some kind of IK rig either. Just simple timeline animations. If it's easier to do the IK rig though

What happens if we have to change the SVG? Does the existing animation work basically get trashed and you have to redo it all?

Is creating animations with this really frustrating? I know when I try to use the Editor to edit Ragesplines or do any kind of non-code animation I want to shoot myself. I end up doing everything in code.

This works great when the object is large and spherical. But when you're trying to pick up something skinny (eg an axe) it's annoying as hell to line up your crosshairs over the axe handle.

What I want is to shoot a 'thick' ray with a radius the size of the crosshairs and highlight anything that intersects with it.

So far the only thing I've tried is putting a larger trigger collider on the object in addition to a solid collider and setting raycasts to hit triggers. This worked OK if an object was isolated but it got confusing when trying to pick up objects with overlapping triggers.

*  Solidify - Removes white halos from transparent textures. Solidify fixes the fully transparent pixels of your textures so they can be displayed properly when they are sampled by the engine.  
*  Resize - Lanczos (great for reduction)
*  HSL - Hue

I have been laying down the basic mechanics for an RPG.  
The player can press the tab key to cycle through nearby enemies and left click to attack
Everything related to this works fine
The only problem I am having which I haven't been able to solve is that when I target one enemy
The enemy's health is displayed on a plane which floats above the enemy and faces toward the camera.  The texture of the health bar is changed at different health levels to indicate this.  I am suspicious that using this method to display health may be the cause of the problem but I thought I might ask for help here first before I bother recoding it to work in a completely different way.

Here is the script which controls how the player attacks and targets enemies:

}

{  
    // Find all game objects with tag Enemy

    gos = GameObject.FindGameObjectsWithTag(""Enemy"");

    for (var go : GameObject in gos)  {   
        var diff = (go.transform.position - position);  
        var curDistance = diff.sqrMagnitude;   
        if (curDistance &lt; distance) {   
            closest = go;   
            distance = curDistance;

So, I made my own, and here's how I did it: I made a simple movement script, attached it to a box, and then parented it to the main camera. Simple, right? Just in case it's necessary, here's the script I wrote:

    public var speed = 5;
    function Update () {
        var newPosition : Vector3 = transform.position;
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.W)){
        newPosition.z += speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.S)){
        newPosition.z -= speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.A)){
        newPosition.x -= speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        if (Input.GetKey (KeyCode.D)){
        newPosition.x += speed * Time.deltaTime;
        }
        transform.position = newPosition;
    }

I then made boxes and a wall. Their positions and rotations are locked on all axis

So, it gained permanent momentum in the opposite direction that it encountered the rigidbody at. When it came to a wall, the character was flung through it and gained tons of permanent momentum.

I'm not sure where to go from here. I did a bit of research

I use an orthographic camera in my game. Lately I changed the way I make houses to use texture atlas.

The problem is that since then I got some strange artifacts when the camera is at a certain position.

Like this: http://i.imgur.com/Od2yH53.png

I got those before (like the one on the door which doesn't use an atlas) but it got really visible with the atlas.

I know it has someting to do with the camera orthographicSize but I can't get it right no matter what I do. And it has to work on all resolutions.

-----------

Here's how the camera is configured

var s_baseOrthographicSize = Screen.height / 64.0f / 2.0f;

Camera.main.orthographicSize = (s_baseOrthographicSize * 10);

---------------

How can I avoid these ? It seems to be more rare on the scene window by the way.

  How hard is it to get things to work with the mecanim system if I create everything (model/rig/animations)?  I've watched the tutorials and they make it seem pretty easy to use but I'm skeptical of how easy it will be once I'm using it and get my assets imported.

 My understanding is that there's some base animations that can be applied to any rigged model as long as they have the same # of joints.  Do I just go create some animations for a particular character and then as long as my other characters have the same # of joints and joint hierarchy

Also, put them on a rig, and then put them through mecanim to animate?  I'm also worried about it being buggy and from a lot of other posts by other people, it looks like things get messy with the joints when it's not exactly set up like the default unity model.
