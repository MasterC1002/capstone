You know those guys who sell tapes and books along the lines of “I’ve made my self rich now let me sell you my book telling you how”

This sub is full of those guys. They want to 

A.

Dive traffic to their sites to “show you how” or 

B. 

Want you to sign up to work under them so they can make cash off of your time. 


You CAN make money here just be aware and think about it. 


90% of the people on this sub are the ones looking to make cash OFF of you

The flood of down votes I get should be something in its self to think about. 






Edit:

Wow guys way to prove me wrong about the down votes. Gives me a bit more hope in the direction the sub is going. 

Just to clarify my stance after reading some responses…
Ref links aren’t the problem. I don’t like pyramid shaped earning models what ever form they come in but that’s not my rant. I only hope people understand that earnings on most these sites aren’t always what people make it out to be and to stop and think “is this guy getting something out of this?” before you buy what they are selling.

1370315552.0,1fmmo2,How I earn $400~ a week,BeerMoneyThrowaway1,525,105,178,"I wasn't sure if this is the appropriate place to post this as it requires a little more involvement than these other 'beer money' methods but I figured it cant hurt to try.

Last year while I was finishing a full-time 2 year Tafe course, to see if I can make a little bit of money online to help out, I tried a bunch of methods like writing online articles, a few of those sites where they pay you to click ads and all that stuff, but I wasn't even nearly happy with the results.

As an android phone user I constantly saw extremely simple apps on the store that had thousands of paid downloads so naturally I thought ""how hard can it be to make an app like that?"", watched some instructional youtube videos on android app development and within a week or so had constructed my first app. It cost $25 to buy an android developer account capable of submitting apps to the store. I figured I'd make that money back anyway, so I bought the account and posted the app.

I posted it for $1.30 and made roughly 1-3 sales per day. Still nothing amazing. Fast forward a month or two and I had about 5~ simple little android apps up on the store which were netting me about $5-10 per day.

I thought I'd expand my operation so I got VMWare

Combined I'm currently making $15~ a day with both android and iPhone paid apps as I've stopped making paid apps on them platforms.

About 3 months ago I thought I'd try making the apps free with ad support rather than charging $1 for them.

The results were fantastically better, but didn't charge for them.

I'm making roughly $35 per day just from free apps

Obligatory [proof](http://imgur.com/a/OXYjj). I only just took these screenshots before writing this post.

These companies have very strict policies about sharing earnings

Sorry if this is the wrong subreddit to post this.

AMAA I guess.

Edit: I forgot to mention the best part about all this!
It's all automated. I could forget about this whole operation and I'd still get those 4 payments each month straight into my bank account for years to come! :D

called SkimaTalk, but I have done this, they pay at the beginning of the following month (first week of December for November work, i.e.), through PayPal.

What: you videochat with people who want to learn English. You decide on a ""lesson plan"" together or you just have a conversation.

Who: students (people paying you) are mostly Japanese professionals, i.e. you) are people who speak fluent native English and are in or have graduated from a college.

Get started?: To start you sign up on [the SkimaTalk website](http://www.skimatalk.com/become_teacher?locale=en). You get interviewed by one of the other teachers or people in charge

When?: you set your availability, but have had sessions at all times of day. You get a notification if someone books a session. You can also just go on the site and say ""available now"" if you have some free time that you didn't schedule, and someone might book you.



Any other q's? Not sure how to assure you this is legit... according to Koji, but it's great for when you have some free time. Good for beer money!


Sorry if I did this post wrong or anything! Is there a place I can put my name for referrals? If you put my name down &amp; become a teacher I get $20! Pay it forward! Any q's?

1340134041.0,vafy8,My system and average monthly income. ,Failedjedi,297,50,88,"Just thought I would give a rather lengthy post detailing what sites I use to make some extra spending money as online income and what my average monthly income is from them. I think it would be a good idea for others to share their systems as well to help give others tips. 

[Ibotta](http://ibotta.com/r/ptBaQ) is a service that pays you to shop. When you open the app you see all the options of items. When you hit the item they have various tasks, view the facebook page, etc. When you complete the tasks (you can do the tasks at home ahead of time) you will get xx amount for buying the item. You simply buy the item, scan the barcode, upload a pic of the receipt and they deposit the amount in your account within 24 hours on weekdays. You have to have at least $5 to cash out and it is via PayPal. 

[Crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com) is a little bit of a game. Every day there is a question, and they have great support, and payout quick if you win. Great service, highly suggest this site. 

[ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4870918) is a site that pays you for watching ads. You also can click randomly on the clixgrid to try to win random amounts. You can also complete offers and take surveys. They are one of the oldest PTC sties and are very reliable. They also have a premium account

Bamboo Wallet is an iOS and android app (called junowallet on android) that has you do various things to earn rewards. It has surveys, it is very similar to some of the various websites, but is an app. If you want to use my referral just enter TH1272839 after creating your account when it asks you for your invite code. Entering an invite code also earns you $0.25 at sign up. 

[GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/invite/TH98425) is sort of like swagbucks and superpoints combined. Same deal as most sites, complete offers and get points. But like superpoints there is a treasure chest that rewards random points. The more active you are the more keys (tries) you have to get more random points. 
 
[Tapporo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapporo&amp;hl=en) is an android app very similar to bamboo wallet/junowallet made by the people who do gift hulk. It is not a gift hulk app, watch videos, complete offers and get points. Redeem points for rewards. They offer gift cards including amazon, as well as paypal. My referral code is TAPTH1423 and you will get a little bonus when you use it. 

[Quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=04552d4bd936c36aaf2c263874361bce) is a site where you get involved in different parts of a products development. You vote on ideas you want to see make it further, you get a portion of the sale. At first the income is slow, but if you are active for a while you can get some decent profits. 

[FreeMyApps](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/267a79c6) is an iOS app that has you try out apps for credits, so you can cash out often. The ratio of credits to dollars is the same as the higher values, so no reason to save up and wait.

[FeaturePoints](https://featurepoints.com/r/P31E9Q) is just like free my apps. Download apps

[Viggle](http://join.viggle.com/thudia) is an iphone/android app that you watch ads and check into TV shows. Ads very in value and different shows have different bonuses. One of my higher payout sites, and check into the most valuable prime time shows. Average monthly income = $30-$50 in value for various gift cards/rewards

[Mturk](http://mturk.com) well knows service, sometimes I don't. Sometimes I skip a few days then get a $15 day, just depends. 

[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/?cmd=sb-trk&amp;t0=blgTrk&amp;t1=5136201&amp;t2=69) is another common one I am sure you most use. But get points, and daily no strings offers. I then get one daily search worth points, usually within a few searches every morning. I have a few referrals that are not really getting me much, but I get a little boost from that. I don't do surveys or anything else, just the 5 minutes it takes to do what I said. I also try to get swag codes when I can, but not often. My average monthly gain = $20 -$35 in amazon gift cards and paypal. 

[Bing Rewards](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=CAE0F591-2696-4D99-8BB3-C09C606F7011) This one is slower but easy. Just search bing and get points. Everyones points seem to be different and random as to what the daily cap is. But I spend 3 minutes every morning doing my daily max. Just search and keep hitting related. Average monthly gain = $5 amazon gift card. 

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=6661696C65646A656469) pays for clicking ads. My strategy was right away rent 25 referrals, but I have renewed a good set of 25, and expect to come out ahead $6 this month and $12 next month. It depends if my referrals keep up and I don't have to recycle any more, and I plan on reinvesting for more, so slower start to making money, but can be good once you get going and start reinvesting earnings. 

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=CS6VL7ZJ9H45) is slow paying but 100% passive. You just sign up, but it is completely passive. 

Lastly is apptrailers and m.appredeem.com these 2 share a points system and login
 Just playing with it when I have downtime I have made $15-$30/mo. 

So share what you do and how much you make. Worth noting is that neobux, topline, and swagbucks take me almost no time. I do them all in the morning everyday in under 30min. A few minutes each with topline being completely passive. I probably never spend more than an hour or two a day doing mturk either. So2 hours a day for $200+/mo cash and $50-$100 in gift cards every month isn't too shabby.

I don't want you to think I have other motives!). I'm creating it because there's many apps that aren't mentioned here often that are some of the best and fastest beermoney makers - period!

Note: All are USA only unless specified in the description (Or if they offer PayPal)


**FeaturePoints:** Go to featurepoints.com to get this web-app. Super popular, it has an excellent referral program). Download free apps to get credits, and you can redeem them for Amazon, PayPal (SCORE!), iTunes, paid applications, and even an iPad Mini. One of the best interfaces of all of the beermoney apps

**AppBounty:** Go to appbounty.com to get this web-app. Another version of ""download free apps, iTunes, and now Xbox live codes. What's great about them: **International!** They offer gift cards in the following countries, the USA, France, Spain, Italy, UK

**FreeAppParty:** Download this in the iTunes store. Just started using this 3 weeks ago, don't ask), and redeem for prizes. They put two apps up a day which is nice, and after downloading the app you do a scratch off where you can win 200-1000 points (.20 to a dollar). Prizes are $15 iTunes and $15 Amazon. I enjoy the frequency with which they put up new apps, so although the prizes are a little pricey, I can endorse this one. 

**App Trailers:** Ah, they pay PayPal (yes!). They usually add at least an app a day, and this is a solid way to make a couple dollars a month for only a couple minutes a day of work.

**AppJoy:** Download in the iTunes store. Another one you've probably already heard about. Download apps for credits which can be redeemed for Amazon/iTunes/Paid apps. Prizes are pretty pricey

**AppDog:** Find this at appdog.com. Here's one you've probably never heard about! Download apps and receive ""bones"" which can be redeemed for PayPal, you can easily get $10 in 30 minutes! I personally LOVE this app, I just found out about it but it is amazing. *Highly Recommended*

**AppCasher:** Find at appcasher.com, sometimes getting credited is tricky, but nonetheless it's another solid way to get some free gift cards.

**FreeMyApps:** One of my personal favorites, have debatably the best interface, and upload new apps every day. You can cash out for Amazon and iTunes, as well a number of other gift cards. I love this one!

**FreeAppSlots:** Find it at freeappslots.com, Amazon + iTunes, and even iOS devices! This one pays well if you can hit it big, otherwise it's a little slow compared to the others. Customer service is iffy here as well.




**As far as referral codes go, but the only reason I'm making this is to help my fellow brethren in the quest for some easy beermoney.**

On June 25th

I've decided that I want to help people with mturk. I would like to get more people involved. I see people post on here looking for ways to make fast money. When I see someone asking to make 5 bucks quick, made a couple of bucks, and then stopped. I went back to it like a year later, and this time I joined forums and followed hwtf and was able to get the hang of it very fast. I've been turking since. 

mturk.com 

For those of you that do not know what turking is
If you prefer text over videos

One thing that made me stop so fast the first time was because finding hits was so confusing. I've made a site to help specifically with that. On HitStream we post just hits. You can say we find the hits for you. 
www.mturkhitstream.com
this is also what [this](http://www.mturkhitstream.com/forum/viewforum.php?f=3) section of the forum does if you prefer forums

If any of you have any questions

and one last thing I must point out, some days are good, some days are ok, and some are terribly slow. One day you can make 20 bucks, the next you can make 50. And do not expect to have 50 buck days when first starting.

Really? You mean unlike other mods on other subreddits? This isn't a website that you need to host or maintain

If you want to make money off of this subreddit or other

I don't know

I think it's very disingenuous to ask for donations on a subreddit. Especially having it be the top thing in the sidebar? I mean come on...

---

Edit: So some of the mods have commented as well as a bunch of users in the community so I would like to make a quick edit.


Mod stoaster asks:
    
&gt;Is the donation information acceptable when put at the bottom where it isn't taking priority over the important things like Rules and Other Helpful Reddits?

I think more than the placement of the link (though I think it's far more acceptable at the bottom.) is the wording it in. Saying things like ""We moderate /r/beermoney without pay. To support us, they should be donating to Reddit, the people fronting all of the costs and making sure this subreddit and others actually work, not you guys (do you all even get to touch the Bitcoins? Where the heck does it go?) People are not only under the impression that you are somehow taking care of this subreddit as if it was a website but some people believe these donations make their way back to the community. If that's the case I personally think it should say that, but I don't think that is the case.

   
&gt;Does it need to be removed entirely? Why or why not?

I think so. If we have bitcointip here than you don't need the donation link. If someone wants to donate to on of you for something you are doing they can give you a tip

I also don't think this community should be about donations. You having that donation link on the side

**UPDATE 3**: Thank you all again for all of the overwhelming response to this post. I received another email from Pam at Schlesinger Associates today:

&gt;*We’re still recruiting so as soon as we’re done (which should be today)

From my interpretation

On a happier note, and I'm able to raise more funds for a cause that's near and dear to me. Also, I sincerely appreciate the generosity of those who said that they will donate a small portion of their study incentive to my fundraising efforts. The power of the Reddit community to do good never ceases to amaze me.

I will continue to provide market research opportunities as they become available to me :)

**UPDATE 2**: I just got another email from my contact at Schlesinger.

&gt; Hi Dave

&gt; We're working on the next wave starting today so if your guys qualify
**I think all but 4 of the good men you sent me yesterday pre-qualified**. I'll shoot you a note later and let you know who they were. 

This sounds like wonderful news -- I believe they are taking my recommendations to heart! I've also received word from a couple of you already that you've been formally accepted into the study. Awesome :)

IF YOU FILLED OUT THE SCREENER AND PRE-QUALIFIED PRIOR TO 9:00AM PST ON MONDAY (5/6/13)

That specific cut-off time is because Schlesinger sent me a file around 9:30am that was filtered on people who listed me as a referral source. *If you filled out the survey after the file was sent over to me

**UPDATE 1**: Holy cow! I just got an email from Pam Lintner

&gt; Dave!
You’re amazing.  I’m diving into the data now to see what all we got but it looks like you’re raising some money.   **I wish with all my might that I had reached out to you earlier as you delivered more people than we can use for the Google project.  That said

She just provided me with a list of **over 500 individuals who responded and listed me as a referral source!**  In light of this

**IF YOU FILLED OUT THE SCREENER AND PRE-QUALIFIED PRIOR TO 9:00AM PST TODAY (5/6/13)

If you filled out the pre-screener after 9:00am today

There are more potentially qualified applicants than available slots for the study

Hey Reddit friends! If you're a US male aged 18-40 and have an Android-based phone and a Gmail account

Schlesinger Associates, and how they go about meeting those information needs.

Now here's the even more awesome part: Schlesinger Associates has offered to make a donation to [my fundraising efforts with The Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society's Team In Training program](http://pages.teamintraining.org/sf/ambbr13/daveandrade) for each candidate I refer to this study! It's definitely a win-win all around.

This week-long study involves responding to quick one-minute questions sent to your phone 5 times a day for 5 days, I'm already enrolled in the study and am ready to start next week :)

I highly encourage you to fill out [this pre-screening questionnaire](https://www.research.net/s/helpdaveraisemoneyforhisride) -- they are looking to fill these remaining study slots as soon as possible. Be sure to select ""Dave A."" when asked if there was a specific person who referred you to this study :)

1340415607.0,vgqi2,Using Only Passive Income Tools For Free Income,F0restCrunk,141,21,69,"Hey Reddit! If your like me you don't have time to click links, clicking

[TopLine](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=LN2JV7N22MBC) ([Refferal](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=LN2JV7N22MBC)/[nonref](https://www.jointopline.com))
 is one of the easiest passive income tools available. You simply install the TopLine addon for the browser of your choice and instantly start earning points. Topline uses adspace on webpages and inputs its own ads as you browse webpages. In my experience


[i-Gagnant la barre](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=bunzdude&amp;lang=en) ([Refferal](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=bunzdude&amp;lang=en)/([nonref](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com)) is a simpler version of Topline that also allows you to acquire passive income. The program requires you to download an advertisement bar where advertisements are streamed continuously. The advertisement bar can be placed anywhere in your browser so on my larger computer monitors I don't even notice it. This can be used in conjunction with Topline. i_Gagnant la barre also utilizes the point system. The current conversion rate is 0.0935 euro/1000 points. I believe I earn about 100 points an hour. It is not the fastest way to earn money but every bit counts!

[Vagex](http://vagex.com/?ref=139431) ([Refferal](http://vagex.com/?ref=139431)/[nonref](http://vagex.com)) is another tool that I use to passively create income. It is a program that you use to view youtube videos and in return you receive points that can be turned into cash. Because this thread is primarily focused upon true PASSIVE incomes I would like to focus upon the View Count Vagex viewer. It is a program created by Vagex that auto-updates and auto-watches youtube videos. It also auto-likes, and auto-comments for additional points. After setting up the ViewCount program, mute the program using the sound mixer and just leave it running. It only requires CPU processing when loading the youtube video that may last anyway from 10 seconds to 400 seconds. Points are credited based upon how long the video is. 

[Bing Rewards](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=70C70210-44B0-4955-A1E9-91E1899739B9) ([Refferal](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=70C70210-44B0-4955-A1E9-91E1899739B9)/[(nonref)](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards). I'm sure you've heard of Bing by now. Unlike Google it has a great rewards system that can be used to earn Microsoft points

[Cash Texts](http://cashtexts.com/by/bunzdude) ([Refferal](http://cashtexts.com/by/bunzdude)/[(nonref)](http://www.cashtexts.com/) is the other program I use for passive income. This program begins after you submit a phone number that can receive text message advertisements that are valued at $0.05. After completing the form and a survey of your interests this program becomes completely passive. If you do not want to give out your mobile number

There are other passive income sources available such as BitCoin Mining, and other programs that use your computer's resources when it is idle for computing power. Personally, I prefer that I am the only one using my computers resources and many of the affiliate programs that use these methods have so-so reviews from participants. These programs can also require so much power from your computer that your electrical bill can increase larger than your earnings so I would not recommend these data mining methods to everyone. 

My final piece of advice for anyone attempting to make income online is to create a new e-mail address that you will only use for these income enhancing programs. That way you can stay on top of offers or alerts as they come and have complete control of your accounts. 

So what types of passive income do you use? I'd love to find more!

I have been selling books on Amazon for about 2 years now.  I usually get the books for super cheap (thousands of books for 50-100 bucks) and I spend probably an hour of my free time every week once the books are listed

*I had a lot of people ask me where to buy shipping envelopes

*Also people want to know where to get books.  I usually just post in my local classifieds that i am interested in picking up large quantity of books for free.  And i usually get a few calls a month from people who are just clearing out their library. And all i have to do is go pick it up.  Thats the best way.  The last person who called me wanted 100 bucks

You can use these links to make money on Pintrest or your own websites as well.

------

Tellwut: [Ref Link](http://www.tellwut.com/?refer=ZEROrevive) / [Non Ref](http://www.tellwut.com) - A very basic short poll site. Most of the polls on there take me between 2 seconds to just about a minute and a half. For each poll you get around 5-15 points. It costs 4

Neobux: [Ref Link](http://www.neobux.com/?r=ZEROrevive) / [Non Ref](http://www.neobux.com) - PTC site, which can be profitable. There are plenty of guides posted on beermoney for those who are interested.

Swagbucks: [Ref Link](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/ZEROrevive) / [Non Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com) - Make points for rewards such as Amazon Giftcards. This is one of the first sites I used. Currently I make points on here by putting in daily Swagbucks codes. I also started using Coupons on here

Pinecone Research: [Invite Link](http://pinecone.logicalmedia.com/?affid=CD25538) - No referral link for this one, rather swiftly. 

Paid Viewpoint: [Ref Link](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=wl4ih7
) / [Non Ref](http://paidviewpoint.com) - Another great survey site. You never get disqualified

Listia: [Ref Link](https://www.listia.com/signup/1551812) / [Non Ref](https://www.listia.com) - Not exactly a full pledged Beermoney site

Topline: [Ref Link](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=TTY6TDZ4C5YC) / [Non Ref](https://www.jointopline.com) - If you use adblock, you gain points. Points can be exchanged for Money in Paypal or a mailed in Check. Minimum Cashout is $10.

Bing: [Ref Link](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=_8093baa5-d7ee-9f30-27c5-cd1b5d9dd9e4) / [Non Ref](http://www.bing.com/) - Another good Semi Passive income. You search using Bings search engine and get 1 point for every 2 searches. Once you reach gold

Mturk: [Non Ref](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome) Most people know about this site. This is my biggest income site in general. I only do hits posted on [HitsWorthTurkingFor](http://www.reddit.com/r/hitsworthturkingfor) to save me general time and effort. Payments go into your Amazon Payments account

Do you love music?  Do you love money? Then check out Slicethepie!

Slicethepie is a website where up-and-coming artists submit music and pay for people to listen and give a review of it.  You only have to listen to 90 seconds of each song and you can type the review while listening.  Payment for each song depends on the length and quality of the review you type.  Typically

Now

60 minutes*60seconds = 3600 seconds

3600 seconds/90 seconds per review = 40 reviews per hour

40 reviews*0.20 dollars = $7.20 per hour.

Feel free to message me and ask me any questions you may have!  Hopefully you all enjoy it as much as I do!

Edit: It may only be available in the US.  Some people are telling me that it is not allowed in their country

Edit: tl;dr I make over $300 extra dollars a month by spending just over an hour a day on this site.

Well I decided to create a new subreddit to solve this problem.  It will be for the discussion of sites and online income strategies that allow the user to make more near or above minimum wage.


These strategies will be a lot more involved but will also allow for higher earning potential.  

So if you want to check it out.  Its over here at:

1360019040.0,17w8u1,My daily routine - 30 minutes a day - a comprehensive tutorial,thekiwi99,135,29,37,"**Why do you spend so little time every day?**

As I am a student, I've tried to perfect the art of making the most amount of money online with the least amount of time and effort.  This obviously means that I am not fulfilling my potential, as I could be making a lot more money using something like Mturk, or another site where you can do tasks.  This does mean however, that my daily routine is easy for anybody to follow, and make a fairly good amount of money for very little work.

**What sites do you use?**

The first site I go to on my quest for daily beermoney is [Crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com).  Most people already know about it, and the people who answer in the minority are eliminated.  The last one standing gets whatever the prize is, many of which are high value.  They have things like $25 amazon gift cards, Pandora One subscriptions, and many others!  This usually takes me 1 minute.

Second on the list is [GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/thekiwi99).  This is a site that is very similar to swagbucks, you can use your treasure box keys, which are free chances at prizes like giftcards, and hulk coins, take the daily poll for 1 hulk coin, and do many other things, like watch videos, also for hulk coins.  I can usually get between 120 and 150 hulk coins a day,200 hulk coins a month

The third site I visit every day, but when you also take the surveys and play the clixgrid like I do, it has great potential.  It usually takes me about 5 minutes to do the clixgrid, and the required clicks.  Another great source of income on ClixSense is referrals.  I have invited friends and family to join, and I get money from all of their clicks as well.  There are 8 levels of ClixSense referrals, meaning if you refer somebody, and they refer somebody, up to 8 people deep!  If you know a lot of people who would use ClixSense

The fourth and final site that I use is c.  Another PTC site, feel free to see the tutorial I wrote for it [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/16h0ij/detailed_neobux_tutorial_earn_money_for_working_5/).  I usually only use neobux for about 5 minutes a day, but like ClixSense, if you can get lots of referrals and if you do mini jobs, it has great potential to be a big earner.

**How much can I make?**

This is a fairly easy question to answer, so thats a 0, but it's fun, and I hope to win soon!  I make about 50 dollars a month from [GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/thekiwi99), and if you're willing to spend more than 15 minutes a day on it, you could double, or even triple that amount.  I'm nowhere near earning my full potential on that site.  On [ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4894814&amp;reddit1), and their referrals, with [NeoBux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=7468656B6977693939), and maybe increase that to $75 a month.  In total

**Why should I use your referral link?**

Simply put, unless you want to hurt a fellow member of the beermoney community.  Regardless, if you don't want to help me out, here are the links again.  The ref-link is on the left, in case you change your mind, and the non-ref one is on the right.

MOBILE APPS
------------------

**Bamboo Wallet:** Failedjedi had posted about this app a few times on this forum but I have not personally tried it yet. The app is available on the iPhone/Android store and allows you to complete surveys


**AppReviewerPro** is a mobile app where you download free or paid apps and write a review on the app. Your reviews don’t have to be lengthy or detailed to earn credit. Each review credits $0.40-$0.50 with the paid apps crediting for $1.50. You can read my discussion on the app [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/zqnjx/appreviewerpro_discussion/)


**Cash Texts** is a passive earner where you submit your mobile phone (or Google Voice) number and receive text message ads. 


**FreeMyApps** is an app available for the iPhone where you try out apps for credits which can be cashed out for amazon or itunes giftcards. Please check out datsoup for a referral link. 


**Viggle** is another app available for iphone/android where you watch adds and check into popular TV shows for credits. There has been a lot of talk lately that the have decreased payouts and earnings but is still a viable option for those with some free time on their hands. Viggle no longer has a referral system


**Apptrailers** and m.appredeem.com: these apps are quick earners at first but quickly slow down. You will earn around $15 for watching trailers for apps and downloading the apps. Open the apps for around 30 seconds and you will receive a notification that you have been awarded points. These apps are notoriously glitch in awarding points so if you don’t get your points at first


PASSIVE EARNERS
---------------------

**Topline** is a completely passive earner. It works by replacing ads on websites with ads from their customers. It is a very slow earner but does not take any effort so is completely worth it. The more you browse, simply disable it on all sites except where you watch videos (youtube, etc.) and be on your way. Also, do not use an autorefresher to earn extra points, again you will be caught and banned. The people in charge of Topline have been very active in this forum and are very open to feedback, so if you have a problem, don’t hesitate to contact them.


**Vagex**  is a passive earner that allows you to download a youtube video player that will auto-watch


SURVEY SITES
---------------------

**[Pinecone Research](http://pinecone.logicalmedia.com/?affid=CD25538):** This site is invite only (invite thanks to ZEROrevive). Pay is $3 per survey with no disqualifications through the survey. Cashout is via check or paypal.


**Paid Viewpoint** is a survey site with only 10 question multiple-choice surveys. Each survey pays between $0.10 and $0.20. You will earn $1 for each referral that completes 6 surveys. 


**PollBuzzer** is a very simple poll service. You will be emailed a link to a one-question survey when available and paid $1 directly to your paypal account when you answer. There are not a lot of polls available but for such low effort you can’t ask for a much better service. 


**Tellwut** is a very simple poll site with very short polls. This will be a quick earner to start and then slow down quite a bit. Most of the polls take anywhere from 5 seconds to 2 minutes. You will receive 5-15 points per survey and a $10 Amazon giftcard costs 4


PTC SITES


**Neobux** is a PTC site where you click ads and get paid very small amounts of money. What makes this site unique is that you can use your earnings or invest money to rent referrals and you will be paid for these referrals clicks. Overall I have not been very happy with Neobux


**ClixSense** is another PTC website that is based on direct referrals and mini-tasks. There is also a mini-game available with a chance to win cash or points. 


GPT SITES
----------------------

**Gifthulk** is a site that allows you to earn points in a number of various ways. You can: 
*Search and win coins
*Complete the daily poll
*Complete surveys or offers from their offer walls or EZ coins
*Enter Fountain of Youth codes (posted to their twitter
*Open the treasure chest for a chance to win coins
*Refer friends and earn 20% of their earnings from offers/tasks/surveys/ez coins.

I usually complete the daily poll


**Swagbucks** is a very common site that pays you to watch videos/search/complete offers. I complete the daily poll, and watch out for daily codes. One of the easiest ways to earn on swagbucks is to watch the comedy videos on their mobile app available for android devices (the comedy videos are the shortest and will earn bucks the fastest). If you don’t have an android, go to http://bluestacks.com/, download and install and search for the swagbucks app. This will just continuously run videos except occasionally an ad will pop up that you need to exit out of. I max these out daily along with the other things mentioned above to earn around 75 “swagbucks” per day which I cash out for $25 in amazon giftcards. Two important notes for this site: 1. Do not use an autorefresher to watch swagbucks tv as is recommended elsewhere, I have been banned for this 3 times, every time I thought I was being smart and wouldn’t be caught. They will catch and ban you. 2. Sign up for text alerts for swag codes by texting follow swagcodespoiler to 40404 if you are in the US, 21212 if you are in Canada


**Superpoints** is a site very similar to swagbucks/gifthulk. You can watch videos, check out this [guide from stoaster](http://weblootcentral.blogspot.com/2012/02/superpoints-is-one-of-many-sites-that.html). 


**Naturebucks** or Nature GPT. These two sites are very similar and are both highly recommended by other redditors. You can complete offers and surveys for cash or points. The referral program is great


OTHER EARNERS
---------------------------

**Quirky** is a very innovative site where you vote on ideas for new products or suggest names/taglines/etc. for the product to earn “influence” on the product. If the idea is made and sells


**[Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)** is by far my best earner but also takes the most time to make a decent amount of money.  Requester’s pay for people to complete menial tasks such as surveys


**Bing Rewards** This one is slow but simple. Just sign up and search. Everyone’s daily points seem to max out at a different level


**SliceThePie** is a website that pays you for reviewing songs. Make sure you write good reviews for $0.20 per review. Cashout is $10.


Anyways, please feel free to let me know in the comments down below. Again, as I view this as a community effort, please use referrals from datsoup. If for some reason you do not want to help out your fellow redditors on this forum, here are all of the non-referral links you will need:

So - below I am going to cover some different things that can start bringing in cash TODAY. BIG cash.

AFFILIATE NETWORKS:

I'm sure you have all heard of clickbank before.

I've never used clickbank

That reason alone is why I have never bothered with CB.

If you want to

For people who DO NOT want to mess with CB

The following affiliate networks pay you INSTANT COMMISSION

**JVZoo**

**Ref:** http://www.jvzoo.com/register/3989

**Non-Ref:** http://www.jvzoo.com

NOTE - For JVZoo, or with delayed payments. 

You will most likely start out on delayed until the vendor gets to know you better.

ALSO - JVZoo lets you list your own products for free, integrate with your autoresponder.. all kinds of cool shit. 

DEFINITELY check them out.

-----------------------------------

**RAP Bank (Rapid Action Profits)**

**Non-Ref:** http://www.rapbank.com

ALL of the products listed on RAPBank pay you INSTANT commissions. There is NO delayed payments settings at all. 

For example

Sale 2 goes to your paypal.

Sale 3 to the product owner

If a product pays 75% commission, 3 and 4 go to you.

If a product pays 100% commission (there are a lot that do) then EVERY sale you make goes directly to you.

Vendors typically use 100% commissions to attract affiliates

What they don't earn on the front end

-----------------------------------------------

**DigiResults:**

**Non-Ref:** http://www.digiresults.com

This is another instant commission platform.

--------------------------------------------------

Now - For CPA (cost per action)

I'm sure you have all seen those offers like ""enter your email or zip code to test and keep a FREE iPhone 5!"" -- right?

Of course you have.

What you did NOT know

That is an example of a CPA offer

CPA is a HUGE earner once you get the hang of it.

SO:

Assuming you are all new to CPA

Just be honest with your application

**Peerfly:**

**Ref:** http://peerfly.com/?r=47660

**Non-Ref:** http://peerfly.com

------------------------------------

**Here is a short video I just made to explain a little more about Peerfly &amp; how it works:**

http://tinypic.com/r/m9x75y/5

Don't mind the commentary.. I can never figure out exactly what I want to say when I'm doing a video (just talking to myself) lol

------------------------------------

I am also with several other CPA networks

So I am not going to link those right now.

This short list should be MORE than enough to get you guys (and gals) earning some REAL cash on the web. I guarantee it.

ALSO -- Vertical is CPA terms for niche

Hope this helps some people out.

This post was a lot longer than I expected it to be though

If anyone has any questions about anything just post a comment &amp; I'll see if I can help.",,t5_2s5or,1375560614.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/1jmqwj/ok_so_to_help_some_people_get_started_giving_this/
1353024021.0,139p3j,YouTube pays my cell phone bill and more.  It's my favorite source of passive Beermoney.  Ask me stuff,ZEFninja,128,23,75,"A while back I saw an AMA of someone who was making more than $500 a month making silly youtube videos.  I fired up my old youtube account and started posting videos.  I am now at nearly 400

In the last year I have only made a few videos but the checks keep coming.  Most of my views come from youtube and google searches.  When I make a new video I usually post it on Reddit and do a bit of SEO but that's it.  I am about to do another push with everything I have learned recently and hope that it will be paying my rent within a few months.  There is initial work with each video.  But what I love is that even if I don't make a new video for months or years I still keep getting paid.  

I make mostly cooking videos and the occasional random stuff.  Originally I tried to pander to the internet with stuff like BACON and CATS.  But I found more success in a different way.  For example I once got on the internet and tried to find a video on how to braise meat.  I couldn't find anything because the keywords I was using ""braise steak""  ""how to braise meat"" weren't coming up with anything good.  I finally called my mom and used her recipe.  But I used those keyword on my youtube video and ended up getting [13

I have been even more surprised by videos that had a lot of competition but because I used unique keywords I get views too.  Sure my video for [laundry soap](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6ME0F5bNHU) isn't number 1 but it gets views every month because I use the word ""detergent"" instead of soap.  

Here is my channel.  Shameless self promotion etc.:
http://www.youtube.com/ianmeek

I will answer any questions I can.

edit:  off to a film festival.  i will answer anything that comes up when i get back.

edit 2: thanks guys!  Glad I posted here.  Maybe we next time we can focus on getting lot's of views because that's where the money is at.  I would be interested to hear other peoples experience.",,t5_2s5or,1353105066.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/139p3j/youtube_pays_my_cell_phone_bill_and_more_its_my/

1375117013.0,1jab91,My Weekly Routine to make $45. Only about 1 hour per day.,sam867,115,28,22,"So

For my nightly routine I use 1 GPT site

**CashCrate** [Reference] (http://www.cashcrate.com/4812602) l [Non] (http://www.cashcrate.com/)

My GPT site of choice is CashCrate.  I use this mainly for surveys.  I like it because it always finds surveys I am approved for.  I am on this site for around 1 hour each night.  It allows me to complete about 2-4 surveys in a 1 hour time window and I don't waste time searching around for things I am approved for.

**I make about $3-$5 a night on this site.**

They also have one of the best referral programs for GPT sites so if you can get some friends to sign up you can earn a bit more even.

In conjunction with this.  I use to PTC sites while I am working on surveys.  These PTC sites I keep open in a separate browser so that I can ""watch"" ads while I answer survey questions.  There are multiple ones out there

**NeoBux** [Reference] (http://www.neobux.com/?r=Timmah33) l [Non] (http://www.neobux.com/)

**CashnHits** [Reference] (http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php?ref=timmah) l [Non] (http://www.cashnhits.com/)

Neobux is the most well respected of these sites it seems and the easiest to use.  It doesn't matter if I am focused on that browser or not while I watch ads

CashnHits is also great because it has an auto browsing feature that lets me run it and forget it in the background which pays around $0.20 a day.

**Between these 2 sites I make about $0.50 a day.**  Not bad for clicking a few buttons.

I also let my computer resources be used by Digital Generations.  I know this might be considered a pyramid scheme, its basically risk free money.

**Digital Generations** [Reference] (http://coingeneration.com/auth/new/347571/) l [Non] (http://coingeneration.com/)

**$1 a day**

**Web Answers** [Reference] (http://www.webanswers.com/_mc3tyqpo/) l [Non] (http://www.webanswers.com/)

Finally I work on 1 writing site. This is by far the easiest of the writing sites.  It involves answering questions and earning income using adsense.  I make sure I write for highly viewed questions.  It takes a little while to get started.  My advice is:

Answer 5 questions a night

Answer questions that have high views/low amount of answers

Answer questions that are newer

The first month is very slow.  I think I made $5 in a month.  Now things are picking up as I get more answers.  **I currently make about $5 a week with this strategy.**

Finally I use 1 smart phone app.  

**I use the new program Locket.**  [Reference] (http://getlocket.com/r/?48660719) l [Non] (http://getlocket.com/)

Its not much but it is completely passive and just pays you to display ads when you unlock your phone.  **I make about $1-$2 a week using this app.**  

CashCrate              $21-$35 

CashnHits                $1-$2

NeoBux                   $1-$2

Digital Generations    $7

WebAnswers            $3-$8

Locket                    $1-$2

**Totals**             **$34-$56**

On average I make about $45 a week doing about an hour of work each night.  Again a few take about a month or 2 to get going properly

**Topline**

Topline is a **must.** What Topline does is it changes the ads you see while browsing to their own Ads. You get paid for using their add-on and having their ads instead of your normal ads. Topline is a slow way to earn money but rquires no effort whatsoever!

Swagbucks has a variety of ways to earn money.

* By searching daily (I usually win about 4 times each day. On average about 10 swagbucks but sometimes up to 50.)

* By using SwagBucks TV - You earn 3 Swagbucks for every 10 videos watched. If you want to earn sawgucks really fast you could use an auto-reloader [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/reloadevery/) and set it to reload every 55 seconds. Do not watch too many videos or your account might be banned.

* By Playing Games - while you are playing games on swagbucks.com swagbucks are randomly awarded to you.

* By completing the daily poll every day you can earn 1 Swagbuck

* By completing Daily surveys - You complete daily surveys for swagbucks

* By completing Special Offers - These range from competition entries to site registartions to surveys. These offers give you a lot of swagbucks.

* By completing daily tasks hosted by Crowdflower - These tasks have a fairly low payout but can be completed countless times.

While studying with friends during dead week I was amazed at how many of them hadn't signed up for it and the ones that did didn't know what all they got from it. I am sure most of you here that are eligible already are using this but if not here are some useful things you get if you do sign up.

1. Free two day shipping from amazon. I am sure you will make a couple orders in the next 6 months so this alone should be enough to make setting it up worth it.

2. Prime Instant Video. Like movies and tv? Well this will allow you to watch streaming versions of some of your favorite shows for free. You can watch videos for free from Dora the Explorer to The Hunger Games. 

3. Exclusive student deals. I believe these include extra trade in for your textbooks and cheaper prices to buy or rent them. I honestly barely buy my books so this isn't something I have personally used.

4. They sometime have chances to earn free money by doing different things. Right now the big one is chance to win $10

5. Want all of these deals after your 6 months are up? You can buy for 50% off for up to 4 years after your trial expires.

1350572939.0,11ox05,InfoArmy Review - Make $15/hr Researching Businesses,Cheeseman1208,111,24,133,"I stumbled across InfoArmy on beermoney a couple weeks ago

**General Info**

The premise of InfoArmy is pretty simple. They crowdsource information about businesses (mostly private companies) and resell the information to business professionals for a markup. They sell each report for $99 via an iPad app


**The Work**

Pretty much, and all you have to do is check that it is correct. One report takes me 45min - 1.5 hours to complete, from start to finish. My goal for this week is to complete one to two reports per day. If you want to become more involved, there are badges and senior positions that mean different things, but aren't quite profitable yet.


**The Money**

Each report will net you $20 cash, that comes out to $15 - $20 per hour! Not bad for monetizing your free time ;) They pay out every 15th and 30th of the month if they owe you money. There is no way to check how much they will pay you, but I keep an Excel spreadsheet to keep track of the reports I have completed.
Now, it is amazing beer money.

1352945466.0,137t1x,/r/BeerMoney FAQ,CaptainKrill,105,20,63,"**/r/BeerMoney FAQ**

Welcome to /r/BeerMoney

**-What are some good sites to start with?/What sites can I use to make ""x"" amount?**

&gt;[Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/): Probably the most widely suggested site here because the payout is based off of how much time you put into it and it can be withdrawn directly to a bank account.
Also check out /r/HitsWorthTurkingFor if you're starting with MTurk.

&gt;[SwagBucks](http://www.swagbucks.com): The most widely used PTC (Pay to Click) site on the sub, polls, videos) that you can do/watch, to earn ""SwagBucks"" which then can be redeemed in their store for prizes and gift cards. The most codt efficient item to redeem from these sites is usually a $5 amazon gift card.


&gt;[Jebbit](http://www.Jebbit.com): A fairly new site where you answer a few questions about a webpage

&gt;[TopLine](http://www.jointopline.com/): This is generally the beginner set it and forget it site. It's a chrome extension that replaces ads with their own sponsored ads and pays you $1 per 1

**-Can I start a referral train?**

&gt;Referral trains are fine to start in the comments section of a post, as long as the sole reason of the post isn't to get referrals.

**-What I do when tax time comes around?**

&gt;Any website where you have over $600 of earnings from, but this is a bit of a gray area. I would love for someone who knows more about taxes to elaborate on this.

**-How can I earn the most money?**

&gt;[Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com): Has probably the highest potential earning power

**-Can I use BlueStacks with beermoney apps such as SBTV or AppTrailers?**

&gt;Swagbucks will ban bluestacks users, but be wary of using things like auto-clickers, because they might get your account suspened, and in AppTrailers world, you might as well be banned.

**-How do I get more referrals?**

&gt;[Datsoup](http://datsoup.com/) - a referral randomizer

1356632471.0,15j1l0,A beginner's guide to earning money on Amazon (due to interest on my other post),FredWampy,100,15,41,"[Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/15gry4/what_are_some_items_aside_from_books_and_video/) is my other post I mentioned. Let's face it. /r/beermoney has been great for a few bucks here or there

* My first step was to [purchase some envelopes](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HG964S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ghg7584jr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000HG964S) from Amazon ([non-ref](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000HG964S) - see the bottom of this post for information on the Amazon Affiliate Program). I bought these cheapie

* While waiting for the envelopes to arrive, costs, notes. I don't keep an inventory in the spreadsheet, as I can just turn my head to the left to see my items.

* My wife and I went through old DVDs

* I created my Amazon seller account

* When my envelopes arrived, keep in mind that you're paying them for a *massive* market! Generally, if you can sell it for a few bucks, it's worth your time. You get a feel for this after a few sales.

* **This is probably the most important part** of the sales strategy. With few exceptions, use your best judgment. Some things might be worth holding onto if you can double your money. Generally, in my opinion, it’s a better option to move inventory than to hold onto your item for a couple more weeks to earn $3 more.)

* **Also very important** is to describe your item in the “condition” field. You want people to know what they’re going to get. Does your book have creases on some pages? A little bit of water damage? Mention it. It won’t stop people from buying. Multiple ratings I’ve gotten have written “item as described” in the review. This is important to the buyer.

* Now you’ll start getting orders. Package the orders as they come in. There have been 3 days where I’ve gotten 10+ orders. If you do 1 or 2 at a time

* Post office time. I haven’t used UPS or FedEx, CDs, and books.

* Go to your seller page

* A week after I've shipped an item

**Tips:**

* Once you acquire some money from selling the items you have lying around (and I didn’t count items I already had toward any costs)

Here’s a story from a couple weeks ago: I found someone selling 18 games and a console for $100. I searched all the games on Amazon and figured that if I offered $60 for 8 of his games, but he wouldn’t split. All or nothing. I took it, figuring I could get $100 of those items, as well. I spent $135 purchasing 19 video games and a console. Of the 16 games I listed on Amazon, 10 sold that night. I paid for the $135 I spent, as well as the cost of shipping them all. Two days later, I sold the remainder (including the 3 crappy games and the console on Craigslist) and I came out $200 ahead when all was said and done.

Moral of the story: make informed purchases

* Don’t spend more money purchasing items than you’ve made selling items. If you buy a bunch of duds

* Please be safe when meeting people from Craigslist. Most people are normal people like ~~me or~~ you, go during the daylight. Don't go inside. Don't knock on the door if something seems off. Just call off the deal. Making $20 here and there isn't worth your well-being.

* I haven’t used [these](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000DT8CZS/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=ghg7584jr-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000DT8CZS) yet

I went to a used game store today and found 4 games that were cheaper in the store than on Amazon. I listed them an hour or so ago. While typing this post

**Amazon's Affiliate Program**

There are two distinct ways I achieve this monthly income
___________________________________________________________________________
**Active Methods**

   *Swagbucks*  - [Sign up](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/jtpavlock)

   &gt;In this guide, spend them on a $5 Amazon gift card. This will cost you 450 points each, but is the most efficient use of your points. 

   * Daily Poll - Everyday
   * NOSO - No Obligation Special Offers
   * Swag Codes - Every now and then
   * Searches - Just use the search functionality 3-5 times with legit searches (not random letters) and you will be rewarded with usually around **5-15 points**. This amount doubles on Fridays as well.
 
  **Total**: ~10-20 Swag Bucks **Time**: ~5 minutes


*Amazon Mechanical Turk (mTurk)* - [Sign up](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome?match=true)
 &gt; mTurk accounts for the majority of my income. However, they will need to validate your account, this will usually take between two days and a week. However, once you are validated, you can begin doing HITs and earning cash. 

* Finding HITs - Head over to /r/hitsworthtukingfor to find good HITs that are worth your time. Also, and is one which you are qualified for. I have that exact search template bookmarked so that I can quickly open it up and search for a HIT. A general rule of thumb I follow is that if the payout isn't at least $0.10/minute, the HIT isn't worth it. 

* Turkopticon - Make sure to download the extension [Turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) to weed out shady employers. The extension works for both Firefox and Chrome

   **Total**: ~$5  **Time**: ~50-60 minutes

----------------------------------------------------
**Passive Methods**

*Swagbucks* - [Sign up](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/jtpavlock)
 &gt; Now I am going to go over the passive side of Swagbucks. This side is focused around Swagbucks TV

* Swagbucks TV (web) - Before, new updates prevent this, as you will only be credited for viewing a specific video once a day. The way I've gotten around this is by using an auto clicker. I use one called [Auto Mouse Click](http://www.murgee.com/auto-mouse-click/) On the site there is a tutorial and a download link. I also have made a tutorial photo where I included the settings I use for it [here](http://i.imgur.com/yx90n.png). Make sure you open Swagbucks TV through the toolbar so it opens up in a nice new compact window (also prevents captchas from appearing). You can then move the window to the side of your screen and assign the clicks accordingly. [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/gWUXc.png) a picture of what my screen usually looks like so you can get an idea of what I mean. I just leave the Swagbucks TV window open on the right side of the screen with the program running, and I use my computer normally on the left side. The web version of Swagbucks TV will grant you **3 points** per every 10 videos that you watch. Maxing out at a daily total of 150 points.


* Swagbucks TV (mobile) - You can download the app for android [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.swagbuckstvmobile.views&amp;feature=search_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDEsImNvbS5zd2FnYnVja3N0dm1vYmlsZS52aWV3cyJd). Or, unlike the web version of Swagbucks TV, flips through videos automatically. However, you will have to pay attention to the app since you will occasionally be forced to close out of an ad. A little trick if you are running an emulator on the computer: move the progress bar in the app window to be right under the task bar. This will require you to have a transparent task bar, so if you don't [here](http://www.ehow.com/how_8155080_change-taskbars-transparency-windows-7.html) is a guide for Windows 7 on how to change it. Also [Here's](http://i.imgur.com/gWUXc.png) a picture of what I mean. Notice the progress bar of the app at the bottom. If you notice the bar has gone black of missing, there is most likely an ad that you need to exit out of. The mobile version of Swagbucks TV will grant you **2 points** per every 5 videos, and will max out daily at 50 points. I recommend going to the ""comedy"" section of the app since most of the videos there are around 30 seconds.

 **Total**: 200 Swag bucks  **Time**: ~5 minutes (maintenance)


*PollBuzzer* - [Sign up](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=lG4LCEy3W2E8RlhXdWEjEQ%3d%3d)
 &gt; Pollbuzzer is not completely passive

 **Total**: $.07 (average) **Time**: 4 seconds (average)

--------------------------------------------------------------
And there you have it, while the rest is in $50 worth of Amazon gift cards from Swagbucks. If you want to go over an hour a day to make even more every month, I would recommend just dumping all of that time into mTurk. That seems to be the most efficient way to make money after the daily points and limits for Swagbucks have been achieved. I've tried other sites such as NatureBucks and Superpoints, but neither have proven to be a useful consumption of my time.

This will allow you to sign in to all the sites I mention. (Create a new one if you already have a facebook, these applications want you to spam their info and your friends will hate you.) Finally, you may want to download a different web browser than the one you currently use in order to install website toolbars.

1. **I vist Jebbit and do any available campaigns**. –[Ref](http://www.jebbit.com?ref=9470)/[NonRef](http://www.jebbit.com) This site requires that you either have a “.edu” e-mail to login, however, I made only 3.00$ the following 4. They offer the ability to email alert you when 5.00$ worth of campaigns are ready (which may only take you 10 minutes to complete them all). I check this website every day. They payout through WePay (identical to PayPal) with a minimum withdraw of 2.00$ You can link your WePay account to directly deposit this into a checking account.

2. **I visit Superpoints and use the “superlucky button”** – [Ref](http://superpoints.com/refer/rasheemhashmir)/[NonRef](http://superpoints.com) Superpoints is a website that will reward you for doing anything from completing offers (remember to use that new e-mail) to watching videos or taking surveys. I find that my active attention is better spent on other sites, you will be allowed 30 clicks a day. From these clicks, you can earn 1-25+ superpoints. Upon accumulating 1336 points, you can cashout with a 10$ paypal payment. Is this something you’re going to earn overnight? No. It takes me about 5 minutes to click through the button 30 times. If you want to utilize this website further, I read a [good guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/thj1f/the_most_comprehensive_and_detailed_superpoints/) on how to cash out big, fast. 

3. **I visit gifthulk open the treasure chest, I will participate in the daily poll which awards a single coin per day. Finally, I will throw a few searches into the toolbar. Make sure these searches are quality, you will agree to a disclaimer that states nonsensical searches or searches similar in keywords spammed will result in flagging. You will usually get a hit within 3-4 searches and it typically comes in around 6-10 coins, bonus keys or even giftcards. If you find you like the interface, try out some of the other ways of earning. A 5$ PayPal payment costs 599 coins.

4.**I head to SwagBucks and complete the daily poll, this awards 1 SB a day. Afterwards, I click through the NOSO (No obligation special offer). You begin by clicking “Start earning now” and will be bombarded by offers. Skip every single one. At the end of the tunnel of offers you will be awarded 2 SB. Now I’ll do searches in the bar. I abide by the same rules as with GiftHulk, quality searches. I usually win 2-3 times a day and get between 3-10 SB each time. There are countless other ways of earning bucks: streaming video, completing surveys, finishing offers. I will complete a survey or an offer to cap on the daily bonus, but I find that other sites handle task payout better. Here is a [more detailed guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/103f7h/heard_of_swagbucks_but_havent_tried_it_yet_read/) if you’re interested in putting more time into this site.

**The whole time im doing this, you are credited. If you're willing to part with your beloved adblock, this utility can net you 5-10$ a month depending on how heavily you browse the web and to what sites you navigate. Be warned, use of auto refreshing utilities has resulted in bans.

**If you want to supplement this daily routine, you want to do tasks that pay at least 0.10$/1minute. In order to find these well paying HITs, I subscribe to r/hitsworthturkingfor. In this subreddit, users post links to well paying HITs. They will post the name of the Requestor, the title of the hit, the region it applies to and any qualifications you may need. Additionally, a poster may mention a “High TO” this refers to a browser extension called [TurkOpticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/). This extension will display a window when hovering over the requesters name while on the Turk website. This window contains reviews from other users which can flag you of potential scams. I can make 4-5$ an hour using this method. Some days you will find very generous HITs, you will have the option to link to your checking account to receive direct deposit. The Minimum withdraw is ~~15$~~.**Edit: 10$**

I hope you guys draw as much benefit from this as I have. While it is not exactly entire financial freedom

1373776881.0,1i9d3f,How to earn ~50 bucks on Amazon each moth via SwagBucks,nvo8018,95,15,43,"Hi Guys. I wanted to make a quick guide on Swagbucks (SB) to show how to put forth minimal effort and still earn around $50.00 a month. By no means is this maximum you can earn. I’m sure many make more than this

• Tablet/Mobile Device with the Swagbucks Mobile App.
• Swagbucks Toolbar installed (I’d install it on a browser you do not use. Do this for two reasons
• Optional: Multiple Monitors and/or another computer. Screen space is very helpful in earning more SB in a quicker amount of time. You can do many of these offers simultaneously with more screen space.
• Amazon account will be required.

Currently, which averages out to be another ~280-300 swagbucks typically. This is not difficult to achieve.  They are typically credited to your account by the 5th of each month.  Below is what a typical day should look like. I earn around 120-130 SB every single day using the method below.

1. Complete the NOSO/Daily Poll/Toolbar. +4 SB.
2. Turn on your mobile device, you might have to click out of an ad to progress to the next video. +50 SB.
3. Open up two tabs
4. On the second tab, then rinse/repeat. I typically get 3-4 search rewards a day. They usually range from 7 SB- 12 SB, but occasionally I have gotten ~20 SB, and one time I received 40 SB. On sverage this earns me ~25 SB a day. +25 SB
5. After searching, hit the inbox, and sometimes they will be on the banner above the inbox, sort of like an ad. +25 SB
6. Visit SC-S.com periodically to find swagcodes that are worth more SB. I believe you can get these texted to you as well. These are usually random
7. Check the inbox periodically. They send out offers sometimes that can be worth SB. I earn around 70  SB a month for swagcodes.

The more screen space you have, you are at 4475. Add in monthly inbox/swagcodes, and the grand total comes in at approximately 4615 SB. Assuming a 30 day month, this will be just under 4500 SB earned for that month. Spending a bit more time would get you past that 4500 SB mark.  4500 SB easily gets you 40-45 a month, if you put forth a small amounts of extra effort, you can earn 50 a month.

Note: This guide does not address surveys and other “special offers” because I personally haven’t had a great deal of luck or consistency with any of them. I recognize that some do work


Thanks for reading. I hope you enjoy the guide. It's pretty straightforward

1349392754.0,10ypaj,I made about $200 in September through Fiverr and should make closer to $500 in October.  Let me show you how to get started,ZEFninja,107,25,67,"Ok

Fiverr is a place where people pay to get services for $5. The seller actually gets $4 of that (minus paypal fees) and can cash out the 4$ 2 weeks after a job is completed. $4 may not seem much but the biggest value I find with fiverr is that it's a good way to get new clients. They buy a couple gigs for $5 and if you do a good job some will start paying you directly and cutting out the middleman(fiverr). So even if Fiverr went away I am still in business.  Or you can just stick to doing fiverr gigs.

You can sell whatever(legal) service you want for $5 but remember that you really don't want to be spending very much time on each gig. I try and keep it to 15 minutes of actual work per gig. But when you make a new one it will take a bit of time before you streamline it so don't be discouraged if it takes longer at first.

So here is a great method for making Fiverr cash:

Step 1: Earn traffic by having your computer autosurf websites
Step 2: Sell this traffic on Fiverr
Step 3: Profit

Seems simple enough but I will explain things that have taken me a long time to learn and I have not seen talked about anywhere.

Step 1:  Earning traffic.  Autosurf sites allow you to login and have you computer automatically surf other peoples sites.  You get credits for sites surfed.  You can use those credits to get traffic on your own sites(or your fiverr customers).  There are hundreds of these sites but only a few good ones.  It is usually not a 1:1 ratio

You can pretty much set it and forget it (though it's good to check on it once a day because sometimes it will get stuck.) You can run it while you sleep or run it on a spare machine or run it on a VM like I do. If you want to expand from there you just need more IP addresses. I used to run 4 virtual machines at a time each with their own IP and could pump out enough credits to get people thousands of views daily. If I got too many sales I would just buy a few credits and was still making a nice profit.

The best site out the is Hitleap.  It counts credits by ""minute""  so you can send people to your site for 5 seconds up to 60.  Depending on what you need.

Referral Link:  http://hitleap.com/by/Shonnaxe8

Non Referral Link:  http://hitleap.com


Step 2:  Selling the traffic.  After earning (or buying) a bunch of credits you need to decide how you are going to sell the traffic.  Just selling tons of traffic is not really that popular in Fiverr

The easiest sell if for sites that reward you for having more views etc.  Part of youtube rankings have to do with how fast they are getting views.  So it can help them get more legitimate views.  People mostly understand they are not ""real"" visits but they want to get on the ""popular videos"" list and things like that.  Also people like having bragging rights ""Dude my picture got 800 views!"".

Keep in mind it's never a 1 to 1 ratio. Youtube for example likes to wait a bit before showing all of the views and they don't really count every single one. So test it before you make a fiverr gig.

Step 3: Profit.  You have to wait a bit to get your fiverr money but you can get some customers to buy a better deal directly through paypal and you can get your money right away(I have a paypal debit card so that's nice).  It's against Fiverr rules to do this technically but I just hit them up on Youtube or Soundcloud or whatever site and see if they are interested.

Be creative there are a ton of ways to make money with this site alone. If I get a positive response maybe I will regularly give out some ideas. I have been self employed for 5 months now and I want to start helping other people (also the referrals really help me LOL).

Edit:  there seems to be some confusion on a few things so I will update this edit with some more detail when I can.  Either tonight or tomorrow.  Thanks everyone and ask any questions you want

Edit 2 :  Sounds like I have most of the preliminary questions out of the way.  I will make another post where I go into detail on the Fiverr part of it,False,,t5_2s5or,1349455743.0,,,t3_10ypaj

It's like MTurk only it's JUST writing and it pays more. Most people are placed at 3 to start.  You can move up or down after your first 5 assignments when they re-grade you.  After that they check you every 60 articles or so.

I am extremely lazy about Textbroker.  I prefer to build passive income, so I average $7 per day.  However, when I needed to pay a bill by month’s end or wanted a quick influx into Paypal, I’ve been known to crank out over $50 worth of content in a day.

Here is my experience:,Cavemencrazy,111,31,31,"[I started a small candy vending machine route](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rxKiBme9KNs)  I placed machines in five different businesses in my town.  Even though it only brought in about 50 bucks a month

Another idea you might be interested in is while i was in High School [I started my own curb painting business](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0LJj-3X9UkQ).  It was fun

This last one isn’t something I did, who is actually a Redditor (and did an [AMAA](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/vgeuj/iama_cofounder_ceo_at_topline_amaa/) four months ago) wrote a program that replaces the ads you see on web-pages with ads that his business pays you to see. Its an interesting concept.  I calculated that If I spend an hour on the internet every day using his program, Ill end up making 20-30 dollars a year from his business.  [I show you an example in this video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz_iPMk0-YY)  But the awesome part is the guy who started the business is also making money off the ads I see. If his proportion of ad-sharing revenue is similar to Googles Adsense, then he will be making 15-20 dollars off of me during the year.  Talk about easy money.  Props to the creator of Topline.

[quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=f1b3bcf39dd0b2926ddfe827080c139e) or [nonref](http://www.quirky.com/participate) is a website that socializes product ideas and then manufactures the product. To explain that a bit more, and the way it looks. quirky then manufactures it and sells it.

If you voted on an idea that wins, if you have 1% influence on a product that sells for $30, then you get .30 each time it is sold. it takes time to accumulate influence but it is completely passive income after you get that influence. you can get a lot more influence by actually submitting ideas for the product and to develop the product.

This is a link to their song.  On that song page there is a ""share"" button.  Click that and there is ""widget code""

This is my favorite traffic exchange.  Referral Link: http://hitleap.com/by/Shonnaxe8 Non Referral Link: http://hitleap.com

I would set it to a random time visiting a site and no more than 40 visits an hour.  You will get someone their song plays in a couple days.  It helps them look more popular and gets them higher in the charts.

First of all

___________________________________________________________________________


The biggest moneymaker by far

The second biggest moneymaker is the SBTV mobile app. You get **2 points for every 10 videos** you watch, but if you don't you can install the android app emulator [Bluestacks](http://download.cnet.com/BlueStacks-App-Player/3000-18513_4-75593133.html). Once you've installed Bluestacks, install [Gizmo Stack](http://www.gizmostack.co.uk/?q=index) which will enable you to run Bluestacks in windowed mode in the background. Once you've installed those, follow these steps in order to install the SBTV Mobile app.

&gt;1. Download the [SBTV Mobile app from here](http://bitshare.com/?f=mvvv25rw) and put it on your desktop.
&gt;
&gt;2. Navigate to *C:\Program Files (x86)\BlueStacks* and locate the *HD-ApkHandler.exe* file. Right click on it and select Send to &gt; Desktop (create shortcut)
&gt;
&gt;3. Go back to your desktop and drag the *com.swagbuckstvmobile.views-2.apk* file onto your newly created *HD-ApkHandler.exe* shortcut. It should bring up a message showing its installation.
&gt;
&gt;4. After it's finished
&gt;
&gt;Note: the videos will play automatically. I recommend playing videos from the Comedy Time playlist because these tend to be the shortest.

____________________________________________________________________________________


Now if you max out both of these every day, if you want to cash out faster, there are a ton of ways to pick up extra points all throughout the site. This is what I do:

* Always remember to to the Daily Poll **(1pt)** and the NOSO **(2pts)**. These are daily guaranteed points and while 3 points might not sound like a lot

* Check your messages daily. Every day they send out a quick video poll in a message titled ""Earn 3 Swagbucks Today"" It takes less than 5 seconds to complete and is another guaranteed **3 points per day**. They expire after 1 day though

* Check the Gambit tab under the ""Special Offers"" section of the Earn menu. They have a video section that has anywhere from **0-20 videos a day** that you can watch for **1 point each**. This uses the same exact system that Superpoints uses for their videos

* While in the Special Offers section

* Sometimes on Swagbucks' homepage

* Another way to make a couple of points is from their Games section of the Earn menu. Bring up any game, awarding you **2 points**. I haven't tested this very much, so I don't know what the limit is here, but it's a low maintenance way of making a few extra points every day if you're desperate.~~

According to [sandysquirrel](http://swagbucks.com/refer/paintedwombat)

&gt;* ""You actually only have to wait about a minute


* Under the Trusted Surveys section of the Earn menu

* If you have time, even if you do get disqualified, Swagbucks gives you **one point per failed survey up to 5 every day**.

* Remember to search through their search engine multiple times per day. Winning at a search will usually give you around **7-13 points**, and people generally only win **2-3 times per day**. Regardless, it is still a great way of earning points.

* If you have trouble remembering to search daily, but it greatly increases your chance at winning.

* Set up text message alerts for Swag Codes. Swag Codes are special codes randomly given out by the Swagbucks team that give you free points just for entering them into the box on the homepage. They are usually worth from **3-16 points**

* Use your wishlist! While this isn't a tip about getting points, so you won't miss if something you want goes on sale.

And last but not least, they can definitely help you rake in quite a bit if done correctly. I only have **2 active referrals**, but they have made me **over 700 points** so far. (The most being from tokarrai, whose referral link is [here](http://swagbucks.com/refer/tokarrai) if you want to help him out.) Remember though, you only get points from their searches, so be sure to properly educate your referrals about the search function of the site.

One way that doesn't seem to have been mentioned very much is [Justanswers](http://www.justanswer.com/professional).  There are many different categories that you can sign up for as an expert, so there is definitely a substantial amount of money to be made if you are accepted as an expert.  I personally have been working there for over a year now and my income has varied, but I do regularly make several hundred dollars a month.  It can be a grind, but it also has to be one of the most profitable work from home types of websites that I've come across.

Like most people here I also use swagbucks [Refer](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/bugabugabuga) [Non-refer](http://www.swagbucks.com).  Unlike many people, it does net me the equivalent of about 10-50 cents a day for doing something I would be doing anyway.  I do the daily poll, and the noso.  All of this takes very minimal time for me.  I accumulate the points and spend them on amazon gift cards.  Very easy.

Many years ago I signed up for one of these survey sites called SurveySavvy [refer](http://www.surveysavvy.com/?m=3036858) [non-refer](http://www.surveysavvy.com).  To my knowledge this is still one of the best survey sites in terms of making passive income from referrals.  The surveys themselves don't interest me too much, although that has only happened to me once so far.  If you don't mind filling out surveys and you can get a few people under you to fill them out too, it's definitely possible to make some money, although the payout checks do take forever to be delivered.  I constantly get survey invitations from them, so there's no shortage of that.

Other than that I've tried just about everything out there with very limited success.  I've recently decided to try two new sites after reading about them here on reddit.  

I just signed up for an account at clixsense [refer](http://www.clixsense.com/?5153727) [non-refer](http://www.clixsense.com) which I understand is also one of the better sites similar to swagbucks.  It has been mentioned on reddit quite a bit

One of the most intriguing sites I have found recently is quirky [non-refer](http://www.quirky.com/).  I can't find a referral link, and if they make it all the way to creation you get a small percentage of passive income based on the units they sell.  Seems too good to be true, but people seem to have made money on it so I'm going to give it a try.  

That's what I've been up to.  I'd be interested in hearing any other ideas that aren't gigantic time sinks.  I keep seeing that people use mturk, so please send them my way if you have a good site that hasn't been mentioned and isn't a scam or a total waste of time.  Thanks!

1355333361.0,14qf9j,Scrap metal 101,foxpoint,82,10,45,"I've gotten a few good ideas from /r/beermoney so I decided to pay it forward and write a guide to scrap metal. You'll need a truck or a decent sized trailer. I paid $600 for a used trailer. It can haul about a ton which makes me about $100-$150 depending on what junk metal is going for. A good trailer is either an open or dump trailer. This will make unloading much easier.

**IDENTIFY A SCRAP YARD**


The most important step is locating a good scrap yard in your area that pays top dollar. Shop around to see who has the best prices. Look for something close so you don't spend a lot of money on gas. Some scrap yards try to take advantage of new people. If you want to test a scrap yard save up your aluminum cans. Weigh the cans before you go. If they are off by a lot you will know they are ripping you off.

**SORTING THE SCRAP FOR MAX PROFIT**


The best way to recycle is to reuse the product in its current form. If you can sell something out of your scrap steel pile for $15 you just made the same as scrapping 100 lbs. of metal.

While sorting you also want to look for things that are more valuable types of metals. For instance


**SPECIFIC PRODUCTS TO LOOK FOR**


**Copper $3.00 - $4.00 lb.**

* Electric motors (around 0.20 -0.30 a lb. for these
* Cable
* Electrical Wire (cars
* Plumbing

**Brass**

* Valves
* Plumbing

**Aluminum $0.50 lb.**

* Siding
* Boats
* Grill Lids
* Equipment Housings
* Cylinder Heads
* Machine Parts
* Gutters
* Lawn chairs
* Old Fences
* Patio Furniture
* Old Ladders
* Old Pots
* Certain tools
* Storm door and window frames
* Beverage cans
* Disposable cooking pans &amp; foil etc.

**Lead - price varies**

* Car Batteries ($5 a pop at my scrap yard)
* Old Computer Monitors (some places will charge you for these so make sure before you pick a bunch up)
	
**Scrap Steel - $10 - $15 (per 100 lb.)**

* Anything that is magnetic
* Furnaces
* Boilers
* Washers
* Dryers
* Stoves
* Refrigerators (must be empty of freon)

	
The price of scrap metal constantly changes. If you have the space you can store metal until prices go back up. Storing a bunch of scrap steel takes a lot of room so I just take this whenever I have a trailer full.  I sort my other metals in buckets and wait until prices are high. At first it might be tough for you to find sources of metal but as the word gets out people will start saving it for you. I have one guy who has a giant pit that he throws all his metal in. I stop by once a year and unload it for him. The first time I went I dug about 12 electric motors out of that pit. Another good source is college houses. College kids tend to buy beer in aluminum cans because it is cheaper. I stop by once every two months to collect and they normally have several bags of crushed cans waiting for me. 


The best way to make money doing this is to pair it with another profession. For instance

I've been doing this a couple years now but I'm not an expert. I'd love to hear ideas anyone else might have to make money with scrap metal.

1353471878.0,13jswz,Want More Than Just Beer Money?,uologan,86,18,15,"I will try to make this short and simple. A few years ago I had an 'oh shit' moment when my left leg mysteriously stopped working the way it should. It was lethargic

The bills were piling up I was shitted. Then one day I noticed our neighbor was cleaning out his garage and he was setting stuff out at the curb. I swear I saw a guitar case. I scooped it up and brought it inside. When I opened the case inside was a sweet takamine acoustic guitar with electric pick ups. It was in kinda rough shape but I cleaned it up and ended up getting $100 bucks for it on craigslist. After that I was on a mission. 

I live in Charlotte NC and a few hours ago there was a listing under FREE for [sweet set of 8 gym lockers](http://charlotte.craigslist.org/zip/3424284903.html) If I had a truck I could easily score at the very least $100 just by selling them back on craigslist. Again just today there were 125 chairs the kind you might find in a diner all for free. If you wanted to dump them for $5 per you made a killing and could drink beer the rest of the week. 

They have free firewood all the time and the pieces are often small enough to load a trunk down if you don't have a truck. Sell it for $35 delivered. There are also all the time little things for free like end tables that you can dump quickly for $15-$20 depending on condition. You just have to kind of all the time check the free stuff on craigslist. Maybe cruise some nice neighborhoods on trash night. Apartment complexes the end of the month where people move in a hurry and just dump half their belongings. 

I hope you get the picture I could go on and on but I really hope it helps someone score some extra cash the way it did me.

1.**Free My Apps**:
One of the better apps out there
Go-to the link on your IOS device's web browser or search free my apps on the google play store for android to install the app


[Referal](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/email/3eccd887)  [Non ref](http://m.freemyapps.com) 


2.**Feature points**: Decently high paying app, up to 100 dollars paypal and many apps. To install simply navigate to the feature points link in your device's web browser.

[ref](https://featurepoints.com/r/TJTEDR) or enter the ref code TJTEDR in the app [non-ref](https://featurepoints.com)

3.**App nana's**: very similar to feature points except it sometimes has more apps and offers. The rewards however do not go up by even increments ex. 1$ amazon is 30

[link](http://www.appnana.com) Input the invite code a204585 for an extra 2500 points right off the bat.

4.**App Casher**: very similar to feature points. Apps typically pay out 200 points and it takes 2000 for a two dollar card


[ref](http://www.appcasher.com/m?&amp;r=367316&amp;s=email) or enter the code 367316 for 500 points
[non-ref](http://www.appcasher.com)

5.**FreeAppSlot**: a different concept than from the other reward programs you receive spins on a slot machine which nets you points for every spin. Points can range from winning 100 in a spin to winning thousand. Rewards include apps

[ref](http://freeappslots.com?refcode=55rylhui) [non-ref](http://freeappslots.com)


6.**Appbounty**: extremely similar to Free my Apps although there are only rewards in itunes cards available. The high paying apps net you around 200 points and a 10$ itunes card is 5000. I assume there may be more rewards added in the future. To install simply goto the link in your device's web browser. Signing up with the referal link gives you 50 points from the start.

[ref](http://abo.io/exaxtg) [non ref](http://abo.io)

7.**Junowallet**: same idea as all the other apps except it has offers directly from offer walls and you get paid to juno credits in which 1$ dollar juno credits is worth 1$ in the selected gift card from which a multitude are availible from their partner app bamboo wallet which you can get off the appstore

[link](http://m.junowallet.com) Enter the invite code WM568987 in your profile to receive a 50 cent bonus.

8.**Apptrailers and Appredeem**: Apptrailers (on the app store for both IOS and android) is an app that pays you to watch trailers of apps and sometimes for installing them

[link](http://m.appredeem.com)



Note: almost all of these apps will require you to install a profile

1365095693.0,1bo72e,Making Bitcoins for beer money,lightsaberon,82,19,28,"**Note: This is about getting bitcoins without mining them

[News](http://money.cnn.com/2013/04/03/investing/bitcoin-price/index.html) about [bitcoin mania](http://www.reddit.com/r/TrueReddit/comments/1blooj/as_economies_grow_the_money_supply_has_to_be_able/) and [related crazy shit](http://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/18f3pd/i_have_my_entire_retirement_and_savings_invested/) have been cropping up on reddit

It was basically designed to be a digital online currency.  A bit like reddit karma, probably.  Bitcoins are untouchable (so far), but are volatile and so their value can fluctuate heavily, but no one can help themselves to your bitcoins (unless you get [hacked](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/hzrcc/bitcoin_user_loses_25k_bitcoins_when_his_machine/)).  Make sure to keep your bitcoin wallet [safe](http://www.reddit.com/r/geek/comments/hzrcc/bitcoin_user_loses_25k_bitcoins_when_his_machine/c1zppkb) if you somehow do manage to make non-trivial amounts of the stuff.

They are very convenient and kind of fun though.  For example

One thing about most bitcoin beer money sites is that, in any country.

**First step:**
Get yourself a bitcoin client, Macs and Linux computers.  You can also get an online client called [My Wallet](https://blockchain.info/wallet/new), which is compatible with iphones, Android phones, Windows, Macs and Linux.

People used to mine bitcoins using their computers, bitcoin mining rigs.

**Free Bitcoin Sites:**

* [Daily Bitcoins](http://dailybitcoins.org/index.php?aff=e2d0e972c7780b4e2d1d4d951ef4e191) ([nf](http://dailybitcoins.org))

* [CoinAd](https://coinad.com?r=10094)  - Free bitcoins every hour ([nf](https://coinad.com)).

* [BitCrate](http://www.bitcrate.net/index.php?ref=1373) - You can purchase reddit gold here using bitcoins ([nf](http://www.bitcrate.net)) .

* [BitCoiner](http://bitcoiner.net)

* [CoinReaper](http://coinreaper.com/) - Saves some time by helping you to fill in your address on multiple free bitcoin sites.

* [Bunny Run](http://bunnyrun.us/) - Watch an ad then win varying amount of bitcoins.

* [Hartcode](http://www.hartcode.com/wallpaper/vote) - Vote for your favourite wallpaper.

* [Coin Love Chest](https://www.btcvillage.nl/coinlovechest) - You have to tweet your love for bitcoin to get free bitcoins.


**Earn Bitcoins** - these are sites where you can earn bitcoins by doing some online work like visiting websites, etc.  You can obviously make more money from these sites than the more simple free ones:

* [Bit Visitor](http://www.bitvisitor.com/?ref=1EWKXjyM1BrjpngKQskehNqJRT4UmhqcJX) - Visit websites to earn money ([nf](http://www.bitvisitor.com)) .

* [Coin Tube](http://www.cointube.tv/?ref=1EWKXjyM1BrjpngKQskehNqJRT4UmhqcJX)  - Watch TV to make bitcoins ([nf](http://www.cointube.tv)).

* [BitCoin4You](http://www.bitcoin4you.net/) - Earn bitcoins for visiting websites (some 18+).

* [Bitcoin Get](http://bitcoin.chromaticcreative.net/?r=wj9r6MINfzmp)  - Earn bitcoins by reading websites and answering questions about them ([nf](http://bitcoin.chromaticcreative.net)).

**Gaming Sites:**

Didn't want to post any links to gambling or gaming sites

* [BitVegas](http://bitvegas.net) - A casino built entirely within the [MineCraft](http://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft/) world.  You can play standard games like roulette and blackjack

I found myself trying to game some of the sites. I ran several scripts that automated some of the viewing sites, ultimately, a ban. I knew the risk I was running and when it finally ended, I was not upset: it was more money that I had hoped for so little work.

I have seen ""cheat"" tips in this subreddit for quite awhile, might as well get in on it. If they go out of business, so what.""

Every possible scenario has happened since. I've made hundred of dollars from some sites (both legitimately and illegit) and wasted hours on others without payout. I've been banned

But over the past few months, and to maybe find solace in sharing my ban.

What I saw there was very sad: hundreds of people, some were students, some needed more income... comments read that a few individuals spent 9 hours a day clicking on SBTV. People freaked out about codes not working, prizes taking too long to post, and outrage when accounts were banned ""for no reason"".

I've also seen some disturbing trends here on the subreddit. People posting titles about how the *need* money

Trust me, and these sites aren't going save you from anything. 

Someone posted a cheat the other day and there were basically two kinds of negative responses:

* if you need money so bad you should get a job
* if you cheat theyre going to make it harder to make money for the rest of us

These are contradictary. One is wondering why you are so desperate to make money. The other is desperate to make money.

I don't think we can deter cheating from this subreddit alone. There will always be cheaters. Any one knows that if their is an opportunity, but it is ultimately up to the website to create a system that checks and balances the userbase. 

... I hate how I just used to word system

I wanted to get your guys' opinions on this... but I mainly wanted to tell you guys' not to beat yourselves up over it. It is (literally) just a few bucks you're fighting over. There's been name-calling

I love this subreddit because it has been one of the most supportive and informative ones on this site. People here are unbelievably clever and helpful

Thanks. -db

**edit:** thank you all for contributing to this. I am actually giving up on these beermoney sites to spend more time on other stuff

I'm not going to defend my opinion further (and thus, and people will always need some and want more.

The one everyone uses.  Getting a $5 gift card was very nice considering the work put into it.

**Cashcrate           $50**

This is the main GPT site I use.  I love it because its simple and the surveys are decently fast to complete.  It doesn't have as many offers as something like swagbucks but it keeps me focused on doing only a couple things without having so many that I get lost.  1-2 surveys a day has turned into $50 for the month.

[**Opinion Outpost**](http://www.opinionoutpost.ca/)
Opinion Outpost would have to be my favorite site for the simple fact that I have made the most cash off of it. I check this site several times a day because there are always new surveys available. I even sometimes click refresh a couple of times and a survey will appear even though it had just told me a second ago there were none available. I started using this site on March 17th 2013 and have made $99 dollars thus far.  So on average $1.4 per day (99/72=1.375).
**Min Payout:** Varies (10 points = $1)
**Rewards:** Alawar (30 points)

[**Tellwut**](http://www.tellwut.com/)
Tellwut has to be one of my favorite sites too, but some cost more than others. So on average $0.77 per day (55/71=0.7746).
**Min Payout:** Varies (4000 points = Approx $10)
**Rewards:** Amazon (4000 points=$10), Home Depot (4,500 points=$10), Tango (4,500 points=$10), Wal-Mart (10,000= $25).


[**Global Test Market**](https://www.globaltestmarket.com/)
Global Test Market is a fairly decent site as well.  It is strictly a survey site, but they said Paypal is going to be an option very soon.
**Min Payout:** 1000 points ($50)
**Rewards:** Cash 

[**My Survey**](https://www.mysurvey.ca/)
I am fairly new to My Survey so far I like it.  This is a survey-based site as well. I find that I don’t get that many surveys but they seem to pay fairly well. I joined the site on May 3rd.  So far I have earned 2840 points. $10 dollars is roughly equal to 1100 points.  So on average $1 (25/25=1).
**Min Payout:** 1100 points ($10)
**Rewards:** Paypal

[**I-Say**]( http://www.i-say.com/)
I have been using I-Say for a while now. I really like the platform of the site and how it runs. I find that they give me quite a few surveys and are usually worth 45-90 cents each. I joined this site March 20th and since then have earned 3615 points. 100 points is equal to $1. So on average $0.52 per day (36.15/69=0.5239).
**Min Payout:** Paypal($15) 
**Rewards:**  Amazon, Lots more.

Since March 15th using all these sites and few others I have made roughly 300 dollars in cash and gift cards from all these sites. This is not bad considering I do not spend much time on weekends doing this. It averages out to be about $4 a day.  This is by no means any way to get rich

The market research firm recruiting for the study agreed to make a donation to [my fundraising efforts with the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society](http://pages.teamintraining.org/sf/ambbr13/daveandrade) for each qualified applicant I referred to them. 

Due to the absolutely massive and overwhelming response from Reddit

**As a result of this unexpected success, because I recently received this email from Pam Lintner, Schlesinger Associates' VP of Research:

&gt; *Hi Dave

&gt; *I gladly will donate to your team’s donation without hesitation.  I also need to do some math as I might owe you more than the $1K I budgeted simply because I didn’t anticipate this kind of response.   Should I owe you

&gt; *All my best*
&gt; *Pam*

For all of those who participated or at least took the time to complete the pre-screener for the survey -- thank you! This wouldn't have been possible without a bit of time and effort on your part. And I'm sure you'll be putting the extra money from the study to good use :D

Hopefully, I'll be sure to pass them along :)

Not me. I spend my daily (sometimes more) poop sessions making money. Now you may be asking yourself

**I want to be like you. What can I do?** Well

* Sell your plasma

* Save up your *heart* earned money to get an android phone or an iPhone.

* Search that sonnovabitch for an app called ""Junowallet.""

* Eat.

* Digest.

* Excrete.

* Open up Junowallet and watch short videos or download apps

* ???

* Profit

When you open up the app you'll be like ""what in the hell is this?"" But then you'll realize

Each video you watch will reward you after you watch it for 13 seconds. 

That's right. For every minute you spend pooping you can get anywhere from 4.6 cents to 9.2 cents or so.

**But

Every 13 seconds is 1 to 2 cents. That means that for every minute you're on the crapper you'll receive 4.6 to 9.2 cents or so.

Now you may be thinking, some less, but either way - free money.

**tell me more!** No. **Please!?** Fine.
You can also use this app to download apps for cash money.  You can do this on the toilet as well. 

**How long will it take to get my giftcards?** 24 hours dude
 
**What's the minimum payment** It depends on the giftcard.  Amazon is 5 bucks.

**Is there anything else I should know?** Yes

**What's the referral system like?**  Dude

**Is there anything else I should know?** Nope. Carry on.

Now everyone go get some Taco Bell

So first I'll just describe what I do on all the sites on a day to day basis

* Paid to read e-mails - This is what I first started with a few years ago.  I get around 5-15 e-mails in my inbox that I have filtered to go to a certain folder.  At the end of the day, and bam...instant money in seconds.  So easy.

* Free points, or clicking on a certain area of their site every day.  It takes seconds and will inevitably add up over time for doing almost nothing.  

* Videos - Watch 30 second - 4 minute commercials

* Surveys - These pay out big compared to everything else

* Mechanical turk.  If you are familiar with this site, but I think you make the same amount on either site.

* Searches - This is a really easy way to make points.  I use Chrome pretty much exclusively, and I just go down the list about 3x a day (morning, afternoon, night).  Some sites you get paid for a certain amount of searches per month, and some up to 3x per day.  I have Ghostery installed as well, but I haven't noticed any issues.  A key thing here is that you do not have to click on any sponsored links (or any links at all) to get points.  And again, I don't even use the browser for anything but this.  I make somewhere around $0.01 to well over .20 per site this way.

* Shopping - Ok, or Gap, or anything like that..I just make sure to check to see if one of the 5 sites has referral links.  Most of the time one of them does, and the payout has been usually somewhere between $2.00-$10.00, but depending on your purchase price it may be way above that.

* Grocery Coupons, and once you scan it at the register, 5 or 6 weeks later you get $0.05 to $0.10 per coupon.  I actually just noticed the Movie Tickets option, which looks legit as you go through Fandango.  Not sure how much you get back.

Anyways


* [Zoombucks](http://www.zoombucks.com/join.php?ref=mgrmgr85) - Free points, Surveys, Videos, Mechanical Turk, Grocery Coupons, Movie Tickets
* [Cashcrate](http://www.cashcrate.com/2006483) - Free points, Searching

* MyPoints (message me with your e-mail if you want me to refer you to this one) - Paid E-mails, Grocery Coupons

Hope these can be helpful to you guys.  Let me know if you have any other questions or want me to go into more detail on a particular site

Also, I'm almost to the point that I have enough to cash out my points and get my first $20 Amazon code from Zoombucks, AND I am finally, finally at $30.00 at InboxDollars which means they will be sending me a check this month.  So, you see...not bad for bs-ing around for half an hour a day.

To make extra money, barbeque sauce, napkins, baby lotion and salad dressing to test out, all for free, I did not even have to pay for shipping.

I make about a hundred dollars a month doing this and it's all very easy. Boring, and you tell them if you liked it or not. Those surveys are actually really fun, and I am grateful to get paid for doing them.

I have been doing this for about six months now and have made about six hundred dollars (I am pretty effecient and do about 3-5 surveys daily though, and you get a small amount back for using thier search engine). 

Here are some links to legit sites where you can make a little extra income. I will be upfront and let you know that I am posting my referral links in hopes of being helped out too, my part time job only pays bills and groceries and I'd like to be able to go out to dinner once in a while or buy a little something for myself :D

I hope that I can help you guys out

I am on many other sites too, and you can see on thier walls that they have many happy users that get paid and earn cash and prizes. Swagbucks for instance, has over a million facebook fans. I promise all these sites are legit.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Here are some tips I have learned since I have started:**

* Save the sites to your favorites so you can access them easily and so you won't forget about any of them.

* Create a ""survey taking"" email to sign up to all these sites (because some sites will send you a few surveys everyday and they can start piling up fast).

* Surveys come and go fast! When you see a survey in your email

* If the website has a facebook or twitter, limited offers, easy offers, etc. Also, many of thier facebook walls are full of helpful members who will help you out if needed.

* If you ever come across a site that claims it pays $20-50 per survey

* In fact


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Information about the different sites:**

Sometimes Swagbucks

Crowdtap is a bit different than the other survey sites

Besides earning money, and playing the same video game formula time after time, let them know. It's all market research and they want to know what you think.

**MTurk** - [Register](https://www.amazon.com/gp/aws/ssop/index.html?awscbctx=&amp;awscbid=urn%3Aaws%3Asid%3A027Y0TCSPRG5XHFYJSR2&amp;awscredential=&amp;awsnoclientpipeline=true&amp;awsstrict=false&amp;awsturknosubway=true&amp;wa=wsignin1.0&amp;wctx=&amp;wreply=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mturk.com%3A443%2Fmturk%2Fendsignin&amp;wtrealm=urn%3Aaws%3Asid%3A027Y0TCSPRG5XHFYJSR2&amp;awssig=yZwe4P9pATXcyDaYEFCDKycNYIM%3D) - Probably everyone knows about it. It has something for everyone: if you want to do only surveys, there’s plenty for everyone. However, you have to know how to find those HITs that are indeed worth turking for. My strategy? I knock out everything I can find on the HWTF section, then I search for anything that I’m qualified for and is over one dollar. After that, I search again for “survey” or “study” that pay not less than 25 cents. Bu doing this, I can easily earn about $100 each week with about two hours of turking each day. You can use your money either to buy Amazon gift cards or transfer them into your bank account. Easy-peasey.

**Topline** - [Ref]( https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=YW3WV6Y5L9TL) | [Non-ref]( https://www.jointopline.com) - This is the purest passive earner there is. The principle is this: you sign up, huh? Vewy. They have a point-based system and for each website you visit that incorporates ads you get one point. For every 1000 points, you get $0.75. It may not sound as much, but given the fact that you do nothing is convincing enough, at least for me. Also, the minimum cashout is at $10, which can be achieved in about 2-3 months of surfing, for each referral you earn 5% of the points they earn. The money can be cashed out to PayPal.

**NeoBux** - [Ref]( http://www.neobux.com/?r=ZniperD) | [Non-ref](http://www.neobux.com/) - A very intriguing PTC (Paid-to-Click) website. If you’re not familiar with the concept, during which you get a sum of money based on how many clicks they have each day. Of course, there is the classical concept of direct referrals too, but, obviously, you don’t earn much from them, unless you get to have a large base of active referrals. Anyway, because you get to make decisions like recycling a certain referral if they have bad stats or adding more time to their renting period and so on. Also, is welcome anytime). Anyway

**ClixSense** - [Ref](http://www.clixsense.com/?4043460) | [Non-ref](http://www.clixsense.com/) - Another PTC website, it incorporates the CrowdSource working platform, so you have work to do 24/7, even if the pay is not that good. If you get a decent number of direct referrals, you just have to click your ads every day (takes a few minutes) and that's it. Also, there are offers to complete, plus a nice mini-game called ClixGrid - very much like Neobux' AdPrize, Payza

**Naturebucks** - [Ref]( http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=Zniper) | [Non-ref]( http://naturebucks.com/members/register)  - NatureBucks is a pretty straight-forward website. Here, [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/naturebucksbestof) on reddit. Anyway, by completing those offers you earn either cash or points, which can be eventually transformed into cash too. The minimum withdraw is of only 5 cents to Paypal, or $1 for Amazon gift cards. Also, the 5-tier referral system is great if you can get a decent number of direct referrals, because you earn 20% from your level 1-5 referrals.

**NatureGPT** - [Ref]( http://naturegpt.com/members/register.php?ref=ZniperD) | [Non-ref]( http://naturegpt.com/) It’s pretty much like Naturebucks. You have a list of offers (mostly surveys) you can complete for either cash or points. Somehow, bur only one time per referral, plus, of course 20% of what they earn next. You can then withdraw your cash to Paypal or use it to buy Amazon gift cards. The minimum payout is $2, which is decent enough in my opinion.

**PaidViewpoint** - [Ref]( http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=64nijt) | [Non-ref]( http://paidviewpoint.com)  - Another survey site. Their surveys don’t pay very much, but if you complete a survey every now and then they will start pilling up. However, the minimum payout is of $25 to Paypal, which can be a bit disappointing for some of you. 

**Pollbuzzer** - [Ref](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=M5Yn84b9dMzNu1nB9og%2fJQ%3d%3d) | [Non-ref]( http://pollbuzzer.com)- Very nice survey site. There are not any offers available, which is definitely worth the time, even if there’s not much to do. You can cash out your earnings to PayPal.  Also, each time one of your referrals answers 4 of these polls you get one dollar.

**CloudCrowd** - [Ref](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/l1clvw) | [Non-ref](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/) - It's a pretty good cloud working platform. You don't always find too much work to do, depending on what type of writing you want to do. I only applied for the marketing credential myself only once, and was rejected because I rushed through it and did a poor job, but I'm sure it's not that hard to get it. Also, they payrate for writers is decent enough, varying from 3 to 5 cents per written word, if your work is accepted. Furthermore, but you can easily knock out a few bucks a day if you stick with it for, which is easy and generally well-paid. There is no minimum payout; they will automatically transfer your earnings to your PayPal account every day.

Each day I do a few HITs on Amazon Mechanical Turk. I'm trying to get up to about 10 a day

------

### After I complete a HIT

[http://hitsworthturkingfor.blogspot.com/](http://hitsworthturkingfor.blogspot.com/)


The idea behind it is that I hope others will be able to see these every day and make a few extra bucks by completing the HITs that pay you the best for your time.


I see that many of you have a routine or goal to make a few extra dollars each day. My blog is not going to make you rich

------

### A little back-story for those wondering why I'm doing this:

I'm not rich by any means, and then immediately did a month long 1200 mile bicycle trip. Then did some traveling to see friends and family that I had always wanted to see but could never ""find the time.""


My next journey starts in 4 months - I'll be going to South America for two years starting in April. For the moment though, that does some good in the world. 


This site is my very attempt at just that. There are a lot of people who just don't know or don't have the tools to make money, I did some research and traveled down this niche. This is a start, of course. I intend to add more to the blog, hopefully things that provide better opportunities, things that will inspire and change people's lives. But, I wanted to start with a legitimate way to make money online, because it's one of those taboo areas of the internet where everyone seems to be scamming you or wanting your money. That said, my blog is ad-supported

**Description I had on the Chrome Web Store before taking off:**

This will select a random time interval between 54 and 95 seconds

It stops if a Captcha should pop up, so you don't have to keep checking back to it. When it hits 90%, you will be getting either a Captcha (causing the script to auto-stop), or simply be awarded, which will cause the script to keep going.

Tested watching the Reuters News videos. Once you have a video playing, then re-enable (via the right-click, not through the Extensions screen).

**Active Sources**

**[Constant Content]( https://www.constant-content.com/?aref=85056) l [non] (https://www.constant-content.com/)**

This is a content mill site.  However it is one of the more open ended ones.  You can either take on jobs writing for specific people or you can write about whatever you want and hope someone buys it.  I generally do both.  Each day I try and write one article for someone and one article about a topic I enjoy.  This gives me a good base of articles to sell over time and some steady income each day.  

**2-3 Hours

**[Web Answers] (http://www.webanswers.com/_answer32/) l [non] (http://www.webanswers.com/)**

I know a lot of people that work on WebAnswers.  Believe me; this one starts out really slow.  A ton of my friends have already given up.  However that is because they get their 50 questions answers, you won’t make more than a few cents each month.  However, I do this in my down time.  When I am thinking about other things or revising a different article.  I have Webanswers up all day and whenever I have a moment I go find a question or 2 to answer.  Over the course of most days I answer about 10 questions.  This gives me about 300 answers each month.  Eventually I began earning good money and now the 5-10 minutes I spend on the site earn me about $5 a day.

**5-10 Minutes

**[CashCrate] (http://www.cashcrate.com/4812602) l [non] (http://www.cashcrate.com/)**

I also do a few passive income sites.  I am already at my computer so why not.

**[Digital Generation] (http://coingeneration.com/auth/new/347571/) l [non] (http://coingeneration.com/)**

Digital Generation basically runs in the background using my computer resources and pays me about $1 each day.  By signing up you get a 30 day trial period.  After that you have to buy a subscription for $50 to continue earning.  I would not recommend spending your own money on it

**$1**

**[Locket] (http://getlocket.com/r/?48660719) l [non] (http://getlocket.com/)**

I have this program on my android phone.  They pay you about $0.03 an hour for unlocking your phone.  I am constantly on my phone so this is really free money.  Just download the program and let it run.  It’s pretty unobtrusive and just replaces your lock screen with advertisements.

**$0.30**

I average about 3-4 hours of work every day.  I generally make between $30 and $60 on a daily basis.  I suggest you give some of these sites a try if you are interested in building some extra income.  You won’t become rich overnight

Payment is through a visa jingit card or you can redeem for musicme credit. You have to pay $3 for the card which simply comes from your earnings. But that is just a one off payment and is then re-loadable instantly. You can stick as little as a penny on it from your jingit account if you want.

One thing to mention is the earnings limit of $10 per week. But there's only been an occasional time when I've hit the limit so it shouldn't affect you drastically. You can raise the limit through referrals

Not me.  I spend my daily (sometimes more) poop sessions making money.  Now you may be asking yourself

**I want to be like you. What can I do?**  Well

1.  Sell your plasma 
2.  Save up your heart earned money to get an android phone or an iPhone.
3.  Search that sonnovabitch for an app called ""apptrailers.""
4.  Eat.
5.  Digest.
6.  Excrete.
7.  Open up apptrailers and watch short advertisements
8.  ???
9.  Profit

When you open up the app you'll be like ""what in the hell is this?""
But then you'll realize

Each video you watch will give you a 15 second or 30 second advertisement before the trailer begins.  -As soon as the trailer begins you can exit right out of the video and still claim your points for it.

That's right.  For every minute you spend pooping you can get anywhere from 10 to 20 points.

**But

Every 10 points is 1 cent.  That means that for every minute you're on the crapper you'll receive 1 to 2 cents.  Now you may be thinking, some less, but either way - free money.

**tell me more!**  No.
**Please!?** Fine.

Ok.  You can also use the program or it's sister program - Appredeem - to download apps for points.  You can do this on the toilet as well.  Your points are shared between the apps as well.

**How long will it take to get my money through paypal?** Less than a minute dude

1320180529.0,lwuhh,Summary of my favorite websites ($170.54 earned this month),leidermeister,54,5,43,"I wanted to give a review of my $170.54 earnings for the past month for any new readers. 

A little over a month ago I stumbled on beermoney and became heavily involved in checking out a bunch of different sites mentioned. I have found a handful of sites to be the best
The main ways I earn are surveys, fake name, address, and phone number, and never entering credit card or SSN info. Here is what I found to work the best:


**[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/)**

Swagbucks is awesome. I visit it daily for 1/2-1hour. I use SwagbucksTV with an auto-refresh extension*. 

I keep it running in a separate tab for most of the day. I also do the daily poll, *Gambit* videos, *RadiumOne*, *Paymentwall*, *Peanut Labs* surveys and videos, and *SponsorPay*. Swagbuck's search is another great way to earn. Lastly referring others are always a great way to earn, but I do not have any active referrals.
 
**Total earnings: $36.00**

*recently the newer videos require a captcha

ref-link: http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/alock808


**[Superpoints](http://www.superpoints.com/)**

Superpoints is very similar to Swagbucks, and watch videos. The offers that have worked the best for me are *TrailPay* surveys, *RadiumOne*, and *PaymentWall*. And you can earn points from Swagbucks and Superpoints for the same offers as long as a different email address is used. Referrals again are great if you can get them. I have 10 for Superpoints, just enough to earn a platinum status which gives me extra SuperLucky Button pushes. 

**Total earnings: $30.58** ($25 cashout with no referrals

ref-link: http://superpoints.com/refer/yur_too_late

(more links at bottom)


**[Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)**

Amazon's Mechanical Turk is by far the best way to earn, transcriptions, and usability testing. I use it 4-5 days a week for 1-3hours. 

**Total earnings: $84.06**

**[CashCrate](http://www.cashcrate.com/)**

Similar to Swagbucks and Superpoints. I use it daily 10-45mins. I complete offers

**Total Earnings: $18.63** ($20 cashout)

ref-link: http://www.cashcrate.com/3191363/

**[Opinion Outpost](http://www.opinionoutpost.com/)**

I have just recently started using Opinion Outpost, but the website is worth checking.

**[NeoBux](http://www.neobux.com/)**

NeoBux is a ad-click website, so I will be experimenting with that. 

**Total Earnings: $.57**

ref-link: http://www.neobux.com/?r=alock808

**[Gomez Peer](https://www.gomezpeerzone.com/login.aspx)**

Gomez peer is a passive program I leave running in the background

**Total Earnings: $.70**

**Others**

Apply for a job with [LionBridge](http://en-us.lionbridge.com/Default.aspx?LangType=1033)
[SurveySavvy](https://www.surveysavvy.com/ss/ss_index.php?action=home) is just like Opinion Outpost
[Vagex](http://vagex.com/?ref=58273) is also popular

I did not find [InboxDollars](http://www.inboxdollars.com/) worth it

**Suggestions**

When you complete offers it is very repetitive, but it is easy enough to just do them all.

1371139595.0,1g9wgr,"Introducing ""Tooyoou"" - Passively earn on your Android device!",messem10,68,18,65,"**What is it?**

The app is called “Tooyoou” and it is currently in open beta which uses some of your homescreen to send you ads. Here is a [link](http://tooyoou.com/howitworks) to the site where it explains how it works.

**How do I earn?**

You earn by installing the application and having a widget on your homescreen. In this widget

**What are some caveats?**

The main issue that I could find is that it could be a big data hog so I would suggest using it when you are on Wifi or on an actual unlimted plan. I

**How fast can you earn?**

Personally

•	Connectivity to data or wireless network has changed.

•	You have checked your account balance.

•	You have saved your preferences using “Your Choice”.

**What is this “Your Choice”?**

It is their way of having targeted ads pointed your way. What you do is state your general age

**How can you get paid?**

It appears that you can be paid once a month through Paypal. You must have a pending balance of $5.00 for it to send the money to your Paypal account. You can also download apps to earn “points” but I do not know the point to dollar ratio for you must have 2500 points to get a gift card. From the website where I found out about the application, cannot vouch for this amount of earning for I am quite new to it. I am mainly submitting it here so that other people can find out about it.

**Where can I find this application?**

You can find it on the Google Play Store under the title “Tooyoou” or at this [link.]( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tooyoou.android&amp;hl=en)

I wanted to share a site that I've been using for three years now. I did a search and nothing popped up so I don't think it's been mentioned here yet. 

It's a site strictly for students (university/college) called Notesolution where you upload notes online for credits. You can then use credits to redeem gift cards in increments of $10. In the past three years I've redeemed up to $50 in Amazon gift cards. 

You can upload documents in pdf or xdoc format and each upload is worth 25 credits for courses that have less than 50 documents uploaded already. You get 10 credits if there are already a lot of notes on that course. Depending on how popular this site is at your school you may get 25 or 10 credits per upload. So far

There are also plenty of achievements/badges that you can work towards (ex. 25 credits for your first 10 uploads) so for me, you get credits too. If they download lecture notes you receive 10 credits, textbook notes are worth 16 credits and exam notes are worth 24 credits. Once they download it they can rate your notes, so if you take great notes you may get more downloads and therefore more credits.

I take lots of notes in class anyway so getting a little extra money for it is great, Cineplex, Chapters and Best Buy if you don't use Amazon. Only downside is they process all the giftcards manually so it takes a week or so for you to receive the gift card, but for me it's okay I don't necessarily always need to use it right away. I never received one of my gift cards one time and I contacted their customer support, they responded within the hour and I got the gift card later that night.

Only thing you have to be careful of is you can't upload notes that are directly from the professor

Anyway

Happy studying!

A few notes: I am in the US so I can not speak to what countries all these work in

**Starting off first with mobile.**

Bamboo Wallet is an iOS and android app that has you do various things to earn rewards. It has surveys, it is very similar to some of the various websites, but is an app. Accompanying this app is m.junowallet.com that share login info and balance, the site has some different offers and the site is how you access trying apps. If you want to use my referral just enter TH1272839 after creating your account when it asks you for your invite code. Entering an invite code also earns you $0.25 at sign up. I can make about $10 in gift cards every week to week and half with little effort. 

[FreeMyApps](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/267a79c6) is an iOS app that has you try out apps for credits, so you can cash out often. Worth noting is that it uses your device serial number, not a login, so if you multiple devices you can run this multiple times and cash out 2 or 3 times more often if you have 2 or 3 devices, more if you have more. Income is dependent on how often they add new stuff. But it ranges from $5-$10 in amazon cards every week or so, sometimes less if they don't update, sometimes more if they have a stretch of frequent updates.  [Non-Ref](http://m.freemyapps.com)

[Viggle](http://join.viggle.com/thudia) is an iphone/android app that you watch ads and check into TV shows. Ads very in value and different shows have different bonuses. This site has had it's issues lately by decreasing payouts and earnings, but people who were used to it being better are a little disappointed. Average earnings is about $10 in gift cards every 2 weeks or so, depends on how much you watch TV, and if you do any of the activities such as trivia or the upcoming football myguy. 
Edit: they just confirmed no more referral points

apptrailers and m.appredeem.com these 2 share a points system and login
 Just playing with it when I have downtime I have made $15-$30/mo. 

**Websites**

[Superpoints](http://superpoints.com/refer/hudiaebay) is not my favorite but is ok. I pretty much just do the super button and my lucky emails, but don't really care to, not bad for just a minute or two a day though. 

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=6661696C65646A656469) pays for clicking ads. The unique thing here is that you can rent referrals. You can then monitor their performance and recycle them for new ones as needed. This site starts out extremely slow if you don't invest. But if you are willing to invest from the start and rent some referrals, invested $5, cashed out $6. Next month I made 12, cashed out $6, and reinvested $6 into recycling and extending referrals, third month I made $20, cashed out $10 and reinvested $10. So while the earnings are slower than most sites, and you can eventually be making ok beermoney. I usually do only enough to get referral credit for the next day. You have to be active to get credit for referrals

[Bing Rewards](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;amp;rrid=CAE0F591-2696-4D99-8BB3-C09C606F7011) This one is slower but easy. Just search bing and get points. Everyones points seem to be different and random as to what the daily cap is. But I spend 3 minutes every morning doing my daily max. Just search and keep hitting related. I usually get about $5 a month from own searches, but you won't get more by getting mass referrals. 

[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/hudiho) is another common one I am sure you most use. But get points, 2 from the no strings offers, and 3 from the video survey. I then do a few searches until I get points and I am done for the day. I don't do anything else, but sometimes try to get swag codes. This plus having just a handful of active referrals and I get between $35 and $50 a month in rewards, sometimes I get amazon, sometimes paypal. [Non-Ref](http://www.swagbucks.com)

[GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/invite/TH98425) is sort of like swagbucks and superpoints combined. Same deal as most sites, complete offers and get points. But like superpoints there is a treasure chest that rewards random points. The more active you are the more keys (tries) you have to get more random points. Right now I get about $5-$10/mo without doing much, but I am fairly new so I don't know how typical that is.  [Non-Ref](http://gifthulk.com) 

[Quirky](http://www.quirky.com/?r=04552d4bd936c36aaf2c263874361bce) is a site where you get involved in different parts of a products development. You vote on ideas you want to see make it further, you get a portion of the sale. At first the income is slow, but if you are active for a while you can get some decent profits. Income totally relates to active you are. You can expect not to see any income for a while as products take a while to become real. You start voting at the idea phase, and while you earn the right to income from the product, it might not exist and be for sale for a while. But just spend a few minutes of free time a week voting and taking surveys and eventually you will start getting income on those products when they finally go up for sale. [Non-Ref](http://www.quirky.com)

**Services**

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=CS6VL7ZJ9H45) is slow paying but 100% passive. You just sign up, and have a handful of very active referrals, and I am able to cash out $10, every 1.5 weeks to 2.5 weeks. So about $20/mo for doing nothing more than installing the plug in, and cashing out. [Non-ref](http://jointopline.com)



So that is what I do and roughly what I earn. I have not been using mturk most of the summer but since school started back up there seems to be enough posted hits that I will probably go back to it. I still do an occasional survey here and there

If there are any similar sites you think I should join feel free to post referrals in comments. I am always looking to find new sites/services as long as they are not too time consuming. I am also always looking for new apps I can use on the go to earn some beermoney. 

If you have any questions feel free to ask and I will try to answer them as best as I can.

I find myself waiting for this month's payday at Zujava and then it kind of clicked that I've never seen it discussed here and similar sites are also pretty rare. Ref link signups are very much appreciated :)

**My Experience With Zujava**
I've earned $30 with 2 months worth of paydays ([last month's proof](http://i.imgur.com/2wyFTm9.png)). I currently have 10 articles published which are simple reviews/opinions on video games currently.

While $1.50 is kind of below average compared to some of the other writing type sites that pay you up front I want to point out that I earn ~$1.50 per article PER MONTH. And since setting up my account and putting up 10 'test' type articles I haven't actually touched my account at all

I like the idea of growing some passive income rather than requiring constant effort to earn money (like Swagbucks). 

**So What is Zujava?**
Zujava is an online web 2.0 platform where you can publish articles much like Squidoo

You can publish articles on anything within reason (no R rated content

Creating articles is easy, picture, amazon product etc. You don't need to know how to do anything fancy (other than writing!)

**How Does It Work**
Zujava gives 50% of all ad revenue to its publishers and 50% of any Amazon sales (I've made 2 sales by just putting a related product on the page

Once you publish a page on Zujava its ranked against the other articles on the site and given a ZQ rank (based on traffic

Earnings are then paid on a net60 (was net30 when I started) basis (probably the biggest con of the site) but once you get your first payment you'll be rolling in the payments monthly. This is definitely a site for the long term.

**Why Zujava - Pros of Zujava**
-Unlike other sites you don't need an Adsense or Amazon account

-EVERY articles receives some ad revenue because of the % tiers rather than hard cut off values. I disliked Squidoo because you have to be within a certain number to get paid. This way no work is wasted

-Low $5 Cashout to PayPal.

-Friendly community always willing to help and provide feedback.

-Ease of use

-Nice referral program (20% of referral earnings

-Regular contests to boost earnings/exposure

**Tips/Tricks**
-Always include at least one Amazon module

-Make sure you are writing good quality stuff (especially your first 3 pages). Your first 3 pages are hand reviewed to ensure your meeting site standards (quite easy) before you graduate out of the newbie club called the Petting Zu.

-Spend sometime learning some basic SEO (I'm just starting to do this now). Things like how to find good article ideas based on what people are looking for

-Always try get some high quality pictures/YouTube videos in there

1357094403.0,15sx7i,International beer money sites: a few starting points (and places to avoid),fromsilentsky,47,3,24,"Happy new year!

A number of you have been asking for recommendations on good websites that welcome international users.  Frustrating how so many places seem to be geared towards Americans

I also figured that, but it does not mention any age or geographic restrictions each of those sites have, so deciding where to start can be overwhelming.

### Some things to keep in mind (especially if you’re entirely new to all of this)

* Create a dedicated email account for your GPT activities because you will receive **a lot** of messages.  You may also need to have several throwaway addresses to complete various offers (which involve signing up for things that will give you tons of spam).  Having a P.O. box and/or Google Voice number is a plus

* Don’t register on too many sites at once or you’ll feel overwhelmed.  Start off with one or two places

* Trial and error is the only way you can figure out how to establish a solid money-making routine for yourself

* Although plenty of scams are out there, and see what happens.  Only then can you determine if the site is worth your time and effort.

* Write down your referral URLs on a card and keep it handy in your wallet

* Many GPT and PTC websites have strict policies limiting registrations to one account per computer / internet connection / household.  If you are going to refer your relatives or offline friends

* Adding to the above, and don’t let your friend/relative use *their* account on *your* computer.  This can cause the both of you to be banned for multiple account usage.

* Using proxies / VPN is an easy way to get banned from many GPT and PTC websites.

* Don’t access your account on shared/public internet connections unless you’re sure no one has ever logged on to those sites and that your IP address is not known to be part of a VPN.  Use this [advanced proxy check](http://www.whatismyipaddress.com/proxy-check/) to confirm the latter.  Otherwise

* Constant disqualification on surveys is normal and happens to everyone.  Don’t give up on them so easily!  Common reasons a survey suddenly terminates halfway through include: failing attention/human checks, taking a break halfway through (rarely but can happen), quota already met while you were still answering questions.  Some people here have said you’re better off answering surveys on Amazon Mechanical Turk because you almost never get screened out; however, there are requesters who post surveys that disqualify certain participants or outright reject all submissions to get free data (both of which will get them nasty [turkopticon](http://turkopticon.differenceengines.com/) reviews anyway).  Everything I know about taking paid surveys, I learned from Darkstar2 on ClixSense, a Canadian guy who has been at this for years and used to work in market research.

Please let me know if I have made any mistakes with age / location / payment requirements as listed below.  Unless otherwise stated

* **ClixSense**, surveys, and tasks.  It also has a ClixGrid game, where you click on a square up to 25 times/day (50 for premium), view an ad for 10 seconds (5 for premium), and hope (if you’re lucky!) to win a few cents.  I joined on December 1st and made a little over $20 in my first month.  I earned $5 on my first week, reached $8 by week 2, although it’s a bit Canadian-centric and some of the things mentioned (like casino search tasks and paid-to-call offers) may not be available to everyone.

* Another PTC/GPT hybrid, and Flash is not required for the purpose of validating clicks.  Points can only be used to purchase advertisements on the site; they cannot be converted to cash, unlike on its sister sites.

* **PollBuzzer** pays $1 for each question answered.  All you have to do is click on the answer in your email.  It’s that simple!  Even though PB has not sent me a single question

### Not recommended

* **Amazon Mechanical Turk:** Your application will be rejected if you select any country other than United States, try CloudCrowd (see link above), [Clickworker](http://www.clickworker.com/), [Elance](http://www.elance.com/), [oDesk](http://www.odesk.com/), or [Freelancer](http://www.freelancer.com/).  Although I have not used any of those alternatives, I am sure someone here can vouch for them.

* **InboxDollars:** Only U.S. residents will receive PaidEmails and have offers to do

* **Topline:** Self-explanatory if you’ve been keeping up with /r/beermoney over the last two months.  I actually do like passive methods; too bad they don’t work in practice.  No alternatives to recommend.

* **[PaidViewpoint](http://www.paidviewpoint.com/?r=fromsilentsky):** ^[non-ref](http://www.paidviewpoint.com/) The fact that it pays international users 7¢ less than its American counterparts for each trait survey makes it not worth recommending.  Not to mention the $15 minimum, and Pinecone isn’t accepting new registrations, so again, no other alternatives to recommend.  (Other than maybe PollBuzzer.  Also threw in referral link in case anyone wants to try PaidViewpoint for fun.)

* **[FusionCash](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=fromsilentsky):** ^[non-ref](http://www.fusioncash.net/) U.S. 13+ and Canada 18+ only.  Great site for Americans, and do not get any paid emails or PTC ads.  Also, earnings from successfully credited offers expire 180 days (6 months) after they are first posted to your account, so cashing out as soon as possible is highly recommended.  ClixSense is a much better alternative.

* **LikeCash:** Joined after seeing it mentioned here a few months ago but found it to be a dud.  It rarely

First off an Amazon Gift Certificate for $25 for doing a short email based or chat interview. I received my gift certificate the other day and it's all legit. Go here http://www.ucalgary.ca/selfhelp/ do the survey and they'll send you the information for the interview. It took me a while

Second is $50 free from ING direct for opening up an account. This is the easiest of the two and takes the least amount of time literally 3 minutes. Just go to the website www.ingdirect.ca click ""Sign Me Up"" then ISA account. Give them your information including the Orange Key 39021172S1

It's a promotion until the end of December. Just remember to use the Orange Key 39021172S1 and that the minimum deposit is $100 to get the promotion. There are also no restriction

You see, books and, of course, beer. I devoted a good time to several sites, to the point where I became absorbed in collecting as much points or virtual dollars as possible.

I had daily routines, and watching those stupid SwagbucksTV videos (""How many vietnam vets does it take to screw in a lightbulb?"" Shut up!)

I made pretty good money from all these sites

A swagbucks video credits 10% of 3 bucks every minute. For many beermoney novices, I had to watch 1500 videos to earn a $5 Amazon gift card.

That's 25 hours of non-stop videos for 5 non-liquid bucks. Sure

Since graduating college, those still exist) and kind of a social life. So i made it an effort to focus only on **EASY, PASSIVE and QUICK beermoney options.**

1336702402.0,thj1f,"The most comprehensive and detailed SuperPoints guide on the Internet. Guides, advice and proof included. *LONG*",g000dn,63,17,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/thj1f/the_most_comprehensive_and_detailed_superpoints/

[Screenshot of my earnings.](http://i.imgur.com/KOHtY.png) 

I have decided to post this because I constantly see people mention Superpoints with disdain or with little good to say about the site. It always seems to boil down to an inability to gather referrals, e-mails and the SuperLucky button itself. But I am here to prove that those things have little to do with the *ideal* earning potential that Superpoints offers.

First, as the user- not in the SuperLucky button, not in referrals, not in paid e-mails and bonus referral links. The greatest earning potential lies in Offers, knowing which offers to complete, which offers to avoid like the plague, and which offers can be trusted.

In this guide, as I call them, and which offers should be avoided, completed, and how to complete offers without ever worrying about acquiring unwanted charges to your credit card- Yes, your credit card, because in order to really milk Superpoints for all its worth

If you viewed my earnings screenshot, there were certain steps I took that **insured** I would not accidentally be charged, or that I wouldn't accidentally forget to cancel a free trial. I will list those steps now-

If I signed up to Netflix through Superpoints today

* Get a piece of paper that you can store in an easily accessible location
* Write down your Netflix account info and password
* Write down the date you signed up to Netflix
* Write down the date the Netflix trial ends
* Write down the phone number or website address needed to cancel the trial (www.netflix.com/cancel) for example

With that *all* of that information on an easily accessible piece of paper that you can see daily thus constantly be reminded

The free-trial period varies greatly between the various offers. Some are 5 days, and some last a month. The key is knowing exactly when each offer will charge your credit card, and cancelling two or three days before then.

----

**The following is the most comprehensive Offers guide that has ever been on beermoney. If you follow this guide to the letter

----

I mentioned ""offer vendors"" earlier in this post. I will post a screenshot of what I mean by that.

[These](http://i.imgur.com/PDN6q.png?1) are the Offer Vendors. They can be found when you click **Get Points** and select **Complete Offers**. When you access that page, and most of them are very lucrative free trials or service/products that you may be interested in.

Here I will list my choices for TrialPay's most lucrative offers. At the end of my post I will add up all the points of the TrialPay offers to show you how much money you stand to earn if you were to complete all of the offers I list.

**Netflix**!! - For 800 points

**Stamps.com** - 700 points - Stamps.com is a wonderful offer as well

**BigFish Games** - 700 points - This is a lucrative offer, **New299**. Be sure not to sign up for their recurring membership. *Nothing needs to be cancelled if you do not sign up to their monthly service.*

**Gamefly** - **1000** points - A great service for gamers! For $5.95 a month, they have a wide selection of video games that you can choose to have mailed to you and play them to your hearts content for a month. *Cancel on their website before your first month so you won't be charged for two months.*

**FreeCreditScore.com** - 900 points - 7-day trial membership. Your typical credit checking service. **Be very careful where you click**

**PushPlay** - 350 points - Free trial. Media streaming service. 5-day free trial. *Be sure to note the trial length and how to cancel the trial*

**RealPlayer Superpass** - 500 points - Free 14-day trial. *Call 1-866-212-1343 to cancel*

**AudioBooks.com** - 700 points - Free trial

**VistaPrint** - 500 points - Get 250 free business cards that you can print *anything you want on*, this is no trial. I believe S+H was $2 or $3. *I don't believe there is anything to cancel, be sure to check their site, though.*

**Rhapsody** - 250 points - Music service that is pointless with the creation of Spotify. 14-day trial. *Cancel on their website or by calling. I would suggest calling.*

**Lumosity**! - 200 points - A 14-day trial to a very fun website that has all kinds of brain exercise games and puzzles. I thoroughly enjoyed using their site for 2 weeks. *Cancel online

**Activate a FREE Mint.com Account** - 100 points - I believe this is budgeting software. They are legit and can be trusted

----

I have personally completed every offer I just listed above, there is no reason that you'll be charged more than $10 or so dollars to complete those offers.


Instead of offering details for individual offers for other Offer Vendors

* Hunt for Offers that pay less than 10 Superpoints. They usually only require an e-mail address or they are a video. I would suggest an extra e-mail address

* Avoid Offers that say ""Play _____ for Free!"" they are typically full of mal-ware and spy-ware. They can usually be found on the pages of the Offer Vendor

* Hunt for Offers that request you to install a Facebook app. They always pay out and when you authorize the Facebook app on your Facebook account

* RadiumOne is a pretty good Offer Vendor. They offer many of the same sffers as TrialPay, DealChicken, Google Offers, SavingStar are very simple, low paying offers that are worth doing. *Also, if you see the **eMusic** offer available on RadiumOne, sign up for their 7-day free trial for 140 points. Note when and how to cancel.*

* Don't waste your time on surveys. They are not worth the time at all. If you want to do surveys

I've been actually making around $100 a month on Clixsense, so that's more than $100 a month. Here are the steps you should take:



Complete the **Daily Checklist bonus**. The *minimum* you have to do is: 

1. 2 ads a day (6-50 seconds)

2. 15 clicks on ClixGrid (150 seconds)

3. Visit a page on the forum (1 second)

4. 10 Tasks OR 2 Offers (Or a combination of 1 Offer and 5 Tasks)

I don't really bother with clicking on ads because it gets you a tiny amount of money (mostly less than a cent per ad)

I don't really do any Tasks either, because other's mostly don't work (daily surveys give you $0.7-$1.5).

Do all that

You can check your Daily Checklist status on your account page.

**Payouts**

Payouts are done twice a week

**Upgrading to Premium**

When you have something that you don't need anymore, sometimes you post them on Craigslist. But there's no system based on merit or need. Listia intends to become the epicenter for giving away free things. By doing things like signing up, giving away free items, and more, users can build up credits and bid on free items. When you join Listia, you get 500 credits. You earn more credits every time you list an item and other users bid on it. Then you can use your credits to buy cool things other people are giving away. The highest bidder wins, so each item goes to the person who wants it most! Getting more credits is easy, costs nothing!

**Here's how it works:**

* You sign up and are automatically given 500 credits.
* You can use those credits to bid on free items - everything from iPods to magnets to books to recipes.
* At the end date

I have personally been using this site for nearly a year now, PC games, headphones, a jacket, a hat, and much more! I have virtually lost nothing, because I have just given away things that have no value to me anymore. 

My past point: Referrals are not essential, then... whatever. Also, if you use the referral, you will get a bonus 100 credits, as well as 500 bonus credits when you complete your first listing!

Hey everyone

Been tracking a lot of Locket posts and I know it shows up quite a few times here. Sometimes a little too much

Because of this, if we have 50 ads running. You could get 50 cents per day. 100 ads running... a dollar per day. However, say you see an ad for Sharpie today. Then the same exact ad tomorrow... you'll still get paid once for today and once for tomorrow. 

We've gotten a number of complaints saying we sometimes show ads but not pay. And with this system you'll at least get paid once for each ad. 

Now, get creatives, get approval etc. 

Once we get advertisers we're hoping people will get more than a dollar per day. We don't think we'll put more than 150 ads on the lock screen (average times we look at lock screens without Locket app is 150 times). But it's a lot more than the .30 average people have been getting. Will take time so I don't blame you guys for signing out/uninstalling and then picking it up a few months down the road. 

I know how you guys enjoy calculating earnings. Sorry that it'll be off. First year? Hmm perhaps about the same or a tiny bit more than calculated earnings from before. Second year

Also, better than iBotta's first few months. They completely stopped all cash outs for a period of time. We're doing this first, cause of fraud. Second, because we don't get paid from our advertisers until after a month or so after an ad runs. Calculate our seed funding with the number of users we have... yeah...

You have until tonight (August 15) to cash out your $10. Close? We put in Aarki so you can earn a few extra dollars and cash out today. Otherwise

Oh also referral bonuses are gone by the end of tonight. Gonna bring it back though.

**tl;dr 3 cent cap removed. Now you'll get paid for every new ad you see of the day. Cash out raise to $20. Payments now all paid on a day of the month. Offer wall added to earn a bit extra.**

So you start out and you don't really have anything. You're a basic user. A Member. You get the credits for searching and the credits for the daily clicks (found by clicking your ribbon in the upper right and cycling through) However

Make sure you keep your searches consistent. Why? So you can upgrade to a Silver account. To do this, and set a reward as your goal (don't have to earn it, though with 200 credits, you probably will earn it if it's MS Points). This nets you 50 bonus credits and the ability to do a few more credits' searching per day and ups your referrals to 5 friends for five each.

Then, not on you, just like the 200), and do 150 searches per month (20 per day will count so you need to show up for 7 1/2 days out of the month and hit the max). This nets you 5% discount on MS points and gold subs, 10% discount on everything else, and you can now earn 30 credits per day for searching and your referrals are upped to 10 credits per friend, 10 friends. Now you can get 100 MS points in roughly 4 days as opposed to the week-ish from before, but most just use it for the points).

&gt;
&gt;Dear InfoArmy Researcher
&gt;
&gt;InfoArmy launched last June. Since that time we have worked together trying to create an innovative new business model that would allow many researchers to eventually earn income on the InfoArmy platform. Unfortunately
&gt;
&gt;    Sales are not happening. So far InfoArmy has sold just 44 individual report subscriptions ($4
&gt;    Almost two months ago we hired a full time sales person. He has been unsuccessful so far. Data quality is the main issue preventing sales. Common complaints include incorrect revenue estimates and competitors.
&gt;    Publication bonuses have created the wrong incentives. Some researchers have published the lowest quality reports they can get away with.
&gt;    Quarterly updates are very unpopular - even with our best researchers. The report abandonment rate for quarterly updates is high. Updates are critical to the success of the current model. We have been unable to create a sense of report ownership across a large enough group of researchers.
&gt;    So far InfoArmy has paid $146K to researchers (averaging $23/report), without a clear path to revenue this model is unsustainable.
&gt;
&gt;InfoArmy takes full responsibility for the above issues. This business model was our idea. Unfortunately it isn't working as planned and we have to make some major changes.
&gt;
&gt;We haven't figured it all out yet
&gt;
&gt;    No more 50/50 Revenue Share. Members will exchange information they have for information they need.
&gt;    No more report ownership. Many different people will contribute to reports and make estimates. Reports will be updated in real time instead of quarterly.
&gt;    All reports will be free (in their current form). The object will be to create added value that can eventually be put behind a pay wall.
&gt;
&gt;For purposes of clarity
&gt;
&gt;We made one final General Fund Payment on January 31st
&gt;
&gt;We anticipate that you may have questions and concerns. Please email us at support@infoarmy.com and we will respond as quickly as possible. We will also have two webinars to answer your questions. They will occur on Friday
&gt;
&gt;To the majority of researchers who believed in the InfoArmy vision of creating a revenue share platform we offer our sincere apologies that the current model did not work. We recognize that many of you poured your hearts into creating reports
&gt;
&gt;With best regards

**Superpoints**

In March, so it didn't grow. Also, the payment screenshot doesn't include the 30th and 31st, so if it comes out to $70 or $75, that's why. I expect next month to be about the same. This isn't typical for the site though. I have a lot of referrals.

I haven't used it much this month since there were occasional captchas, but I still got **$20** in Amazon gift cards.. 

It's another site that pays redeemable points for people who complete offers, and take surveys. 

The big earner on Swagbucks is the video option. If you have a smartphone, though many people are still managing to do it by using auto-refreshers that stop on the 10th video so they can type in a captcha if needed.

Searching is great too. After a few tries

I've started writing articles on Hubpages. It's a nice option for people that like to write guides, poetry, and whatever else. Obviously, you could always do a blog with ads as well, which would have a bit more potential, but Hubpages is a little easier make something that looks nice in my opinion and it's a little easier to promote.

So far I've only made $3.85 with 3 articles(mostly just from one of them that had a wider appeal), and Facebook. After a couple months pass, I'll promote something I've already promoted in the past for a new surge of readers and more money. 

If you don't want to write

You can also refer new writers and get a matched amount for 10% of their lifetime earnings. Considering some people really go nuts with it and actually make hundreds each month

When I first started browsing r/beermoney a few months ago I was a little bit overwhelmed by the sheer variety of sites/apps you could use for making extra cash. As most new people do

I narrowed it down to just three services

The services I use are:

**Name: [Amazon Mechanical Turk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)**

- *Typical Monthly Payout:* $80-120

- *How it works:* ""Amazon Mechanical Turk is a marketplace for work that requires human intelligence."" Basically you'll be filling out surveys, writing and doing other somewhat monotonous tasks. These are called HITS, and each HIT is worth a certain dollar amount.  

- *Why I use it:* No surprise here

- *My routine:* I typically turk for about 15-30 minutes in the morning before getting ready for the day

**Name: [FeaturePoints](http://featu.re/K513TX)** - [no ref](http://featurepoints.com/web/)

- *Typical Monthly Payout:* $20-30

- *How it works:* Download free apps on your phone/tablet (both ios &amp; android) and earn points that can be redeemed for all kinds of rewards (gift cards, etc). Minimum Paypal cashout is $5

- *Why I use it:* It provides a way of making beermoney on the go with very few hassles. Just download the apps and try them out for a minute

- *My routine:* I typically check out and download the new apps available every morning and then check it a few times during the day (pretty much every time I go to the restroom haha) to see if there are new offers available. Very simple and hassle free.

**Name: [PollBuzzer](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=b3Z6V0l2QzZHRkMwVm1zR2xJS3dwZz090)** - [no ref](http://pollbuzzer.com)

- *Typical monthly payout:* $20-30

- *How it works:* You get one-question surveys delivered to your email address whenever they're available (based on your demographic). Simply click on your answer

- *Why I use it:* No sites to visit, usually the PollBuzzer emails aren't nearly that common..but sometimes you get lucky. 

- *My routine:* Just open the emails and answer the question whenever they show up in my inbox. Simple stuff.

And that's pretty much my entire routine. I don't make a ton

1307383775.0,ht0v7,Bitcoining: a simple guide to get you started,okiyama,44,7,36,"**Continuum pool is recommended over deepbit

https://deepbit.net/

Sign up for an account. Choose proportional mode.

Download [this](http://forum.bitcoin.org/?topic=2444.0) and [this](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Tweak/Video-Tweak/GUIMiner.shtml) and [this](http://www.bitcoin.org/).

First one you just extract. Second one is your mining program. Third one is your wallet where you keep track of all your bitcoins.

So you have a deepbit account

Now go back to [your account](https://deepbit.net/account) and click create worker. Set the worker's login tail to 0 and the password to anything you will remember. Leave payout as proportional and click save settings.

Open up GuiMiner. File&gt;new other miner and navigate to where you extracted that third link(the one with 4 .exes). Select rpcminer-cuda.exe for your new other miner. Name it CUDA. In the guiminer tab for this new miner(the CUDA tab) set the server to other. 

Host: pit.deepbit.net 

Port: 8332 

Username: youremail@email.com**_0**  *you must add the _0*

Password: The password of your created worker 

Extra flags: Only needed for more than 1 graphics card

Go into guiminer and do file &gt; save settings. Now click start mining. The number of MHash/s is completely dependent on your graphics card's power. I have 2 cards that get about 30 MH/s each. To check your mined coins go [here](https://deepbit.net/account).

Okay, you now have bitcoins to spend. To spend them you just get the address of the person who you are sending them to then click the send button on bitcoin.exe, put in their address and the amount.

Also

**Part 2

I have 2 graphics cards so setup took a bit more for me

Only a few things you need to do. Go to your [deepbit account](https://deepbit.net/account) and click ""create new worker"". For worker login tail set it to 1. Set the password to something you will remember. Leave payment proportional. Save settings. Now go to your guiminer. In your original CUDA tab with your username as youremail@email.com_0 go into the extra flags and put in ""-gpu=0"". Now go to file&gt;new other worker and choose the rpcminer-cuda.exe as before. Name it CUDA2. In the CUDA2 tab have the following settings.

Server: other

Host: pit.deepbit.net

Port: 8332

Username: youremail@email.com**_1** *must have the _1*

Password: The password you set when you made the new worker on deepbit.

Extra flags: -gpu=1

So you end up with 2 tabs

File&gt;save settings in guiminer and click start mining on both tabs.

A final piece of advice. This will use your GPU heavily

Second

This app is pretty simple. Scan your receipt from your grocery purchase, you get extra money. Personally, I love this app and I've made about $20 so far within two months. They have major brands on here so it isn't anything crazy. For example, offers that I have redeemed include Driscoll raspberries, Tylenol, and Coppertone sunscreen.

Thanks u/punchthekeys for the input! Savingstar is a great way to earn a couple dollars back at checkout.

(US),stillpuzzledbylife,48,10,77,"A coworker showed me Yardsellr a few months back and I haven't stopped playing with it since. People refer to it as Ebay for Facebook. You gain photons (Ydsr points) in Yardsellr by blockifying (categorizing) new items that sellers list. Each 1000 points equal .01. Every 6-10 items categorized gets you nearly 0.25. The cap is $10 a day which isn't that difficult to do if you categorize the right time of day. You can use these points to buy anything on the site. My coworker used to buy silver coins with it. I found that people sell gift cards as well. A $50 walmart/ shell gas/ amazon gift card is usually 60 dollars worth of photons. Also if you join

Edit: It is connected to facebook. You have to have a facebook account ( or fake account.) Sellers also have to have an account. So facebook friends who are on yardseller get the referral bonus. Also if you are worried if a seller is legit or giving you bogus gift cards

Edit2:If the counter is going down you will loose your photons!! Make sure you drag over the counter and ""Pause"" it!! You have to pause it every day or you will loose the hard earned photons you are trying to earn.  If you follow a block it will be added to the list of stuff you can blockify. When you blockify there should also be a search bar on the bottom of the little window after you click the plus sign. Protip: Follow the block ""Household"" Most of the odd things go in there. Also watches are considered jewelry. So if you see a watch you can blockify under watches and jewelry. You can put it under more then one block.",,t5_2s5or,1354226151.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13yw9u/time_to_expose_my_secret_money_making_ways_i/

**Paid To Click**

[NatureBucks](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?refid=30059) | [Non Ref](http://naturebucks.com) - This site offers a variety of tasks such as watching videos


[NatureGPT](http://naturegpt.com/members/register.php?refid=3098) | [Non Ref](http://naturegpt.com/) - It's pretty much the same as NatureBucks but the referral system is slightly different. You will earn 10% of what your direct referrals earn from offers.
You will also receive a $1.00 bonus when a referral completes an offer
worth at least $0.25 or 25 points. The minimum cash out is 2.00$ via paypal and amazon gift certificates.


**Crowdsourcing**


[MobileWorks](https://www.mobileworks.com/mobileworker/) - This platform offers various tasks and once you completed them


[CloudCrowd](https://www.cloudcrowd.com/i/kbsdkz) | [Non Ref](http://www.cloudcrowd.com/) - This is by far my favorite beermoney source of income. It's a platform that has work divided in categories like writing, research and a few more. First, you've got to qualify to jobs by getting credentials like English Comprehension, General Writing, Marketing Writing, etc. Then, once you start completing tasks, your credibility number will rise. This means that you'll have access to better paying tasks. There is no minimum withdrawal since you are payed for every task via paypal. The only bad thing about CloudCrowd is that you need to have a facebook account. It is mandatory. But it is totally worth it.


I'd really like to know of some other alternatives. Keep'em coming!

I was just notified about an Arby's Facebook giveaway, and in 5 minutes I was half way (points-wise) to a $10 Amazon Gift Card. Absolutely simple.

All you have to do is Like the contest page, tweet (optional) about the give away, and share stuff on facebook (also optional)

Other way to earn points to get the gift card include checking in via the iPhone app, you can check in as long as you're within a few miles of an Arby's) you can tweet daily about the contest, take a picture of a sandwich from Arby's on the iPhone app, Instagram, etc. It is ridiculously simple, especially if you don't care about looking like a consumer whore on your facebook. The promotion lasts until 5/31, which is MORE than enough time to earn a gift-card.

If you do have a problem with that

**It should also be noted**, so while the Amazon gift-card is a sure bet, the $10,000 would be totally kickass.

Here is a referral link (another way to earn points) **DO NOT** be alarmed about the page you see when you click my referral link. You are directed to that facebook page because you're allowing Arby's to see your *basic* facebook information

Tellwut pays you for completing surveys based on your opinion. Each survey is 1-5 multiple choice questions and takes about 10 seconds to answer.

For each survey you complete you get either 5 or 10 points. Points can be redeemed for gift cards (4000 points=$10 amazon gift card).

**Day 1:**

Sign up (100 points) and then fill our your profile (another 100 points). Next

**Daily Work:**

I usually visit Tellwut once a day and do all the new surveys (around 20 every day). Click on most recent and sort by ""time:newly listed"". Answer all the new surveys. (about 5 minutes of work)

After about 6-7 days you should have enough points for a $10 Amazon gift card. (Unfortunately no paypal option at this time)

[Swagbucks]( http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker) is my most consistent earner

**Daily Poll** - Each day has a daily poll

**NOSO** - No Obligation Special Offers are available every day

**Search** - It is possible to win up to 4 times a day from searching

**Swagbucks TV** - This is my largest source of Swagbucks

**Referrals** - When a referral wins from searching

**Daily Goal** - If you reach the daily goal, and if you make 7 or more days in a row you will get another bonus for that as well.

When you redeem a gift card, I easily earn five $5 Amazon Gift Cards a month. If you are interested you can sign up under [my referral link here](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker), or a [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com).

----

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) is a great passive way to earn money. It is an internet add-on that replaces advertisements with its own, with no referrals it took me 2 months to reach $10 and cash out. [Here is my referral link](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) to sign up, or a [non-ref]( https://www.jointopline.com).

----

[Naturebucks](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker) pays you to do very simple tasks like sign up for an email newsletter, and pay anywhere from $0.05 to $1.00. The things I like most about Naturebucks are bolded below.

**Minimum payout of 0.05** to Paypal

**Prompt payment** – Payout is instant for Paypal

**Five tiers of referrals** – Naturebucks gives you 20% of what your referrals make

**Bonus** – If you manage to get to $20.00 (this includes what you get from referrals), you can cash out as you go and once you hit 20.00 for your account’s lifetime you get the bonus. You can get the bonus multiple times, at each increment of twenty, so 20, 40, 60 and so on.

I have the best luck with offers that are under the Most Credited or Recently Credited columns

----

[Gifthulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/fire741cracker) is a great site that pays out to Paypal and Amazon gift cards. The $5 Amazon GC’s are the cheapest

**Daily Poll** - Each day there will be a new daily poll. You earn 1 Hulk Coin for each daily poll.

**Search** - I win about 2-3 times every day by searching. Prizes vary between hulk coins, permanent keys and store discounts.

**Treasure Box** - Each day you start off with 5 Daily Keys + however many “Permanent Keys” you have. Each key lets you open the Treasure Box, permanent keys, Fountain of Youth codes (like swag codes), boosts and even Amazon gift cards. This is like spinning the Superlucky Button on Superpoints.

**Fountain of Youth** – Enter codes to get free Hulk Coins. FOY codes are released on Gifthulk’s Facebook

**Referrals** – Each referral that earns 50 Hulk Coins gives you 1 permanent key to the treasure box. You also win 20% of your referrals Hulk Coins from searching, EZ coins, tasks and surveys. There is no limit on how much you can earn from your referrals.

**Offer Wall** – This has offers that do not cost anything, doing surveys, or signing up for an email newsletter. It also awards you for signing up for free trials, though you will have to cancel them before the trial period is over.

1349015568.0,10plol,I have a great way to earn some beer money - by Beta Testing websites.,betapunch,54,19,36,"Hi r/beermoney

My name is Ross and I started a website called [BetaPunch](http://betapunch.com). The purpose of my website is to help startup websites get feedback for their sites design

I have set up a way for these startup websites to get screen recorded user feedback from people like you

**There is NO download or installation or sign up required for you to test a website.** It's all web based one-click recording. You only need to make sure you have java enabled in your browser to launch the recorder.

**I offer $5 per 10 minute recorded screen cast of feedback (paid via pay pal).** Basically you just have to click record

So far

If you are interested in doing this - please PM me and I will send you the details as far as what site I would like you to test. Please be ready to start right away if you PM me.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks

-Ross

P.S. - Please don't test any websites on your own yet until I give you further instructions in PM if you are indeed interested in testing websites on BetaPunch.

**EDIT: This has been a very huge success. Thanks to all those who have tested websites today. There is only 1 more opportunity to test today. But don't worry

**The testing session is now ENDED for today. I will definitely be back to let you know when more tests become available!**",,t5_2s5or,1349051778.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/10plol/i_have_a_great_way_to_earn_some_beer_money_by/
1347995983.0,103e8f,Fusioncash - ~$30 my first month with minimal effort of &lt; 4 min/day.,turkmagurk,48,15,13,"So [Fusioncash](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=turkmagurk) has moved up in my depth chart of beermoney sites.  I joined the site a month ago and have it in my rotation now with minimal effort each day. After a month of ~4 min/day: [Imgur Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/D1KG0).  They pay out through direct deposit, hopefully you're in it for the long haul.

There are a multitude of ways to earn cash on this site

- Paid emails.  $0.02/day

- Cheap flights search. $0.10/day

- PTC. $0.15/day; credits instantly: Again, there isn't a 24 hour clock on it (so if you wanted to complete it once @ 11:50 PM, you could also do it at 12:01 AM).  Click on four of their pages, then click on two external links (one for their coupon site, another for a sponsored ad).  The icon looks [like this.](http://i.imgur.com/7LEyn)

- Videos. $0.01-$0.10/day: This one varies according to how many videos they have available

So that's what I do each day.  It takes a couple of minutes, etc.).  There's no forms to fill out or having to pay attention, and it's an easy $0.28-$0.40/day.

To get started

- Verify your email.  They don't spam your inbox (like a couple of other sites)

- Fill out the profile surveys on the Fusioncash site.  They'll give you $0.50 for doing so

[It should be worth noting a couple of things about Fusioncash's external Paid surveys they link to.  I don't usually do them because they take up time and you have the potential for being DQ'ed if you don't meet their criteria, they'll still give you $0.01 for trying them out.  If there's a survey that I know I have success with, I'll do it, notably the ""Vote for your favorite"" and some of the beverage surveys.  Otherwise, sometimes they're a time-sink.]

- Sign up for the Blockbuster offer.  It's a free $7.  It credits within 10 minutes and if you use the promotional code 'video', returned it the next day, and then cancelled it without any issues.

- Get your $5 signup bonus.  It can be found either buried in the Instant Credit offers or an alternate way to find it is if you click on the ""Support"" tab at the top and click on the corresponding link: ""Looking for your $5 signup bonus?""

- Verify your telephone number.  It's easy and they won't spam/sell your number- it's just a method of discouraging fraud and ensuring that you're not signing up for multiple accounts.

There are also a ton of other ways to make money on the site (searches: 0.05/day, etc.), but I just wanted to highlight what I do each day.  

Their [referral system](http://www.fusioncash.net/?ref=turkmagurk) is fantastic.  You get $1.00 for each confirmed referral, but I could see how this is a nice bonus if you have active people.

A couple of notes if you've gotten this far:

- US only.  :(

- Minimum cashout of $25

- Cashout has a lag period.  If you request a cashout by the end of the month

- Obligatory [non-ref link.](http://fusioncash.net) :(

**Please** let me know if you have any questions and I'll try to do my best to respond.  I know I said I'd try to be brief

**Swagbucks**

I've recently began getting captchas every 10^th video and haven't used it as much lately

It's another site that pays redeemable points for people who complete offers, and take surveys. 

The big earner on Swagbucks is the video option. If you have a smartphone, though many people are still managing to do it by using auto-refreshers that stop on the 10th video so they can type in a captcha if needed.

Searching is great too. After a few tries

Basically an auction site with on site currency instead of real money. You get 500 points or so when you sign up and I've been making more by selling coke rewards codes for another 100 each. Last month I was able to save up about 1200 pts and buy **Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2** for the PS2.

**FREE AWESOME**

It's owned by the same company as Swagbucks

The site has a slot machine that can add anywhere from 50 cents to $25 to your account and has a possible jackpot that increases over time(currently about $1200). It seems that just about everyone gets around two or three dollars on the 5 free spins you start with. You get 2 free spins occasionally in an email and can get more by doing surveys and offers. You also get 5 spins for every person you refer to the site. 
The most I've ever received on a spin was $1 and am currently at **$7.50**. The minimum payout is $10. Hopefully I'll cash out my $10 this month and earn a bit more.

They've also added poker

They also have an hourly lottery you can enter. The lotteries range from 3 numbers, ranging from 1 to 39, for $500,000. The odds are rather low and considering it's the same company as Swagbucks, they can probably afford to payout when someone wins no problem. Chances are you won't win anything, but for those that like playing the lottery, at least you don't have to pay to play this one. You can be entered into every hourly lottery automatically for days, or even months by completing offers.

Do any of you know of reliable methods to earn money full-time online (I CAN work 30+ hours/week, though if I don't pull down at LEAST $150 in the first week, I'll probably have to find SOME sort of part time job, and then eat nothing but ramen until i can get things working right for me.

I found a thread on BHW about publishing eBooks. You can create eBooks with absolutely no knowledge except for the content you write at: 

https://kdp.amazon.com

Sure it takes real effort to write something

So let's get together and help each other create some great eBooks! I know I can help with design aspects of eBooks if you want to make yours look really good.

If you sell your eBooks exclusively on Amazon you can sell your book under KDP Select where they actually promote your book for you if it's profitable enough.

I think it would be great to even create collection of stuff from users here be it short stories or other random things (sky is the limit). I'd be willing to put it all together and we can all split the profits depending on how much work you put in.

1356145998.0,159he0,iphone Apps,otterberg1,36,3,16,"Since discovering Beermoney I’ve been using a lot of Apps on my Iphone to rack up gift cards.  Some I’ve heard mentioned here and some I haven’t.  So I figured I’d share some of what I’ve learned and give back to the Reddit community that has helped me purchase frivolous shit on Amazon.  

I know we’re supposed to do the Ref/non Ref link thing but these are Apps so you just go to the app store and download them so I don’t know how that would work.  There’s probably a way but I don’t know it.  Actually I don’t even know how to make those cute blue link things for regular websites so it doesn’t matter anyway.  I’ll put my refs at the bottom if you want to use them.  If you are offended by my reddiquette transgression

Swagbuck TV App-   If you aren’t already using swagbucks then this must be the first beermoney link you’ve ever clicked on.  Close this tab and open the link above and below it.  Someone else will tell you about it.  if you do use swagbucks you should really be using the app.  It’s free swagbucks for doing nothing.

  Be warned!-  I don’t have unlimited data on my phone plan and even when I use the wi-fi at my house it will switch to 3g after I’ve been streaming a while (insert greedy corporate conspiracy theory)  I fucked up and went over my limit and got hit with a charge because of this.  If you have data limits turn off your 3g in the settings options before running this app. 
 
Free App Win-   This App is daily drawings to win gift cards.  They have sponsored apps that pay the prizes.  You are invited to download more apps for more chances to win.  I’ve won the runner up prize of a dollar gift card a few times so I can personally attest that the site is legit. 
 
Realpoints-   Realpoints has you download apps for points, but it’s good when you are almost up to a gift card and need a little bump.  

App Trailers-   Most everyone knows about this one but I’m putting it on here to make a case for it since I’ve heard a lot of complaining about it here on beermoney lately.  It pays out great when you first download it but the offers fall off quickly.  Most download apps don’t credit if you’ve already downloaded it somewhere else.  AppTrailers will often credit you when you download apps for other sites.  So even if you aren’t active on it you can still collect points.  Plus they have the daily scratch card that wins more often than not.  I hear they aren’t doing referrals any more.  Meh.

FreemyApps-   This has the highest payout to download ratio of all the apps that reward you for downloading other apps.  I’m still fuzzy on how this is a sustainable business practice but I’m gonna ride that wave till it crashes.  The offers trickle in slowly but that’s ok since sometimes you can earn enough points for a dollar giftcard in one download.  Plus

SuperGiftcardReward-   I almost never have offers to download apps on this one and I can usually get more points elsewhere but you get points just for logging in every day so I keep it around since I have to devote roughly two seconds to it a day.  

AppCasher-   This is yet another download more apps for points deal

Lucktastic-   This app has seven scratch-off tickets a day that will reliably not win money.  But you get coins that you can save up for a $25 gift card to Amazon if you are very patient.  You can also spend your coins on raffles for ipods and stuff but I’ve never done it because I’m saving up for the gift card.  They claim to be working on more content

Free App Slots-   This one you have to find in your safari browser and make a link to your phone that way.  I’m not sure how that works.  It links to your Facebook page to know who you are.  You get two free spins on a slot machine a day and can earn more spins for downloading other apps.  It’s kinda glitchy right now but I’m sticking with them because I have a lot of points that I should probably cash in but I’m holding off for no good reason.  

Feature Point- more download fodder.  I’m pretty sure this is connected to FreeAppWin.  It’s new and hasn’t had a lot of offers lately but it has been picking up lately.

Dailybreak-   This one is my favorite.  You answer trivia questions to earn coins that can be spent on raffles and auctions for some really cool stuff and gift cards.  I haven’t won anything yet but my girlfriend’s son and I play it together.  He learns stuff and thinks we are playing while I rack up coins with his elementary school knowledge of geography and pop culture that I’ve forgotten or ignored in my middle age.  

SweepstakesFree-   This is real simple.  You press a big red button and it enters you for a chance to win $20 daily.  You get coins for every press (ten a day

MobileRewards-   This has video

Offer Rewards-   This is an offshoot of AppTrailers.  Your apptrailer points even transfer over.  I wouldn’t even mention it but it has way more payout options than the other apps.  Ebay gift cards, Best buy cards, fucking pottery barn, Paypal and a bunch more.  

Fly Points-   This is an offshoot of Realpoints.  It’s more of the same.  If you downloaded all the other stuff you’ll probably be so sick of these apps you’ll never touch it but hey

Viggle-   With Viggle you hold your phone up to your TV when you watch something and it figures out what show you are watching and it gives you points.  I'm pretty sure I'm helping a government spy program but I use it anyway.  You only need to watch the show long enough to check in and it assumes you watch the whole thing.  If you check into something else it just unchecks you from the other show.  It has a sort of fantasy football game for more points during football games and trivia for other shows.  If you play it compulsivley for about four years a seven day cruise is available for 4 million points in the prize section.  Every once in a while Amazon giftcards will be available.

Mpoints-   I did Mpoint games for a week or so but I uninstalled them because the games all suck and I felt like a mouse hitting a button for pellets but I’m mentioning it because I heard about Mpoints for a while and could never figure out how it worked and their Facebook page sucks at telling you how to get started.  So I figured I’d help out any other confused people.  There is no app and there is no site to go to.  You just download one of the games/apps that are affiliated with Mpoints and it will sign you up from there via a grey bar at the bottom of the game.  You can start off with “Shoot da zombie”.

1360607596.0,18blo9,"My Daily Routine, some tips, earnings. ",Failedjedi,42,27, and my earnings are noticeably higher overall. So before I get into that some overall tips

I think it is much easier to sign up for a site, signing up for too many sites at once just gets you confused and makes you give up on the whole ""beermoney"" process. Use a site, develop a routine, then add another site. 

JunoWallet/Bamboo Wallet: This is [JunoWallet](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.junobe.android.junowallet&amp;amp;feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwxLDMsImNvbS5qdW5vYmUuYW5kcm9pZC5qdW5vd2FsbGV0Il0.) on android, is because this isn't a daily use app. The reason for this is they have a Monday bonus. It takes all your earnings from Monday, and on Tuesday morning you get a bonus that is 25% of what you earned on Monday. So I only use this app on Monday, and try to get as much out of it as I can for that bonus. You can sign up with my code ""TH1272839"" when making your account, and you will start off with $0.25. Cashout is via gift cards to various stores, with amounts varying per store. Amazon starts at $5. 

Ok

Firstly I open 2 windows of browser. I make the left window take up a small amount of screen space and put Gift Hulk treasure box there. I just occasionally click the treasure box while I do other beer money sites in the other window. So lets start with GiftHulk.

[GiftHulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/failedjedi) has you do various things for Hulk Coins. Complete offers, watch videos, etc. For the sake of this post I am only going to mention what I do. Every day I do the daily poll. Then I just do the treasure box in the one browser window. I have 146 daily clicks, a lot from referrals, and a lot from collecting bonus clicks as prizes every now and then. So I just click this every once in a while when doing other sites in the other window, until I use my daily clicks. That's it. This is all I do with gift hulk, it isn't a super high earner for me

Ok

[Swagbucks](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/hudiho) is almost the same as Gift Hulk. Same ways to earn minus the treasure box. So what I do is quickly do the daily poll, other than occasionally throughout the day I check to see if there is swag code available at sc-s.com for some bonus points. If you sign up now and use swag code 5THBIRTHDAY you will start with a bonus 90 Swag bucks. [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com)

[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/?rh=6661696C65646A656469) is next. This is a PTC site, and reinvesting the rest. This isn't a super fast earner, but I only do my 4 clicks and let my rented referrals do the rest. [non-ref](http://www.neobux.com)

Next is [mturk](http://www.mturk.com). I check out /r/hitsworthturkingfor and try to spend less than 10min here. I usually do a survey or two. I make about $0.50-$1.00 a day as my goal. For a while I did this exclusively and got sort of burnt out

[ClixSense](http://www.clixsense.com/?4870918) is next. It is a PTC like neobux. I usually do a click or 2 myself, and now have higher profits from referrals for the next 10 months. For sure worth it. [nonref](http://www.clixsense.com)

Next I go to bing rewards. I just do a search and click related a bunch until I hit my daily goal. 

Then [crowdini](http://www.crowdini.com). Just answer the question. answer in the majority and move on a day towards the prize. Takes about 10 seconds. 

Then I don't really do anything


Lastly is apps. I don't use these daily

[Ibotta](http://ibotta.com/r/ptBaQ) is a newer service (atleast to me) that pays you to shop. When you open the app you see all the options of items. When you hit the item they have various tasks, view the facebook page, etc. When you complete the tasks (you can do the tasks at home a head of time) you will get xx amount for buying the item. You simply buy the item, scan the barcode, upload a pic of the receipt and they deposit the amount in your account within 24 hours on weekdays. You have to have at least $5 to cash out and it is via PayPal. 

[Tapporo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tapporo&amp;amp;hl=en) is an android app very similar to bamboo wallet/junowallet made by the people who do gift hulk. It is not a gift hulk app, watch videos, complete offers and get points. Redeem points for rewards. They offer gift cards including amazon, as well as paypal. My referral code is TAPTH1423 and you will get a little bonus when you use it. 

[FreeMyApps](http://m.freemyapps.com/share/url/267a79c6) is an iOS app that has you try out apps for credits, so you can cash out often. The ratio of credits to dollars is the same as the higher values, so no reason to save up and wait.

[FeaturePoints](https://featurepoints.com/r/P31E9Q) is similar to freemyapps. It is for iOS. Try apps

[**NatureBucks**](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=mattgillan) or [Non-Ref](http://naturebucks.com/) **(£1.41)**
[Proof](http://imgur.com/g6InE)

This is the best site I can recommend. I have only spent the last 2 days trying to earn money on this site which is why I have so little. On each day I have made around £0.70 ($1.14) for about 20 minutes work. Basically you complete registrations




[**Superpoints**](http://superpoints.com/refer/mattgillan1) **(£5)**

I think most people know about this site however I've found it quite easy to get points by going to the tasks tab. I often get 100-200 points for doing 45 minutes worth of tasks and you only need 1200 points to get a £5 Amazon gift voucher. Also you have to be invited to the site in order to join which I why there is only a referral link.



[**Topline**](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=Y8JJYWRTBJ6Z) or [Non-Ref](https://www.jointopline.com/)

This as many of you know is a passive way of earning income by simply browsing the web as you would normally do so. Adverts are replaced by Topline's adverts and when you land on a page with those adverts you get a point. 1000 points = $0.75 however that is likely to increase (or so I've heard). So far I've only earned 850 points so I don't have any proof of payment and you need to reach $10 to cash out.

Well I've stumbled upon another gem. 

* Jebbit is a well designed site **for college students**, view the featured offer. However, there's a catch. You can accrue more points, which in turn, means more cash by proving you actually read each offer, or link. You are then able to gain points and a ""bonus"" by correctly answering questions about the featured link.

* EXAMPLE: My first jebbit was to a new sports website. I clicked the appropriate link and received the initial amount of $0.10. After that

* By getting consecutive answers correct, but rewards you accordingly. (With my jebbit of the sports website, it asked me where something was located when you navigate to a certain portion of the site)

* A very unique feature of this site is that it has its own store. This store is similar to Ebay. You can bid on certain items using points or cash.

* Pros - Minimum cashout for completing offers is only $2.00, Unique site structure

* Cons - Only for college students with an .edu email address

The likelihood of being picked up also goes up if you have a complete profile filled out (including a picture!) and if you really tried on your report. 


**Stuck on researching something?**

I help tons of researchers every day find the information they are looking for as an SR. Please take your time on your first report and really learn what we are looking for in the help files - it will only help you in the long run! Trust me.



**More Than BeerMoney**

My monthly expenses as a college student are right around $500/month with rent, and other miscellaneous things. If I spend an hour a day and write one report, I will make $600 every month.

1345558935.0,ykx7u,Regarding the recent downvoting of every comment. ,Failedjedi,64,36,15,"I have been active here for a little while now, and sharing any new sites is always welcome. Referral links are welcome as long as you provide information and a non referral link. Yet, even if the rules are met they get downvoted. This very obvious when someone asks for something specific. Recently someone asked for a list of sites that payout in paypal

Then, but unless you have a reason, downvoting every post with a referral link doesn't need to be done. If you go look at some of these posts people who comment without links stay at +1, but everyone who included a link in their comment gets downvoted. This isn't helping the community at all. If anything it is hurting it in the sense that if new people come and see a comment with a valid site, it gets downvoted a ton so they may think it is a scam.

I've barely touched Swagbucks this month since so many people were getting banned

It's another site that pays redeemable points for people who complete offers, and take surveys. 

The big earner on Swagbucks is the video option. If you have a smartphone, though many people are still doing it manually to get their daily points.

Searching is an easy way to get some points. After a few tries

**Neobux**

After PTC sites were a hot thing around here for a week or so

Neobux lets you use your on site earnings to rent referrals so you get paid for their clicks as long as you see ads each day.  On Neobux, but potentially can be worth it eventually. I currently have 12 rented referrals and an extra 44 cents or so available. With every batch of rented referrals, I have noticed a considerable increase in earning rate.

**Hubpages**

This one involves the most time but also has a lot more potential than most.

Hubpages is a nice option for people that like to write guides, poetry, and whatever else. Obviously, you could always do a blog with ads as well, which would have a bit more potential, but Hubpages is a little easier make something that looks nice in my opinion and it's a little easier to promote.

In March I only made $3.85 with 3 articles(mostly just from one of them that had a wider appeal), I'll promote things I've already promoted for a new surge of readers and more money. If I get a decent pool of articles to do this with, I can hopefully make some decent cash.

If you don't want to write

You can also refer new writers and get a matched amount for 10% of their lifetime earnings. Considering some, that could be pretty sweet.

I think it should be possible to do very well and become my biggest earner

**World Winner** 

This one may be US only if I remember correctly. Basically you play(or open and close) promoted flash games for points that can be redeemed for points. I got a **$50** Amazon card from it. Unfortunately there is a catch. You can really only redeem a reward once. That's because you need to be a ""cash player"" in order to redeem the points. That isn't a big problem in and of itself, you no longer get the promotions for large numbers of points. As such, I strongly suggest everyone save up for the $200 rewards instead of the $50 that I took.

[Slice the Pie](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=566666) / [Non-ref](http://www.slicethepie.com) You review music and get paid every 90 seconds.

Every 40 seconds or so it will refresh and you will earn money.I earn about $0.12 -$0.20 a day with auto surf and $0.05-$0.12 a day clicking on ads etc.

    Write for Textbroker
    Write for HubPages and earn with ad program
    Freelance copy-writing
    Niche sites a la Smart Passive Income
    Write an e-book and sell for $2.99 for Kindle

    Mystery shopping
    Create an app and sell for a dollar
    Teach English through Skype
    Fulfillment by Amazon
    Acquire and sell records on Discogs
    Sell stuff on Craigslist (lots)
    Sell stuff on eBay (vintage toys and games)
    Sell thrift and vintage goods on Etsy
    Create a garage sale-style Tumblr
    Sell text tees on Skreened
    Sell art prints on Society6
    Sell microstock photography through Shutterstock
    Get royalties on Quirky (one day)
    Buy and sell penny stocks
    Look for copper pennies and junk silver in pocket change
    Sell metal
    Sell gigs on Fiverr
    Usability testing for websites
    Freelance SEO

I've done some of these things with moderate success, but only if you don't buy too much stock from the get-go. If you can keep the job, you can easily meet the requirements by being a search engine evaluator. My HubPages accounts only reach around $.30 a day, but if I can get it to $3.33, then I can reach $100 per month.

What do you think? You do you know of any sites where you can sell specialty items? Have you had any success with any of these ideas

I'm not saying eBay is difficult, photo, setting start price), answering questions about posted items, confirming payment, printing address label and packaging item for shipment and taking the packages to the post office if you don't ship from home.
  

For me the answer was Glyde.com. I was introduced to Glyde via a free shipping deal where I purchased Assassin's Creed II for $6. Once I got my game in the mail in perfect condition and learned how the site worked, I have sold 8 of the 9 games I have listed. I just list them (takes about 3 minutes) and forget it.
  

Glyde is a place to buy or sell video games
  

**How Glyde works:**  
*Find a game
*Search by item title on Glyde.com.  
*Click on the version you are selling (which platform
*Click 'Sell this Game' then choose the condition from the descriptions that pop up by clicking on new, or disc only.  
*Choose a price using the up down arrows and see what your cut would be (there is a maximum price specific to each item so that can be a big downside)  
*Click on ['List for Sale'](http://i.imgur.com/tJNxx.png)
  

You're done. That's it
  

When something sells you will receive a 'congratulations you sold XXXX' email from Glyde. In about 3 days you receive a pre-addressed padded envelope and packing materials for the item. Open the envelope
  

In my experience, as you will run out of things in your house to sell, but I wish that I had known about this earlier and I am definitely making a dent in my stored games.
  

So far my earnings are $44.19. I use the term earnings loosely

Speedtest.net uses iAds exclusively and TV guide app uses other services as well as iAds.

Best strategy is just keep opening and closing the Speedtest app until you get the coke one.

I won $12.50 and an iPod before and got both. So it pays out fine. As well as a few gift cards since they started running the ad more. Use multiple emails and win multiple times. 

Quick edit: It says takes up to 48hours. I won twice today and both times got the code within 5 hours. Also both times gmail put it in spam

If your not using Bing Search Rewards and wondering what it is. It's Microsoft's way to incentive users to use Bing.  They're offering users points for searching each day which are redeemable for various gifts like Amazon Gift Cards, and Skype Minutes.  I would say its very similiar to Superpoints, in that you just search 20 times every day, do 1 bonus click for 3 points, and then every month pick up a $5 Amazon Gift Card.

Basically

Before I go and release this stuff to everyone here at beermoney

**==SUPERPOINTS==**

~~The Superpoints script I wrote is very simple, the other clicks the button as many times as you tell it.  There are better ways to do this, but I'm lazy.~~  So, I spent some time today looking into this and made this into a Chrome extension too.  I won't be able to test it until tomorrow, but it seemed easy enough once I figured out what I needed to do.  Currently there's only one negative point, but I'm not even sure if it's a problem:

**(a)** ~~The third-party software is not free (but it can be ""obtained"" for you scallywags)~~

**(b)** ~~By default the software runs in its own browser

**(c)** ~~You can run it in the background

**(d)** I understand that when you win 25+ points you get a referral link.  This script totally ignores that.  From the referral page

**==NEOBUX==**

Now on to Neobux.  From a technical perspective, it's a bit less detectable because you activate it by clicking a button in Chrome after you've logged in to Neobux.  It opens the ads and closes them in your Chrome browser, so it should appear much more ""human-like"" since it's nearly mimicking your behavior.  There are a few negative points here as well, some of which can be fixed:

**(a)** ~~I haven't quite finished automating the ""ad prize"" links; I personally find them pretty useless, so I added this.

**(b)** It doesn't actually CLICK the ads at the moment; I used a cheap method by grabbing the ad links and just having the extension open them by itself.  As far as I can tell this is currently undetectable by Neobux

**(c)** There's no sort of auto-refresh right now, but probably will not make it click constantly because that just seems downright bold and dangerous.

**(d)** ~~One problem I noticed is those silly sites that bring up the alert box saying ""Are you sure you want to leave this page!?""  I'm not totally sure if those cause a problem outside of the tab not being closed

As far as the Neobux bot goes

**==CLOSER

Well

I currently have no Superpoints referrals, just let me know you're interested in this thread.

I don't have a Neobux referral link because I've only been on there for about 3 weeks.  If everyone seems really interested in the Neobux Chrome extension then I'll try to smooth out any kinks and release it in the next 2 weeks.  By that time I should have a Neobux referral link for anyone who is signing up to use the bot.

**==WHO'S IN?==**

So tell me beermoney

P.S. If you have any daily tasks you want automated I may be able to help.  Let me know what it is and I'll see what I can do.

P.S.S. Start following [the337's guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/oq98x/superpoints_centralized_referral_document/) by putting your referrals into the spreadsheet.

Once you register an account and install the application your account will be listed as pending. I'll let the site's FAQ explain it all:

Gomez selects which PEERs to activate based on validated System Characteristics, and run the Gomez PEER application to accrue system activity. Only peers with accrued system activity will be made Active; the more accrued activity the more likely it is that a PEER will be activated when there is an increased demand for testing in your location.

Things I should not have bothered trying in the first place:

* signed up on too many sites at once—too many to keep up
* SuperPoints (never saw the shutdown coming at all \*stupid\*)
* Topline (even though I liked it at first and was amused by the pen ads)

Which will be more profitable:

- Updating old reports quarterly and getting their bonuses

OR

- Completing the same number of reports (26) that you currently have each quarter and not updating the previous quarter's.

Option 1 will take a little bit less time but you only get paid by bonuses

BUT

Option two will get you the $10 reward plus 3 months' worth of bonuses. And not only that but you also add $260 to the general fund.

I guess it is clear which the better option is.

Now how it works is you do searches on Bing, plus a 1-3 point daily click. Think of each point as a penny, 500 points is equivalent to 5 Dollars, or can be used for Xbox Live points or memberships, Amazon gift cards, something called the tango card which can be redeemed for a check regarding how much is on it, etc. 

Now the best thing to do with this, this will give you gold status, gold status takes a discount off everything you can redeem, so for instance an Xbox live points card for 400 points goes from 500 to 475, making it much easier to get more.

1. When posting your referral invite link please post it at the bottom so we can instruct new invitees to start from the top of the list to use an invite. 
2. If you have a position towards the top and your invite gets used and you want to put a new referral link please post it at the bottom of the list so we have kind of a rotation.
3. If you are new and use someone's link please mark it as dead. If you are new and click on someone's link and it's already been taken please mark it as dead so other's will know. Please don't delete it. Let the owner come back and delete it and post up a new link on his or her own.
4. Please limit the number of invites posted to five per person. This seems like a reasonable number but we could change this if we think it's too low or too high.

Find a niche you are interested in and create a blog about it. Then you do reviews or highlight certain products in your blog that you also advertise. 

**WARNING THIS WILL TAKE 1 DAY TO LEARN AND A FEW WEEKS TO BUILD** But hey, read on and research the internet.

***The Idea:** The first and foremost thing you must consider is the idea. You need something that is entirely original and that you know something about. What is the purpose of your blog going to be? Will you provide information? Will you sell a product? Deciding the concept and how you can present it should come before any hopes of making money with the blog. This is necessary to establish yourself and it also helps you keep your focus.

**The Brand:** Once you have an idea and have created the blog you will need to brand yourself. A brand is nothing more than your identity. Think of your favorite business and what do you see? Often a logo

**The Traffic:** Nothing is as important to your blog in the beginning as traffic. People need to be on your site to be reading it. This means you have to get them there. Short of emailing people

**The subscribers and List:** Once you have the traffic flow you need more. You need them to subscribe to your blog and join your mailing list. There are many ways to do this. Offer contests. Give away free items. Whatever you find that works is suitable as long as it encourages people to sign up.

**The Content:** Now that you have readers it is important to keep your content up to par. Your readers expect something from you and you want to give it. Think about your target audience. Imagine what they would like to see. Now take the time and write for them. This will make your content valuable and you will see better results.

**The Basic Concept**

Gympact is an app for iOS (yes, and then rewards you at the end of the week if you have met your pact and worked out as many days as you said you would.

A work out that counts must be at least 30 minutes
* a work out at your local gym (GPS verified
*  going running/walking/cycling/skating outside (download the sister app RunKeeper
*  working out at home (for this you have to strap your phone to you and meet a certain threshold of exertion for 30 minutes for it to count)

Where does the money come from to pay you?

Here's the catch: you know how you gave your credit card or Paypal details at the beginning? You also pledge an amount you agree to pay every day that you miss out of your pact. The minimum pledge is $5

The money you are paid for completing your pact comes from a pool of failed pacts. Thus it varies from week to week depending on how many people kept their pact. For me (iOS) it is usually $0.30 per day in my pact. The money you earn doesn't show up after each completed workout

It's not a lot of money, and if you already work out, you might as well get paid a few bucks for it.


**How do you get paid?**

You will get paid through Paypal

Minimum cashout is $10, or refer people yourself. You get $5 for your first workout if you enter in someone's referral code when signing up, and your referree also gets $5.

So far I've cashed out 3 times

Proof of payment: http://i170.photobucket.com/albums/u251/niyer09/Gympactproofofpayment_zpscb0fc90e.jpg


**What kind of payment info do you have to give when signing up?**

You have 3 options:
1) Your credit card number
2) Your Paypal email (and you have to give them permission to deduct from your Paypal balance or an account attached to your Paypal if the balance isn't sufficient) --&gt; this is what I use on my iPhone
3) OR the sneaky option of a Visa gift card number --&gt; this works


**Changing your pact/taking a break/stopping completely**

You can change the number of days in your pact

The week goes starts from Monday morning

If you want to take a break

There is also the option to delete your account completely.


**What do you do if you're sick?**

Gympact accepts copies of doctor's certificates


**Your credit card was charged when it shouldn't have been!**

I think this was more a problem with the older, customer service was really good about it, and very quickly refunded the charges made.

My experience with customer service has been great - they're really prompt in replying (usually on the same day)


**The Referral System**

As you're signing up, so that's already halfway to cashout!

Each person who signs up gets their own referral code at this link: http://gym-pact.com/friends

So you can then go on to refer other people, so it's really great.

1343250882.0,x5i4n,Does anybody use MyCokeRewards? There are codes on nearly all Coca-Cola products and can redeem for GCs and other goodies,gobeavs1,33,6,37,"Just wondering if anyone uses MyCokeRewards? I am not a Coke drinker but I know some of you might be. I've been able to snag about 200 points worth of codes in the past month from friends and family especially during BBQs and family gatherings where a lot of Coke gets mixed with Crown Royal :) There are codes under every cap and inside 12 packs of Coke brand products. See a complete list [here](http://www.mycokerewards.com/participatingBrands.do).

I'm sure there are some of you who drink Coca-Cola or are around Coke enough to be able to snag some codes. I think there's a limit on how many MCR points you can redeem per week. You can redeem for GCs and other merchandise. I've even heard of people selling their MCR points via online auctions (not eBay

There are several promos going on now where you can redeem 2 codes + a promo code and get extra codes per week. Here's a one of them happening for the Olympics.

For the one below

1. Enter 2 codes found on bottle caps = 6 points (two 12 packs can be used too)
2. Enter code London2012 to give you a Bonus Entry (a 3-pt value)
3. Enter the sweepstakes CHOOSE ONLY THE FREE ENTRY OPTION. DON'T SPEND MCR POINTS.
4. Scratch the sweepstakes as instructed (BTW I got a ""Sorry"".. so no instant prize for me)
5. Go back to main account and you'll see additional 10 points.

You can also use Coke2012

Keep in mind I don't like to talk a lot and keep things very brief; if you have questions ask away.

**Actives**

*Amazon's Mturk*

-This one by far is the highest paying out of all of the other ones. Tasks or HITs can be as short as 1 minute or less or they can be as long as 30 minutes. IT is a MUST to subscribe to [hitsworthturkingfor](http://www.reddit.com/r/HITsWorthTurkingFor/) and [mturk](http://www.reddit.com/r/mturk). Typically I only use the HITs that are on the subreddit as I usually find garbage ones that pay so little. You can make about $6-8 hourly on average. You can cash out to your bank at $10 USD or $1USD for gift cards. Sign up here [AmazonMturk](https://www.mturk.com/mturk/welcome)

*Swagbucks*

 -Typical complete offers/surveys/watch videos website. I mainly do the daily poll

*Hits4pay*

 -One of my favorites. They email you that they have ads to ""view"" and you click on them and do whatever you want in other tabs

*DealsnCash*

-Same thing as hits4pay and by same company

*Paidviewpoint*

-Very easy survey site. They send you 10-question surveys every day for usually 10 cents each. Every now and then you can get bonus surveys which will give you about $2 for an extra 10 questions or so. [Ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=d3kytv) and [Non-Ref](http://paidviewpoint.com) Cash out is $10 to paypal.

*Varolo*

-Watch ads and then rate them. They're usually 30 seconds long and every 5-7 ads pays out 1 cent. Not a very quick earner

*Cashcrate*

-This one is sort of like swagbucks. More offers

**Note**
-When signing up for offers use this site

**Mobile**

You usually can cash out for these immediately depending on what type of reward you want. They all offer a decent selection.


*AppTrailers*

-Exactly as it says. Get paid to watch trailers of apps while on the go.

*Appredeem*

-Same company as above and share a points balance. Download and rate apps.

*Viggle*

-Watch TV and get paid for it by checking in. 1 point per minute of watching.

**Passives**

*Vagex*

-Set up a Youtube player on desktop and on your browser. You get points for every view, etc. Slow earning but requires no effort once set up. [Ref](http://vagex.com/?ref=132305) and [Non-Ref](http://vagex.com) Minimum of $10 USD to cash out for Paypal.

*Topline*

-Install a browser add-on which replaces ads that you see with it's own ads.[Ref](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=2PNS7JLMSCLV) and [Non-Ref](https://www.jointopline.com) Minimum cash out is 10 USD Paypal.

*Bing Rewards*

-Search and get rewarded for it. You can have up to 5 different accounts that are referred together in the same household. You can also use these on different browsers but on the same PC. [Ref](http://www.bing.com/explore/rewards?PUBL=REFERAFRIEND&amp;CREA=RAW&amp;rrid=23B98AFA-1907-4B9A-84DE-A2B053B9B065) and [Non-Ref](http://www.bing.com/rewards). Minimum reward cash out is around 5 USD. Rewards can be used for gift card

*GomezPeer*

-This one performs simulations/calculations using your excess system resources. Slow earner but once set up it requires no effort. Takes a little while to get your account validated though. [Ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/application-apply/?Referrer=LetsMugSanta) and [Non-Ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com) Cash out is $5 USD to Paypal. Takes around two weeks to get account validated.

*I-Gagnant*

-This one is just a small window that displays ads while you work. Really negligble/not noticeable. Points add up pretty quick and can be transferred out through Paypal [Ref](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com/?u=LetsMugSanta&amp;lang=en) and [Non-ref](http://www.i-gagnant-barre.com) Balance must be over 15 euros to cash out.

There is also the *MetaTrader strategy tester* and *bitcoin mining*. I've already earned maybe close to $10 from these two alone. **Only** use these if you don't have to pay for your power. This will consume a lot of power.Use this site when setting them up. I do not take credit for the site.
 
[RobotPennies](http://robotpennies.blogspot.com/)

Keep in mind that the money is slow

**Note**
Mturk is the top earner by far. I can usually net around $100 a month from it by spending maybe 2-3 hours a day. The other active ones just compliment the additional beermoney pay. The mobile ones I usually use for when I'm not at my PC or already am and just looking to make some extra $ while my phone is charging. You could also use [Bluestacks](http://bluestacks.com/) to simulate an android phone

Basically, the points you get can range from 15 to over 1000. Each point is worth a cent, so 15 would be $0.15 and 1000 would be $10. 

The points you collected can then be redeemed for gift codes (iTunes

Android users can find the app in the Android Market.

Listia is an auction site. [ref](https://www.listia.com/signup/896763) / [non](http://www.listia.com)  No
  
The difference is that the auctions use points instead of cash.  And you get 1000 just for signing up.  And you can EARN these points by doing surveys and all that junk just like Swagbucks or other sites.  However

Second method (I used this one) clean out your room and organize the things you don't want into categories.  Don't include anything heavy, etc etc.  Keychains, weird things you made, whatever.  It will sell.  Your room will be cleaner.  You'll pay minimal shipping.  
  
What makes this different from eBay?  People have 1, so users toss it around randomly and ""pay"" for things they'd never sink real cash on.  
  
&gt;My Advice: build up a rep before selling any ""big ticket"" sets or items.  People are really into reputation there, and beg the buyer for feedback.  Include a nice note in the package imploring them to leave feedback.

**EDIT: Removed MegaTypers.**


**Postloop:** [ref](http://www.postloop.com/invite/Tyelander)/[non-ref](http://www.postloop.com/)

You sign up, the more forums you can post on. To get points, you sign up on other forums and make posts there, you gain points for each post you make on the forum. There are a limit to the amount of times you can post on a forum a day(5-10 posts). You need 100 points to withdraw which is $5. You can get roughly 1.7 points per post, so it isn't that hard to reach 100 points.

**PaidViewpoint:**[ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=Tyelander)/[non-ref](http://paidviewpoint.com/)

Daily Survey. You gain a ""TraitScore"" every time you do a survey. This is a very passive way to earn money because there is only 1 survey a day till you reach a TraitScore of 9000. You get $0.03 cents per survey that takes a minute to do(10 questions). The questions are practically the same everyday. 

**SliceThePie:** [ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=557385)/[non-ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/)

This is very straight forward. All you do is listen to a song for 90 seconds, you cannot say the same thing over and over again. Withdraw is $10.

**Webanswers:**[ref](http://www.webanswers.com/_tyelander/)/[non-ref](http://www.webanswers.com/)

InboxDollars has five main revenue streams for you to take advantage of: 1) Paid Emails, 4) Online games and videos, 5) Coupons.  There are also bonuses.  You can access them either through your email or through the website itself.  The website also offers activities, like MTurk HITs, but as that's not a unique feature, I'll not discuss it here.  There are also two ""gotchas"" that I'll explain at the end.  I'll look at each of these streams in more detail first, though. 

**Paid Emails**

Paid Emails are emails that they send you.  The emails contain a link, but it's usually between 3 and 12 (my personal low and high).  The content of the link is usually an offer from an affiliate, but it can also be from ID themselves.  The emails contain a link at the top of the page to take you to the ID website, and they contain a link at the bottom of the page to take you directly to the offer.  Clicking the link at the top to the ID website allows you to literally watch your current total go up because it takes you to the online dashboard, displaying your current totals as well as currently available surveys and emails.  Clicking the link directly from the email also pays out.  The thing about the email offers is that you can literally close the new tab as soon as it opens to the final page (and finishes its link referral process), and still get paid.  You are not forced to actually look at the page that opens.  Lastly, you can do them realtime as they come into your inbox, there is no benefit to either strategy.  FWIW

**Paid Surveys**

Every day, that's the time they allot for the surveys.  Generally, these three take me between 8 and 25 minutes to complete all three, occasionally longer if it's a particularly involved survey or contains videos.  In addition, you will get more survey opportunities in your inbox as they come available.  These survey opportunities show up in your inbox like the paid emails, but they are best done as soon to realtime as you can.  These additional surveys are limited time offers, and their values vary greatly.  I have never seen a survey worth less than $0.50, a fair few worth more than $3, the survey will have hit its limit before you get to it (often happens with the high-paying surveys), so keep your eyes open for those and jump on the chance.  In addition

**Offers rewards**

Like other sites, some are for purchases, some are for clubs, some are for simple actions.  Read the details of each offer closely.  Some of the trial offers require you to stay beyond the free trial in order to pay out, though most don't.  Some of the offers require you to lay out money first (like iBid2Save offer, which pays you $10 but requires you to purchase $5 of bids first).  The offers are a great way to do things you normally would do anyway, but make a little scratch off doing it.  For example, you can order flowers from ProPlants or ProFlowers and make $5; since it is something you would have done *anyway*

**Online Games and Videos**

Similar to the surveys, you watch a video, answer a few questions and make a few cents ($0.02 - $1.50, personal low and high).  There are also games, though I don't really understand how the games pay out.  I know you can make money playing them, but this is one arena that I haven't yet gotten my feet wet in. 

**Coupons**

The coupons are one of those double-whammy ones.  They are manufacturers coupons for every-day purchases (e.g., Save $1 on Planters peanuts) that are valid at any store.  In addition to the savings they provide you for the item you're purchasing, you also earn $0.10 for *every coupon* you print out and use.  That's right, if you do your regular grocery shopping and use five coupons, you've just made $0.50 *in addition to* the face value of the coupons!  These are fantastic.  All you need is a printer (mine is black and white) and some paper.  Then you select the coupons you want to redeem, print them out, and take them with you to the store.  I usually cut them out so the cashier has an easier time of it.  It takes a few days for them to show up in your account

**Gotchas**

There are two biggies, though, it's not difficult to make that $3.  The second thing is that your check will take a loooong time to process, something like six weeks, and you must be an active member until it is processed.  If you stop participating before they ship your check, they simply won't ship it.  (At least, that's what their disclaimers said when I was cashing out.)  However, something like $3, etc.  Lots of bonuses.  

**Summary**

There you have it, but it's really hit or miss with those.  In any case, I hope I've answered a lot of questions and made some of you interested, but if you have any questions about anything, feel free to ask.

How it works is you call a company that deals with life insurance, not forced, questions and stay on the call for a certain amount of time and you get paid very well. A 5 minute call can earn you $3 or more usually. You do not have to sign up for any trial, or submit any payment information so far as I know.

Some important tips when completing these calls:

 - Act natural. Don't try and drag things out. Ask questions that show real interest in the service

 - Provide real information

 - You must agree to the call being tracked/recorded

This is a huge and easy moneymaker

There are also many more opportunities to earn money on here. 

 - Daily surveys which can earn you $5 or more per day

 - Tons of cash offers

 - Cash searches

 - Daily slots for a chance to win a prize

**The Set Up**

First, create a filter in gmail that auto-deletes them).

Next, I can leave my rewards gmail account signed in on Firefox and my regular email signed in on Chrome, so I don't have to switch accounts. Two, so I can install the MyPoints and Swagbucks toolbars for points without jacking up my regular browser (I loathe toolbars.

In my rewards browser

A Swagbucks folder containing the following bookmarks:

* TV: http://video.swagbucks.com
* Inbox: http://www.swagbucks.com/g/inbox
* Daily Poll: http://swagbucks.com/p/polls
* NOSO: http://swagbucks.com/g/noso

* NatureBucks: http://naturebucks.com/members/clickPTC.php
* NatureDollars: http://naturedollars.com/members/clickPTC.php
* NatureClix: http://natureclix.com/members/clickPTC.php

An ""Other Daily"" folder containing the following bookmarks:

* MyPoints Easy Points: http://www.mypoints.com/emp/u/easy-points.vm
* SocialSci Studies: https://www.socialsci.com/participations/all
* Crowdini: http://crowdini.com

A Payout folder containing links to the rewards/cash out/etc site of each of my rewards sites

**The Routine**

* Open my rewards browser
* Check rewards email (pinned as app tab) for surveys and PTC emails.
* Right-click the Swagbucks bookmark folder and open all in tabs.
* Start a video in Swagbucks TV (1st tab) and leave it running while I do the rest of the routine. I start a new one as each one finishes. You get a few Swagbucks for every ... 5 videos I think? Just make sure to keep the tab open.
* Check Swagbucks Inbox (2nd tab) for any offers worth doing
* Do the daily poll (1 swagbuck with the occasional bonus video for 2 more swagbucks) and NOSO (2 or 3 swagbucks once I've clicked through all the offers)
* Right-click the PTC bookmark folder and open all in tabs.
* Do all the PTC offers on each page
* Right-click the Other Daily bookmark folder and open all in tabs.
* Check MyPoints Easy Points for offers worth doing. Also look for polls in the lower-right for 5 points each. Sometimes they're there
* Do any available SocialSci suveys
* Answer the daily Crowdini question

Voila! That's it! Depending on how close I am to the next reward in Swagbucks TV (there's a gauge in the upper-right), since it'll generate more points that way.

They pay 250 points an app and you have to use it for 30 seconds to get credit.  Crediting happens immediately.  250 points equates to $0.25. 

You can redeem points for Amazon or iTunes codes

If you sat with the program for a while you could easily make 2000 points in a half hour (at least initially) and I notice a new app at least twice a day.

1375122553.0,1jaj6a,Tips for Earning on Webanswers,nickolas223,35,11,1,"I began working on WebAnswers about 3 months ago.  I struggled early on.  I received very little adsense income and not many page views.  I struggled overall but had heard of people making very good income on there.  Web Answers

**First
You want to stick with the questions that get the most views.  These are going to be the following:


Legal

Health

Business

Computers

Finance


All get a large amount of views and have a high volume of questions.  I suggest playing expert in 2 of these fields.  That way you can stick to your specialties.

**How many answers do I need to make?**

Initially you need to respond 50 times to begin earning any income.  This is a lot of questions to answer and can burn you out quickly.  My strategy is to answer 5 questions a day.  2-3 receive very involved 1-2 paragraph answers and 2-3 receive short quick answers.  This way I answer a few questions each day without trying to write for 5 hours.

**How do I write quality posts?**

Grammar/Spelling/Punctuation

Length


These are the most important parts of your answer.  Make sure your responses have proper grammar and are long enough to answer the question.  You don't need to write an essay each time but writing a few paragraphs for 2-3 questions a day will help improve your quality score.

**Which Questions do I answer?**


My general strategy here is to pick a category.  Sort by ""Most Recent Questions"" and only show **Open** questions.  I then go down the list and look for questions with **few answers** and **high views**.


I shoot for **25+ views** and **3 or fewer answers**.


This gives me the best shot at garnering lots of page views and also having a shot at being awarded an answer.


My second strategy is to sort by Number of Replies (Low to High


With this strategy I am making about $40 a month after 3 months.  I have a good solid base of questions answered and as long as I keep responding to questions

I would suggest you check it out or if you have already signed up for it

This is a bit hard to explain

The problem with this is you cannot do anything else on your computer because it requires the mouse to stay on the window. I use to skip these offers for that reason

In order to do this you only need another windows open. Then do the following:

1. Start the timer for the offer.
2.  Once the timer starts
3. With the mouse over the non-overlapped portion of the original offer window
4. The timer should continue

If you have any questions please feel free to comment or PM Me.

EDIT If you are interested in joining a survey site the best advice I can give is:

Keep at it. Some surveys are interesting (like evaluating new product ideas) and some are boring as all hell but I've answered every survey invitation I've been sent.

Check your junk mail. I get a lot of surveys accidentally put in there.

Be patient. Sometimes there is a lag in survey invitations (might be why I've joined so many). Also some sites have your points/money as being 'pending' and even though it is yours and it will be added to your total you can't see it on the website until it is added after the waiting period (it can be a little discouraging).",,t5_2s5or,1354079253.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/13urxw/survey_sites_i_use_and_income_so_far_australia/

In my previous lurking sometime back in October I discovered FreeMyApps through this wonderful subreddit. I decided recently that I wanted to really update others on why you all should be using this great passive earner!

**The best feature of FreeMyApps:** Use it almost anywhere as long as you have your mobile device on you. It's for both iOS and Android! What's great is that the ""credits"" are device dependent. Meaning that if you have both an iPhone and an iPad (or any combination of iOS/Android device)

**How it works:** You visit FreeMyApps and install the featured apps from the iTunes App Store or Google Play store to your device. **You must open and run the app for at least 30 seconds** for it to give you credits. Then you can just uninstall the app if you don't want it. 99.9% of the time these apps are free. I can only remember one time since October that they've asked you to buy an app, Amazon.com credit, Hulu Plus subscription, Xbox Live, Groupon** and more! Most standard apps are worth 80 credits, but they post a pretty close to equal amount of apps worth between ~160-320 credits. Gift cards can be redeemed starting at 300 credits.

**My results:** In the past three months

Here's a screenshot from my last month. I redeemed 4500 credits on my iPhone December 6th and I already have 3975 credits again.

[screenshot!](http://imgur.com/T1xA3.jpg)

I was also on vacation for a week in December and didn't check the site once and still have this many credits in a month.

The apps have slowed down a bit since the holidays but are slowly picking back up. They've added a bunch more rewards though! If you take 5 minutes a day and check the site you can easily add $15/mo or more per device in rewards.

**EDIT:** I've calculated an average based on the apps I've downloaded and their respective credit payout. (iOS)

1356228330.0,15b2qf,"One month of ""passive income"" on Skreened: what I've learned",Alvur,33,11,18,"A few of you may remember [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/134ee9/earn_passive_income_from_shirt_designs_on_skreened/) from a few months ago from a guy making a decent chunk of change from POD t-shirt designs on Skreened. I decided to give it a shot and figured I'd check back in and let you know what I've learned and earned thus far.

I currently have two main active shops. One devoted to fitness themed shirts and another devoted to pop culture. I have about 30 designs total of which I have sold 5 (and 1 design twice). I am sitting pretty on $23 of profit. I have done some minor promotion via tumblr and twitter (posting each new design with related hashtags). Most traffic I've gotten to the site has come from two separate reddit posts (the first to /r/Fitness which ended poorly and has led to me mostly abandoning that shop). Thus far sales have had little to no correlation with traffic spikes.

**Lessons Learned:**

* Always use Anvil shirts as the base design. American Apparel is very expensive.
* Be careful about using memes. I based most of my fitness themed shirts around existing memes and was basically yelled out of the forum. I've also only sold one shirt from that product line. Not worth it. 
* Cash in on new and emerging trends as much as possible. Half of my sales come from designs based on [The Sloppy Swish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBzG0CCAx4U).
* Simple sells. I have found much better luck with shirts that are just text with maybe some fun fonts. I've seen much less interest come from designs that use graphics. 
* Don't over-think it or spend too much time on it. This is a passive income source but it could be a long time before you see a return on your investment (over two weeks before I made my first sale). I aim to spend 20 minutes or less per shirt. That way the time you invest can be paid back with just one sale (My commission is generally 3-4 bucks).
* Find a good balance between obscurity and popularity. Too obscure and nobody will look for your design. (I have sold exactly 0 IT Crowd or Finding Bigfoot themed shirts) Too popular and you'll be lost among all the others (Ditto for The Hobbit and Doctor Who). 

I think that more or less covers it. Skreened has yet to make me rich but it's a lot more fun than most other systems I've found here on beermoney. It's also always nice to get a notification that you made $4 while you were sleeping.

Anybody else using Skreened or another POD t-shirt distributor? What have your experiences been like? Any tips and tricks from the trenches?

I've been doing surveys for quite a long time with my gf and we've been earning a very nice side-income

From my least to most favourite:

* [Toluna](http://uk.toluna.com/) - Mixed opinion about it. 80000 points for £15 amazon voucher, so they can be chained easily. Sometimes they have 30000-40000 points surveys too but they are very rare.

* [Surveyhead (UK)](http://www.surveyhead.co.uk/) [(US)](http://www.surveyhead.com/) - (I'm only subscribed to the US site) $0.50-$5 surveys regularly, but they definitely pay. You also get pretty nice cash out of just filling out your profile. They have a sister site called gratispoints.com which is nearly identical but uses points, but I got too annoyed with it and never reached payout threshold.

* [YourSayPays](http://www.yoursaypays.co.uk/) - Very low pay on actual surveys (£0.25-£0.75) and paypal payout threshold of £20. However, and they regularly invite you for telephone surveys for £1. They also almost every month invite you to 1 or more webcam interviews for £5 each (you record and upload a video of yourself talking about a subject). Last month, I got £25 just for these, which was very nice. Overall a friendly and enjoyable site but no added bonuses.

* [Valued Opinions (UK)](https://valuedopinions.co.uk) [(US)](https://valuedopinions.com) - Very friendly site

* [Panelbase (UK) (ref)](https://www.panelbase.net/index.aspx?d=raf&amp;invid=21152&amp;pid=214906) [(non-ref)](https://panelbase.net) - Somewhat rare surveys but good payment on each (usually £1-£3). Min £10 to redeem

* [MySurvey (UK) (ref)](http://uk.mysurvey.com/index.cfm?action=Main.join&amp;r=10000181942) [(non-ref)](https://uk.mysurvey.com) [(US)](https://www.mysurvey.com/) - Surveys tend to come in waves (eg 1-2 quiet weeks, 345 points for £3, 575 points for £5. 

* [OpinionWorld](http://opinionworld.co.uk/) - My personal favourite. 1000 points for £10. Survey rewards are instant

The economics of why keeping bonuses makes sense:

Supply of labor:
- The number of people willing to complete a report for $20 instant cash is HIGH.
- Instant gratification
- The number of people willing to complete a report for revenue share is LOW
- We all do risk/reward in our heads everyday without thinking.
- 2-4 hours of my time - is it worth the CHANCE that this report may sell?
- Right now the probability of my report selling is VERY LOW (1/2500)*#ofreportssold/unittime
- This is near 0 right now.

The value of this company is in DATA and INFORMATION. The information part is what we are selling now - lots of data packed into easy to read reports. However, the more information you can sell.

The Numbers:

$20 per PR per report x 10
$10 per SR per report x 10

For $300,000 reports and can now sell unlimited subscriptions. Now let's extrapolate this more, with their 1,000,000 report goal of ""complete disruption"" in mind:

$20 PR reports x 1,000,000
$10 SR reports x 1,000,000
$30,000,000 reports, whereby they will disrupt the entire industry.

That number of reports would also give you close to a $100 million valuation assuming $100 per report. However,000,000 companies that gives you an INCREDIBLE view of market insights. You can now sell individual reports, subscriptions, and ""360 degree market intelligence"" that will be beyond valuable. What sectors are hiring? Who has seen the largest YTY growth? Which sectors are shrinking?

It makes NO SENSE for them not to continue to offer the bonuses indefinitely until they get to a point where one report simply isn't worth $30 to them any longer

[FusionCash](http://fca.sh/1f6jp) is a GPT site where they claim to offer the highest payouts and in my experience, I have never been given less than $1 for a survey of any length, and in many cases I've gotten more!

They also have a daily PTC and a daily cash email, too, but I don't usually have time for those. 

In addition to the offers, videos and most recently an offer wall. I can only speak for myself, but it's a lot easier for me when everything has an easy-to-understand monetary value, rather than points. Plus, there are bonus opportunities for things like survey disquals and posting to the forum. 

As for the easy $12

First of all, you can use the promo code 'video' when signing up for that to get a month free (instead of just the discounted price they are offering). This way, nothing hits your credit card and you can still get credited. I used my paypal to pay and cancelled within the month and had no problem with the credit being revoked etc. It's a pretty easy--and not to mention free--$7 to get you started on this site, which has a $25 cashout minimum.

I know many of you have used [BetaPunch](http://betapunch.com) to quench your thirst for beermoney in the past

I have been trying to brainstorm for a while what we could do to make the site more active so there are more opportunities for you guys to make money. I know many people have stated making as much as $30 / hour when times were good! I am also proud to announce that we have now paid out more than $4

There have been about 2-3 jobs listed per day

I was hoping we could start a conversation and brainstorm together a way that we could attract more websites to sign up and try out our service.

Something I have been thinking about is creating a referral system so you would be paid for referring new websites to BetaPunch. If a website signed up via your link you would get a percentage of however much money they spent purchasing testers via our service. We would automatically deposit the money right into your tester account.

Hi

I know a post like this gets posted every now and then but the question ""**what can I do as a non-US person?**"" gets also posted frequently. The more information on these kinds of sites and programs the better

I've written down my findings on some of the things I've tried out

* **Pollbuzzer**: You register your e-mail address where they will send you a question about once a month. If you respond to it

*Answer poll
[REF](http://pollbuzzer.com/?r=b25VY3UwSUpycngrK2VwNmY5RUhzZz090) [non-ref](http://pollbuzzer.com/)

* **Naturebucks**: Here you can click **ads** and do **offers** for which you get money and points (which can be converted to money). The offers are the best for the US but there are also good ones for other countries. I recommend looking at the most and newest credited. Because **the payout minimum is only $0.05** it's probably the best PTC/offers site for non-US.


*PTC, surveys; min $0.05* 
[REF](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://naturebucks.com/)


* **Nature Dollars**: The second in the ""Nature"" family. The same as the bucks one

[REF](http://naturedollars.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://naturedollars.com/)


* **Euro Piñata**: European Neobux is the best way I can describe it


*PTC (Neobux clone); min $2* 
[REF](http://www.euro-pinata.com/?r=Proim) [non-ref](http://www.euro-pinata.com)


* **Nature GPT**: The third of the ""Nature"" family. It's basically the same as the bucks one


*PTC, surveys; min $2* 
[REF](http://naturegpt.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://naturegpt.com/)


* **Natureclix**: The fourth of the ""Nature"" family. As the name suggests this one is more about **clicking ads**. There are more than on Naturebucks. But also here you have **offers**

*PTC, surveys; min: $5*
[REF](http://www.natureclix.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://www.natureclix.com)


* **Natureprizes**: The fifth one in the ""Nature"" family. Partly the same as the clix one. You can do **offers, **higher payout minimum ($5)**.

*Offers, ad clicking; min: $5*
[REF](http://natureprizes.com/members/register.php?ref=Proim) [non-ref](http://natureprizes.com)

* **Gomez Peer**: A **passive earner** that may or may not work good for your specific country. The idea is add give your computers calculation capacity to a network of other computers to join in a giant calculation machine. It can take a while for your account to be activated and working times can be low. Again **for some people it works

*Passive; min: $5*
[REF](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com/application-apply/?Referrer=proim) [non-ref](http://www.gomezpeerzone.com)

* **Clixsense**: One of the older and most prominent paid to click websites where you can **click adds, do tasks through Crowdflower and/or play the clixgrid**. You can earn a 5% bonus every day if you complete a list of things: 2 ads AND 15 clixgrid clicks AND (10 CrowdFlower tasks OR 2 offers OR 5 Crowdflower tasks and 1 offer) AND visit the forum. The **minimum payout ($8)** is rather high but you can do quite a lot, there are about **15 or more ads** to click every day. 


*PTC, clixgrid; min: $8*
[REF](http://www.clixsense.com/?4994939) [non-ref](http://www.clixsense.com)


* **Slice The Pie**: Absolutely **the most fun money earner** out there! You listen to a song for at least 90 seconds whilst **writing a short review** about the intro, the instruments, etc. This is to help the artist and you also get paid for the amount of work you put into your review. Just saying ""this sucks"" or ""this is awesome"" isn't going to help very much and thus you will only get the minimum pay. This should help writing a good review: [review help](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews). **Minimum payout is high ($10)** but it's really fun to do.

You can cash out with a variety of different options including  amazon cards from $1-$100 and $10-$100 for paypal.

Then

If you'd like to sign up under me

The cool thing about getting referrals is that they help your pact. So let's say you make a pact that you will go to the gym 4 days a week, but it could come in handy. I'm not sure if you still get money from a referral if you make your pact before they hit the gym though. 

My advice for beginners is to pick a reasonable pact to start. I actually work at a gym, the other times I'm there to workout. I could probably be fine with making a 4 day pact, but to be on the safe side, I just do a 3 day pact, because if I miss a day at the gym, and I don't go for a 30 minute run instead, I don't want to have to pay 5-10 bucks.

I recently started using the apps: Apptrailers. A neat little app that takes fairly little to manage but makes a nice chunk of change. aaaaand JunoWallet(m.junowallet.com and the BambooWallet app)

Before I start talking about tips and tricks I want to tell you a little secret. Even though each app is a mere 1/2 cent things add up quite fast. Another thing you have to do is start thinking long term! Let's say you make $3(4500 points) a day

Next thing is that I am going to be devoting this little guide towards the foreign beermoney-makers. I live in South-Africa and I still get the 5 point trailers as well as the major money earners! And in JunoWallet's side of things I get a lot more offers!

Okay I am done rambling let's get to business! First thing is fist, a bit slower)

So you go through paying for tunnelbear and then go to [this site](https://www.tunnelbear.com/ios)

YAY! Now you are able to view all those shiny offers worth 5+ points! As well as the plethora that JunoWallet's HTML5 app has to offer.

**Apptrailers:** Ref Code: gighespivs

Now this is what you are gonna do: If you want to make a bunch of points fast on Apptrailers(m.appredeem.com)

If your internet speed allows it, just reconnect. Make sure the little VPN icon is displaying at the top of your screen BEFORE entering the app!

Also remember you only have to watch the ad before the actual app trailer

Another thing to remember is to do the daily scratcher it is a free 15+ points if you win. NEVER do the other scratchers unless you are willing to part with your points.

Take note of the fact that the app is linked to your DEVICE not your login info. That means if you have a bunch of iOS devices you can use them all at once to get those scrumptious points. I am currently only using my iPhone and iPad. If you are using multiple devices login with the same details and dont use your own referral code.

**JunoWallet/Bamboowallet:** REF Code: CG869016

I feel that this earns money a lot quicker than apptrailers but they sometimes get limited in terms of apps. Using the same VPN you can login and behold the magic that is this app. 

**The actual app:**

Using the app is basically like using app trailers

**EDIT**: I misread

You will also be using this to cash out.

**The HTML-app**

Go to m.junowallet.com

Something to take note of is the fact that it takes 24 hours to pay out.

**BONUS!!!:**

Okay so a neat way I have found to make even more money is to use the cash I make via junowallet and buy iTunes gift cards with it. Then I use AppReviewer Pro ([Referral](https://m.appreviewerpro.com/?ref=yxwhkntt) / [Non-referral](https://m.appreviewerpro.com)) and buy the premium apps to review(also the free ones)

I sincerely hope this boosts your money making prowess on iOS devices

1345852478.0,ys60e,Datsoup v2,mrfrasha,23,3,13,"Alright guys. 

Datsoup v2 should be up and working. Keep in mind that there are bound to bugs that i missed. I NEED YOUR HELP TO FIND THEM! If you find a bug please please please send use the contact page and let me know about it. 

Functions:

1. User accounts - Yes everybody now needs to have an account in order to submit their referral codes. First off this helps cut down spam and garbage a decent amount. Second this ties into the new system of referral dumping.

2. Referral dumping is no longer. Instead you are required to log in once every 30 days and your codes will be kept. Forget to log in? Now you have to go back in and enter all of your codes. Not too much of a chore but still better just to login once a month er so. 

NOTE: you actually have to log out and then log back in. merely just visiting datsoup while logged in from a previous session doesn't work. You have to actually go out and then come back in. 

3. Unlimited Site capability. You'll notice in your profile section that you can create sites/referral pools. This is so that I don't have to do it and the site can grow as programs come along not just as I decide to add them. You should also have the referral URL without your ref code in it. your referral code and a description of what you have to do on the site. Your referral pools sucess depends greatly on your description and url copy and pasting. If you have a faulty URL nobody will be able to sign up with your link. and there goes all of those referrals you could have had. 

NOTE: send a message through contact us to get a url fixed/changed I decided to not give normal users this ability for obvious reasons.

DOUBLE NOTE: IF YOU PUT YOUR REF CODE IN THE REF URL IT WILL NOT WORK! 

so say you put www.referral.com/ref/mrfrasha in as the url when it really should have been www.referral.com/ref/ and then mrfrasha would go in the ref code box. If you do it the first way you will get something like this www.referral.com/ref/mrfrashaanotheruser

You can see where that doesn't work so please don't think you're gaming the system. your just being a pain.

4. New design! BUTTONS! - while i realize the design still lacks I do believe it look considerably better now that the blue is a bit darker and we actually have semi respectable buttons. So yeah. woohoo.

5. Database filtering - So we had to annoying users submitting shit like this in the previous version - mrfrASHA, etc. and the submission form would accept them and then they would have more referrals in there. well it still accepts them but now it deletes the extras out. Not sure if the culprits are redditors but that problem has been addressed and solved. So you're wasting your time if you do that.

So yeah. Please feel free to add sites that you use and to contact me about descriptions and URLs that are incorrect.

Also - I'm gonna be leaving mcdonalds in a bit so I can only answer questions for so long. If you don't know [now you know](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/yrv6d/datsoupcom_v2_the_adventure/)

Please ask here if you have any immeadite questions any question you have later you can you contact us to figure those out.

1344897283.0,y63pk,A Big Neobux Tip and a Good Reason To Join,Yvanblo,23,1,14,"If you haven't joined Neobux yet

This is all based around the huge fact that at Neobux you can use your FREE Neopoints to extend and recycle your referrals.

Neobux is constantly improving and one of the best new features is the ""offers"" section in which you can earn Neopoints for doing things.

THESE CAN NOT BE FORGOTTEN ABOUT! You get paid more $ worth in Neopoints than you do actual jobs in the Mini-jobs section that pay real money. Neobux practically throws Neopoints at you because it keeps you using their site and they've been paid from the advertisers already. This means it's super easy to get tons of free stuff.

In the past week

The mini jobs are a lot like MTurk. There are even Crowdflower jobs. Those pay only $.08 per job. In Neopoints? UP TO 70 POINTS! That's nearly an entire recycle! But these are laborious and I'm lazy :P so..

Some of the offers pay up to 2, family friends, and friends of family and you'll see how I'm rolling in the points ;) haha!

The biggest pro-tip: find easy

**[Neobux](http://www.neobux.com/forum/)**
This one is the main PTC site that people use. I currently invested $5 and rented 5 referrals. My rented average is roughly 1.3. I have one super active rented, and 1 inactive. I'm planning on getting another 20 referrals then focusing on recycling (might use auto-recycle.) No ref link since I've only used the site for 7 days. ($ 0.50 earned, $2 minimum payout.)

**[PaidViewPoint](http://paidviewpoint.com/?r=xdzy6w) / [nonref](http://paidviewpoint.com)**

**[Hits4Pay](http://hits4pay.com/members/index.cgi?dualspeed) / [nonref](http://hits4pay.com)**

**A Little History**

I had a Swagbucks account that I used and did everything manually and was maxing out SwagbucksTV and SBTV Mobile every day

I explained to them that I do everything manually and that this deactivation is in error. They didn't budge so I inquired if I could start another Swagbucks account

I e-mailed Swagbucks again and didn't get a response for about a week. I e-mailed them again


**My Take Away From This Whole Situation**

If you are a big earner on Swagbucks it makes you a target for deactivation, they can tell if someone is using a bot or not (repeated URLs from an auto-refresher are easy to spot). **Swagbucks CAN and WILL deactivate your account for any reason and they do not have to give you the reason.** Someone took a snippet from their ToS and posted it here recently but I thought I would reiterate that fact.

I've found several other sites that I signed up for in the thought that I would not be able to get my Swagbucks account back and at that point I wasn't going to risk signing up for another account just to get it banned.

Here are the sites I use and enjoy for those who haven't signed up for them yet.

A good portion of my SB have been earned by doing the offers more than once. I've noticed that some offers (such as the Mint.com offer that pays 80-110SB) appear on their site twice, I thought I *had* to use that one. But I don't. For the second Mint offer that I completed, I used another email and got credit. This also works for the offers that ask you to ""like"" or use an App via Facebook. Since you don't need to use the email associated with your account, you can also do offers that don't apply to you (such as Arthritis Kits, Disney shit, etc) but are worth it to do for the 30 seconds it takes for you to sign up for their emails.

I apologize if this is redundant or common knowledge. Any other SB tips? I'd welcome any advice.

And now for my shameless plug,  and shoot me a PM with your SB username so I can a) thank you and b) add you as friend on SB.

1326317280.0,ocwc3,My Long-Term Hubpages Leverage Method (For New Freelance Writers),Muxx,26,4,17,"Hey all, freelance writing and other methods.

At the peak of my online work

Today

*Note: This is a bit of a short-term/long-term method of leveraging your work to scale up your beer money earnings.*

**Step 1: Getting things planned (Overview)**

The first, will ultimately allow you to earn more in the long run while making a bit of money in the short term.

For me,000 words (not bad but I do bulk most of the time).

I recommend starting with Hubpages because:

* It gets you in the mode of writing
* You can earn money through Adsense
* You can leverage it

To get started, that 100 hubs will help you understand your style of writing, educate you in doing SEO work to optimize your articles and earn you a bit of money while they're sitting on the site.

In this 100 articles

Personally, speakers, printer, albums, etc.

From there

*Bonus: If you decide to write about hobbies/items you own - you can easily include links to Amazon

You can sign up at Hubpages below:

My Referral: [http://hubpages.com/_1000Hub/tour/hubpages/](http://hubpages.com/_1000Hub/tour/hubpages/)
Non Referral: [http://hubpages.com/](http://hubpages.com/)

**Step 2: Getting Started**

As I've mentioned, lists and the general type of articles you read every day are always winners in the long run. The goal is to create hubs that not only get you traffic (used for later purposes in your resume) but also earn you more income.

If I was starting over

* Write out a list of 100 articles I'd like to write
* Create a weekly planner of when (and how many) articles I'll write
* Ensure each article is optimized and hooks readers
* Find ways to interlink the articles (ex. Laptop Review -&gt; Mouse Review)
* Go back through

The key, you don't need to be an expert - if you've ever wrote a research paper or essay for class than you've got everything you need. Use your knowledge of finding info online to help in writing articles or simply write from your own perspective (when doing reviews and such).

**Step 3: Leverage Time**

Now you're in the long-term part of this thing.

As you're getting closer to your 100 article mark

Take some time to put together a freelance writing resume.

It's easier than you think. The key

For example: I have a blog that pulls in 40k visitors a month. Rather than saying ""yeah, on my resume ""Achieved 40,000 visitors a month through blogging - link"". People that read your resume will flip out because that's a MAJOR accomplishment.

In Hubpages

Additionally

You can find freelance writing leads:

* Problogger Job Board
* Craigslist
* Relevant blogs for the type of content you create
* Word-of-mouth

You don't need to spam people but get your resume out there. In a week

**Conclusion**

I've got to jump back into some work but I hope you find this helpful for the long-term.

It'll take a bit of time to get started but it's totally worth it if you do. Freelance writing

I'd appreciate if you used my referral link (you don't have to if you don't want) because I'm also making a goal of writing 1, let me know!

Auto-Surf is what I do every day.  A new browser window pops up and displays ads automatically.  Using noscript for firefox doesn't seem to effect it either.  So it runs in the background for part of the day and earns me around $0.15 each day

Clicking ads and watching videos is just like all the other PTC sites and you can usually earn around .05 to .20 a day depending on how much you work at it.  Lets say another $3.00 a month.

The twist here is that you can earn extra money by liking things on facebook.  This can earn you a little extra income.  I use my MyVegas profile for this so I don't annoy all my normal friends.  

Finally they also allow you to complete offers much like most GPT sites.  A lot of the offers have to do with other online money making sites which can be nice.  Especially if you were going to upgrade to a paid account at something like clixsense anyways

I'm trying to make a **big review** of slicethepie.com
Well because of this I had to experience everything concerning this site by myself and now I think I got quite efficient - since I'm making 12-21cts per review!

Well

* 20 years Old

* caucasian

* European with average English Skills

* and I have nothing to do with music in my rl!

***Getting Started***:

I started of with [this](http://chasmac.hubpages.com/hub/slicethepie-reviews) site, **consistent**, **well-shaped**, **instrumental accompaniments** etc.



Basically I just tried to throw in those words randomly and I worked well for me - but the problem was




***Taking it to the next level***:

I figured out that the review you're writing can't be too similiar to the last 2 reviews you wrote - I figured this out by testing it approx. 1h
I created three [lists](http://i.imgur.com/gDwfGPS.jpg)

**1. List**: tuneful vocal melody, well-structured, skilled artist

**2. List**: joyful guitar-chords, loving atmosphere

**3. List**: varied digital effects, superb recording quality

Those lists reminded me of what to write to get good money without the algorhythm slowing my work done!




***Keeping the work up***:

Once you hit the high payments you are more likely to drop really fast to normal payment. If you try your best it is easy to maintain the high payment - you just need to get some effort in.
I advise you not to visit the page without being motivated to follow the instructions above


***Examples***:

**18cts**: Cool slow entrance which fails to accomplish its goal to rise the tension, but there is nothing original about them, pretty basic for this genre! The vocal melody creates a loving atmosphere! The recording quality and the performance are superb! You seem to be very unexperienced, just keep on working!

***16cts***: Nice neat Intro, the digital effects are well chosen! The recording quality implicates professionality and the performance quality is high aswell! Very clear structure, great commercial potential! The artist seems to be creative and implicated that he has a big variety of voice-tones, cheers!

1329614037.0,pvwd5,Topline Tips,ZiggyDStarcraft,25,7,53,"**What is Topline?**

Topline is a browser plugin that works similarly to other adblock plugins but instead of blocking ads it replaces them with ads from the Topline network. You are rewarded with points everytime an ad is replaced with a Topline one. Points can then be traded in for Paypal cash. [Here is what it looks like in action](http://i.imgur.com/ii0qV.jpg).

The rate for trade in is currently 1000 points to $0.75 but the developers have said that this is likely to increase as they attract better ads and increase their bargaining power. You can check the current trade in value on the [ticker](https://www.jointopline.com/ticker). So far I seem to be getting between 100-200 points a day. Which is $4 or so a month

[non-referral](https://www.jointopline.com/) | [Referral](https://www.jointopline.com/register?fid=FK52G8RN3FW8) (Thank you!)

**Tips:**

Here are a few things I have discovered myself and what I have learned from contacting one of the devs

 - If you try to use the same account on two machines at once it cuts your earning rate by 50% for each machine. It sounds like this will kick in if you are signed into two machines at once so if you alternate between two computers its still a good idea to install and use it on both.

 - After some testing it appears that pages with 3-4 ads pay out more points than a page with one - though it is hard to be sure

 - Refreshing a single page or going back and forward between two pages doesn't seem to pay out points. Cycling through 10 or so does seem to. I'm not sure exactly how this works.

 - Ads replaced include: Adsense, which is kind of neat) and some ads from other networks. A lot of the more dodgy ad networks don't seem to be replaced yet. Chitika ads aren't replaced yet.

 - Synergizes nicely with Swagbucks and similar programs where you are browsing around a lot.

 - I earn really quickly when I am working on revenue sharing sites because I am often clicking around between pages with around 3 ads very quickly while editing. For reference I write on InfoBarrel

 - If you work with Adsense Topline is excellent - it prevents you from accidentally clicking your own ads and as a publisher you shouldn't really be clicking ads ever. PLus you see more ads than the average surfer.

 - Stumbleupon doesn't work if you use the SU frame at the top as javascript will only run on the parent frame. I'm going to look into running SU without the frame and see how well that works.

 - Disable Topline when visiting sites you would like to support (if your not an adsense publisher). A lot of people try to scratch out a living or pay for hosting by making content and getting a few dollars from Adsense ads - support them if you like their work. At the moment the disable feature is a time disable but the devs promise to add a website exclusion list soon (Topline is still in Beta). 

If you have any more questions feel free to ask and I'll answer them as best I can!

1327604427.0,oxxek,Identifying the various different types of scams and schemes,thebluewonderland,22,3,4,"**Intro**

I saw a thread a little while ago about various ways we can improve this subreddit to get more subscribers, I realized that most people don't know how to identify a scam. While in that instance they were correct in it being a scam, just not the proper term for the scam, sure you can say that it is all logistics and a scam is a scam regardless of what you call it, knowing what exactly makes something a scam or have a high risk of being a scam can be valuable, and could save your financial life one day (some people lose horrible amounts of money they can't afford to lose to some higher-level scams, see: Madoff's victims).

If you'd like something added into this thread, so if have something to contribute, don't hesitate. 

**Common**

* **The Pyramid Scheme**
&gt; A pyramid scheme in short is a business that operates on multiple levels, by most people's standards, Starbucks, McDonalds, Verizon Wireless, Taco Bell, T-Mobile, and 7-Eleven are pyramid schemes. The list doesn't come close to ending there. What would define something as a ""pyramid scheme"" vs a franchises is determined by a few simple things.   A pyramid scheme typically has an unsustainable business model. This is what I believe to be the core difference. Let's use an example, and you got it from a brick and mortar shop. If you wanted to and have the money, much more reputable outlets). It appears that the only way to actually use the product is to sign up to become a referrer so you can ""get rich"". So as you can see

* **The Ponzi Scheme**
&gt;Ponzi schemes are similar to a pyramid scheme, then in one way or another, they will return the money + extra to you (except this is done with many many people). The way the subjects are found vary greatly from ponzi to another, and the way the money is ""made"" for you can also vary. One example that is showing up online a lot lately are HYIPs, or High-Yield Investment Plans, I'll give a vague example of how these work. You and 10 other people put $100 into a HYIP that offers 2% ROI daily. Tomorrow, 10 more people put $100 into the program, $2 goes to each of the people from the day before, but this is just to do that and the referral side of it does not have the emphasis (usually). 

* **419s (AKA Nigerian Prince)**
&gt;While this one should be painfully obvious (and if you don't find it obvious,000,000 in their bank account. These are scams 100% of the time.

* **MLMs**
&gt;I'm going to make a statement here that some of you may disagree with. MLMs are not scams. Amway is not a scam, being a independent business owner (IBO), is running a business. If you lack the knowledge/skills for running a business, then you should not attempt to run a business. That is not to say that the recruiters (other IBO who wants you to join) will tell you that though. Many recruiters will tell people that ""anybody can do it"", this is not true. If you don't think you are a business minded person, and have no experience in the business world, than a MLM isn't for you. It should be noted that many MLMs are actually pyramid schemes in disguise, if the business does not have a sustainable business model and focuses on recruiting

Now don't get too excited as you might take a little longer to do a review and count in load times (a few seconds over and over add up). There is an energy limit of 10 and each review uses 1 energy.

It's called You Never Lose/ Youneverlose.com and it's essentially a penny auction website where giftcards get auctioned off for pennies on the dollar. Most pennny auction websites charge you per bid which, the bids are free! Well sort of, bids cost a dollar each- but you get that dollar back in a giftcard. For example, I signed up on the website and bought a $25 sears giftcard for $25 dollars and the site also gave me 25 free bids to use on their penny auction- and I ended up winning a $15 itunes giftcard for $0.25. So that's $40 in giftcards for only $25... and I ended up selling both the giftcards on ebay for about $40.
It's a little confusing to understand the process at first

The local poll was more interesting/involved.  The app tracks where you are and finds businesses near you that need information or that they need information about.  I happened to be in Safeway and started the app.  They had a survey worth $15.00.  In it I had to scan barcodes of frozen food items and answer questions about them (if they were on sale, etc.).  I had to scan five items.

My main strategy is to browse HWTF and once those are done to search for 16 cent or more HITS that I'm qualified for. If I'm really bored I'll do repeatable CrowdSource HITS. Overall

This site is very intriguing. Basically you get paid to click ads. You also get paid for the ads your referrals click. You can rent referrals for a fee which is where the big money comes from. It's much like investing except you need to click ads every day, depending on how active they are.

I'm probably going to rent another 50 or 100 referrals when I get $20 from Mturk, but like I said, I treat it as an investment.

One note: I found that my referral average dropped randomly when I stopped doing Adprize clicks. When I started again

**Slicethepie** [ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/?wyd=451738) [non-ref](http://www.slicethepie.com/)

This site is not the best money maker, you listen to music and review it. In exchange you get paid between 5 and 25 cents, based on how high quality their script thinks the review is. Commenting on the whole of the song and using specific musical terms (melody, percussion, tone, mood, syncopation

**Topline**: [ref](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=MTJ3JZH3BS7T) [non-ref](http://www.jointopline.com)

Topline is entirely passive. What it does is replace advertisements on websites and gives you a point for each page with an ad you visit. 1000 points is worth 75 cents (subject to change). I've accrued just over 4700 points in 2 months. You can cash out at $10 so with moderate browsing you can cash out twice a year. It might not seem like much

**Bing Rewards** [Ref](http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=9778718&amp;rrid=_7c4a93aa-ebc5-34e0-fa04-7d08757be871) [non-ref](http://www.bing.com)

Essentially, then 1 point per 2 searches (up to 15 points a day). Points are worth roughly a cent a piece (a bit more if you get gold status, which is easy). I see no reason not to at least use Bing for the rewards. There are ways to get the rewards while still getting the Google search results, but that seems a bit sketchy to me, so I avoid it.

**Superpoints**: [Ref](http://superpoints.com/refer/tportersj) [non-ref](http://www.superpoints.com)

Superpoints is a very simple site. Click the superlucky button to get points Trade the points in for Amazon gift cards. There are other things to do on the site but I have not bothered with them because I prefer to not invest much time (plus I can make more for the time on Mturk then doing offers on superpoints.) The main point of this site is the referrals. Once you get 2 referrals and fill out basic profile info you earn all the points your referrals do

**Gifthulk** [Ref](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/tj_porter_16) [Non-ref](http://www.gifthulk.com)

One of my first checks **(PROOF)** --http://i.imgur.com/Gseh4.jpg

They support PayPal as well! **(PROOF)** --http://imgur.com/Xsgqa

You've all heard about the sites that pay you to pay surveys and this is the best one that I've come across so far. I've also tried cash crate

Here's some tips to maximize your profits from the site.

* Get a Chrome extension called Last Pass. It automatically will fill out your information so you don't have to waste time typing it all out. This saves **SOO** much time when filling to surveys. Google Autofill also works well.
* Fill out the free surveys with cash rewards. These are the ones that take the least time to complete and add up quickly. They range anywhere from .25-1.00 per survey. With the auto fill extension

* Make sure you use an **alternate email address**. You will get spammed like crazy. I would recommend Gmail because of the Google Voice feature. You can sign up for a free phone number in replacement of your actual phone number. This comes in handy for offers that require a phone number to prevent your phone from being called by telemarketers. If you connect it to your cell phone

* Whenever logging off Treasure Trooper

* Overall

* Make sure to collect pearls after you complete a survey. Once you have 8

So those are the tips that I've used to accumulate my earnings so far. If you have any tips, should consider this site. I spend about 2-5 hours a week and earn $100 a month on average.

First

STP is unlike mTurk in that you cannot pump out mindless work to generate reliable money. Significant earnings only come from quality work. Furthermore

I think the key to being successful on STP is to enjoy what you're doing. That way

Aside from getting banned, but I think there are a few limits the site puts on the number of tracks you can review. When I've submitted lower quality reviews this comes up more often.

Reviews also seem to be checked by their human staff regularly, to be fair, warn you of).

Not everyone seems to have been given the choice

Some additional tips:
  
* If you want to listen to a song again

* Avoid ratings of 1-3 or 8-10 most of the time. Your accuracy, is based on how closely you rate to the average reviewer.  

* Stick to your guns if you get a ""rating significantly different than review"" message. I've seen my user rating increase after I've refused to alter my rating despite this message.  

* Here are some song aspects I try to include in all reviews:

	* Introduction

	* Arrangement (how the song seems broken up into sections

	* Pace vs Length

And getting to Basic isn't that difficult.  In order to reach basic all you need to do is validate your email and provide some information to the site.

I bring this up as I magically had someone sign up under me last night.  Hurrah, I'm on my way to GOLD!  Then I noticed that both people signed up under me had not completed the requirements for basic membership.  Without two (2) Basic level members I'm still stuck at basic myself (rats!).  I knew who one of the people under me was, so I sent them a friendly PM here on reddit.  I have no clue who this second person is, but I am assuming they came from here so maybe they'll see this post and go update their account to basic.

Also, so even if you don't bother with SuperPoints anymore go bump yourself up to Basic if you haven't already.

**You, as you start building your own network and reach Gold you will be given 50 clicks and at Platinum you'll have 100 daily clicks (plus all the winning clicks made by your network will be shared with you, too).  So come on, there's no reason not to make certain your account reaches the Basic level when you join SuperPoints!

I will constantly be doing mturking on that monitor throughout the workday. My mturk gains will be deposited into my

A gmail alert that tells me when I have a **paidviewpoint** or **pollbuzzer** survey.


An addon that tells me when I have adds to click on neobux.


The swagbucks toolbar for similar notifications.

Ive been using viggle for a about a month now

Quote from their site: &gt;Check into your favorite TV shows with Viggle and get great rewards such as movie tickets, much more. All just for watching the TV shows you love

Its really easy. You just check in to ANY tv show and earn a point a min.
You can watch a ton of ads
It cost 7

They have daily bonuses for checking in to certain shows

**TIPS**
* You do not need to be near a TV at all. Just fail the Check in twice and type what you want in.

* If its early and nothing is on i always check in to STARZ or some movie channel

* ADS. Watch them. If you run out of ads you can sometimes force more. i can watch them for hours straight some times.
to ""force"" more ads if your all out and only have those viggle ones
once you watch an ad, 9/10 times it reloads and you can watch it again. once you get a viggle ad go to what people are watching and click each show, sometimes you will get some ads. Click back and click the same show again. Hard to explain but you'll figure it out. 
30 sec videos are the best. 
 
* keep an eye out for special events


They do offer some other gift cards

I think there is a 6000 point limit a day.

It seems like initially Predicto gets the most questions to answer and Tv Txtr the least but it evens out once you are doing it daily. The only annoying thing is the time it takes to slog through the first big bunch of questions because you have to enter CAPTCHAS and it takes a few seconds for ""processing"" in between questions.

**Bing Rewards** - $5

Bing Rewards definitely isn't going to make you an instant-millionaire.  However

The way Bing Rewards works is that you gain additional points by performing bing searches each day.  You can gain 20 points each day through search, you can get about 20-35 points a day though.  That's roughly equal to $5-10  a month for 20-30 seconds of your time every morning.  Not bad!

From Google Chrome’s Tools menu select “Open the following pages:” under the Basics tab. Add addresses based on what programs you’d like opened. 

From Mozilla Firefox's Tools menu, and enter site addresses separated by a pipe, “|” (Shift+\). Sites can be opened in tabs with the ""Use Current Pages"" button.

Essentially you will earn money by letting their program run on your computer to utilize unused processing power.  Signing up now will earn you a higher tier position and will result in more earnings when the site launches. 

There are no threads to purchase

Here is a quote from their main site:

&gt;Our Mission is simple - To purchase unused computer processing power at a fair price, planning, and execution. To maintain a viable, desirable service at an attractive price, while fairly compensating everyone that is involved.


What I like about this is that they seem very upfront about this project. They have a nice FAQ on the site which covers some issues that I have with other similar programs:

&gt;But XYZ Company pays $1 a day for my (Insert your 20 year old computer name here) - They won't for long. There is no process, deep down, you already knew this.

Clearly they are referring to DigitalGeneration with this quote. DigitalGeneration seemed enticing

Here's another quote: 

&gt;Do you really show your financial statements? - Absolutely yes. We strongly believe our slogan - ""Authenticity and Accountability thru Transparancy"". You are trusting us


Overall, if this generates decent profit it will definitely be beneficial to get in on it on the ground floor.

I've been signed up to Great Bridge Group [Ref](https://www.greatbridgegroup.com/?referralCode=oRpB_Q4mq8_8VkdVdBDlMg) | [No Ref](https://www.greatbridgegroup.com/) ($5 bonus for both of us if you use referral link) for about 6 months now and it's by far one of the easiest ways to earn extra money. In exchange for sharing your purchase history they pay you .25% of every purchase. Think of it as turning your 1% cash back credit card into a 1.25% cashback card. You grant access in the same way you would for Mint or Quicken so they can read your data. They anonymously sell the data and net a bit of margin.

They don't collect your name, but I was still a bit sketched out about security at first. I don't linked my checking account only my credit cards which have more protection, but so far I've been paid over $50. Payment is in the form of Paypal transfers, Amazon GCs, or donations to charity and occurs every 90 days.

*How does Great Bridge keep me protected?*
We use Yodlee (the back-end provider of aggregation technology for over 200 banks including Bank of America and USAA)

*Can my Great Bridge account be used to access my financial accounts?*

FusionCash has several different ways to earn money. 

* $5.00 Signup Bonus! 
* The Daily Cash email ($0.02
* Paid To Click is a quick $0.15 every day. 
* Daily FC Surveys
* Daily Tasks
* Various other Surveys
* Paid To Post (get $3.00 per month for posting 30 times to the forum)
    
Once you've gotten familiar with the various offers
    
**Cashout**
    
Cashout amount is $25, but don't forget about it!
    
**Referrals**
    
I don't have any referrals yet (that's why I'm posting this!)

* Refer a friend who confirms his/her email address: $1 bonus 
* Your friend completes his/her first offer: $2 bonus 
* Your friend cashes out: $5 bonus (each and every time they cashout - for life) 
    
**My daily routine:**
  
* The first thing I do every day is click on the Daily Cash email I get. It only pays $0.02
* Then I go the Offers page and my Bookmarked items. 
* First, one sponsored ad in the ""STEP2: SPONSERS"" section and then you have to wait for the countdown (from 3 minutes) in ""STEP3: REDEEM"" to complete. Once the 3 minutes are up, there will be two links under the Redeem section. You may have to click the Refresh (and you don't see the second one until you've clicked the first). 
* Next
  
**Stuff I May Start Doing Regularly**
  
* I've only done the Paid Videos a couple of times, without waiting for each one to finish and still get credit for all of them (keep in mind that you do have to let them all finish at some point or you won't get credit). Videos only pay $0.01 to $0.03 which is why I hadn't been regularly doing them. However, I may give it a try again with this new way of doing it ... and I'll obviously want to turn off my sound!!  ;0) 
* There is a Contests &amp; Promotions section in the Forum which I only became aware of today. Every weekend they have a mini-promotion giveaway for answering trivia questions or other simple items. Example right now is a ""survey"" asking what about your New Years Resolution is. They don't pay much (the New Years one is $0.02), following FusionCash on Twitter, etc. 
  
**Stuff I Don't Do:**
  
* I've not bothered with the ""Paid To Post"" forum postings that I mentioned at the beginning of this blog post. Too much of a time-waster in my opinion
* I also don't do any games for the same reason (time-waster)
* The Daily Tasks seem to me to take too much time for what you get paid. Maybe it's just me though

So far

- Gomez PEER
Read that it'll cost you much more in electricity than the actual pay out. But have also read that it's actually pretty stable once you get around a month. $10 can be a standard

- Swagbucks
Do not like the surveys, a daily routine? May consider

- Topline
Not high maintenance. But a check here.

- MetaTrader 5
Cannot consider. Reviews lean more to counter productivity.

- BTC Mining
Do not have dedicated CPU's so def. Counter productive. I love the idea of BTCs but this cannot work.

- Vagex
Seems like a lot of work. Will pass

- Pollbuzzer
Sort of manual but it sends a poll to your email

- Bing Rewards
Searches capped at 15 points a day

I think the most efficient ones can be: Bing search

I'm not a scientist I'm wondering opinions about passive earners and which can slightly be regarded as productive and not counter productive.

1346613282.0,z8pjz,Guides to my five favorite Beermoney sites,MrIcepick,25,8,17,"I’ve finally decided to post guides for my five favorite Beermoney sites

----

[Swagbucks]( http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker) is my most consistent earner

**Daily Poll** - Each day has a daily poll

**NOSO** - No Obligation Special Offers are available every day

**Search** - It is possible to win up to 4 times a day from searching

**Swagbucks TV** - This is my largest source of Swagbucks

**Referrals** - When a referral wins from searching

**Daily Goal** - If you reach the daily goal, and if you make 7 or more days in a row you will get another bonus for that as well.

When you redeem a gift card, I easily earn five $5 Amazon Gift Cards a month. If you are interested you can sign up under [my referral link here](http://www.swagbucks.com/refer/fire741cracker), or a [non-ref](http://www.swagbucks.com).

----

[Topline](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) is a great passive way to earn money. It is an internet add-on that replaces advertisements with its own, with no referrals it took me 2 months to reach $10 and cash out. [Here is my referral link](https://www.jointopline.com/?fid=67W2PL7TJ55P) to sign up, or a [non-ref]( https://www.jointopline.com).

----

[Naturebucks](http://naturebucks.com/members/register.php?ref=fire741cracker) pays you to do very simple tasks like sign up for an email newsletter, and pay anywhere from $0.05 to $1.00. The things I like most about Naturebucks are bolded below.

**Minimum payout of 0.05** to Paypal

**Prompt payment** – Payout is instant for Paypal

**Five tiers of referrals** – Naturebucks gives you 20% of what your referrals make

**Bonus** – If you manage to get to $20.00 (this includes what you get from referrals), you can cash out as you go and once you hit 20.00 for your account’s lifetime you get the bonus. You can get the bonus multiple times, at each increment of twenty, so 20, 40, 60 and so on.

I have the best luck with offers that are under the Most Credited or Recently Credited columns

----

[Gifthulk](http://www.gifthulk.com/refer/fire741cracker) is a great site that pays out to Paypal and Amazon gift cards. The $5 Amazon GC’s are the cheapest

**Daily Poll** - Each day there will be a new daily poll. You earn 1 Hulk Coin for each daily poll.

**Search** - I win about 2-3 times every day by searching. Prizes vary between hulk coins, permanent keys and store discounts.

**Treasure Box** - Each day you start off with 5 Daily Keys + however many “Permanent Keys” you have. Each key lets you open the Treasure Box, permanent keys, Fountain of Youth codes (like swag codes), boosts and even Amazon gift cards. This is like spinning the Superlucky Button on Superpoints.

**Fountain of Youth** – Enter codes to get free Hulk Coins. FOY codes are released on Gifthulk’s Facebook

**Referrals** – Each referral that earns 50 Hulk Coins gives you 1 permanent key to the treasure box. You also win 20% of your referrals Hulk Coins from searching, EZ coins, tasks and surveys. There is no limit on how much you can earn from your referrals.

**Offer Wall** – This has offers that do not cost anything, doing surveys, or signing up for an email newsletter. It also awards you for signing up for free trials, though you will have to cancel them before the trial period is over. The offers listed as “EZ Coins” are the easiest to do, and completing EZ Coins offers worth more than 10 Hulk Coins will also give you a treasure box key.

**Gifthulk TV** - Watch a round of 10 videos and get 2 Hulk Coins. Videos credit after about 20 seconds. You also get a bonus for the 5th

All prizes are given out on Sundays

1344467098.0,xwphh,A pretty great method I figured out for swagbucks,ReservoirDog316,26,11,54,"Been debating on writing this out for a few weeks but I figured I'd do it now since it could make you all a lot on swagbucks like it's been doing for me.  

It's pretty simple I think.  To start out, do an offer here or there.  That stuff.  

Just use swagbucks like you normally would and redeem a few things but most importantly

Before anything, use [this](http://imgur.com/7PW9C) instead. It takes one more click than usual but you'll get a steady build up of points that way.  You can get probably a $5 amazon giftcard every week or two doing that.  Also, don't search for random bunches of letters like ""adkfjld"" or ""eoirueoev"" cause [they will find out](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).

Anyways

1.  I downloaded the extensions No Script, I use chrome for actual internet usage while I let what I'm about to explain do it's thing).  

2.  Then I went to swagbucks tv and blocked all scripts except swagbucks.com

3.  Then I made an imacros thing with the following actions:

VERSION BUILD=7401110 RECORDER=FX

TAB CLOSEALLOTHERS

TAB T=1

URL GOTO=http://start.mozilla.org/en-US/

CLICK X=235 Y=202

TAG POS=1 TYPE=INPUT:TEXT FORM=NAME:f ATTR=ID:sf

CLICK X=277 Y=316

WAIT SECONDS=57

CLICK X=302 Y=176

WAIT SECONDS=9

CLICK X=274 Y=365

WAIT SECONDS=58

To make that into an imacro

I made a few of those but replace the word ""tech"" in line 7 with the word ""food"" or ""trailers"" so it watches different videos [so I can alternate between them occasionally so it doesn't look like I'm always watching the same videos all the time](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/paranoid-parrot).

It took a bit of work but I got it just right through a lot of trial and error.  Hopefully it works on your screen since it's made of the x/y position on my screen under the x/y mouse clicking setting on imacros (that I can only find on the firefox version of imacros by the way).  If it doesn't work

So you put the repeat macro to 75 and it should get you around 75 swagbucks a day (the maximum given out per day on swagbucks tv).  That should let you press play and it auto-watches 3 videos 75 times.  It's not much but I prefer it that way in case anything goes wrong somewhere in there

In retrospect

If you need a clearer explanation

You can get firefox [here](http://mozilla-firefox.todownload.com/?gclid=CK3QopyN2bECFYhgTAod1X4AaQ)

So with that all in mind

I just got an email back from NatureBucks and it confirmed what Casistrophic said that it is a single account only.  Here is the response I received from NatureBucks: 

&gt;Unfortunately, that would mean, one account per household. The reason is that advertisers would prefer only one user per IP address completing their offers (to make sure that one person doesn't do their offers multiple times).

I started a fresh account and started earning Swagbucks again and everything was nice and happy, the page would load but I couldn't update my personal preferences and didn't have any surveys. I eventually e-mailed the Trusted Survey's support and found that I had my account banned because I had registered multiple accounts.

As far as I can tell, it created a ""duplicate"" entry with identical information with the survey company. I thought about emailing their support and explaining that my other account had gotten banned and asking them to ""reset"" my survey account, however, I don't want to screw up my current Swagbucks account and get banned again.

Any suggestions or anyone in a similar situation?

1333831770.0,ryb1y,Townian - RTS game that can earn you money in the long run!,Wowbringer,25,9,53,"**Build an Embassy and PM oxy5 in game for invite to Reddit Alliance**

Just what the title says.  It's fairly new

Basically what you do is build houses for population and then tax them

build resource buildings for wood, food,

And build a marketplace to so you trade the resources into gold

And then Gold can be traded into real money at a ratio of:

**$1: 100 000 gold.**

If you are a premium member you can trade in ALL resources to real money

Payout for regular members is $5.
Premium members get a payout of $2.  (premium is $3/mo)

You get $1 in your balance to help kickstart your town.  You can get pretty far with this if you transfer the money into resources so you cna upgrade efficiently.  

I got all my resource buildings to about lv 6 with my dollar.  Max lv is 10

Now

I only advice to go premium once you have your first village sturdy and maybe a 2nd village study


You can also make alliances.  of course to ask for help in case of attack

Perhaps a **Narwal alliance** can be made for beermoney?  :)

SaveUp is a site that I have been visiting daily

SaveUp is a completely free rewards site that you can tie to any savings or checking account you own. When you make positive actions on these accounts, or paying off credit card debt, you are awarded credits on SaveUp. These credits can then be used to enter into sweepstakes.

It really is a totally free

You earn 200 credits for linking any accounts you own to their website, and more than enough to get you accustomed to the website. There are plenty of other ways to earn credits, you can watch videos and take (easy) quizzes on the videos, you can do challenges- little goals that you set for yourself, such as no spending or paying off debt, and you will be rewarded credits.

**Credit Spending**: Every day you can enter three times into a sweepstakes, high dollar gift cards, a website jackpot of **2 million dollars** and other very nice prizes.

Being a member, as I've only been a member for a few weeks, but I have won a good bit of credits in their sweepstakes. I fully expect to win a small amount of money in the time that I am an active member to their site, and who knows, I might hit it big and win a cash prize of $50 or more, who knows. It's fun, and if you like playing the lottery or trying your luck

Every 5 referrals grants you an extra daily play on their sweepstakes

SWTOR is down until 11 and I can't catch a nap because the city is inspecting my apartment some time between 9AM and eternity. I am a great advocate of using Superpoints for just the button because I prefer gimmicks over offers. For today

I am going to list off what I believe the better offers but obviously it won't be possible for everyone. The Netflix free offer is probably especially bad because most people have an account. If I can

First off

For Superpoints

My previous post for why you should stick with the daily clicking [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/oq1hp/superpoints_psa_for_newbies/)

Previous post of guide written to make sure you move from no ranking to Basic and so on [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/beermoney/comments/odqyp/j_p_who_i_referred_to_superpoints_and_all_other/)

Assuming Basic

DISCLAIMER: I have no way of knowing if they don't have the offer for your area. Feel free to make comments that will help out those in your area if this is the case. 

1. Netflix - 875 Points - Credit Card Required - The only issue with this one is the market is so saturated you may not be eligible. I won't go into speculation on whether or not new e-mails, I took about 20 days to watch some different things and then when the appointment in my google calendar popped, I canceled the trial. This one will require a credit card, I believe. Location: Go to PaymentWall, sort by highest paying and it will be near the top.

2. Credit Karma - 100 Points - Free - The site is a legitimately free service to keep tabs on your credit. Cons are that some people will not be a fan of ponying up personal information. The pros are that you can see reviews all over the web. For you credit nuts out there

3. Mint - 100 Points - Free -Mint is a personal finance tracker and toolset. You enter your bank account info, etc and they have all sorts of analysis you can do and it gives you a snapshot of your finances. Its free, has bank level security, and is owned by Quicken. Pretty quick and pretty legit. Location: Page 7 of the TrialPay offer wall.

Quick break for commentary. In my opinion these are the 3 best on there. This puts you are 1075 points

 4. Equifax - 840 Points - Credit Card Required - Equifax is the real deal for credit reporting. Thats because they are one of the reporting agencies. The score given by them should be your actual FICO(at least for Equifax). Why do I like Netflix and not this one? I was using my free trial of netflix everyday. If I pulled my credit report and score

Equifax's cancellation policy ""Cancellation Policy 

What is your product cancellation policy?



You may cancel your product(s) at any time.  If you purchased a subscription product that is billed monthly
 
For security reasons
 
Once you've contacted our customer care team to cancel your product

New total 1915. 585 to go.

From here

Flixter's online account and app account under new offers for TrialPay will net you 30. 

Saving Star will net you another 15 and if you use its service you make money through paypal for using coupons that you dont have to print or clip. For the sake of me not listing and researching for another hour I will let you be the judge of the nickel and dime stuff. If you have a virtual environment

 5. freecreditscore.com - 900 points -Credit Card Required - This one is pretty tricky. This is the reason I don't like offers honestly. The free trial is 7 days and then auto-subscription to that credit card you entered begins. If you are strong of will and want to run the gauntlet to cash out today this is the final boss. 
Make your account. 
Prepare your cancellation reminders. 
You will actually have to talk to a person. ""To cancel
Keep in mind their hours that they are open ""Contact us toll-free at 1-877-300-2506. 
For your convenience
Monday-Friday from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.

They are owned by Experian

If you made it through all of these then you can cash out today. You will be sitting at 2815 which mean you can cash out for a 25 dollar paypal giftcard.  The 315 remaining will keep you on your way to the next one. 

This was far more daunting a post than I had imagined. I think I'll stick to the button but if you have the will of steel you will find yourself getting paid more and more often. Always read your terms of service and set up reminders. Hopefully this helped you out in some way even if you just took advantage of the smaller point free ones.

I did put a few referrals out but won't be replenishing them once they are gone. Feel free to post below if you are close to gold or platinum and I will encourage people who read this to choose them over me.

EDIT: For some reason it changes the formatting on the numbers to a 1 when I break the list up with commentary. Equifax should read 4 and freecreditscore.com should read 5.

EDIT2: Remembered a point I wanted to make. Sometimes if you are willing to invest in some of the offers they make a profit. The key example is the purchase of a Big Fish game. It cost 2.99 and nets you 700 points. It would be the equivalent of saying I'll give you 3 dollars for 7. Its probably not a thing to do for everyone but its something to keep in mind.

But I hate that it tied my phone up, so I figured out how to use the Android emulator to run the app, so I can leave it playing, just like I do with the other videos.

First

Once you've installed that (the above link has instructions, you should navigate to the ""**tools**"" folder, and then run the file in there called ""**android**."" 

First, I only tried three of them.

Once that has downloaded and installed

Click New, but you don't seem to need to. The AVD will accept input from your computer keyboard. 

Click Create AVD

At this point

You now need to install the Adobe Flash Player (I'm not going to link to that here

    adobe flash 11 apk site:mediafire.com

Once downloaded, but I'm not going to be a huge help here. You need to run ""cmd"" from the Start&gt;Run menu, then navigate to the SDK folder. Once there, enter the platform-sdk folder, then run:
    adb devices

The output from that will show your emulated device running. Then run:
    adb install nameoffile.apk

where nameoffile.apk is the Flash you just downloaded.

Next find and download the apk of the Swagbucks TV app. I found one here:[ http://www.mediafire.com/?17rmfiubkpug8ku](http://www.mediafire.com/?17rmfiubkpug8ku)

Copy that to the platform-tools folder as well

That's it! Go to the emulator window, of course, but that's all there is to it.

I was a little annoyed with the SDK when I first set it up, and I will do my best to help out.

It should get you about 10 bucks a week for only a few (less than 10) minutes a day.

**Locket (Android only)**  [NonRef](http://getlocket.com)

This is basically selling the space on your lock screen for ads. You 
should make between 25 and 50 cents a day just from unlocking your phone

**Bing Rewards** [NonRef](http://www.bing.com/rewards/signup/webtou)
Microsoft will pay you to search on their website
approximately 1 cent per two searches, you are probably searching the internet anyhow, so there is a chrome extension will let you use Google and get points for bing. No link for that, because it's kind of cheating. For truly dirty pool, you can use a bot to generate the searches, but that seems like a good way to get banned and lose your ability to earn entirely. You can make about 15-20 cents a day here, depending on how many searches they will count per day.

**Cash N Hits** [NonRef](http://www.cashnhits.com/index.php)

The trick here is to use their auto-browse feature to get 20 cents or so per day, so that the videos you auto-surf don't trigger. Note that some of the videos will somehow start up anyways (any idea why, guys?), so if one does come up, set the volume to mute and the next one will load unobtrusively.

**Digital Generation** [NonRef](https://coingeneration.com/auth/new/)

This one requires you to download a program, the Illuminati or someone. Once you verify with a phone number, you can download a program with a ""trial thread"" that will get you a dollar a day to run it. At the 30 day mark, your thread will expire, and you can either cash out or pay them 20 bucks to keep going. If you do decided to keep going, just let your thread sit for up to a year.

So

* Locket         :     25 cents/day (2 unlocks an hour/12 hours)
* Bing Rewards   :  15 cents/day (minimum # of searches 30)
* Cash n Hits    :    20 cents/day (baseline
* Digital Generation: 100 cents/day (leaving on)
* Total:  160 cents/day= $11.20 a week. 

Note that at the end of four weeks, as it were.Thanks, and happy earning!

**Step 1 - Sign up for an account**

[Referral](http://yardsellr.com/photons?pap=1989050)      and [Non](http://yardsellr.com/)
You are free to choose either link, this is not for you. Also US only.)

**Step 2 - Earn Your Rewards**

-Yardsellr rewards are called Photons. Photons are valued at 100

-Make sure you Photon balance is not going down by watching the last digit. This a very important step. In order to get you to come back to the site everyday

-There are several ways to earn Photons. For example, you'll be a smaller menu that says ""Stuff you love / People / Blocks"". Click on Blocks. This will organize the page into blocks, or categories. Before you can put something into a block, you have like 'Follow' that block. You should see the page is now organized into blocks. Hover over each of the block and 'Follow' it. Do this for as many blocks as you can stand. Once you have followed a shitload of blocks, mouse-over your name in the top right corner and go to my account. Towards the right you will see your 'Stats', which includes your blockify score. Click on 'Latest Listings'. This will display the most recent items that have been listed and have not been put into a block. Mouse-over these items and click the white plus sign. This will bring up the block menu. You should be able to figure it out from there. Once an item is put into the same block by enough people you will be rewarded, so don't spend too much time searching for an esoteric block. Hit the common stuff like clothes and jewelry. The Photons are not rewarded immediately. They are usually rewarded in block of 2500

**Earning Larger Amounts of Photons**

-There are other ways to earn Photons besides blockifying,000 per sign up, and 500,000 if they buy or sell (which is very possible -- we'll get to that later.)

-The Offer Wall is the giant, or taking surveys. This is also very important to making some decent cash, but you MUST use their offers strategically. Do not sign up for anything yet. I will tell you how to do that a little later.

-The Photon Wheel is the most fun part of this, and have gotten every prize. My average spin has been worth around $1.90. I think this number is pretty close, but maybe slightly on the high side because I did get the $50 once. I will tell you the best way to get spins and when to use them a little later. 

-The Daily Leaderboard is also a way to earn some decent cash. They award daily prizes for Buyers (which is really just total Photons earned as far as I can tell), but you can easily slip into the Top 10, which usually pays $10. This is why you want to be strategic about when you accumulate Photons. 

-There are also Photons races

**How my systems typically works**

-Now that you understand the basics of how to earn Photons I can tell you how to do that most efficiently and how to convert your Photons into value outside of the site.

-First thing to keep in mind: The smaller Photon rewards for blockifying, etc are capped at 1M / per day. The other rewards such as referrals and Photon Wheel spins are not capped. This means you should blockify first before earning anything else. If you hit your 1M through blockifying, you can continue to earn more Photons through offers, referrals, and spins, but the converse is not true. There is not limit on Photons from these sources, but once you have passed 1M in daily earnings you will be blockifying for free. 

-The key to my success was the Photon Spins. You want to wait on utilizing the Offer Wall until you have a good day with spins. This means you have to acquire spins. Sometimes random people will send you a spin. If this happens, so bear with me. Yardsellr does not charge a fee to list your item, but they charge a 'slice' which has a minimum of $2.95. Sellers can choose who pays the slice (buyer or seller). There is also shipping and handling to consider. People offer spins to entice people to buy. Some people know what they are doing and only offer 1 or 2 spins. Some people are new to selling (you have to purchase spins as a seller) and offer WAY too many spins per item. These are the people you want to find. You can use your Photon balance to purchase these items, but the slice has to be paid with real money. You can choose to 1) Find someone who offers spins on an item and they pay the slice and S&amp;H. This is actually very common. 2) Find someone who covers the slice and you pay S&amp;H or 3) My favorite method: Find someone with a low-priced item who offers local pickup. You want to look for at least 5 spins on a low-priced item. That way you can cover the item with your Photons, select local pick-up, which is free obv, and you may have to pay the slice of $2.95. I spent about $20 to get up to $300 plus, you can email the seller and tell them you don't really want the item and that they can keep it if they send you a few spins in exchange. This usually only works with sellers that have local pickup because Yardsellr holds the funds with new sellers until they provide the site with a tracking number. 

-Once you have a few spins built up, use your spins on the wheel. I like to save up 7 - 10 spins. The amount of Photons you win will determine what's next. If you end up with 6M+ Photons ($60) - STOP. This should be enough to get Top 10. If you have a more average day, say 1.5M - 3M, this is when you want to take advantage of the offer wall. There are several options on there that pay 1M -3M, as well as a bunch in the 500k range. Stack these offers (make sure you choose the ones that verify instantly) until you get into that 5.5M - 6M range). The contest ends at midnight EST, so you can keep an eye on your position. If you have a few spins left you can be more conservative with the Offer Wall and monitoring the Leaderboard until 11:30 PM to see where you stand. Make the Top 10 and you automatically get $10 in Photons in your account. 

*Regarding real money

-You can pretty easily figure out if it is worth spending real money to get spins. You have my ballpark for what a spin is worth, or resell on Yardsellr or another site. This will make Photons worth about $0.50 on the dollar. Of course, you want to find items where you don't have to pay the slice or S&amp;H, which further dilutes your Photon/dollar value. I prefer to buy gift cards. There are many sellers now who sell Amazon and other GCs with no slice and free S&amp;H. I just bought two $100 Amazon GCs for $120 a piece, which is $0.83 on the dollar. Keep in mind that after the slice, these people are making about $8 per GC, which they don't even purchase until after you buy it from them. After you complete the order, buy the GC and have it shipped to your address. 

**That's the basics of it**

I'm sure I have left something out

With that out of the way

Beer Money tip #1 (or **BMT#1**): Fall is here, something like $5-$10 depending on how big the area is, maybe a little more if they want you to rake the leaves into trash bags or something. If not, on the curb is fine too. **BE COURTEOUS AND NICE!**

**BMT #2**: Notice any places where people don't recycle their cans or bottles? Pick them up and collect them! Pay rates vary from state to state, the natural price of a 6 pack of average beer....or if you enjoy the taste of a good premium ale, its halfway there!

**BMT#3**: Are you in school/college right now? Are you good at a particular subject(s) that tend to be tough fro others? Offer your time and services as a tutor! Create a post on Craigslist and list what subject you are good at and mention you can offer help for a price. I have a friend who is really good with calculus and statistics and helped quite a bit of people through word of mouth and made quite a bit of money over a semester....enough to buy a new PS3 and 5 games.  Best time to do this----during any midterms/finals.

**BMT#4:** [ebay](http://www.ebay.com/)--- Have any stuff laying around the house you think might be worth something? Search for anything you think may be relevant on the site to gauge what it sells for. For example

Another thing is Craigslist, you can sell to ANYONE.

So see that old set of silverware your mom gave you? Is it in nice condition and not a cheap knock off? See what its selling for and list that puppy!

1334890848.0,sizw3,(re)Launch. Datsoup.,mrfrasha,18,3,12,"TL;DR **[WWW.DATSOUP.COM](http://datsoup.com/)**

Hey guys. Some of you saw my post a couple days ago about datsoup.com and well it wasn't ready yet at that point however now I think it's ready to operate. For those of you that didn't see the post datsoup is the ""mod"" version of the refer-o-matic. There are 3 main difference between datsoup and the refer o matic.

First. The referral ID's are kept in the database for 30 days. Not a week. Hopefully this makes it easier for your ref ID's to get chosen and to have someone sign up with it.

Second. The design/description of the sites. While neither of the two are exceptional they provide a bit more of a user friendly site where someone who has no idea of what the program is can get an idea and then decide if they want to sign up. Obviously the descriptions of the sites/the design of datsoup needs to get better but as for right now they will suffice. 

Last. The domain name. Whether or not you actually like the name datsoup or think it fits the site (supposed to be ""put you referral ID's in dat soup) it's at least easy to remember and can be posted about on forums and talked about in real life with little confusion which can lead to more people using it to sign up with your referral links. 

Past that they are pretty much exactly the same. If you have any suggestions feel free to comment below or send me a suggestion through the ""Contact Us"" button on the nav bar. 

Also please be patient with any changes that need to be made. I'll do my very best with anything that you want to see implemented but it might take some time.

Most of the jobs were really time consuming and it took forever to make any worthwhile sum of money. Then one day I found a test from Midwest Internet (I think that was their previous time) for a Internet Writing Qualification Test. It was two dollars and I would get a four dollar bonus for doing well on it so I said what the hell. I took the test and got the bonus.

Turns out this company was posting a plethora of jobs everyday. Anywhere from writing how-to articles to reference articles. They eventually changed their name to CrowdSource and have even more work than they used to. For writing 100-300 word articles you get anywhere from 2-6 dollars a piece and it is pretty easy work.  

They do the qualification process a bit differently now. Make an mturk account and then go to www.write.com and read the FAQ and take the test to become a paid writer. You will want to send them your mturk worker ID as well which can be found under the ""Your Account"" tab. It might be good to do a few unrelated HITS first before taking the test so you can establish some worker history. Some of the jobs also require that you have completed a certain amount of HITs beforehand. I make anywhere from 1-2k extra  month for just a couple of extra hours of work everyday.

Clickworker has writing assignments at a rate of on average 1 dollar per 100 words or more. This site is great if you are quick at writing SEO text.

 Assignments include writing SEO text for groupon, but grow boring after a while because of their similarity. As well, there are often no tasks available. You will have to do some basic tests to get access to assignments, and I have heard that there are more available for bilingual workers.

Mturk
