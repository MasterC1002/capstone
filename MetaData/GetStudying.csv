During the middle of class she was quizzing us on a few chapters in preparation for an upcoming test. She then gets to one middle aged woman and asks her a question to answer. The woman kinda freezes up a bit, but she just cannot for the life of her remember it. After a while, our professor suddenly starts mimicking the Jeopardy theme, I guess to break the tension and give everyone a bit of a laugh. This is what happened when she started doing that. 

Student: Haha. Stop that

Professor: So? What does being nervous have to do with anything?

Student: Well I can't remember it as well if I'm nervous.

Professor: Oh really? Well tell me this. If you were walking down a dark ally one night

Student: Well of course I could.

Professor: Oh really? But wouldn't you be nervous in that situation?

Student: Haha. Yeah but I know my own name!

Professor: Exactly!! You would *know* your name

Now, that what I did. I studied to know. Not to remember. And on the next test I made a 97. Up until that point I was in the low 80's. During the next semester I had 4 classes including a physics class. All my life I had always struggled terribly with anything related to science, but this time I was gonna prove to myself that I could actually do it. And I did. An A in physics, along with an A in each of the others except for one (fuck literature). The semester after that I had biology, my academical arch enemy. But again I was gonna prove I could do it. 

Never made below a 95 on a single test. Fuck yeah you guys. Fuck yeah. Never felt more like a boss than when I made biology my bitch. 

So there it is. Hope it helps you because it sure as hell helped me more than I could have hoped for

1365368996.0,1bvh0l,Is it really laziness?,tetrabrach,156,13,24,"**tl;dr**

**1. In many cases people are anxious

**2. Set clear goals you can actually attain

**3. Don't waste mental energy judging yourself or comparing yourself to others. You have too many important things on your plate to waste time with that.**

**4. Study however you need to; don't be afraid to experiment with different methods. Listening to a book isn't somehow less valid than reading it.**

**5. Make sure you have all the supplies and stuff you need so that when you start working you don't have to waste focus on looking for things.**

**Whole Thing:**

Very, laziness, or an inability to get started is actually some degree of anxiety and/or perfectionism.

If you're aware of the fact that you needed to be doing $THING, given your dog a bath, played 12 hours of Skyrim, sharpened all your pencils, *and* alphabetized your DVDs, the problem is **not** with you. A little voice, so quiet your conscious mind isn't aware of it

The best way around this is to avoid adding negative value judgments to your studying, study for two minutes- but actually study. If you're at your desk for an hour, but 45 minutes of it is spent thinking about how you're stupid and lazy for not starting sooner, that's both unproductive and unhelpful. You're training yourself to associate study with stress.

Let yourself need what you need. Set up your study space so that you have what you need: notebooks, eraser, calculator, whatever. Just have your supplies easily accessible. Keep a spare cable in your bag for your mp3 player if you need background music. Have some spare batteries for your calculator. If you can't study in a library, go to a coffee shop. Work in your car. Read in a park. Listen to audiobooks at the gym if that's what works for you. No one method is better than another- all that matters is getting information in your brain.

Most importantly, do half of your calculus problem set, read three chapters of your English novel, and review your physics notes, you can accomplish quite a lot. Maybe it will take you three hours; maybe it will take you two. Maybe five. Maybe you'll get tired and need to stop, but you'll have finished your calculus and physics goals. If you can't see clear progress, you'll never appreciate the effort you've put in. That kind of negative feedback is not going to make it any easier to come back.

Studying should be engaging and will often be *challenging*, chastising yourself, and staring blankly at a textbook, you will find that your time is much more productive.

Lastly, talking about how he spent the last two days awake and studying. Maybe you are that guy. Don't be that guy. Don't listen to that guy. Methods don't matter- results matter. Eating right, working out, and getting enough sleep will let you get more done in six hours than That Guy did in 48- plus your adrenal glands won't be shot to hell.

I came up with a total of 111~ hours to prepare. Quite a lot hmm? I can easily afford to be a little inefficient with my time.


I went ahead and timed myself doing one 'study block'

This is when I made my horrific discovery...

It's been 6 days since I started this. Every time I'd 'study'
Any time I looked at facebook, and restarted it when I got back to the books.

What I found horrified me.

For the first 6 days

That's right, it FELT because I was sitting in front of the books/computer etc that I was studying rather 'hard'.

Where the rest of that time went I honestly have no idea. The next step in my little self study, and next to each time write down what was done. eg 3.43minutes -toilet, just to see where this time is infact going.

I'd like to both ask and recommend some other people on this sub to do this

Perhaps we could even make a bit of a game with this

Supposed to be a basic guide to strolling the fuck over to your desk and picking up a goddamn highlighter. Suggestions and edits are welcome and encouraged! 

Easy advice to give

**Plan**

* Break up all the work into the tiniest components and list them out. (e.g.

* Estimate how much time it will *realistically* take to complete each task. Write it down.

* Plan in advance and assign a number of those little components to each day

* Find a pomodoro timer website that works for you

* If you need flashcards

* Grab some pledge wipes and make your work station sparkle like a fucking unicorn on LSD. Line up fresh notebooks, favorite pens, new highlighters, big cold glass of water (+ reliable coaster), and anything you'll need to do your work

* If you're working on several things keep your backpack on the floor next to you and only pull out relevant material for what you're currently working on

**Start**

* Use pomodoro to keep yourself on track and most focused.

* Sit down and do it. Cell phone away

* Because everything should be broken up into manageable pieces

* If its reading

* If you're writing

* If you're studying, whatever works as long as you're pulling it back out from your brain. This will save you time!

**Keep Going**

* Go to class. Go to the gym. Make dinner. As long as you're on track with your study schedule

* Little by little

1355777742.0,150fww,Tips for Good Grades,B33P3R,105,19,18,"I wrote this ""checklist"" for my girlfriend who was having trouble academically. I made it a bit more formal


**Tips for Successful Studying/Good Grades**

1.	**Study Alone**: Studying with friends is only going to be a distraction. Goofing off is bound to occur, then do it! The exception to this rule is to rehearse information with someone else, AFTER you have studied it. Have them test you with flash cards or with a sheet of your notes. If it is math you are having trouble with, you may want to look that over with a friend as well, but be weary of goofing off.

2.    **Study in Advance:** Make sure you study within a week or two of your test (depending on how difficult the material is)

3.	**Practice Grammar/Spelling**: When texting people or typing on Facebook, email, etc. DO NOT abbreviate with sentences like “were r u goin.” Use proper punctuation, capitalize the right letters, and make sure your word usage is correct (Know the difference between “your,” and “you’re,” “its” and “It’s, and people notice and point it out.

4.	**Don’t Lie to Yourself**: Don’t say you’ve studied for something more than you have. If you get a bad grade, your grade would have been better than it was. Of course it isn’t always 100% your fault for a bad grade (hard test questions, etc.), but take responsibility for not doing well. This will make you want to try harder next time, and will discourage laziness.

5.	**Visit Office Hours:** Even if it’s just once

6.	**Don’t Get Too Involved**: Joining clubs and getting involved on campus is all great, the last thing you should be looking into is an organization to join. Organizations can wait, but your grades come at a scheduled time at the end of every semester, and those matter much more. 

7.	**Be Independent:** Don’t count on friends for happiness. Learn to enjoy alone time

8.	**Use a Computer to Take Notes**: If the professor says no computers, every class, and every test. Arrange them accordingly. This makes it very easy to take notes and find notes. Save your notes by the Class, and the Date. If your class is History 116 and it is December 10th, save your notes as HIS116 Notes 12.10.12 (Microsoft word cannot save documents with “/” in them, so use periods to separate the date). *(This doesn't work best for everyone, but it's great for keeping organized. If you already know that pen and paper works best for you, maybe give this a try.)* 

9.	**Review Notes After Class**: A lot of times it’s easy to write something down

10.   **Meditate!** : Take 5 minutes or more a day to just sit down quietly alone

BEFORE STUDYING:

**1) MOTIVATION:**

* Browse various studying forums while drinking black coffee to psych myself up for studying. ( I do that only prior a long study session).

* Sometimes when I dont feel like studying


**2) PREPARATION:**

* I prepare my study playlist,  It *DOES* make a difference. I can easily sit for two hours in a row listening to this music and study without getting bored. I recommend everyone to order hemi-sync CD's and listen to them while studying. 
* I prepare my book and all my notes and bring alot of blank print paper. I don't like the ruled paper for some reason. I like writing my notes on a blank white paper. 
* For long study sessions (4 hours +) , Redbulls. Redbulls and caffeine drinks are limited to one drink every three hours. 

**3) ACTUAL STUDY SESSION:**

* I study with headphones on while listening to hemi-sync music. My study technique relies heavily on taking notes from my own previous notes and the book. Light use of mind maps. If I open the book and I feel lost

* I try to avoid just reviewing a subject. I find *simply* reading a book without actively taking notes or writing down the important points or at least highlighting important parts as a waste of time. 

*  Through experimentation I found out that I am alot more productive using the pomodoro method. I study for four pomodoros (Each pomodoro is 25 minutes)  then take a long break then come back again for four pomodoros. This way I can study for long periods using short concentrated bursts. I finish alot this way than if I study 2 hours in a row. It also limits my distractions.

* In every long break

Update: Reddit can sometime be like counseling. Now seeking help from the university and about to go and talk to my girlfriend about this. Thanks for the advice and support everyone!

Update 2: Told my girlfriend first: She was shocked because I told her at a store. We talked after wards and told me that she was upset that I didnt tell her that I was struggling through classes, but to make better choices and try to do things better and to internships along the way because I haven't done any. She was supportive. 

I told my brother second: He was extremely supportive. He graduated before and just wanted to get out of college and just breezed through school. He said to stay calm and that I am not a failure because I had not quit yet. I told him I want to give it another shot and do it right. He said to take my time and come back strong

My PARENTS! I told my father first, and hopefully I will fix it because I was not doing so well on my last classes.

I read on here a while back that one thing that helped others to stop procrastinating was a change in venue. Your old studying place might carry feelings of procrastination and goofing off so a new place was kind of a fresh start, or even your kitchen. Well I took that to a different level. 

I have my own laptop that I built and love, MS Office, iTunes, WoW, Reddit as my homepage, all the bookmarks of every great thing I have ever found on the internet, and Mila Kunis on the background. Its so easy for me to procrastinate with it all there. The second user is my change of venue. 

My second user is now basically my work user, [StayFocused](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stayfocusd/laankejkbhbdhmipfmgcngdelahlfoji) which can and does block every single fun website I ad. There is even an option that makes you complete a difficult task to get to be able to change the rules and guidelines you have set. So on this second user, I have all but forgotten about Reddit, my lvl 90 hunter, and my ex's Facebook profile.... (thank you god..)

So I came here to advocate making a second user on your computer and blocking all your fun shit. That way you can figuratively have your cake and eat it too.

Firstly, sometimes a few hours before the test, and for the exams I didn't even bother to study for most of them even before the day of the test - this is the level of my laziness. Despite that I managed to achieve a good enough score to get into Chemical Engineering here in Australia (which I believe I don't deserve as I am a piece of lazy piece of shit)

However. I'm failing all of my subjects. The issue is not with partying, as I don't even work. The issue with chronic procrastination and deep laziness. I spend all of my free-time on the internet on Facebook, Reddit and reading blog posts and articles instead of studying and leave everything to the very last minute for assignments and sometimes for exams I don't even bother to study at all.

I just can't seem to do my work

However I don't want to be a piece of shit lazy procrastinator anymore. I've been trying to change everyday for the past four months.. but to no avail. Every day before I go to sleep I say 'Tomorrow is the day I'm going to change' but alas nothing happens. I feel like shit all day because I'm a disappointment to myself and my parents who have been really supportive and caring towards me.

I deserve to fail because it is my fault. I don't deserve to be studying at a university. I may have been smart enough to get into university by doing the absolute bare minimum but that's not fair to all the other people who worked hard and deserved to be in my place but didn't get in. It's a sad fact that people like me who don't put in the effort and who don't want it bad enough are allowed to study.

So I've decided that I'm going to take a year of from university, possibly volunteer and then come back, if I feel I have changed my ways then I will perhaps continue with tertiary study otherwise. But I need advice on whether this is a suitable plan of action. So feedback would be appreciated.

Also any advice on how I overcome the mess I am in?

1363480977.0,1afsul,A guide to efficient memorisation.,IIIZhouYu,51,4,7,"Hello everyone

I thought I'd share what I know about memorisation with you guys

Why you should read this: memorisation gets a bad wrap

I'm not claiming to be a memory genius by any means
****

**Preamble**

Right,423 you will probably repeat it to yourself in your head to try and get it to stick. This is sub optimal. 

Human memory is good at a couple of things

* Visual images (note that memorisation of images and recreation are two different skills)
* Emotions
* Physical spaces

Sitting here right now you will probably be able to remember how to walk from where you lived as a kid to your friend's house, and something we don't recognise every day. Likewise, you will probably be able to remember the faces of people you haven't seen in years (though again, describing that face to someone else is a different skill), or the cover of a favourite book, or a time where you have been really angry/upset/happy.

Humans are good at this stuff, analysis of literature, case names, etc.

The trick to efficient memorisation is essentially use the memorisation techniques we are naturally good at to remember the stuff we suck at remembering normally. Basically
****

**Memorising specific pieces of information**

The way to get anything to stick in your head is to make it interesting, which is a criminal case about taking your victim as you find them. 

To memorise R v McKechnie I make a basic visual image of the associations that the case name brings to mind - personally its a guy in a tartan kilt (Mc) getting stabbed in the knee (nie) which then explodes - the guy in the case had an ulcer which exploded meaning he couldn't get surgical treatment. He also wears a crown (R = Regina).

This is the core of efficient memorisation - take something that you need to remember and make it really memorable

How well this works does depend to some extent on the information you are trying to remember - R v McKechnie is a lot easier to create associations for than 1, you can perform a similar trick with numbers - you just have to codify them to visual images. So 1 becomes a tree, 8 becomes a snake, 6 becomes a devil, etc. I won't go into detail on number memorisation, because frankly I don't use it overmuch and other people can do it better. However, if you ever wanted to know how to memorise a deck of cards, thats how you do it - a common technique is the [PAO system](http://mnemotechnics.org/wiki/Person-Action-Object_%28PAO%29_System).

****
**Efficient recall**

Being able to make a great visual image for something will innately make it easier to remember, but won't know where to look.

However

The journey method works like this - you recall a journey that you know from your memory - say how to get from your bedroom to your bathroom to your kitchen to the front door (or whatever). A journey can be anything from the inside of your house, streets in a city, etc.

So

****
**Putting it into practice**

This is great in theory

Socks, sink, diamond, waterbottle, beyonce, asparagus, desk, aftershave, cat, arrow

Try and memorise these now

Maybe you are a memory genius

Now, amusing mental images you can for each of the above items in the list. Then you place the items from that list in each of the 'stops' on your memory journey. So for instance, in my memory journey there are socks floating in the air above my bed. They stink and have gone slightly green, they are my slightly expensive thousand-mile running socks and if I go close to them they drag over my face making me feel gross. Suddenly, socks are memorable. 

Go through your memory journey making each item as memorable as possible with as many associations as you can - you can use vulgarity (there are an alarming quantity of giant cocks in my law journeys), colour, sound and (possibly strongest) personal connections. Then place each item in a specific point in your memory journey - so I have my socks floating over my bed, then a big red silk cushion on my desk, etc. 

Take your time and really focus on it. Part of the reason why the memory technique is so effective is because it makes you focus on what you are trying to memorise.

Now, then focus on making those images as vibrant as possible and being really emphatic in how you place them.

Now, you should be able to tell me that it was Beyonce without any real difficulty. Moreover, you could tell me the list backwards, or tell me the third item from the end, just by walking through your memory journey. Cool shit huh?

****
**How to apply this to studying**

This of course depends heavily upon what you study and how you study. Some topics don't require memorisation, your mileage may vary.

However

Again

Personally I use visual imagery to recall case names, and walks along a nearby road where I have positioned visual images of cases like 'Van Gend en Loos' or Simmenthal. 

Using the journey method you can memorise an entire overview of a topic

I placed that cheat-sheet along a road near my house

Essentially

As I mentioned, the trade-off is that, if you spend the time memorising the journey you can perfectly recall the information you require. 

Revision then becomes an active process where you organise your information

I have personally found that the journey method makes revision less shitty and boring. Instead of rereading textbooks (don't do that)
****

**Wrapping it up**

Please forgive me for a wall of text that probably doesn't read too well. I've tried to summarise quite a complicated technique in a pretty short space, but that I am just trying to share something I have found useful with other people who might find it useful.

Good luck memorising :).
****

**Further information**

The book that got me started on efficient memorisation and the journey technique was 'Moonwalking With Einstein' by Joshua Foer. Its an excellent (and very well written and engaging) overview of memorisation and the journey technique. My 'putting it into practice' section is pretty much yanked wholesale from the (much better) bit in this book. 

I have also read 'You can have an amazing memory' by Dominic O'Brien

1366389784.0,1comds,A late semester self-assessment: What I've learned.,Wiskie,48,6,6,"Hey all

I noticed I was slacking lately so I figure I could remotivate myself and others by returning to [a post I made earlier in the semester](http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/16yz2p/what_are_some_of_the_things_you_guys_are_doing/c80oecm). If you're like me
 
Let's start by just going down the list:

* I was surprisingly good at getting things done early last semester

I think my problem here was an issue of not bringing the intensity everday

* Always go to office hours whenever they don't overlap with a class. The professor/TA is giving you the opportunity to learn in a more personal environment

I've been better about asking professors and TAs questions and I feel that this has made a difference. They are surprisingly willing to take the time to explain it to you thoroughly if you take the time to ask. Don't neglect the possibility of email (especially for TAs who aren't quite so busy as profs).

* ALWAYS, but when it is, take it. In fact, it shouldn't even be seen as auxiliary, it should be considered part of the grade.

So far

* Read the book. Even if it's not required reading/bears little resemblance to the lectures/notes

This has been a game changer. Your lectures are probably around an hour or less in length. You **will not** get everything you want/need to learn out of a class without reading the complementary textbook at least once and keeping up with it (generally best to read it *before* the corresponding lecture if you can't do before *and* after). 

* Get to bed at a reasonable hour.

I've been getting worse at this as the semester goes on. The temptation to go on reddit is sometimes just too great. The problem, say, 8am, the alarm goes off, and yet... I'm not getting out of bed until 9:30 sometimes. That *sucks* when you planned on doing something at 8:15 and cannot.

* Get into a routine. One thing I'm thinking about: Making sure everything I do has a purpose. That purpose can be ""relaxation"", but I need to be allotting my time in such a way that everything makes sense. There should be a rhythm to my life, and there should be enough going on to make sure that even if one thing stresses me out, there are positives. Work towards goals.

I'm telling you, and furthermore, every second of time I spent doing something was to serve a purpose--very calculated. I would recommend this if you can do it.

**Other Stuff I've Learned:**

* You really should be attending all your class periods. If there's one thing I am proud to say I have done and will do consistently, it kills your motivation.

* Going back to my previous point about finding a rhythm
 
1. I'm a quiet guy, for example), but I think the biggest thing I've learned is that you have to be an initiator. You need to be the one that brings people together more than you need to be the one who gets invited to everything. Food for thought, probably better to go to /r/seduction or /r/socialskills if you want more on that. Not much I can do this semester, but I've already gotten in contact with some old friends over the summer so I can hopefully keep my self busy... and entertained.

2. Making the distinction between setting aside time for relaxation and ""wasting time"" is an important one. I need to listen to my own advice here a little more. It's an important point. Make your free time count. Make it enjoyable so that it legitimately recharges you.

3. Bring the intensity from the start. It's much easier to start strong (and you'll tend to finish a little easier due to burnout anyway) than to start slow and try to catch up. Be a little fanatical for the first few weeks and you'll surprise yourself with how good off you are by mid-semester.

4. Don't freak out. Self-explanatory. Take action. Look up [internal locus of control](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locus_of_control). **YOU** are responsible for making things happen in your life. It injures you to see it in any other light. It's frustrating to be working all the time, and don't live in the past or future.

* I allow myself one ""fun class"" a semester. Last semester was a programming class through the CS department. This semester was a German history class through foreign language. Every STEM major (male or female) should reward themselves with a class through the foreign language department. The ""scenery"" is *so* much better than what I had gotten used to in the Computer Science department

1355015883.0,14ix8u,Seven Strategies to Increase your Study Motivation,Spudst3r,46,7,5,"Reddit I took a class on learning strategies in University.  Since motivation is probably the biggest challenge facing people on r/GetStudying

Here they are:

**1.  Use Self-Consequencing**

Use self-administered reinforcements and consequences for meeting goals for a task 

For example: *If I create an outline organizing my thesis this afternoon



**2. Use Performance or Mastery Self-Talk**

Use thoughts or self-talk to remind and rehearse reasons for why you should do or persist in a task 

Examples:  
""I am really starting to get this""

""If I answer all the study questions in my text

""If I answer the study questions



**3. Increase your Interest**

Remind yourself of the value in persisting or completing a task and finding ways to increase immediate enjoyment or situational interest in the task.

For example:  Talk to somebody who really enjoys the task to find out what they like about it 



**4. Change your Environment**

Manage the resources and the environment around you to decrease off-task behaviour.

For example



**5. Efficacy Management**

Deliberately attempt to increase your confidence in your ability to be successful studying or doing a task.

For example



**6. Use Proximal Goal Setting**

Break tasks into smaller units that are easier to manage. 

For example: 
Instead of setting a goal that says... *Study Chapter 3 for my exam.*

Try… *Identify and define key terms in Chapter 3 that have a good chance of being on the exam.*



**7. Use Attribution Control**

Deliberately attribute the causes of your successes and failures to  things that are… 

- In your control 
- Changeable 

For example:  Instead of thinking…  *I didn’t do well because I’m not good at math.*

Try… *I didn’t do well because I didn’t practice answering that type of question.*

1369609324.0,1f3t0v,"xpost r/getdisciplined: Exam advice for undergraduates, for those studying for a-levels, GCSE's etc cut out the extra reading",,42,9

I've just done two very tough exams

The two modules were very different and required a lot of learning, we were supposed to do essays on the topics, include extra reading and show, in short that we understood the topics. I think that a good method for learning for this style of exam may be important to many on r/getdisciplined. So here's my advice.

My style of learning was to prepare answers that would do well and then learn those. Below are my tips for 1. creating the answers

**1. Answer creation:**

**1a**. *Speak to your colleagues.* Class mates are best and speak to more than one. Once you find out what everyone else is doing you will realise that one

**1b**. *Go through the lecture notes.* Your lecture notes are meant to guide you

**1c**. *Question spotting.* Find which questions have come up before. Write down all of these questions and ADD any questions of a similar style that could occur from your lecture notes. When adding questions make sure to be as broad as possible within the framework the lecturer has provided. Look at exercise questions that have been set by your lecturer and compare these to previous exam questions

**1d**. *Read around the topic.* To get a good answer for your topic you need to show some extra reading. This may come in the form of academic journals or books/online resources. When reading academic journals focus on the abstract

**1e**. Plan for each possible question within allocated time* Following from 1c: exams have a set layout that a lecturer will tell you before it comes up. Work out how long you have for each section then.

**1f**. **Structure.** *Structure* This is to be combined with your planning. Each essay should have a structure and one that you can relate to quickly. Being dyslexic I find this tough to do. My method is to initially brainstorm points and then, I had to write a literature review on a certain topic. I brainstormed all papers that I could think of and some important points. I then wrote the papers in chronological order, this made sense as each built on the next though an order which works for your essay is what you desire. I then came up with the recurrent METHOD, FINDINGS, WEAKNESSES/ANALYSIS way of breaking each paper down. 
Now this method must change slightly when you don’t know what question will come up. It is key here to make your answer flexible enough to cut out waffle when asked a specific question. For instance: say I had a question explain the Economics of Labour demand

**1g. Colour**
I think this is the most important thing I could recommend along with timing. Buy 10 felt tip pens all of different colours and a stack of A3 (it’l be the best money you spend). Make sure you have bright visible colours that are distinguishable from each other and black.
Now say you have 4 topics to learn, orange = 3 brown =4. On top of that I use Green as difficult to remember, pink as vital, and Black (and black only for this) as the journal author and year of publication. I then construct my answers in their major colour, but bracket each title, sub title in a green cloud and extend a line from it to the bottom of that subsection (then repeat cloud). Big subsections have a big green square and prongs on the outer side of them. I can see nearly all of my notes when I’m in an exam through this method of learning.
If you have graphs then draw the graph axis in its section’s colour. 
Also, as is the persistence change section.


**2. Learning answers:**

**2a**. *Timed Answer* Firstly write your answer using the same equipment you’d use in your exam but looking at your coloured notes whilst timing the answer with a stopwatch. You’ll see very quickly whether you need to cut things or not. If you do need to cut things do so

**2b**. *Record answer* on your phone or on a recording device record yourself

**2c**. *Re-write answer 5 times* The first time you do this look at your notes for 10mins before
For number 4

**2d** *Difficulty with a specific point* If you cannot remember something then use the **look say cover write check technique**. Do it in that order and repeat until you get it

----------------------------
And that should be enough. I’ve found that with the above


I hope some of it is useful.

TL;DR
Read the italics and look at what you think is appropriate for you. Focus on **communicating with others

Edit: Final point, but always remember any 'I can't do it' attitude is never 100% correct. To relieve stress I cut caffeine from my diet completely, even green tea. I meditated for 15-30mins every morning see here: http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1835/ and I always ate decent quality food (cut anything that would spike my day but end in a low ie fast food).

1358999346.0,17644k,[19 Right Now] Been 2 years since I've stepped foot in school. 2010 I dropped out. Got my GED last year and am starting Freshman year in College next Monday.,getmymindready,44,7,14,"I was never a great student

I still managed to get into the city's best Junior H.S (Intermediate) because I took their art entrance exam and got accepted (You had a choice to either take the math or art talent exams). From my freshman to senior year I failed most of my classes (I got a 55 EVERY single semester in Italian every year, Science. The only class I've gotten A+ in was gym. I never got held back because I cheated my way through tests, forged my parent's signatures and copied homeworks from my peers. I was ridiculed by my classmates for doing this, this was no surprised because they were all kids that lived in wealthy homes and played all sorts of instrument (I knew some to this day that went to Yale or Harvard.)

I left Junior High and went to the High School near my home. It was horrible and I had to step through metal detectors everyday because the school officers had a couple incidents where kids would bring knives and guns inside. The constant smell of weed lingered in the hallways and the teachers seemed helpless in making the students turn their lives around. I was one of these kids. The pure lack of educational reinforcement within the high school caused to me find solace by cutting class and heading home to play games on my PC instead. I'd soon buy a copy of World of Warcraft and every time a raid or event would come up I'd leave school in the middle of the day. Eventually the counselor saw this and told me to get a GED

I dropped out in late 2010 and started working full time in retail. Last year I got really interested in nursing because of my friends. I've known them since middle school and they are all going to great ivy league universities through out the country. They tried to put me back in school by convincing me to get my GED which I received July of last year. I recently switched to a part time job and am staying with one my friends who goes to a nearby university splitting rent in other to attend Community College classes.   

My Community College counselor put in English Composition

I need to get my mind ready for this because it's the only chance I have to get an education again. I've been actively reading books for the last year trying to keep my grammar and english intact so that's a start I guess. Any past experiences in any Nursing education would be greatly appreciated.

1365300264.0,1btwvv,Advice for a prospective University student...,Cawkii,45,6,12,"I thought I would post up some advice for people before I move onto some programming for my course (Computer Science) It's 2:19am here in England

This advice is based on mistakes I've made through my first year of university.

**Time Management**

Of course this might be something that some people have a hold of, you do what you like and if someone doesn't like it, fuck them! Over my time at university I've found people from all walks of life. Some don't even drink, and would rather smoke the green stuff than get out. And I respect them for it, and they respect me for not getting overly drunk.

**Finance**

I think this is the first thing that you should think about before going to university. Some people like to set up a weekly budget before they go to university
If you work out a budget plan that's fine

**Meeting people and being sensible**

There's been a few times where this has come into play. I didn't have the best of fresher's because I was more of a introvert at that time. My situation at the time caused me to be fairly depressed. I had moved away from home for the first time and didn't feel like meeting people. However due to some of my regular habits I was able to meet new people. And now I love meeting new people

When I talk about sensible I mean you shouldn't go firing off your views of things to quickly. My most awkward and frankly regrettable moment was when I was arguing over Christianity vs Muslims with this girl. She seemed to take offence and I didn't really understand why, even if I think she doesn't see me the same way any more...

**Keeping up with things...**

While your at university having the time of your life it's always good to stay connected with friends. With the wonders of the internet and social media now it's easier than ever to keep in contact with people. You will find that as your away from home for long periods of times you will realise that you will slowly become distant from your friends. People will move on and may even forget that you were even in your lives. It doesn't hurt to keep in contact with people

If communication with friends isn't hard enough there is always your family members to keep in contact with

You might also find there are times when you want to go home. I had a time where I felt so depressed I wanted to quit university and move back home. However I bet that feeling off and the next week I went back for a weekend. For some you may have a very long journey to get home and it may be expensive. I've included some links at the very end of this post to help you out booking journeys home (UK
I would always recommend that you try and go home at the weekends

**Work hard!!!**

I can't stress this enough, without it you might fail your degree and you may be responsible for your home learning. You don't have to study in your bedroom. Find somewhere you can study, before you really get into your studies take a walk round your campus and find somewhere that might be suitable. Luckily for me I have a computer lab that is only available to computer students so I can be in there at any time (24/7) And not have to worry about anyone else distracting me.

You need to find out how you work best, try and find out before heading off to university and try and make with what you have and try not to have an impact on other students or the people you live with. So if your going to play music in the early hours of the morning. Make sure you get some headphones or turn the sound down.

**Helpful Links**

I've included some links below which will help out a university student

Then

 I was wondering if anyone has any methods of teaching yourself course material over the summer so that you would be prepared when you take it in the fall.  I mainly want to learn Introductory Chemistry and Biology

I only work on Fridays and Sundays and have the rest of the week free to do what ever.  I don't really have a social life nor friends so don't worry I won't be missing out on much.  I'd rather spend time doing something productive rather than playing video games 24/7 until college starts. 

My three goals for summer

* Improve reading skills

*  Learn a majority of Intro Biology

* Learn a majority of Chemistry

I received some books from a teacher.  Chemistry: The Central Science

But I don't know what else to do.

I used to be a stellar student back in high school, only to flunk all courses or having to abandon them to avoid the Fs. I switched programs 3 times, took all sort of classes, from chemistry to philosophy to programming. I even had to switch universities due to poor grades. It's as if I could never get down to studying (well, that is 100% the case actually).

All my life people would tell me how intelligent and great I will become, things that matter. I like the idea of learning, and working low-wage jobs has made me realize that I do, indeed, want to get things under control. 

As it stands, only to never really be able to concentrate at all. These past years are all a blur - I've learned nothing, wasted my family's money, wasted my youth. I thought that changing classes up would allow me to see what really interested me - it turns out I fail at every single thing I do lately. I can't even bring myself to start reading a book, for God's sake!

I'm now starting to see my friends graduate, but inside, I am a mess. I do not know where to start to make things better. I cannot go on like this. I know I need to see a professional, but I am REALLY afraid that if I don't do something about school quickly, I'll lose my chance on a profession and have to work at McD's my whole life.

I apologize for my rant but I really have no idea what to do now. I know that all I had to do was sit down and study

I only took the exam to get my jaded ass out of an environment I was socially and academically uncomfortable in. Few subjects made any real sense to me beyond the humanities

So, an eight-hour journey by car. My friend was uninterested in living the dorm-room life so I decided I'd get ""a job"" up in the area to pay for half the cost of a small apartment.

At 17

For the first month of my time there, but I wanted more.

Fast forward nearly six years, I was nominated ""laziest redditor"".

Today I'm 24; I know nothing of the academic world but want nothing more than to become an investigative journalist. I'm enrolled in my local community college with minimal expectations from my family and friends. I have no girlfriend and otherwise no prospects. I have nothing to lose and EVERYTHING to gain and I'm hungry for it.

But I have something to prove to myself. I want to succeed and work my fucking ass off more than anything, I have a dream. It's terrifying. I'm embarrassed-- I think I'm beginning to learn what ambition is. I've never thought anything of myself, yet here I am, in the midst of a college library, wondering how the fuck I'll make it through 14 units in the coming Spring semester while hopefully landing a gig with the school's newspaper. Is that even a normal semester? I don't know.

So, but also because I've never given a shit. Now that I'm older, in my place and ready to be a man, I don't know where to begin. I am my own biggest critic but I still need the truth from strangers and people who have any experience at all REALLY working for something.

Memory Strategies and Metacognition

**Memory Strategies** –

-  you can perform mental activities that help to improve your encoding &amp; retrieval
- levels of processing – you will generally recall information more accurately if you process it at a deep level

- elaboration 
 - in the levels of processing approach to memory
- rehearsal – silently repeating the information to be learned. Rehearsal is not considered to be an effective memory strategy
- people tend to forget information that is not distinctly different from the other memory traces in their long-term memory
 - very important when we are trying to learn people’s names

- **self-reference effect – enhance long-term memory by relating the material to our own experiences**
- encoding-specificity principle - recall is often better if the context at the time of encoding matches the context at the time when your retrieval will be tested

**Avoiding Overconfidence** –

- people believe they have highly accurate memories about their life experiences but even flashbulb memories contain errors
 - we are overconfident about our memory skills

- foresight bias – occurs when people have been studying for a future exam

**Strategies Emphasizing Practice**

- the total-time hypothesis – the amount that you learn depends on the total time you devote to learning (generally true)
if you simply re-read the material over &amp; over
 - “number of hours spent studying” not a good way to predict student’s GPA
 - *1 hour spent actively learning the material (deep levels of processing) is better than 2 hours of just reading it*
- the retrieval-practice effect – you try to recall important concepts from memory; if retrieval is difficult - and you succeed – your learning is enhanced
 - *retrieval practice improves test performance
- the distributed-practice effect – you will remember more material if you spread your learning trials over time (spaced learning)
 - you will remember less if you “cram” (massed learning) – learning the material all at once
 - this works for both recall and recognition tasks
- desirable difficulties - a learning situation that is somewhat challenging
- a delay of at least 1 day between practice sessions is very effective in boosting long-term retention
- **testing effect – a 2nd function of tests – taking a test is an excellent way to boost your long-term recall for academic material**
- Roediger &amp; Karpicke (2006). Students asked to read short essays on a science-related project. ½ of students studied the same essays again
 - when students took the test only 5 minutes after the last activity

**Mnemonics Using Imagery**

- mnemonics: mental strategies designed to improve your memory
some mnemonics emphasize mental imagery: we mentally represent objects

- Bower &amp; Winzenz (1970) – **when people use mental imagery

- **visual imagery can be a powerful strategy for enhancing memory**
- **imagery is especially effective when the items that must be recalled are shown interacting with each other**
 - if you want to remember the pair piano-toast
 - visualization mnemonics are motivating &amp; interesting
- to remember unfamiliar vocabulary items
 - keyword method: identify an English word that sounds similar to the new word you want to learn; create an image that links the keyword with the meaning of this new word
 - helps people who are trying to learn new English vocabulary words

**Mnemonics Using Organization**

- organization: trying to bring systematic order to the material you want to learn
- we need to use deep processing to sort items into categories
- retrieval is easier when you have constructed a well-organized framework
- chunking - combine several small units into larger units
 - people recall more letters when a string of letters is grouped into meaningful
hierarchy technique - system where items are arranged in a series of classes
structure &amp; organization enhance your recall
 - an outline is a type of hierarchy – it is divided into general categories &amp; each general category is further subdivided
- first-letter technique – take the 1st letter of every word you want to remember
 - lab research does not show that this technique is effective
- **narrative technique – instructs people to make up stories that link a series of words together**
 - Bower &amp; Clark (1969) - 1 group was told to make up narrative stories using some English words
 - control group received no instructions
 - each group learned 12 lists of words
 - **people using the narrative technique recalled about 6X as many words as control group**
 - clearly an effective strategy for enhancing memory
 - used successfully with people with impaired memories
 - to improve your exam performance

I'm going to make the bold claim that all of these are not as important as simply focusing on the subject. You know what I mean by focusing. Don't try to 'categorize' it and make a 'skill' out of focusing.

Focusing is what a child does when she watches the lion king for the first time. It's being captivated and having your head 'inside' the story. Imagine if a kid was watching that movie while standing on her head because her friend said it helps you watch the story better


The more you think about 'learning strategies' and the more you try to impose some strict mechanical system on trying to learn

First I am going to explain my situation. I have to clarify some things though. Some of you are gonna say that this isn't **that** bad. I know it could be a lot worse

I am 16 years old, but I also **never** studied. It was just easy for me. Everything was. By the time I got to high school, I had developed some **really** bad habits. I expected things to just work out for me. My grades dropped. I made my first C. Then my first D. Then more C's. I would come home and sit on my iPad, and not study **at all**. My school is a tablet school, so it is mandatory that we use our iPads, and I think that they were a huge part of the problem. 

Anyway, browse the Internet. Whatever. 

This has been going on for a year now. My dad is furious. Just a few minutes a go he told me I am going no where in life. That was after receiving an email home from my teacher detailing a 65 on a math test. I have one problem: **I just can't make myself work hard. I can't.** I make elaborate plans to do it

I just need advice. I feel out of control

Can some one tell me what kind of colleges I should be looking at, is there time to improve. 

I also need some pro tips for motivating myself. I need a schedule that **works.** I've tried 30 min on and 30 min off

I'm thinking trying 40 minutes on and 20 off. I just need some reassurance. Sorry for being a whiny bitch. I just feel like I'm headed over the edge.

Let me introduce myself.

I'm enrolled in a prestigious school that is beating my bank account into the negatives. 

 studying psychology

Rolling by with a pathetic 1.50GPA

Don't know why I haven't been kicked out of school yet.

I have abysmal sleep habits and no social life. 

I work 10 hours a week

No contacts/references due to horrible social skills. 

I read slow as hell. My memory sucks. Behind in all my courses. 

I'm getting fat from being sedentary. 

I am hardly ever prepared and have no idea what the schedule of a keener should be.

I don't know where my time goes. (I'm lying. I hide in my room all day every day)

My fear of failure trumps my every attempt at improvement and change.

My ultimate goal is to be a doctor

Please please please internet strangers
I'm broke from tuition

BUT i'm willing and ready to change now.

so how's about a reality check?

Time management is a huge problem. 

What's a typical keener student schedule?

How can I speed up my reading and processing abilities? shamefully admitting that it took me 8 hours to make flashcards for studying yesterday. is that unreasonable?

How can I maximize my chances for grad school admissions?

What should my short term and long term goals be? How should I prepare and execute?

AND.... What about my godawful GPA? How can I get internships or research experience with that awful digit?

HOW can this be solved

Please tell me I have hope for grad school and will be able to get profs to recommend me.

By the time I was in 8th grade, I purposefully started to answer things wrong on tests and homework. I was no longer the top of my class, but I was still getting good grades.



By high school, I wouldn't do it; I would study enough that I'd pass a test, but not enough that I would certainly ace it; I would allow my grades to be at a comfortable C in everything that I didn't particularly care about. I recognized how bad this habit had gotten my junior year, when my GPA was at a 3.2, which wasn't good enough to get into the college I wanted.



I realized I needed to step it up. I loaded my schedule with AP and Honors courses, and still not good enough for my top college. I graduated without having been accepted anywhere because I didn't want to apply anywhere else for fear of rejection.

Hey Reddit!

I'm a second-year in college who did the smart(?) thing at the time and came into school undecided on a major-- which was fine for a while

As one of my general ed. requirements I took a course in Game Systems and Design and loved it conceptually, taught in the Java programming language, really enjoyed it for the most part.

This quarter I tried to make more progress in Computer Science, including a small handful of industry giants nearby, including Google, Western Digital, Toshiba, Blizzard, etc.)

I ended up taking Data Structures and Algorithms (CS2), and a high-level Bio requirement for an academic society, all split between this summer and fall and it was brutal. Grades aren't out yet, but I'm gonna have to retake at least two of those classes for a more acceptable grade. 

On top of that, I was previously told that I can't repeat that class, it's an illegal repeat, etc. IN ADDITION to that, under the new set of requirements, the logic/philosophy I took is no longer a requirement, and I took the wrong version of discrete math/boolean algebra.

This brings me to my current problem. I'm considering a change of major, talking about them and how everything relates to everything else, and I'd love to know if this subreddit has any ideas for a major that focuses on those things and has viable job prospects after graduation-- I'm not really thinking about grad school at this point.

I've been looking at Pharmaceutical Science

Adding to that, even if it does set me back two academic quarters. But I still don't know if this is the right major for me, and I'm not sure how to look around, and it's been tough trying to figure out if I'm in the right place right now.

I guess this question is more geared towards software development people.. You don't necessarily need to know Objective C to help me find a way to grasp this knowledge better. Although I'm sure it will help. 

Okay
We're a few weeks into the semester now, although I'm sure most of the people that know the language started learning how the whole IOS deal works with Obj C.

We have these same labs that are like 
1. Build a program that asks the user for two numbers and an operator and outputs the solution.
2. find out which of 2 numbers is greater.
3. """" even or odd
4. diameter of a circle given radius
5. this gas mileage app.

And the first round was CLI
I'm just ceaselessly running into error after error after error. I'll debug and get it to build and it will always crash as soon as I start entering the first or second number. This has happened with every lab. I'm up to 4 so far
So I've been trying to read through my books and powerpoints and just can't find anything relevant at all as I flip through my IOS development book and my OBJ C development book. I feel like the class is just trucking by so fast and I really don't understand the basics
I'm used to just making my code work. When I was in C++ I understood the language. we moved at a pace where I knew when my code was right and wrong or could at least isolate the problem eventually and on my own with the help of my book and compiler. When it comes to Objective C it all just feels like patchwork and I just don't understand it thoroughly enough to get my projects done. 
Should I go outside my class for instruction? I tried that stanford IOS thing but of course I can't even get the calculator I copied from the video to work.. So how can I gain an understanding of this language rapidly enough to actually understand what I need to do in my labs? Whatever I was doing for C++ isn't working here. At a month or two into the semester I feel like I'm already responsible for so much knowledge
I don't know what to do besides read and do a bunch of programs from the book we are already done with as a class.

1355460568.0,14tt9f,Study Better by Setting Good Study Goals,Spudst3r,20,6,3,"Hi Reddit

I posted some this information in a previous Reddit thread

The content is from a University class on learning strategies.  Research shows that students exposed to the strategies below attained a higher average GPA throughout University compared to those who weren't.

So here it is:


**Setting Good Study (TASC) Goals**

Every time you sit down to study or accomplish a study task

For example

**Content** -- What you are actually trying to learn.  For example, so I need to learn the different stages of photosynthesis/cell breakdown from Chapter 3""  Recognize this before actually trying to learn it.

**Action** -- Define *how* you are going to learn the material.  E.g: 
""Instead of reading the textbook

**Standard** -- Defining how you *know* that you actually *learned* the material.  E.g. ""My standard for knowing that I understand photosynthesis/cell breakdown is by being able to explain those concepts in my own words without looking.""

**Timeline** -- Defining specifically *when* you are going to do a task

So the whole goal would look like:

*Learn the different stages of photosynthesis/cell breakdown from Chapter 3. Write these terms down on flash cards.  My standard for knowing photosynthesis/cell breakdown is by being able to explain in it my own words without looking.  I will study from Monday 2pm to 4pm.*

Versus:

*Read chapter 3.*

-------

By following this type of approach to goal setting

It's much more effective/time efficient to nail down the *content* you need to learn before beginning

All of this fits into a broader approach towards studying known as *self-regulated learning.*  It involves four steps listed below:

----

**How to Incorporate Study Goals into your Learning (Self Regulated Learning)**

Here they are:

**1.  Understand the Task/Course Requirements Before Starting**

Don't begin a task or study session until you understand what you need to do.  Preview lecture notes and the textbook before reading to identify what *content* and *concepts* the course expects you to understand before you try to learn it.

Tip:  There are three types of information to be mindful of in academia:

*Explicit information* -- the concepts and expectations that are listed in the syllabus or lecture notes.  E.g. deadlines

*Implicit information* -- the concepts you are expected to understand or connect with that are not stated in your course content.  To identify this information

*Socio-contextual information* -- department/faculty specific ways of doing things that you are expected to be aware of.  E.g. Engineering will have different assignment formatting standards compared to English.  Different academic cultures create different standards and expectations--so be mindful of the differences.

**2. Plan and Set Goals for the Task**

Once you understand what you need to do

**3.  Start doing the Task**

Complete the task or study session as you planned.  If you have trouble motivating yourself to do the task

**4. Look back and Monitor your Results**

Did you succeed in completing your goal or not?  Were you too ambitious, your goals will keep becoming better.

I'm finding it far more difficult to make progress on studying than on my other challenges I've taken up (nofap, sleeps at decent times, etc.). It makes sense because like the others, I don't really have much experience of just doing a bit every day, I've only ever really crammed a week or two weeks before the exam and gotten through that way, but unlike the other focus points in my life, I'm trying to do a hell of a lot of it straight off the bat. 

It's not like I'm doing that with running; I'm doing incremental progress to avoid injury, setting unrealistic goals and failing to meet them. So for the past three days or so I've been frustrated with my studying efforts. I haven't been able to understand why I can't get a grip on it, just focus in the morning and get a solid four hours done! WHY NOT? I just don't get it. I've been experiencing procrastination, simple lack of motivation, distracting myself by opening up the internet, making excuses, feeling frequent frustration

So what I'm attempting to do now is understand it. I have a bunch of resources to refer to (largely from reddit resources such as this one), and how I can control it better, get better results and more. I'm meditating, but that's a different aspect of my life. It calms me, keeps me cool, and probably has numerous other benefits, but it's simply a different experiment in what has become my life of experiments. And I'm making a shit ton of notes, and noted on paper stuff. 

Hopefully this will move me further forward and get me some answers.

 I didn't think it would be this hard, etc. I'm a bit wired now, I suppose it's from reading about focus. Just wrote a shit ton of notes, haha.

I'll probably update with my progress

It seems that I had lost ANY recall of what I studied the past two days for. The night before, I suffered primarily from speed. It took longer for me to process the question than any of my peers due to sleep deprivation. As a result, I was the last one to leave class.

Going to the library to sever all distractions results in instant headaches. 

Sat down and started from scratch by re-readying chapters and making sure I understand concepts. It seems to be going in one ear and out the other.

My first 3 1/2 years at a fairly prestigious University I was pretty driven as a student.  I wanted to make up for my mediocre study habits in High School and really make it in my area of interest at the time (medical research).  I had a pretty solid GPA my first couple of years, after lots of sleep deprivation due to the demanding coursework/labwork, working with an extremely abusive grad student and douchey PI, and having to take numerous courses with this one particularly sadistic instructor, my mental health took it's toll and I was basically unable to function in academia for the rest of my final year.  I wound up taking a good year off where I got therapy and also realized that my interest in pursuing a career in biomedical research was more or less of a forced interest.  I found out that my true passion was in computer and information science which I had spent hours each day studying for pleasure.  Now I've come back to finish a few remaining general education requirements and a couple of major courses in hopes that I would be in a better mental state than before to focus on school.  However, I've found myself barely able to concentrate and will have major panic attacks even when the assignments aren't nearly as difficult as what I've achieved before.  On top of that, my interest in my major has diminished entirely and I can't even force it anymore because my passions for other things have greatly taken hold.  All I can really think about is how much more meaningful my life will be once I leave this hellhole.  I did manage to get by last semester, but not even the thought of that is enough to get me back into focus.  I don't have that same crunch time adrenaline rush as I did before and blasting loud music doesn't help anymore.

**TL/DR Formerly driven student was mentally and emotionally beaten to a bloody pulp by insanely strenuous coursework/research, but cannot focus on school because no fucks can be given and has academic PTSD**

Long story short I stopped taking school seriously after 7th grade, I found a way to cheat the system basically and not do any work.  So

Although that seems bad, then in learning how to make some private servers and what not. I ran a decent server and ended up making a few $'s from it, but most importantly I ended up learning a lot of shit that is actually useful in real life situations... It taught me how to critically think and solve problems.  I didn't really have anyone teaching me, it just was kinda something I fucked around with until I eventually figured out.  That was what really made it exciting for me I guess.  Anyway, because of this I ended up getting into some programming and I ended up picking up on some very basic programming skills, as well as learning how to deal with people and management of sorts.  I felt like that was more of a life experience than what i would have ever possibly learned at school, and this is what puts me in my current situation now.

So now I'm in my 3rd year at a community college and I can honestly say I have never taken it seriously in my 3 years yet.  I mean, I stress out about this shit every day, but I just don't put in the necessary effort to do it.  I know what's required to get the results that are necessary, and I know i'm more than capable of doing it.  I just can't get myself to care enough to do it, I feel as if i'm wasting my time doing this shit.  I can't help but to think the way I do, it's just the ideas that are naturally flowing through my brain.  I sometimes feel as if the idea of school is below me, I feel as though anyone is capable of memorizing a book and passing a test.  I feel like I am capable of doing big things in life, but for some reason I feel as though I'll figure something out if I'm not wasting 75% of my day with school + schoolwork.  It's not really much, but something tells me i'll figure it out when the time comes.

I really have no questions to ask, whether they're good or bad.  I really don't know what to think anymore, so I could use some opinions on my situation and this seemed like the proper place

There are a lot of reasons I might not have done well with german in high school -- me not studying well, and a whole host of other reasons.

My questions are..

Is there anything else I should be doing now? Should I make flashcards of the words that pop up on Duolingo? Should I be using another website instead/in conjunction with Duolingo?

What can I expect from a language class in college? How much harder will it be than in high school? I really want to do well in my spanish classes (B+/A) so that my GPA doesn't go downhill. I really like where it is right now! 

I also plan on getting a tutor should I need one

I'm a 1PD (first year in pharmacy school). I think I have a grasp in actually knowing how to study

I have friends that literally study all the time- from morning to late at night. Obviously

A little about me: I keep a planner. I make ‘to-do’ lists every morning and try to follow them. If I don’t finish everything, and I know many of the older pharmacy students because of that. I exercise about 5 days a week (running, bodyweight exercises, yoga). I eat healthy everyday (cereal and tea every morning, and walnuts, meats, veggies, my mentality is to stay healthy so I can perform better academically and avoid stress as much as possible. I don’t go out at all during the week. I am definitely not the type to cram. I’ve been there


Here’s what I think I should fix: 
-	I am addicted to facebook
-	Reviewing notes: I really don’t know how to do this well. Do you all review daily? For how long? Do you review for all classes? Or do you guys just cram everything a few days before? How do you cram effectively? 
-	Prioritizing: I try to keep up with ALL classes, but I don’t really know how much time to commit to each subject. 
-	Preparing for exams: I already know to study a week early.. but what does that exactly mean? Be finished with exam material and notes by then? Start reviewing notes at that time? If so

---

I am finishing up my Summer semester in 3 weeks and so far my focus has been terrible. My first semester last fall I did fairly okay at staying focused and paying attention in class but then I went broke and had to get a job. My job is wonderful, and I get to do some on the job learning. Unfortunately, it's caused some lack of time.

My first problem starts with location. I live an hour away from my school/job. I can't afford an apartment so I am living with my girlfriend and her parents. This means no quiet time for studying and the rare times I am home, and a whole lot of stress. 

My second problem is time. This semester I start class at 8am and I am done with classes at 3pm with only 15 minute breaks (classes on this campus are only offered at one time a day). I then go to work at 3:30 and get off at 9:30. I then have an hour drive home. 

So my daily schedule looks a lot like this. 

* 6:00- wake up and drive to class. 
* 7:15- arrive at campus walk to class stop at the vending machine for breakfast 
* 7:45- Show up in the classroom. 
* 12:00- Get out of class A
* 12:15- Show up at class B
* 3:00- Get out of class B 
* 3:30- Show up at my job across town
* 9:30- Get off work and go home
* 10:45- Get home eat dinner and spend some time with my SO
* 11:30- Go to bed. Rinse. Repeat. 

That's my life Mon-Fri. I work most weekends as well but I use the extra time to catch up on sleep. 

Where am I supposed to find time to study? Fortunately next semester I get out of class at 12:30 everyday but I don't know when I will be expected to work.

Hello

I've been struggling through High school and I'm finally about to finish, and I'm done, and then I can apply to a college, depending on my grades.

Throughout most of my years in school, I was told I am smart, intelligent, and my grades paid up to what they said, too. My grades were hovering around 93~96% from first grade, to sixth grade. I finally entered a prestigious high school as soon as I entered seventh grade, I found it extremely hard, I wasn't used to study day-by-day schedule

So I stayed in that high school anyway, no effort, I was careless, delinquent, all I ever wanted to do is just pass. As I entered 11th Grade, I started working really hard, I literally spent hours studying, long hours, I didn't feel like studying anymore. Anyway

All of that was merely the first semester, I couldn't get myself to study, but I did anyway, it was mostly cramming before the exam, I am really, really tired. I expect my grades to fall down to something around 81~85%.

It doesn't matter anyway, and I plan on studying really hard, no cramming or anything, my only problem is, I can't get myself to quit the Internet addiction, gaming, chat..etc. I also don't have a stable sleeping schedule, go out

1347096240.0,zjt9k,Online free (fairly remedial) Algebra course?,,9,1,6,"(Cross-posted: r/GetStudying

Hello everyone

I am a 23-year-old college senior. I aspire to be a military aviator. Part of applying for an aviator slot entails scoring favorably on qualifying tests, and I actually did take the AFOQT during my freshman year of college. My scores were upper average, but I feel they weren't very competitive (based on viewing numerous stats). Luckily, I can take that one again, and I've got two tries at my disposal for the ASTB.

Here's the thing. Algebra has never been my strong suite, I feel like I've forgotten at least half of everything I learned.

I feel that I'm quite an intelligent person and I think I'd be able to excel at algebra if I try to effectively start from scratch. Luckily, but I'm wondering if there's one that teaches algebra in the form of a free course, rather than an assortment of related links and explanations. I think my best shot at getting up to speed is to genuinely start from (nearly) the ground up and I feel I can learn most effectively if it is presented to me gradually and in a structured manner. 

I know that seems remedial, I think I just need a fresh start at this one. Does anyone happen to know if there are any websites that offer such a thing? 

Taking an actual class at my university (or another school without receiving credit) is not an option due to courseload limits

1359555869.0,17k82f,Compositions have been killing me for ten years.,Grioknosz,8,0,1,"I’m 19. I will be graduating from sixth form this spring and going to university within the year. When I compare my (study) life to those of many students I see complaining about their lives on the internet

My case concerns writing assignments of every length. Foreign language compositions are manageable enough, I am at a loss as to how I could expand on those subjects. It’s apparently never been a case of not finding themes that I could tackle or questions that I could raise. More likely the issue lies in the simple act of writing the sentences, of putting word after word. One of my teachers has told me that I have a very straightforward and logical way of thinking about things that makes me unsuited for producing the kind of exploratory, aimless pondering and questioning that English classes require. I have also been told that I apply too much self-criticism. I know what makes poor writing, but can't produce good writing, so I end up writing nothing.

It’s strange how our English textbooks don’t mention this as one of the troubles that can befall a writer and offer advice on overcoming it. It has made me wonder if it requires such a special rare kind of mental block that nobody has bothered to consider it an issue to be taken seriously.

Accordingly, for a few months, to drop out of sixth form as I didn't think it would ever let up. With these kinds of awful real consequences, surely I can’t be bringing this on myself? Not to mention that grabbing myself by the collar and getting to work on the composition has never brought any results, as my paper’s remained as nearly blank as ever. Unless the laziness is of a much more deeply-seated kind, and my mind is actively blocking any resolutions that involve engaging itself more? Has my childhood been that fucked up, that my brain chemistry has only come to enable escaping difficult situations instead of solving them? Maybe there is a skill related to growing up that everyone but me of my age has learned.

I have had this for as long as I have been receiving composition assignments. My earliest memory is from when I was 9, I have eventually completed my compositions , but usually not in time and never with grace. They have turned out lackluster and often at least partially incomplete. With some assignments that were absolutely necessary for graduating a compulsory class, I've had to resort to help from an assistant teacher. Those times, she was practically holding my hand through the process.

I've noticed before that I tend to be very confident about completing the assignment gracefully… before actually getting to work on it. Lately

Extra-curricular texts with a purpose of getting a message across, have never been a problem.

One rationalization I thought up long ago is that my quiet, all of the implicit outside pressure that shapes ours and my behavior and coerces us into talking, maintaining a conventional face and pretending to be more competent and of higher status that we really are, disappears, and leaves my mind totally free and unmotivated to take any long-term initiatives. Those explanations seem uncomfortably smug, though, and place the blame away from myself in such a way that they deserve skepticism.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/GetStudying/comments/17k82f/compositions_have_been_killing_me_for_ten_years/

Hello /r/getstudying.

I'm a 18 year old senior in Highschool, I don't even know if I have dreams or ambitions, which is quite sad, indeed. Honestly, I don't know where to begin and how to complain/ask for advice, I'm really depressed because of school, I've been a delinquent and a cheater most of my school life, so far I've earned my best which is 94.6% in total, all my hard work and the result didn't actually satisfy me, careless

So after I receive my results, and simply out of hope and motivation. I know that a few tests probably don't matter, but they actually do, and even if they did not, I have other problems. I'm a bit arrogant, and I have lots of ego, I am extremely bothered by other students scoring better than me, accepting the fact that someone else is better than me is truly painful, comprehend it as easy, but looking at others

I've been visiting this subreddit for quite a while now, yet I still have problems. I don't manage my time right, I don't have a good schedule, I do not study daily to plant information in my brain, I am basically a delinquent and a lazy unmotivated person, because lately I've been so unmotivated that I actually do not give a crap about anything.

Won't it make it harder to remember because you're not in the same conditions (no music and its quiet) if you're at school for an test/exam or listening to a lecture that requires previous knowledge of older concepts learned?

I'm thinking it depends on the person which could merely answer my own question but I'm at a conundrum at the moment and need a second opinion on the matter.

Edit:

Maybe this is a more clear question:

will you still be the best at retaining that same information for use during tests or exams without any music in a really quiet room?

I am planning on taking the ACT for the third time in September.

I am starting to prepare for the ACT and I am willing to do the hard work to achieve a score of 25 or above. I never really practiced before for the other two times I took the exam. I took a class at school

My problem is that whenever I take the ACT I feel pressured. Whenever I take the ACT I feel like I am being pressured by the time. It becomes stuck in my head and I just start to lose concentration. I took a practice english test today. I first set up a timer for 40 minutes

 At first I felt good

I went over the answers and I felt like slapping myself. I got so many EASY questions wrong. Before I looked at the answer I looked over the question I got wrong. Looked at what I put and almost every time I got the answer correct on my second guess. It was so much easier without the pressure of the time and everything seemed so clear.

I want to be able to feel like that during the test. Is there any way to achieving this?

**Updates:**
Been practice testing this whole week.
I have been focusing on just killing the questions and staying calm. 

So far I have brought up my English score from a 21 to a 24
I have also brought up my Reading from a 19 to a 22.

But then shit happenned. I got rather ill, and was hospitalized for whole summer, and wasn't able to train for another year. I was so pissed at life, fucking everything I've worked for. I had no summer break due to being in a hospital. I couldn't play my sport anymore. I obviously got thrown out of a national team. My confidence was at all time low. 
But then school starts after a summer break and I get out of a hospital. I thought to myself, I'm going for straight A's (I was a straight B student before). The problem that happened was, some of my teachers found out about the state I was in, and I've exploited that. It's not that I haven't skipped classes before, but now i've been skipping them all the time. From Oct - May, I had like 250-300 skipped hours. It was so easy for me, I just said i was at doctors or in a hospital. I haven't been bad at school, so I didn't need to put up much effort. I did however spent a lot of time outside
Then I enrolled in to a law school which has always been my dream. But I took the first year off

I now go to practice's about 2-4 times a weak, I've got good friends, girls to hang out with, etc... I've also haven't been outside and drank for 3 months.

Hello Reddit


Anyway.  I'm going to start university next year

Today I met with an adviser to discuss my schedule and plans for college.  I told him that I intended to major in either biomedical sciences or pharmacology and toxicology with a premedical advisement track.  

When I told him this he sort of smirked.  Now high school was not a serious time for me.  I didn't study, but it is true.)  I hovered around 91's and 92's.  I realized would college is nothing like I envisioned, and that I was not some amazingly smart genius that I thought I was.  

I asked him what was so funny

My question to you /r/GetStudying is simple

I went to my local goodwill and stocked up on supplies.  I purchased Chemistry: The Central Science 7th ED. Both of Cal Newport's books.  I also purchased *What Smart Students Know.*  I even found a good copy of Campbell's Biology. I also got a copy of World History I from a friend for free. All this for under 20 bucks.  I also have a school subscription to Educator.com.

I have all these resources

The one thing I do know is that I have to create a schedule with all this stuff to prepare for college.  I start classes on the 26th of August.

I have an easy schedule this year.(Senior) Taking AP calculus is the only beneficial course.  

I am taking BIO 200, and World Civilizations next year.  I don't know if I should lighten my course load or not.   

Thank you.

I can already tell that this is going to be a wall of text

I am coming to you all out of a last ditch effort to break some sort of wall I have run into. I am hoping that I can find some sort of solace in knowing not only that others are in a similar situation as I am

I am currently in my fourth semester of community college, now onto my problems. 

Ever since I started higher education I seem to have been in a constant struggle with balance. When I first started, but fell short. Not only short, but I fell to a low B average, something that I told myself I would never achieve. This I can attribute partially to dealing with an intense emotional depression from my girlfriend of two and a half years cheating on me with a close friend of mine and someone I trusted. (I know, typical story, typical response.) Anyways, once I got my current job I somehow managed to lose all focus on school and focus heavily on improving my work at school

So, I was forcefully persuaded to stay at home and go to community college. I took this rather personally and told myself I would never be put in that situation again. 
So up until about a week ago I was going to school full time, and driving myself up a wall. It got so bad that I found myself finding downtime at work to just sneak in some study time, but this ended up stressing me out and my grades so far have not shown any sort of progress. (Currently sitting at a 3.5 in the middle of the semester.) 

I had some sort of weird epiphany and decided that I should cut work almost in half. And so this week I am working almost no hours and am able to focus more on school, I can and do go to the library almost all day on my off days. (I go to school two days a week.) But, with all those hours that I put into the books, my grades show B’s at best. I cannot seem to break the threshold into the A territory. 
 
Recently I also decided that since I was going back to back from work and school, thought that my study habits were failing because I was getting so frustrated so easily. So I picked up working out five to six days a week for about an hour at a time, and I am trying to apply a little bit of time weekly to playing Starcraft, a competitive video game which engages me mentally like no other entertainment can. 

These small changes have yet to show any sort of improvement or any difference at all since it has been so soon that I have changed my lifestyle. What I am coming to you guys for is or any other ways I can apply myself more, and enjoy my time in college. I know it is a lot to ask, and I hope that someone, or anyone can relate to my situation, but I feel like I’m driving myself crazy by taking on too much at once and failing at finding the sublime balance that is needed to succeed. 

Thank you all so much for reading through this. I apologize sincerely for any grammatical errors made. I am rather rushed this evening so I drafted this in one sitting. 

**TL;DR** Community college student with many responsibilities is having trouble finding a mental balance and achieving his goals academically. Need advice from those in similar situations.

Alright, a high school who at 1 point was getting D's &amp; C's and now is getting all A's by doing adderall no less then 4 times. It helped me understand how to do good in school and how to actually try. I use to try but i just never could fully do it, did adderall once and its been with me forever, but thats not the point of this post.

I am just trying to exspress the brain magic adderall gives. So when I take adderall it helps me pay attention like crazy just as its supposed to. But it does much more then that. It helps me learn by myself with no prior knowledge at all. Alright so when im in my astronomy class (a class that is completely hard as fuck) we were working on a quiz that I really wasnt prepared for at all. Of course I planned to take adderall this day so it would hopefully make me do better on this quiz (and it did) But yea, I mean i took much longer then everybody but my thought process was working like a mad man as i had not enough info to work it out properly. So I was going through all the shit I had learned in the past relevant or not and by then brain was able to piece the puzzle of this hard as fucking quiz. So simple this drug helped me learned shit I thought could not be possible to learn unless instructed. It seriously is a miracle drug to me as I have pretty much changed my entire life by doing it once. If your getting all F's and you actually started to try but you just cant, I recomend adderall

I do score in the mid 80's for most of my English exams

I've got two English exams coming up sometime next week and they'll be based on the following literary styles/periods - I've listed the descriptions of the tasks if that helps.  

1. Medieval
2. Renaissance
3. Romantic
4. Modern
5. Postmodern 

**Task 1 - IN CLASS** *you will be required to select and read one text representing one of the literary styles you have studied this term and answer questions to show that you understand how meaning was conveyed through the particular structures and features of the language which are typical of the style and era*

**Task 2 - IN CLASS** *You will be required to read one text and analyse the ways structure and language were used effectively to convey meaning for a particular purpose and audience*

* Is there any advice you guys can give me on how to get 100% in these tests?
* Could someone please summarise the things I should know about each movement? 
* One more thing,False,self,t5_2tl44,False,,,t3_12cxip

1367811650.0,1drt65,Allnighter questions,Kengede,1,2,0,"I just have a few questions on how to avoid these certain experiences I have when I pull an all nighter

**1. Spasm/Cramps**  

how to avoid? Charlie horses, stomach cramps, you name it. I am 21 years old and lately now all nighters have been giving me these horrible cramps. I assume its because I am just not getting enough fluids. Could be because adderall dehydrates and I always forget to drink. I have updated myself to put notes around my computer or alarms telling me to drink, but does anyone else have some theories as to why this occurs? I am pulling one tonight so i have bought like 3 gatorades and intend on drinking them all. If anyone else has some ideas or what fluids I should be drinking please tell me

**2. Unable to sleep afterwards or I sleep for 1-2 hours and then I cant fall alseep**

 After I pull an all nighter and take my test or submit my essay, if I pull an all nighter I am done with my test by 6 pm, I usually ty to sleep by 7 or 8. But when I do sleep I only sleep for like an hour or even less and then I can't sleep till like 2 or 3. I have tried camomile but that doesn't really work. I sometimes have these bad cramps (refer to 1) or have to pee alot (next question), or I just can't fall alseep. I take adderall so does anyone have ideas on how to just calm the body down, unwind and just fall alseep? Should I like watch a show or play a game or read a book and just ease it in? When I do these things after an all nighter I find myself antsy and too delirious to either enjoy the activity or do it long enough
