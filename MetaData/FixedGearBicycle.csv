The groups is really divided into people that ride brakeless/helmetless and the others (myself included) that ride with all the parafernalia. 

Well

I was ahead of him

I haven't really much more information about what is his condition right now. What I have is that he broke his clavicule and some skull bones. He is unconscious.

I'm sharing this to everyone that goes watching mash/macaframa/whatever and thinks that can do the same stuff. Well

From what we could tell about the accident is that his brakes' calipers were pushing against the tire and not the rim. He must have pushed it hard at some point and it ripped the tire apart. It must have locked the rim against the fork

If you plan on doing some heavy riding

I have a Pashley Guv'nor. I love it to death. She is only allowed out on perfect days, is a Thruster Fixie. From Walmart. I know how much hate it gets, but it is unwarranted. It really isn't that bad a bike, considering the cost. In the 2 years of riding it almost daily through a cobblestone downtown, gravel roads, and shitty, shitty New England weather, and sometimes I tow a kid's trailer with my dog in it. Nothing has failed, either. My wife also has one, it isn't helping anyone
