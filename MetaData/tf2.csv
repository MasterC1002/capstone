----------

*1: Sniper Ahead!

*2: I'm sorry!

*3: You're welcome!

*4: Go up!

*5: Go down!

*6: Sentry destroyed!

*7: Kill the medic!

*8: Low on Ammo!

----------

Also, he is not really a team player.  So instead of domination lines for medic, why not domination-assist lines?  These can occur when you get a dominating kill assist on your enemy.  

----------

For example:

Kill with Pyro: *Does somebody shmell brautvurst?*

Kill with Demoman: *He's drank 4 Liters of Scotch! I don't even know how he's still alive!*

Kill by Soldier: *With all these exploding

Kill by Heavy: *Can't you stay avay from the giant man carrying the spinning death machine? It's not good for your health!*

----------

There are plenty of others I can think of, or left out intentionally.

Also! **More muffled noises from the Pyro!**

What do you gentleman and ladies think?  

---------

EDIT: Your to You're and 8: Enemy Down to 8: Low on Ammo!

*Story Time*

Back before I really started to get into TF2, however, she left me with a lie and I got hurt, like really emotionally hurt. So my 100 hours I put into TF2 became 500 in a few months. I would go to classes, eat food, and then come back to play it. My grades suffered, and I barely made any friends

But just recently I came to the realization that the amount of time I put into this game was crazy

But it has been an expirience, I'll still be around to help r/TF2 grow with my writing. 

I am of course referring to the comic! http://cloudgateau.deviantart.com/#/d5c7p5r

* ***1: Class Tactics***

* **Scout**: As the fastest, sentry-busters, and protect classes without much up-close firepower, like Sniper and Spy. As much as it freakin' pains me to say it, we're disposable. Throw Mad Milk whenever you freakin' can. Giants will be hit hard by it, they'll be movin' so slow, they'll make fatso look like a sprinter. You'll probably wanna be rocking your Scattergun 24/7 for those 6 shots.

* **Soldier**: That Rocket Launcher's gonna come in *real* handy, unless you take the time to get the ammo/clip refill canteen, which would be freakin' handy for you. If you can couple that thing with a Kritz medic, those robots are gonna be in real trouble. I think that means you could get 16 rockets fired without stoppin'. You're probably gonna want to bring the Escape Plan with you in case things get too hairy for ya. Try to get above the critters too, so you can get that all-important height-advantage.

* **Pyro**: You're gonna want to play a mainly defensive game. I hear your airblast gotta big boost, you adorable psychopath you. That critical hit boost canteen should be your aim; it'll put that *stupid* phlog to shame. That rhymed. I'm a freakin' genius.

* **Demoman**: You've got one of the best defensive weps in the game, you're gonna want to prepare sticky traps in any free time you've got. The Scottish Resistance would be handy, I suppose; if you placed stickies in front of your pally's sentry, you could take out those Sentry busters for him. One more thing; don't get freakin' drunk; your depth perception is already screwed enough. Unless you're drinkin' your canteen; that crit canteen will let you set up crit-sticky-traps.

* **Heavy**: You may not get this, give out Sandviches. Shield the rest of us from the flak and you'll have done a good job, fatso. Stop lookin' at me like that, what do you want me to call you? Lanky?

* **Engineer**: I think metal ain't gonna be a problem for ya, you scoot out of there, quick-step. That crit-boost canteen triples your freakin' sentry fire rate. *Triples*. That's freakin' mad. Make sure you've got your freakin' wrangler on you to tank your sentry. The Widowmaker might be a good idea; that field's gonna be target-rich.

* **Medic**: Stay freakin' alive. We need you doc, doc.

* **Sniper**: I'll be honest, to start. Help your freakin' Scout and take out priority targets. Once you've got a few upgrades in the bag, go onna killin' spree like some crazed gunman. Useful as Jarate is, I'm thinkin' you may wanna bring an SMG; the Cleaner's Carbine would be freakin' ideal seeing as it crits on a kill. If your Soldier's rockin' a Buff Banner, bring your Bushwacka for a laugh.

* **Spy**: Sap. *Everything*. When you're upgraded, pally, just sneak up and stab as many metal guts out as you can. I don't wanna be able to see metal on that knife when you're done; it should all be oil or graveline or whatever these things run on. Your Eternal Reward may be useful for long chainstabs.

* ***2: Defensive Tactics***

Believe it or not, here's some tactics I adopted.

* **The Maginot**: everyone sets up inna straight line with the most defensive weapons they can get their hands on. Some classes are gonna be better at this than others; you're gonna want heavy-hitters. This is good as everyone takes a fair share of the damage and doc can run along the back and buff everyone up.

* **The Test-you-do**: Fatso can now should down projectiles with enough upgrades. This could be freakin' useful, this formation places him right nexta the sentry. Everyone gathers around the sentry to protect it; jump into bullets in slow motion if you wanna, I don't care. The doc and Heavy should stay next to the sentry whenever they can. Protect the sentry from any threat that comes it's way.

* **The Boston Beatup**: In Boston, get your Sniper up out offa way and have him spot 'dangerous' targets. The resta the team stays back until targets are spotted, until BLAM they come and get the guy he spots.

* ***3: Map-Specific Strategy***

We don't have a hella lot of intel about our fight zones, so sue me. It's also guesswork. Like I said, sue me. On second thoughts, do *not* hire the Soldier to sue me.

[Mannworks](http://www.teamfortress.com/mvm/mannworks/) clearly has a bomb-shaped hole in the middle of a courtyard. First things first, even a little elevation would freakin' help. Carry his sentry on your back, fatso, I don't freakin' care. One up-ramp should be watched by Heavy, and another by Demo. They know what to do. If we've got Sniper with us, he should hang back near the door, or stand on top of the concrete blockade. Everyone else

Yeah, where'd they go? And wake up, Fatso, I ain't boring!

We're finished with this part of the ARG! Great job to everybody who helped out!

**So what happened?**
August 10
* The Capacitor was made equippable.
* The High-Five Taunt was updated.
* The Capacitor updated to include some md5's.
* The Website updated to reveal [the Gray page.](http://www.teamfortress.com/gray)

**The jokes**

People were immediately suspicious of the Capacitor changes and started experimenting. Around an hour later, and around 11 items. People on various servers began spamming high-fives in hopes of getting these jokes, and the discovery was quickly made that the codes were different for everyone.

xPaw on the #valvearg2 IRC was immediately suspicious of these new jokes
Another user, with each item having a different year.
While this data was a step in the right direction

Around this time

August 11: The website updated

**The data**

Awhile later, for example?

As it turns out, was 0X00. After this was figured out, an alphabetical list was made, and data-value translation was made automatic.

We soon discovered that we weren't dealing with Banana Errors V2; Spy's data, according to the file headers, which tell you exactly what kind of a file something is.

Around this time

**The clues**

It turned out:

* Scout was hiding a saucy little QR code that read ""Adult"".
* Soldier was a BMP of some text that gave us ""Councilman"".
* Pyro ... I don't even really know
* Demoman played with ASCII terminals in his time
* Heavy was a russian QR code that when decrypted read 'Goldfish'.
* Engineer played with C++ in his younger times
* Medic was a heavily accented QR code that told us
* Sniper played with MIDI technology. His jokes decoded to a midi file that seems to spell out 'Unicorn' using morse code.
* Spy was... Interesting. He was a link to a zip file containing a KPDX database

**Spy's keys**

The password for the KDP archive we got from the Spy turned out to be ""053B140A6EC56DEC""

Well

...

In Reverse MVM

In normal MVM, the situation is similar; the attacking human mercinaries have only (5,15,30,45,60) minutes before the bomb goes off, no matter where it is; the robots, are endless

The blu bomb is a normal payload cart; it may or may not provide health and ammo. If it is _even briefly_ abandoned

The attackers' spawn does not move up frequently, and other clever maneuvers to cut down travel time substantially; additionally, engineers on these maps can provide vital teleporters as normal.

Replacing these spawnrooms are infrequent upgrade stations. Since robots are endless in this mode, only the first X robots in a period provide cash, or maybe only bosses, which are spaced through the course.

In fact

Waves grow in intensity and difficulty as the cart moves forward; control points can frequently trigger waves of bosses.

There are also a few different special robots to deal with. A few of which come to mind as especially useful for the mode:

The inverse of sentry-busters, then lock in place on the cart track, effectively becoming buffed level 3 sentries that can't be run over.

Gunslinger Engies: a swarm of engie-bots which

Giant Spies: A giant-sized robot spy. Gray's mechanical genius does not account for the small problem that most human beings aren't 20 feet tall. Still

Mann Vs. Machine is a game mode in the works

The MvM legacy started back in May of 2010

In the foreground of the trailer, like [this one.](http://i.imgur.com/VBer6.png) on the table, and at 15 seconds, we can see [another robot head](http://i.imgur.com/MCNHi.png) in the bottom-right.
w
Then, [The Engineer update page](http://www.teamfortress.com/engineerupdate/v00.php) on the TF2 Blog went live. On this page, there is an image of a [Scout robot, in a parody of Da Vinci's 'Vitruvian man'](http://i.imgur.com/aNdLu.png).

Jump forward to December 15, that can only be reached using No-clip, One behind RED's spawn room, and one near BLU's second point. [The first hidden room](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/5/5e/Cp_Foundry_hidden_room.jpg/800px-Cp_Foundry_hidden_room.jpg) is behind a door labelled ""TOP SECRET"", guarded by a RED soldier. Inside, there is a RED Heavy, and RED Scout, written on the wall of the secret room are the numbers ""1961 13 22 13"". 1961 is the year that the first Production Line robot was put to work. If we give each letter of the Alphabet a numerical value (A = 1

The [second secret room](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/thumb/0/02/Cp_Foundry_hidden_room_blu.png/800px-Cp_Foundry_hidden_room_blu.png) resembles a disused garage

Jump forward once again

The June 19, which, along with the ""Secret Diary"" survives the Pyromania update, and is not reduced to Ashes, like the other items. The Damaged Capacitor may be somehow linked to MvM, since it is an electrical part. There are also a series of 6 numbers on the Capacitor: ""07 18 01 25"". Using the same code as earlier, this spells ""GRAY"".

At the end of the Pyromania update

Also, and contains the same 4 photos from the cp_foundry secret room and a BLU Spy, looking at a [map](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/w/images/b/b9/Doomsday_secret_map.png), which appears to depict three maps.

Fast forward one more time to the 9th of August, which appears to be a Birth certificate for the Three Mann Brothers, Redmond, Blutarch and Gray. (Credit to wickedplayer494 for finding this)

It is speculated, which was founded by Gray Mann (Who may be in possession of Radigan Conagher's 3rd Life Extender machine) consisting entirely of Robots, based on the 9 mercenaries from RED and BLU team.

In the Birth certificate, which would point to Senator Gray/Grey in the [Poopy Joe files](http://www.teamfortress.com/pyromania/thepoopyjoefiles/).

Also on the 9th of August

If you feel that I've missed anything, and I'll edit the post.

Hope this helps get you up to date!

**--EDITS--** 

* It's highly likely that the person ripped out of the Scream Fortress [Mann Family Portrait](http://www.teamfortress.com/screamfortress/family_portrait/) is Gray Mann.

* Buster_Gonad reminded me of [this hidden page](http://www.teamfortress.com/classless/hidden/populace/) from teamfortress.com.

* In [The Last Will and Testament of Zepheniah Mann](http://www.teamfortress.com/pumpkinpatch/the_last_will_and_testament_of_Zepheniah_Mann/)
* There are also some as yet unused [""Bomb"" animations](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s-JYKggVDLo) in the files for the Soldier

* Added the meaning of the numbers on the Capacitor - Thanks to HeimlichCounter.

* Added the info about Gray being ""absconded with by the EAGLE"". - Thanks to Man-to-Sack.

* As of the August 10th Patch, Badwater Basin and Doublecross.

* Read hogofwar's comment below for info about the various MvM related files added to the game.

* A new blood splatter on the TF2 blog leads to [this clean image of Zepheniah Mann's will](http://www.teamfortress.com/mannwill/)

* As of the August 12 patch, is that whenever someone wearing the capacitor high fives a player, a joke will be written in the chat window. Many examples of these jokes can be found [here.](http://lab.xpaw.ru/tf2arg-part2/submissions.php)

* [This comic](http://www.teamfortress.com/bloodbrothers/#f=43) was just released on teamfortress.com after [someone managed to decode the ""jokes""](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/y2o54/heres_a_summary_of_what_is_happening_about_the/) leading to this [crafting recipe](http://tf2.com/crsk9.jpg)

1368110195.0,1e03tn,"IAMA steam market bot writer who recently got banned and lost $10,000 of items",dmn002,1089,305,http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/1e03tn/iama_steam_market_bot_writer_who_recently_got/

It was around Jan 13, but I was too slow, someone else had already purchased it.

Since the steam market opened in December, on Jan 17th, I decided to write and run a steam market bot, which would refresh the page, and start buying things at under the market price. Buy low, sell high seemed like an obvious strategy. It would output a log file, which told me whether I was fast enough or not in buying a particular item.

I kept my bots running as fast as possible by locating it as close to Valve HQ to minimise ping, running between 3 to 15 concurrent http threads. At no time did I feel like I was straining their servers. The bots would sleep with a few seconds delay depending on the response received.

I was able to make easy profit using this, for example: any genuine hats, anything with strange and festive in the name, or Level 0 vintage weapons and set buyout thresholds for each item. I was able to buy almost anything for well below market price. The most profitable included 2 strange festive scatterguns for $23 and $2, salvaged crate #30s for between $0.02 and $25, a vintage bill's hat for $0.02, and thousands of crates series #1,#14, for 1 tf2 key

Most of the dips in the graphs on each item in the market page were from my bot buying. In total I bought over 10, boring and unprofitable. I used custom email notifications instead of Valve's to email myself the name of the item I bought and the price in the subject line. Every time my iphone lit up, it said that I bought x for y.

It became an addiction.

I knew that it was against the Steam TOS

On 2 May 2013

Steam support has deleted all my TF2 items, including: 2261 TF2 keys, 52 salvaged crates, 3 craft #1's, 3 earbuds, a Max head and an Unusual (worth ~3 buds), and a couple of vintage timebreakers and a Dragonclaw hook (Dota 2 items), I am allowed to buy and gift games from the steam store on those accounts

Overall, especially the low craft numbers. I will never forget the experience of crafting those hats, it was a mixture of excitement and adrenaline, of being the first to do it. The items themselves are just an entry in a database.

Here are the backpacks showing the items that were deleted:

* dmn001 (main account): http://backpack.tf/id/76561198029635086?time=1367564400

* dmn008 (main buying account): http://backpack.tf/id/76561198078383626?time=1367564400

* dmn0010 (key storage account): http://backpack.tf/id/76561198082831146?time=1367564400

I had been making a steady profit before the steam market existed. I also don't really need the money, since if you break the TOS for any reason, steam can basically do anything they want to your account.

I have a bit more spare time now, and I didn't really play the game to start with, except for a little bit of MvM.

If I had any advice to give, and if not, start cashing out any spare assets.

In future

Well

There was a bit of lag at first but I adjusted the rates and it seems to have solved the lag problem.  I never really hosted a TF2 server before but I think i got it up and running well enough.

I'm just running these out of my home on a 5mbit upload connection on a quad core ivy bridge cpu if you are curious.  I know not the most ideal but it seems to work.  The PC is a dedicated server though.

A friend of mine got tired of TF2 crashing...and decided to do something about it. Below is his story.



&gt;A few weeks ago

&gt;This is the original letter:




&gt;""Dear Valve and TF2 team

&gt;Because we love you, one by one, very gently and lovingly. We love you, and you love us. You taught us that good things are always broken. You may be tempted to fix the cookies, to make them whole again. You may think that if you wear a chef's hat, and whip some cream, that you can fuse the pieces together again, just eat the crumbs silly

&gt;Enclosed in the box is also a recipe. You may find yourself unable to obtain all the material

&gt;From the 11th Robotic Platoon team
xirp.net

&gt;hl2.exe has stopped working""


&gt;In the box was a batch of shortbread cookies, and the lemon roasted potatoes recipe was both tasty and appropriate for Valve.

&gt;A few weeks passed by without hearing from Valve. I wondered if maybe those broken cookies had been too heart-breaking a gift to give. The thought did cross my mind that I might answer the door one day

&gt;As it rang at the door today, from Valve.

1340326975.0,veu75,[PSA] ARG Update - explaining like you're five.,CharmedQuark,1041,266,635,"I've spent the last two days following the [ARG](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternate_reality_game)'s progress via the Valve ARG IRC chat. Thought it would be handy to detail the progress that's been made on the ARG in a reddit thread (after having several of my steam friends ask me what's going on).

----

### The Beginning
* Valve [updates](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/June_19, [facepunch](http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1191864)):
   * [Goldfish](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Goldfish)
   * [Pocket Lint](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Pocket_Lint)
   * [Cheese Wheel](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Cheese_Wheel)
   * [Barn Door Plank](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Barn_Door_Plank)
   * [Secret Diary](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Secret_Diary)
   * [Damaged Capacitor](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Damaged_Capacitor)
   * and the [Banana Peel](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Banana_Peel)

* Speculation begins to occur as to the connection between the items and the upcoming Meet The Pyro and Mann versus Machine updates.
* In the TF2 schema
* Several users see '[6.22 V1500](http://optf2.com/tf2/item/5606)' written on the side of the capacitor and speculate that an update might occur on June 22. They also notice another number on the underside, 18 = R, 01 = A, 25 = Y --&gt; GRAY.
* Other users begins to note a 22 in the maps Dustbowl and 2Fort
* It is soon noted that the drops of the new items occur alongside other items and do not take up any weekly drops (i.e. they drop on their own system). wickedplayer494 starts to count the number of diaries; by the end of the day

----
### Eliminating the Impossible
* On June 20, with no patch notes ([reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/vc8qy/new_update_just_launched_a_bit_ago/), [facepunch](http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1187592)).
* Users quickly discover that whilst equipping the [Eliminating the Impossible](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Eliminating_The_Impossible) set

   * Goldfish: ""Thi.k o. ...""
   * Lint: ""... the ... .hi.h ...""
   * Plank: ""... yea. in
   * Peel: ""... may ... .n ...""
   * Cheese: ""... go o. ... t.e h.dde. .icke..ess ...""
   * Capacitor: ""... such .lace.
   * Diary: ""... deed. of he.l.sh .rue.    .y ... non. .he w.se..""

* Combining these gives a phrase from the book [The Adventures of the Copper Beeches](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Copper_Beeches)
   * **Think of the deeds of hellish cruelty, year out, in such places, and none the wiser. ** - excerpt from the story ""The Copper Beeches"".

* Clues are found in cp_foundry.
   * A collection of numbers is found in a secret room on the map --&gt; '1961', and 13 61 13 was decoded to mean **MvM**.

* There is speculation that the [Dual-Purpose Fruit](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Dual-Purpose_Fruit) set may also have a connection to the ARG.

-----
### ""Valve's gone BANANAS!""
* On June 21, again with no patch notes ([reddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/tf2/comments/vebdx/mystery_tf2_update_for_62112/), [facepunch](http://www.facepunch.com/showthread.php?t=1192347)).
* It is quickly discovered that when crafting two **Banana Peels** together using a custom blueprint
   * *Error de desbordamiento del platano* - Spanish for ""banana overflow error"".
   * *Yksityiskohtainen raportti* - Finnish for ""detailed report"".
   * Banana Error #__ (1 to 8)
   * Code ___ (from 0 to ~388)
   * Hex String: 0x__ 0x__ 0x__ 0x__ 0x__ 0x__ 0x__ 0x__
   * *Cydnabod* - Welsh for 'ok
* Initially
* Further investigation of the schema shows another new string
* md5 hashes are added to the Eliminating the Impossible set. These are used later to verify the decoded QR files/hexadecimal numbers.
   * ""md5_388_1""=""9e86c9d1ba461d7c3b84ea4bac11b921""
   * ""md5_388_2""=""f2629207217ce651f1a76ce33346d4c8""
   * ""md5_388_3""=""5d1a66650820b260b043443137c23dc5""
   * ""md5_388_4""=""0361ca75733f3c21f4ba4ae216e92155""
   * ""md5_388_5""=""a0370078eaafd706e75e6a2a45b5678f""
   * ""md5_388_6""=""0a009353adac7c721d8b4a188a9f8517""
   * ""md5_388_7""=""6f1d22a53f398fd4404b7fc9d7b1f356""
   * ""md5_388_8""=""eae894257e8b1502807a3a94fd2fcc1c""

* A **theory** develops: each of the banana error numbers represents a PNG image
* It is theorised that the images might be [QR Codes](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_code)
* [A list is compiled for all the known hex codes.](http://xpaw.ru/tf2-magic/list.php)
* Submit your codes [HERE](http://xpaw.ru/tf2-magic/). 
* For those interested

-----
### Elementary
* The QR codes are successfully decoded. An album of the images they contained and the stitched image can be found [here](http://imgur.com/jXvZE,XXPTE,UBIq0,UJvmo,RXAkv,oIrUR). And a direct link to the [completed image](http://i.imgur.com/oIrUR.jpg).
   
* Valve updates the [tf2 blog](http://teamfortress.com/post.php?id=8045)
   * A [screencap](http://i.imgur.com/PDMEl.png) is taken from the linked youtube video on the new blog post. A connection between Goldfish
* Speculation is rife on the connection between Poopy Joe, Goldfish and Ubernet. Super Monday Night Combat releases an update which introduces a new [space suit](http://www.uberent.com/forums/download/file.php?id=6011&amp;mode=view). 
* You can view the ""hub"" of the work as well as the completed QR codes [here](http://xkeeper.net/private/portal/tf2.php). A big thankyou to xkeeper
* And last but not least

* The current theory is that [**Poopy Joe**](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Poopy_Joe#Poopy_Joe) could be the Pyro. This isn't confirmed though!
* Note that tomorrow is the 1 year anniversary of **Barnblitz** and Saxton Hale was thinking of a place starting with ""Ba.."". With thanks to k3rn3!
* We're also looking at an update on the 22nd June at 1500 hours
* Valve and [Adult Swim](http://www.adultswim.com/promos/valve/) appear to be teaming up after Adult Swim's website and Twitter stream feature a promotional tie in with Valve.

EDIT2: I have received an overwhelming amount of friend requests
Since many people asked me
*****
EDIT3: I have released a new guide
*****

When it comes to technical customizations, etc. (Also, apparently many veteran players don't know about very important stuff such as hit sounds).

I'm gonna start with pretty basic stuff and go over to more advanced settings

1) Settings

* Advanced keyboard settings

* Mouse sensitivity

2) Advanced Options

* Auto reload

* Dingalings (hit sounds)

* Damage text

3) Configs

* General how-to

* FPS configs

* Dingalings

* Reset config

* Other configs

4) Launch Options

5) HUDs

* Custom HUDs

* Modifying damage text
    

*****
**1.Settings**
=======
    
    
Most users go through the Options screen at some point
    
- In the Keyboard tab
Fast weapon switch means that when you press 2 you switch to your secondary weapon immediately (when it's unticked you will have to 'confirm' it). This is a left-over from Counter-Strike (or, where you could carry multiple weapons in the same slot.
Developer console let's you open the console by pressing the tilde (~ or `) key (it's next to 1

- Mouse sensitivity is extremely important. Go on a server and place your mouse on the left side of your mousepad and move it all across your mousepad to the right. You should do around 1.5-2.5 360 degree spins, but it's recommend to stay within that range. I used to play with 13 sensitivity (yes, I know...) and could do around 6-7 full spins when I moved my mouse from one side of the mousepad to the other. Now I'm on 3.25 with 2 full spins and I can tell you it's much better, even if I had to take a week to get used to it.
    
*****
**2.Advanced Options**
=======
    
    
This is the part most people miss

- Automatically reload weapons when you're not firing:

Pretty self explanatory - when you stop firing your weapon, in TF2 you can stop reloading at any time and start shooting instantly. So if you're reloading your shotgun and you see an enemy coming, you can start firing immediately. There is absolutely no down side here.
    
    
- Dingalings (Play a hit sound everytime you injure an enemy):
    
Oh my god. Please. Do yourself a favor. Tick this. This will make a beep sound whenever you hit an enemy. This means that if you shoot a rocket in a corner and you hit someone
    
    
- Display damage done as text over your target:

Oh god. I'm having a seizure again. This is exactly the same thing - tick this, it'll display a number on the screen showing the amount of damage you did. This is so damn important, especially when you know how much total HP each class has. For example, when I play Soldier, if I shoot a rocket and hit a scout for 90 damage, I know I can pull my shotgun and finish him off. Just like the dingalings, there's a bit of customization you can do here that will make this even better
    
    
The rest of the Advanced Options are class-specific so I won't be talking about them
    
    
*****
**3.Configs**
=======

Configs are configuartion files that are executed when the game is launched or when other events happen (for example
The config files can be found in steamapps/&lt;username&gt;/team fortress 2/tf/cfg. 
    
    
The first and most important config file is the autoexec.cfg. When the game is launched
    
    
Next up are class specific configs (for example spy.cfg). These configs are executed whenever you change to that specific class. It's very helpful when you have class-specific configs.
    
    
FPS (Frames per second) Configs are extremely important, but also increase your FPS dramatically. I have around 30 FPS without a high FPS config, and a costant 120 FPS with it. You may think now that playing with 20-40 FPS is fine, but when you play with 120 FPS you'll realize how much better you play. There are a couple of different configs, but I personally like [Chris' maxframes config](http://www.fakkelbrigade.eu/chris/configs/). To use it, press ""maxframes"" on the left and copy-paste that to your autoexec.cfg. You might also want to go over it because there are some customizable settings in it.
    
    
When it comes to dingalings

    tf_dingaling_pitchmaxdmg ""#""
    tf_dingaling_pitchmindmg ""#""
These settings will change the pitch according to the damage you do

 ~~    tf_dingaling_wav_override ""x""~~
~~This will override the default hit sound with your own sound.~~  
EDIT: I stand corrected. This has been updated
There's a great [website](http://tf2dingalings.com/) with many hit sounds to choose from. I personally like the good ol' [Quake 3 hit sound](http://tf2dingalings.com/sound/details/6).

To save you the trouble
    tf_dingalingaling ""1""
    tf_dingaling_pitchmaxdmg ""50""
    tf_dingaling_pitchmindmg ""150""
    
    
Next up: Reset configs!

When you start adding many class-specific configs, Q will still call for help. This is where a reset config comes to play - you can probably skip this if you don't plan on using any class-specific configs, but I still recommend it.

Make a new config, soldier.cfg, etc...) and put ""exec reset.cfg"". That's pretty much it! Now whenever you change a bind in one class, make sure you reset it in the reset.cfg. For example, if I put 'bind MOUSE2 say_team ""**UBER USED**""' in my medic config, I will add a line in the reset.cfg - 'bind MOUSE2 +attack2'. If you have more questions about this let me know.
    
    

Other configs: I recommend checking out the [tf2 wiki scripts page](http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Community_Scripts) for other great user-made configs.
