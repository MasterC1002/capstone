[HDRlabs](http://www.hdrlabs.com/sibl/archive.html) - HDR environments?  For **free**? Soooooooooooon

[The-Blueprints](http://www.the-blueprints.com/) Has tons of blueprints of real-world (and some fantasy) vehicles

[BlenderDipom](http://www.blenderdiplom.com/index.php) - High-quality tutorials.

[Blender Nerd](http://blendernerd.com/) - High quality tutorials and a few model downloads.

[Metalix](http://www.metalix.co.nz/) - A rather unpretty site with some tutorials with some useful advice.  Also a few downloads in the vault section.

[Blender Nation](http://www.blendernation.com/) - Probably one of the better Blender news

[blendtuts](http://blendtuts.com/) - More tutorials!  They have a really good absolute beginner series.

[Vimeo's Blender Tutorial Channel](http://vimeo.com/channels/blendertuts) - has some good stuff.  Also check youtube!


Now, don't feel obligated to tackle each and every tutorial... even though it's probably ""better"" if you do.  The important thing is that you *watch* someone else work, get ideas, tips and advice.

You can learn a bunch just by seeing how a particular artist handles topology or textures or whatever.  I assure you

Regardless

I rendered this scene like 5 times with different objects and lightning until I finally got what I wanted. I started with a vase, a different and more improved wine bottle, I then got to a couple of whiskey glasses and the whiskey bottle, and finally after many tries, I rendered this. Three whiskey glasses and their whiskey bottle.

I know this is not a super-realistic-WOW scene

Image was rendered at 3000 samples using cycles; it only took about 11 hours. I then edited it in another software to remove some of the remaining noise

Hope you guys like it and thank you all of you who helped me and gave me advice throughout the process.

-What is good and should be in the beginning?

-What could be improved with what I have?

And some important

-Does anyone has a list of companies that uses blender that I could send this reel to? If possible, if it is not a problem.

-Where is the best place I could post this to get this help I need? I posted it in blenderartists. Any place else?

And, do you guys think I should include it?

------------

**Planning**

Before you make anything

For the piece I showed the other day, because I'm making a game in this setting. It's a simple idea, really.

Take a moment and decide on what you wish to model after

**Base Mesh**

You will want to start with something very

For comparison

**Techniques**

*Multi-Resolution and Sculpting*

Yes

Do not needlessly increase the mesh resolution; do what you can first with what is available. A lot of this technique involves building on layers you have created in previous resolutions. In some cases

The great thing about these tools is that they have a very forgiving nature.

*Brushes to Use*

A few brushes can give some good results in rocky or otherwise irregular formations. My favorite to use for these is the *Clay Strips* brush. It give a lot of texture and has a nice build-up and subtraction effect. To create the cliff face in my example, and stroke direction. Playing around with this can result in good results.

Another brush I used frequently was the *Blob* brush. I used this on parts that I wanted to pop out

Experimentation is key to this technique. Play around with certain brushes -- you can always undo! This is it for the general technique. Below I will expand on some of my techniques for individual parts of my scene.

**Details**

After you have everything blocked out and have increased the resolution a few times

*Rocks*

First, strong *Clay Strips* brush in subtraction mode to enhance the crease between the rock and the ground (this may have to be done at a higher resolution). Afterwards, I like to decrease the strength a bit, increase the size a bit, and work on addint some depth in the rock around the edges to separate it from the ground a bit more. I typically use this same brush in a mixture of addition/subtraction to texture the surface of the rock as well.

Here are some of mine

*Cliff Face*

The cliff face is the result of many layers of back-and-forth addition/subtraction with various sizes and strengths of the *Clay Strips* brush. It takes some playing around

Here is a closer look at mine: [cliff face](http://i.imgur.com/b2bie.jpg)

*Cave opening*

This one seems to be what people are most interested in. It's actually very easy and involves, adding little details as I see fit. I would also build up ""clay"" around the top and sides to create a more pronounced overhang, texturing everything similar to how I did the cliff faces.

Here's mine: [cave opening](http://i.imgur.com/HMn6s.jpg)

To close this off

Imagine years of erosion by water

I hope this helped someone out there. I'm happy to answer any further questions or elaborate on anything! If you would like more pictures or maybe some progress shots of another scene
