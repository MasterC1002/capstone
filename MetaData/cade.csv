We got the house... and I got to work.

Here are some before shots of the gross

http://imgur.com/a/CvKW3

Here are some progress pics of the basement renovation (which I did myself):

http://imgur.com/a/GJKtf

I built the bar from scratch and made a nerd montage and sealed it in acrylic for the bartop:

http://imgur.com/a/SAcMP

Here was the finished product (I am not in any of these photos):

http://imgur.com/a/R6T2Y

Then... the flood happened

It was about 8:00AM and we had been having some pretty heavy rain.  I had just taken my kids to school. I was out back drinking a cup of coffee looking at the creek roaring by... and I called my wife. ""Hey sweetie.  You should come home now... I think we are going to have a problem today.""

Sure enough

My wife came home and I called my brother in law to come help out.  As soon as my brother in law got here

When we got back, and we needed to start getting games and personal items out.

We called over more friends who weren't dealing with flooding and we had about 20 people over that day from morning till evening. To top it all off... I was running a temperature of 102 degrees. I had planned on resting all day. I helped as much as I could... I was physically a reck from being in frigid water all day and dealing with a high fever.

My friends

Before and after shots:

http://imgur.com/a/loBit

We managed to save all of the games. The washer and dryer were completely drenched early on so we didn't bother to take them. Our furnace was trashed as was our water heater. The only thing that was really trashed was the basement. All of the water came at us from the front of the house and not the creek behind us. The water breached a bridge up the street and came at us from the other direction. We were eventually able to get enough sandbags to channel water around our house (for the most part) and divert water back in to the creek in the back yard (which didn't breech our yard for some reason)

HAPPY ENDING: I was able to rebuild and reconfigure the basement and today it's a fun game room again.  It's got more room

BONUS F.A.Q.

""Hey darthphunk? Why the hell would you have a basement arcade in a house on a flood plane next to a creek? Are you a goddamned moron?"" 

Good question, and the one before that was 30 years ago.

If you see something pop up on Craigslist or through any other means that lists a cheap arcade game

If it's a game you like

The only thing that would give me pause would be severe water damage

If it's relatively intact and you think it might be cool/fun... just get it.

Here's the deal.  If you see something crazy like ""Pac Man cabinet. Turns on but screen is scrambled... $100"" or ""Galaga machine, in the worst case scenario you could likely recoup the cost of the original sale by selling the parts or have a good start for a restoration or (shudder) mame cabinet.

Best case scenario

When you get in to the higher price range

At around a hundred bucks... there's not a whole lot that can go wrong.

**TL:DR** *I bought a 1983 Atari Star Wars cockpit arcade cabinet. It is awesome. My wife is a saint who let me spend entirely too much and didn't even flinch when I had to tear into our ceiling

Ever since I was a kid, Co (actually it was probably technically in Glendale, but whatever). I've always been massively into games and also a big Star Wars geek, so this machine was always a convergence of two of my biggest passions.

From time to time I'd search for this machine and dream of buying it. Last week I came across a really nice stand up version of this cabinet. I was super excited due to its condition and almost pulled the trigger on the deal

On a whim I looked for ""Star Wars Arcade"" on Craigslist and I was absolutely stunned to discover a cockpit being sold locally. From the pictures it looked to be in good shape and it also had an Empire Strikes Back board installed so that either game could be played on demand with the flick of a switch.  

The price was quite a bit lower than I expected - the seller was asking for $3000, so he was motivated to part with the machine before his move, which was a lucky break for me. Unfortunately 3K was also quite steep for something I hadn't budgeted for at all... but I knew that this was a rare opportunity and i would regret it forever if I didn't at least try. 

I contacted the seller and offered what I could pull together at the moment - $2100 (luckily for me my family had recently received our tax return and we decided to squirrel it away as an emergency fund

$2500 was the absolute max I would be able to get and I let him know this. He had said there was another interested party and I was resigned to the fact that if they offered any more than that

I contacted all of my friends and pulled together some muscle to help me with the move and then lined up a U-Haul. I had planned to go the next day (Monday)

Wednesday came and it was a perfect day. The sun had returned and it was nice and warm out

This guy had an amazing basement. He had a full bar, and of course the Star Wars cabinet as well as a stand up Galaga machine. The Star Wars cabinet was in great shape cosmetically. I tried out the machine and it worked like a charm. He gave me info on a local guy he used to do repairs a few years back and told me all of the things he did to maintain it. I wrapped the machine up to try and avoid damage and we started to muscle it up the stairs, which was incredibly hard. 

Here's one lesson learned - if you ever get a Star Wars cockpit and you need to go up or down stairs

After loading the cabinet onto the truck and getting it back to my place I was pretty sure the hardest point was behind me. We had four grown men and since we'd be going down into my basement gravity would be on our side. 

Of course nothing is that easy though. on the second to the last step we got hung up on the overhang on my stairs - but unlike his this wasn't just a molding I could pull down, bracing ourselves at the bottom as we knew as soon as it was gone the full weight of the machine would be coming down on us. 

We finally got the machine down and situated. I removed the wrap and we cleaned all of the sawdust we had created off of the machine. Now was the moment of truth - had we damaged anything during the rough trip up and down the stairs? I plugged in the cabinet and was relieved to hear Obi Wan say ""The force will be with you"". Everything still worked fine!

I played the inaugural game and then my friends played a few games too. At this point it was after midnight and we'd been struggling with the move for about 6 hours, high price tag and sore muscles... it was totally worth it. Every time I climb into that cockpit and blast some TIE fighters it brings me back to all those happy arcade memories from my youth. ",,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,

Hat Trick(1984) it was called. We started playing it and were blown away. Its a 1 vs 1 Ice Hockey game. The controls are simple

Despite its simplicity this game never fails invoke empassioned crys and seat edge suspense during play. My friends and I years later still regularly get together and hold Hat Trick tournaments. Although it was released in 1984 (a year before most of us were born!) it is without a doubt our favourite two player game.

While browsing the net one day, but more importantly noone has ever managed to get a copy of this ROM into the public domain.

However there was still hope! I thought if I contacted the original programmer he may have the source code and I may be able to build a ROM for MAME.

So I sent him an email

&gt;Hi LetMeSootheYou
&gt; 
&gt;Team Hat Trick is the one game of mine I would most like to have a copy of.  Unfortunately, Hat Trick did very well in the arcades, and was the #1 earner for several months in a row when it came out.  Even for that time period, the gameplay elements were very basic; I think the key to its success was getting just the right feel to the control of the player.  With the addition of strategic elements like passing, blocking, etc., I would say Team Hat Trick was 5x-10x more fun – and addictive.  We had a unit in the hallway outside my office, as the game encouraged a surprising amount of physical exertion, as it was doubtless the most fun game I ever made.
&gt; 
&gt;Sorry I can’t help you.  Let me know if you find out anything elsewhere.
&gt;
&gt;-Lee


I was very excited to get a reply but I still don't have *Team Hat Trick*

If anyone has any information about getting a copy of Team Hat Trick I would love to hear it and would be forever in your debt!

Took it home with the intent of cleaning it up, I noticed it had a Scramble marquee underneath the Mr. Do sticker. I love Mr. Do, but I didn't love the cabinet it was in.  I decided to convert it back to a Scramble.

I actually had to cut off the last 4 or so inches of the cabinet off because it was so water damaged and chewed up. I stripped it of it's hardware and sent the metal parts off to be powder coated.  I stripped and sanded the cabinet of it's paint and patched up all of the blemishes with bondo. I rebuilt the bottom 5 inches of the cabinet.

Once the cabinet was rebuilt, new control panel, and new T-Molding.

Bam.  Scramble.

Here is a wiring diagram I drew up before starting the project

I used a LedWiz controller to take the ROM's output and control items such as: electrical contactors to simulate flipper/slingshot/bumper sounds, a 12V motor with offset weights for a shaker motor effect, and various other items. This machine gives you a lot of sound and feedback without the need to hook a speaker system up to it, however having that just adds to the experience too!

[Manual](http://www.arcade-museum.com/manuals-videogames/O/Outrun%20Upright%20Parts%20Manual.pdf)

I've been hunting for a cab (or two) to do a restore on and teach myself more about these great icons from my childhood.  I've been searching for several months and just came across this Sega Out Run for $80.

I picked it up last night

The previous owner said it was working fine and recently when he was playing the screen shut off and it started to hum.

The outside is pretty rough but nothing too serious.  Will need to be sanded and painted

The cab powers on but it hums (I believe from the speakers) and you can hear some very faint squiggly voices on the speakers but it's just jibberish.  The marque and one of the coin slots lights up and there is a red light on the PCB that lights up as well.  

There is no video nor does the monitor appear to ""power on"".  The previous owner removed the original monitor b/c it didn't work right and sold that a while back on Craig's List for a $1 :( .  He replaced it with a smaller monitor that we are still trying to learn more about it.  It's a Mitsubishi something or another

We tried the test buttons but nothing happened.  We also dropped a few quarters in the coin slot but alas

Looking over the PCB it appears to be in good shape. I removed then reattached all the connectors and that didn't improve things. 

The bottom of the inside is a bit dirty and we thought perhaps the first item that needs attention is the power supply.  The manual for this cab (listed at the top) does a great job of detailing the somewhat intimidating layout of that area.  I'd like to go through this whole area and clean it up

I've only had a few brief hours with it and just started my cursory hunt for more information.  It'd be great if there was an easy way for me to test these components but I may just need to get dirty and try and figure it all out.

I appreciate you all letting me share my excitement.",self,t5_2snqq,False,,quarter,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/1fpa7z/i_finally_found_my_first_cab_sega_out_run/

* ""It looks like it's falsely generating a foreground object at those locations; and always a wrong vertical location (since the monitor is rotated). Check your foreground object RAMs at 6P / 6R

I eventually was able to meet up with a local arcade hobbyist through the [KLOV forums](http://forums.arcade-museum.com/showthread.php?t=211031).  He had a DK machine himself, schematics, and other tools for figuring out what was wrong.

At his house, my DK boards seemed 100% operational. This made us think the cause of the problem was not in the boards at all, and had to be somewhere else in my DK cabinet.

It ended up being something embarrassingly simple: I cleaned the cable connectors on the two cables running from my power supply to the CPU and video boards

I live about 30 minutes from this location, but once I am I will love to hang out there and have some drinks and such. Was recently re-opened so it feels brand spanking new, had classic 80's music which complimented the arcade vibe, and they had all of the best classic arcade as well as some of the newer 90's ones. No redemption game! (good thing) And upstairs were some additional arcades and all of their pinball machines. I didn't have time to document a whole lot, but I was able to get a picture of my measly attempt at a [Donkey Kong Score (2nd place woo!)](https://sphotos-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/522465_10151462059702557_610760609_n.jpg) hahaha. Just felt so pumped about the place after I left that I decided to make a post about it! If you are ever in the Portland area, definitely check it out.

Double Dragon (ダブルドラゴン Daburu Doragon) is a 1987 beat 'em up developed by Technōs Japan and distributed in North America and Europe byTaito Corporation. The game is a spiritual and technological successor to Technos' earlier beat 'em up, resulting in the creation of two arcade sequels and several spinoffs, as well as inspiring other companies in creating their own beat 'em ups.

At a high-level:

* Used [THIS](http://cosmicjive.net/arcade/super/plans.shtml) plan as a guide for the cabinet only

* Installed a Wells Gardner D9200 27in monitor for that realistic arcade action.  Review [here](http://retroblast.arcadecontrols.com/reviews/d9200-1.html).

* Decided that I didn't have time or tools to build the control panel

* Running a PC with MAME inside the cabinet


Am glad to share with you any questions you might have.  Was a fun project

My hope in sharing is inspiring others to start from scratch with plywood

Here's the important specs:

 * Four players with 6 buttons each (one is always against the wall here
 * 24 inch 1080p LCD
 * Athlon X2 3800
 * NVidia GT 240
 * I-PAC 4
 * HAPP buttons and joysticks
 * Linux

There are more pictures of the completed cabinet on [the final entry in my long winded series](http://blog.patshead.com/2011/01/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-build-part-10---the-finished-cabinet.html?r=reddit).  There are some pretty good pictures of the guts on [the second to last entry in the series](http://blog.patshead.com/2010/12/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-build-part-9---the-computer-hardware-and-software.html?r=reddit).

I wrote quite a lot of words regarding the build

Here's the tl;dr summary of the design.  We built the shell out of 5/8"" particle board.  All the parts are cut to be slotted together, and we covered up the edges with a light blue t-molding.  The control panel surfaces, and the surrounding areas are covered in ""blackened"" plexiglas.  They look a lot like the control panels in ST:TNG.

We wanted it to be tall enough for actual adults

I'm emulating all the usual, Braid, Cave Story, or rRootage.  I'm also now about 3/4 through [Rico - A Tale of Two Brothers](http://www.imake-games.com/rico-a-tale-of-two-brothers/).  

I've started slowly updating [a list of games I have running on the cabinet](http://blog.patshead.com/2012/10/cocktail-arcade-cabinet-software-emulators-and-computer-specs.html?r=reddit)

I'm actually really pleased with the addition of the extra display.  It makes it more comfortable to play and it reminds me of when I was small enough that I had to sit on a stool to play games in real arcades.

I'm very proud of the work we did on this cabinet,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,,t3_182btb

In [the original thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/m0lk3/anyone_know_how_to_fix_this_donkey_kong_color/) it was suggested that it might be a degaussing problem.

I had a hard time believing this was due to degaussing because the pattern of incorrect colors was too exact. Also, fireballs, pies, donkey kong) were the wrong colors -- only the background stationary objects were wrong. If it was a degaussing problem, I would think that mario would change colors when I moved him into the area that needed degaussing, but his colors always remained true.

[You can view the color patterns in this album.](http://imgur.com/a/2y5CY)

This made me believe that maybe it was a board issue. Some online research led me to [this website](http://www.brasington.org/arcade/tech/dk/) that had many MAME examples of color problems and the corresponding chips on the board.

The evil General Morden and his rebel army has launched a coup d'état on the world's governments, as well as reclaim or destroy any Metal Slugs they can find so as to keep the technology out of Morden's hands.

Reply to: gcfxj-3068204926@sale.craigslist.org [Errors when replying to ads?]

Up for sale is a one of a kind piece of art. You may wonder how a 50 dollar pinball machine with 40 dollars worth of lights is suddenly worth 100k, $50 + $40 + thousands of hours of work. What took thousands of hours? Well to the layman's eye it might look like i just painted it with some black spray paint. However i actually used a stipple technique which consists of making millions of small dots with a single horsehair and since the pinball machine's original color was yellow, this took several applications to get the overall solid black appearance. Then since 1978 particle board isn't very sturdy i reenforced the edges with 2x4's i had around laying around my house. Now if you are some rich fat cat art connoisseur and think you can swoop in and offer me a paltry 10k or something i will be forced to laugh in your face! And then we can discuss where and when is a good time to meet, i can deliver in a 14,500 mile area. In the future when hanging pinball wall art is all the rage, a mere 100k would be a steal. Its like getting Picasso's first coloring book for 10 bucks. NO LOWBALLERS. If serious and really rich, please put in the subject line ""I have a briefcase full of money for you

**UPDATE** The molex on the wall plug that goes into the PSU was disconnected
I did notice that one of the fuses are missing and even more so a wire is just kind of chilling in the open looking kind of split. Its attached but it looks like it might belong to a fuse.

U.N. Squadron is a 1989 side scrolling shooting game released for the CPS arcade hardware by Capcom. The game was released in Japan as Area 88(Japanese: エリア88 Hepburn: Eria Hachi-Jū-Hachi) and is based on the manga series of the same name

The game is a typical side scrolling shooter, and 1943: The Battle of Midway, which are vertically scrolling shooters. However, like other Capcom shooters, the player has a life / energy bar that is consumed over the course of a single life as the player sustains damage, a trait highly uncommon among other comparable arcade-style shooters which normally use a system of reserve lives, where one of which is lost upon a single enemy hit. Before entering a level, when the level is finished
The player can choose between three mercenary pilots: Shin Kazama

One cabinet is an old Double Dragon machine that I was told that I need a new JAMMA board and a new power cord.  I got these for basically nothing except moving them and the time to transport.

Here are the pictures of the Double Dragon: http://imgur.com/a/kBRC1

I was wondering if there was a tutorial or a guide

I know it's very old and shouldn't look brand new

I also got an Atari War: Final Assault cabinet (pictures here: http://imgur.com/a/F2XLA).

I know that I can replace the t-molding and I'll get that done.  The monitor seems to take a few minutes to get to a bright lighting, repaired or have it be a ticking time bomb til something breaks.  The people I got this from hadn't used them in a few years and I'm looking at these as you would with buying a used car.  I want to make sure that I get all of the ""maintenance"" work done.

Is there anything I can do to verify that it's working 100% and give it some type of inspection in case I ever sell it? I'd want to disclose everything

Basically - what tools do I need

Funny story with this machine.

I work at a local video game store which my friend owns and we have a small arcade in the back. He had been talking to someone on craigslist about buying a dedicated 4 slot MVS for $400 for about a week and finally set up a time to go pick it up yesterday. Well about an hour before we go get it he gets a text message from the seller saying that they sold it. Needless to say we where upset but what can you do.

Anyway we know a guy in the area who collects and restores arcades and he had just picked up an After Burner but as part of the deal had to take two other machines,False,self,t5_2snqq,False,,neogeologo,t3_jaheo

I've been searching for a 4 player konami cabinet for around 45 days now. I have gone through all possible avenues searching for one. I have seen a couple of opportunities pop up

I'm in north al and it is an arcade wasteland. The only cabinets I ever see are old Pac-man/galaga/donkey kong machines. They usually want between 800 and 1800 for these as well. Is this the case with other redditors as well? 

So
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
X-Men
The Simpsons
Vendetta
Sunset Riders

Or any other 4 player (4 coin slot) konami cabs I may have missed.

So, but a good cab and monitor would be desired. Doesn't even need to have the coin doors, joysticks, or boards. Seriously looking for bones here.

Bonus points to those who own a real dedicated cab or pcb board of this weeks featured game

So this weeks featured game is Prehistoric Isle 2

Prehistoric Isle 2 is a horizontally scrolling shoot 'em up in which armed with your attack helicopter you must shoot down hordes of dinosaurs both in the air and on land. You are tasked with rescuing civilians from the rampaging dinosaurs and at various points in the game are instructed to 'Defend People' adopting a defensive role whilst any survivors in that area are picked up by a rescue helicopter. 

Prehistoric Isle 2 has something to tickle shoot 'em up fans . Directed by Yumekobo, Prehistoric Isle. If the fact of killing dinosaurs rather than ships or aircraft may call, we can not deny that the concept is original. The game sports a pre-rendered CG look that is unique for the Neo-Geo MVS. This is one of the more overlooked shmups for its time on the MVS. 

There's a choice of two different helicopters each with their own different firing patterns and bomb attacks. The blue helicopter has a slightly faster speed. Your main weapon can be enhanced in two different ways by collecting power-ups of either C or G type and up to a maximum of level 5. Various types of missile power-ups can also be picked up to boost your firepower. Normally you can only take one hit before losing a life but it's also possible to play with a life gauge if you are using a certain bios. Collecting the stars which appear is essential to achieving a high score.

I've read that when the machine is on it's not drawing from the battery so it's less at risk to suicide.

My question is does the machine work like some other electronics where it still draws a small amount of power when it's turned off but plugged in  and the battery only gets used when the machine is unplugged from a power source?

So this weeks featured game is Final Fight.

Final Fight (ファイナルファイト) Jessica, Guy and Cody, and sets out to battle Mad Gear's gang members and ultimately rescue his daughter.

1 or 2 players choose to play as either Guy, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's energy is lost. Energy levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in certain crates and barrels. Some of the Mad Gear gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players.

After the benchmark-setting ""Double Dragon"", well animated characters moving through colorful and detailed backgrounds, and with a control system that is as intuitive as it is complex, Final Fight is still considered to be the finest example of its kind.
Final Fight began development as a sequel to the original Street Fighter released in 1987

So this weeks featured game is **Lethal Enforcers**.

Lethal Enforcers (リーサルエンフォーサーズ Rīsaru Enfōsāzu) is a 1992 shooting game released for the arcades by Konami. The in-game graphics consist entirely of digitized photographs. This caused controversy as it allowed players to shoot photorealistic representations of enemies.
Initially armed with a standard-issue service revolver, a shotgun, or an assault rifle. When the player loses a life, his weapon reverts to the basic service revolver.

Enemies always wear sunglasses

The Japanese arcade version of Lethal Enforcers contain several differences which aren't in the US and European arcade versions. These differences include the ""how to reload"" animation (in the US and Euro versions, and an additional taunt which some criminals shout ""Die, pigs!"" to the player in the Japanese version, but was removed from the US and Euro versions as the use of the word ""pig"" is considered a highly insulting derogatory term that describes a police officer

So this weeks featured game is Michael Jackson's Moonwalker.


Developed by Sega (programming) and Triumph International (audiovisuals), renders the game unplayable at the end of its lifespan). The arcade has distinctively different gameplay from its computer and console counterparts, focusing more on beat 'em up gameplay elements rather than platform.The game is essentially a beat-em-up, although Jackson attacks with magic powers instead of physical contact, and has the ability to shoot magic power at enemies instead of getting close enough for a melee attack. A map of the stage is shown before it begins, and after which, Jackson must get from the start to the end without losing all his health


The game can also be played multiplayer if the cabinet supports it, with a blue shirt; the second player's character dons a scarlet outfit with a white shirt; the third player's character is dressed in black, with a red shirt. The characters all have armbands: blue for white outfit, white for red outfit, and red for black outfit.

Rather than postponing this dream, so I could get away with owning one. Now, I do have a job and I have enough money to buy one now if I wanted to, but I am aware that it's a massive expenditure for what it is. While buying a machine on ebay along with a PCB might set me back £200-400, £600 is considerably more. Of note is that you can buy either just the bare cabinet kit, or fully assembled / painted cabinet shell from that site. The shell costs £330 with a monitor included - still a lot of money, but I figured with the reduced labour costs it would be better value to do this and buy the rest of the parts from ultimarc etc. - first consideration: am I right to assume this

Second consideration. Although I like MAME and have no issue with it, and (hopefully) would end up being cheaper. However, I can't seem to find any resources on building a JAMMA compatible cabinet from scratch. Everyone just seems to go with MAME. From what I understand JAMMA PCBs are self-contained in terms of all the electronics so you essentially just need a PCB hooked up to a power supply, controls and monitor *(is that right?)*. I also understand some of the considerations such as monitor resolution and voltages but what I really need is a guide that shows exactly what you need to buy and how to hook everything up from the ground up with reference to JAMMA, which I've had no luck finding through searches so far. Ideally I'd like to run a Vs. Super Mario Bros. PCB to start with but as they are expensive it might end up costing the same as setting up MAME.

**TL;DR the most important questions I have are:**

1. Will it end up being cheaper to build a basic JAMMA cabinet after buying either the basic kit or shell from [turnarcades](http://www.turnarcades.com/products/main/classic/mini/) than buying the vanilla full machine for £600?

2. Would setting up a basic JAMMA cabinet end up being cheaper than building the equivalent MAME cabinet if I were just to buy the kit or shell?

Once I have those questions answered

So here's my main question/problem.  The RGB LED above looked nice

Finally, it doesn't stay for very long.  Should I use like, hot glue or something?  Will that damage the LED?  What if a LED burns out and I need to replace one?

Summary:
1. Do I have other good options for RGB LEDs that will fit in an IL pushbutton?
2. How the heck do you install these LEDs into a pushbutton so they don't just slip out?  That is

Here is where I am at in my first build ever. Be gentle

1.) - The Bezel: What material do people use for their bezel? I will have a 32'' LCD mounted inside

2.) - Plexiglass on the control panel? Is this what people use to give their CP a nice look to it? How would I mount this to my CP? Will I need to route recessed slots in order to mount my soon to arrive Sanwa Joysticks?

Bonus points to those who own a real dedicated cab or pcb board of this weeks featured game

So this weeks featured games are Contra and Demon Front both are “run and gun” type of games.

I picked two games this week because of the high difficulty of Contra. It is not an easy game

Game Info:

Contra (魂斗羅 Kontora), 1987. A home version was released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988

In Contra, whereas the manual for the American NES version sets the game during the present in an unnamed South American island. The American storyline also changes the identity of ""Red Falcon"" from being the name of a terrorist organization to the name of an alien entity. Inspired by the movie Aliens.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_(video_game)

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ne1g2gxCFHo


Demon Front (Chinese: 魔域戰線; pinyin: Móyù Zhànxiàn) released in 2002 by IGS. Deamon Front is lesser known game with mechanics and graphics very similar to Metal Slug. Fans of the Hellboy comics will also notice the similarities to one of the games characters. This game can best be described as a Hellboy meets Metal Slug Mash up. If you're using Mame for this one you will also need the pgm.zip/bios in addition to the roms to play this game.

Each of the four characters brings along a pet, and shield. Holding the shoot button charges your pet, and when released the pet launches a stationary devastating attack for a few seconds. The shield button converts the pet into a shield that is permanent - until you press the button again or it takes enough damage to disappear. Melee attacks and pet attacks release hearts which boost your shield power.

I've done some research and it appears that MDF is the board of choice here.  Most people use 3/4""-1/2"" thicks boards

Also

Again, buttons/joystiq.  If anyone who has a little more experience could chime in about maybe what material to go with, how to go about wiring the joystick so that it's just USB (plug and play on consoles/pc), and what type of monitor to use, it would be really really appreciated.

I'm pretty sold on using Ultrimarc to pick everything up

[Mag-Stik Plus](http://www.ultimarc.com/controls.html)

[Ultrastik360](http://www.ultimarc.com/ultrastik_info.html)

I like the idea of having both the 4-way and 8-way hardware resticted modes. The Mag-Stik Plus looks like it's easier to switch modes by pulling/twisting the stick so that's a positive. I guess the end question I have is

There is the added cost of the Ultrastik360 but I think it's negligible overall. I'm also open to other suggestions.",self,t5_2snqq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cade/comments/zi8rq/looking_for_some_tipssuggestions_on_selecting/

It's an old Mortal Kombat II cabinet
A lot of the wiring is either just hanging or has been snipped by someone for some reason
  
* First things first
* In the first picture
* Is it bad if the cabinet is laid down on its side?  It was at one point.  
* I have an old PC that just needs a new power supply.  Can it share a power supply with everything else or should I just use separate ones?  
* Any other insights into my particular machine / parts?  I believe the monitor is an MTC 900e.  I think I just need a JPac adapter.  In the first picture
* Is there any way to test monitor before diving in?  I think that's the part I'm most worried/clueless about.  
* Any suggestions for a general strategy?  Here's a list of steps I had in mind:  
-Clear out guts
-Get components working outside of cabinet  
-Refurbish the cabinet itself  
-Install everything into the cabinet  
  
Shopping list:  
Power supply  
JPac adapter  
Buttons/joysticks  
  
Any insight would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks!
