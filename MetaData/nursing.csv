Here are some tricks for surviving school and the profession.",dennis09x,26, did a year of med/surg and oncology. Just completed my critical care program and I am now a critical care nurse in an adult medical/surgical ICU.

Here are some survival tips I employed subconsciously that make life easier every step of the way (and in no particular order).

1) You're never going to learn/know everything... Deal with it. You'll just need to keep learning forever.

2) Things are going to change and get hairy

3) Transcend the cliques in school, not enemies.

4) Never be afraid to ask questions

5) Do your best to become a calm

6) Students

7) Go out of your way to help co workers. It won't be forgotten

8) Buy a good pair of shoes

9) Learn how to give a damn good report. The better the picture you paint for your colleague

10) If you feel something is wrong with your patient

11) Take care of yourself, they are almost as relaxing as a massage when you sit and watch them.

12) Blackout blinds

13) Students

14) One that may be controversial for the students but worked wonders for me; In school, it just means you will become your own professional.
Suck up the bullshit and chant quietly to yourself ""Only X number of classes till grad

-that's all I got for right now... I'll update it as I think of stuff. Hope it helps.

**What this will be:** A candid discussion on what to realistically expect and how to deal with your first year as a nurse. How to survive

**What this won't be:** All of the lollipop and sugarcane stuff you hear in nursing school. I won't be telling you how many pens to bring or what kind of shoes to get, no lovey dovey stuff). 

**Disclaimer:** I am abrasive, awesome, just back it up.

**What nursing IS:**

Nursing is first a foremost a job. We go cause we make money. If you didn't get paid, especially those that are graduating in their early 20's. Use it wisely, save it.

Nursing is a dirty job. You are going to clean up feces, you will get over it. Know your facts, transmission of illnesses from patients to healthcare workers is  ridiculously low. 

Nursing ages you. And I don't mean physically. You will emotionally mature way more than you expect. It was one of the biggest surprises to me when I started working. You are going to see horrific injuries, it's a coping mechanism. It's called Black Humor. You will begin to see patients as patients, not people. It happens, it's a coping mechanism. Don't feel bad about it, just don't let the patients see it.

Nursing is thankless...for the most part. Occasionally

**What nursing ISN'T:**

Nursing isn't glamorous. Most people will have some fun story of their aunts friends sisters daughters in-law that is a nurse and how they think it's great. That's awesome, people don't want to hear about what your day is like. People appreciate you. Take comfort and pride in that fact. However,  few aspire to be nurses. We don't get flashy citations, we don't bring in money for the hospital. Don't look for people to validate what you do, you have to do that yourself.

Nursing is not always fun. You will watch someone die. You will cry. You will be talked down to at some point, why you ever did this. You will make a mistake. You might even kill someone. 

BUT REALIZE: That despite all of these seemingly negative things. You will be a stronger person because of this job. You will learn as much as you apply yourself. You will get the satisfaction of being good at your job. And every now and then

**What to expect when searching for a job:**

New grads have it really rough right now. You are going to have trouble finding a job. Don't expect to go right into the ICU. Our job is one of experience. School teaches you how NOT to kill people, it will most likely be on a floor. Suck it up for a year. 

Work in a hospital. Unless your lifelong goal is to work in a Dr.'s office, and you will learn more.

If you are a guy, and those that are are in the ICU and ED. We are still rare in the nursing world, and you are viewed as a commodity. You still don't know anything, so don't let it go to your head.

**How to act:**

Did I say it already? Let me say it again, be respectful and you will learn a lot from them. 

I made the mistake of being a cocky little punk when I came out of school. It made my transition much harder. I embarrassed myself by spouting what knowledge I thought I knew. I looked like a fool in front of a patient for getting argumentative with an attending physician, and made the docs dislike working with me. I eventually got myself in order......but don't do that.

How do you prepare? With an open mind. Getting this book or that book before you start is a waste of time and money. Your preceptor SHOULD teach you all you need to know. If they don't, but WHY you are doing it.

There are 2 types of nurses. Those that do what the orders say because that's what the orders say, the better her patients outcomes (hence the push for BSN trained RN's). Educate yourself. Learn why things work the way they do, the human body is awesome, find a passion for it and you will excel at your job and in giving quality care to your patients.  

**How NOT to act:**

Arrogant. I know I keep stressing this, just know what you don't know. 

Story: I was precepting a new grad in the ED, her reply was “I know”. Well, I got irritated as she was unreceptive. So I told her that she was going to take over my patients, I had 5 at the time. I followed her around and made sure nobody ended up dead, and that things that got done needed to get done, but for the most part she was on her own. Within 45 minutes she was in the supply room in tears. That was the moment she started to learn. Don't make someone do this to you...

Realize that you will be disliked by SOMEONE on your unit. Don t' freak out about it. If you are one of those people that can't stand when someone doesn't like them, is”catty”. I know no other way of describing it. As a man, I'm spared most of it. But you women will have to deal with it at some point or another. Stay out of the gossip, do your job, learn. It will be hard, but it will make work (and hell, life) that much easier.

All I can think at this point is 'OHSHITOHSHITOHSHITITSANAPHYLAXIS! WHERES THE EPI-PEN!? I DON'T KNOW YOU!' His friend is there, what's your name, are you allergic to anything, etc. His friend answers most of it.

It's at this point I notice a very strange

I'm grabbing all the tools I think I might need, Stethoscope, penlight, CT machine... and still questioning his friend, as the kid is now crying. I look up his info in the computer and chart, he has no allergy history, only asthma

Finally

He looks at me

... the kid vomits all over my floor. 'I drank some milk to help the burning. Milk doesn't sit well with me.'

They go off to visit the other wings. I sat back and realized something: Compared to the rest of the nurses in the building, the RN supervisor, and one other LPN. I had trained the RN back when she became an LPN and I had trained one of the other LPNs. I took a minute to think about the nurses in that building and I was damn happy with the mix. They are all good nurses (even newbie, she has loads of potential) and I was glad to be working with them.


It was odd to realize I was the senior nurse and so many others looke up to me a bit. Last night made me proud to be a mentor and trainer. I've come a long way from a wide eyed newbie.

Four more ambulances showed up over the next ten minutes

He was life flighted immediately to a bigger hospital, eventually ending him in Pittsburgh's UPMC presby.  I followed him in my car across Pennsylvania, crying and completely unaware of what was going on. I heard everything from doctors claiming that he must have been using heavy drugs (I would tell them he wouldn't touch drugs, but no one believed me), to a stroke, to an aneurism- but no one knew.  When he arrived at UPMC I was informed quickly that my boyfriend had been born with an AVM, and had never suffered any symptoms

Over the next week I lived out of the waiting room, such as giraffes and elephants. (Before all this) He was very confused, and only slept when I was there with him holding his hands.  He lived in UPMC's ICU for a full week waiting to have a massive soft ball sized blood clot removed from his skull so he could beginning attempting to heal.  No one attempted to even pretend he would make it, some of the nurses couldn't even look me in the eye while I sat for hours next to his bed (he wouldn't let them place, or remove IV's without me there, insisting that he would die if I were to leave).  His vital signs faded in and out, as he was pumped full of drugs all day, so they took him in for surgery.  I was so scared that the last time I would ever see him was now, and me with my head on his lap trying not to cry

There were no complications, so I sat quietly at his bed side and talked to him.  He woke up saying my name, and his nurses came rushing in to help him and do their inspections of him.  His blood clot was removed, the trouble zones cauterized, and his skull stapled and stitched.  

Over the next three days, see out of his left eye, or even release his arm from a clenched fist.  He could talk, and he remembered everyone, but was still fully confused about where he was.  All of his nurses were more than either of us cold have ever asked for.  They talked to him, they laughed with him, they talked to me even.  I remember one time I got so upset I went out and sat in the hallway on the floor by the bathroom and cried.  One of his nurses came out and sat next to me, and told me how important it was for me to be strong for him, and talked as if they were best buds.  This nurse was so amazing with my boyfriend, he asked my boyfriend every time he entered the room if he remembered what happened

 There were four nurses specifically that went WAY out of their way to be great to my boyfriend, but instead they treated him like a person, with family, friends, thoughts, and emotions.  After about a week and a half (it seemed like months) my boyfriend was moved to a physical therapy rehab hospital in our home town.  When he left we was carted out on a bed, unable to move his left side still. (not even a finger wiggle.)  

The paramedics saved my boyfriend's life, has regained full movement, is finishing his final year at college, working at his job full time again, and is now acting strong for me while I go through nursing school (that nurse was right).  These nurses (at UPMC and Health South, his rehab facility) not only helped my boyfriend but they made me realize that I had made the wrong career path choice when I initially went to college.  I am now enrolled in nursing school and am on my way to becoming an RN.  I have hopes of one day being able to provide even HALF of the support, knowledge, and expertise of these nurses who changed both my life

On the off chance that even one of his nurses is not only on this website, from both of us we would like to say Thank you.  He is unable to remember you, or any of his stay at UPMC, but I will remember you for the rest of my life.  You changed two lives for the better, and I want you to know how grateful and appreciative of you, and your hard work we both are.  We recently made a visit to the hospital, hoping that we might find some of you to say thank you in person

If you are by some chance one of his nurses, and he is living a normal life two years and four days later.  All of you nurses are some of the most amazing people on Earth, and even if you didn't have anything to do with my boyfriend's brush with death and recovery, I want to thank you too for every little thing you do at work every day- even if you think it goes unnoticed, just remember-  there may be someone like me who notices it, and appreciates it more than you may ever know.

The other day cracked me up.  I had this really sweet little lady who I had only been taking care of for a few days.  We did labs and a CXRAY, lasix, neb treatments.  No catheter for the lasix as we are SNF and only cath for retention, prostate, or wound healing.

Her daughter came in and demanded to see the nurse.  ""ummm excuse me.  My mom has pneumonia and you guys aren't doing anything.  When I take her to the hospital for it they put a drain between her legs and it takes the yellow fluid out of her lungs.  Why didn't you put in a drain?""

I had to calm her down and explain that lasix is a water pill, why we don't pop them in just because she's going to be peeing extra, that we are giving antibiotics and nebs and indeed ARE treating the pneumonia.  Then there was a lightbulb.

With my new first job it has given me a lot of thought watching other RN's work

That patient that has been to the ER twice this month and you know by name...complaining about pain and wanting that Dilaudid ""stuff""


I haven't been through ""the shit"" like some nurses have.  Less than a year under my belt as a new RN, or even three shifts from now?

Or will I fall behind a wall of hate for the life sucker.  That patient that has no family, and wants to beat your ass because you were late with his Zofran.  Rolling my eyes as he asks about why I was late with it.  I can feel the frustration building and just thinking that at least when I get out of this room, there is an ""appreciative"" family down the hall that doesn't ask for much even when they are in pain.


Perhaps its my ""shiny new RN"" status that gives me these thoughts.  Shouldn't it be that patient that is a regular

If you ever spent 15 minutes with me you would understand I give exactly zero fucks about how people think about how I act.  I can be a total asshole and a loving person all in the same minute.  Is it my job to give those hard patients the care they deserve? You're damn right it is.  

This is life, charting, or doing something important your not doing your job.

It is our duty to care for those that can't.  If we are not doing this

Up vote, care for that patient that needs it, even if you hate them.

I would like to thank everyone for their advice and encouragement. It was a difficult situation for me, and witnesses. I left feeling terrible, I was shaking and anxious and had a million bad thoughts racing through my mind (did i just ruin this girls life? what if this all backfires on me and I somehow get in trouble? will all the other nurses hate me and think I am some kind of backstabbing snitch?)

There is an investigation going on now and ""Sally"" is in the process of being officially fired. Her next scheduled work day happened to be that Monday that I talked to the manager

I have received nothing but gratitude from the other nurses

I would just like to make a quick public service announcement to any nurse who witnesses suspicious behavior like this at work: REPORT THAT PERSON. trust your instincts. if it feels wrong, 10, 20+ years of experience who didn't have the balls to say ""Sally is not being safe."" I have been a nurse for less than a year. So even you new nurses, trust your instincts and go with them.

Nothing is more important than keeping your patients safe: not your friendship with other nurses, nothing. 

Before I reported her I had a brief moment of doubt. I thought about how devastated I would be if my license was taken away or I lost my job because of some mistakes I made. Then I thought how I would be even more devastated if a mistake I made hurt or killed a patient, oh well.

1375065147.0,1j92is,Reflective practice.,gonnaleave,67,8,17,"**Experience-**
58 year old Mr. Blue (pseudonym) was admitted from the emergency department (ED) after an out of hospital cardiac arrest at the local bowling club. An automated external defibrillator (AED) and effective cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) was used by bystanders to get a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC)


**Issues**
The ED had commenced induced hypothermia on the now intubated and sedated Mr. Blue, increased risk of pressure injury, shivering and coagulopathy. 

Upon reflection of what I was able to recollect to the student, using two sites of core temperature monitoring including nasal and indwelling catheter.


**Reflection-**
During normal functioning the brain receives up to 20% of oxygen and 15% of available cardiac output, which can cause reperfusion injury when ROSC occurs (Behringer &amp; Safar, 2003). Reperfusion injury causes mitochondrial damages and cell death, and severity is dependent on duration of ischemia (Zeiter, 2004), such as Mr. Blue's downtime of 20 minutes. Induced hypothermia is thought to decrease metabolism and cerebral oxygen demand and also decrease intracranial pressure, leading to a more favourable neurological outcome and short term survival (Zeiter

Possible complications from induced hypothermia to a goal core temperature of 32 to 34 °C include:


*  Arrhythmias- Temperature below 35°C cause negative chronotropic effects on pacemaker tissues, regular sinus bradicardia, with nil other cardiovascular comprimise.

*    Hyper/Hypoglycaemia- Form decreases in insulin secretion and sensitivity (Asare &amp; Lee
    Coagulation- Platelet activity is altered below 35°C and for every decrease of 1°C


* Infection- Hypothermia suppresses the immune function (Asare &amp; Lee



*   Shivering- Thermoregulatory defence mechanism, a neuromuscular blocking agent (MIMs, 2008).


*  Fluid and electrolyte disturbances- Hypothermia can induce diuresis, 2010). Regular magesium, potassium and phosphate monitoring was commenced on Mr. Blue.

1372425041.0,1h8uqx,I found what I've been looking for. Leaving IT at 30 years old to pursue pediatric nursing.,hiernonymus,58,11,36,"Some of the life experience and transition stories I've been reading here have been very helpful with my search into nursing and finding out if it would be a good fit. Hopefully this helps someone else in a similar position find the courage to love what you do and accept nothing less. A life not lived doing what's right in your heart is a terrible thing to put yourself through
 
 
&gt;“Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature will respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles. Dream the impossible dream and the world will not grind you under, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance in the waterfall. This is how magic is done. By hurling yourself into the abyss and discovering its a feather bed.”
― Terence McKenna  

I used to be passionate about computers in high school and on into college. I spent a lot of my free time on the computer, I learned and became accustomed to entertaining myself.  
 

After high school, I blew it again at a local community college, but I did make some of the best artwork I’ve ever done in my drawing classes there. After three semesters of that nonsense, I just worked for a couple years. Somewhere in those two years is a call center and selling insurance to rural farmers. Then, I got a job as a cable guy. No long term goals yet, but I figured I’m good at fixing things and talking to people I guess. After being up on a pole one day in 100+ degree Midwest humidity, I decided that sucked, and that I wanted to finish school.  
 
 
On to DeVry, essentially living under fluorescent lights and sitting on my ass all day, with my eyes and brain shot before I even got there. Paying attention in class was the only reason I graduated with a 2.75, which, for the amount of effort I actually put in, wasn’t too bad I guess. I continued my eight hours a day 90 words-per-minute job for a couple more years after graduation, with my hours getting cut
 
 
It was a huge relief to be able to get out of a cube all day, I was basically placed into what I have come to hear defined as a “toxic environment” and I barely even want to look at a computer when I get home.  This makes studying for certs difficult, but I did it anyway. This is compounded by the lack of privacy at home because for financial reasons, I’m forced to have a roommate. My empathy for helping people has turned into pessimism and spite, leaving in a bad humor almost every day. I hate what I've become because I remember that I used to be a fun loving, charming and charismatic guy. This was supposed to be a great career path – just get the experience, pass some certs, no matter what the money could be

 
&gt;“If you don't have a plan
― Terence McKenna  

 
In the last 6 months, I found my heart again. I broke down into tears each time I shed away layers of ego by listening to podcasts and lectures about history, medicine, chemistry, philosophy, meditation, nature, I know with all my heart that I want to be a part of it in a way that our future generations will be proud of and in a way that our ancestors fought for and allowed to endure. Nobody ever told me I was smart

 
After a friend recently got his RN

 
The relationship between my father and I continues to be a struggle. He is an ill-tempered, born again truck driver who insults me any time I use “big words”. My materialistic and cosmetically augmented mother has settled for a comfortable suburban lifestyle afforded by marrying an insurance salesman and has since started a new family after separating the one I was born into at age three. Her marriage counselor at that time gave her simple advice, which I believe to be sound advice considering my relationship with my father over the years. That counselor told her to run as fast as you can. In my experience thus far, the people that I love, and who supposedly love me the most, are the ones who have hurt me the most. Yet, they have supported me in my struggles. Family is a hell of a dynamic to wrap your head around sometimes, it only makes you better.  

 
Long story short, unadulterated honesty. They are incredibly smart and are almost never given the credit they deserve. Every person in life has tremendous potential but is often cut short by the simplest of things: lack of education, circumstance, or just plain shitty people. I’ve carried around some kind of jaded attitude toward having children myself, but I always suspected it just had something to do with not wanting to repeat a my father before me type story. During my search to regain the empathy I never lost, and to find out how I can use it best, it seems pediatrics is the best fit I can think of. If anyone on this planet deserves our attention

 
After hearing other nurses share how these children often appreciate a father figure in the male nurses, than to share the empathy and admiration I have for it with those who have not yet lost it. Hopefully I will be able experience life in its early years, in its greatest time of need, and death too I’m sure. Perhaps then, some day, I will be able to offer that experience to those who are in their later years, on their way around again, if not for the very sake of it.

Well, night shift in the emergency room.  I knew going in that working in the ER for my first job was going to be stressful, but I suppose I didn't know just how much.  

At first I was so excited and eager to learn--a few weeks after orientation started though, probably something to do with the fact that the NM looked straight at me and said, ""I'm watching you like a hawk, young lady, and the next thing you do no matter how small, you're out of here.  I'm giving you one last chance though.""  

Not long after that I went to night shift.  I've always been a night owl, but lately I don't want to.  

I'm not enjoying what I do anymore; I've literally helped to save lives but I still feel like I'm walking on a razor's edge.  The other night

On my days off I find myself sleeping the whole day away

I've struggled with depression all my life, and I get 14-15 every night.  One night last week I was yelled at by the doctor and charge nurse for taking a minute to get a rescue into a gown--apparently she was cyanotic and tachypneic.  I thought she looked out of breath but mostly fine, and her sats were good.  Nope, I don't know what I'm doing and it isn't okay.  

Then all I have to look forward to when I go home is sitting around feeling worthless

Is this normal?  Is this all because of work?  Does it get better?  Should I be more confident after four months?  How does anyone work nights and have a life?  

Is there anything anyone can tell me that could help?  I don't want to feel this way.  I love nursing

**The Patient I Failed**



I met her one Tuesday night, her bowel sounds were non-existant, and her blue eyes stared blindly at a ceiling she could no longer see. The MD refused to terminate feedings, but I held them since there was no digestion taking place. The woman was turned and repositioned every 2 hours, and each time, she moaned and gurgled as her lungs slowly filled with fluid. I whispered my apologies as I did the very things to her she tried so hard to prevent.


She knew what she wanted.

She'd watched her husband of 52 years die on a vent

So, gave it to her personal physician, told all her friends and family what she did not want. She wasn't eligible for a DNR, as she was a healthy 89-year-old, but she knew what she wanted.

*""I do not want any external device to be used to maintain my
respiration if my body is incapable of sustaining it on its

The daughter told EMS her mother was a full code, CPR was performed, and her heart was shocked back into a beat. Under the hands of those trying to follow the daughter's wishes, the woman's ribs cracked and broke.

*""I wish to die a peaceful

She was then sent to ICU, the other children were there, but the act had been done, over and over. No DNR was written, and the Living Will fluttered impotently at the front of the chart.

*""I do not wish artificial means of nutrition to be used

Her swallowing ability was lost in the storm in her brain that had left her with no voice, and the trach in her throat.

*""I wish nature to take its course
pain and suffering.""*

The daughter who wanted the mother to remain a full code also refused to allow narcotics to be given, and he said, ""the family can't get it together, and I'm not getting into the middle of it.""

*""Allow me the dignity we give to beloved pets. Let me die in peace.""*

I met her one Tuesday night, her bowel sounds were non-existant, and her blue eyes stared blindly at a ceiling she could no longer see. The MD refused to terminate feedings, but I held them since there was no digestion taking place. The woman was turned and repositioned every 2 hours, and each time, she moaned and gurgled as her lungs slowly filled with fluid. I whispered my apologies as I did the very things to her she tried so hard to prevent. 

Suctioning improved her lung function, all while the daughter demanded more interventions, and maintained that her mother wanted to be a full code. We had read the Living Will. We knew better.

We have had our clinical day and I just wanted to thank you all for your words of encouragement and support - especially Saeyia.  Your advice and perspective put me in a much better place leading into my clinical assignment.  I can't say thank you enough.

Except for the fact that it was sincere and honestly where I was at the time, but I had a sudden epiphany regarding my role as lead.  By the very nature of the assignment, my role came with it an inherent authority I hadn't anticipated.  

I don't mean that because I was lead, while still ensuring that nobody would be working with their ""partner in crime.""  It was fair, professional, and improved the productivity of our team as a whole.  

What an eye-opening experience.  Not only did the day go better than I expected (not perfectly.  I still had to deal with a low-level resentment and passive aggression from the biggest bully all day) but I learned a bunch about myself.  I am not completely at the mercy of the bullies (or anyone else).  I do have a certain autonomous authority over my own life that I should work a little harder to cultivate.

I now realize that, that I momentarily forgot I was supposed to be part of the team I would be leading.  Your comments helped bring me back to a better head space and changed my entire outlook on the job I had to do.

I was the leader of our team, but I can't escape the reality that I am at least partially accountable for how things turn out.  If I make myself small and resentful just to avoid confrontation with bigger, meaner, more overtly aggressive folks than myself, all I do is suffer and end up feeling helpless while I continue to help power the cycle.

In my clinicals I have found 1/2 inch air bubbles within IV saline locks and have ultimately had to place a new IV because I messed up the old IV by trying to remove the air.

‘Twas the night before Christmas
Little creatures were squirming and getting all set;
Machinery sat by their bedsides with care
In hopes that good breathing skills soon would be there.

Day shifters were home all snug in their beds
As visions of overtime danced in their heads;
While preemies on ventilators
Had just settled down for a long winter’s nap…

When out in the hall there arose such a clatter
The residents woke up to see what was the matter.
Away from the sink I flew like a jet
To make sure all was well at my baby’s isolette.

Some bilirubin lights with their powerful glow
Gave the lustre of mid-day to babies below
When,
Was an oversized stroller and a medical team.
With a handful of needles with which they could stick you
I knew in a moment it must be St. Nicu.

More rapid than eagles his specialists came
And he whistled
“Now, Neonatologists!
On
From the front of the unit! To the end of the hall!
Now dash away! Dash away! Dash away all!”

Up to each baby’s cribside they flew
With the stroller full of toys
And then
And tucked in the babies and got them all fed.

As I looked at my baby
Down our aisle St. Nicu came with a bound.
He was dressed in red scrubs
That his clothes had an obvious hospital smell;
A bag of stuffed animals was flung on his back
And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack.
A little red pen he held tight in his teeth
And a stethoscope encircled his neck like a wreath.

He was chubby and plump
And I laughed when I saw him there doing his rounds.
A turn of his clipboard and a twist of his head
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;
He spoke few words
And running down his face was a tear he had cried.

And laying his hand on the back of my head
He gave me a nod
“Each night you come here you’re aware of the danger
But your baby is loved by the One in the manger.”

Then the medical team gave a thumbs-up and smiled
And St. Nicu placed an animal next to my child.
But I heard him exclaim

I'm a (mostly) healthy 23 year old F. In 2009, I decided to go to the emergency department. This was also around the time the swine flu was going around, so I was quarantined while the doctor ran some tests. My fever was 104F. The doctor asked me if I wanted to leave or stay, and I said I would come back the next day to run some more tests. Just as I was about to leave, I promptly fainted. They definitely made me stay then lol. But I had to practically beg for an IV drip so I wouldn't get weak (I wasn't able to digest anything but tea and toast). 

The next day, and showed incredible patience with my awkward, slow and dizzy steps. I leaned on her shoulder for support. It has been 4 years since that day, but I still remember her kindness. I wish I could hug and thank her now (was too sick at the time to process what was happening) but simply cannot remember her name.

Although that time in the hospital was absolutely miserable

When I help people with their resumes I tell them, When you state the position title (like ""medical staff associate"" or ""student nurse"" or ""reception technician"") I know what those positions are, and so do all of the other people who are going to be reading your resume.  You don't need to give me a recap of the things you did when you were there.  I already know what you did.  You did the same thing as the last ""reception technician"" I hired for the hospital.  You need to tell me the things you did WELL.  Like the part on reception technician where you said, ""ranked top three technicians for screens per hour.....""   That is information that I WANT to know and you have it buried as the last thing you tell me under a bunch of stuff that I don't care about.  The best thing you did at that job (rank at the top) is the last thing you told me about.  Why?  Make it the first thing you tell me.  You're a new grad.  You and every other new grad's resume that I see did the exact same thing.  I want to know what sets you apart.  What makes you different and better than the last resume I screened?  No one is going to look at your resume and say, ""Oh wow, she knows how to do endotracheal suctioning!""  Because you really don't know how to do it.  You may be familiar with it, but you didn't do it day in and day out for a year.  You did it for a couple of weeks.  So that isn't going to get you hired.  If you can think back to school and think of what you did WELL (and be able to quantify it....like you did in the ""top three"" statement, nobody cares about you having your BLS.  Everyone has their BLS.  No one cares that you had your fingerprints recorded.  Everyone has that.  That's just wasting space on your resume.  Also, critical care, forget about cliche wording like ""problem solving skills.""  If you know how to solve problems

p.s.  I didn't read your cover letter because nobody else is going to either.   If you're writing a cover letter it should be written specifically for the job/physician/hiring manager that is hiring.  It shouldn't be a blanket, ""Dr. Smith, I am familiar with your orthopedic practice here in Anycity, USA.  Let me tell you why I would love to work with you....""


I hope this helps.

1)For anyone considering a career in nursing

2)Pursue your BSN.  I repeat

Yes, many of which are as short as 15 months.  You will have to rely on student loans/savings/financial aid for a little over a year, but it's a much better alternative than trying to find a job as an ADN, all while knowing you're going to have to go back to school again to get your BSN.

3)Pick a school that is located near as many large hospitals as possible.  Clinical rotations are key to preparing for your position as a graduate nurse

4)Ensure you have volunteer or other medical experience prior to applying to a nursing program, and you weren't getting in if you didn't have any experience in a healthcare environment.

5)When you are accepted into a program, it will reflect in your practice.

6)Make a couple of close friends in your nursing program.  It's going to be stressful

First

1995-1996: CNA
1996-1998: EMT-B large city EMS going to Community College
1998-2004: Paramedic
2004-2008: US Army Combat Medic. Baghdad 2005-2006
2008-2010: Finished BSN
2010-Present: RN, Trauma Coordinator

All my adult life, you know, the glory seeker mentality. Always trying to be the most bad ass dude on the block so to say. No fucking Med-Surg work for me. 

At 35 years old, a complete jerk to everyone else. Left with very little social graces. I have seen every horrible thing one human can do to another, I've seen every horrible thing a human can do to themselves, and I have seen the horror of war. I have treated strangers, I have treated family members, I have treated my ""enemies"". 

I left clinical nursing (not too far along in the old nursing career...lol) about eight months ago in order to try to begin to heal my fractured soul. It has been a hard road and I have the tendency to romanticize all the things I was doing in the past. Despite the damage I have done to myself as a human being I couldn't drag myself away from the nightmare. That's how I got tangled up in the trauma department as a coordinator. 

This week I saw 2 PAs quit their jobs, and every patient be damned, as long as the department looks good to the College. So, I quit as well, and went back to in patient case management.

I met a patient today that for some reason really hit me hard. He is a man about my age who is going to die in less than a year. He was in the hospital to build up his strength so that he could use what little time he has left on this earth enjoying his family. Nothing else mattered to him. Any treatment must be focused toward building strength and stamina, who the hell wants to spend them in a hospital?

The things this man is searching for are things we all tell ourselves that we hold dear to our hearts as well. When it comes down to it though

So, would it have a huge affect on them?  As Chuck Testa says, ""NOPE""

You know what though? I do help people, and it's fucking hell.

**TLDR: Nurse that works on my unit is practicing unsafely, if she is not fired and reported to the BON by them, can I and how do I report her myself?**

There is a nurse on my unit, leaves a lot of things for the night shift that she shouldnt, etc.

Everyone has kind of been letting her slide for a while because she's going through some personal issues at home I guess. She forgets to give some meds, night shift knows to do their research before getting report from her. The list goes on, whatever, some people make mistakes and forget things.

The past couple weeks have been exponentially terrible. She literally NODS OFF during report. Repeats herself several times without remembering, doesnt check new orders during her 12 hour shift, etc. it is very frustrating, but last night just takes the cake.

in the midst of getting a shitty, it is his main issue. I ask what the deal is, Sally says a doctor was just in the room and she was waiting on the doctor to change to insulin orders before giving it. okay... When she left i immediately went in his room, rechecked sugar and gave the insulin as ordered. I had to skip his 2200 insulin because his sugar was ~100 at that time. I look in the chart and the endocrinologist had been to see the patient at 1700 and wrote an order that said ""give ordered insulin NOW, recheck sugar at 2030 and call back with results."" Pt ended up with a blood sugar of &lt;30 at midnight, had to call rapid response and give dextrose IV and monitor blood sugar q1h all night. Patient was a little confused (baseline), but he said he was so hungry and that he had not eaten anything all day. He is blind and an assist to feed

Another patient had an order for IV lasix q12h, and she said no, she hadnt seen Sally for hours, just once in the morning. WTF. I definitely didnt want to double dose the patient, so I called Sally at home and asked if she had given it, she said no, definitely not. She said she ""thought she cleared it off."" Why the fuck would you chart that you gave something you didnt give. Why would you chart it 10 hours after it was due? her response, decided to give it and closely monitor B/P and urine output all night. Pt was okay.

Backtrack to before report, she says she'll just give it since she's going in there. I hand it over and sit down and wait for report. I look in the computer and she had scanned the meds and charted that they were given at 1900. She gives me report and afterwards ~1945 I hear the IV fluids in the dilaudid room dinging so i go in with a new bag. I walk in to see Sallys cow in the room, drawers wide open, dilaudid syringe sitting on patients bedside table not given yet, antibiotic IVPB sitting on counter ungiven, pt sitting there in pain saying Sally told her she would be right back 45 minutes ago. WTF. Then Sally comes in, and says ""oh I was just going to finish up in here.""  http://i.imgur.com/CRumsLk.gif

Upon further inspection, but were still it the patients med box. One patients wife told me her husband had not been given insulin all day (it was charted that it was given), and his blood sugars were &gt;500 at both 11am and 4pm. No evidence of Md being notified (we are required to call for blood sugars over 350). She had charted that she gave him 11 units of novolog +9 units of lantus at noon and 1600, yet his 2100 blood sugar was still ~400.

Thats all I can remember right now. I wrote everything i could down, I will be putting my 2 weeks notice in. I do not want to work in an environment that allows people like this to have innocent people's lives in their hands. i do not want to live in fear of losing MY license because of her mistakes, and I dont want to spend my entire night cleaning up her mistakes anymore. 

If the hospital doesnt report her to the BON

I have spent the better part of the last 20 years in various IT positions - tech support, marketing, etc.

In Jan 2009, mostly healthy father (to whom I am an only child) suffered a brain stem bleed and multiple cerebellar infarcts. Amazingly, he was still in his right mind, though his voice was barely a whisper and his speech was slow and slurred. He had bilateral movement and strength, but was severely ataxic. He had also lost the ability to swallow.

Sadly

Two days after he was admitted to ICU, alone and afraid, I made the decision to ""save"" him when he went into respiratory arrest. Over the following days, I was hurried along the path of trach and PEG - all the while being told it would be ""more comfortable"" for him. Not once did anyone - MD, RN or even LSW - explain to me in no uncertain terms what his prognosis was. 

It was only after taking a leave of absence from my job and being bedside with him for 6 months of only mildly successful PT/OT/SLT and my own research via his medical records and Google that I realized how dire the brain damage was. At that point

As if all that wasn't enough

Following five months of steady mental and physical decline

I tried to get back to my life over the next year and a half

I decided I needed to do something that affected the bigger picture; something that made a significant difference in the lives of human beings. I reflected on my experience with my Dad and remembered many of the really wonderful RNs (and a few of the particularly terrible ones). And that

I enrolled in a 30-day STNA (Ohio) course in June 2011, so far, **I LOVE my job!** I adore my patients and I have frequent moments of inspiration from the lovely ladies (sorry, no male nurses on my unit at night right now!) that I work with.

All the nurses run to his room to check on him.

He is going for it

That rhythm? I name it V-Jack.

He finally figured out a way to get all the nurses in the room.

I catch hell for the rest of the night from the other nurses..am I gonna call the doc and tell him his patient had a 30 beat run of v-jack??

I save it for the morning and read and label his EKG strip accordingly. The doctors asks me..""What is this V-Jack??"" The other nurses can’t wait and start telling the doctor how I have inspired my patient the past 12 hours.

Now with nursing 2, not the so much on nursing care on the second test. During the 2nd psych test, I didn't pace myself during the test and that had brought me down. Now on the final, I failed by 0.7 points. I felt like shit. Still do. I'm not out of the program. I gave a shit about clinicals unlike some of my other classmates. I didn't cheat like some of them did. I looked at the test today, I did very well on the psych portion, but got a 74.7 on the med surg. I was pissed. I got outstanding reviews on my clinical evaluations, but clinicals were either pass or fail. 

I've been at the same community college for 4 years. I've made great friends in nursing
