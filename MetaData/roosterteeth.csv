I got in a fight with my girlfriend and culminated in having a emotional breakdown. Today also happened to be the day I went to Austin. After I finally gained my composure I was on my way out and saw Slaughter Lane. 

Fuck it. 

I'd never seen their office despite going to Austin at least 15 times this summer. So I decided maybe this could bring some light to my otherwise dark day. 

It did. 

I just wanted take a picture in front of the office/logo. I didn't want a tour

The person I was with told me as they took the picture that ""people were coming outside"". I turn around and see some faces I recognize

http://imgur.com/EbIb8ot.jpg 

Just in case you're wondering which one was the one who offered a picture, no matter how bad anything seems. Thank you Rooster Teeth for all you do, and all the joy you bring to me and the rest of the fan base. You guys really are the best around and you always make me realize everything will be okay, even if it's not in the form of a video. 

And thank you Miles

* Comment scores will be hidden for 24 hours.

Lately people have been upvoting comments that are positive just because they are positive and downvoting negative ones just because they're negative. Hopefully this will curb some of that.

* No screenshot/imgur posts of twitter updates

There are a few reasons for this one. First, clogging the subreddit with 10-15 images of the same thing. When you link directly to the tweet, reddit helps us filter so we don't have to worry about that. There's also a twitter bot that will post the content of the tweet for people who can't access twitter/imgur. And last, but related to the first bit, fewer duplicate posts makes things better for you guys as you're browsing the subreddit.

* We will be starting a weekly Let's Play suggestion thread. All Let's Play, Rage Quit, etc. suggestions must be posted in the weekly suggestion thread.

This clears up some clutter and makes things easier for any Achievement Hunter guys who come here wanting to see if we have any ideas. It will be regularly posted on Sunday and there will be a link to it at the top of the page where the 10 year retrospective link is now.

* Reaction gifs

Lately there's been an increase in low-effort posts. We're trying to keep the quality of the subreddit high

Reaction Gif: Any gif that broadcasts your reaction to something. Example: 
&gt; [My reaction when RvB Season 11 starts the day after I leave on a no-internet vacation](http://i.imgur.com/fkLF9.gif)

Meme: Any r/adviceanimals style post that does not contain a RoosterTeeth employee or character. That means no Good Guy Greg, Ray, Church, Tex, Joel, or anyone else at the company are still appropriate and allowed.

Image Macro: A post that uses the title as a caption, Burnie and Gavin are all fine though.
&gt; This is ok: [Gavin's First Time](http://i.imgur.com/vQe0BPq.jpg) 

&gt; and this is not: [The Man

Number Counting: Any screenshot post about number of Facebook followers, etc. I'm sure we all are very happy when they hit a milestone number and want to congratulate them, like when they broke 4 million subscribers last month, but screenshots of it are no longer allowed. When you can edit the page to say [whatever you want](http://i.imgur.com/ZY8EB8h.png) we get a flood of people who edited the page posting for the karma, and a second flood of people who got a screenshot 'close enough' to the milestone. Cards, posters and other congratulatory original content is encouraged though!

**WHAT GEOFF TELLS THE LADS**


**Goal:** The Titanic has sunk somewhere on the map. The Tower of Pimps is hidden in the wreck (it is not buried below the sea floor). Mine it and erect it at Achievement City.

**Rules:** Each Lad gets a boat

-----

**SETTING UP THE MAP (spoilers)**

The wreck is lit up with dozens of glowstone blocks and jack-o-lanters, mark the corners of the wreck. 

The Lads can mine the lanterns and glowstone and move them around as they explore. There are also potions of night vision hidden around the wreck. These potions turn the darkest ocean to daylight. 

Air will be a problem. The Lads can use any method they can think of to deal with this challenge

The hazards are varied. In addition to the potions of night vision there will be potions of poison. Some parts of the wreck are still intact (rooms with chandeliers, chests loaded with treasure and weapons. ",,False,self,t5_2s7g9,False,niced,

Burnie, some guy decides to throw a shoe square at his chest as he is filming.

Now I get this is a homage to Kung Shu

That sort of thing (Kung Shu, and think it's okay. Luckily, Gavin just laughed it off and kept filming. For such a vulgar comedic group of people, the RT staff really go out of their way to appease fans...even the ones who act like dickheads. If that isn't class, I don't know what is.

So that's just my two cents. 
My respect for every member of Roosterteeth has increased tenfold
and screw any fan that does this sort of thing.

A lot of fans watch every single LP that comes out of the Rooster Teeth channel. You know when a video comes up from the letsplay channel

After watching the Tony Hawk LP, and honestly overall not worth watching. It made me start to doubt the videos they would release in the future. They hold onto the ones that are not funny, because they want you to think 

New Achievement Hunter Let's Play = Worth watching.

I for one will click on a new LP, and ""top"" enough to keep me interested through out the whole video. Without thinking about the game, or the people involved, it WILL be funny. Once they start to put out videos that are only ""Okay"", You will no longer be enticed to watch a new LP video, simply because it's a new video. The fact that they keep the sub-par stuff out, and only use good footage is a testament to how they are trying to please us, just because it's not up to standards. They don't just put it out to you because you'll watch it mindlessly. Unlike other YouTubers. **It's a HUGE compliment to their fans.**

The more you ask them to put out the sub-par LP's the more likely you will watch it



**TL;DR**: Stop asking for LP's that they think suck. You'll start to think they are not that funny,False,self,t5_2s7g9,False,,,t3_1fqtlh

1375428802.0,1jjwa9,Why you shouldn't change your life goal to work at Rooster Teeth.,hungryhungry-hipster,342,51,119,"So basically, which makes absolutely no sense with CS. 

Obviously that subconscious reason is probably because I want to work at RT, because they worked for it, as opposed to the high school freshman that changed their life path to work there. The person that wants to work in film, regardless of if it's Rooster Teeth or any other production studio, is a person that actually cares about their major. A person that only wants to work at RT, but not any other production studio, is not. If you want to meet them and hang out with them for a bit

So this isn't written to be a discouragement, you shouldn't be doing it as a career. Stick with your original goal before you made it (unless it's to work for a production studio, then I guess you're good)! I probably wrote this more for myself so I can visually see myself give up the unrealistic goal of working there, but I suppose it might apply to other people too.

Bunce- A bunce is often a light tap or a hit just strong enough to knock another person off of where 
they were. (Sometimes can be administered for being a cheeky little boy)


Glack or Getting Glacked- Getting glacked is a often a result of first starting a game with a pistol although with the right weapon


Boosh- A Boosh is a very common occurrence that results in moderate damage.  A boosh is often used in conjunction with the element of surprise. A boosh can sometimes result in no damage at all.


Glaow- A Glaow is a heavy


Bip- A bip is extreme damage. A bip is a precise shot


Fucked up- Fucked up is usually used in the past tense although one can currently be getting fucked up. This one is tricky, it is usually the result of getting glacked, bipped, or booshed several times, meaning it is naturally stronger than all of them.


Absolutely Mullered- This is the top of the damage scale. If someone has been absolutely mullered it was overkill. There is no chance someone will live after being absolutely mullered.


Hope you guys found this funny. I was just bored. If you have anymore to add to the damage scale let me know and ill add it. :)

EDIT1: added Glow, Added bunce, and edited Boosh 

EDIT2: Glow changed to Glaow in order to more accurately reflect its pronunciation.

Like many of you im sure you have heard about the whole 50 Shades Of Grey thing and how its basically porn for women. Well i suggest we start some form of petition to have gavin do a ""dramatic"" reading of the book (or chapters) for the first time as a little extra at the end of a podcast or even during one of the live podcasts that Rooster Teeth are working on. 

I think it would be funny as hell having Gavino read some of the strangest parts of the book (ive heard something about anal clamps?) But i just think it would be funny to hear Gavins reactions to some of the things in the book and you never know maybe even Audible.com might want gavin to do an abridged version of the whole book series. 

Its just an idea but i think it would be kinda funny and Gavin might even learn some new words to use in the Lets Plays.
