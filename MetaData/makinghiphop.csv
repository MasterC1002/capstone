1370362039.0,1fnpi0,Brian Eno's Oblique Strategies,thefunkfunk,52,5,9,"I recently stumbled across a deck of cards titled ""Oblique Strategies"" and these things have really been helping me out recently. These are super simple thoughts that any artist or creative person (sharing in makinghiphop because y'all are my favorite tho) can use to overcome writer's block or remind yourself all of the different directions you can go. Rappers and producers alike will hopefully find some inspiring stuff here!

emphasize repetitions

abandon normal instruments

accept advice

accretion

a line has two sides

allow an easement (an easement is the abandonment of a structure)

are there sections? Consider transitions

Ask people to work against their better judgement

ask your body

assemble some of the instruments in a group and treat the group

balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle

be dirty

breathe more deeply

bridges -build -burn

cascades

change instrument roles

change nothing and continue with immaculate consistency

children's voices -speaking -singing

cluster analysis

consider different fading systems

consult other sources -promising -unpromising

convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element 

courage!

cut a vital connection

decorate

define an area as 'safe' and use it as an anchor

destroy -nothing -the most important thing

discard an axiom

disconnect from desire

discover the recipes you are using and abandon them

distorting time

do nothing for as long as possible

don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do 

don't be frightened of cliches

don't be frightened to display your talents

don't break the silence

don't stress one thing more than another

do something boring

do the washing up

do the words need changing?

do we need holes?

emphasize differences

emphasize repetitions

emphasize the flaws

faced with a choice

feedback recordings into an acoustic situation

fill every beat with something

get your neck massaged

ghost echoes

give the game away

give way to your worst impulse

go slowly all the way round the outside

honor thy error as a hidden intention

how would you have done it?

humanize something free of error

imagine the music as a moving chain or caterpillar

imagine the music as a set of disconnected events

infinitesimal gradations 

intentions -credibility of -nobility of -humility

into the impossible

is it finished?

is there something missing?

is the tuning appropriate?

just carry on

left channel

listen in total darkness

listen to the quiet voice

look at a very small object

look at the order in which you do things

look closely at the most embarrassing details and amplify them

lowest common denominator check -single beat -single note -single riff

make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame

make an exhaustive list of everything you might do and do the last thing on the list

make a sudden

mechanicalise something idiosyncratic

mute and continue

only one element of each kind

(organic) machinery

overtly resist change

put in earplugs

remember those quiet evenings

remove ambiguities and convert to specifics

remove specifics and convert to ambiguities

repetition is a form of change

reverse

short circuit (example; a man eating peas with the idea that they will improve his virility shovels them straight into his lap)

shut the door and listen from outside

simple subtraction

spectrum analysis

take a break

take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance

tape your mouth

the inconsistency principle

the tape is now the music

think of the radio

tidy up

trust in the you of now

turn it upside down

twist the spine

use an old idea

use an unacceptable color

use fewer notes

use filters

use 'unqualified' people

water

what are you really thinking about just now? incorporate

what is the reality of the situation?

what mistakes did you make last time?

what would your closest friend do?

what wouldn't you do?

work at a different speed

you are an engineer

you can only make one dot at a time

you don't have to be ashamed of using your own ideas

If you are just starting to make music, because this is a perfect place for new musicians to post their music, but I guess I just want people to understand that you don't have to ""make it"" today.



Everyone is always quick to give out the advice, rap is not a gift, it's a skill that takes years to perfect. You will most likely struggle, and be incredibly frustrated by the fact that you can't make things the way you want to, but that is all part of it. Eventually it'll start clicking and things will sound more and more how you want them to.  


Take the time to study rappers, and the hope is that eventually you'll know when its time to take the next step. 

Last, and you are no different. You need to come to terms with this. Although it is a possibility, imo you should focus on the journey. That's the fun part.

So before i rattle off some solutions, and want to hear more real talk.  

Here's some ideas

Make a tag that spells out what type of feedback you want (e.g. ""Keep it positive."" or ""Trying to get better

Require people to leave a comment if they give a down vote, etc.) but there should always be a reason behind it that is better than ""i want my submission to be above yours.""

Lastly, and people aren't tempted to selfishly down vote a submission just to increase their own prospects.  

Anyway

Edit:
TL;DR
Does the feedback suck because:

a) People want to give good feedback but are scared of hurting people's feelings?

b) People want to give good feedback but are scared that if they do

c) The feedback doesn't actually suck,False,,t5_2sqw4,1374691289.0,,,t3_1iyvig

1364074482.0,1avore,Some tips for the Emcees/Producers who record. ,NewAccts,33,3,9,"After mixing the 24 hour cypher last night

I'm not criticizing the quality of the tracks at all. Not everyone has money to throw around on $500 microphones. People will use what they have. But there are some things you can do to make the quality of the recording better. Like it or not

For people who are actually interested in the science behind this. Here is a [2010 Study by Earl Vickers of STMicroelectronics](http://www.sfxmachine.com/docs/loudnesswar/loudness_war.pdf). This paper was explained at the 2010 Audio Engineering Society (AES) Convention. 

&gt;Physical fatigue
mechanical cochlear fatigue and neural or biochemical 
cochlear fatigue. Keeping in mind that loudness (a 
perceptual phenomenon) and intensity (a physical 
phenomenon) are not perfectly correlated
suggested that mechanical cochlear fatigue may be due 
to high intensity
correlate to intensity. [59]
High loudness
cells to depolarize
biochemical fatigue. In addition
firing rate is largely proportional to loudness (not 
intensity)
Johnston mentioned that listening to something that 
sounds harsh
want to run screaming in a few minutes; it’s not clear whether this is a physiological or intellectual process 
[59]. In a comparison of various loudspeakers
noticed that more distortion components can give 
speakers a fuller
fatigue and “wear the ears out sooner” [49].

The point being. Even if people themselves don't realize it

Most people who make music don't really realize this

There are two types of compression. Dynamic Range Compression and Audio Compression. 

**Audio Compression** is what most people who listen are familiar with. This is really different compression algorithms for making file sizes smaller. 

MP3s are an example of this. MP3s compress the lossless audio (.wav) so that the file sizes can be smaller but keep as much information as possible.

This is why a .wav file of a vocal track can be 60mb. But an mp3 can be 12mb. MP3 can compress the size and how much information is kept is related to file size and quality. An MP3 320 kb/s (kilobits per second) will sound better than a MP3 128 kb/s because the 320 is processing more information per second. 

MP3 128 kb/s is equal to radio quality (If I remember right). MP3 320 kb/s is pretty much equal to CD quality. So thats something to remember when you're rendering and saving your tracks. 

Since most people use Soundcloud


**Dynamic Range Compression** is what most people are familiar with when they make/record/mix music. 

The Wikipedia definition is 

&gt;Dynamic range compression

For a simpler idea. Check [this post from /r/wearethemusicmakers that is basically an Explain Like I'm 5 post](http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/1aivub/can_someone_please_explain_compression_like_i_am_5/c8xvud2)

If that isn't good enough. Youtube is full of videos of people explaining things like this and showing examples. 

Most DAWs come with a compressor in the effects list. So pretty much everyone should be familiar with what they look like.

So the first tip. 

If you don't know what Compression is

Don't throw it on your track just because other people do it. Take the time to sit down and read and learn what it is and when you should be using it. 

There is nothing wrong with compression. Heavy compression is a staple of hip hop, and not overdoing it will make your tracks a lot better. 

Tip two for vocals. Read this link

http://audio.tutsplus.com/tutorials/recording/how-to-record-vocals-in-a-bedroom/

Recording vocals is a big issue with home recording. If you're not in an isolation booth with a good microphone

Depending on where you're recording

A reflection filter is a good thing to use. It will dampen the sound in the area facing you while you record. [Here is a picture](http://www.inta-audio.com/images/products/medium/1282810601-04367200.jpg)

If you have the money to buy one. Great. If not

Shop around. Read reviews. See what people say about different brands and check prices on different thickness of foam. 

A Pop Filter is also a good idea. If you say the word **P**arachute

[You can find youtube videos for creating your own for just a few dollars](https://www.youtube.com/results?q=make+your+own+pop+filter&amp;aq=f&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=w1). Really all you need is a round apparatus and women's nylons for a really cheap filter. 

So that covers the areas where you're facing and recording. A lot of people forget about behind the head. Sound may be directed at one direction, corners). This is why people typically get a fairly reverbed track when they don't record in a treated room. 

Heavy blankets are actually a very cheap and easy way to dampen this. It won't get rid of it, over windows, under the seals of doors, and especially on the floor if you have a tiled floor (that isnt carpet). It's a surprisingly cheap way to reduce the dramatic reflections a room will give off when recording. It's also good for the room you plan on mixing in if you're using near field monitors. 

Here's another link for explaining this 

http://audio.tutsplus.com/articles/general/soundproofing-and-acoustic-treatment-for-home-studios/

Those are just a few things. If anyone does decide to read this. Check the links. Read other websites. A few cheap and simple methods can really up the quality of your recordings.

This is not a bashing
One really important thing with recording vocals is compression

Google where you can find the compressor in your DAW.
Now there are 4 parameters that you can change on the compressor:

* Threshold: At what dB do you want the compressor to kick in. -This will depend on the source.

* Attack: How fast the compression will kick in after reaching the threshold. -Faster settings for a more noticeable compression

* Release: How fast the compressor will let go once below the threshold. - Most compressors will have a ""AUTO"" mode

* Ratio: -Higher setting for a more noticeable compression

The mic is your weapon of choice
Remember that this isn´t rules

You accent the beat, and then the high hats following suite. It's like the musical Plessy v. Fergussion. Listen to Andre 3000 and notice how he rhymes on the 3 instead of the 4, on top of just making his voice follow the drums. 

That's a very broad question. I mean you could say anybody here needs tons of work. What you need to focus on is keeping your flow consistent and making sure your lines are even and rhyme.

Honestly

Not just reading but rapping. It's basically like working out. When a body builder is trying to grow and bulk up
You gotta work not just your mental muscle but your mouth

When I write a verse

Reflection is one of the greatest tools we have for improving.

If you enjoy rapping then keep writing. If I quit every time somebody told me my shit was wack i'd still suck at spitting. The more time you put into the art the more natural it will become to do all those things. The majority of these things (Flow Cadence Rhyme Schemes Compelling Content Vocal Inflections) come with time. Right now you need to focus on actually rhyming when you rap. 

If you start out a line
Work on having an ending rhyme every two bars at least.

Then once you have a verse written, 16 bars, go over that shit like a vagillion times. Yeah I said it. A VAGILLION. Then once you feel like erasing every word you wrote from your memory and never spitting another verse, that's when you will start to get better. 
But don't quit rapping because some dude on the internet told you you're bad. Especially if he is a self proclaimed ""Dope Ass Nigga"".

Most of it in my first post. If that was you rapping you really

Flow Cadence Rhyme Schemes Compelling Content Vocal Inflections

I don't think you had any of these working for you. 

The key to flowing. Rule #1 you have to feel it with or without the track. Since real free-styling is off the top and sporadic

Get dozens of instrumentals (slow
	
as i tell people all the time just experiment, you don't even have to make sense of what you say just try spitting fast then slow try different accents, lower and higher the pitch in your voice but i won't get into it extremely don't have a whole lot of time on my hands got some rhymes to work on myself so check out this article i found for one of my friends the last time i was busy lmao it really helped him and it will elaborate on what i have said above!

Reply: What's up and thanks for getting in touch. Condfidence is number one when it comes to improving delivery. It's amazing how far that little concept goes. My man J. River was shooting the video for a song of his today and you should see how he commanded attention out there on the street with cars going by and everything. He wasn't phased by it

KNOW how good you are (even if you have doubts). Visualize who you want to be and then embody that image. I don't mean be fake by any means. But obviously if you want to stop ""sounding like a little girl"" you are going to need to change something. A successful and beneficial change begins with the confidence that you can make that change. 

My point is this. If you are going to use phrases like ""sweet rhymes"" (in the way I imagine you saying it) and then expect it to sound hard on the mic...it's not going to happen. That's because you've grown acustomed to behaving completely different than what you are envisioning in your head. In your head you're envisioning other rappers voices using your lyrics...at least to some degree, you're on a great start. 

Also, some people don't realize that and rap low into the mic. That is a tell tale sign of an amateur. 

Practice your favorite male and female MC's rhymes in your own voice. If there's something about your voice or flow you don't like (for example you sound like a child), speed it up a little and add your own words in, slow it down and cut out some words, sing and then go back to rapping, play around with this for a while and don't be embarrased. The goal is to be comfortable flowing to a rhythm. Even if you're not saying anything that makes sense, take some intstrumentals with you on a car ride, find the beat, ""dadada doh

... it doesn't matter what you say, you don't use any, then it's going to hamper your delivery and you'll sound more like you're talking rhymes and not rapping them. 

If you already have decent rhymes then you are ahead of many people who visit the site. However
Another thing, DMX, etc. in our Videos Section) For others its nearly impossible. Usually, if this is hard for you, you might have to work on your rhythm. If you don't really FEEL a beat's rhythm and get in tune with it as the hungry artist that you should be...then you'll tend to resort to rhyming in the manner you talk...and in your case, you don't want that. 

It's cute that you admit to talking like a little girl

I was envisioning something like this (although all suggestions are welcome): once a week, or pretty much anyone really) on this subreddit could pick a beat and try rapping over it, submitting it to the thread. The producer could, depending on his level of interest/commitment:

a). Just pick the best freestyles over his beats and set them in order to make an EP

b). Get sent the vocal recordings by each rapper who participated and master them into a rough EP

c). Listen to each of the rappers' flows

Regardless of how seriously the producer wants to take it

So 2 weeks down the road I get an email, the email is the guy telling me about the track, it turns out it got over 12000 views and 212 likes in one night. I was skeptical so i looked at these likes and it was all bot accounts, no real ones besides for a couple. I asked him about it and he told me about his ""cuz"" who can market real well. The guy keeps asking me to use my beats and i tell him no and he does it anyways, I just got an email saying the track with my beat on it is complete and that hes going to send it to me soon.

1). **Voting on Submissions:** I don't want to get rid of the downvote button on links, they probably put effort into it. If you don't like something, fair enough, but on the whole, don't downvote. There aren't enough readers for it to matter, anyway (what's the most upvotes a link will get? Maybe 10?), and I don't want to discourage people from submitting.

So if you dig something, then don't. But I don't really see the point in downvoting unless someone is clearly trolling.

2). **Criticism:** Let me make one thing clear: the entire reason this subreddit was created is to encourage people to create their own music

Constructive criticism is definitely encouraged, this kinda sucks,"" or ""Sorry dude, don't quit your day job."" These comments are utterly useless and have no reason to exist - this isn't r/whydoesmymusicsuck. If I do see someone leaving a comment along these lines, I'll warn you. Then, I'll ban you. **This is the only bannable offense in this subreddit.** If you're being a douche and adding nothing to the community with your comments, then, but you're gone.

Hopefully I won't have to do this, then most of the other hip-hop subreddits are more than happy to let you critique to your heart's content.

2a). **What Makes Criticism Constructive.** Obviously I'm not going to ban anyone for being tactless

""I really like the beat on this song

*Good constructive criticism*: ""I think your lyrics are a little one-note, which might make your flow a little harder-hitting.""

Don't forget, but this isn't really about your opinions on the music. It's about helping people improve, so try to only comment with helpful things.

- People will PM me their submissions. It's Thursday at 8pm. Deadline is Sunday at 8pm EST. If you PM your submission at 8:01EST

- Voting will go from Sunday night (after Breaking Bad) and will end Wednesday night at 8pm EST.  

- All the submissions in the voting thread will be nameless. I'll make an account on Soundcloud and upload all the submissions. There will be no order to how I upload them. You might be the last to PM me and the first to be uploaded. 

- If Soundcloud is giving any problems. I'll upload the submissions to a different site.

- Submissions will be named Submission #1

- I can't force everyone to listen to every submission

1372601253.0,1hd51h,[Free Ableton Preset] Here's my Ableton DrumRack sampling preset for you guys.,birocratic,24,3,5,"Hey guys

* First

* Import an audio file into Ableton that you intend to sample. While we're at it

* How you choose to ""chop"" it up is your call. I always warp the file and then go transient mark to transient mark and create warp markers where I want to chop it. To listen to each slice I find it's easiest to set Global Quantization to None (command + 0) so that I can play (when the little speaker icon shows up in the Clip View) from each transient mark and hear how the sample will start. So I add a bunch of warp markers where I want to chop it

* This is where the preset comes in: when you're done chopping

* This will map all the individual slices to Simpler chains in a new DrumRack track. They're all set to the same choke group and have a release of 60s

So that's just the basics. I also included mappings to the macro controls

* 1: Velocity controls how much the MIDI velocity of triggered notes affects the volume of each sample. Choose 0% if you don't want velocity to affect the volume

* 2 &amp; 3: Attack and Release settings control the onset and decay of each sample. These should be left as is for the most intuitive, after the key or pad is released, for the set amount of time. The default long release ensures that each sample will play until the next is triggered.

* 4 &amp; 8: Transpose and Detune control the pitch of each sample. Transpose is essentially a coarse measurement in semitones from -12 to +12. Detune is a fine control that is measured in cents (100th's of a semitone) and can be controlled from -50c to +50c. Note that pitch is directly correlated to time in this preset

* 5 &amp; 6: Filter Freq and Filter On control the individual filters for all samples. Honestly, and then I unmap every other sample from this macro. Then I have control over the filter parameters for those few samples. *Note:* Filter On is a weird control: values 0-63 are Off, 64-127 are On. Just a function of how MIDI works.

* 7: Spread somewhat controls the stereo width of a sample. By default it's set to zero, but it can really be overdone. Use this control VERY sparingly unless you know what you're doing - you can really ruin mono-compatibility through abuse of the Spread control.

So that's it guys. I understand this explanation may have been a bit more advanced for some of you,,False,,t5_2sqw4,False,,True

THEN all producer interested would make a beat incorporating that sample and submit at the end of the two week period and the community will vote on the beat that they think is the best or makes the best use of the sample.

YOU ARE REQUIRED TO LISTEN TO EVERY SINGLE ENTRY. THAT'S WHY VOTING LASTS TWO DAYS. most of us listen to at least some of the entries as they are posted, this is a lot of entries. if next week is similarly bumrushed, we will try one of two things: bring back the concurrent and staggered flip challenge, which will definitely cut down on entries into each, or shorten the submission period to 4 days. if we do something like that, we may vote to decide, but will not over think this and consider a whole bunch of suggestions.

So lately i have found myself listening to a lot of music and I really want to make beats but I'm having trouble starting.

I'm using ableton and slowly I am learning the interface and I can get around pretty well but making actual music is difficult. For instance I can make okay drums and an okay melody(?) with a synth but they don't ever fit together. I don't really know anything about music and whenever I look for tutorials they seem to be about something really specific but without understanding basics I have trouble following them. 

Are there any particularly decent tutorials you know of that will help a beginner?

Is there any music theory I should learn?

Is there a good book I can read? (this is really the best way for me to learn)

I'm guessing that over time I will develop a feel for what sounds good after tons of trial and error but I need some help along the way.

So we need to pick a theme. A few of us discussed Summer as a general theme, and try to paint your favourite moment when you're beat making.

That's not set in stone though

As for the logistics. Below I've posted a table of Rappers

I need rappers and beatmakers to speak to each other, the time frame is roughly a month. I'll make another post with the hard deadline when all the pairings are worked out.

If a beatmaker wants to make a posse cut, that's cool with me.

I'd like to shoot for a maximum of about 15 songs, or we can vote on keeping them all.

As for Producers. I'll need your help doing some base level mixing on some of these tracks. I'd like to mix the whole thing myself, please raise it here.

I can finally deliver something that I hope everyone can enjoy on some level. I've had a shitty day so I decided to not wait and just get it out there.  
I remember sitting down and making each of these tracks. I've really poured my heart and soul into this project. They all took time and none of them are rushed out
The lead track is what inspired me and gave me confidence that I could mix my sampling and instrumentation together into a ambient mess of sounds.  
I'll take the chance to thank anyone that has given me feedback on any of these tracks when they were a work in progress. I hope that you can hear that I took it in and improved the final track.

This is not a bashing

One really important thing with recording vocals is compression

Google where you can find the compressor in your DAW.

Now there are 4 parameters that you can change on the compressor:

Threshold: At what dB do you want the compressor to kick in.
-This will depend on the source.

Attack: How fast the compression will kick in after reaching the threshold.
-Faster settings for a more noticeable compression

Release: How fast the compressor will let go once below the threshold.
- Most compressors will have a ""AUTO"" mode

Ratio:
-Higher setting for a more noticeable compression

The mic is your weapon of choice

Remember that this isn´t rules

This is just an idea, whatever. All of the people posting their songs who aren't really looking for feedback would still get to share their music and it would kind of clean up the front page.

original:  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yYNsGhe-vFg

""touched"" version:  https://soundcloud.com/badtouch/lifetime-novox-1

so first of all, the vocals have to be placed dead center of the mix, and there has to be other elements that are pushed left or right, if not hardpanned completely to one side.  the guaranteed downside is that the result with be mono, and any element that you might want to keep that is also dead center will be removed.

so here's what this is:  drag the original track into a DAW or editor and break it into separate left and right mono channels. take either side and invert the waveform. place both the left and right channels in the center of the soundfield, but the bulk of the vocals (and most likely bass, kick, and snare) will be eliminated.

i made the technique demo downloadable

So we've had a lot of interest in another collaborative mixtape. I'm going to start taking names now. We're looking for both beatmakers and rappers.

Mixtape Sign Up Process

1. Post a link to your material
2. Go through other people's material
3. Contact them through either reddit
4. Notify us of your collaboration by posting the details here.

I'll keep a table in this area listing all the people looking to take part. I'll also maintain a second table of collaborations.

Let's try to do this in a month. So we'll set a date for July 6th. I'll update everyone a few times over the month so people can report on their progress.

So this week the game is ""hig pig"" (if this goes well I plan on picking 4 or 5 games so that they could be cycled throughout the month) 

How it works: It’s a word game that asks you to solve a riddle. The answers are two rhyming one-syllable words.

Simply announce your hig pig clues to the other players as quickly as you can make them up. When someone guesses an answer

Since we aren't playing this in person

Since this is the first round I will begin;
What is the hig pig for sugary candies?

Pretty happy with the turnout. We got some dope stuff on here. Almost everybody who sent a track in wanted me to review their music. I'm not really interested in writing out full reviews for every song that gets sent in

Most Professional Sound - This is awarded to whoever I feel sends in the most professional sounding content.
Most Replays  - Given to whoever gets the most plays in my iTunes for the current week.
Most Room For Improvement - This is given to whoever has the most work to do to get where they should be.

*DISCLAIMER* These are my personal opinions and in no way should you take them to heart. This is merely a scapegoat i'm using to avoid having to write long reviews.

SO. 

Awards for this week go to:

**Most Professional Sound**: P64

**Most Replays**: Babaji

**Most Room For Improvement**: Cupid's Thug


Let me know If this is something you guys want to keep doing. I have the time and I don't mind managing everything. As long as people send me stuff every week I will keep posting these. Let me know if there's anything I can do to improve the format

Recently I have been working on a trap mix that was about an hour long

I finished the final touches of the mix on Thursday, and went to sleep. The next day I woke up wanting to sync the mix to my phone so I could listen to it at school all day just to get me more hype about posting it Saturday.

Once I tried turning on my computer, samplings, music, everything is now stuck in cyberhell.

Then i realized that the only copy of my mix was on there as well. Fucking bummer. 

Cried a little, than just kinda sat here for awhile until I figured I should learn from my mistake, and try and help all you guys out as well.

Buying a backup storage drive is a more important than you may think! Seriously, buy a storage drive, and if not, saving an extra copy to Dropbox or something is not a bad idea.",,False,,False,t3_1dprku

1. ""The Low End Theory"" (named after the album by A Tribe Called Quest) where you take the sample, and drop it on top of the original sample. Basically this just amplifies the original bassline of the sample. You can tweak the pitch an octave for a sub bass, too.


2. Overlaying a few sine waves (as many as you want really) and dropping the octaves to various levels until you find that nice rumble in the sub while preserving the punchiness in the speakers. Run the waveform through a compressor/fuzz to add a little warmth and crunch to it. This could take a while to get the perfect sound


3. Use a VSTi or built in virtual instrument on your DAW. Logic's Basement Bass is a notable one. Same with FL Studio's 3xOsc


4. Record an actual analogue instrument such as a bass guitar (duh), chorus, etc.) can be added to these to add spirit and authenticity to it.


I know there's tons of other methods for getting a really raw bass sound.

Do you get the concept then just write 3 verses and a hook like that? Or do you write then revise for days on end till you finally get what your looking for? 
Do you need to hear the beat your gonna rap over or do you write first then go over the beat?

I personally used to write then revise nonstop because either my lines were too corny or my syllables/flow was off. Now I'm getting the concept in my head, so I get it right the first time. It takes a helluva alot longer to come up with 16 bars but theirs barely any revision now.

Hey sorry about the late post today. I'm sick as fuck right now and my mind's working half speed. 

Really good stuff this week though. ""Tell Me"" and ""Oh ah"" have been in heavy rotation.  

Any feedback from you guys? Should we keep doing this? Any complaints? Just let me know!


EDIT:

I forgot to give a huge shout out to Sinyes for the ultra dope artwork! If anybody else wants to submit artwork feel free to send it in. As long as it fits the dimensions I'll use it.

I know there are some new people joining in on the mixtapes so let me reiterate some things:

You can submit a track every week. We've had some really dedicated artist who have been on almost every tape so far

Send all submissions to indywrecks@gmail.com with the artist name and the track title IN THE SUBJECT LINE OF THE EMAIL. This will make it way easier for me to stay organized

Finally, so don't think I'm just ignoring you specifically. I don't reply to anybody. Unless of course it pertains to an issue with their track. But I do read every email and listen to every track sent in. 

Alright

In the example below, and that squeaking at first then around :40 is where the drums come in. Does it sound like all of the drums have a low pass or low bandpass? or are they slightly pitched down? maybe both? This EQ drone or less emphasis seems to be characteristic of their sound...

and just for fun


[throw them gunz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t99r8JSdI7s)


What about this Raider Klan Phonk song. Just seems like a high pitch synth, weaker snares, and tamb's with a flanger? The tambs sound high pitch but theyre not so loud, is that compression or eq, probably both, but I like having these discussions on here as people usually drop some knowledge that I hadn't thought about.

Just some thoughts on acheiving these sounds would be appreciated. I do sampling from vinyl to look for that ""trippy"" psychedellic sound. Just looking for tips to get my cover game up. thanks

1360815413.0,18hsh7,[Discuss] Some ground rules/philosophies I apply to my rapping,,12,3,10,"1. Only write as much as you spit. Everything you write must be spit and flowed to a beat halfway decently. You can then fine tune the song from there if things are off

2. Don't be another generic rapper. There are thousands of people rapping out there, your mood at the time and make the song UNIQUE. Which leads into...

3. Don't be complaining all the time. This is the other side of the coin. Rapping too much about yourself ruins a song I think and I cannot listen to an MC dish out a life story unless its someone extremely talented with some grade A production. Anything goes here (clubs, dissing, wordplay, metaphor, etc.)

4. Don't try to sound like any mainstream rapper. Those people are just like you... individuals with their own sound, etc. They had to fight their way into the game like anyone else and anyone who becomes a famous MC deserves the fuck out of it, don't try to ""top"" them or it will sound bad....this is another thing that takes time. A style of rapping that people know you for is something honed through repetition, which leads to

5. Play to your strengths as an MC. If something comes easy to you, someone who is interested in building and racing remote control cars when they are a teenager could grow up to be a mechanic, or a machinist. Recognize your faculties and use them.


That's all

* I'm gonna put a cap of 20 beats/songs for each week.
* First 20 people to email me their tracks will get their stuff on the mixtape.
* DO NOT send me tracks you don't feel like sharing or want other people to rap over. 
* ONE track per person per week.
* Send me an email to **indywrecks@gmail.com** with your track or a link to where i can download your track. In the email include your artist name and track name. Nothing else.
* I am going to post the mixtape every Monday around noon.

There is still some stuff to work out so we will see how it goes. If I get more than 20 tracks in a week then the people who don't get on the current week will possibly be carried over to the next week. If I get waaaay backed up with tracks I will have to figure something else out.

Alright

I'd like to do a mixtape with everyone participating in the same spirit as the collaboration project but with a month time frame. I want to say straight up here, there's no money, sponsorship, or advertising involved. Just people getting together and making dope music.

So we need both beatmakers and rappers to sign up for this. If you have a beat already completed

I'll going to make an arbitrary cap at 15 tracks. Any more than that and we'll lost interest with the listener. I'm willing to bend though

As a rapper

If everyone is okay with this

If anyone has any questions. Just ask.

So we decided to come up with a new way of doing the Monday Mixtape. Our comrade jbrizzly is currently working on a website for the Mixtape and so far it is looking pretty rad.

How it will work is you guys will send me an mp3 of your track and we will post them on the new website's frontpage. You guys will be able to vote on the tracks posted right on the website

I haven't decided how many tracks will be selected but i'm guessing around 15 depending on the number of entries. This format will bring some competition into the mix and hopefully make for a higher quality tape.

We're still ironing out the kinks

that? I have heard his beats described as having an ""unfinished sound"" 

in a way. I suppose that means that the samples he uses are minimally 

tampered with

compliment the sample. I noticed that the drums in his beats don't 

seem to hit as hard as other beats

example

in the beat like in the song Orris Root Powder (posed below). Is this 

just a matter of preference to try and accentuation the drums in a 

sample you use? I would appreciate anyone who knows anything about 

his style of production to chime in. Thanks everyone.

How do the rest of you feel about how last week went in general? What was good about it? what was bad? Did we as judges do our job well or are we being too selective and strict in our selections? Should the minimum number of entries we ""aye"" be increased?

The goal of this was to ensure people would actually take in the entire voting thread and vote fairly while encouraging everyone to work harder to make better entries. I don't want people to feel like they're being deprived of listeners or a fair chance at winning so if people feel like that's happening now




**EDIT:** Thanks to all the detailed feedback so far. It really shows everyone cares about this shit and wants to see it get better. It seems like most people agree that while it's not perfect

1. Select at least 2-3 new judges if not all of them

2. Judges will hold off on making selections until after the Saturday deadline. 

3. We as judges will make more of an effort to let more non-selected entries know why they weren't selected

1356056428.0,157c1g,[Discuss] Tips EQ'ing properly,,9,0,6,"So I was going through the feedback thread and was looking for a guide I came across a while ago about properly EQ'ing different instruments to get the sounds that you want when I came across a post that [someone else made](http://www.crazypellas.net/producer-talk-107/a-guide-giving-you-frequencies-for-the-sound-you-want-when-eq-ing-53269/) and I just did some editing to make it more readable on Reddit.  Not exactly what I was looking for


**General:**

&gt;20 Hz and below - impossible to detect

&gt;60 Hz and below - sub bass (feel only)

&gt;80(-100) Hz - feel AND hear bass

&gt;100-120 Hz - the “club sound system punch” resides here

&gt;200 Hz and below - bottom

&gt;250 Hz - notch filter here can add thump to a kick drum

&gt;150-400 Hz - boxiness

&gt;200 Hz-1.5 KHz - punch

&gt;800 Hz-4 KHz - edge, defines timbre

&gt;4500 Hz - exteremly tiring to the ears

&gt;5-7 KHz - de-essing is done here

&gt;4-9 KHz - brightness, sibilance, high frequency distortion

&gt;6-15 KHz - air and presence

&gt;9-15 KHz - adding will give sparkle

**EQ Reference:**

&gt;*Frequencies*

&gt;50Hz

&gt;* Boost: To thicken up bass drums and sub-bass parts.
&gt;* Cut: Below this frequency on all vocal tracks. This should reduce the effect of any microphone ‘pops’.

&gt;70-100Hz

&gt;* Boost: For bass lines and bass drums.
&gt;* Cut: For vocals.

&gt; General:

&gt;Be wary of boosting the bass of too many tracks. Low frequency sounds are particularly vulnerable to phase cancellation between sounds of similar frequency. This can result in a net ‘cut of the bass frequencies.

&gt;200-400Hz

&gt;* Boost: To add warmth to vocals or to thicken a guitar sound.
&gt;* Cut: To bring more clarity to vocals or to thin cymbals and higher frequency percussion.
&gt;* Boost or Cut: to control the ‘woody’ sound of a snare.

&gt;400-800Hz

&gt;* Boost: To add warmth to toms.
&gt;* Boost or Cut: To control bass clarity

&gt;General: In can be worthwhile applying cut to some of the instruments in the mix to bring more clarity to the bass within the overall mix.

&gt;800Hz-1KHz
&gt;* Boost: To thicken vocal tracks. At 1 KHz apply boost to add a knock to a bass drum.

&gt;1-3KHz

&gt;* Boost: To make a piano more aggressive. Applying boost between 1KHz and 5KHz will also make guitars and basslines more cutting.
&gt;* Cut: Apply cut between 2 KHz and 3KHz to smooth a harsh sounding vocal part.

&gt;General: This frequency range is often used to make instruments stand out in a mix.

&gt;3-6KHz

&gt;* Boost: For a more ‘plucked’ sounding bass part. Apply boost at around 6KHz to add some definition to vocal parts and distorted guitars.
&gt;* Cut: Apply cut at about 3KHz to remove the hard edge of piercing vocals. Apply cut between 5KHZ and 6KHz to dull down some parts in a mix.

&gt;6-10KHz

&gt;* Boost: To sweeten vocals. The higher the frequency you boost the more ‘airy/breathy’ the result will be. Also boost to add definition to the sound of acoustic guitars or to add edge to synth sounds or strings or to enhance the sound of a variety of percussion sounds. 

&gt;For example boost this range to:
&gt;Bring out cymbals. Add ring to a snare. Add edge to a bass drum.

&gt;10-16KHz

&gt;* Boost: To make vocals more ‘airy’ or for crisp cymbals and percussion. 

&gt;* Also boost this frequency to add sparkle to pads

**Individual Instruments

**Kicks:**

&gt;* 60Hz with a Q of 1.4 — Add fullness to kicks.

&gt;* 5Khz with a Q of 2.8 — Adds attack to Kicks

&gt;* bottom (60 - 80 Hz)

&gt;* slap (4 kHz)

&gt;* EQ - Cut below 80Hz to remove rumble
&gt;* Boost between 80 -125 Hz for bass
&gt;* Boost between 3 - 5kHz to get the slap

&gt;* Processing - Compression 4:1/6:1 slow attack med release.

&gt;* Reverb:Tight room reverb (0.1-0.2ms)

**Snares:**

&gt;* 200Hz - 250Hz with a Q of 1.4 — Adds wood to snares

&gt;* 3Khz with a Q of 1.4 — Adds attack to snare.

&gt;* 7Khz with a Q of 2.8 — Adds Sharpness to snares and percussion

&gt;* fatness at 120-240Hz

&gt;* boing at 400Hz

&gt;* crispness at 5kHz

&gt;* snap at 10kHz

&gt;* fatness (240 Hz)

&gt;* EQ - Boost above 2kHz for that crisp edge
&gt;* Cut at 1kHz to get rid of the sharp peak
&gt;* Boost at 125Hz for a full snare sound
Cut at 80Hz to remove rumble

&gt;* Processing - Compression 4:1 slow attack med release.

&gt;* Reverb: Tight room reverb (0.1-0.2ms)

**Vocals**

&gt;* Fullness at 120 Hz, sibilance at 7.5 - 10 kHz

&gt;* General: Roll off below 60Hz using a High Pass Filter. This range is unlikely to contain anything useful

&gt;* Treat Harsh Vocals: To soften vocals apply cut in a narrow bandwidth somewhere in the 2.5KHz to 4KHz range.

&gt;* Get An Open Sound: Apply a gentle boost above 6KHz using a shelving filter.

&gt;* Get Brightness

&gt;* Get Smoothness: Apply some cut in a narrow band in the 1KHz to 2KHz range.

&gt;* Bring Out The Bass: Apply some boost in a reasonably narrow band somewhere in the 200Hz to 600Hz range.

&gt;* Radio Vocal Effect: Apply some cut at the High Frequencies

&gt;* Telephone Effect: Apply lots of compression pre EQ

**Hats:**

&gt;* 10Khz with a Q of 1.0 — Adds brightness to hats and cymbals

&gt;* Hi Hat &amp; Cymbals: sizzle (7.5 - 10 kHz)

&gt;* EQ - Boost above 5kHz for sharp sparkle

&gt;* Cut at 1kHz to remove jangling

&gt;* Processing - Compression use high ratio for high energy feel
&gt;* Reverb: Looser than Bass n Snare allow the hats and especially the Rides to ring a little
&gt;* Get Definition: Roll off everything below 600Hz using a High Pass Filter.

So I promised a few of you that I would post the stats from the Monday Mixtape a while ago. I figured now would be a good time to do it. Here are the top 10 plays and top ten downloads since we started 10 weeks ago.

[Top 10 Plays](http://i.imgur.com/GmeTN.png)
[Top 10 Downloads](http://i.imgur.com/I7nmY.png)

So print those off and post em on the fridge at home or do whatever you weirdos would do with shit like this. It is pretty interesting to see the trend in plays i guess. 

Anyways i wanted to remind you to send in your tracks for this week before midnight Sunday

I actually have no idea how to do anything yet so give me a week to figure everything out AND THEN I'll be modding shit left and right. I might even change my name to Modney King
