It's about time I think. The last AMA I did was over a year ago and it was mostly Starcraft focused. I'm here to answer your questions today. After the AMA is done

It is AMAA (Ask me Almost Anything) because I will not talk about my income. Partners generally don't do that because people get weird around money and the networks we are partnered with encourage us not to talk about it, within reason.

Ask away.

1351487128.0,129ed3,The new show will be called Content Patch,,475,91,85,"After over a week of trying to think of a decent name, it's got some cool connotations.

1) It's game-related and instantly identifiable by enthusiasts

2) It's got the whole ""nicotine patch""

3) It's where the content comes from, along with the lettuce.

4) It's descriptive of what the show is

Format-wise it's pretty straight forward. Nothing fancy

I've taken some lessons from Azeroth Daily, we put together a layout that will look slick and high quality but also provide plenty of video-assets to accompany the stories where available. OCRemix music will provide the background bed, since I very much liked the idea of putting music in the background a'la Azeroth Daily and my older podcasts.

This is a proof-of-concept layout that Zooc put together for the show - http://imgur.com/k8h8K This is bare-bones

I'm hoping this show will have some nice cross-appeal. It'll be current and interesting as was The Mailbox but with less reliance on user-submitted content. It seems like a win/win for everyone. 

The show will air Monday-Friday as the Mailbox did and we're shooting for 15 minute episodes. I'm also looking into having Zooc host it while I'm unavailable so we don't have huge content gaps like The Mailbox did. It makes more sense with this format since delivering the news is something you can do with relative neutrality whereas Mailbox lived or died on the basis of my opinions.

It's been a good run. Thanks to those who followed the Mailbox. The audience for that show doubled during it's run,,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,True

Radio engineer here.  We've spoken a few times over twitter, the RE20 has delivered the sound I've needed.  As a bonus, it's built to a fairly tough standard, making it resistant to the abuse dished out by drunken and overzealous college kids.

I noticed you've had some trouble getting your audio interface to play nice with the EV.  I'm not sure what model it is, hidden behind acrylic rack covers so the $%&amp;*  college students don't futz with the controls.)  Speaking of controls, upon an initial glance, the 528E might appear to be overly complex and intimidating to set up.  It's not a consumer product, but I can assure you that an engineering degree is not a prerequisite to operating one.  The most important thing to have is a working pair of ears.  [This site](http://support.symetrix.co/s.nl/ctype.KB/it.I/id.481/KB.4372/.f) offers a crash course in setting up the 528E.  My own personal preferences are a bit different, but I can say that guide is a very good place to start.

The only other major concern with the 528E is the price.  It might seem steep, the 528E is a relative bargain.  Things can get [a lot worse.](http://www.sweetwater.com/store/detail/SLAM)

I'm extremely sorry if these aren't the correct ways to contact you for this. The options were Public Relations or Business, I'm trying both, and I apologise for any problems that may cause! I'm posting my results below in text, as I was afraid you would dismiss an e-mail with a word/excel document attached.

(There was some overlap in opinions
Note: Off Topic contains not just spam, jokes, etc... but also many comments where people very vaguely guessed at why others might not be watching, instead of giving their own reason for (not) watching. e.g. ""I think kids these days just have short attention spans and so tune out quickly, but I'm not like that so I dunno really."")

Below is a more expanded account of my results:

LEGEND:


(###) - Number of people whose reason/opinion fit into this category.


[###] - A notable subset of a larger category. (Not extra data
No direct quotes - The sentences under each category are generalized paraphrases of the most common things I saw said. They are to give context/examples of what I saw (roughly in order of frequency). They do not necessarily represent my personal opinion

(Bracketed sentences are notes of mine.)


* I Just Didn’t Care for the Games (208)

* The games simply didn’t interest me/hadn’t heard of them so I didn’t click. [170]

* Too many indie games. [38] So many 2D Platformers

(NOTE: Most people made explicit they felt this was nobody/PAX’s fault

* Enjoy Convention Content – Want more (132)

(Multitude of reasons

* Uninterested in Convention Content (118)

* Simply dislike convention coverage in general

* Feel it’s all about developer sales pitches. Everyone is too agreeable over things that seem sub-par and uninteresting.

* I associate Youtube coverage of conventions with bad quality videos [4]
(Aknowledged their predjudices and gave your coverage a shot
* Interested only in your regular content [56]

Mostly WTF is... and Content Patch (Lots of overlap)
Some Starcraft/Terraria/Blood Bowl
Not necessarily anti-convention coverage


* Games are too far from Release (105)
Dislike hearing about games that aren’t done/releasing quite soon [82]
Recent game scandals have made early-promises and hype into painful concepts – Developer says the game is good? Well


(NOTE: Just scandals such as Aliens: CA, and their misleading advertisement/failure to deliver.)
If alpha-presentation is ""not indicative of the final product""


New Indie games come out every week – I’d rather know about them as I can play them right now. I’ll forget everything about your unfinished game even a month from now – it’s simply not relevant yet.


(One person suggested: ) Inverse proportional video length – the farther away the release date


* Specifically enjoy seeing early coverage [15]

* Only look up what’s currently on Steam [8]

* Lack of Criticism in the Journalism Format (100)

I come to this channel because of TB's ability and willingness to give honest, which is missing in convention coverage.

I come for your opinion

TB’s interaction with developers feels too disingenuous – over-politeness for the developer’s sake robs the footage of what makes TB’s content unique.

You can give criticism/feedback on pre-alpha games while still forgiving alpha-bugs – art direction, use of QTEs, apparent design flaws, etc... Give us raw opinion in a way that makes this coverage your coverage. Something that wont insult the developers, but help them.

It just feels like a large commercial.

(This tied in a lot with Developer Presence)

* Youtube Problems (64)

Your videos didn't show up in my feed.
Youtube’s confusing new layout impossible to navigate!
I didn't realise I had been auto-unsubscribed from your channel...

* Too Busy to follow Content (60)

(In order of frequency:) Easter Holidays with family, was at PAX myself, etc...

* Opinions on Developer Co-Commentary (49)

* Developer commentary is bad [36]

Their mere presence changes TB from The Cynical Brit into Generic Polite Games Journalist.
Too eager to sell the game on buzzwords.
Too nervous
Repetitive information in attempt to always be saying something.

* Developer commentary is good [13]

Interesting insight into developer mindset you don't otherwise get.
Generally enjoyable to hear.

* Your Convention Coverage is still of less quality to your usual standards (38)

* Unavoidable crowd noises are off-putting [29]

It's not your fault
I like to listen to your videos while I do other things
English isn’t my first language and sadly the crowd makes it impossible to understand at times. (At least two people said this.)

* Unspecified [9]
(Not altogether helpful

* Too many videos at once (27)

My feed is flooded with your videos that I miss many of them.
I see so many videos and I feel I have to watch them all

* Suggest new approach to convention coverage (26)

Make the experience more personal!

Something only TB can provide. [9]

Walk around and have fun

Give us more of your convention experience – all the other info is available from any other outlet.

This doesn’t have to be the focus of content

After gaming go aside somewhere quiet where you can express your opinion more candidly.

While you're running a business

Show more of Gen and Zooc! (Least mentioned... &gt;.&lt; Sorry guys!)

I'd prefer summaries of convention information over individual coverage [10]

Summarise more information into armchair personal impressions videos

Do your coverage of games through Content Patch – game footage in background but more concise and focused summaries.

Do more Upcoming Schedule videos

I'd like more actual one-on-one interviews with developers

Your approach to game demos is too unstructured [2]

It's effectively like watching the first 20 minutes of a Let’s Play - usually the least entertaining bit.

Needs more structure, then look at texture quality, then lighting, etc... rather than just letting things come to mind.

* Your Channel's Presentation of the Videos confused me (22)

Lack of ‘WTF is...’ branding [14]

Hard to distinguish your content from the other videos in my Feed
What happened to “WTF is... PAX Edition!”?

* The new thumbnails were confusing for the same reason - I didn't recognise your content. [8]

* Uninterested in PAX (East) Specifically (19)

I'm not against convention content

I don’t understand why you would cover PAX...?

(The way these were said sorta felt like they were unaware that TB thinks that PAX is more impressive than E3 for games coverage.)

* Conventions are over-reported already (14)

My feed was absolutely flooded by all my subscriptions – I gave up following it.

Without your personal flair, other Youtube channels, etc...)

* Video length (13)

Too long for not saying much... I just don’t have the time. [8]

They're just the right length

Some seem so short... It looks shallow in depth so I don’t click it. [2]

Claims on Youtube’s new way of calculation views (7)

Doesn’t Youtube only count people who watched the video right to the end now?
(NOTE: I noticed a lot of people saying they’d stop watching a video halfway through when they weren’t engaged by the game at hand. So many may have not reached the end

Off Topic (134): (Deleted/Not considered


Other information:

Order of breaking 100 opinions:

* First – I Just Didn’t Care for the Games

* Second – I Like Convention Content

* Third – Games are Too far from Release (Shortly after Off-Topic)

* Fourth – Lack of Criticism


Games most brought up

* Project Shield (mixed opinions – 28 mentions at 18:10 (I don’t care : I found it very interesting) )

I'd just like to take a little bit of time to express my true sympathies to both yourself and Genna for the situation that you find yourselves in at present.

To hear about people who genuinely care about their lives and professions to the extent that you both do is heartwarming. I respect you an incredible amount for how genuine you let yourself be in your presence on the web. Blowing up once in a while over twitter at the faceless mass of jealousy and entitlement is endearingly human. It's for this reason that I personally feel such a connection to you. Hell

In regards to Genna's wellbeing I can relate, it's heartbreaking to see someone you deeply care about going through something so inexplicably crushing, Having been on both sides of the fence, sometimes at the same time, I can only offer my experience and advice. If not at least know that you've made enough impact on my life for me to sincerely want to help you.

1344014780.0,xmn9z,Gamer entitlement : The Does and Don'ts,,229,23,55,"This term is stupidly overused

Gamer entitlement is a real thing, extremes, black and white. It's not ok for only some things to constitute gamer entitlement no, the entire phrase must be considered meaningless because ""lol whiteknights"" and other such nonsense. It is unfortunately indicative of the rather childish dialogue that seems to exist between vocal gamers who are really involved in the discussion for the sole purpose of upsetting other people. Media outlets are guilty of this as well, IGN went on it's now infamous rampage regarding ""gamer entitlement"", lambasting gamers for daring to criticize Mass Effect 3. The counter argument is that gaming entitlement is a myth. Neither of these are true, gamer entitlement exists, occupies a middle-ground.

Here's what in my opinion constitutes gamer entitlement vs what gamers are actually entitled to as consumers.

You are entitled to....

* The content that is on the disk when it is reasonable to do so. That means that content which is complete and functional prior to release should be included as part of the purchase price. Content that began it's development prior to release but is not in a finished state to the point where it will take significant time post-release to complete

* A functioning product. If your system is to the correct specifications and does not have significant user-created problems preventing the product from running well (ie. clogged up with bloat/malware

* A product that is properly configured for the platform it's on. This for the most part applies to PC, FoV slider (or reasonable FoV to begin with) in FPS games and a proper options menu. It can also apply to consoles, though for the most part see ""a functioning product"" above for problems that console users have (see every Bethesda game ever for PS3).

* Post-release support to the point of ensuring that any technical problems which impede the proper operation of the product are fixed with patches.

* Rebalancing where necessary in multiplayer titles to ensure an enjoyable and fair gaming experience.

------------

You are not entitled to....

* Free content updates

* Content created especially for later versions of the product on other platforms. While it makes good business sense to provide this

* Provide creative input into the title and expect it to be implemented. You are not the designer. Feedback is useful but the developers are under no obligation to use it.

* Lambast

That means for once I'm in a very unique situation of knowing almost a week in advance what videos will be coming out. I've decided to share the schedule with you on the basis that you may wish to watch these WTF is videos before purchasing the titles.

* Wednesday : WTF is Prototype 2?

* Thursday : Hyper WTF is Orcs Must Die 2 co-op with Fony/akamikeb

* Friday : WTF is Kung Fu Strike?

* Saturday - WTF is Endless Space?

* Sunday - WTF is Unmechanical?

* Monday - WTF is Adventures of Shuggy?

I am in San Francisco for 3 reasons.

* To film and compete in a charity War of the Roses tournament. My team contains Seananners, hopefully including the VOIP chat between the team. The event will be streamed live.

* To stream and compete in the ""Food Fight"", should be able to get a VoD of this.

* To visit and film at the developers of Natural Selection 2. Hoping to get a couple of videos of the game with developer commentary.

See ya next week.

There are thousands of comments on the first video alone and I only expect that to get crazier as things go on. As a result I'm going to post a thread here for each ""Viewer Remarks"" question in which people can copy-paste interesting opinions they stumble across while reading the comments section. It's half peer-review and half ""oh god help us we can't deal with this many comments"". We would really appreciate your help in this.

The upvote system of Reddit works much better than the upvote system on Youtube

There are concerns that people could exploit the system to get their own comments on the show

There has definitely been success in regards to ""taking back"" the comments section. It's an overwhelming surge of interesting opinions and discussion as opposed to the usual bitching and flaming so I'd like to continue the experiment.

This thread can now be used to post interesting opinions on the subject of ""Modern Military Shooters"". Please bear in mind that dissenting opinions are also interesting

&gt;Hello
&gt;
&gt;I'm sure many of you have realized that since this morning around 8:30 PST the absolutely wonderful http://www.youtube.com/my_subscriptions  page now redirects to the absolutely dreadful http://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions.
&gt;
&gt;For those that don't know the /My_subscriptions page had a very user-friendly and sensibly designed layout. You could easily find videos from everyone you were subscribed to without going to their channel page, quick, and made browsing your subscriptions fast and easy.
&gt;
&gt;The /feed/subscriptions page is notorious for not showing videos randomly, and directs you to a channel's page for new videos instead of a convenient list of that channel's new releases.
&gt;
&gt;I am bringing this too the attention of the Polaris Network in hopes that
&gt;
&gt;Thank you. 
&gt;
&gt;~~EDIT: It appears that after many complaints
&gt;
&gt;EDIT: It seems they (Youtube) are occasionally re-enabling the /My_Subscription then disabling it again. Hopefully they'll make up their mind and choose correctly. I don't want rely on twitter and reddit to get video updates.

1341082178.0,vumhh,How I agree with TB without being a F*&amp;^ Fanboy. ,Igloogreenhouse,129,22,37,"So I’d like to give a new viewpoint to the big controversy over some comments Totalbiscuit has said in the comments of one of his videos. Now I’ll admit I do enjoy his channel, don’t start with the line “Well you’re obviously biased.” 


The main thing that seemed to get on people’s nerves with what he said was the assertation that he didn’t care about his subscriber base. This is


My connection to this phenomena, my high school, college, and job experiences have always revolved at the fact that when people get into a “Hey, look at that” mentality, they become fucking retarded nine times out of ten. If you’re famous you get it from the mob people. If you’re different you get it. If you’re a gaming commentator you get it a thousand times over, whether you be someone like Totalbiscuit or a dude with fifty subscribers. And on youtube you get the extreme rude bullshit of internet mannerisms. I can guess that Totalbiscuit gets hate mail every day of his life, I’m sure TB gets nice comments too


But the thing is this, and anger. People have said really fucking stupid things at me, a drunk dude once said to me at a party: “Woahh! I bet your mom’s vagina is taller than Shaq!” That’s fucking terrible. I wanted to hit him in the face. Because people don’t realize how hard it is. I never get a break, it’s ALWAYS about the tallness when I meet people. Totalbiscuit obviously can lead a fairly normal life, because he might not be noticed in the average American grocery store, but that’s not the point. The point is this, he’s entitled to feel pissed when people,  he’s both being brutally honest


And it probably isn’t the best PR for his channel when he says stuff that pisses people off, doing it. Because in all honesty, it’s just giving the stupid’s of the world a taste of their own medicine. Lets them feel what it’s like to be cornered and judged. 


I’d be very interested in hearing what people think of this.

Livestreaming is something I've always liked doing, I'm not pumping out tons of LP content every day just to make money off the back of someone else's game and every now and again it's nice to sit down and share a game with the fans via the medium of livestreaming. I'm starting to regret even taking a stance on LPs to be honest, they're actually not important enough to even get concerned about, not to mention the REAL people responsible for this current nonsense aren't the people making the content but the viewers that lap it all up and demand MOAR MOAR MOAR. Hell you can argue you'd have to be an idiot NOT to make as much money as you can while that particular trend lasts. I really wanted people to just understand that you should respect the work development teams put into games and not just see them as a means to pull stupid faces, spout memes and make a bunch of money because for some reason that's what every teenager wants to watch these days. This is something that a bunch of people put years of their life into and they probably didn't envision all that work being drowned out by someone speaking in a stupid voice and screeching at random intervals because apparently that's ""funny"" now. 

I'm strongly considering bringing some LP content onto the channel, but apparently that's not enough for some people, they want control over the content you create and will shout at you if they don't get their way.

Anyway I hope you guys are enjoying the live content. Apparently you are since we had 12k concurrents on the stream for FTL

I've been playing Forge since the alpha, this game is really solid, and I'm glad TB decided to promote it. 


I've been looking for a game like this for a long time - skill based combat, but with nothing else to distract it from the pvp.


Anyways

Honestly

For those unaware of why the Europeans got screwed out of the giveaway: laws regarding giveaways and contests in Europe are a bit difficult when accepting stuff from overseas, it would have added up to 1k$ worth of shipping and processing fees if all the winners were international, about 150 for each card. 

Here's the thing: the European audience is entirely at fault for thowing a fit over this, people would still cry foul and all that other stuff, but you're always going to have insufferable loons on videos. 

I also read one of the posts that someone made on his comments page that he was just fishing for views on what is considered his least popular show. Look. If TB was really struggling with views Nvidia wouldn't have given him 6 of their best cards for a contest. This was a promotion for both them and him, but the European community ought to be ashamed of itself right now. Because of a highly vocal minority, TB is now completely discouraged from providing his fanbase with any giveaways in the future, even though he was more than happy to do so back when he had BluePlz and even before his channel became popular. 

Who knows, you were pissed that you were excluded from this current contest, but may not have been from future ones. Now, nobody gets anything. I hope you're happy.",,False,self,False,t3_1g1lgq

1353501962.0,13kauj,Regarding the ArmA developers that are captured in Greece(the other side of the argument),xNIBx,92,25,35,"I am greek

(1) The greek media dont try to spin this into ""they are turkish spies"". The greek media largely ignore the issue. They might have mentioned it once when it started but it really got no traction other than ""stupid developers try to take pictures of military installations for their game"". As usual, they would likely be turkish ones because Turkey would have made more sense to spy on Greece(though it is kinda laughable that they would spy like this but whatever). But claiming that they are turkish spies and having this published on a major greek media is absurd. At most either someone who isnt greek fabricated this out of thin air, or some nutjob greek posted this on his blog.

(2) Greece has a population of over 11 million people. 10 million tourists visit Greece each year, i can assure you that tourists photographing military installations(with intend or by accident) as well even accidentally(most of the time) trespassing military bases, is almost a daily occurrence in those islands.

The greek military just calls the police, checks their passports, they are taken to the police precinct for some routine questioning and they are left free(i dont know if they are fined) but they are never detained. The fact that these developers were detained and were also denied bail, makes this situation really interesting.

(3) If those developers just went there for vacations, casually taking a photograph of a single military installation, especially by accident, isnt enough to even get you jailed.

(4) Some might mention ""this isnt the first time that this has happened to Greece. A few years ago some plane spotters were also arrested, something similar happened. So out of the millions of tourists that come to Greece, out of the tenths of thousands of incidents where a tourist actually took a photo of a miltiary installation, this has happened twice? And it just happened that 2nd time to be the ArmA 3 developers. What a crazy coincidence. If this was happening a lot more often, there would have been a lot more stories like this, wouldnt they? And pretty much noone would even bother visiting Greece as a tourist.

(5) There isnt a single country in the world where you are allowed to take pictures of military installations. In fact on some countries, what would happen then? Local jail overfilled with illegal immigrants? Guantanamo ? Some secret egyptian prison where he could be tortured? Just putting things into perspective.

(6) And yes, everyone knows that this wont happen, so why use this kind of dramatic titles? 

(7) Remember that what you hear is the developer side of the story. Just because they claim that they just photographed a civilian airport, they wouldnt have been in the situation that they are now.

TLDR : I think the developers did many stupid things to get in the situation that they are now,False,self,t5_2tqbt,1353599820.0,,,t3_13kauj

In a little under 2 hours, he was great on the TGS E3 livestreams, seems knowledgable about the games and, in stark contrast with the guests of the last podcast, a genuinly nice guy. I guess the only concern would be him being too quiet but I am confident he will establish himself in the podcast. Hopefully, this will be a drama-free podcast.

-----

1.) I need a handful of volunteers to test&amp;fix the netcode

* Windows 7
* Microphone
* Webcam
* 'High speed' internet (roughly 1.2+ MB/s up%down
* Enough knowledge about your firewall
* Skype (necessary evil to organize tests)
* Time on sat/sun around 20:00 UTC, 13:00 PDT (so podcast time), a test shouldn't take more than 30 mins to an hour.  
* I'd prefer europeans
* A reasonable understanding of english

2.) (optional) A *netcode specialist* (you know, then you should **know**..  

* TCP/UDP (and *maybe* some of the quirks of Winsock2)
* Deep understanding of NAT traversal and UDP handshaking concepts (this is the *key part*)
* (maybe) familiar with C++
* Aside from that the requirements (aside from the time frame) apply as well or else analysing&amp;testing changes wouldn't be possible.

-----

Aside from that here are some beta 'mock up' [screenshots](http://imgur.com/a/JPSJr) and some of the 'cool' features that would improve the production value of the podcast

* true P2P netcode (most of the current quality issues are caused by shitty/overloaded skype servers
* HQ video (with modern encoding
* HQ audio (no robot voices and roughly 192 kb/s CD-quality without sacrifices)
* Inserts
* Soapbox view (one user with big window
* Stereo panning (no more stupid center channel mono
* Censoring (for comedic value or to drop names/spoilers without the audience hearing it)
  
Aside from that 'TB' convenience features..easier&amp;faster setup times

As you can see TRQ is a real thing, then this is your chance to help making the TGS podcast (or whatever it will be called) better and chances are pretty high that it will bleed over to the 'scene' (other youtubers, streamers, etc.) to make everything better (also it isn't limited to podcasts, there are profiles tailored to interviews/co-op plays etc. too).  

Thanks for your time and have a good day!

I feel that, as was said in the feedback you referred to, you can't be so critical when talking, and it also reduces the entertainment value. Not something I need to go too deep into since its all been said before.

So, E3 etc, why not have some of both in the video. I could see this in two ways:

1. For the first half of the video, like you normally would. Then for the rest of the video, you talk as you normally would after the fact, like you did for this video. In it you can reflect on the comment the dev gave, and generally review the game like you would and did here.

2. More editing and not sure how well it would work, and then back to Q&amp;A etc. This may help the 'flow' rather than splitting into two halves, but may hinder the flow as you could end up with a disjointed-sounding video. Perhaps keeping two flowing haves seperate would be better, perhaps this.

One final thing to add is that at events like PAX, but quieter. But doing a few hours of this sort of thing, after spending a day on your feet at the event, must be pretty tiring).

I have often thought that whenever TB brings in devs to the ""WTF is""-show to tell about the game themselves, but how often do the devs actually respond to the criticism and whether or not they will fix it (but mostly those are just about bugs anyway)?

The flipside is that having devs on the show really ups the value of the show and the channel. Not everyone gets to have devs themselves showcasing the games in question and TB having access to devs really puts him above the average youtuber. It also makes TBs gameplay more focused on what the game is actually about. 

I also really enjoy when the Hyper WTF is becomes more of an interview than an actual game presentation. The Day Z ""Hyper WTF is"" is probably the only one that I really liked since everyone basically already knew what the game was about and the episode was more about hearing the developers insight and also about the future of the game. I'd like to see more of those instead. 

I'd like to hear how others view the hyper wtf is content and if it's something TB should also consider changing around (now that mailbox is ending) or renaming. ",self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cynicalbrit/comments/12a5le/hyper_wtf_is_vs_normal_wtf_is/

I was wondering if you would concider doing a once a week Mailbox episode on the weekends, but limiting it to Q&amp;A about subjects brought up during that week only may help with that.

I know that I for one watched the mailbox everyday because i  genuinely liked hearing your oppinion. You seem to have a good knoledge of both the gaming industry aswell as the community and i always found it interesting to hear your imput on the questions people asked. and i know i couldnt have been the only one.

If the mailbox is dead, just when somthing big happens in the news that you feel you want to talk about, but not in the ""news reporter"" setting of the daily CP videos.

.

This post may be a bit long, and I give the reason I enjoyed the mailbox element in that the most interesting parts were not normally the news parts but instead questions about more general or less news-worthy topics. 

.

Read on for the full thing.

.

What I wanted to do was try and provide some feeback/criticism of the content patch show

.

I'd like to start off by saying I enjoy content patch (CP), questions, or comments. I feel that this is somehing that CP, or at least that I miss from CP.

.

I am hoping there could be room for more viewer generated discussion

.

I wonder if having a mailbox-esque system of viewer submitted questions or topics to hear TB's response and opinion on would be possible to have added to CP. I would envision that each show would end with just one (maybe 2 short) responses to these.

.

If there is nothing good submitted, since this would only be a 5 minute block on the end of the show. I don't know what kind of volume of spam was being recived by the old mailbox e-mail, so maybe it was just getting too much, but perhaps its worh a try. After all, the series wouldn't hinge on having good quality questions submitted as the news presses on anyway, while also possibly providing more content for less busy (news-wise) periods, since this opinion stuff would not be time-specific and good questions could be saved and used at a later time.

.

The reason I want to see this viewer-submitted content back is because I feel that the opinion and question pieces submitted to the mailbox were often the best parts of the show, third and fourth (of four) questions were not things that were news and wouldn't be covered in CP, but I found very interesting to hear your opinions about and is the kind of thing that drew me to the show and, in a way, kept me watching the channel.

.

I don't know if anyone else feels this way,False,self,t5_2tqbt,False,,,t3_160xs7

I think the problem is that a lot of TBs fans see him not just as a person who produces high quality videos for our entertainment, if not all big YouTubers and celebrities in general, tbh).

Well, he's not mine, he's not a friend to most of his 700k+ subscribers. He's a guy making videos on the internet, just because you subbed him on YT/liked him on FB/followed him on twitter/etc, that doesn't suddenly mean he's obligated to be your buddy and listen to your thoughts on any particular subject, because he's not, he's not obligated to give the slightest fuck about you.

Imagine standing on a stage and looking out at a crowd of over 700k people all trying to tell you what they want you to do/make/etc next, and you'd probably go insane if you tried.

He cares about his subscriber base as a whole, personally, are just a number, a statistic, a face in the crowd (and that isn't going to change, especially if your tactic is to hurl abuse at him or his family).

He bases his content upon statistics and view counts

There's a quote TB came out with a few times during his Blue Plz podcast

Of course its optimized for AMD cards, opposed to the green team's CUDA with is mostly closed (thats why you can run TressFX on NVidia and PhysX cant run on AMD). And in straight up general computing performance AMD cards kick NVidia (http://images.anandtech.com/graphs/graph5699/45164.png).

One more thing: Not that long ago NVidia annonced that that there will be Physx on PS4 (AMD Hardware). A long time ago you could you a low-tier NVidia card for phisics processing with an Ati for video processing. Thats gone with windows 7, but the drivers havn't been updated in years and it don't support multithreading.
