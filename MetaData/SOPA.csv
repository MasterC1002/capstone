Inspired by this recent post [""I work in news and this is how you stop SOPA""](http://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/ngd4r/i_work_in_news_this_is_how_you_stop_sopa/)

Now that the committee vote has been delayed until January
Here are some things that would help our efforts:  

* Legal and technology experts who could talk about the impact of SOPA to media
* Small business owners who would be negatively impacted by SOPA (almost anyone selling anything online, etc.
* Contacting local press directly. Here is a short blurb text that you can customize: 

---

The internet is THE job creation platform of the 21st century because it allows local small businesses and entrepreneurs to efficiently sell their goods and services across the globe. Two bills now pending in Congress—the PROTECT IP Act of 2011 (Protect IP) in the Senate and the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) in the House threaten to undermine that platform by denying business owners that use the internet the right to due process of law.

Unfortunately, and it's important that local business owners learn more about how Congress may further regulate the internet.

Here is an open letter from prominent tech entrepreneurs, Youtube, Huffington Post, Craigslist, Yahoo!, paypal, and eBay:
http://dq99alanzv66m.cloudfront.net/sopa/img/12-14-letter.pdf

Adam Savage from Mythbusters explains how SOPA could destroy the internet as we know it:
http://www.popularmechanics.com/science/mythbusters/articles/mythbuster-adam-savage-sopa-could-destroy-the-internet-as-we-know-it-6620300

1329279428.0,pq8ra,This is Why I Oppose the MPAA,capt_wink_martindale,1368,406,170,"*I apologize for the repost/edit.  I feel that I should start over and restate my earlier contribution, while further explaining some of the muddier details.*

As a film student in early 2001, making bigger and bigger projects.  For my senior thesis, I wanted to base it on a short story by Isaac Asimov, which was part of the compilation that made up the book “I, Robot”.  Isaac had died a few years previous, but after a lot of badgering to the publishers, I was finally awarded with the home phone number of his wife

I figured that the number I was given was just another publishing associate, elderly woman.  I struggled through my initial shock to explain that I was a student; I wanted to use her husband’s story as a basis for my project, and could I get her permission.  She said that it sounded like fun, and gave me the number of the estate attorney, so I could get a written form that gave me the go-ahead.  I called, I got permission, and they faxed the form to my professor’s office.

*It’s important to note that the film was based on one of Asimov’s short stories, Robot”, and barring the inclusion of the laws of robotics, was almost wholly original.* 

2 weeks later, and make a little bit of history.  **Sadly, I let them all down.**

In our last week of shooting, which mentioned that a major studio purchased the book rights to I, Robot, and planned to make a film.  Initially, I thought, “Awesome – free promotion!”  Alas, that’s not what was looming on the horizon.

Part of the project was to make posters, as to look professional.  Somehow the legal team from the studio found out about a student project, in a small private college in the Midwest, with no budget, being shot in a warehouse basement, and decided to issue a cease and desist order.  Basically, what that means, “You’re using our property.  Stop, our shooting notes

Instead of the letter recognizing our valiant efforts as students that I expected, if I chose to proceed, they would file multiple lawsuits totaling over 2 million dollars against me.  In the end, I might win, but it would take hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees just to fight it, but would cost them nothing more than the salaries they already pay their lawyers.  It would be 10 years before any type of verdict could be levied, and by then it wouldn’t matter what the outcome was

I was 22.  I was working 2 jobs, which totaled about $10,000 in debt.  I had spent my last dollar to buy breakfast for the crew on the last day of shooting.  I was properly fucked.  *I caved.*

In the end, and recognized my talent and dedication.  I graduated with honors, without ever turning in a senior thesis project.  I guess that they assumed I had learned the most valuable of all life lessons.

Looking back, they completely pulled the rug out from underneath the career that I’d been trying to carve out for myself.  Without a thesis project, I wasn’t equipped to apply to grad schools, and by the time I’d recuperated from the costs I’d incurred, I’d already been forced to accept a different career path, and rearranged my life to fit.  Don’t get me wrong, I’ve had a fairly successful career designing web sites for major entities, but I can’t help but harbor resentment for having my wings clipped so early

It’s been ten years since this all went down, I cannot.  As my wife reminded me, we have a home, careers and our livelihoods.  I’m not just putting myself in harm’s way, but her as well, and that’s not a fair sacrifice regardless of the honest intentions.  *Please note that I don't condone any illegal activity of any sort.*

My story is not unique

I’m forced to watch the studios systematically destroy the art of film.  *One download at a time.*

I defy the system in my own petty way.  *One download at a time.*

I want to watch it burn.  *One download at a time.*

Some of you saw a portion of the film clip, I might have been in violation of the original cessation order, so I had to unfortunately take it down of my own volition.  I’m forced to consider that my actions no longer affect only myself, but my family, my company, and my employees, and am no longer in a position to make a stand and risk their futures

I am deeply inspired by the support that has been shown by the reddit community, I cannot use any of the original footage, pursuant to the legal action that was brought against me.  Luckily, like so many of you have stated, it’s not too late to start over.  Please send messages to me directly, since the comments in these posts have taken on a life of their own, and have become very difficult to follow.

**Thank you again**, and for the inspiration that I sorely needed a long time ago.

But we have not yet prevailed.
The key vote in the United States Senate is scheduled to occur at 2:15 next Tuesday
The concern is that Senators may try to have it both ways.  They can say they are only voting “yes” on a motion to proceed to “allow the bill to be fixed.”  But the truth is that moving to proceed next week will leave the proponents of SOPA/PIPA in control of the process. 
It will shut down further debate and preclude input from Internet experts and the public and will prevent meaningful consideration of changes to the bills.  The goal of proponents of SOPA/PIPA is to pass something in both the House and Senate so that legislators can move “behind closed doors” into what is known as a “conference committee” and write what they want in secret.  
A yes vote on a motion to proceed is

AMA with superwoman ZOE LOFGREN that took place earlier: http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nfhhy/member_of_house_judiciary_committee_ama_on_sopa/

**______________**

**SOPA is far from defeated.  Treat today's mini-victory simply as a short delay and keep acting against it.**
**______________**


**STATUS:** No vote on the bill.

**WHY:** Chaffetz suggests a hearing with experts.  Astoundingly

**WHAT:** The session is over without a vote.  The deliberations will resume December 21st

**UHH:** The term ""classified hearing"" was used, not shown on tv, and the records would not be available until such a time as they were declassified.

**IS THIS GOOD OR BAD:** IT IS ~~VERY~~ GOOD.  As long as the bill isn't voted on and passed

**WHAT DO:** Keep contacting your representatives.  Call them. Mail them letters. Tell your friends

On January 18th 2012 the people of the Internet decided that they would act to protect their rights, at the people's request, turned themselves dark to draw notice to the contaminated legislation known as PIPA &amp; SOPA. We redirected the home pages of our websites with a single goal in mind: to show Americans how to contact their Members of Congress. That day millions of Americans learned how to petition their government. The response from some of Congress was refreshing: many whom were previously silent on the issue spoke up against the proposed legislation, and some of those who were co-sponsors changed their positions out of fear of political suicide. However, there are many members of Congress who are adamant about forcing legislation like [PIPA](http://projects.propublica.org/sopa/pipa#roll_call) &amp; [SOPA](http://projects.propublica.org/sopa/sopa#roll_call) through without public support or expert consultation.

In just days after millions did their best to petition their government, has announced that he has plans to keep pushing SOPA through Congress, and it is suspected that he will do this by painting anyone who does not vote for it as being a protector of pedophiles.

Congressman Lamar Smith's tactics are a dirty secret of Congress: when selfish ideas and bought legislation are going to be forced by lobbyists through Congress

Writers over at The Atlantic had this to say about how contaminated this bill already is:

[As written, and I'm not convinced it will contribute in a significant way to protecting children.""](http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/08/the-legislation-that-could-kill-internet-privacy-for-good/242853/)

What do this mean for you? Do you want to believe that because you aren't a pedophile that this bill does not apply to you? As much as we would all like to believe that this is the case we must realize that this bill targets each and every one of us as we go about our daily lives. It makes us all suspected criminals and exposes our private lives to the government. We would no longer have privacy in our own homes. Bought members of Congress who are pursuing special interests want to continue the deceitful practice that you can not object to bad legislation unless you have sympathy for pedophiles, so that our children, as adults, still retain the constitutional rights they have been guaranteed, and we must call out these fear mongers and tell them that we are not going to stand silent for their abuses on our rights.

The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 has a fear-tactic built right into it's name, the intimate details you share with your spouse? Do you want someone to be able to see the emails you send to your doctor or the gossip between coworkers about how bad your boss really is? Right now the government can easily obtain access to this information with a warrant. It is not hard to do because all law enforcement has to show is a good reason to suspect you of a crime. Legislation like the The Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 remove the need for a warrant. They break due process and pot this is something that is common in China. I do not think the United States should be taking tips on how to spy on its citizens from China. Do you? Furthermore, if major international companies like Sony and intelligence community resources like Stratfor can not keep their data safe from hackers then should your internet provider be able to ensure that your browsing history will not end up posted on the internet?

Hollywood and its lobbyists, many of you will see his name and think positively about this man. I do not blame you, but now  Chris Dodd is a lobbyist for multi-billion dollar corporate interests and is using his influence and connections to buy legislation from Congress.

The following quotes are taken directly from former Senator Chris Dodd:

""Those who count on quote 'Hollywood' for support need to understand that this industry is watching very carefully who's going to stand up for them when their job is at stake. Don't ask me to write a check for you when you think your job is at risk and then don't pay any attention to me when my job is at stake

[“Only days after the White House and chief sponsors of the legislation responded to the major concern expressed by opponents and then called for all parties to work cooperatively together

Former Senator Dodd is doing his best to spin the fact that millions of Americans stood up against corporate interests by claiming the opposite, as a CEO of a major media organization, to deceive everyday Americans into thinking that he is really fighting for their interests. For those of you at home wondering how much it costs to buy the influence of a thirty year former Senator: [the cost comes to $1.2 million dollars per year.](http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/145389-report-dodd-on-verge-of-becoming-mpaa-chairman)

There is a startling problem to the approach that Congressman Lamar Smith of Texas and former Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut have been using and that is the concept that they only want corporate interests to have a voice in these matters. [""In an interview Thursday, that could lead to a compromise. On Friday, Senator Harry Reid indefinitely postponed a cloture vote scheduled for Tuesday in the Senate, which appears to promise the death of the legislation in its current form.""](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/20/technology/dodd-calls-for-hollywood-and-silicon-valley-to-meet.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all) During the House Committee hearing for SOPA just two months ago, no experts in any technology related field had been yet been called to weigh in on the ramifications and consequences of the bill. At this time the bill was just steps away from being voted on by the House of Representatives. What had been done primarily behind closed doors was to have lobbyists and their lawyers directly influence the direction of SOPA so it would be tailored to their interests. These lobbyists from the MPAA, RIAA, and various other entities, have had four years to craft the perfect storm and now they once again want to have more back-room deals where they came come to an agreement

UPDATE: The Lady from California is nice! EDIT: Zoe Lofgren


**FURTHER UPDATES:**

* The SOPA supporters are trying to speed through the hearing. The opposition in the form of Darrel Issa

* SOPA supporter (I assume) just tried to stop the reading of the new amendment by saying that the opposition are listening to the reading in a biased way. The motion to dispense with the reading was denied.

OFF TOPIC SUGGESTION:  Mass uploads of ""infringing"" material to Youtube, Break, etc...., and put links to infringing content on your own blog (especially if it's hosted on blogger or wordpress or something), and also put ads on your blog after you link to infringing content, so that the ad provider has to be effected.  This would be for mass protest to demonstrate how ridiculous SOPA *actually* is in practice.

OFF TOPIC SUGGESTION: If you're rep is a Republican, tell them that SOPA is a massive violation of free speech, and even effects other countries!

* Ranking member compares opposition of SOPA to opposition of DMCA in 1998.  Says DMCA is now looked at as something that ""saved the web"".  Says DMCA isn't enough to stop foreign infringers.

* Conyers is speaking now. Says he didn't listen to the bill reading. ""All we're trying to do here is stop online piracy!"" -- accuses oppositon to SOPA of have some ulterior motive.

* Didn't get his name

* Mr. Watt speaking now. Says he's ""old fashioned"" and techno-illiterate. Says the Internet allows ""pirates"" to flourish. Argues that grandmothers can die

* Zoe Lofgren speaking now. She is opposed to SOPA. Says SOPA will make the Internet insecure. Mentioning the opinions of other opposition.

* Did anyone else lose the feed? - minor gap in coverage

* Mr. Berman speaking now: says U.S. doesn't have jurisdiction to go after foreign sources of piracy (implying that SOPA changes that). Says U.S. comparison to Chinese and Iran net censorship is disingenuous.

* Lofgren responds to Berman: says SOPA is the beginning of the balkanization of the Internet.

The videos are ~6 minutes each filled with text.  Later videos will have more, Lamar Smith's statement that people are being critical for nothing is a false statement.

Let me be clear here...  The first video was a learning experience and may be more technical than the second video.  The second has a much better flow to it.  It's easier to understand

As some of you are aware, but Lamar Smith is still trying to push through PCIP, another bill which would threaten the privacy of any web user. Think CISPA..but worse.

It’s amazing to see what we have accomplished in the last 3 months. We went from a handful of Redditors passionate in their opposition of SOPA to a membership base of over 1, and almost 600 on Twitter. We have funded a billboard in Lamar’s backyard, produced a professionally done advertisement,  and have been featured in some major media outlets like Mashable, BoingBoing and TheNextWeb.

In addition to all of this

Boots are on the ground, AZ to Kerrville, TX to lead a group of 10 volunteers to assist with handing out fliers, putting up signs and interacting with the voters in Lamar’s district. We are stepping out from behind our keyboards and monitors and getting out into the streets. We are making it happen, and we are here in TX-21 every weekend for the next 3 weeks.

Signing petitions and emailing your representative is a crucial first step when bills like SOPA, freedom and privacy on the internet to follow through and start holding politicians accountable for their bad legislation. TestPAC was formed as a mechanism to allow average citizens like us to do that.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation, these groups cannot do anything to make our politicians truly scared…they cannot be involved in elections. TestPAC can, and that’s what makes us different.

Most politicians only pay attention to corporations and special interests
Test PAC was founded on the premise that if politicians listen to special interest groups and PACs

Lamar Smith knows TestPAC is knocking. Several reporters who wrote about us have contacted him and his staff for comment. They know we are out there working to send him home from Washington. Now it’s time that he sees us in his district

Help us run a successful ground campaign by donating for fliers and signs to distribute in Lamar’s backyard. Help us get our commercial on TV by ensuring we raise enough money to make an impact. We have 3 weeks until the primary- this is our last chance.  

This is our last chance to do something about Lamar Smith. We will never have an opportunity like we do now again.

We need you. Please visit www.testpac.org to help us hit $5K on 5 May.

I think it's important to see how internet censorship is creeping up everywhere, laws that destroy the internet as we understand it are enacted behind our backs.

What can I as a citizen do to stop this? At the moment I'm gathering all the information I can and reading the original legal documents. I've also heard about various movements and organizations that are against this law

As a fellow internet user and avid fan of &lt;&lt;&lt;SITE NAME&gt;&gt;&gt;, are temporarily shutting down to raise awareness about these bills which threaten to destroy the internet as we know it.

As of now we know of no other pornography website which is planning to blackout on the 18th.  If you were to publicly pledge to participate and condemn internet censorship

Even just a splash page that people must click through (without shutting it down) would likely result in enormous positive implications. You have the power to help stop these bills.

Thank you for your time.

----------------------------------

To the management of &lt;&lt;&lt;SITE NAME&gt;&gt;&gt;: 

The ""STOP ONLINE PIRACY ACT"" and ProtectIP bills are a very real threat to your business and almost certainly will be used as a weapon by conservatives &amp; religious types to shut down internet porn sites. You ignore this legislation at your peril.

Please consider joining Wikipedia, and please consider joining in on a blackout on Jan 18th 2012 to raise support and awareness of this bill to STOP it from being made into law.

While Wikipedia, wider known sites who participated, as well a few I felt disappointed by. You may feel differently, so I understand this is only my opinion. This was true at time of writing. Thanks in advance for reading.

[The Oatmeal](http://www.theoatmeal.com) – for not only blacking out but also providing a very funny GIF in protest via the use of Oprah Winfrey and inter-species loving

[Explosm](http://www.explosm.net), all with plenty of links.

[Etsy](http://www.etsy.com/) – on first visit, with links on how to contribute. On second visit, the homepage was adorned with a large banner and link to the info page, though allowed normal use.

[GOOD](http://www.good.is/) – initially visitors greeted by a lengthy protest page decrying SOPA with many links

[PopUrls](http://www.popurls.com) - a lesser known web aggregator that shutdown entirely.

[Metafilter](http://www.metafilter.com) -  visitors were greeted by an inescapable black window of protest with requisite links to more info and action

[Newgrounds](http://www.newgrounds.com/) – the boisterous website was 100% shutdown today

[Ars Technica](http://arstechnica.com/) - for topping their homepage with a prominent and stylish banner condemning the bills

[Wired](http://www.wired.com/) – dominated by a headline article on SOPA

[SongMeanings](http://www.songmeanings.net) – I was glad to see one of the best lyrics websites on the internet (i.e.

[Rock Paper Shotgun](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/) – absolute blackout with the same Vimeo video as others

[ExtraCreditz](http://www.extra-credits.net/) - for making today's video about the ESA's support for SOPA/PIPA and desire for boycotts thereof in an emotive and defiant manner.

[Scribd](http://www.scribd.com/) – home page included a large banner denouncing the bills

[Oh Internet](http://www.ohinternet.com/) – shut down completely with a link to the petition site.

[TinEye](http://www.tineye.com) – this reverse image search is now totally shutdown for non-commercial users after an initial no-show

[Hype Machine](http://www.hypem.com) – like TinEye

[Cracked](http://www.cracked.com/) – massive anti-PIPA badge on entry and a link to the petition site.

[Mojang](http://www.mojang.com/) – “SOPA &amp; PIPA? How about NOPA!”

**Special mention** goes to [YouPorn](http://www.youporn.com) NSFW – while a touch small, and an activism feature. XVideos also blacked out, so take your fapping to these from now on. For some reason, it seemed to take me a while to check this one. Can’t think why.

**On the Fence – sites that reached a middle ground but much welcomed:**


[Penny Arcade](http://www.penny-arcade.com) - Tycho’s post featured some of his thoughts and opposition to the bill – describing it as ‘Satanic’ – as well as an invitation to view Extra Creditz’ piece of the issue. Great to hear. Yet compared to four of the other most popular webcomics out there (see above), yet I felt a little disappointed.

[TwitPic](http://www.twitpic.com) - after apparently stating their intention to join the protests, yet it still felt lacking.

[The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/) – eventually making protest, it didn’t really drive home the possible impact on content or provide much context.

[Grooveshark](http://www.grooveshark.com) – I’m a bit confused about this one

[TVTropes](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HomePage) – bordered with a bold STOP SOPA logo with links to ‘Fight For the Future’. No blacking out.

[UrbanDictionary](http://www.urbandictionary.com/) – while clearly stating their opposition to the bill with an modified logo and protest banner – linking to Google’s info page – I’d hoped they would blackout given that users are free to link images and videos into definitions

[DailyMotion US](http://www.dailymotion.com/us) – in a move that I felt showed up it’s billionaire neighbour across the fence, I hope the 500 person view count was just the counter frozen like YouTube does!

[LiveLeak](http://www.liveleak.com/) – blackout logo and a link to AmericanCensorship pages

[Disqus](http://www.disqus.com), though I believe DeviantArt users were able to censor their individual page.

The next list may include entries that you full well knew wouldn’t do anything but I didn’t know. I still think it is good to point out where activity was lacking. Also

**A Disappointment:**

[Digg](http://www.digg.com) - despite a small feed to the right of the main page, with no personal statement.

[Vimeo](http://vimeo.com/) – regardless of the fact that they played host to one of the most widely circulated, left-field community, with hundreds of videos that probably use cuts of copyrighted material. I was very disappointed here. **Edit:** Apparently they did feature pop-ups on videos, though I never saw any on my various checks.

[SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com) – I want to believe they were simply unaware of the goings-on. For a site that likewise is massively susceptible to hosting copyrighted media – and is about free expression and creativity – not a single word was offered on the site.

[Megaupload](http://www.megaupload.com) - really? A site already battling against legal attacks featured a tiny link at the bottom of the page

[Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com) – this is a site that had voiced it’s opposition in [November](http://www.kickstarter.com/blog/stop-the-stop-online-piracy-act)

[SomethingAwful](http://www.somethingawful.com/) – even though being a long standing community and once significant contributor to internet culture

I’m sure there are many more out there – both bad and good - but these are the ones I came across and have room for. More welcome below.

That's a good idea.  Be sure you let them know you appreciate them doing the right thing.  Make the association for them.

Facebook recently launched the option to display a large banner sized profile image at the top of your profile

I think that this can be used to display a large banner to inform people about where they can get information on SOPA and general message to contact their congressmen/woman. 

Imagine that 5 of your friends see this message and add the image themselves. Perhaps 5 of their friends see it and *they* add the image. We could have a serious [Haley Joel Osment situation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=DvKAPHvCPS8#t=20s) on our hands!

I've made a banner, let me know!

Also


**TL;DR: I made a banner to add to your Facebook timeline that will hopefully spread awareness about SOPA. **

So

**EDIT 1:** Alt color scheme: http://i.imgur.com/lv0C0.png

**EDIT 2:** Thanks for the support everyone! Tomorrow I will be making a profile picture to go along with the banner as well as a Twitter background for folks that don't have Facebook.

Originally I considered linking directly to the bill, let me know and I'll make that happen too!

**EDIT 3:** As promised

Tip: Be sure to set your background color to black so that it fades seamlessly. I will try to get to the Facbook profile image shortly! ",,t5_2t3xs,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/octfr/if_facebook_wont_blackout_raise_awareness/

Now the odds are you will not speak directly to your representatives...THIS IS OK...their aides generally do a great deal of research for them and help them make key decisions on votes. 

**Contacting your representatives is easy!**

[Contact your Represenative by using the EFF zip Code look up tool.](https://wfc2.wiredforchange.com/o/9042/p/dia/action/public/?action_KEY=8336) - All you have to do is enter your zip code in the box on the right and hit ""Submit Zip"". Your representatives information will be displayed

[Contact your Senator by using this look up tool.](https://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm) - Simply select your state from the drop box on the left. CALL BOTH OF THEM!

**How long will this take?**

3-5 Minutes per representative if you keep to simple talking points. 9 - 15 minutes for all 3 representatives.

**Will my representative actually listen?**

YES!...Well maybe. Most have no idea what SOPA is. Mine didn't, the better.

**What are some talking points?** 

I would recommend reading up a little on SOPA
[The EFF has this PDF with a very basic summary of the bill.](https://www.eff.org/sites/default/files/One-Page-SOPA_0.pdf)

I also talked to my representative and his aide a lot about the current abuse of DMCA take down notices and the whole Bit torrent lawsuit trolling scam. Showing how even the DMCA is being abused

DreamHost came to this conclusion after first hearing of the bill in late 2011 and has never wavered in its opposition. SOPA was

Web sites like YouTube, and any other sites that rely on user-generated content would be at risk of immediate shutdown should SOPA become law. It would make website owners liable for the content that its users post, impose strict punishments for vague definitions of piracy, and allow rights-holders to demand the immediate shutdown of entire domain names based on mere claims of rights infringement. The overhead needed to police this new law would make inexpensive web hosting a thing of the past.

When DreamHost employees were first told of SOPA and its potentially devastating impact on customers, followed by a very uneasy silence, followed by much shouting.

“So let me get this straight, who then contacts DreamHost to have their blog shut down?”

“The way it’s written, “Yes.”

“So the complaining company needs to prove its copyright claims to the Government?” pressed Padilla

Taking one forlorn long look across the room

“SOPA changes the way the Internet works, and removes the safe harbor protecting web hosts established by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). SOPA will create uncertainty for American entrepreneurs and stifle innovation, hurting American jobs and investment at exactly the time when the economy needs a boost from small businesses. We’re part of a coalition of leading web and Internet companies asking that Congress do the right thing and reject SOPA. It’s a flawed concept that is not in line with American values.”

&gt; Hi Jimmy

&gt;I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Reddit is capable of doing giant things, and a figurehead for free speech I feel as if your words would be taken less lightly and people across the globe might get on the same page so to speak.
&gt;
&gt; Thanks for everything you do


And his reply:

&gt;I think it's worth taking a step back and thinking about what we can 
accomplish and how we can win this thing. The boycott and back down of 
Go Daddy was important - it got the Internet community organized to 
start doing something. But the support of one company doesn't make or 
break SOPA - indeed
break SOPA - what does is awakening the general public and activating 
them to call

&gt;Many of the companies on the list of supporters do
legitimate beefs with the current situation. Particularly for companies 
like Chanel, etc. - they face a daily problem with 
counterfeit merchandise sold via foreign websites. Boycotting them 
would be counter-productive because they are rightly considered by the 
public to be victims here.

&gt;My issue is not with working to crack down on counterfeit goods
trademark infringement
the bill attempts to do so in a way that is inconsistent with the First 
Amendment and that the bill is technologically incompetent.

&gt;A boycott against companies who are not tech companies (and who 
therefore
technical issues) in this context runs the risk of the entire anti-SOPA 
movement being branded unfairly as not caring about the real problems.

&gt;So Go Daddy backed down - and Congress watched that play out. The next 
thing is not to hammer on other companies
directly. I've been told that if I can get 30
or write their Congressional representative
view is that 30

&gt;But to do that we have to get people off their butts to do the right 
thing. A lot of people! I think we can!

&gt;--Jimbo

Wise words. 

I can submit a screenshot for proof if need be.

Following all the news since [last week's announcement](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/01/stopped-they-must-be-on-this-all.html) has been intense. As an arbitrarily short summary of events (in no particular order):

* The White House has [made statements](https://wwws.whitehouse.gov/petitions#!/response/combating-online-piracy-while-protecting-open-and-innovative-internet) calling for more ""sound legislation"" than what PROTECT IP and SOPA propose
* The [DNS portions of the bills](http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2012/01/internet-blacklist-power-to-be-stripped-from-senates-protect-ip-act.ars) are under ""reconsideration"" and may be removed.
* SOPA itself *may* have been ""delayed
* Hundreds of sites have [decided to join reddit in the blackout](http://sopastrike.com/). Sites big and small
    * Wikipedia
    * [imgur](http://imgur.com/blog/2012/01/16/imgur-joins-blackout/)
    * Good Ol' Games
    * Destructoid
    * Free Software Foundation
    * Minecraft
    * Wordpress
    * The Cheezburger Network
    * Mozilla
    * Too many more to list them all here - see [sopastrike.com](http://sopastrike.com/) for a full list of verified and unverified sites

The fight is still far from over

* [sopastrike.com](http://sopastrike.com/) has some ideas
* [sopablackout.org](http://sopablackout.org/) has simple javascript for creating a blackout overlay
* [blackoutsopa.org](http://www.blackoutsopa.org/) has resources for changing your Twitter / Facebook profile in protest.
* EquanimousMind and Inuma are [running a facebook event](http://www.facebook.com/events/366829326666319/) aimed at spreading the word during the blackout.
* I'm no fan of ""SEO

Myself and the rest of the admins just discussed this. We definitely appreciate the sentiment of wanting reddit to ""match"" other sites' 24 hour blackouts. If we had anticipated the full effect our initial announcement had, 8 AM EST to 8 PM EST (5 AM to 5 PM PST) blackout for the following reasons:

* Our peak traffic is during working hours in U.S. timezones. We have the maximum impact by blacking out during the time period slotted
* Coming back up in the evening provides an opportunity to discuss the day's events on reddit
* The 12 hour timeslot minimizes (though of course, but there's only so much that non-U.S. redditors can do.
* In terms of preparation, but it's part of the considerations",,False,,t5_2t3xs,True,,admin

Guys, your Internet will very likely *break* and you will *not* understand why. I am urging you to be aware of the list's existence but do *nothing* with it until something awful happens.

If you have trouble following the list's directions in the first place

Administrators like us need to change IP addresses frequently. Whether we're doing failover, sometimes an IP address needs to change. Since the only method of accessing us that we support publicly is through the domain name system, we typically don't give any thought to throwing away an IP and reusing it elsewhere. (Behind the scenes of your typical Web browsing, IP addresses are actually a scarce commodity. Many of us are giving some back to be given to other people.)

If you put these entries in your system's static hosts file, you will have no idea why sites stopped working. Please, do not use this list until SOPA is **passed**, **implemented**, and **something actually happens**. Realistically, the earliest this could happen is probably 2014 or even later. There is absolutely no reason to use this list on your computer today. None.

To compound this problem, and if you copy an address from that list without knowing what you're doing, there's a pretty good chance the performance of your Internet will drop across the board. *Particularly* if you fuck with Google, Reddit, and so on.

In the unlikely event that you actually have to use this list

TL;DR If you use the emergency list today, the emergency list can and very likely will break your Web browsing.**

That said, that's a given. But by offering a good service/product you absolutely can have a majority of people purchase content legitimately.

SOPA will not work. SOPA threatens a helluva lot more than it will possibly gain for the RIAA/MPAA (which will not be a lot) and it needs to die right now.

If I were in USA I would be calling my congressman right now and doing whatever I can to stop this. And I'm a person that is pretty much the most affected by piracy. That should tell you a lot.

Stopping SOPA is delaying the inevitable; they'll keep doing it until there's protest fatigue and it'll be easier to make compromises that will still lead to [less internet freedom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Door-in-the-face_technique) (SOPA Lite).

Having INTERNET FREEDOM bills will not only stop SOPA-like bills

The bill can remain in committee for an indefinite amount of time until passed or defeated.  Hearings are often held where members of the committee are able to ask questions of experts in the fields that relate to the bill being discussed.  Amedments may be offered by any member.  Amendments are things that modify the bill or add something to it.  After getting through all hearings and amendments

Once it passes both the House and Senate, no more amendments are allowed.  A debate is had, and the members vote.  If there are 2/3 or more in the affirmative in both the House and Senate, the veto can be overridden and be passed into law despite the Presidental veto.

&gt; The internet-driven protest movement in the US is no longer anything to scoff at... and therefore must be manipulated so that this kind of wrench can never again be thrown in the power brokers' machinery.

&gt;For a while, and that the masses in the US can use this technology to affect real change, derailing our plans and disrupting the profitability models of our clients. Now that we're awake to this reality, we must ensure that this debacle is never repeated.

I expect multiple fronts to be opened or expanded...

1. Astroturfing
1. They will seek to divide. Divide and conquer is the oldest trick in the book
1. They will manipulate the timeframe. Don't expect potentially controversial legislation to have this much time for debate in the future. The most controversial provisions will be introduced as last-minute addenda to otherwise innocuous-sounding bills so that there isn't a chance for momentum to build in the opposition online.
1. Attempts will be made to discredit the major players. Expect to see negative publicity campaigns impugning the virtue and motivations of the companies who supported this blackout. [It has already begun](http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/18/chris-dodd-sopa-blackout-is-an-abuse-of-power/).

The vocal opposition to these bills clearly caught Washington by surprise. But as Japanese Admiral Yamamoto said after learning of the successful attack on Pearl Harbor

People like Chris Dodd have spent decades building their influence within government's hierarchical paradigm. They're not about to relinquish that power to a bunch of faceless nobodies.

I hope everyone is prepared for the considerable pushback that is to come.

2. Their upsell process is so incredibly fucking annoying it makes me want to bitch-slap my computer screen

3. Their servers are excessively slow

Well buddy, before it's too late. Maybe people will read this, maybe they won't, but hopefully they'll still be able to. 

You've been a constant companion for us all for years now, and put a world of facts at our fingertips and in our pockets. Documents from a century ago, movies we've never heard of, programs that top anything Microsoft or Apple put out, you brought them all to us. You're Red from *Shawshank Redemption*, the “man who can get it for you”, and we're very grateful. No matter how stupid the YouTube comments got, we still needed you

Maybe it won't be that bad; maybe the government will be as bad at censoring you as it has been at everything else it's tried to control. Millions of people every day drink underage, explore abandoned buildings, drive over the speed limit, and commit hundreds of other little trespasses every day without really worrying about getting caught. Maybe SOPA will end up as a laughingstock, an unenforceable daydream that the American people refer to with a wink and a nudge. Americans have proven time and again that we are an innovative bunch, and we will find the holes in any law we deem unjust. Prohibition tried to outlaw something Americans loved, so they worked around it until Washington realized how foolish it looked, Washington folded under the pressure.

If we're lucky, and you won't have the strength you used to. You'll be a mere shell of your former self.

Eventually, and instead of paying gangsters for what we want, we'll have to pay corporations. Any time we want to watch the “Say 'what' again” scene from *Pulp Fiction*, we better be ready to shell out for the whole DVD. Any time we want to make a music video with your friends, we better not try sharing it, 'cause someone already owns that song. Any time we want to caption an image on memgenerator.com, we better pray no one has copyrights on the picture. Any time we want to watch an obscure Dr. Who episode, we're just shit outta luck. Shell Out or Shut Up will be the whole of the law. 

I'm sorry, and experience has been overpowered by the greed of the few for power and money. We will fight as hard and as long as we have to to get you back, and one day we will. In the meantime, please don't hate us, and know that we never wanted it to be this way.

Goodnight and Good Luck.",,t5_2t3xs,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/ne9bg/a_farewell_letter_to_the_internet/

I have to say I feel very betrayed by the SOPA act. I completely oppose everything it stands for. We as a people don’t have much freedom anymore even though we are completely brainwashed into thinking we do. The internet for me is more than just a place to watch other people sing lady gaga songs on YouTube, and if this bill passes many people will feel the same, if they don’t already. This bill will put a muzzle on every American, no more creativity or free expression online. All we will get is government censored websites and we will be able to research things only the government deems worthy to know. Money isn’t the most important thing in the world, freedom is, the kind of freedom our ancestors died for, the freedoms this country was founded upon, those values have been skewed. The SOPA bill affects a lot more than protecting big companies and their intellectual property. It goes to the point where it will censor all countries not in the United States from displaying their website to us and ours to them. What this means is that the United States will be cut off from all forms of communication. This will allow our government to censor and filter all info that is obtained via the internet in the United States. This is not freedom; it is a step above being a prisoner of the state.

WHAT IS MEGAUPLOAD'S STANCE TOWARDS ABUSE?
Recently

Megaupload is a so-called ""cyberlocker"" and allows its users to conveniently store and transmit any kind of data from anywhere, Megaupload provides a multi-use tool, just like an e-mail account, a USB stick, or the Internet as a whole - it can be used for legitimate and illegitimate purposes alike. In fact, most public Internet services, including backbone carriers, as long as they fulfill specific requirements

On the legal side, bypassing the DMCA process entirely. Because we strictly conform to all legal requirements, nobody has successfully sued us over copyright infringement, and cases brought forward against our competitors have a long history of being unsuccessful.

We operate one of the world's largest storage clusters, abuse does happen and is an inevitable fact of life in a free society, but it is curbed heavily and efficiently by our close cooperation with trusted takedown partners. It is just unfortunate that the activities of a small group of ""black sheep"" overshadows the millions of users that use our sites legitimately every day.

Mega has over 150 million registered users and over 50 million daily unique visitors. Employees of over 70% of the world's Fortune 500 companies have accounts with us. We have become the de-facto standard for sending files that are too big to email. We are the most popular hard disk in the cloud. We host more backups than any other company. If Mega is a rogue operator as we have been unfairly labelled by the MPAA and RIAA, illegal or even criminal content for which they are not liable nor legally obliged to prevent their users from posting. They are, like Megaupload, online service providers who are in no position to monitor or restrict their users. activities. There are technical, practical and legal reasons why these entities as a whole enjoy safe harbor protection all over the world. Service providers like Megaupload are simply better off focusing on providing a better service to their customers than fending off lawsuits from third parties unhappy about content.

That said, too. Microsoft's Windows operating system is the world's largest enabler of piracy. Windows is used to transfer and consume pirated content on a massive scale every day.

**1. What is /r/boycottthebatman?**

[/r/boycottthebatman](/r/boycottthebatman) is a subreddit created to organize the opening weekend boycott of *The Dark Knight Rises*.

**2. Why boycott a movie?**

reddit blacked out for 12 hours on January 18th

More action is required to stop these bills and more importantly

Entertainment lobbyists like the MPAA were able to spend millions of dollars in contributions in order to create these bills. Bills so apparently devoid of outside input that if they had passed

It's time to directly target lobbying groups like the MPAA and the lawmakers who have chosen to put corporate interests ahead of the public.

**3. Why only the opening weekend?**

Opening weekend numbers and box-office totals in general dictate a lot of the way society talks about movies. They also impact the way movies are made and promoted.

*The Dark Knight Rises* is poised to break the opening weekend record as the *The Dark Knight* currently holds the #2 spot. Hollywood and the media will surely notice if *TDKR* doesn't break the record.

It will be hard to influence the behavior of millions of Americans

Finally

**4. But I really want to see *The Dark Knight Rises*/I'm a huge fan of Batman!**

I want to see it too!  But we have to endure a little pain and take action to ensure we're not just falling victim to 'slactivism'.

I think fans will appreciate that Nolan's Batman could influence real life. In the first two movies

In *The Dark Knight Rises* trailer, Mr. Wayne. You and your friends better batten down the hatches. Because when it hits, you're all going to wonder how you ever thought you could ever live so large and leave so little for the rest of us."" 

Christopher Nolan seems to want to talk about Occupy Wall Street. I think we should oblige him.

**5. What if I want to boycott for longer than a weekend/other media?**

[/r/boycottthebatman](/r/boycottthebatman) will allow the discussion of a longer boycott and support other reddits like [/r/boycotthollywood](/r/boycotthollywood)

Just thought you'd like to see the exchange I had with good old GoDaddy over the past 24 hours.

---

My support ticket

&gt; I would like to know how to cancel my account outright. I have transferred my domains from GoDaddy due to its support of the SOPA legislation

&gt; Thank you in advance for your help --

GoDaddy's response

&gt;Dear datn

&gt;Go Daddy is the world’s largest domain name registrar with more than 50 million domain names in our portfolio. Go Daddy has a full time presence in Washington D.C. and takes an active role in Congressional and legislative proposals.

&gt; Included in Go Daddy’s legislative efforts is the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). We are currently reviewing the most recent legislative proposal and continue to educate ourselves on the many facets of SOPA. We look forward to working with Congress to refine legislative language about this issue when appropriate.

&gt; To review Go Daddy's statement on the matter

&gt; &lt;instructions on canceling the various services&gt;

My response

&gt; Thank you. Of course I had already read GoDaddy's position announcement on SOPA before canceling. I appreciate your help.

Their sudden response today to my closed ticket (cut-and-pasted inexpertly with breaks inside paragraphs

&gt; Go Daddy Customer

&gt; We recently published our position on the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA). You responded

&gt; Go Daddy is no longer supporting SOPA.

&gt; ""Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, Go Daddy's newly appointed CEO, said. ""It's very important that all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.""

&gt; For more information on our position

My final response:

&gt; Dear GoDaddy

&gt; Thank you for your response to my ticket. 

&gt; Since it is my understanding that GoDaddy participated in authoring SOPA and testified before the Senate in favor of the legislation, and a couple of interviews counts as ""too little, too late"". 

&gt; Please let me know when Warren Adelman steps up before the Senate and formally recants your company's support for the legislation.

Thanks for sharing your feedback with us. I’ve forwarded your comments on SOPA to the appropriate departments within the company so that your feedback will be heard.
 

Please know that Nintendo is strongly in favor of free speech. In fact
 

We don’t allow U.S. stores to operate that are dedicated to selling stolen goods. Why should rogue websites that break U.S. law be any different? We need laws to address this reality and are confident Congress can find the right balance in the coming months.

From the Internet to the iPod, creators, and consumers. When our freedoms in the networked world come under attack, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is the first line of defense. EFF broke new ground when it was founded in 1990—well before the Internet was on most people's radar—and continues to confront cutting-edge issues defending free speech, privacy, innovation, and consumer rights today. From the beginning

Blending the expertise of lawyers, and technologists, EFF achieves significant victories on behalf of consumers and the general public. EFF fights for freedom primarily in the courts, bringing and defending lawsuits even when that means taking on the US government or large corporations. By mobilizing more than 61,000 concerned citizens through our Action Center, EFF beats back bad legislation. In addition to advising policymakers, EFF educates the press and public.

EFF is a donor-funded nonprofit and depends on your support to continue successfully defending your digital rights. Litigation is particularly expensive; because two-thirds of our budget comes from individual donors

[GoDaddy CEO] Adelman couldn’t commit to changing its position on the record in Congress when asked about that, he said “We’re going to step back and let others take leadership roles.” He felt that the public statement removing their support would be sufficient for now, though further steps would be considered.
So, the ""we no longer support SOPA"" statement released yesterday seems to be just a calculated PR move.
I'll still be moving all my domains.""

""Congresswoman xxxxxx- I am a resident of xxxxxx. I am an online social media and community manager employed in your district. I make my living online. I am very worried about the far-reaching implications of SOPA and hope that you will oppose its passage in the house. 

SOPA rewrites the framework of the internet and allows self-interested corporations to control the off switch for sites that may or may not be responsible for infringing copyrights. Corporations that have shown a lack of regard for whether their DCMA or ICE takedown notices are valid. SOPA is a scorched earth policy that punishes the greatest communication medium the world has ever seen. It will decimate fair-use and safe-harbor provisions and drive profitable

There's no avoiding it- people will continue to buy games new (and sell them) no matter what you do. But, as well as Amazon, evil as they may be, actually have not expressed support for SOPA or PROTECT IP, so unless you're boycotting them for some other reason you can continue to buy used games from them.

The bad news is that you can't download things used unless they're free. So no Wii Shop Channel, and no PlayStation Store. And since you have to pay for Xbox Live, you can't use that either, so you might as well stop playing Xbox altogether. Also, you can't play games with paid subscriptions that are made by the first party or a third party that supports SOPA or PROTECT IP.

The only games you can buy new are third-party games made by developers that don't support SOPA or PROTECT IP.

It has come to my attention that Google, and even Reddit (along with other sites) have been considering the idea of a coordinated blackout of services on the 21st of January, 2012. This is an idea that I, personally, find to be brilliant. To say that the temporary loss of these services would be a hiccup in the lives of Americans would be a dramatic understatement. 

It is of mutual benefit both to these websites and the users who love them that SOPA not be passed; I am sure there is no doubt of this fact among members of this website

I know that I am a new Redditor

I feel, Google, and all of the other prospective participants of this proposed blackout will at the very least bring the issue to the fore of the average American.

Not everyone uses Reddit. Not everyone pays attention to legislative issues. Even novice internet users use Google

As cheesy as it sounds

So

**The Good**

* SOPA was definitely the most popular issue there - there were three distinct questions during the Q&amp;A period regarding the bill

* Most of the SOPA-related questions fed into some kind of ""this bill is going to destroy jobs"" statement so that was also nice

**The Bad**

* Berman actually received applause for his support of SOPA at some points. However

* In fact, technological progress, etc.) is well established in the mind of many older union members.

However, they have to be shown that passing SOPA will have a detrimental effect on jobs (not only in Southern California, but all over the country), which will in turn have a detrimental effect on the stocks and securities that their pension plans own.

Spread the word, but I have a pretty extensive mastery of legal-ese, as well as a penchant for word problems.  The 3 part series is pretty much designed for people that really want to see EVERYTHING in CISPA.

[Part 3 - Section 3 - (d) through Section 7](http://redd.it/1cyo8o).

For a short and sweet ELI5-version of CISPA...

CISPA creates a way for the US Government and companies like Facebook, to share that information among others that shouldn’t know (what WikiLeaks does), and allows for companies to trade personal information without getting in trouble.  It also allows for the US Government to spy on US citizens, to prosecute people that pirate movies, games or music, and does all of this without telling you.  You will also never know it’s happening.

The extreme version is people violating CISPA can be labeled ""domestic terrorists"" through a combination of CISPA and the Patriot Act

Many companies (nearly all that support CISPA, and everyone from internet providers to social networking sites will make money from the trading of information.  This is why there are so few companies fighting CISPA, and more reason for us citizens to protect our freedoms and liberties from ""Big Brother.""",,False,,t5_2t3xs,,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/1cyref/cispa_and_you_a_guide/

Automatically.",vytah,76,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/nigbw/how_to_generate_your_own_sopa_emergency_list/, and if you tried to make your own list manually

I present you a shell script that monitors your DNS queries and stores all IPs associated with hostnames you visit. It was tested on Linux only.

[**The main daemon script**](http://pastebin.com/3wJp6uRh)

[**An additional script for automated updating your /etc/hosts**](http://pastebin.com/wgmpHkur)

Requirements: Perl, also Cygwin.

Usage: run the daemon script as root. Browse the internet. When you feel like it, I didn't test it; if it doesn't, simply kill tcpdump).

You also can update your /etc/hosts manually. In any case

Don't forget the configuration. It's done by modifying the script. The most important part are /etc/hosts file location and exception list (note that the exception lists in both scripts play a different role).

It's downright shameful what congress is doing. Corporate influence is ruining this country. (And- many others.) Right now

So- What to do when that happens?

I'd like to say- Don't buy their products or visit their websites. But, etc... Well- That isn't going to go over well. 

Maybe- It'd be better to make an example out of somebody. 

While It'd hard to get the masses to not watch movies or buy music... it might be easier to get them to blacklist one company- to make an example out of them. Not watch their movies

Looking at the music industry and how all these things relate- 'Who' to boycott becomes (in my opinion..) obvious.

(Last I checked...) There's only really 4 major record labels... EMI

(Well

EMI no longer really 'exists.' Last I heard

That only leaves Universal/Vivendi. Which (to my knowledge..) is purely an entertainment company.

So

Don't watch their movies. Don't buy their music. Don't watch their TV stations. Don't buy their products or visit their websites. 

Make an example out of them.

I fully realize they own a lot of stuff. But

Your basic rights are being put in danger... So somebody can sell more tickets to 'The Fast and the Furious Part 6.'

You gotta throw the gauntlet down somewhere.

I think we can all agree that these days we consider the Internet to be a basic human right

We see that fighting those who try to mutilate the internet to become their own private conveyor belt for their new and over priced products is futile. In one week we managed to stop SOPA and PIPA just to find out about ACTA on the next

What if we could avoid all that and move on to the next level and create a new Internet that is free, and unbiased by monetary power?

---------------------

We have the technology to establish a global wireless mesh network to extend and eventually replace the existing internet infrastructure, laptop, and most modern desktop computers).

A Wireless Mesh Network is a network consisting of Wireless Routers much like the one you have in your house connected to your internet service provide

The top-of-the-line wireless router costs today about $30 for the consumer

What I'm proposing is to establish a company that creates and maintains this network

Imagine an entire world interconnected with this wireless mesh where no single authority can alter the way this network is run or who can access it and what information can be accessed.

The technology exists, the hardware (dozens of designs are available already), and software for the end consumer that would make this all possible.

Imagine that in 5 years, voice and text communication, we have Viber, Face Time, Skype, and Google Talk, Twitter, and the list goes on and on and it could easily replace our current cellular networks

The next generation of wireless routers can support 1.3gb/s of data, all you have to do is buy a wireless router supporting this technology, and you have your own internet service provider.

New ""SECURE IT"" bill to replace CISPA?",8,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/SOPA/comments/vopq6/received_this_email_from_saxby_chamblisss_office/,"""Dear Mr. Scarfieasbro:


Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity legislation. Your taking time to contact me is appreciated.

 

S. 2105, 2012.  This legislation would direct the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), in consultation with owners and operators of critical infrastructure, the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory Council, and other federal agencies and private sector entities, to conduct a top-level assessment of cybersecurity risks to determine which sectors face the greatest immediate risk.  In addition, DHS would be required to identify or develop risk-based cybersecurity performance requirements as well as implement cyber response and restoration plans.

 

Today there are increasing threats of espionage and attacks over the internet that threaten our national security.  However, the ""Strengthening and Enhancing Cybersecurity by Using Research, Education, Information, and Technology (SECURE IT) Act of 2012.""  This legislation would improve our cybersecurity without increasing the size of the federal government, creating burdensome regulations that hamper the private sector, or adding to the enormous national debt.

 

Furthermore, the ""Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.""  This legislation currently resides in the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. 

 

I am hopeful that the Senate will recognize the importance of enhancing our cybersecurity in a responsible manner by supporting the SECURE IT Act.   As the Senate considers future cybersecurity legislation, or H.R. 3523, I will keep your comments in mind.

 

 

 

If you would like to receive timely email alerts regarding the latest congressional actions and my weekly e-newsletter


I presume this new bill will be just as terrible for internet freedom.
