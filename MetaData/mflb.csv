I've noticed that a lot of new users have been coming over to r/mflb, it's only a matter of time until memes and circlejerking dominate the front page. It's inevitable with the voting system that Reddit uses, as memes are more relatable and naturally garner a larger amount of upvotes from the masses.

This subreddit, and I request that you post your non-magic flight related posts to [/r/trees](/r/trees) (where you're more likely to get more karma anyway, if that's what you're into), and that we keep macroimages and other meme-y stuff off of here, just to keep the relevant discussions alive.

1326241211.0,obkpz,The Ultimate MFLB Q&amp;A - V1.0,vivalasteve,206,17,44,"**A) Pros

**Q: How stealthy is the MFLB?**

A: It's definitely one of the most stealthy ways to medicate.  The box dimensions are 2.5 by 1.25 by 0.9 inches. It fits in the palm of your hand and in your pocket. If you live with people who are not OK with your habits

**Q: Well

A: As with all vaporizors, the more vaporizing it is going to smell.  With that said, the smell doesn't linger and will go away in ten minutes max in a ventilated room by normal usage.  To keep the smell to a minimum, I have found that blowing hits out through my clothes or into a pillow greatly reduces the smell, or you can use a sploof. If you do not use it in a ventilated room and do not keep your stash in an airtight container, the room will probably smell no matter what, so just use common sense.

**Q: How much herb will I conserve by using the MFLB?**

A: One normal 'trenchload' is about equivalent to ~0.1g.  Depending on tolerance

**Q: What's the difference between the high from smoking and vaping?**

A: This depends on the person; some people prefer one over the other. The general consensus, and you can do it for a lot longer period of time before becoming 'burnt out'. If you've never tried vaporizing before, use someone else's before you purchase one.

**Q: How many people can the MFLB accommodate?**

A: As many people as you want it to, it's perfect.  If you plan on vaping mostly in large groups, consider a plug-in vaporizer like the Silver Surfer, Volcano, Extreme-Q, Vapor Bros, etc.

**Q: How durable is the MFLB

A: Its made out of solid wood with a plastic slide cover, the cover could break off (happened to me). But don't worry! The MFLB comes with a lifetime warranty and the company has AWESOME customer service.  Even if it's you're fault, you email the company inquiring for a replacement and they will send you a brand new one after confirming your serial number. Just follow their instructions.

**Q: Ok

A: The recommended place to order the MFLB is from the company's website

**B) General Information**

**Q: OK

A: First thing is first. Make sure all your batteries are charged fully before using. Once they're charged, you can also use a pill bottle and a nickle and shake it. Next, you can pack the trench with the herb. You can pack as little as you want, but the maximum you should pack is up to the top of the trench without it overflowing.  Also, make sure it is **loosely packed!** Also, you can use the draw stem or just hit it from the hole, it's up to personal preference.

Now, the community decided 'best' way to hit it is by taking 'sips' of vapor.  [This guy gives a pretty good description on how to do it if you are having problems](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lz68fCk97fM) Practice makes perfect. Make sure you shake it between hits. After the herb turns dark brown and stops giving good hits, empty the box out. **SAVE THE HERB!!!** You can use it for other things, as described in the next section.  Make sure you use the brush to get any remaining material out. Don't get lazy and do this everytime, your box will thank you.

**Q: I accidently burned it! What should I do?**

A: You or someone inexperienced may accidently burn it

**Q: How do I clean it?**

A: Make sure the box is empty of material, and will remain this way.  Its due to normal usage, and it will not affect your functionality whatsoever.  Repeat until satisfied, then heat the box up again to vaporize any remaining iso.

To clean the draw stems, then push them through the stems. You can also soak the stems in iso, but this is not recommended because if you leave them in for too long the material will degrade.  Either way, after you clean them with iso just rinse them with water and voila.

**Q: So what's the deal with the batteries? How long do they last? Can I use any other types?**

A: Each battery will last from 1-2 trenches, which is more than enough for a few people.  Mine take a few hours to recharge, and I use this quite frequently with friends so I purchased more batteries. You can use any AA Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) rechargeable batteries above 2000mAh.  Generally, the higher the mAh the better.  Some good ones are the energizers with the fifteen-minute recharger that you can find relatively anywhere that sells rechargeable batteries.  Another good brand are Powerex's, as well as Eneloops. You just have to make sure that you peel off the coating on the outside of the aftermarket batteries so that the negative body can touch the metal loop on the inside of the box. Like [this](http://img545.imageshack.us/img545/763/20101030.jpg).

**Q: How should I store the batteries?**

A: You should always put the protective caps on the positive ends of the stock batteries.  If any part of the negative and positive parts touch metal and complete a circuit
  
**Q: Can I vape kief or hash?**

A: Yes! Just sprinkle a VERY TINY pinch the trench and vape it like you normally would.  After it's done

**C) AVB** 

**Q: What's a good firecracker recipe for AVB?**

A: If you don't want to eat it straight up or in gel caps, 0.5-1g per person is enough for all the time's I've made it. Take the amount of AVB that you want to use and put it in all natural peanut butter, nutella, or both for maximum deliciousness.  Mix in enough pb/nutella to completely cover and mix in the AVB.  Again, don't worry about measurements here. It just needs to be thoroughly mixed in depending on how much AVB you have. You can eat this on crackers straight away, or you can attempt to get the little remaining THC activated by microwaving (yes, microwaving) the mixture in 15-30sec intervals until the mixture changes consistency. You'll see what I mean when you do it.  Allow to cool, and enjoy.  These creep on slowly for most people

**Q: What about green/brown dragon?**

A: This is simply AVB soaked in ethyl (drinkable) alcohol.  The easiest way to do this is to take high proof alcohol (151 or everclear) and put the AVB you've accumulated into a jar with just enough alcohol so that the level of alcohol above the AVB sediment is a about an inch. Put a lid on the jar and shake it up, and voila.  The standard dose is about a tablespoon. You should definitely mix it with juice or something.  If you want it stronger, just leave the alcohol uncovered so that some evaporates off.

AVB (Alredy Vaped Bud)

* Use a small airtight container to store your AVB. People commonly use small ziplock containers.
* Use a contact case to hold freshly ground herb
* Once you vape your bud the heat activates the THC in the weed but doesnt get 100% out.
* You can save the vaped cannabis to cook with
* You can eat the AVB and get high from it just like any other edibles without the need to cook/bake the weed.
* Smoke the AVB. I like to roll joints with it.
* Generally you would want to use 1-2 grams of AVB in a sandwitch or other food to get an effect. The amount varies per user and tolerance.

ITS ACTUALLY CALLED A THIRD LUNG

**Why should I use the Third Lung with my MFLB

You've seen the front page of r/mflb recently! Well, and they say its nice but it doesn't seem to get them that high and you think they're just being nice saying it's nice, especially since the MFLB doesn't excel in a crowd. Maybe you like the physics of the lung and watching the precious vapor pour out of the stem and the bag snap back as you rocket all the vapor from the lung to your lungs. Hell, maybe you're like me, and you have an exceptionally high tolerance - YES. IT EVEN WORKS FOR THAT. THE THIRD LUNG IS JESUS - I'M NOT GOING TO BEAT AROUND THE BURNING BUSH.

I don't care where you've been

**How do you make one

First

Before you make it

**And a video:**[salty84](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uW6Ulx60Cqs&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player)

FOR NOW

&gt;Cut a bottle in half. Throw away bottom half. Get a plastic bag

&gt;Now

&gt;Final Obstacle: Take the cap of your bottle and you need to poke, then used a dental pick, then the point of some scissors and finally poked out a hole that perfectly fit my stem.

&gt;Now, and place the MFLB w/ stem into the hole you cut in the cap. Grab the part of the bag closest to the cap with you fingers. Begin pressing in the battery, hold ~5 seconds, then begin pulling the bag with your fingers out of the bottle away from the cap. You should see vapor spew out of your stem into the bottle. IMPORTANT: The vapor should be grey and opaque. If it is WHITE, pull the bag faster. If you see no vapor spewing, pull slower.

&gt;Once you've filled the bottle to your heart's content
*Spin the cap off
*Pull MFLB off
*Pull MFLB and stem off

&gt;Bam! I have increased the potency of your hits by x%! Two trenches gets me to a clear-headed

Finally

**PROS**

* Can take you to an [8] and beyond
* Great for group vaping! We've essentially Macgyvered a Volcano Vaporizer on a budget!
* Easy to make, 1 liter for group, 2 liter for special occassions.

**Cons**

* May present a stronger smell then regular MFLB. Use with caution

That's it! Wait! One last thing. There are three ways to transfer the vapor from the lung to your lungs.

1. *Leave stem and cap on

2. *Leave cap on

3. *Take cap off, and the vapor will be propelled directly to the depths of your lungs. Beware coughers and chiefers. Mastering these hits will solidify your Elite Third Lunger status.

**NOW GO MAKE A THIRD LUNG!** Report back with experiences

*It's the future.*

You start playing around with it and you say to yourself ""of course it's this way

What follows are some of the high points of the device IMO.

- You know that moment where you've just take a huge rip off your favourite glass pipe and you exhale?  You know that sharp burning sensation you get at the back of your throat?  The raspy cutting shards of irritation? No more

- You know that oppressive smell of charred and immolated plant matter that fills your room/park/wherever and makes you paranoid someone will hassle you?  It is replaced by a soft and inoffensive herbal scent

- You know how you always worry that all your talk about how safe bud is feels disingenuous when you compare it to the amount of combusted butane/matches you've inadvertently inhaled along the way? Well this thing uses the power of freaking ELECTRONS.  Each time you press that battery in milliamps of current rushes into the mesh trough

I wish I didn't sound like such a commercial

Putting a bit of kief on top of bud works great its amazing no problems no worries and is a great way to do it. However

Vaping straight kief right off the screen is not a big deal and I do it all the time. Sure

To clean your screen properly, I promise you any build up (kief included) will melt away like butter. Once this is done I usually heat it up for 5-10 seconds again once or twice to get rid of any excess alcohol.

I find your best bet to minimize the potential for clogging your screen is to load just a sprinkle of kief in for every hit. If you drop a big fat pile of kief into the trench, then pack in a little more, and you'll greatly reduce any clogging. Even if a little kief gets clogged in the screen, another hit from the box will vape that stuff up too.

I can't tell you how many times I've seen this argument

A few weeks ago, but yet not too far off/removed where we'd draw suspicion. We settled on a place maybe 5 parking spots away from the nearest car.

All was going well for about an hour

I was in the middle of a hit on the Launch Box, and warned my friend. At this point, I assumed I was about to be arrested. I began mentally steeling myself for the shit-storm of the next two days.

Luckily our windows were down. The cop pulled in front of us and got out, and probably looked high as a cloud's balls. 

The cop walked up and asked, when my friend (whose eyes were not red like mine) ""Hangover 3 at 9:30"". 

The cop said

""It came out yesterday

The cop bent down, ""So there's  no illegal activity going on here? Nothing illegal in the car?""

We both replied

He looked at me, while thinking, ""And here's the checkmate, it's obvious I'm so high.""

He said, as if confirming I was high.

Then all of a sudden, you two have a good day,"" and walks off.

My heart nearly tore out of my chest

We ended up going to see the movie because we were scared of him coming back (It was good high --most likely shit sober) and my friend mentioned how frustrating it must have been for the cop, no visible bongs/pipes/weed (I had thankfully put it in the center console), and while I was visibly high, he couldn't really do much about it. So he left.

And my life was kept from possibly being derailed

So thank you

**How to make your ceilings lower with the glorious MFLB**

1. Grind your weed super fine

2. Put in a freshly charged Powerex (freshly charged meaning just got a green indicator).

3. Go native aka don't use the included glass stem. Put the stem somewhere safe for use later

4. Hold the battery in

5. Hold hit in for about 10 seconds. Exhale.

6. Shake Box and flip load if necessary (sometimes the load can stick to the screen

Few things I've learnt since ive had it:

* The smell is not as discrete as some people say. If i was to vape indoors people would definitely tell. However if I just go out to my garage to vape the smell dissipates almost instantly.

* ALWAYS use elastic bands. If you don't and you have the box in your pocket or something then your herb finds its way under the screen and its a bitch to get out sometimes. I've never had it come open in my  pocket but I've heard of it happening to people

* The grind makes more difference than you think. First few times I used it I just stuck the bud through my normal 3 piece but after i heard that the finer grind was better I tried it and I could tell the difference. I couldn't find a pill bottle so I used the toy container from a kinder egg and a 5p (I'm British). Shake the fuck out of it for about 1 minute and you get a really fine grind.

* AVB is stronger than you think. I ate about .5g of and left it an hour and felt nothing. So I ate another .5 and about 10 minutes later the first dose kicked in. Fast forward to an hour later and I'm gone

If you are thinking of buying an MFLB I would definitely recommend doing so! The things probably paid for its self already. I only use around .2 each time I get high now and my bud lasts so much longer. The health benefits are obvious too. Buy it,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,,t3_18gazz

The first thing I noticed was the taste.  The smoke actually tasted good!  Not harsh

The next thing I noticed was how smooth the hit was.  Now don't get me wrong, but I didn't even cough.  The second hit was harder, so I coughed a bit, but still much smoother than my bong.

After the first two hits I decided to take a break and see how high I got, I was feeling just as high off of those two hits as I was from the two bong hits that it took to completely use up the bowl in my bong.

Of course the high experience itself was different.  I know everyone says that vaporizers have a more ""heady"" high, I'll get really still, and when I move my head, the rest of my body tends to continue to feel ""paralyzed"".  With this vaporizer, my body doesn't feel like that any more.  I still get the ""get really still"" part, but when I come out of it, it's much clearer.

Then I got the best realization.  I had put less weed into this thing then I put into my bong, it was only slightly golden in some spots, lots of green still to go!  The high only lasted about 3/4 of the time it normally does with my bong, but that's more then made up by taking a few more hits near the end to keep it going.

All in all I am thoroughly amazed at this little device.  Speaking of that, but it still took me by surprise!  It's barely taller/wider then a standard bic lighter, and even a bit shorter!

In fact, now that I just thought of that, there's an option to check in to but the jar is still pretty neat and recommended. Back to the point, these cups just so happen to fit around the hole in the MFLB *perfectly,* like they were made for each other. 

This means it's easy to do ""on the go"" swaps or dump your ABV between trenches. Took a few photos to demonstrate:

I looked around for a tape measure but I couldn't find one so I took a few photos with items I'm sure you've seen/used/own. Maybe later if these don't help I can look more for a measure or if you have something else you specifically want to see

[Hope these help.](http://imgur.com/a/OC1F0)

Further, longer joints/cones/blunts will not. Each holds an 1/8th very nicely with room to view. I try to treat my buds nicely and prevent cramming them all together too tightly. I'll keep three compartments decently filled with the forth holding a brush, some nugtainers, joints or whatever and anything left stays at home until needed. I take the jar with me literally everywhere I go and I ride a motorcycle so space is always at a premium but it's just that handy and nice, especially if you have multiple strains at a time.

The compartments are not ""smell-tight"" either, even Ziplocs. I'm not overly anal about always returning the lid *immediately* after nug retrieval either, though.

**Notes:** 
I smoked quite a bit over 420, when this begins. My tolerance is probably low-moderate, and I primarily use the MFLB (though over the weekend I smoked, ate, vaped a plethora of ways). 

The following is completely unedited

Hit 13: (12:27)
Tasty. Okay guys

Hit 14: (12:29)
nice hit. steadily climbing now. typing becoming a task. I'm  not playing any music, I'm doing just an okay job of typing this and talking to my friend. I sound so high. [6.89532]

Hit 18: (

__________________________________

The night did not end at Hit 18, time seemed much slower over this whole process.

As you can see, my trenches are about .1g at the most, I probably vaped about .28 grams in total last night. 

Conclusion

Hope this accomplished something.

3. Inhale slowly through your mouth.  You will feel like you are only drawing air from around the box, it is almost impossible to pull too much air into the box and cool the screen.  It IS possible to combust while doing this, so go ahead and get done with it but just not too fast.

4. Hold it for a count of 3 (2 seconds, just a little.  Once again, if you see vapor then top off your lungs with air.  Do this only a couple times.

it DOES NOT use alkaline batteries, but works best with 2400+mAh high discharge batteries.  
and why do you list night vision as not being available? it has nothing to do with a vaporizer ... at all.  
i field many questions about these inequities in your listing. you get accused of selling knockoffs quite a lot because of this, and at very good prices. i think your sales might improve a bit if this was corrected, because when people who know about the box read your listing, they just pass you by as cashing in on MFLB's quality and selling a knockoff.  
we'd both benefit from a few corrections. me

Each trench I pack is usually 0.2g. So now $55/3.5g = 15.7 bucks per g. Now 15.7/5 = 3.14 bucks per trench. But really it only takes half a trench to get me to a (6). So really its $1.57 for a good session with my MFLB. But here comes the kicker. I save the AVB and make brownies with them. So for 1g each brownies I get 3.5 brownies every 1/8th. I sell the brownies for ~$8/each at parties and whatnot therefore I make $28 back per 1/8.

I'm going to take out all of the boring math and tell you that since I sell brownies back out and my net cost is decreased from 55 to $27

And this is why the MFLB stands for Mother Fucking Loveable Beast.

Use this thread to post your ninja stories and provide some tips on how to be more stealthy with your vape.

**My tip for stealth native vaporizing:** Do not hold the MFLB between your thumb and forefinger. Instead, or just holding your hand to your face. If you do this well enough, the only angle from which the MFLB will be visible is from the bottom. I use this trick to vape on the bus.

1332530950.0,rae7v,Got an MFLB yesterday. Have had Volcano for years...my thoughts.,Anon08764,55,5,33,"I have no idea how to cross post

I've had a volcano for years.  I'm a weekend vapehead.  Generally about once, so on occasion, right before bed I would fire up my proto-pipe from the bedside table and take a couple of hits and knock myself out for the night.

My wife

I'm a complete geek and love gadgets

So, ground nice and fine and fill up a couple of balloons for my wife and I and we'll have a great evening of watching movies (we are partial to comedy and action/adventure or sci-fi) or TV (we generally stick to comedy for our Volcano nights, Community, Black Books, The IT Crowd, Happy Endings, Psych, but it is AWESOME. WAY better than microwave and over time it pays for itself since the kernels are way cheaper).

I love having the fine grain control over the heat that the Volcano provides (I have the analog version

Now, but the second was good and the third pretty much perfect.  Great job on the instructions guys!  I'm sure that for a new Ent it would be a bit trickier but I've got over 20 years of toking behind me so it wasn't hard to figure out.  

I found the little LED to be a key component as it let me know exactly when I was actually heating the element and when i had released.  The quality of the high was great

I was surprised by how small the device is

All of that said, the MFLB is one helluva nice little vaporizer.  At that price point, I'm not sure that you could do better.  The company was fast, responsive and the whole package is great (the storage tin is a great replacement for the tupperware container that I was using in my nightside table). 

I found it easy to use, so I'll probably just get slightly more powerful baked goods out of the deal, which isn't a bad thing!

I'm happy to answer any questions anyone may have.  Big thumbs up from me on the MFLB.  I'm planning on getting my GGG dealer an MFLB for Christmas.",self,t5_2rs76,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mflb/comments/rae7v/got_an_mflb_yesterday_have_had_volcano_for/

Again

The thing is if you've gotten to that point already then your room already smells like weed and the popcorn smell isn't going to cover it up



I always read people using the MFLB in theatres and libraries and such. I can't imagine doing that

Now, the smell is very easy to avoid. Here's my tip, as long as you exhale the vapor through a sploof or a sweater or even if you just put a towel under your door, you're golden. Vapor is much easier to control than stinky smoke which emanates everywhere.

-----------

**11:15** - I arrive at my friends (Liam) house to pick him up

**11:25** - We both arrive at the train station and park our car. The best part about edibles is that you don't really have to hide it

**11:35** - Train leaves the station and we begin our 40 minute journey into the city. Our station is at the end of the line

**11:40** - Train arrives at the second station, so I make sure to eat fast. Once I'm done with mine he begins to devour his. 

**11:46** - Sandwiches are both consumed.

**12:10** - After much waiting I think I'm starting to feel something

**12:20** - We get off at our train stop and I definately feel it in the background now. I was probably about a [2], and his [0] has begin to rise.

**12:30** - We made it to the ferry port and we see that it's about 10 minutes away which is great, as we noticed each others behavior change a little.

**12:44** - The ferry arrives and we head onto it. I feel a little uncomfortable getting on

**12:46** - We hear the ferrys engine fire up, all of it.  Somehow we begin a conversation about why they put a ferry service along this small lake, and why they didn't just put a bridge along it.

**12:49** - We are almost off the ferry began to discuss just how wierd of a creature jellyfish are. I mean

**12:50** - We head off the train and start the 2 minute walk to the zoo!

**12:53** Liam wants to stop for a cigarette before we go in as you can't smoke in the zoo. We sit down on a nice bench right near the entrance

**12:58** Liam is half way through his cigarette and we are both very eagerly awaiting the zoo. It's safe to say we're both floating around a [4] at this point. 

**1:00** - We pay our entry fee and enter the zoo. We are both pretty high at this point, something that I would normally enjoy. However, we were both pretty paranoid and didn't want to give it away. We really just wanted to get the map and leave.

**1:02** - After deciphering the map we decided to start at the reptile house and move on up through the zoo. I noticed that the zoo was cleverly laid out in a way that you could pretty much take one route through the zoo and get through all of the exhibits.

**1:05** - Inside the reptile house there are plenty of snakes. We got very wierded out by one snake who was standing himself up, they were just so ridiculously slow, dopey and chilled. As we are watching them, the 2 turtles that have been hanging around each other all of the sudden swim toward one another and hold hands, then they swim around in a circle while they are hanging onto each other. ""DUDE THEYRE HOLDING HANDS"" says liam. Yep, we were both pretty in awe of the turtles after that.

**1:15** - Upon exiting the reptile house we are greeted with the warm sun rays on our face, elephants etc) to last, to make sure we see them around the peak of our edible high. But before the bushwalk we needed to graze through the wetlands first!

**1:20** - Inside the wetlands is a strange feeling, the birds are not the main attraction of this area. Our zoo has a really old, gigantic croc which we were pumped for. Once we got to his tank, he was nowhere to be seen! Then we notice a sign that says he is in a reserve area while his habitat is being cleaned out. We go through the door where it directs us, and find him in an outside grasses area with a pool, basking in the sun! He looked so wierdly scary and we were talking to each other about how crocodiles are basically nightmare fuel, this guy was insanely muscley and evil looking at the time. Pretty cool. 

**1:40** - We begin our journey through the Australian Walkabout. No animals are really exciting to us, which you hardly ever see them do! Liam also pointed out how we had found another animal that smokes daily.

**2:00** - After a very long walk through the Australian section

**2:20** - We start making our way back towards the main area because we are both very hungry at this point. We get side tracked by a sign that directs us toward the Numbats. We really needed to see what a numbat looked like in real life

**2:25** - We grab a bite to eat. The zoo food was horrible and overpriced

**2:35** - We begin making our way through the area, and we chatted for a while about how similar they are to humans, and how smart they actually are. We notice a few people with DSLR Cameras, and after a few minutes of decoding the situation we come to the conclusion that the old guy taking photos actually has a photography class with him, and is teaching them. Then out of fucking nowhere, the old guy starts making weird noises and waving his arms, in an attempt to wind the crowd of Baboons up. The first time he does it they all get very very hostile and aggressive toward the man, because that's looks like what they wanted to do. We watch for a little longer while the photographer keeps making weird noises

1349655613.0,1141kk,The Amazing Efficiency of the Launch Box,tyzon05,56,10,20,"The MFLB has really helped me conserve and save quite a lot of money.  It's really amazing how this little box can pay for itself.  

before owning the MFLB I had similar patterns of consumption to those I have now.  I would smoke a bowl before bed on the weekdays and one to two on the weekends.  For the sake of the math I'll overestimate and say 10 bowls per week.  With an average bowl size of .25g that's 2.5g a week and 10g a month.

After buying the MFLB I've slowly transitioned into the patterns I have now.  I still consume 9-10 times per week, overestimating slightly to get a maximum), and I now consume half a trench per day.  (I still consume twice a day sometimes; I just use one-forth of a trench per session rather than my usual half a trench).  This adds up to .075g per session (though on twice a day days it's .0375g a session), .525g per week, and a staggering 2.1g per month.

I'm not new to cannabis; I've been partaking for several years and have enjoyed daily consumption for over a year now.  At one point, I built up a tolerance.  This goes to demonstrate that my pattern isn't only viable for those with a low tolerance.  

Let's compare the numbers for the same amount of sessions smoking and vaping. 

Average month vaping: 2.1g (~ $21 at the local dispensary).

Average month smoking: 10.0g (~ $100 at the local dispensary).

This comes out to a monthly saving of $79.  The Magic Flight Launch Box is currently on Amazon for $76.75, bud, etc. 

Now, take the plunge.  It's absolutely revolutionized how I get medicated and has overall made it a much more enjoyable process.  If you're thinking ""I couldn't possibly get medicated to the degree I want with that little cannabis"", give it a try.  I thought the same thing until I tried it and to my surprise it turned out to be really viable and save me a ton of money and bud. 

**Tl;dr:** I was able to cut my consumption down to almost 20% of what I used to consume without sacrificing any sessions for a total savings of $948 a year.  If you're on the fence about purchasing the MFLB,False,self,t5_2rs76,False,,mastermflb,t3_1141kk

An excellent seven day orbit with the MFLB. This little gadget has come in very handy over the week and as I predicted in my earlier report, pushing the battery in with the heel of my hand while supporting the bottom with my pinky finger. The box does not need to be held level during a hit, as far as I can tell. I'd been using it native for most of the week but decided to employ the stem during the last couple of days because the hot vapor does make me cough. I'd avoided the stem because of feeling as if I had to break down the box between each hit so the stem didn't fly out as I was shaking the box to tumble the herb, but I realized I could pinch the stem between my thumb and finger as I shake the box and everything stays nice and safe and pushed together.

Last week's adventure with AVB was a flop, though, and plan to try it again with a higher dose in a couple of weeks. Will include it in the report when the time comes.

Now I've got a few trenches' worth of herb ground up and ready for this sunshine-filled afternoon and I'm planning on taking a few hours of shore leave

Cheers

My roommate picked me up and instead of heading to our apartment

However

It all started when I had to crutch up a flight of stairs to find a bathroom. As I was passing the first bedroom at the top of the stairs I was offered trees by a guy chilling on the bed. I had just dipped out of a lengthy conversation outside

After returning from the can, and we invited others to join as they walked by. After a nice sesh, we headed downstairs and back outside to join the rest of the party. After heading inside slightly buzzed and full off bbq, getting lifted and then returning back outside into the beautiful late may day...it was almost reminiscent to when Dorothy and Toto, open the door to Munchkinland, and everything turns to color from black and white. (and I hope everyone starting hearing ""Money"" - Pink Floyd in their heads after I painted that picture) 

I immediately walked up to a group of guys that were friends with one of the people that joined the sesh after me in the house. They were all from the midwest and were visiting a buddy of theirs that lived in town. Somehow the topic of trees came up

Side note...I had been a regular redditor for about 6 months

Back to party...I asked the group of new found fri**ENTs** if they had every heard of a ""Magic Flight Launch Box"" before. The guy that lived in town spoke up and said, why would you give it away so easily?"" He explained that he had just accepted a job in Europe and was moving indefinitely in a week and needed to get rid of it. (Hence why his friends were in town to party) He told me that he was planning on just leaving it on the street, hoping that someone would find and enjoy it.

After exchanging numbers and beginning to coordinate the hand off, are you guys redditors?"" Everyone of their eyes lit up and proclaimed a collective ""Yea!"" Needless to say this immediately bonded and a great time was had by all. One of the highlights of the discussion regarding reddit, was when my new found fri**ENT** told me this was his first random run-in with a redditor. He said he was feeling relieved very that not all redditors were ""basement dwellers"" haha. 

The real highlight was discussing what we thought the reddit philosophy was. Personally, we make up for it by helping those in need, giving advice and encouragement to those who are down in the dumps and we are the most clever and hilarious people on the planet. 

We identified that this whole magical story embodied everything that we thought ""reddit is.""

Anyways, hoping to meet up for a beer or sesh when he returned to the states. I told him I was only borrowing the MFLB from him, and he could have it back anytime. I crutched back to my buddy's car who was chauffeuring my crippled a$$ all over town. I opened that shiny black box, and sure enough everything was there, in great condition. I assumed it was going to be at least a little beat up and maybe missing the brush or battery caps etc. But sure enough it was all there, and it was all mine...for free thanks to this chance encounter with a really cool guy and reddit.

I hope you enjoyed this story, trees and MFLB's ever since.

This new year's resolution was to finally get rid of my tobacco dependence and use the MFLB as my only method of getting high. I'd heard good things about the PA but it always seemed crazy expensive and I thought that the batteries (Powerex 2700s) were fit for purpose. Man I was wrong.

I ordered the PA from the official Magic Flight site on Boxing Day with the cheapest shipping option. I was totally surprised when it arrived yesterday. Build quality is very high and after 5-10 minutes with it, the vape thicker and so much more potent. Usually, with batteries, the MFLB takes me to a [4] and keeps me there unless I force myself to do 2-3 trenches in quick succession. After 1 trench with the PA I hit at least a steady [6] and after another half trench I was drifting off toward an [8]. I've never reached those levels without burning weed in a bong or a spliff.

Before the influx of third lung posts

The third lung defies all this logic.  Seems like the purpose is to take a monster rip.  And if that is NOT the purpose (and you are just sipping from the lung)

So

EDIT:  Exhaling most of the THC and having it condense in the third lung is my wasteful idea.  If the lung is NOT really getting more high out of the herb

EDIT 2: [And what does the third lung do for the science of micro-hitting (see MFLB's post and graphs halfway down the page)](http://fuckcombustion.com/threads/the-magic-flight-box.750/page-156)?

* no rolling for joints
* smellproof (no fabreeze or air vents necessary)
* super stealthy and discreet (non smokers don't know what it is)
* when your done you save the avb and eat it later.

It's 7 EST. I swallowed 6 Size 0 AVB pills at 5 o'clock. Just now I poured more in my protein shake. Total amount used I would say is almost a half of a standard pill bottle. I don't have anything to take weight measurements. I will take photos if necessary. 

7:06: A [1]. Starting to feel very faint effects in my head and arms. 

7:31: [2]. Tired. Feel like going to sleep. 

8:06: Solid [1]. Less light headed than before. 

8:38: [3]. I feel heavy. 

9:19: [6] Wow, still feeling heavier. 

9:43: [4] playing video games. Took another hit. 

10:23: [2] well that was fun. Certainly expected it to last longer. Might hit a trench tonight. For all you! Details later 

Final Edit: 10:53: [2] Feeling great now. Real relaxed. Overall, nice. I would imagine that I could save this for long days without access to a vape, but I am certainly disappointed it didn't last longer, or take so much to have an effect.

1375290086.0,1jfjqu,[Tutorial] How to get the perfect grind consistency.,lobwege,38,1,14,"Everyone wants kief to vape. Well

Step 1: Grind bud. If you have a 4 piece grinder, thus making it finer. For people with 2 piece grinders, you don't need to worry. The longer you grind your bud the better.
If you don't have a grinder

Step 2: Put the ground bud in a small plastic container. Film canisters work great

Step 3: Clean a coin off (I use rubbing alcohol; coins are *very* dirty). Then put the coin in the small container with the weed. 

Step 4: Shake. Shake it as hard and long as you can.

Step 5: Take the entire container and put it in the freezer. If you live in a non-ent friendly house

Step 6: Take out container and shake again. This time shake longer

You will now have a powder like consistency. It is amazing to vape. Honestly comparable to kief

Now that I've been implementing it for a week I wish I hadn't waited so long. Superior draw (I prefer native, with a very satisfactory result. Also uses less herb than combustion devices. The stealth factor is also a huge plus. I used the LB in my ship-to-surface shuttle on several occasions during the week. Think the one-hitter might be a thing of the past for me.
