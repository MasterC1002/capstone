I'm Alex Hirsch, and rocks thrown through my window with questions written on them by fans. The most common question I get is ""Are you Mr. Tumnus, the goat-man from the Narnia movies? Can you let me into the snowy wonderland that lies beyond your enchanted wardrobe?""

The answer to this question, no matter how strange! A few TIPS

*BE SPECIFIC! THE MORE SPECIFIC the question

*Try to BE ORIGINAL! I've done like a zillion interviews already

*BE SHORT! The shorter it is

*I'm 100% more likely to answer your question if you only ask ONE

*SPOILER QUESTIONS will either be ignored or responded to with an image of an axlotl

My cartoon (""work"") recently got on the front page of reddit somehow and a few people seemed interested in me doing an AMA. I'm in! Let's do this thing!

Ever wonder about those weird hairs on Grunkle Stan's shoulders?
Wanna know that one goat's name?
Wanna know horrifying personal details about Alex Hirsch?

I got answers!

Now. This pretty much *proves* that Stan had a twin brother who isn't around anymore.

Furthermore both the glasses Stan takes from the room *and* the symbol on his hat are in [this](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-6I-Ha7FJzLY/T-fywuZHSyI/AAAAAAAAIlw/qkaeHnVqw1E/s1600/STAN.jpg) picture. I think that these symbols are kinda like family crests and each one follows a specific bloodline through life. One part of my theory is that Stan, and some other characters were apart of a secret society that knew about the secrets of Gravity Falls. But when Stan's twin got too far deep into the mystery he died and with that the rest of the members were too scared to move on in the adventure and with that Dipper and Mabel's parents didn't pass their symbol down to their kids.

It would explain why there were so many odd things in the secret room. It could've been Stanley's old room and with him being so involved in the mysteries he kept some things.

What do you guys think of my theory? I'd like to think it's pretty solid.",nsfw,t5_2udb8,1365029291.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/gravityfalls/comments/1bm6hx/stanley_and_stanford_spoilers/

**ORIGINAL**

Here it goes:
Do you guys remember the [carpet](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/cd/S1e16_experiment_78.png) in ""Carpet Diem?"" Well

What I am saying is that I think that that could possibly be a different version of Stan. Now, of course when Stan goes into the hidden room he pics up a pair of [glasses.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/6/6a/S1e16_what_are_Stan%27s_glasses_in_the_secret_room.....hmm....png) He looks at them and then is seen later in the episode looking at them and thinking as well. They are also the same glasses seen by this guy in ""The Time Traveler's Pig.""

Now, Stan and another person (possibly his brother as stated in other theories) switched bodies and for some reason are no longer the same. 

The reason this occurred to me was when I was re-watching ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel."" Around [13 minutes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/0/03/S1e4_stan_is_fat.png) into the episode, I got this shirt! ...ugh I am fat."" Then, Mabel runs away screaming and Stan screams, ""bodies change honey...bodies change."" Let me know what you guys think!

**Update for ""Dreamscaperers""**

In this episode we see many age versions of Stan ([example 1](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/ce/S1e19_It_sucks..png)). Throughout the episode we can see his different features. Try and pay close attention to the nose

My belief regarding this is that it can be one of two things:
     1. It is Dipper in the future/past (""the future is in the past
     2. It is Stan's brother/twin that he switched places with in the ""Carpet Diem"" episode. (An extra possibility on this is that he is in some sort of alternative dimension.
     3. Lastly, this man is not wearing a fez. 

**Bill Cipher (A.K.A. ACE)**

Bill clearly knows Stan. It is apparent when Gideon mentions his name in the first place and mumbles ""Stan Pines...."" He also [changes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/1/12/S1e19_Stan%27s_full_tatoo.png) and we can see Stan's full tattoo. This shows that he is aware of the tattoo and most likely knows about its origins. My only theory on this is that it is related to the secret society along with Bill himself. 

He also changes to show an [angry Stan reaching towards something](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/8/8d/S1e19_stan_pines....png). I think this suggests that Stan was involved in some sort of battle with Bill. I assume this has to do with the secret society as well.

* Gideon is the only child with 4 fingers. I know

* He dresses like an old man with a suit instead of more normal clothes a kid would wear. There was a time when men wore suits and that's exactly what he does.

* When Mabel rubs Soos' Grandma's face, rubs Gideon's hand he says his skin is soft and asks if he moisturizes.

It all started when Stanley and Stanford were born as twins. Growing up in GF they noticed all the weird things happening and probably formed a group to look into the weird thing that was sabotaged from the inside (hence don't trust anyone).

* **The Carpet Diem Theory:** 

Do you guys remember the [carpet](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/cd/S1e16_experiment_78.png) in ""Carpet Diem?"" Well

What I am saying is that I think that that could possibly be a different version of Stan. Now, of course when Stan goes into the hidden room he pics up a pair of [glasses.](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/6/6a/S1e16_what_are_Stan%27s_glasses_in_the_secret_room.....hmm....png) He looks at them and then is seen later in the episode looking at them and thinking as well. They are also the same glasses seen by this guy in ""The Time Traveler's Pig.""

Now, Stan and another person (possibly his brother as stated in other theories) switched bodies and for some reason are no longer the same. 

The reason this occurred to me was when I was re-watching ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel."" Around [13 minutes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/0/03/S1e4_stan_is_fat.png) into the episode, I got this shirt! ...ugh I am fat."" Then, Mabel runs away screaming and Stan screams, ""bodies change honey...bodies change."" **This is one version of the twin theory and more or less explains it. Please comment any alterations!**


* **Here are the updated theories for ""Dreamscaperers."" This includes some minor alterations to the twin theory as well.**


In this episode we see many age versions of Stan ([example 1](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/ce/S1e19_It_sucks..png)). Throughout the episode we can see his different features. Try and pay close attention to the nose

My belief regarding this is that it can be one of two things:
     1. It is Dipper in the future/past (""the future is in the past
     2. It is Stan's brother/twin that he switched places with in the ""Carpet Diem"" episode. (An extra possibility on this is that he is in some sort of alternative dimension.
     3. Lastly, this man is not wearing a fez. 



* **Here is my theory on Bill Cipher:**


Bill clearly knows Stan. It is apparent when Gideon mentions his name in the first place and mumbles ""Stan Pines...."" He also [changes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/1/12/S1e19_Stan%27s_full_tatoo.png) and we can see Stan's full tattoo. This shows that he is aware of the tattoo and most likely knows about its origins. My only theory on this is that it is related to the secret society along with Bill himself. 

He also changes to show an [angry Stan reaching towards something](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/8/8d/S1e19_stan_pines....png). I think this suggests that Stan was involved in some sort of battle with Bill. I assume this has to do with the secret society as well.



 _______


Well, Gideon Rises.


____



First off



Secondly, but we do know that he knows an awful lot about it.


As far as theories go



Just as a finisher


My theory on this is that Soos is a kid trapped in an adults body. That would def. explain his personality. 


Well that's it from me! Thanks for reading and be sure to put your own theories in the thread!

At the end of the world, so Good Time Baby sees all of this from its high chair at the beginning of time. Thus, an eternal war is being waged in the Gravity Falls universe. Good Time Baby struggles against Evil Time Baby across the depths of the ages, perfectly locked in skill and strength.

Hoever

This is something that has been puzzling me for a while

First off, and has released a bunch of design sheets for characters and scenes from the show. You might even be able to figure out the mystery about the missing grappling hook by yourself ;)

One of the things you might have noticed is that *Legend of the Gobblewonker* was the first episode to be made acording to [this post](http://joedrawsstuff.tumblr.com/post/26357268683), but [another post](http://joedrawsstuff.tumblr.com/post/25581910122) shows that it is actually *107*, which is a bit later in the production.

Which brings me to my theory: The grappling hook is an item that was designed much later in the story, or they just didn't have anything else to give Mabel in episode one.

Either way, the item should be showing up again within the next two episodes.

Personally I have my fingers crossed

I'm guessing the ""handyman"" mentioned in hint #2 is Soos , #3 and #6 are obviously references to ep 19 since Gideon is looking for the deed, and Bill comes ""back"" to GF in ep 19 (he's summoned again, that is). Perhaps #5 is a reference to Dipper literally throwing fire at him at the end of the episode, or it could be a non-specific threat.

In the episode, and Soos (""the pine tree, the shooting star, and the question mark""), so it's not a large leap to the realization that the cryptograms at the end of each episode are potentially his doing. On top of that, one of the end of episode cryptograms is ""Ever noticed Stan's tattoo?"" And Bill is the only character to ever refer to Grunkle Stan as just ""Stan"" with the exception of Lazy Susan. Obviously Bill appears in almost every episode, seemingly watching the characters: his image is on a DVD cover, multiple stained glass windows, but he is also an inter-dimensional being

First off, we see a young Stan being taught to box. Cute. But, in the back corner of this image is a boy dressed just like Stan, same down to the last detail- and conspicuously holding a book in front of his face. This sparked my new theory; Stan has a twin. As soon as I thought that, I remembered seeing Stan's license plate: STNLYMBL (aka Stanley Mobile). So his real name is Stanley? No. Gideon and everyone else who has used his full name says ""Stanford."" Stanford and Stanley Pines- twins. Also, the room they find in Carpet Diem? Stanley's room. The glasses that are subtly different from Stan's? Stanley's glasses. That also ties in with the symbols on Bill's wheel for each character. Everyone's like ""why does Stan have two symbols?"" He doesn't. The moon symbol from his fez is for Stan- and the glasses are for Stanley. This is evident by Stan's reaction to the glasses in Carpet Diem, which is pretty emotional

Do you guys remember the [carpet](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/c/cd/S1e16_experiment_78.png) in ""Carpet Diem?"" Well

What I am saying is that I think that that could possibly be a different version of Stan.

They are also the same glasses seen by this guy in ""The Time Traveler's Pig.""

Now, Stan and another person (possibly his brother as stated in other theories) switched bodies and for some reason are no longer the same. 

The reason this occurred to me was when I was re-watching ""The Hand That Rocks the Mabel."" Around [13 minutes](http://images.wikia.com/gravityfalls/images/0/03/S1e4_stan_is_fat.png) into the episode, I got this shirt! ...ugh I am fat.""

The only thing that bummed me out a little was that I would have liked if the voices didn't switch. One of the cool things about body swapping is that it lets actors show a bit of range by physically having to inhabit another person. Think it would have been cool to see Schaal and Ritter to do their impersonations of the other characters rather than just playing their characters in different bodies.
