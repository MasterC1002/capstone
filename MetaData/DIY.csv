I never did anything like this before but I love my mum a lot so I perhaps foolishly offered to sort her garden out.  The brief was 'low-maintenance'. I learned via the web and by asking people. 

Took about 10 weeks on my own.  The earth was clay like and full of large pieces of flintstone - i.e. impossible to get a spade in the ground...it was more like mining sometimes...scraping around embedded stones with a spoon to get them out! 

A few days I got in assistance: I got in a mini digger &amp; driver for a day

Otherwise all my own work :)

500 pics unedited version  - I can upload if there is demand

I'd like to add description to each pic explaining the materials/method but will take a long time..perhaps later..Happy to answer questions as they come for now.

The section at the side of the house where I was putting waste

The poles are treated wood 'Unilog' 125mm diameter
The patio is Indian sandstone 'Raj Green'
The fake grass (which I still need to brush upright and pour in dry sand with a mechanical brusher to get it looking its best) is from Namgrass

edit1 - I should give credit to this site http://www.pavingexpert.com/ for much useful learning and I used their service for the randomised layout design for the patio - you send them a drawing with dimensions of the space and the info on the type of 'patio pack' of stone you have (sizes of slabs, one reason is that it avoids 4 edges of stone joining to make a cross - which the eye gets drawn to, in a bad way. When I learned this I was amazed to see how many pro portfolios had examples of this. Also a long line of edges - over2/3metres is bad news aesthetically.  Another layout option for these patio packs would have been to follow a fixed random pattern map from the supplier or elsewhere - that can be ok but they only give it for a small area - so for a larger area you have to repeat the pattern.

edit 2 - I used this site http://www.freecycle.org/ a lot to re-purpose un-needed things like the wood crates the stone came in

1354286284.0,141wo1,I ripped the old carpet off my stairs and painted a runner.  I think it turned out pretty good.,shiner_man,2172,652,207,"[Picture Album](http://imgur.com/a/mupoO)

So last Saturday I decided to rip the [old maroon nasty carpet](http://i.imgur.com/qEDBS.jpg) off my steps because I was tired of looking at it.  My original plan was to sand the steps down and re-stain them.  I quickly realized that it was going to take forever to sand all of the steps down so that they looked decent enough to stain.  It probably would have cost me $30 in sandpaper because the stairs had a bunch of [nasty glue and all sorts of crap](http://i.imgur.com/oDV9n.jpg) adhered to them.  So it was on to plan B - paint them.

I prepped the treads by sanding all of them down with 60 grit sandpaper using a belt sander.  The goal was to [get all of the nasty stuff off the treads](http://i.imgur.com/0GWcg.jpg) so that the paint would go on with a somewhat smooth finish.

After that, paint the entire tread and don't leave out the middle part like I did.  It just forces you to put more coats of paint on later.

From here

After marking the middle of the steps

With all of the marking done

Now with all of the treads taped

Also

Let me just point out that to say all of this taping was a pain in the ass would be an understatement.  It's extremely tedious and it took a while to do.  You're also bent over in a weird position or sitting on hard steps most of the time.  It wasn't fun.

Anyway

Of course

I let the paint dry for about 10 hours and then began ripping the tape off.  There isn't much strategy to this other than going slow and stopping if the tape starts to pull off any paint.  3M recommends running an exacto knife on the tape line if that starts to happen but it didn't for me (perhaps because I ""sealed"" the tape by painting over it like 3M recommended).  There were however two spots that the tape pulled up some of the white paint underneath but that was an easy touch-up repair.

[Here it is with all of the tape removed](http://i.imgur.com/rawtM.jpg).  

The next step is to put some type of water-based polyurethane over all of the steps to protect the paint but I'm going to wait a few weeks to do that so that the paint can really cure.  Behr says it takes 4 weeks for their enamel based paints to cure.

Of course, the walls look yellow.

The total cost for all of this was approximately $60.

*  1 Quart Behr Ultra in California Dreaming - $19.99
*  1 Quart Behr Ultra in Decorators White (Benjamin Moore Color) - $19.99
*  Painters Tape - $9
*  Sandpaper - $7
*  Paintbrush - $6

Last winter my brother called me to tell me that my parents neighbor had passed away and that his kids were there at his house selling all his stuff AND that one of the things was this old sad tiny boat called an Addictor (1985) and wanted to know if I wanted it. I said no, I just didnt have time for another thing to do. So a week later I go to my parents house and as I pull into the driveway, there sits this boat. My brother had bought it for $400. As soon as I saw it I realized I had made a mistake. This thing was super cool, or at least could be with some work. Long story short, my brother regretted buying it as he has no place to work on it, so I bought it from him right there for the $400 he paid. I drug it home and started in on it that day. After a good pressure washed my girlfriend and I accessed the situation. We had no idea if the motor ran, the seat was completed rotted, really everything had to be replaced or repaired from what we could see. After tearing out the seat, installed all new steering, carpet

1345645721.0,ymzyd,How can Samsung get away with this? Enrage level:10/10,randysgoiter,1526,628,680,"To preface my story

I arrived home from a few drinks with friends and decided I would unwind and watch some tv. I turn it on

The next day I unplugged everything from the tv and after about 5 minutes it starts to strobe again. At this point I got a really bad feeling inside and $2000 started strobing in my head. I decide to do some research online and see that this is a common problem. Common as in thousands of people have expressed concern over this but a lot of them got it fixed inside the warranty period. 

I call Samsung and they basically laugh at me. It has been two and a half years and my $2000 dollar tv is no longer working. They say they can not do anything and they have never heard of this problem before. I explain that there are people voicing this exact problem all over the internet and there is no way they have not heard of this. They send me to some customer complaint department that gives me the same runaround. 

So I'm sitting there with a strobing tv and Samsung not giving a shit and telling me to contact a repairman from their repair department or maybe some contract company they use to service their tv's. I don't remember because my blood was boiling at this point. I gave them a piece of my mind

I start to read some more reviews online and FINALLY stumble upon a [youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZwQ0gRQ9sg) that explains what the problem is and how to fix it. The most enraging part about this is it took me 15 minutes total to fix the issue. The longest part was unscrewing the television and insuring it's safety. Clipping the jumper literally took 3 seconds once it was easily located.

Even more maddening is in those same reviews when a repair man came in he fixed it the exact same way I did except charged 300 dollars or more. How can this be happening?

I posted this to vent but also to save anyone with the same problem the hundreds of dollars it would cost to fix a problem you can fix yourself in less than 20 minutes. This happens on 55"" and 46"" LCD TV's.

I used to love Samsung. I have 2 LCD's

TL;DR Samsung knows there is a problem inside their TV's. Won't take responsibility for it,False,,t5_2qh7d,False,,,t3_ymzyd

[Here's an album of some of the work in progress](http://imgur.com/a/S5UCU#55)

* The first thing I did was clean the outside of the cabinet with a 1:10 vinegar/water solution
* Next, name board, the action and keys. It took all of 6 screws, and 3 nuts to remove all of these parts. Be sure to disconnect the lever that attaches to the inner-workings of the damper pedal before lifting out the action.
* Next, and vacuumed it up. The inside of the cabinet, and the holes in the harp still needed to be wiped down with a vinegar/water solution to get it â€˜dust freeâ€™. I also used compressed air to gently clean dust from all the action parts, as they are very fragile, and I didnâ€™t have the hundreds to thousands of dollars to replace all the hammers and other action parts. 
* Next, excluding the harp, tuning pins and strings. I replaced the key pin, and balance pin punchings, and adjusted them accordingly. 
* Next, or keys warping, and no longer fitting back into the piano. If they donâ€™t need to be cleaned (ie, having something sticky spilled on them), I suggest just wiping down the ivory/ebony or acrylic and drying with a cotton cloth.
* Next, and just placing it felt side down on a flat surface to dry. 
* The piano was then re-assembled in reverse order. It was also tuned, and a few things I'm likely forgetting...!

Next: to create a piano bench...

It seems to me that everyone that posts pretty pictures of something they built gets a great deal of attention and upvotes.  Meanwhile those who post questions get almost no attention

I have taken to going down the line and upvoting every legitimate question or interesting article link

Am I wasting my time? Do I have the wrong expectation of this group? Should I migrate to r/crafts or something?

Just wanted to vent and or hear your ideas.


Oh

Thank you

1360203423.0,181fak,My wife and I decided to build our own house this past summer.,,589,109,117,"After 5 years living in an old 650 sqft house with no basement

We worked on the house Mondays - Thursdays from 6 am -1 pm and then went to work from 3 pm - 11 pm. Fridays  and Saturdays we had off from work so we worked on the house from 6 am - 8 pm. Sundays I worked mid day so we did not work on the house.


My wife, and myself did almost everything. The only things we did not do is the shingles, installing the furnace and ducting, and the drywall mudding and taping. My brother-law- is a certified electrician  so he was nice enough to do the electrical. We got a great deal on garage and driveway pouring so we did not do that. Other wise we did everything else.

It took only 6 months from the day we demolished the old house to the day we moved in to the new house.

Here is the album. They are not up to date
http://homebuild.imgur.com


Edit: I have update the album with the last of the pictures that we have taken.
I should have mentioned that my wife and I are not carpenters by trade. I work with computers and she works as  a health care aid. We did not know what we where getting into when we started.


Edit: We are not quite done the outside. It got to cold to do any of the masonry. Under the Green siding

We did work off of a plan that my father-in-law had.

For us who rarely used a hammer before this it was quite neat...all be it stressful. This is how the build went;
show up at site.....get told what we need to do for the day. Father - in - law would usually have to go to work for a few hours

People would asked what we are doing next

I got to say looking back i really had fun building the house
