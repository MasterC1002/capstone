8 oz steak sauce (A1 or any off brand is fine)
4 oz of honey
1.5 tsp Sriracha or other hot pepper sauce
2 cloves garlic - minced
1 tsp garlic powder (if you don't have fresh garlic use 2 tsp garlic powder)

Mix the sauces and garlic/garlic powder together and pour it over the chicken breasts in the slow cooker.

Cook it on high for 2.5 hours and then gear it down to low for 4.5 hours.

Remove the now exceptionally tender and fall apart wonderful chicken breasts from the slow cooker

Use 2 forks to pull the chicken and return to the slow cooker and the delicious sauce.

Let the chicken and the sauce co-mingle for a half hour or so and dig in.

1371496329.0,1gj7sk,Recently Joined - thought I would share my retired competition chili recipe,tambor333,322,47,58,"The beanless / non slow cooker version of this has won 5 competitions in the bay area over the years before I retired it. Current recipe below has won many ad hoc “ chili cook-offs and hot lucks"" sponsored by my companies and church since adapting it for a slow cooker. Some might note that this looks similar to America's test kitchen's chili

The anchos chiles and the browned tomato paste give it an earthy flavor and deep mahogany color. You can play with the heat a bit but don’t skip the chipotle or anchos since they are flavor components.

California Wildfire with Black Beans 

* 2 ½ lbs. Beef Chuck boned
* 6 thick cut or 12 thin cut rashers of bacon diced 
* 1 large white or yellow onion chopped fine 
* 7 – 10 cloves of Garlic smashed and chopped fine 
* 10 to 12 Dried Ancho chiles 
* 2 or 3 dried or fresh whole cayenne chilies ( Can be any hot variety ) 
* 3 Serrano fresh chiles chopped fine ( Can be any hot variety ) 
* 1 Tablespoon Chipotle powder 
* 3 Tablespoon Tomato Paste 
* 2 Tablespoons Cumin seeds 
* 2 Tablespoons Mexican Oregano 
* 2 Tablespoons honey ( optional ) 
* 1 Small Can Swanson’s beef stock ( low sodium ) 
* 24 Oz Cevesa Tecate beer ( room temp ) For those with alcohol sensitivity use 2 O’douls amber or other non alcoholic malt beverages 
* 2 small cans black beans rinsed and drained 
* 1 cup Masa Harina (Corn Flour) 
* Salt and Pepper 

Preheat your oven to 375˚ F. Toast your dried chiles for 5 to 7 minutes on a sheet pan then soak in warm water to re hydrate. Cube Beef into ½ inch cubes set aside. In a bowl or zip top bag mix 1 cup masa harina and salt and pepper then coat the beef cubes knocking off the excess. In a large Pan render the diced bacon. Remove bacon to the slow cooker and brown the beef in small batches

Add Salt and pepper to taste. Optional: add a little honey to round out the flavors if the chiles are a little bitter. The sauce if loose can be tightened with some more masa harina. Top with grated cheese

Variations: Add cubed pork butt for deeper flavor. Try a sweeter beer like Newcastle brown or ale. Almost any chile will work in this as well. Add 2 oz of dark chocolate for a mole type flavor.

Edit: fixed the spelling of Tecate

1359664800.0,17nert,The only Pulled Pork recipe you'll ever need,sirkerrald,254,58,84,"I've been making this one for several years. It's super simple

**1 4-5lb Pork Butt/Shoulder**

**2 Large White or Yellow Onions** (larger the better)

**1 Bottle your favorite bbq sauce** (Personally, Jack Daniel's No.7 is my choice of the moment. Also worth trying with Jamaican Jerk, comes out incredibly well).

**1 Tea Spoon Liquid Smoke** (if you don't plan on using a smokey style sauce... let's face it

**1 Cup Ginger Beer or Ginger Ale** (save a little extra too)

**Dry rub mix** (currently I use Bad Byron's Butt Rub).



Slice both onions and layer the bottom of the slow cooker with one of the onions. Add your ginger beer/ale, layer with remaining onions, sprinkle with dry rub and add a bit of moisture with a bit of additional ginger beer/ale. Cover, and let cook over night on **LOW** for 12 hours.

By now you'll see that the meat pulls apart almost effortlessly. Technically you're good to go, add your sauce, and stick it back in the slow cooker for another 4-6 hours. In that time your pork will come out as tender, moist, and flavorful as any you've experienced.

**[Chipotle Chicken Tacos](http://imgur.com/a/ZACCu)**

__Ingredients__

-	`2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breast`
-	`Small can (7.5oz) of chipotle peppers in adobo sauce`
-	`1 bottle (16oz) of medium chunky salsa`
-	`2 bell peppers (I used half of the 4 of each color)`
-	`1 small sweet onion (I used ¾ of the one pictured)`
-	`1 whole head/bulb of garlic`
-	`1 can of corn`
-	`1 can of black beans`
-	`2 ½ tablespoons of taco seasoning`
-	`1 tablespoon of cumin`
-	`1 tablespoon of paprika`
-	`Lime juice`
-	`Cilantro`
-	`Salt/Pepper`
-	`Olive oil`


1.) Start by emptying the whole bottle of salsa into the slow cooker.

2.) Get the strainer out and strain the can of corn under water and add that to the pot.

3.) Then chop up your onions and peppers and add those to the pot as well. I liked to keep them in strips instead of dicing them.

4.) Next

5.) Then I added enough lime juice into the processor to just not quite submerge the garlic cloves. I don’t know if it’s bad to use this much/little of lime juice

6.) Then open your can of chipotle peppers. I’m not sure how many comes in a can but I used about 8 peppers and a couple spoonfuls of the adobo sauce contained therein. I think that’s pretty much the whole can

7.) If you’re using fresh cilantro you can add it to the processor at this point. My grocery store only had dried

8.) Now process that sh*t! I do it long enough to where the garlic pieces look like minced garlic contained in a delicious crimson chipotle liquid. Mmmmmm.

9.) Now add that to the slow cooker along with your spices (taco seasoning, cilantro, salt/pepper, olive oil). I don’t add much salt since most everything has it already in it. As for the olive oil, I just pour an “S” shape inside the bowl. Just enough so that the oil will become infused with all the flavors, and melt into the food later when we shred the chicken.

10.) Now for the chicken. I did a bit of trimming just to get any excess fat off (some is good)

11.) I put it on high for the first 2 hours

12.) Before the last hour though

13.) Get out your strainer again and strain the black beans under some water. Then add to the slow cooker.

14.) Keep it on low for that last hour and then you’re done! 


*---- I don’t add any water to the pot when I make this because by the time you’re halfway done, when I re-heat the stuff before putting it in a tortilla, I cook/heat it in a [pan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dt-zz4LcxX8) so it can reduce most of the liquid away so it's not too drippy. I put cheese and sour cream on the tacos and pieces of avocado if I’m feeling rich. This is my first recipe on here and was inspired by a previous [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/18fx90/trying_out_my_new_slowcooker/) someone made. You could probably turn this into a chip dip too if you added cheese and sour cream to the slow cooker halfway. My roommate puts it on a half of a baked sweet potato if you don't like tortillas. Whatever floats your boat i guess. I hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do! Lots of leftovers and satisfied bellies :)*

I'd never used a gas oven before going to China so my first thirty attempts often started small catastrophes.

I decided the easiest thing to do would be buying a slow cooker so I could just toss things into a pot with ease and live on simple soups and stews.

I'd bought a slow cooker back home

I'm not a fool

The main issue with my slow cooker (a gen-u-wine crock pot) was that it had no indicator light. Plug and Pray if you will. I plugged it in

After an hour - nothing. The thing was unusually cool to the touch but I figured

It was still cold by the second hour so I checked that everything was plugged in. When I removed the cord from my adapter there was a huge spark

I have no idea why my adapter (that had worked fine for my N64 days earlier) decided it didn't like my slow cooker.

I want to thank you all for giving me hope with a lot of great recipes and ideas. You're a cool community but my kitchen gremlins won't let me join.

1366589447.0,1ctxqf,Voodoo Child Chicken,noillusions,129,17,23,"[Here](http://www.food.com/recipe/voodoo-child-chicken-77032) is the inspiration for this dish. I was trying to find a copy of J.Gumbos voodoo chicken and had little success. I finally came across this recipe and set about adapting it for a slow cooker. Its not J.Gumbos but I really enjoy it. 


Notable changes:
Use only 1/4 tsp of the thyme and oregano. After being in the slow cooker they tend to over power it a bit. 
I also use a small can of petite diced tomatoes or rotel rather than paste. 

Recipe I used:

4 boneless

4 tablespoons butter

3 cloves garlic

1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper

1 teaspoon paprika

1/4 teaspoon thyme

1/4 teaspoon oregano

1/2 teaspoon parsley


1/2 teaspoon garlic powder

1/2 bay leaf

1/4-1/2 dried chili

1/2 teaspoon seasoning salt

1 TBS Tabasco sauce (or hot sauce of choice)

2 teaspoons brown sugar

1 small can of petite diced tomatoes or rotel

optiona
l
1 can of whole kernel corn

1 can of black beans


Place everything in the slow cooker except the corn and beans and set on high for 4-5 hours or low for 6-8 or until the chicken is fork tender.
 
Remove the chicken and shred then add back into the slow cooker for another hour on low. 
At the shredding stage add in the can of whole kernel corn

Serve over rice to make this a hearty meal or my favorite was is over tortilla chips topped with jalapenos
 
Enjoy

Source recipe: [MSPI Mama](http://www.mspimama.com/2012/03/slow-cooked-chicken-drumsticks-with.html)  
Line the bottom of your slow cooker with about 4-6 thighs and top with 6-8 chicken legs (or another combination of parts).  Coat with a mixture of:  
Juice and zest of one lemon  
1 Tbsp olive oil  
2 Tbsp Italian blend spices  
2 tsp garlic powder

The ingredents listed are the quantity I used but so long as the chicken is mostly covered it shouldn't make too much of a difference.

2-3 Boneless Skinless Chicken Breasts

2 cans of Cream of chicken (10.5 oz)

4 slices of Swiss cheese

1 box of chicken flavored stuffing 

Season to taste

It was very easy to make

1. Add Cream of chicken to crock pot
2. Add Chicken breasts and season them (I forgot this step and so I seasoned in step 4 YMMV)
3. Set on High for 5 hours
4. About a half hour before it is done add 1-2 slices of Swiss cheese on top of each breast.
5. Add stuffing on top spread evenly and then allow it to finish cooking for the remaining time.
6. When finished cooking place breast on a plate (or bowl) and then top with additional stuffing and sauce from the crock.

Alternately you could shred the chicken before adding the stuffing which would make it easier to eat.

I am a ""poor college student"" with no real kitchen to speak of, and vitamins to fuel my muscles.

1. Preserved lemon chicken stew with onions 

In large slow-cooker: 

a. Pour a layer of olive oil that covers the bottom of the slow cooker 
b. Slice 3-4 white or yellow onions in large circles
c. Place chicken pieces (large, but not necessary. 
d. Throw in: powdered ginger (1 tsp), turmeric (1 tsp), and black pepper (1-2 tsp). If you have fresh garlic and ginger, it's good to throw some in grated or chopped. If you have real saffron, a pinch is fantastic to add at this point, but it's not worth buying for this dish alone. 
e. If you have access to preserved lemons or have some you make around, scoop out the pulp from 1/2 lemon, and add to stew. Preserved lemons throw in a bright sour note that is fantastic.  If not, add the zest and juice of 1 medium lemon 
f. If you have fresh parsley or cilantro
f. Cover with water or chicken or veggie stock. Cook on low for 6-8 hours.  

Typically, sautee 1/2 of the onions, garlic, spices, and chicken in olive oil until onions caramelize and chicken is browned. Throw in broth and the other 1/2 of the onions, and cook at pressure for 15-20 minutes or until onions are cooked and chicken is tender. 

As with many slow-cooked recipes

Serve with bread to sop up the sauce

Ingredients: 
- Chicken (any parts

- 3+ white or yellow onions 

- Preserved lemons or 1-2 medium lemons

- Olive oil 

- Fresh garlic, and parsley (optional) 

- Chicken or vegetable stock (optional)

http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1a84xy/10_5qt_oval_digital_slow_cooker_in_stainless/

I bought one to replace a 3.5 quart cooker.  Last night I went through the first process (heat on high w water for 30 mins to clean it).  And about an hour ago I put in a 4lb roaster chicken with some seasoning and am letting it rip.  I will provide updates along the way.  This may be helpful for people to decide if this is a good value or not.  

Started on ""Low"" at 8:45am.  

9:30am - temperature of lid and stoneware pretty low after 45 minutes still.  Way cooler than my old crockpot.  Switch to high temperature.  

I will take pictures along the way and create an album later to share. Hope this will help people and I really hope it's a good cooker because $10 is such a bargain

Edit: 11:45am.  The Cooker has now been on for a total of three hours.  ""High"" is not as hot as my old crock pot (but that one would boil liquids on high).  I may be operating off of a false basis by means of comparison; possibly that cooker was TOO hot.  Regardless

Edit: 2:00pm.  I still have the cooker on high and the chicken is now cooking quite nicely.  There are lots of juices inside the pot.  There is a light boil to it.  The lid does not seem to fit quite as nicely as the lid on my old cooker

Edit: 3:30pm; DEFINITELY cooked; tried to turn with tongs and just shredded the poor bird.  Reduced heat to low and added 4 capfuls of lemon juice. 

Also worth mentioning is I am working at home today

Pictures taken at 8:45am

My concerns over its heating ability are quelled.  Good $10 buy.  

Some may say I should have made something more adventurous but for the first run out I wanted to try something very simple and basic so that I wasn't adding too many other factors in.

1355978255.0,155fwf,Since it's been requested a few times: Glögg Time!,TatonkaChief,90,23,28,"First off, and alcoholic to make sure you forget all about the winter blues. Spiced wine recipies come from all over the place - I was first introduced to it with Gluhwein from Germany. Glögg is essentially the same thing

I've gotten a few requests for a full write up of my Glögg recipe so here y'all go. Everything except the brandy can be found and WinCo too

***Glögg Time!***

First

- 1 or 2 bottles red wine (anything under $11)
- 1 bottle sherry or port (I suggest port - so sexy)
- 1 bottle brandy (anything over $11 - shitty brandy is shitty)
- 1 large orange
- 1 cup golden raisins
- 1 cup blanched silvered almonds
- 4 or 5 cinnamon sticks
~ 15 cardamom pods
- 5 cloves
~ 1/2 star anise
- brown sugar to taste (it can get wicked sweet
- Cheesecloth (unless you like playing *Old Man and the Sea* and want to fish out spices all night)

**Commandments:**


- **Step One:** Open all your liquids and pour them into your slow cooker (If you plan on driving afterwards use half the bottle of brandy - even then be careful


- **Step Two:** Wrap the clove, because the raisin are fucking **delicious** afterwards and I like to eat them by the fistful without having to pick out almond slivers). Lastly, take that orange which is undoubtedly now sitting alone and scared and peel it. Save the orange for the morning when you need vitamins and electrolytes - for the glögg you only need the peel. Toss it in. 

- **Step Three:** cook on low heat for about 2-4 hours. Depending on the quality of the spices

- **Drink responsibly and have fun.** For every glass you drink yourself

(advanced drinkers: I've put little bits of dried ginger

I think the core tricks here are frying up the onions and adding flour

**Ingredients:**

* 4 lbs chuck roast / stewing beef 
* 5 medium red potatos
* 1 lb carrots
* 3 onions
* 6 garlic cloves
* 2 cups frozen peas
* 0.25 cup tomato paste
* 1.5 cups beef broth
* 1.5 cups chicken broth
* 1 tablespoon dried minced thyme (or 2 tablespoons minced fresh)
* 1/3rd cup all purpose flour
* 1/3rd cup soy sauce
* 2 bay leaves
* Vegetable oil

**Cooking:**

1. Heat a couple tablespoons of oil until shimmering in a big pan. Add the onions, and fry until onions soften and start getting lightly browned, 8 - 10 minutes medium heat. Stir in the flour and cook for another 1 minute. Slowly whisk in the chicken broth, smoothing out any lumps and scraping up any brown bits from the pan (those are the super flavorful bits!). Transfer to the slow cooker.

2. Add the beef broth, add to the slow cooker.

3. Combine the potatoes and carrots in a big bowl with a couple tablespoons of vegetable oil. Add salt and pepper and toss them around until it looks like they're all nicely mixed up. Place the resulting mixture in a large foil packet (e.g. place them on one side of a large piece of foil

4. Cook for ~10 hours on low.

5. Transfer the foil packet to a plate and leave everything alone for 5 minutes. Once the stew has settled, and leave for 5 minutes to heat through.

6. Eat

You can't really find a Ukrainian-style borscht recipe on the web

I've made this about 5 times, but most places should have it. You can cheat with the cabbage and just get the cabbage already cut for coleslaw (minus the carrot and onion).

I present to you: Ukrainian Borscht

1.	1 lb (500 g) extra-lean ground beef 
2.	2 onions
3.	4 cloves garlic
4.	1 carrot
5.	1 stalk celery
6.	1/2 cup (125 mL) chopped fresh dill 
7.	1/4 tsp (1 mL) caraway seeds
8.	1/4 tsp (1 mL) each salt and pepper 
9.	4 cups (1 L) thinly sliced cabbage 
10.	4 cups (1 L) beef stock 
11.	1 can (28 oz/796 mL) diced tomatoes 
12.	1/4 cup (50 mL) light sour cream 
13.	Dill sprigs


1 Combine the beef and all the chopped vegetables except the cabbage in your slow cooker. You're going to need a BIG oval one; if you have a smaller crock pot

2 Pour 2 cups of the beef broth over the vegetable/beef mix. If the vegetable/beef mix is not completely covered by the liquid

3 Cover and cook on the low heat setting for 8 and 1/2 hours. You can cheat and use high heat for 4 hours if you're in a hurry

* Black Beans
* Chiles Chipotles Adobos
* Onion
* Garlic
* Chicken Stock (or water)

* Black Pepper
* Italian Seasoning

Soak the black beans for about 8 to 12 hours as usual.  Drain and thoroughly rinse.

I like to smear some bacon grease on my crock pot before putting anything in it.  Olive or other oils will do.

Chop the onion and peel

Pull the chiles from the can.  Make sure to remove the cap and stem

Put all the ingredients in the crock and fill with chicken broth and/or water to just cover the beans.  Get all the sauce out of the can by swirling some of your water or stock in there.  You know you want it! My smaller crockpot is a Rival 5.5 qt oval one and it fits this recipe just perfectly.

Cook on high for 6 to 8 hours, possibly because my cooker gets it into a solid simmer by about half way through.  If you have any concerns, boil the beans for 10 minutes in a regular pot before putting them in your crock.

Serve in lots of different ways: sides to other Mexican fare, cheese, etc.  I like putting them in an omelette the next morning and topping it with cheese, sour cream and salsa.

* [Gumbo Base \(roux\) recipe](http://www.food.com/recipe/gumbo-base-aka-roux-47651)

I did a few things differently than what the recipe calls for. 

* I used boneless skinless chicken breasts.  I browned these after coating them in a seasoned flour before making my roux. 

* The roux was made in a LARGE cast iron skillet with the browned chicken goodness in the bottom still. I use a 1:1 (oil to flour) ratio for my roux and I've always made it with peanut oil. I usually end up adding a bit more flour than oil in the roux base depending on how it cooks. 

* **I follow the recipe up to step 6** and then throw the roux (browned flour/oil mixture and celery

* Once you've got enough broth in there that you can easily stir the roux around (think cake batter consistency or a little more ""wet"") add in your sliced up browned chicken and the smoked sausage pieces and let it slow cook for at least 4 hours on low. Season with Tony Chacherie's cajun seasoning. Most grocery stores carry it but you can also find it online.  I also add in cayenne pepper since we like our gumbo spicy.

* Every 45 minutes to an hour check on it. Ladle off any oil that comes to the top. Give it a good stir to make sure nothing is burning on the bottom and put the lid back on.  If it seems like it needs more liquid add in a little bit of chicken broth.

* I've used both a 5 qt round crockpot and a 7 qt oval crockpot. For the 7qt I usually double the recipe size. 

I've made this gumbo well over a dozen times now and it gets better every time I make it. Serve it with crusty French Bread

It is worth the time to make the roux. That typically takes me about 45 minutes to do a roux for a 7 qt. crockpot (1.5 cup of oil and about 2 cups of flour whisked in slowly). ",self,t5_2s64w,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/10znba/chicken_and_sausage_gumbo/

the 2 sections of ingredients were mixed separately then combined and cooked on high for 2 hours.  i'd say it came out perfectly texture wise except for the fact that around one part of the edge it burnt a bit.  i suppose i didn't grease the inside of the pot enough.  i think it's a little bland but next time i'll add nuts and maybe chocolate chips.

One big vertebrae and three smaller tail pieces. I deglazed the pan with beef broth, and into the pot. Next came Cholula's hot garlic sauce, Worcestershire sauce, about a teaspoon of thai fish sauce, black pepper, and some nutmeg (beef loves nutmeg). For veggies I chopped a big russet potato

Here is the recipe

Slow-Cooked German Short Ribs

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1 teaspoon salt

1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper

3 pounds beef short ribs

2 tablespoons olive oil

1 large onion

1/2 cup dry red wine

1/2 cup ~~chile sauce~~ tomato sauce

*1/4 cup Sriracha sauce

3 tablespoons packed brown sugar

3 tablespoons vinegar

1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce

*1 tablespoon honey

1/2 teaspoon dry mustard

~~1/2 teaspoon chili powder~~

2 tablespoons all-purpose flour

1/4 cup water


DIRECTIONS:

1. In a small bowl, and pepper. Coat the short ribs with the flour mixture. [I used a bag.]

2. In a large skillet

3. In a slow cooker, chili sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, mustard, and chili powder. Mix thoroughly. Transfer the short ribs from the skillet to the slow cooker.

4. Cover

5. Remove ribs, or until slightly thickened.

[Note: I plan on making this in my dutch oven at 325 for about 3 hours.]


[Edited for: After getting everything in the pot. An asterisk (*) denotes something I added to the original recipe]

Let me first say I did not know I was essentially making bar-b-q sauce. I had never made a homemade recipe for it and didn't realize that is what this was. That said

After browning 3.6 pounds of boneless short ribs and removing from pot

Edit 2: It turned out very well. I would have include pictures but the meat was pretty dark and there was no real way to take a shot that looked attractive (though it tasted awesome!) 

The red wine altered the taste of the sauce so that it wasn't really a bar-b-q sauce per se. The flavor was very good indeed. I don't think I will make short ribs again because they are so fatty though I will use this sauce on chicken and other lean meats. Thanks everyone for the suggestions and help!

    Ingredients:
    	2 pounds beef chuck (cut into ~1"" cubes)
    	0.25 cup flour
    	1.5 teaspoon salt
    	0.5 teaspoon pepper
    	1 teaspoon paprika

**You will need:**

A slow cooker with a good 6l capacity or a similarly big cast iron dutch oven. You could also get away with a big casserole and do it in the oven. 

A big heavy skillet. 

A plate

Tongs

**Ingredients:**

Oxtail. I usually make it with about 1kg worth

3 medium onions

3 large carrots

3 sticks celery

You can also add in half a turnip or a couple of parsnips for a bit of sweetness if that's your thing

A bottle of dark

1 pint of good quality dark beef stock. I make my own because beef bones are cheap. Use one you like but NO TOMATO. 

1tsp anchovy essence. Nam Pla will work just fine. 

2 bay leaves

A handful of whole black peppercorns

2 tsp dried sage

Flour

Sea salt to taste

**Directions**

First, then the meat, then your black peppercorns, sage and a bit of salt, and finally the rest of the veg. Tuck the bay leaves in there somewhere. Then pour in the bottle of beer, the anchovy essence and the stock. 

If you're using a slow cooker, bring to the boil, then reduce to a low simmer, put the lid on and leave for five hours, popping back now and then to give it all a poke and check nothing is sticking and burning. If it is, it's too hot. Long and low is the thing. You could also do this in a casserole in the oven, covered at 150C or so for five or six hours


You now have a big pot of unctuous goo. Note: this is not diet food. You can

Anyway, I like to leave it out overnight and reheat the next day for maximum flavour. 

-----------------------------------
**Chilli**

If you want to turn this into chilli, but it is delicious. 

**You'll need:**

A big pot. The dutch oven you used to make the stew in will do nicely. It's cast iron or bust here

The stew above

**Ingredients**

A large red onion

4 fat cloves of garlic

Rendered fat from smoked bacon. A tablespoon or so. Get the most heavily smoked (NOT SMOKED FLAVOURED) bacon you can - it's the flavour we want here. 

One large red bell pepper

Dried kidney beans

(*I have no idea if this statement is correct. I am as English as tea and crumpets so it's all a bit of a mystery. Beans are lovely though)


3tsp cumin seeds

2tsp coriander seeds

1/2 star anise

3 or 4 whole cloves

Toast the spices then grind them. 

Three whole dried chipotle chillies. Unless you can get Ñora or Guajillo. 

A couple of dried ancho chillies

Dried Cascabels or some other hot mexican chilli

Toast the above in a pan for a minute or so

1tsp of dried oregano.

1.5 tsp very finely ground espresso beans. 

2 tsp grated dark chocolate

1 can of crushed tomatoes. You could use two cans if you like it a bit more saucy and tomatoey.  

A shot of tequila

**Directions**

Okay
 
What you do now is sauté the onions in the bacon fat for a few minutes until they are slightly transparent and starting to turn gold. Add the garlic and continue for another couple of minutes. Add the spices and keep going until you can smell the flavours being released. Then add the chillies for another minute or two. Then the bell peppers. Few more minutes. Then the coffee and chocolate, then leave it to simmer for a couple of hours (the longer, again, the better), keeping an eye on the liquid. When it's all done, add a little salt if it seems necessary. 

Serve however you damn well please. A squeeze of lime and a bottle of cusqueña are always good.

1375487767.0,1jlj7y,Modified version of Dafina/Cholent: amazing,koryisma,45,10,15,"I'm sorry-- I didn't think to take a picture. 

Inspired by [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/slowcooking/comments/1j8oc0/cholent_the_original_slow_cooker_dish/)

I based my dafina off of [this recipe](http://therecipelesscook.blogspot.com/2011/03/skhina-aka-dafina-morroccan-sabbath.html), so I used a dutch oven at 250 degrees for 12 hours, but you can certainly do it in a large slow cooker-- just modify amounts so that they fit! This is incredibly flexible... 

My variation: 

1. Pour a thin coating of olive oil at the bottom of the cooker/dutch oven- enough to coat the bottom. 

2. Add two medium onions roughly chopped on top of the oil 

3. Add about a cup of soaked but uncooked Great Northern Beans

4. Add meat of choice: I used a large chicken breast cut in half

5. Add 3-4 whole peeled potatoes and/or sweet potatoes (I had white potatoes but wish I had sweet potatoes around: I could tell that the flavor would lend itself well!) 

4. Add 2-3 whole carrots cut in half or a handful of baby carrots 

5. Tuck 4-6 whole eggs in-shell around the pot/slow cooker (you see why I went with a dutch oven instead of a cooker-- it's a lot of food!) 

6. In a separate bowl, etc), a beaten egg, pinch of salt, pepper, nutmeg, cinnamon, and poke small holes in it with a knife or fork. Tuck this rice dumpling packet into the slow cooker or dutch oven.  You can make several of these if they fit

7. Fill the cooking vessel with broth (of whatever meat you are using) until everything is covered. Throw in some bones if you have them. Add liberal amounts of paprika, salt, pepper, coriander seed, and cumin. I'd say at least 1/2 tsp of each if not more. 

8. Cook on low heat for 10-12 hours. 

Serve! Take the eggs out first and let them cool a bit. Open the rice packet and empty onto plates. Traditionally, rice, eggs, and meat are served on the plate separately, but serve however you'd like. 

Even with the modifications

The chicken was flavorful and tender. The potatoes were an interesting texture because of the slow cooking and the fact that they were kept whole: soft on the outside and more like a baked potato on the inside. 

I made one rice dumpling and one packet of rice in the dafina-- I preferred the texture of the rice

The liquid reduced to a gravy with no problem

All in all, and the flavors were pretty awesome. I also really enjoyed reading about the history of the dish. It's a traditional Jewish sabbath food, where people would make the stew the night before, and let it sit in the oven or slow cooker overnight so that it would be ready for lunch the next day without having to cook and break the sabbath! One website I looked at said that Cholent was actually the recipe that slow cookers were originally designed for! 

Enjoy!

I've been looking high and low for an electric crock pot here in Switzerland but had no luck. Yesterday I made it to Pontarlier in France and look and behold they had one - yay!

Now I'm cooking my first roast and imagining what to do next. 

One of the reasons to get the crock pot was to make coking easier but here in Switzerland they just don't seem to have the crock pot nor the liners/bags.

 Original text for those who are interested

Ingredients:

* 1 cup butter or margarine
* 2 cups chopped onion
* 2 cups chopped celery
* 1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley  (**used about 1 tbsp of dried instead**)
* 12 ounces sliced mushrooms   (**left these out**)

* 1 teaspoon poultry seasoning
* 1 1/2 teaspoons dried sage

* 1 1/2 teaspoons salt
* 1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
* 4 1/2 cups chicken broth
* 2 eggs
 
	
Directions:  (I used a 5 quart slow cooker)

* Melt butter or margarine in a skillet over medium heat. Cook onion, and parsley in butter, stirring frequently.

* Spoon cooked vegetables over bread cubes in a very large mixing bowl. Season with poultry seasoning, marjoram, and salt and pepper. Pour in enough broth to moisten, and mix in eggs. Transfer mixture to slow cooker, and cover.

* Cook on High for 45 minutes, 3.5 hours on Low, then left it for 3 hours on Warm**)

1362116362.0,19g4rg,Sweet Juicy BBQ Pulled Pork in the Crock Pot,ryanhrap,40,9,16,"Here is a great recipe I have been making for years in the crock pot. It makes a great Pulled Pork that everyone will love.

**You will need:**

* -Bone in pork shoulder (I cook for 5 so usually I get one of the bigger ones at the supermarket)
* -12oz of your Favorite BBQ Sauce (I like using sweet baby rays)
* -1/4-1/2 cup of Orange Juice (This is the key to the recipe)
* - 1-1.5 oz Jack Daniels (or your favorite whiskey

First

In your Crock pot, and Jack Daniels. At first, you may think the mixture smells like Jack Daniels, but as it cooks, the alcohol cooks off and it gives a good smokiness.Then put your pork shoulder in and roll it around in the mixture to get it fully covered. This will not only mix your sauce up but it will also coat the pork. Once the pork is coated, place it bone side/skin side up. Then place your crock pot on Low for ~6 hours and enjoy the smell of it cooking. After ~6 Hours, I like to take the pork out and put it on a plate. At this time I will cut off any of the skin that is on the shoulder and cut the meat off of the bone. I just do this in big chunks and then place them back into the crock pot. You can throw the bone out at this time. Let it go for another hour or so on low. Then take the pork out and shred it on a plate. I feel that using your hands is good (sometimes hot!) or just two forks. If you are not able to cut the meat off of the bone at ~6 hours, you can put it in the crock pot for as long as you would like to. Sometimes I do an hour
I like to serve it on round or long rolls with some american Cheese.

Any left overs will freeze great for a quick easy meal later on.

* Chicken breast

* Onion

* Potato

* Carrot

* Celery

* Bean Sprouts

* Parsley

* Tomato

* Chicken Broth

* Vegetable Broth

* Spices

**The goods:**

* 1 lb. of ground beef

* 2 cans (15oz) chili or kidney beans; drained

* 1 can (15oz) chili beans with spicy sauce

* 1 can (28oz) diced tomatoes

* 1 can (6oz) tomato paste

* 1 small yellow onion

* 1 green pepper

* 2 jalapeno peppers (SEEDED!)

* 1 pack of beef bullion 

* 1/3 cup of bacon bits (or 3 strips of real bacon)

* 2 tablespoons chili powder

* 1 teaspoon garlic powder

* 10 shakes of dried oregano

* 1 teaspoon cumin

* 5 shakes dried basel

* 3/4 teaspoon salt

* 1/2 teaspoon black pepper

* 3/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper

* 1/2 teaspoon paprika

* 3/4 teaspoon sugar

* 15 shakes of worcestershire sauce 

* 3 loops around the slow cooker bowl with Sriracha (or your favorite hot sauce)

* 8 oz of your favorite beer (I use stouts as I think they are the best when cooking with beef)

* 1 cup creamy peanut butter




**Prep:**
Brown the beef.  While that is browning, don't drain it, add all of it to the mix(fat will add flavor and a bit of thickener).  Next I chop up the produce and add, then follow up with all the spices.  Then comes the 8 oz of beer(the rest of the beer makes its way to my belly). This is going to make the chili pretty liquidy, and if you are like me, I prefer my chili thick.  Now comes the peanut butter.  This adds a few things.  It acts as a thickener, it adds a lot of protein, 4-6 hours on low will do the job.  I turn off crock a half hour before serving.  I hope you enjoy it!
