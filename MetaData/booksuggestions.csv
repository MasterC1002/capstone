Bottom line of what I look in the book:

1) I want it to show me something, a possible future, a possible past, etc. Moralizing is *good*, even better if it's backed by an effective argument.

I think this is win-win for publishers. 

EDIT as of 5:58 PM EST- Thanks for the thoughtful responses. I totally understand that getting a ""free"" digital copy is essentially giving away a copy of the book. I get that that strategy in the short term seems like it is completely irrational for a company to do so. 

But here's the thing - if bookstores want to survive, like i said before, it's simply more convenient to hold your library online and in one device. Furthermore, more digital integration can allow authors to live update passages of their books instead of writing a forward to the book every so often. 

I still love books, they should throw in the digital version because it's simply more convenient. And does it really cost that much to convert a book into an epub/ebook format? I find it hard to believe that producing a digital format of a book costs something more than a few pennies given the type of technology we have today.

Sorry For the bad title

I'm a young reader (15 years-old) and I want to improve myself with reading. I would like to see things from other perspectives and I want to read quotes which help me to understand life better and sharp me and make me a better/ more intelligent Person. I hope you understand what I mean...  Books where you think
The book you suggest me, but not just one remarkable quote in the whole book and it would be also good if it's a book I can find at my local library. :) And for the genres, it shouldn't be any fantasy, Sci-Fi book. It should go more in the direction real life, but it's fine if there is an unrealistic adventure. I've heard Stephen King and Stephen Hawking have some good books, but I don't know their books really or what they are about, I just know King and Hawking are big names in the book scene (shame on me).

I know I have many receivables but I hope you can suggest a good one :)

I'm not going to read it for a while

The only examples I can think of right now aren't from books, where he slowly turns into an alien. Or one of the first sections of the game Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem, where you control a guy working for Charlemagne, and he gets infected, transforming as you go through the level into some sort of zombie thing. Or Shadow of the Colossus, where Wander slowly gets possessed, and gets paler over the course of the game.

I just like the idea of someone being on a mission, pushing past the limit of whatever this thing is, finishing their mission regardless. I'm sure there are tons of books about normal illnesses, but I'm not really interested in that. And I'm not that interested in zombies, either. I guess plague stories are okay, if they handle it in a clever way. I don't know if there's much left that fits, but I'd be glad to look into anything if there is.

Edit: I realize now that the desire for this type of book might stem from the book I'm reading now, addiction, transforming of the self through instruction or living conditions. That could be another way to go, I guess, but I'd prefer that the transformation be a negative thing.

I'm looking for Sci-Fi or Fantasy.  I've read all the Song of Ice and Fire books up to date - love them!  I've read a lot of Clancy (not all - dude's prolific), as I think I have it in hard copy).  If you recognize my username, you'll know that I love Anne McCaffrey's books.  I have read the ""Sword of Truth"" series, and while I liked some bits, the political message within and the author's tendency to beat a dead horse did nothing but piss me off.  I've read ""Snow Crash"" and thought it was fantastic, but I've had difficulty getting in to other Neil Stephenson books.  I've read a good deal of the Star Wars expanded universe books, but the ones I enjoyed most were the Rogue Squadron series.  I'd love to read a ""Witcher"" book (the games were awesome), of course

The main issue is that I feel completely lost in my life and hopeless about making any improvements. I think about suicide all the time.
I feel hopeless about my life
I am deeply depressed and my mind only serves to make me feel worse in every situation I put myself in. I am incredibly self-critical and bash myself and my character whenever I can. Tied in to this

I have terrible anxiety and tend to catastrphise situations. Despite the fact that I can socially perform very well in some situations and can seem like a very sociable person

My self-worth is nearly entirely built on what I think others think of me. 

I can not solve any problems in my life. I feel as if my problem-solving ""toolkit"" was removed from me some time ago and I have immense difficulty trying to complete the smallest tasks. I am very avoidant

This isn't a thing that fluctuates. When I'm not busy and not in the company of others

I just have this massive bunch of horrible insecurities that I spend all my mental energy on convincing myself that they are true. I have 0 self-esteem


This is kind of just an incomplete grocery list of things that keep my down and perpetuate my shitty mental life. I've been this way for 4-5 years.


Can anybody recommend books of any sort that could address some of these issues or offer me any guidance?


Alternatively

1373776869.0,1i9d30,"I just got a new beautiful kitty :) Any books out there that can help me raise her to be a playful, loving, cuddly cat? Or something on Feline psychology?",ODBC,34,14, but this cat fascinates me like nothing before. I have read books (and currently am reading one) about the psychological make-up of dogs; it goes without saying that I have also read guides made to teach about the different breeds of dogs' different characteristics and advice for their training.

So I have a need to buy books (PLURAL!!!) that revolve around these three topics:

* **Cat psychology. Their quirks. Literary works (like Poe's essay about cats' reasoning capabilities) that fascinate as well as stimulate the reader about feline life. [Melancholia's Dog](http://www.amazon.com/Melancholias-Dog-Reflections-Animal-Kinship/dp/0226465780) is a scholarly work examining the tie between depression and dogs in everything from Wittgenstein and Freud to Kafka and Homer.**

* **The *BEST*, but also what I can do to help her be comfortable enough to walk around with a leash (potentially; I would love this) or even just cuddle in bed when I read.**

* **In addition to a general training guidebook, for dogs it helps to squat low to their level when you want to see them) and also theory (e.g., dogs think you're less predatory when you squat down to their level).** 


So please reddit

edit: I am a moron. reddit = cats.

So my baby's name is Lady [the title] **Binx** ""The Sphinx"" Abby [for my beautiful black rescue great dane who passed away not too long ago] ""Ghost"" (GoT) *My Last Name* [no personal info].

1320052927.0,lv04a,Jorge Luis Borges,kurtgustavwilckens,21,2,6,"Hi Reddit!

I wanted to talk about this guy

He is an Argentinean writer and he recently got a Google Doodle for his 112th Birthday (he died already). He is mainly a short story writer

Let me share some details about Borges and recommend some of his stuff:

- He wrote a short story about an (almost) infinite library

- He wrote a short story about a guy that could not forget anything

- He published his 1st translation at the age of  9 (Wilde's ""The Happy Prince"") and translated (and transformed) most of the works of Poe, Kipling, Faulkner &amp; Whitman. He said (from Wiki) ""translation may improve upon the original, may even be unfaithful to it, and that alternative and potentially contradictory renderings of the same work can be equally valid.""

- Borges ""created"" one of the five ""actually existing"" copies of Abdul Alhazred's ""Necronomicon"" when he created an entry for it while he worked in the University of Buenos Aires (the Necronomicon is a fictional book mentioned in H.P. Lovecraft's works. Borges was a fan

- He was very critic of long works, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to go about it is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them.""

I just wanted to share with Reddit an author that may go unnoticed to the anglo speakers, and mystical to a point. For TL;DR haters, his longest work ever was 12 pages long, and people have called him the most important figure in Spanish literature since Cervantes.

I'm looking at the kinds of television shows he likes to watch for guidance.  For example he likes Castle

Other things that I think would be a turnoff given how he approaches movies and tv:

* Excessive violence
* Doesn't like historical settings
* Doesn't like futuristic settings
* Doesn't like excessive foul language
* No to magic, secret orders

1325891440.0,o61l9,I need a new Epic Fantasy series to read. What do you guys suggest?,zimmertr,21,3,40,"Last night I finished up reading the newest book in the Sword of Truth series and I’m looking to move onto another epic fantasy series. I’ve already read A Song of Ice and Fire and absolutely loved it. Well, I’m not sure how The Omen Machine got published, but couldn’t finish the last book. I just couldn’t  get into it. 

Basically

* Romance, etc. (I feel like love and lust in a novel or series really build character development and when books have this in it they really interest me.) 

* Length. (This isn't a must I guess, ya' know? )

* Politics

* Multiple Viewpoints (I know that many writing professors have always told us that there is one thing to never do when writing fiction: change viewpoints often. But this is something that I

* Impending doom (ASoIaF is another great place to draw examples for this bullet from. The threat of what is lurking behind the wall, etc. These make a story really interesting to me. ) 

* High Fantasy (Along with the aspect of romance, races, magic, swords and other weaponry, etc)  

* Adult (I don't really want to read Narnia or some other seemingly young audience novels. I would like it to be aimed towards an adult audience and have a more mature themes.) 

* Not Moral or overly religious (This is one thing that I didn't like about SoT. Richard was really annoyingly moral and was constantly making ridiculous decisions in order to preserve his integrity. Characters like The Hound and stuff from ASoIaF are amazing in the concept of non-prudent behavior.)

* **EDIT 1** I would also prefer the author to not be a misogynist. Terry Goodkind's portrayal of women was exceptionally annoying. They couldn't do anything unless a man helped them. lol

* **EDIT 2** Cinematography (While I understand that turning fantasy stories into movies or television shows is quite difficult and pushes budgets sky high, of course, we all know The Lord of the Rings movies are amazing even though Peter Jackson is a bit of a tool. lol)

I know these key points seem awfully demanding

Then I got older and got bored of those 2, other than that I didn't read much. I've read a few books here and there, or started some and didn't finish them.

So I just got a kindle and I'm excited to start reading again. But I'm so lost on what to read. I read just for entertainment so I don't care much about reading top notch stuff thats literary masterpieces but really boring to read. Personally

I've also read The Da Vinci Code and loved it. I read some of The Hitchhikers Guide. I read some of Twilight. I read God's Debris. Since getting the Kindle I've been reading A Song of Ice and Fire series

I've been recommended John Dies At The End and House of Leaves. In High School I read a bunch of books I didn't really like, The Scarlet Letter, Tale of Two Cities, and some book about an African chief or something. Though I did like Life of Pi.",,False,,1354174509.0,t3_13zflr
