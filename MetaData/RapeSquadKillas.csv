It wasn't possible at the time because of arranged guests but now seems like a good time to get this in place

***The Rules -***

**Woody -** When he comes up with a new topic or mentions his tech equipment. And when he mentions his Netflix sponsorship and/or any other advertising on PKA. Oh

**Kyle -** His showing of wealth and interest in younger girls and guns. Oh and when he mentions Wet Platinum or opposes competitor brands like KY or (Woody's Favorite) AstroGlide. 

**Jordie -** Jordie's love of Hitler (popular in old episodes) and lets throw in trucks too as well as when he says some absurd sexual term or reference. Add to that when he claims to be knowledgeable on a subject and tries to show facts.


**Lefty -** When he uses sophisticated vocabulary or goes on a small rant about politics or something of that nature

**Woody &amp; Kyle -** When those two mention Reddit one drink

We can add to this list over time of course

***Drink Requirements -***

**Jordie** *must* drink the same beverage as before

**Woody** can get off easy with his bitch drinks (I love ya

**Kyle and Lefty** are free to pick whatever they want

He mentioned that Kyle, which is true. Although lefty might not enjoy the love he gets. 

I think the reason why woody doesn't get as much love is the fact that he doesn't have moments in pka that compare to ""Im down cow"" or ""death to America."" Wings is outspoken and has a unique viewpoint on life. Kyle is very quick witted and has a great sense of humor. Lefty is similar in this manner

But let's not forget what woody brings to the table, which few people can claim to be.

I think the reason he doesn't get as much love in the subreddit is actually quite simple. Wings has a plethora of quotes to make easy references to, and the people that like him don't speak up, while the haters always do.

Anyway, then Lefty dropped the infamous quote; ""death to America.""  Woody started the topic in which wings chose to have sex with a cow, within seconds of woody asking the question.

*The facts are true but take some of he reporting with a pinch of salt


Here I'll give more in depth analysis of certain things that I deem worthy

**Jodi Arias**

Facts Listed Off:

* Mistrial: True
* Guilty: True
* Stabbed: 27 (or 29) not 19
* Shot: True
* Choked: Indeterminate
* California: Born and Raised. Murder was in Mesa Arizona
* Arias more overall coverage than Boston Bombings: [True](http://www.google.com/trends/explore?q=Boston+Bombings#q=Jodi%20Arias%2C%20Boston%20Bombing&amp;cmpt=q)

According to [The New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/25/us/mistrial-declared-in-penalty-phase-of-jodi-ariass-murder-trial.html) The facts are as follows:

* Jurors took 15 hours to find Arias **guilty**
* Jurors took 3 hours to deem her eligible for the death penalty
* Jurors could not decide the punishment 
* Judge had no option but to call **mistrial** in penalty phase of trial
* The guilty verdict will remain.

According to [The Associated Press](http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/steps-jodi-arias-case-19245931) the way forward involves:

* Finding new jurors.
* Taking death of the table and giving her life.

Prosecution isn't ready to take death off the table just yet.

""Maricopa County Attorney Bill Montgomery issued a statement Thursday saying: 'As of this point in time ... we will proceed with the intent to retry the penalty phase.'""

[Summary of the case](http://www.cnn.com/2013/05/04/us/jodi-arias-primer)

* Info Everyone Wants to know: [Debatable](http://www.foxnews.com/us/2013/05/22/man-fatally-shot-by-fbi-agent-in-florida/)
* Attacked agents with knife: [Maybe \(Leaning False

**Shady Game Dealings**

Firstly: 1 USD = 1.02 AUD

Not really shady but with regards to price points:

60 2006 USD = 69.2 2013 USD

[Recently it was predicted that there would be a base  price increase for Next Gen](http://metro.co.uk/2013/04/03/publishers-back-price-increase-for-next-gen-games-says-gamestop-3580829/)

**1 or 100?**

I was fucking up the math so I turned to the always helpful [WolframAlpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=binomial+distribution+n+%3D+4+p+%3D+0.5)
93.75% chance of 1 person winning.

* Then they hacked him to death.
* UK dials 999
* Talk about firearms and they will bring guns.

This guy is rich as fuck

known as FPS McDuck.

His face is not known

What would we do if shown?

Destroys public restrooms

Left behind are just toxic fumes.

Fucks bitches left and right

Shootin every enemy in sight.



(Refrain)

RapeSquasKillas!

We get into your house

we mug you and your spouse.

RapeSquadKillas!

we are ones to be feared

so rise up and get geared.



(Verse 2)

Watch out it's WingsOfRedemption

doesn't even need a mention.

though he lost a 1v1

Don't try talking 'bout it son

Stay away from his truck

Else he'll leave you in muck.

He'll throw dirt in your eyes

Shotgun shell to your thighs



(Refrain)



(Verse 3)

Newly acquired title of Grand Dragon

Stacked corpses in the KKK wagon.

This is the Head Nazi

It can only be Lefty.

His bottom half is a secret

But you know he ain't midget

Long words to which he is accustom

black men can begin to trust him.



(Refrain)



(Verse 4)

The one dealing the cards

the king of the fucknards.

For him ladies will whine

and that magnificent hairline.

When you look into his eye

You just know: ""Blame this guy!""

2 Minutes late how could he

let's just all unsub Woody...

------------------------
Written by NithingBlade &amp; and I thank MyNameIsSteal because he improved the song in some parts to make it flow better.

The reason why it's called RapeSquadKillas theme song is 
because the song is about them(the hosts)

Everyone is free to use it as long as my name is mentioned somewhere. 

My own take at it:

As you can see from the title, easier to find, and be more socially acceptable. After all, most of your parents probably think your going to turn into a serial killer when they see you browsing on Rape Squad Killas. 

This will hopefully ensure good timing so posts about PKA Episode 144 will stay on /r/RapeSquadKillas. Also it will give time to make adjustment to the new subreddit. 

Now, no one will be able to post links/text. The reason for this is so that us mods won't have to moderate two subreddits that focus on PKA. Don't worry, you will still be able to browse this subreddit like an archive. All the previous posts will stay so that we can look back 100 years from now and see the hilarious photoshops and memes you guys have created.

1. **Favela sign:**
when taking a dump your not in a state to worship god. the example of this is when the prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was in the bathroom and a friend of his said asallamalaikum (muslim greeting meaning may peace be upon you). He did not reply and afterwords told the person that the reason for this was that he was not in a state in which he could mention god. 
So the whole dealio with that is that your in a unclean state (when excreting) in the bathroom

2. **the left hand to greet:**
this is disrespectful for the reasons wings stated, sorry). 

3. **the Taxi's:**  
*No Alcohol*-muslims dont drink so this is self explainatory
*No Seeing eye animals* - its just dogs. Back in the day dogs where considered dirty in islam (and still kinda are) since they carried a lot of disease (still do in some middle eastern places and maybe other 3rd world countries). So they where almost like giant rats. 
but this isn't really an issue with domestic dogs and it seems the cabbies are just taking themselves too serious and being dickish imo.

1369961577.0,1fdhxi,Help wings; a marketers perspective,stuartiscool,142,48,52,"So I've been subscribed to Wings for a little over two years now and I feel that I may be in a position to offer advice. I’m 22 and doing my masters degree in marketing management at a top UK university. I know I’m young but I have worked in a number of high profile organisations ranging from private healthcare to household brands. I specialize in strategic marketing decisions and look to be a consultant in this area upon graduation.  I want to make it clear that I’m not hating on wings here.  This is criticism intended to help him.

I dont know if he reads this subreddit but if it gets his attention somehow it would be great.

Here are some fundamental principles that he needs to apply to his videos.

RULE 1; KEEP IT POSITIVE. He complains too much. We all know this and we say it in the comments. Wings knows this too, do not complain.

RULE 2; DO NOT UPLOAD TWO VIDEOS PER DAY. I know why he is doing this, he offers two less than average videos. He needs to focus on quality over quantity. The results will not be immediate growth, but views will steadily grow over time as people recognise the enhanced quality.

RULE 3: WRITE OUT COMMENTARIES AND EDIT. A big factor that I notice about Wings is that he rambles. Topics begin with discussion of cops and end with discussions about what he's eating for lunch that week. He needs to write down what he intends to say and stick to it. He doesnt have to read it as a script but make sure there's a clear structure in place.  Topics are central to a good commentary and therefore cannot be second rate. 

RULE 4: GET BETTER AT EDITING. You know the biggest difference between the content on youtube 4 years ago and the content we see today? Its the video quality. Today’s videos are smooth and video quality is high. Wings' video quality is very high but how many times have you seen the video cut out mid sentence or start without a proper intro? His league play video today didn’t even show the ending. This is quality below some people that have less than 1

RULE 5; PROVIDE LINKS TO OTHER VIDEOS AT THE END. This is something practically all other commentators are doing. People dont just watch one video

RULE 6; CONSISTENCY keep the content consistent. You want to do a series on guns

FOR COD GAMEPLAYS
RULE 7; DON'T PLAY IN TEAMS.  I dont care about your KD, but please no more playing with a team and sitting at the back of the map. I dont care about your KD i care about being entertained.

These are the basic rules for improving his videos. Now for what direction the channel should go in.

My opinion is that he should get a new audience. The views for gaming have plummeted and are not going to recover with the current audience. The gaming community has come and gone and unfortunately written him off from poor content

Change the focus onto truck talk. Create a new channel that is focused on cars and really go for it. This will put him in a new category on youtube with a new audience

Ditch 'wingsofredemption' and stick with Jordie. Re-brand yourself.

You know how he was saying about how he couldnt get a truck to review on a regular basis? Do a few good and thorough reviews that show the positives of some trucks from a local dealer and i bet people will be lining round the block for you to show off their cars and promote their local dealerships. I seem to remember FPS Russia overloading a guys website in return for access to guns. It works

In fact many young kids are buying their first cars at 16

Furthermore

The most important thing now is to make change happen. If you dont do anything different

EDIT: Wow thanks to whoever bought me reddit gold! I think its great that so many people in the comments are such loyal supporters of wings.  The overwhelming messages from you all is very clear that we all want the best for him.

If someone walks in your room now and sees that you are on a page called ""Rape Squad Killas"" what are they going to think?

Us mods have been discussing and thinking and we have come to the conclusion of migrating to /r/painkilleralready

We wanted to ask the community here what their opionion is. The Rape Squad Killas was a one off joke and /r/painkilleralready would be better since it is a lot more relevant to the show and more socially acceptable.

[I'm also linking to a poll that I would like you guys to fill out. Just a simple yes or no on moving subs.](http://poll.pollcode.com/px87p)

The look and feel of the sub would be even better since /u/FrictionPistol has been added as a mod to the new sub and has been busting his ass on making the sub look great.

The only negatives to this decision is that we have just earned 5k subs here and we would have to start again

We found Woody's Twitch and low-and-behold [Episode 20](http://www.twitch.tv/woodysgamertag/b/269393978) was 8 hours long. I took the liberty of listening to it to find out if it was true however 2 hours in they all go off to play MW2 and the next 6 hours is just nothing

Woody has told us multiple times that [Episode 100](http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=painkiller+already+100&amp;oq=painkiller+already+100&amp;gs_l=youtube.3..35i39j0.862112.866558.0.866778.11.11.0.0.0.0.150.911.10j1.11.0...0.0...1ac.1.11.youtube.jkQ74THZ1_w) was an 8-hour show in total but on his Channel it's only [1:37:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SxMhGwvT-3E) and [4:24:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3OvGEYQGyE) on Jordie's. What's odd is that at the end of Jordie's show, 4:24:00](http://youtu.be/c3OvGEYQGyE?t=4h24m) for verification.

I went and scanned through the entire [PKA Playlist](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCGzsMd4ChI) and the longest Episodes available to us are Episodes [85](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ecmvhpgpZE), all spanning over 5 hours long. I'm not exactly sure why Woody thinks he's done an 8 hour Show but aside from 100, which went to shit and is only half that we've not even been close to 8 hours in one week.

**TL;DR -** 

* **Episode 20 is not 8 hours long

* **Episode 100 might have been over 8 hours but Jordie ends his Show at 4 so we've no idea.**

* **The longest Episodes available to us currently are (in order) 85

Thanks for reading that wall of text. This took over 6 hours of non-stop listening to Shows to investigate this myth and multiple re-reads and edits. I don't want it to go unnoticed. Just doing my duty as a PKA fan. FPSKyle,,False,self,t5_2ub3n,1372089831.0,,True

~~Lefty asked (I hope it was the real him!) if I could post a full AMA in the original post (http://en.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1htx25/ama_request_rockon1m1/). So here it is!~~

**I had not idea that Lefty had not reddit
  
For those of you curious of how the audio of PKA 140 was synced I have posted a ""speed editing"" video as a tribute to PKA (http://goo.gl/9Hiif). It was pretty weird watching their mouths move for 6+ hours ROFL.

---------------------------------------------------  
    
  
  
As background
  
**Original Questions by  /u/kingjames101**
  
*1 How much has PKA benefited you?*  
*2 Do you think it was worth the cost of advertising?*  
*3 How do you like being a meme within the PKA community?*  
  
**My Original Response**
  
First of all
  
**1.**  
*A.* A lot. 

*B.* I went from being unknown to being slightly more recognized. Even in random videos (like Amazingfilms247). As a result
  
*C.* I use YouTube as a scapegoat. I love making entertaining content and my happiness is directly correlated to the comments and reactions you guys give me. **When I am having a tough day in the office and I see that blue light shine on my Samsung Galaxy (indicating there is inbox)
  
*D.* Not only this but the influx of positive support and kind comments just motivates me to keep improving my videos. Seriously
  

**2.**
This is a very subjective question. It was to me. I worked/saved up the money and rationalized the cons/pros. I'm almost 26
  

**3.**
I love it almost as much as I love the way my channel smells! I honestly love it
  
**I have even started a ""challenge"" in Twitter #RockOn1m1Giveaway for the best meme!** Feel free to submit yours! So if you think you are up to the challenge
  
**Here are some of your contenders should you think in participating:**

Now I’m sure that Wings stretches the truth with money, the Internet would be the last thing to go, because YouTube his only form of income, but like I previously said, there is a chance where Wings may no longer be able to be a part of the podcast.  IMHO Wings used to be a big part of the show, but lately he’s been a drain on it. It’s no longer as fun to watch because Wings will complain about YouTube/Money/Cops/His weight at the drop of a hat, and sometimes interrupts a topic to do so. So his departure from the show wouldn't affect me too much, I wouldn't mind a new host at all. 

Opinions? Sorry for the wall of text.

He is also saying he wants to use that as an excuse to file for disability(I disagree with that). As someone who has had serious nerve damage to my lower back from a football injury...I know his injury is not as irreparable as he makes it out to be. There are many different procedures that can be done based on the extent of damage that can drastically improve his quality of life. A couple of examples of things he can look into are surgeries that can remove pressure from the nerve and they can even graft a nerve in place of the damaged one(s). There are many other options. The two I listed are the ones I have had done personally. Just because nerves cannot be regenerated doesn't mean there aren't any ""workarounds"". It took me several different doctors to find one willing to help...He may need to shop around outside of SC. 

Wings has the typically mindset of many morbidly obese people...they latch on to something they see as a crippling disability that will stop them from ever loosing any weight. They feel as if their situation is unique and no one else can understand. 

He needs to realize that he has a whole lot more resources at his disposal than the average person. He is actually ahead of the game in that respect. He just has to make the decision to do whatever it takes. Heck

I hope Woody or someone else he knows personally can get this information to him. ",self,t5_2ub3n,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1g1nm3/wings_needs_to_know_that_nerve_damage_in_his_knee/

* He talked a **lot**. This isn't a problem when you are a guest

* He did not stay on topic. It felt like he wanted to talk to Wings about weight and nothing else and changed back to that topic multiple times. I would say at least half of the show seemed to be Boogie talking to Wings. I did enjoy this PKA and even enjoyed the Boogie/Wings conversation but I don't want to hear it every week. 

* It seemed like anything that was a bit on the edge that anyone said (usually Wings), I feel like he would try to censor some of it. 

* This is similar to the above point but I just can't imagine Boogie responding to some of the PKA questions very well. I can't see him explaining how he would go about murdering someone and getting away with it or what crime he would commit if he could get away with anything. He would always take the easy way out of answering.

* Too many hosts. My favourite PKAs tend to be Woody, I bet people would've been saying we hardly heard from Lefty either, Boogie just took over and made it the Wings and Boogie show.

This is my idea though, there is no way for the other 3 to have any input.",,False,self,t5_2ub3n,False,,

Borderlands 2- Woody loves this game. The game is meant to be played with 4 people all using a different type of character. I would watch this the whole way through.

Payday 2- This game is just funny to watch people play. I can imagine it would result in constant chanting of ""RAPE SQUAD KILLAS!"" As Kyle robs a bank. There was a post earlier explaining this.

Those are just two games I know would do great.

Now how can this happen? I think Kyle would want his gaming channel ready before any of this is considered. But I could see them just playing together and uploading each part to their individual channels. But maybe if these get really popular then there could be a whole channel dedicated to PKA lets plays?  This is looking ahead of course.

The point of this post is to get Woody to finally act on this. People have wanted PKA Let's Plays for awhile and I want to see it happen. There would be so many great and memorable moments that happen along the way.

Until then, I ask redditors to please refrain from making guest threads. For example, ""I want Phillip DeFranco as a guest"" Don't worry, I'm sure the PKA gang has seen your requests.

Lastly, redditors can link each other to videos that the Woody and the gang watched in the episode. For example, the crazy World Star Hip Hop Vids. 

Not only will this thread organize the subreddit but it'll be a central interactive thread where we can laugh together.

Until then

To make my stress worse i had tourettes which made me constantly Grunt and roll my eyes so i was looking as far up as possible and only a small part of my pupil could be seen, i knew everyone was watching and judging and i was always very awkward. also another side of my tourettes was that i got extremely ""Obsessed"" with many things i did, such as certain games and shows for example to the point at which it would get withdrawal symptoms if i did not do the activity. 

And i did get bullied and taunted for it

No one wanted to be associated with me.

it was horrible.

fast forward a few years and have done my GCSE's and i felt i did terribly. After doing them i felt horrible as if my life was over. As we finished early in June that year due to the exams ending around that time

This was the year 2011, i hated everything, i lost contact with my friends due to mostly me never leaving my room, my dog and bet friend had died in May earlier that year so i was already down due to that. my parents grew ever more worried about me and took me to the doctors where i was diagnosed with depression.

For those who have never had depression or any form of deep ""Sadness"" it is horrific, with no hope or future.

Suicide went through my head
 
Then Woody uploaded this video;

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMgDSboZ6Ww&amp;list=FLHM16vGJ6Yt6R78-8R0TbQw

Woody and Tourettes syndrome.

I found out he had it similar to me, awsome kids and wife. but how i thought to myself, he had this shameful neurological disease.

i began watching more and more of his videos, PKA, i watched every single episode, these 3 (Soon to be 4) hilarious guys and a brilliant guest every week talking about games and funny news stories made my week exiting, they made me feel as if i had something to look forward to every week. it was amazing.
 
Although it sounded pathetic

After a few weeks of watching PKA my parents noticed a change in me. i was still miserable but i now had more vigor in my speech.

The day my results came in i was relieved

But it was better, i had Woody and the PKA crew.

My depression situation got gradually better over the next few months and i made sure to watch every video Woody posted

Woody made me happy, and he had a good life. :)

The only thing i find sad is that i think he will never hear my story

So Woody
know you are a good man.


Joe.

Russia (Dmetri) was born in Russia in a small town that became war ridden after WWII. His father was a industrial worker for most of his life until he was forced to fight in the war. He fought for 5 long years and worked his way up the ranks.   He was known for his brutal assassinations of his enemies that made regular men shudder in fear. By this time Russia was only 12 and the military was loosing the war. So the military decided to start making kids fight.  Russia's dad heard of this and refused to make his son fight in this brutal war. No 12 year old should see the things he saw. Surely that would ruin a child. He went to his commanding officer and begged but to no avail.  So with no other choice they fled to America. 

Russia's dad contacted the us military and offered to exchange secrets for protection. The us agreed and gave them all fake identities as farmers in Georgia. They made them learn to speak with a perfect English accent and eventually down the road they realized how valuable of an asset Russia's father would be and welcomed him and the CIA's newest agent further protecting their identities.   

Long since has the war passed so Russia decided to come out of hiding. With his CIA connections he got access to all sorts of weapons and artillery. Plus what's cooler? Seeing a bad ass American blow shit up or a crazy Russian blow shit up?   It was a smart business move.  

But out of fear Russia still hides his identity as Kyle the best he can in case the Russian military ever decide to come after him he can change his appearance and pretend to be the American born and raised farm boy from Georgia.

I tweet Woody my skype. about 15 minutes later, and make sure I could put on the best performance I could. No reply. I figured he was at Joe's house. I didn't want to interrupt his training, so if he didn't reply, I was fine. I'm no crazy fanboy, I like to carry myself in the most professional way possible on my channel. 

A week goes by and still no response. He's back home by now. I sent him one more message

I have this horrible feeling in my stomach I'm being played by some internet troll lol. I believe if Woody was busy, you guys can look at all that HTML stuff and see if it was the real woody, or some guy linking to his channel somehow with a fake account.

Yes. After sufficient lubrication was applied

*Does it get sticky when rubbed between fingers?*
No. I believe this is attributed to the silicone base

*Is the cleanup easy?*
Yes

So.  Here is my detailed theory.  It may seem long but I think it's well worth the read. 

Wings has been on YouTube for close to what 5 years?  In that 5 years he has opened himself up to his viewers and let you know who he is.  They have seen his ups and downs most of his personality traits (especially if you follow him on twitter) and really gotten to know who the guy 


Now lets say you had a friend that you had known for 5 years.  When they are depressed (even though they may not say it aloud) you would know wouldn't you?   You would.  Or at least I do with my friends.  As someone who goes to YouTube for a laugh or some motivation or a pick me up I do not personally enjoy listening to someone talk when I can tell they are upset and do not want to be doing what they are doing.  You can just hear it In his voice and its kind of contagious.  

An example is music.  We all have those songs that for some reason just pick us up and some that just make us want to sit and dwell on our lives.  

It's the same with someone you watch on YouTube that you have any kind of admiration for.  Wings may think the majority if his viewers are children but there are a lot of people on YouTube that are adults.  Such as myself.  I'm 23 working full time and going to college. I don't have a mommy or daddy to help me nor do I have grants or scholarships. So I know how wings feel when he says he is hurting for money.  Trust me wings a lot of people go there.   But when I go to YouTube It's my escape. The same as it is for a lot of people and we don't want to listen to someone who is constantly depressed no matter how well you try to mask it we can just tell.  It at least some of us.   

We get it. You're over call of duty and YouTube.  You don't know what to do.   Hmmm maybe listen to your subs??  We may not be your ""customers"" but we are the reason you do or don't make money so why not give us what we want to an extent?   You don't like doing vlogs

You complaining as much as you do about your channel dying isn't helping you.  You can only get pity pussy for so long before you have to man up and do something about it to get that pussy. 

You don't need to release 3-5 videos a day for views.  What you need to do is pull yourself out of this hole you're in stop worrying so much about money (it's hard I know) and make 1-2 good videos a day.  

You wonder why you're doing worse now than before?  It's because people can tell you are depressed just by the way you speak and YouTube like I said is an escape for most people. Not a place to go and feel worse. 

Anyways I know he won't ever read this but I just wanted to share my thoughts.

First off

So

http://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-one/pre-order-xbox-one/disclaimer

As you can see in the link I just posted, South America etc. will be able to play Xbox One. Here is a tweet that confirms this fact:

https://twitter.com/XboxSupport1/statuses/344879674335305728

Also, but the 360 had a very similar history. The console was launched in 2005 and to this day it only has a handful of countries on its official list. I live in Romania (Eastern Europe) and to play on Xbox Live I had to make a UK account because my country wasn't on that list. But this trick will probably not work on Xbox One (check the tweet above).

So, I hope you don't take this as hate, because this was really not my intention.

A while a go I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/RapeSquadKillas/comments/1ffo9h/episode_search_idea_for_this_subreddit/)



**Below is a brief explanation of some decisions I made while making the table:**

* I chose not to include Lefty in the guests column as he is now considered a host. I did however
* I used a '-' to indicate that there were no significant guests featured in the episode.
* The grayed out part of the table at the bottom are episodes that have not yet happened. I simply put them there so that they can be easily filled in the following weeks.
* Commas have been used to separate guests and key events.



**A few notes if you would like to help complete this search:**

* Anybody with the link may edit the doc. Please be responsible and only add necessary information.
* Proof read the cells that have been filled and correct any mistakes. I filled a large amount of the guest column by listening to people's voices in the show
* When adding guests that have appeared in multiple episodes
* Fill in gaps. i.e if you think there is a notable event missing
* Please remember that this is meant to be a simple search. Only add notable events


Thankyou for any help in advance.

I sort of faked not understanding the context and assigned him a kink of being into trans people.

This week a subscriber wrote me and said it was an offensive term and his brother was trans. He said it was about the same use using the word ""nigger"".  I didn't want that so we're making the switch.

We all know Kyles big secret
Picture this- Woody sets up a wide desk like the ones on Late night talk shows
This could be a pricy event
And just do a normal show with high production value.
More ideas:
-Lineup Sub calls in advance. Guys who can talk and have decent audio equipment.
-hope comes on briefly (mayb.) No pervy motivations! just from the vids woody puts up and the praise he gives she seems like a very vibrant person who might have some witty insight to add to the conversation.

Woody - Camping equipment aswell as some fishing equipments and a tomahawk.

Wings - Magically finds a Car, a Mosin Nagant with the bayonett, and a not working TV (Since ""something"" happend with that TV)

Lefty - Change of clothes (Nazi clothes though) A luger pistol that he found when he digged up his Nazi Veteran Grand dad and a stove.

If you have VLC Media Player, click Media at the top, and then Open Network Streak. Alternatively, press Control + N when in VLC. Then, go to Youtube and copy the URL of the PKA you want to download, and then paste it where it says ""Please enter a network URL."" It may take a little bit to load. Once you can view it, you can turn up the volume to 200% in the bottom right corner which allows you to be able to hear everyone.
