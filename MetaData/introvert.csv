  Half of you that post here aren't introverts. I see way too many posts from people who basically say ""I'm so introverted because.."", or even family relationships is nothing to celebrate. It's not healthy, and its not indicative of somebody who is introverted.    


Do you want to know what does make you an introvert?    

* The tendency to think introspectively rather than go to someone else with your problems.

* The need to recharge after social situations.  


That's about it in a very generalized nut shell. You're not an introvert if you don't have friends. You cannot classify yourself as an introvert simply because you play video games and watch movies. And if you intentionally neglect relationships, all found on the side bar.


Downvote it, and get your facts straight.

1355716683.0,14z559,15 PROTIPs for Introverts,0hypothesis,629,59,81,"A number of posts on here have posed questions on how to deal with life as an introvert. I'm 41

Feel free to ask me questions if you wish. And please, or share more tips. I'd love to collect more of them.

1. **Understand that introversion is just caused by brain chemistry**: The short version is that introverts are sensitive to dopamine. When we get too much, as well as the ability to sustain a calm, alert feeling. Extroverts, in comparison, have a low sensitivity to dopamine, and in fact, don't get enough of it unless they get help from the adrenaline system. They need excitement to feel good.

2. **Understand how extroverts and introverts are different**: Extroverts primarily use the adrenaline pathway of the brain, a relay station called the posterior thalamus, the emotional center, and the motor area and sensory processing center. All of this, you'll note, is more about action, movement, the primary introvert pathway has **seven** parts to it, the long-term memory center

3. **Recharge like an introvert**: Introverts need quiet to recharge and consolidate events they've experienced. Even though extroverts relax by being in stimulating environments and often suggest you do the same

4. **Know what introversion isn't**: Introversion is NOT equivalent to shyness, or even performing on stage. Any of these things might apply to you, but they are separate from your introversion, even if they could be somewhat related. For example, you may not like parties because you don't like the crowds and loud music, even if you enjoy meeting new people and have no shyness whatsoever.

5. **Dump the negativity**: Look up introvert in Google, and typically self-centered person."" It's garbage, and its the same in most dictionaries. These definitions have unnecessary negative baggage. I suggest losing that negative meaning, and just understand that it really means simply that you have a different brain chemistry.

6. **Do the required reading**: Read [The Introvert Advantage] (http://www.amazon.com/Introvert-Advantage-Thrive-Extrovert-World/dp/0761123695/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1355713299&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=the+introvert+advantage) by Marti Olsen Laney. It is a wonderful book and explains in detail what it means to be an introvert. The brain chemistry explanations from the earlier points came from that book, and information in it as well.
 
7. **Schedule downtime**: Build downtime into your schedule. Block out days where you plan to do...nothing. If you want to spend a quiet day in bed where you don't even take off your pajamas, not less. If you are still young it's important to let your family know that you just need downtime if they pressure you to try to recharge like an extrovert.

8. **Noise-canceling headphones are your friend**: There's almost no easier way to get some instant quiet time than using them. 

9. **Exercise**: This is good advise for anyone but this is helpful for introverts because it will give you more energy to work with since it takes more of it for us to be around stimulation.

10. **Party Tip #1: Get out of the action**: Extroverts often like constant stimulation and stay in the middle of the action the entire time. If you take ""quiet"" breaks you'll have an easier time. 

11. **Party Tip #2: Schedule your goodbyes**: You can make it easy to marshal your energy for even very loud and overwhelming parties if you know what time you're going to leave. You might even enjoy the craziness for a while since you know it's for a limited time. Tell your friends that you have to go by a certain time

12. **Party tip #3: Have a role**: If you have a role to focus on

13. **Party tip #4: Find quiet spaces**: Know where the getaways are if you've got a longer event. Lobbies or quieter rooms can give you a break. 

14. **Party tip #5: Wind down afterwards**: Some people can party 'till they drop but usually introverts need some time immediately after events to chill out. Make that wind down time part of your party plan. I usually plan on an hour or more of quiet at home after an event.

15. **Party tip #6: You don't owe anyone an explanation**: If you get overwhelmed, I usually just say something general like ""I have something I have to take care of"", then I focus the conversation on a very friendly goodbye, telling them that I had a good time, and that I'm looking forward to seeing them again.",,False,t5_2qlr2,True

I come to you

For starters I am 19, in fact I feel more intelligent than a majority of the people here.. but I'm not smarter than them. I'm that kid from the TIL's that was always told how smart I am, and I never tried in school and got progressively lower grades (from straight A's to C's to F's). I don't apply myself. I just sit in my room playing video games with friends feeling like it's too late and I've fucked my life up. This is my 3rd semester and I haven't pulled my shit together. 

I don't want to hear college may not be for me, everyday. I'm scared and don't know what to do.

I went to school with him so I saw firsthand some of the abuse he received from other students for being who he was.  It was these people that first made him take a step back from interacting with others and it carried on with him into his adult life.  A girl in our science class Freshman year who the teacher had seated next to him said:  ""I don't know him and I don't want to get to know him"" to the class aloud which made everyone laugh.  This of course resulted in him getting teased by the rest of the popular kids in the class the rest of the year while the teacher barely did anything about it.  

For the rest of his high school career others made fun of him for how he looked, our principal had asked everyone to politely wait for applause until after diploma acceptance was over but everyone in the auditorium clapped for everyone anyway.  Except for my friend.  

He had worked a few dead end jobs here and there there.  The co workers treatment towards him wasn't really any different.  The classic question all of us introverts hate ""Why are you so quiet""?  He was even asked this after trying his best to socialize with everyone at work

From what he was telling me over the past couple of months all of his trouble with his jobs was seriously troubling him and his latest job was working with mostly girls who had attitudes was distressing him greatly so he chose to quit out of frustration.  He had some trouble finding another job.  Went in for interviews and no one would hire him despite his fantastic work ethic.  

Today I got a call from his younger brother that he had ended his own life today and out of respect for his family I would rather now say how...  

My point in sharing his story with you guys because this might sound like you and I just want to say that no matter how people have wrong you in life and you might feel like they made you who you are please let it go!  Live your life with love and indeed keep those close around you because its true most people don't give a fuck about other people. 

Thank you for reading.  Please pray for his family and friends.  

Love

I can go about my day with little or no socializing and not feel bothered by the fact, etc. On the other hand, treating all classified 'extroverts' as sharing the same cookie-cutter view on socializing is far from true. Most people straddle somewhere in the middle of the scale, I'd imagine.

On a final, but some, who have become convinced that introversion is something that makes them unique and better. It doesn't, claiming such ideas as 'extroverts don't experience the richness of the world as deeply as introverts do' or treating them rudely because they themselves aren't introverts and don't understand us is not going to help us bridge the idea that introverts and extroverts aren't different species who are inherently divided.

I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to all you people here. This subreddit and the various books I've recently read on introversion has really helped me clear out a load of rubbish from my mind.

1). Be cautious when choosing your friends. 
-This is what innies do best

2). Happiness is overrated. 
-Don't believe those who say that not being happy all of the time is a mental disorder. We should at the very most be content most of the time

3).Don't believe the media 
-(no brainer

4). I
-parents have raised my generation to think very highly of themselves

5). Question everything.
-This I cannot stress enough. Know that there is no such thing as right or wrong, laws, theories, your senses, etc. Use your brain, often. 

6). Comparing yourself with people who have more than you benefits nobody. 
-instead

7). Beauty means nothing unless you plan on whoring yourself out in the real world. 

8). Our species does not benefit from sunbathing.
-Ever wonder why our natural hair color is always darker than our skin? It's a protective adaptation

9). People under estimate the power of the human body.
-we can heal ourselves, a brain that releases adrenaline to help us out in tough situations, antibodies in breast milk that get absorbed by babies when breast feeding, and the list keeps going. Yet some people are brainwashed into associating fat with beauty, replacing breast milk with formula as if it were a viable alternative, and preventing children from playing outdoors because it is ""dangerous."" What is dangerous is keeping the kids indoors, preventing them from developing the antibodies that would allow them to fight off the more dangerous strains of bacteria that evolve through time

11). Only believe what you have researched yourself.
-a friend once told me that our fingerprints were an adaptive trait used for grasping. I looked it up, unless you don't mind being made a fool of. 

12). Life is interesting.
-Everything about it (the people, temperature, cultures, sun sets, the universe) is constantly changing. It's amazing how much there is to learn, explore and understand about it. 

That's some of the stuff I've learned as an innie. Anyone else have epiphanies of their own?

My best friend from high school is getting married. We went to different colleges and grew apart after high school (we are now 27). At the same time we grew up quite differently. 

I became a geek, etc. I have lived with the same guy since I was 19 and we are best friends as well as legal spouses. We do geeky things together like play board games and MMOs as a pair. I am an engineer and the people I hang out with the most are either other engineers (men) or women that play on my sports team (manly women, relatively speaking). I struggled quite a bit at my college since it was a very Greek social atmosphere and I simply did not fit in. I was also cut off from my parents so didn't have the money to party and join a sorority. That's what drew me to online games, as much of my friends at the time were in-game (and many are still friends of mine).

She became more of a social butterfly. She was popular and does girly things like decorating

She ended up moving to the city where I already lived and we hang out from time to time

I was a little hurt but not surprised when I was not asked to be a bridesmaid. I knew she had lots of new friends and I was cool with it. It's not really my type of thing anyway.

She asked me to come to her wedding shower

I despise clubs and dancing, maybe have a drink or two, then head home before it got too crazy.

I left work early to get ready. I put on club appropriate clothing (not hard as I only have one shirt that isn't either work clothes or a t-shirt), and left. I stopped and got her a gift card for her favorite clothing store, a relatively upscale trendy place.

I drove 45 minutes to the meetup location and knocked on the door. No answer. I walked back to my car and checked the invitation, right time.

I was a little early and started to wonder if they went out to get some supplies or something

Turns out they decided to move the time. They already had their food for dinner

I was so hurt that no one bothered to tell me the time moved

The whole experience left me so depressed and hurt. I feel like I was only invited to be nice

Sorry for the length

I'm a 20yo female university student living at home. 

I hate parties, my best friends being my boyfriend of 2 years and my dogs and cats. 

I find enjoyment in reading, cross stitch, sewing, watching TV and sometimes gaming. 

People find this very difficult to comprehend. I am frequently asked ""oh are you off out with your mates to the students union bar?"" and when I say no people look at me like I'm mad. I say I hate partying out all weekend and would much rather curl up in front of the TV with a nice cup of tea

At first I thought there was something wrong with me. I had suffered from social anxiety for years but I thought it was just that - I wasn't enjoying social events etc because I had a mental illness. But

This worried me; maybe I was desensitized due to my social phobia and I'd never be normal. I'd never feel up to going out for a few drinks with colleagues after work or partying into the early hours of the morning like someone my age and status *should* be doing. And it really bothered me for a while; actually it was embarrassing. 

My family have always been very intrusive and in-your-face. They think that if I'm particularly quiet or I want to just spend the day in my room - perfectly content - that my depression is relapsing and have sat for hours prodding me to open up and talk. When I refuse to

First of all, as well as concrete tips.

And now

* Introversion is not the same as shyness. It is

* Introverts tend to take longer to adjust to new social environments. But once they dive in

* The people who are the most outspoken are often considered to be the best contributors, and then give well-thought-out responses and ideas that can be the best quality. This is often antithetical to what people think about these situations.

* The animal kingdom shows the same extroverted and introverted traits as humans. Even fruit flies. Both are necessary for the group's survival, but the ""extroverted"" fish were caught (and if it had been a predator, it would have been eaten). But then, after using other means to catch both kinds of fish in the population, the extroverted fish adjusted better to the entirely new situation and found ways to get food, mate, and reproduce in the lab environment.

* Introverts and extroverts do better in environments more suited to their natures. In one experiment

* While introverts and extroverts both are generally of the same intelligence level, and when introverts are tested, they tend to learn more facts, and have more information than extroverts because of this. She quoted a great Einstein saying: ""It's not that I'm so smart, it's just that I stay with problems longer.""

* When studies explored the highest performers in the world--whether in sports, which is a focused kind of practice. This kind of practice is almost always a solitary activity. A lot of time is wasted in a group practice situation that makes it far less effective. This type of solitary Deliberate Practice is well suited to introverts.

* We need a new kind of diversity in this world. While we have come to understand and appreciate the need for racial and gender diversity

* Not all leaders are extroverts, and Rosa Parks as all quiet, shy people initially that decided that they had to get something done. This determination to meet their goals was authentic, and is what gave them such force of personality.

* Introverts often take time to bloom

* Cain identified a problem called ""The New Groupthink"" which is a belief that group projects are always the best way to do things. This is nearly always difficult for introverts, teachers are now urged to do more and more group projects with students, to the point where kids aren't doing anything on their own, which isn't the best way for all of them to learn. There needs to be a balance.

You can find many other insights and tips like the above in the book itself. And if Susan Cain comes on a tour to your town, and it was amusing to be in a crowd of introverts.

Hope you find these useful. As I did in an earlier post I wrote, and try to tease out more practical, concrete ways to live as an introvert.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,,http://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/17o8if/just_got_back_from_a_lecture_by_susan_cain_author/

You have two options to choose from:

Option A: /r/introvert may only contain posts that reflect introversion in a positive view

Option B: /r/introvert will remain a place where all users can freely post any content they feel is related to introversion.

Option C: (For Informative knowledge Only) Thanks to /u/GideonJWells You have the third option /r/introvertpride, this is a place where you can go to show your pride of being an introvert:)

He told me she has friends that she talks about when she comes home from school. So it isn't like she doesn't speak to anyone

1364667404.0,1bba1u,10 Myths About Introverts,DJStoa,235,85,29,"Myth #1 – Introverts don’t like to talk.
This is not true. Introverts just don’t talk unless they have something to say. They hate small talk. Get an introvert talking about something they are interested in

Myth #2 – Introverts are shy.
Shyness has nothing to do with being an Introvert. Introverts are not necessarily afraid of people. What they need is a reason to interact. They don’t interact for the sake of interacting. If you want to talk to an Introvert

Myth #3 – Introverts are rude.
Introverts often don’t see a reason for beating around the bush with social pleasantries. They want everyone to just be real and honest. Unfortunately, which they find exhausting.

Myth #4 – Introverts don’t like people.
On the contrary, you’re in.

Myth #5 – Introverts don’t like to go out in public.
Nonsense. Introverts just don’t like to go out in public FOR AS LONG. They also like to avoid the complications that are involved in public activities. They take in data and experiences very quickly, recharge, and process it all. In fact, recharging is absolutely crucial for Introverts.

Myth #6 – Introverts always want to be alone.
Introverts are perfectly comfortable with their own thoughts. They think a lot. They daydream. They like to have problems to work on

Myth #7 – Introverts are weird.
Introverts are often individualists. They don’t follow the crowd. They’d prefer to be valued for their novel ways of living. They think for themselves and because of that

Myth #8 – Introverts are aloof nerds.
Introverts are people who primarily look inward

Myth #9 – Introverts don’t know how to relax and have fun.
Introverts typically relax at home or in nature

Myth #10 – Introverts can fix themselves and become Extroverts.
A world without Introverts would be a world with few scientists, poets, filmmakers, doctors, mathematicians, writers, and philosophers. That being said, I reversed these two terms on purpose to show you how biased our society is.) Introverts cannot “fix themselves” and deserve respect for their natural temperament and contributions to the human race. In fact

While the default state of the average introvert is far from being happy

As an introvert you are aware of much more than the average person, doubt and a general feeling of malaise.

This happens because you're not using your ability in a way that's beneficial to your state of mind. Instead of a weakness introversion becomes your greatest strenght.

* When you're in a group of people don't zone-out, a story or something you agree with [or not agree with] and just let your body to the talking. IOW, be present in the group without necessarily participating in the conversation.

* When you feel you need to recharge, check your email for a while, it doesn't matter. Don't extend yourself if you don't have to.

* When you act with kindess, patronising and anger. 

* Don't apologise for who you are if your intentions as a human being are sincere. Always be sincere no matter what. Most of us have a hard time with insincerety anyways

* Look inwards first to find your answers

* When you find yourself dwelling on an issue, think of another positive memory and keep doing this [and that takes time] until you forget about the issue.

This last trick of the mind is the greatest single piece of advice I can give you. Also

1344860431.0,y53ff,Where are the hard introverts at?,,193,47,160,"I'm beginning to wonder if I fit in here.

It seems as though most of the people on this board are more or less average people who do average things

There's only one person in my life whom I consider truly essential to my happiness, but if for some reason I was never able to see them again, I wouldn't feel particularly bad. I enjoy hanging out with them for short periods of time if we're doing something engaging (Such as playing RPGs), but even during those times I barely say anything to them. This does not really bother me, even if I'm sitting there silent while everyone else talks. Aside from these times, 90% of my time is spent in my house.

I'd be more likely to cast my lot in with the hard introverts, etc. That's not to say I'm mean-spirited. If I'm in a position to help another person, I feel glad to do it, but I don't desire a personal connection with them. Humans are just...there, to me. They're like machines or animals, just things I have to deal with in my normal life. I take great pleasure in observing and understand them, I'm partial in particular to fields such as sociology and economics, I would much rather avoid it.

Nor do I suffer from social anxiety. If I'm put in a position where I must interact with other humans, but I can do the bare minimum in order to not come off as totally inept. Sometimes, with close friends, I can even go as far as to make myself seem like an engaging person. Again, I don't take any pleasure in this, it's just something that's a part of life, and I'll avoid it if I can. All my hobbies are self-sufficient, and I find that most of the time people get in the way of that. I find social hobbies, but sometimes downright disgusting.

For a while I suspected I had Schizoid Personality ""Disorder, or else I do feel unhappy.

tl;dr I'm a shut-in who is generally completely apathetic towards social interaction. A lot of people here seem to enjoy socializing

PS: Before I piss anyone off, I don't care. I was only wondering if there were any other ""shut-in"" introverts here.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,False,,

I thought I might have been late at first and my stomach was doing back flips but turning up the volume of my music helped a bit. When I turned on the exit ramp to the theater I caught a glimpse of the person in front of me and he had a vague resemblance to the guy was meeting. The car in front ended up going ahead at a turn and I lost sight. Then when I got to the theater parking lot there was the same car with the guy I was to see Prometheus with stepping out. I ended up parking right next to him. Then started the awkward hellos. He said ""So we have met now."" I said ""mission accomplished?"" Then lots and lots of small talk. The theater that Prometheus was in was a weird theater that was half theater half restaurant [Here is picture for those who don't get what I am explaining.](http://www.marcustheatres.com/Files/Theatres/Media/770_springdale_road_MLS_HID552736_ROOMpaladium.jpg) He has never been in this type of theater (I don't think he liked it :P)

We talked lot before the movie started and during the movie neither of us talked to each other. (Which in my book it is a good point because it meant to me that he and I both know how to enjoy a good movie.)

*This is sort of a side note but I LOVED THE MOVIE!! I love Alien and Aliens I really enjoyed the story

Afterwards we talked about what we liked about the movie and what we didn't quite understand or what we thought was stupid. For the most part we completely agreed and over all we both thoroughly enjoyed it. We both walked back to our cars and he sat on the trunk of his car and I leaned up against mine. We talked about other things than the movie and it started to drizzle and it wasn't too bad of a nuisance (kinda nice actually

Over all I was really impressed with myself to keep talking and keep a clear mind. In the past I would have locked up and say nothing and my mind would be a blur with thoughts of: ""am I acting stupid?""

For as long as I can remember, of personality and belief, stir behind the towering, ivory gate that holds it at bay. Beyond, the surface of the river is conversely calm and placid, pleasant if a bit shallow and cool.

The dam is powerful, each with failsafes and duplicates and a repair crew on constant stand-by to fix even the most insignificant of wear and tear.

When I meet someone, that behemoth of a structure that holds an unknown torrent at bay. The seething, boiling energies of this endlessly deep, violently passionate reservoir, so many times the size of that which is visible on the far side.

And then someone comes along who dares to approach it, begins to trust them, to test them by opening each just a crack, allowing a small modicum of the warmth and power of the reservoir to slip through and into the stream.

As a writer

What really sets them off, with their own unique connotations: those which reassure, those of affection, the sexual, the dismissive, all conveyed through just a momentary, lingering point of contact or, an almost reflexive retreat.

That one person finds that combination of words, of that sparkle in the eye, of their own willful vulnerability. It is for them that the dam breaks.

For them, failsafes held at bay as the torrent rushes out to meet this solitary adventurer, to engulf them and pull them back in, beneath the undulating surface where everything is laid bare. I can hardly imagine what it’s like to learn so suddenly that something like this exists within this person that you perhaps thought you already knew, and I have nothing but awe and respect for those who can brave it and come out closer still.

For them, bathe in it, seek to cleanse it or poison it and I will have no more means by which to stop them. That is the brunt of how I love. It can be the most glorious feeling one can imagine or the most tortuous of emotional agonies. It is because of the strength of it alone that I am so loathe to let the dam fall, to allow even the most outwardly kind and accepting of people to see what lies within.

What I notice in extroverts is that they don't think much before they talk so their questions to us

**""Why are you so shy?""**

: *Trust me

I usually smile or laugh when I say this. I imagine saying this with a blank face will scare people. I like replying with this because it stays in line with our character

If this doesn't work and they follow up with something like **""Oh come on you're so shy or but you're so quiet""/ "" Why are you so quiet?""** 

: I automatically put on my blahblah radar. Not only is this person still chatting about nothing substantial and not contributing but s/he is putting all the pressure on me to lead the conversation.  
Usually I divert and say something among the lines of 

*Ah sorry

*... work earlier

*... planning what to make for dinner. I just started to learn how to cook.*

etc. Of course this isn't like a step by step telemarketing manual. The idea is to keep the conversation going. Use your hobbies

If I feel like that the person/stranger is being an asshole and I most likely have no interest in seeing them again. I usually reply with something more on the offense. *Give me something to talk about.*  
 
Extroverts love talking about nothing. We know this

Go ahead and start helping the host, being helpful is always a great thing. From there new conversations can start. *Thanks for throwing this party. You okay with drinks?* 

**""What do you do for a living?""** 

This is a tricky question depending on your situation. Cause it's either you have a nice ideal long-term job or a sucky I dont want to do this for the rest of my life job. 

In my case I have a food-service job yes it's not the greatest but the objective is to keep the conversation on a high note

*""Currently I'm a hostess It's fun

Everyone can relate to debt. It also shows that you're managing your life and making big-boy decisions. 

*Non-related Tip: Did you know in Japan this question at first meet basis is considered rude and intruding? In Japanese culture

Sorry went a bit off topic and documentary-esque there. Obviously an introvert. 

**""What's new?""** 

This is by far the easiest question and the most favorited by extroverts. You can say almost anything and it'd be fine. The point is to pick up the conversation. 
*Ah nothing really
It doesn't have to be a personal achievement or a picked up hobby. Most introverts think waaay too hard into the simplest questions. Our minds can be our best friend and worst enemy.

1355058018.0,14jo5a,Shamed by my American roommate for being an introvert,,149,28,122,"This is a rant. I'm just getting very fed up.
I'm female, and very comfortable with being an introvert. When I'm out during the day my energy depletes extremely quickly, interacting with others is enjoyable but draining, and during the weekends I enjoy sleeping in, then spending the day reading, working on my book, or my screen play, as well watching movies and listening to albums. I go out a few nights of the month and party it up with my close group of friends. I'm in no way a boring person. In fact, and outgoing. I've never questioned any of this. I've always known that I need ample time to myself and I know how not to over-extend myself when it comes to being with people.


However, always to very touristy clubs (my friends and I enjoy going to rock or jazz bars when we're not hanging out at someone's flat drinking and watching movies) or expensive restaurants. We're both students at the same uni and while she can't sleep in past 10:00 no matter when she's gone to bed, I need at least 9 hours of sleep a night. Every Saturday and Sunday when I emerge from my room around lunch-time (13-14:00), she's sitting in the kitchen and looks at me like I have six eyes. ""You're *just* now getting up?"" Yeah, well, I stayed up until 6:00 listening to American Beauty. Not that you would understand; how's that new electro-house playlist anyway?
Her comments are really starting to get to me

""I can't be inside for more than an hour. I have to leave and walk around and shop or something.""

""What do you *do* all day? I can't just sit inside at my computer all day like a mindless zombie.""

""You eat the same thing every single day. I would get so bored.""

""How do you not want to be out all the time? We live in such a beautiful city (Madrid) and you don't even care.""


I've never met anyone who cares about the way I live. I've never met anyone who has said ANYTHING about how much time I spend to myself. I'm in no means a recluse, waiting for her to leave so I could go out and make my rice &amp; eggs in peace. Then I realized how fucked up it is that I was locking myself in my room to avoid her judgement. Then I realized something else- I would hate to feel like I can't be inside for more than an hour. To me, it seems like a sign of anxiety. I can't imagine not enjoying lounging around the house in my robe for the hell of it, snacking and watching a movie. I can't imagine constantly feeling the need to talk to someone, or go out and spend money, all because I feel so restless and trapped *all the time*. I don't know if she feels anxiety, perhaps it's the same kind of anxiety I get when I've been around people for too long, than the life she lives.


I'm sorry for the wall of text. I've never felt social anxiety before but I am with this girl and I needed to vent to someone.

Edit: Some have pointed out that I sound pretentious when comparing our interests. I totally do. I sound like a bitch. I was trying to keep the rant concise and didn't take the time to point out that I don't think anything she (or anyone) does is of lesser quality than the things I like to do. I should have taken the time to explain that she also asks questions about why I do the things I do, they are bad.",,False,,t5_2qlr2,1355082119.0,,

I even reminded her of this every single day until Thursday. She nodded, said one of the following: ""Of course I'm coming!"" / ""Oh hell yes!

**I'm going to add an edit to the beginning as well. When you read this quote, and I understand that the quote can be a bit harsh. But seriously, stop and think for a bit. Trust me, I'm introverted, Aspie, used to be horridly shy and socially anxious. And sure, this quote pissed me off a little bit at first. But when I thought about it it has substance to it. It may not be a blanket statement, whether or not you like it or are offended by it. And dammit it motivated me to push myself past my social limits of the time and dammit it worked. Right now it's not about whether you like the quote or ""feel like"" it applies to you or are offended. It can be just as vain to believe you are immune to it as what the quote is saying itself. You are not all so different in your shyness(if you are) that you are completely exempt from the quote because of how you feel. Take a moment to learn and reflect



As everyone knows and/or complains about, being anti-social, and introversion, all of which are not necessarily together.

So I figured I would use an interesting quote I saw to get your attention. ""Shyness is just a cowards vanity."" A lot of people feel like they're introverts just because they're shy. But why? I'm introverted, I also like to go hang out with friends, I even like to go to friend's parties and meet people.

I've heard it mentioned before that some introverts feel superior or entitled to something because they're introverted in an ""extrovert"" world. And sadly

""Shyness is just a cowards vanity."" Perhaps that is why some people are shy

Now I'm not saying this is the case for all shy people

EDIT: I want to re-emphasize, I still can be, and often was for a long time, but you can learn from the statement. Just because it doesn't sound ""nice"" doesn't meany anything.

The difference, for instance, am proud of my introversion -- it's made me who I am, and while life is sometimes challenging because of it, I welcome that challenge because it makes me stronger and I thrive on overcoming that occasional adversity.

Ive lived in the US of A for about 2 years now and am i junior in highschool. I feel like im in a introverts hell just because whenever i say something (which is rare) it causes a wave of reaction and direct questioning due to the accent which makes me feel very uncomfotabl . Once in homeroom i was made to stand up infront of the class just so they could hear me speak :(

Ive always hated being the centre of attension and was wondering if anyone has some tips i could use to get by.
Im happy with who i am and learning how to speak with an american accent is not an option :D

Now that I'm in college though, my issue is that after spending 5 hours by myself in my dorm room, I get really lonely.  My dorm is almost always deserted, and when I am in crowds of strangers, I still get this lonely feeling.  Aren't introverts supposed to enjoy time to themselves?  

I think my issue lies in the fact that I don't like socializing, play sports, or go to movies.  Here in college, the only people who I really like are the people on my sports team, and I really enjoy just being with them, even though I hardly talk.  I also grew up in a large family, so at home I would always be surrounded with people I liked

This is making it really hard for me to find and make new friends.  Has anyone here experienced something similar?  Does anyone have tips or suggestions?  Am I really an introvert?

A situation for me that I find to be the most frustrating is when reading something.  I feel like my brain reads too fast and I'm reciting as I'm reading.  Sometimes it gets so bad that I have to re-read entire pages a few times.  This I know may be more of a psych thing but I wondered if maybe it was because I'm so involved in my head that I can't just read and take in what is in front of me.  This has definitely caused major problems in school for me.

EDIT: Thanks for all the input!  I agree that a lot of people are probably just very good at keeping their ""poker face"" on.  As a teenager I came up with this explanation for myself that people who seem to me to not be distracted by their inner mind ramblings are ""surface dwellers"".  This to me means that they live their lives only be affected by what is in direct contact with them.  They only see what's on the ""surface"" so to speak.  Maybe not so much an introversion thing but I figured if anyone was going to understand what I meant it would be you guys.

She was mostly upset because I want to move her son out of a self-confined math class and into a general education classroom. Most parents are thrilled that their child is progressing and is moving towards inclusion with their non-disabled peers.

I have been thinking this over for over 6 hours

I also have an IEP meeting with her

Thanks :)

Edit: I tried to answer some questions and comments the best I could in my free period. I appreciate all the advice. I'll try to check back before the meeting tonight and respond to some others. I'll also report back tonight after the meeting and fill everyone in on what happened.

Edit 2: We finished up the meeting around 7pm. I used some of the tips many of you kindly provided. The meeting went much better than I expected and planned for. The mother came in, and could be labeled as different. We talk with her and the student, and told her that once a week I or another teacher would drop by to observe the student (as was our original plan). 

The meeting ended and she apologized a few more times and left. 

We shall see what tomorrow holds. The student shall not begin his transition until next week. 

I thank you all for your help and suggestions. I used many of the ideas,True,,t5_2qlr2,1348014103.0,,,t3_102b98

A small patch of steam was rising up in front of me, we carried on; eventually finding the trail again.




We finished the trail, looking down into the valley. 30 seconds later, I heard the rain coming. I listened as the volume steadily increased until the rain was pouring down above me. I watched as the leaves on the trees slightly moved as the raindrops hit them. It was like the forest was breathing. The sun was shining and I felt I could see every individual drop.



I kept walking, my happiness turned to sadness as I realized that I wish that I had someone to share this with; someone who appreciates these things as much as me (preferably a cute girl). So, any introverts here like hiking? :)

*“Loneliness does not come from having no people about one

Being an introvert does not mean you are lonely

My question is how much the desire for one is a gateway to the other.

I'm asking this because I recently started feeling lonely in a way that I've never felt before and I think my introversion might be a strong contributor.

Making and keeping friends involves spending time with them, which was alright because I had maybe one or two friends I could spend time with. But I've recently moved to a new city and started a new job. Everything else was left behind and I started a new life. But my introversion has been making it very difficult to meet people and I've been feeling lonely and slightly depressed.

So in which ways is introversion related to loneliness? How many of you consider yourselves to be lonely in your aloneness? How do you cope with it?

Now, it'd be wonderful to hang out every weekend, but in order to do that, people want to *go out* to bars, restaurants, clubs, etc. What ever happened to inviting someone to your house and cooking for them? Or watching a movie together in your room? Or even just shooting the shit and gossipping at home?

After a while, and then when I finally was left alone as I'd always wanted, I felt incredibly lonely. I tried to break out of my shell and realised I'd forgotten how to make friends.

1349810621.0,117kqz,Introversion and Loneliness: Falling Victim to Perception,postoasties,87,17,10,"*This* ***is not*** *meant to be taken as a generalization

*This is* ***my*** *profile; an illustration of how* ***I*** *became victim to my own perceptions


***Introversion vs. Social Anxiety***

I am not akin to social anxiety, solitude, and warmth of my own thoughts and wanderings.  Either with the few whom I call friend or in the welcoming, vast reaches of my inner thoughts is where and when I feel most at home.  My spoken word is scarcely heard.  But when it is, my every meaning, my every care, respect, few

*Yes,* I prefer the pages of a heart-felt poem or story over the shallow musings of most modern reality tv-shows and pop-music bands.  *But . .* this does not mean that I do not enjoy company at times.  This does not mean that I purposely cast myself aside in attempt to avoid fitting in.  I am simply me.  Me is the only me I know how to be; *and I am happy with who I am.*

***Loneliness mingles with hopes and dreams***

I know what it is to be alone.  I know the painful emptiness, held-hands, love, and happiness seem just a friend away.  I know the frustration that shadows the footsteps of missed opportunities; the women in my life that never were, and the friendships that could have been.  

*I know these tears

I know both *chosen* loneliness, and I.  

*I know what it is to be aware of my own loneliness . . . even when I am surrounded by those who love me.*

***Growing***

When age and discipline come to pass and the tyrannical reign of chemicals and youthful angst are torn down, becomes a friendly place.  I slowly crawled out of my cage into the sunlight; forgotten since my innocence.  I was reminded that the stranger, too, has thoughts, hopes, and dreams.  I was reminded that what I knew as home was not the only place in this world where I could stretch and enjoy myself. 

I became aware of what I was, relationships, and goals I previously felt unattainable.  I learned that reaching the seemingly unreachable can push me farther than I ever thought possible.  I learned that the world was not my enemy; but a garden, bountiful, offering fruit to those who overcame its challenges.  

*But most importantly

*I was the ever-elusive construct; I had facilitated my own misery.*

***New Experiences***

With new experiences comes new knowledge and understanding.  I had come to learn that the feelings and thoughts wandering the halls were things called perceptions.  I came to learn that my moods, thought processes, and pre-conceived notions all influenced how I perceived the world, myself, and my place in it.  I went to college; I opened my eyes to various schools of thought.  There I found an environment that didn’t constrain thought and effort to pencil and test.  I found an environment that encouraged the curious mind.  A place and a people that valued an open mind.  I found friends and mentors I could open up to and share in the revelry of unchained ambition.  

*And

***Acceptance and Understanding***

While I am free of my cage, I am still figuring out where my place is in this world.  It's what drives my interests in Psychology.  It drives me to better understand myself and my perceptions.  To be more cognitively aware of my surroundings and those who inhabit them.

*Through understanding

*Through new experiences

*And through new relations

*I am an Introvert



***Closing thoughts***

For the few who truly understand what it means to walk the line between self and one’s self

Having spent so much time in our cages, and conquer it.  Keep taking on challenges and, over time, build up confidence in yourself.  Learn to trust yourself and to believe in your goals.



***ADDENDUM:  Depression and Introversion***

While depression and introversion are not mutually dependent, *seek help.*  *There is no shame in a helping hand.*

I think it's pretty important to make sure that like minded folk are spared the same experience.

First, that of course you want to chit-chat! They'll talk about the weather or where you're from and you'll cringe because none of this matters and you'd rather either zone out or have some type of real conversation rather than superficial nonsense. But the people who love cruises seem like they're all extraverts and it's not always their strong suit to understand that some of us *like* being alone.

Second, the waiter asked ""Why are you so lonely?"" and because this was at the end of the cruise and I was frustrated, I retorted with ""Just because I'm alone doesn't mean I'm lonely."" His smirk turned serious and he apologized for joking but after being questioned again and again if I really only wanted a table for one, I needed to say *something*. My husband isn't a breakfast person so I ate it alone every day. Is it so strange that someone would enjoy a quiet meal sipping tea and staring out at the ocean? 

The few times when we did feel most happy and comfortable were usually at dinner or in the one little bar that seemed to be on the ship only for us. We chose the dinners that were an extra cost because we realized that we were bombarded with chatty vacationers much less. And our little bar

I'm wondering if anyone else on this subreddit has had similar experience.  

Let me summarize the social protocol for a typical dance.  

1. Ask someone to dance.  They almost always say yes.
2. Dance with them for 1 (or 3 in the case of tango) song(s).  
3. Thank them for the dance and you're done.  

Why do I think this is ideal for introverts?  I'll use letters this time.

A) Club dancing is difficult for me because I don't know what I'm supposed to do so I feel like I'm just randomly flailing.  In partner dancing there are lessons so you can actually know what you're doing.  
 
B) You get to deal with one person at a time - very manageable.  Also

C) The end of a dance is a totally natural, you can just say that you want to go dance.

Horrendously, sweltering ocean.

I can't seem to make friends. I quit drinking over a year ago and I haven't been able to get close to anyone in the time since. I had two close drinking friends and obviously I can't be around them much any more. I've made a few acquaintances but there's nobody I spend time with, nobody to go hiking. I don't get invited places very often, and when I do I'm usually too exhausted to go (insane schedule with school, work, therapy, etc.) I think I have a reputation as a ""refuser"" because of this, because people don't understand that I **want** to do stuff- you bet your ass I'd love to- but I'm *fucking tired.* 

Even if I weren't tired, I usually sit by myself in silence and when I do speak up I get ignored. I vastly prefer one-on-one interaction. Or even online interaction. But I feel like when I reach out to people on these levels I get rejected. Not to mention the silent panic I feel in groups, where my brain tells me, ""RUN! GET OUT! GET OUT OF HERE! GO!!!"" And I give in to the panic more often than not, because I feel woefully unequipped to fight it.

I don't understand what I'm doing wrong, but I'm alone. Me and my book. Me and my car. Me and my plants. Me and the internet. A lot of the time I'm perfectly content to be by myself, but I'd like maybe just once a week or so to just have a nice relaxed time out of the house with someone. Lately I just feel suffocated under my own loneliness and the weight of my responsibilities. I feel like it's been ages since I did anything enjoyable.

It is perhaps

I enjoy doing things with my family all the time but I am very “back and forth” I am good with doing something all of us together for a short time and then I want to be left alone to do my thing and then I want to do things again for a bit and then go back to being left alone.   I am sure it is difficult for my wife and I know she doesn’t understand it completely because I am often not left alone to be by myself for a bit and this can cause some anxiety or frustration.   And the lack of understanding who I am makes me feel lonely within my own family.

At the same time, I feel like I protect myself because I feel as though I love too much or get too emotionally invested that I try to dial it back so it doesn’t seem strange and so that I don’t get hurt by silly things.

When it comes to friends I am more open with them but only a couple.  These are the friends I grew up with that I love like a brother and sister though I do not know I ever really said that to them.   We have been friends for nearly 30 years.   I don’t even like to call them friends they are so much more… but as I’ve grown older, more introverted… making any kind of new friend is extremely difficult because I just do not find that I relate and I’m so guarded.    It’s tough to be surrounded by people and yet still feel lonely.   I wish more people understood me.  I often wish I could be different.

Increasingly, to me, is direly unfortunate.

Almost every day of my life I wish to just sit behind the scenes and not have to meet up with people just to network. It's a dream to me. But more and more

It's just not *me*. And many people don't understand it -- especially in the workplace. My close friends understand it

I've always been a huge proponent of introversion. It's a beautiful thing and it's great to help others who feel as though it's not normal. It just gets to you sometimes

I think we all agree

• at college (outside the lectures): of course, but in most cases the time you get to know people its boring small talk. And I hate small talk. So I just give short answers, people misinterpretend this as offending behaviour and stop talking to me, making me isolated in the class community.

• at the doctor: I visit the pedriatist monthly

• going out: I denied invitations from my extroverted friends for some weeks now

Those were just some examples. In most cases I have to pretend being more extroverted than I am (I'm quite the introverted person), I'm not the only introverted person with strange hobbies. However, I claim that some interests attract introverted people in special. Some stuff I REALLY like: speedcubing, kendo, anime, artisan crafts, doing photoshop stuff, sitting on the bed listening to music for hours.

___

I'm an extremely extroverted person, it makes me anxious about if I'm talking too much or if she's uncomfortable.

I also have a lot of introverted friends. Most of my friends are. I'm in an international high-school system that is known for having a lot of introverted people in it. Most of the time everybody (-else than the clique of extroverts we have-) just keeps to themselves. I like all of my friends, they're the best ones. Deep and philosophical without saying anything that they don't see as valuable to the discussion. But I have a hard time interacting with them. I don't know if it's me being obnoxious, which I'm afraid of being, or because they're introverted.


Anyways

* As an extrovert
* Are there any things that extroverts probably don't know about introverts which I should know?
* Any general tips on how to interact with introverted people?
* Will our relationship suffer from the differences in our personalities?
* If it will suffer

____

Also, and with the meditation I have been doing, I will hopefully reach the same levels of interior observational skills as you have.

It's as if you've established your dominance and there are those which are not impressed by it

Being the introvert quiet type, I notice some interesting changes.

So, I was in meetings from 9 AM to 2 PM, had another social event to go to from 2 - 5 PM, had dinner with a bunch of friends from 5 - 7 PM at a fancy grill, attended a networking convention from 7 - 9:30 PM and got driven home by a colleague.

Even [Amy Cuddly's TED Talk](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ks-_Mh1QhMc) on Body Language (one of the best TED talks I've ever seen, i.e., you come off as more confident in a job interview if you power-pose for a couple minutes before the interview. I've actually tried this myself and it does indeed work. I noticed a drastic improvement in my verbal communication abilities and body language during the interviews that I power-posed beforehand.

So whenever someone tells me to ""Be who I am"", and I'm going to keep faking it till I become it. Fuck, sometimes it just hurts that I can't live the way I want to because I wouldn't get anywhere if I did. I just used the good old ""If you can't beat 'em, join 'em"" advice and I fake extroversion on a daily basis now. If any of you watch the TV show Dexter, you'll know what I mean. He's a hardcore introvert and survives by seeming normal to the outside world.

It was a pretty big party in a small apartment, and then ran out of steam. That was probably the moment when I should have left, but I stayed... because I would have been the first to go, and also because I do enjoy taking part in conversations by simply listening and smiling. Mind you, I was not the only one - there were a couple of others doing the same thing. But I made the mistake of taking out my phone and playing a quick game while waiting for the right moment to call it a night.

That's when the Loud-Mouthed Patronizing Extrovert (LoMPE) spotted this preposterous transgression, LoMPE attacked me with an avalanche of words too numerous to remember. Something along the lines of ""YOU KNOW THIS IS A SOCIAL EVENT, RIGHT? YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO SO-CIA-LIZE."", but stretched into enough words to power her mini-gun-like style of conversation for much longer than necessary. And certainly loud enough for everyone to hear over the music and all the conversations that were already fighting said music themselves.

So I had to signal to her that if she actually wants to hear an explanation, but that's the way it works. Yes, I could go home and sleep, but you don't get to tell me to do that.

And then I began to explain how there's always someone like her at a party, congratulating me on being brave enough to leave my house and go to a social event. How I end up feeling bad for starting to hate a person who never meant to make me uncomfortable, who obviously meant well and may even be genuinely interested in something they know they don't understand. And how she must be feeling very clever for pulling me into a conversation about not being able to have another conversation.

1) Whenever I get seafood when we're out, to his surprise, but most of the time he quietly washes it down.

I explained to him that to me, he can't be surprised if I refuse over and over, or say okay and then change my mind when the seafood is looming near to my face. I also explained that I NEVER force him to eat seafood, especially not via guilt, but he DOES force me to socialize, through making me feel bad about my personality/preferences.

2) He loves D&amp;D and Warmachines with his friends. I've played both here and there but really don't have a vested interest in either.

I'm a front-end developer and Wordpress guy.  I work at a non-profit organization with more than 30 websites.  They, CSS, PHP, Javascript, Content Management System, etc.  I am the first person here with my level of experience and skill set.  To a degree they are still fleshing out my role here.

So what does that mean?  I sit in front of a computer and figure out ways to improve processes here.  Create mockups, plan, mockup, propose.

I think I do a fine job and so does my supervisor but guess what: The president of the company

Why?  Partly because he doesn't understand what I do (he gets irritated when people talk about technical issues).  Spending my time coding and planning means I don't have enough ""visual"" things to show him.  

The other reason he wants to fire me?  I'm not enough of a ""team player"" and I think this relates to me being introverted (and relates to the nature of my job).

**I am confused and stupefied.**

My girlfriend suggested to me that it may be due to my introverted nature. I forget that this is a problem sometimes.  I feel very naive about it.  I don't have a lot of job experience.  I've either worked from home or have been in school for several years.  So this is strange to me.

I've tried online, but it's like diamonds in the rough, and the rough is full of weird and creepy people.  I've gone and tried some open source contribution -- which was an interesting challenge, and full of smart people, but it's all work-focused -- not a place to make friends.  I've done some online tabletop gaming and roleplay -- something I did in-person in college -- but it almost never turns out well and I'm honestly pretty terrible at it.

Now, or even how much quiet time I need. I love her and don't want to hurt her feelings, but she believes that conversation needs to keep continually going, and in the past has gotten mad at me for being too quiet!

Is there any way that I can politely say that when she mindlessley blathers it sucks the energy out of me? (It can be really easy to offend her - she is better now but has the potential to go into crazy screaming woman mode)
Thank you!


Edit: Thank everyone for their responses! I read them all and now feel more confident going into this. For all the people telling me to ""suck it up"" I do understand where you are coming from. She is my mom and I love her very much. However, with both her and I pretty much learning who I am at the same time. I am at a point with my mental health now where I can concentrate on myself, not just my Depression and Anxiety, which was taking over about 90% of my cognitive functions. She wants to understand my needs, it's just the issue of explaining them to her in a way that will not hurt her feelings/lose it on me.

I have struggled with this literally all my life. I talk fast. I mumble. And no matter how many times I've tried to work on it

Someone gave me some advice a few weeks ago: think about every individual word as you are saying it. It seemed silly and simple but it seemed to do the trick immediately. 

Instead of saying sentences in...well...sentences..say them word by word. 

Example: Instead of saying ""Hi

Reading this, but it will come off much more natural if you tend to talk fast. The more you do it, the more natural it will seem.

For me, they were easier to understand. And because I was taking more time to say *each* word, it gave me a better chance to enunciate each one. 

An unexpected result was that my ""ums"" and ""ahs"" and ""likes"" decreased and my vocabulary increased. I found that I was often talking way faster than my brain was actually processing sentences. This lead to me not really getting my point out clearly and coherently but rather in a jumble. When I was trying to say something but I wouldn't give myself enough time to think of the word I wanted to use, more accurate, more intelligent words would come out allowing me to get my point across much better. Those pauses would also allow me to think about what I was saying first, instead of thinking *as* I was talking so what I was saying was actually more thought out.

And ALL of this almost immediately lead to a huge boost in confidence for me because its been something Ive been struggling with forever. Nearly the next day

It's to the point now where I'm excited to talk to people just so I can try out my new voice. It's like getting a new toy. 

TLDR: slow down and think about each word individually as you speak it and you will get tons of chicks.

As I grew older, romantically.

It starts with a common ground, when I become interested in a potential partner, I can't seem to shake it off and I get annoyingly attached to them despite wanting to be alone otherwise. It's like they always have that exception; that 'undeserved advantage' over the other people in my life who probably want to see me more often. (I say 'undeserved' because I have had a few failed relationships after which I've realised it may be best *not* to show how much I like them; my family and friends deserve my attention more).

Even after wearing my heart on my sleeve, I still know that I yearn for a close, affectionate relationship with a partner. I feel myself getting strangely attached to them, even though I'm mature enough to be able to read signals telling me it won't work - but I don't usually feel the need to be around friends or people in general. It's almost as if other relationships are 'unsatisfying'. While this can be a good thing (I read that many introverts don't have thousands of friends, but have very strong relationships with the few close to them), I fear that I get uncontrollably attached to every potential partner. I may not show it any more, but I certainly feel it and it's often unpleasant.

1339174435.0,ursxn,DAE not think in language? A theory I have about why social interaction can be so draining.,DrStephenPoop,52,12,49,"Hi folks

I only learned within the past year (on a DAE reddit post) that some people's thoughts actually use language. Until then

It seemed pretty split in the thread: that about half the people thought in words, connections, memories, maybe some phrases.

Times when I might think using language are if I'm trying to parse something very logical out

Which brings me to the point: I know that part of the reason social interaction is exhausting for me is that I have to parse my thoughts into language. It's like adding an extra step

An example:

I know that if my bosses asks me ""What do you think about this design?"" if I were to simply put voice to my thoughts it would go something like:

""Bad. Ugly. Smooshed. Can better. Not liking. Trim. That there that there that there.""

But in order to not sound like a potato-head

I'm an INFP. I can see this as maybe being an Introvert trait (it makes social interaction draining); or possibly a Intuiting trait (I think about connections rather than concrete objects); or even a Feeling trait (my initial reaction is often a sense of who I feel about something rather than a logical thought). It could even be a Perceiving trait because it's not as orderly as a Judging trait

**tl;dr I don't thinking in language and have to parse my thoughts before speaking. I find this exhausting. Anyone else?**

So I've been having ideas again
 
I'm an introvert. I recently quit my job. I currently plan to take a year out. My goal is to read a lot

As an introvert I struggle with normal office life. It makes me miserable. The emails, the small talk, the expectations.

I want out and I am taking this year to go at that hell for leather. I may fail but at least I've gone down fighting.

My plan is to try and make an income online. Other people can do it, trying to generate interest in a lot of the different business ideas I have.

So I guess this must be a common dream for introverts and I thought I'd reach out and see if anyone would like to form a group of people striving for the same goal.

We'd set up some kind of private forum and then we'd chat about where we are at, co-operate on projects.

So if you are running online businesses or want to then you join the collective and we help. Even if you know nothing about online business then if you have the english language skills to type a post on reddit you have value to add.

Things I could see the collective doing -

- giving advice on business ideas
- giving technical advice - best wordpress theme
- swapping links and guest posts on each others blogs and sites
- comment on each others articles
- helping seed each others forums when they start out
- help and encouragement in a private community
- outsource paid work to each other (article writing

25% are introverts

**Extraversion** is ""the act, talkative, assertive, and gregarious. They take pleasure in activities that involve large social gatherings, such as parties, community activities, public demonstrations, and they are more prone to boredom when they are by themselves.

**Introversion** is ""the state of or tendency toward being wholly or predominantly concerned with and interested in one's own mental life"".[3] Introverts tend to be more reserved and less outspoken in large groups. They often take pleasure in solitary activities such as reading, and using computers. The archetypal artist, writer, sculptor, engineer, composer, and inventor are all highly introverted. An introvert is likely to enjoy time spent alone and find less reward in time spent with large groups of people

Introversion is not the same as shyness or the social outcast. Introverts choose solitary over social activities by preference

Introverts process their emotions, but reveal less about themselves than extroverts do. Introverts are more private, and less public. Introverts need time to think before responding to a situation, and develop their ideas by reflecting privately. 
When introverts want to be alone, a sign of depression. It means that they either need to regain their energy from being around people or that they simply want the time to be with their own thoughts. Being with people, even people they like and are comfortable with, can prevent them from their desire to be quietly introspective.

Introverts can focus their attention more readily and for longer periods of time than extroverts, different, or awkward. 

**Where Extroverts Get Their Energy**

EXTROverts get their energy when they go out and do social activities. It recharges them.

**Where Introverts Get Their Energy:**
Introverts tend to get their energy from within, daydreaming, painting, or gardening – any solo activity fills them up again. This doesn't mean introverts have to live alone in a cave in the hills or on Walden Pond; they just need quiet time to come back to themselves. The energy source for introverts is from within.
