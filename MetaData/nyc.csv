Backstory—friend couldn’t make it to philharmonic at last minute so I went alone, HORRIFIC date.  Then got this.

Subject: Hi Lauren

Hi Lauren
 
I’m disappointed in you. I’m disappointed that I haven’t gotten a response to my voicemail and text messages.
 
FYI, and are easier to misinterpret than in-person or phone communication. After all, people can't see someone's body language or tone of voice in an email. I'm not trying to be harsh, patronizing, or insulting in this email. I'm honest and direct by nature, and I'm going to be that way in this email. By the way, I did a google search
 
I assume that you no longer want to go out with me. (If you do want to go out with me
 
Things that happened during our date include

-You played with your hair a lot. A woman playing with her hair is a common sign of flirtation. You can even do a google search on it. When a woman plays with her hair

-We had lots of eye contact during our date. On a per-minute basis
 
-You said, is inconclusive.
 
-We had a nice conversation over dinner. I don't think I'm being delusional in saying this statement.
 
In my opinion
 
Normally, I'm curious because I think our date went well and that there is a lot of potential for a serious relationship. Of course, it's difficult to predict what would happen, but I think there is a lot of potential for a serious relationship developing between us one day (or least there was before your non-response to my voicemail and text messages).

I think we should go out on a second date. In my opinion

Why am I writing you? Well, I gain utility from expressing my thoughts to you. In addition, even if you don't want to go out again, I would like to get feedback as to why you wouldn't want to go again. Normally, I wouldn't ask a woman for this type of feedback after a first date, but this is an exception given I think we have a lot of potential.

If you don't want to go again
In general

If you're not interested in going out again
We have a number of things in common. I’ll name a few things: First, the number one interest that I would want to have in common with a woman with whom I’m in a relationship is a liking of classical music. I wouldn’t be seriously involved with a woman if she didn’t like classical music. You said that you're planning to go the NY Philharmonic more often in the future. As I said, I go to the NY Philharmonic often. You're very busy. It would be very convenient for you to date me because we have the same interests. We already go to classical music performances by ourselves. If we go to classical music performances together, it wouldn't take any significant additional time on your part. According to the internet, you’re 33 or 32, so, at least from my point of view, but I’ll stop here.
I don’t understand why you apparently don’t want to go out with me again. We have numerous things in common. I assume that you find me physically attractive. If you didn’t find me physically attractive
Perhaps, I’ve done very well as an investment manager. I’ve made my parents several millions of dollars. That’s real money. That’s not monopoly money. In my opinion, if I make real money, it’s a real job. Donald Trump’s children work for his company. Do they have “real” jobs?  I think so. George Soros’s sons help manage their family investments. Do they have “real” jobs? I think so.
In addition
I’ve never been as disappointed and sad about having difficulty about getting a second date as I am with you. I've gone out with a lot of women in my life. (FYI

Am I sensitive person? Sure

I suggest that we continue to go out and see what happens. Needless to say, in my opinion, you would be making a big mistake, perhaps one of the biggest mistakes in your life.
If you don’t want to go out again, immature, passive aggressive, and cowardly. I spent time, effort, and money meeting you for dinner. Getting back to me in response to my messages would have been a reasonable thing for you to do. In addition, you arrived about 30 minutes late for our date. I’m sure you wouldn’t like it if a man showed up thirty minutes late for a first date with you.

If you're concerned that you will hurt my feelings by providing specific information about why you don't want to go with me again, at least I can understand the situation better. I might even learn something that is beneficial.

If you don't want to go out again, you shouldn't act that way toward a man and then not go out with him again. It’s bad to play with your hair so much and make so much eye contact if you’re not interested in going out with me again.
I have tried to write this email well, insulting, patronizing, etc. I'm disappointed, sad, etc. I would like to talk to you on the phone. I hope you will call me back at xxx-xxx-xxxx&gt; (if it’s inconvenient for you to talk on the phone when you read this email, you can let me know via email that you are willing to talk on the phone and I’ll call you). If you get my voicemail, I would appreciate it if you give me the courtesy of calling me and talking to me. Yes, etc.
 
Best
Mike

My name is Jamie, ([speaks_for_trees](http://www.reddit.com/user/Speaks_for_Trees)) left on Boxing Day, right after Christmas, to spend New Years in Times Square with some people he didn't know very well.  They spoke another language from him and apparently he felt alienated, and on the 30th he simply... walked away.

[And no one knows where he is.](https://www.facebook.com/groups/185598631539107/)

His last credit transactions were for a $20 Metro card on the 30th and a Burger King transaction we believe was on the 31st.  He had been staying at [640 W 139th St in Harlem](http://imgur.com/lSzRu), his wallet, his laptop, his trees, his iPod, and all his money.  He did NOT leave his ID, a jacket

We've put up fliers and we've talked to the shelters and the cops but I don't know what else to do.  He has a history of depression and he was in a strange place.  He was an engineer, and even all of reddit combined, all of the INTERNET put together, would not represent a hopeful percentage, but I don't know what to do.

[Here](http://www.wtvr.com/news/wtvr-richmond-man-22-missing-in-new-york-since-dec-26-20120105

Thank you for listening.  Thank you for anything.

UPDATE: We still havent found him.  Spent all day walking around between subway stations, Virginia this story will be showing up on the local news, Channel 6.  (But the rest of you can watch it [here](http://www.wtvr.com/videogallery/67187066/News/Missing-New-Kent-man))  Spoke with Detective Sanchez, who had been mostly busy today on a different case... we told him everything we know and a lot of things that are purely speculative, but he didnt have much to offer us yet.  Hopefully they'll make more progress tomorrow.

In the meantime

UPDATE

Every now and then I get orangered and click to see who replied to whatever comment, but because thinking about it hurts.

Sometimes I do respond, and I wasnt polite then.  Sorry, if you were one of those people.

The answer is no, friends, and total strangers about where he might be.  I've heard it suggested that he ran off to Canada, or that he's hiding in a Buddhist Temple somewhere (he wasn't Buddhist, or anything -ist other than athe), or even part of a Top Secret Government Sociological Experiment.  I dunno.  They all sound equally unreal, as does the reality of the situation.  I don't hurt constantly, on his birthday

I don't know where he is.  And honestly, it will be under his own power.  If that happens, and I hope it does, I'll post and... tell everyone.  Shoot, I'll personally message everyone that's ever asked.  But I'm not expecting that.  Because whether it feels real to me or not, his absence has become part of daily life for us.

Thank you for looking.  Thank you for your prayers.  I'm sorry I dont have good news.",,t5_2qhu2,1357700157.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/o3wnd/my_little_brother_has_been_lost_in_new_york_city/

&gt;I work with Professional Geologists, and so widely felt. See the attached diagram I made. The quake occurred on a fault that is oriented SW/NE (like most on the east coast) between an ancient granite/quartz formation (1 billion years ago), and a less ancient sedimentary formation (0.5 billion years ago).

&gt;Anyway... the less ancient formation shoots straight up to DC! This is why it was so intensely felt

I was on my way to work blasting ELO on my ipod (something like that to get me pumped up for work)  and noticed this girl looking at me. She had her headphones on and gave me a smile and I did the same. That’s when I decided I had to ask her out

At this point, and as “living thing” is blaring in my ears I get here attention, hand her my phone silently indicating she read it. She reads it, smiles, looks at me still smiling and yells – “I WOULD BUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND! SORRY! BUT I HAVE A BOYFRIEND!” and hands me my phone. I, in panic mode, scream back – “OK, muffled deep voice I can hear him say – “The kids got bualls! (laughing)”

This all happened from 3rd ave to 14th street and as we approached 14th

TL/DR - Tried to be discreet and ask girl out on train using text on phone  - both ended up yelling out responses cause we were both wearing headphones.

I recently visited New York City the other day. I live in Ithaca and the police departments compared to one another are very different. I was visiting a friend who lives in Morningside Heights. A predominate number of my NYC friends are caucasian. The night progresses, five of us (me and another female being the only black ones) all left the house and proceeded to make our way to another friends house. Someone mentions that they've forgotten their purse. The other two offer to accompany her back to the house to retrieve it. Myself and my friend (the only other african american) just decide to wait on the sidewalk for them to come back, we had only been walking for about five minutes and weren't far.

Very bad idea.

about 10 minutes after they leave, two cops exit their vehicle and approach us. I puff on my cigarette, TRYING to make is painfully obvious that its a cigarette. Two white officers than proceed to ask us for our ID's and what we were doing out so late.

My friend (who was very annoyed with the situation) states that she is a capable twenty year old adult woman who does not have to explain why she's out on her own accord at night. She also asked why they stopped us.

The officers ignored the question and focused their attention on me. They asked if I had any drugs on me or if I'd been doing anything I shouldn't of been doing. I told them no.

One of the officers made a remark after viewing my drivers license

The officer remarked: ""Are you sure this is your home address? Seems a little bit beyond your means."" At this point

At this point

The officers asked if them if they knew us to which they replied yes. He quickly let us go and left with his partner. I am absolutely positive I would've received some kind of ticket had my (white) friends not returned. I feel violated. It felt almost like how black people weren't allowed to be in public without a white man accompanying them. It felt dehumanizing and just pissed me off so much.

So reddit

EDIT: I'm sorry you think it's a troll thread. If I had more time I would definitely divulge the entire story with a lot more details but this is the gist. I should've just done an audioclip where I just ranted. I'm not planning on sending a fucking letter or trying to get on the news. It's simply a waste of time. To avoid these blatantly racially biased stop and frisk tatics, ya know?

Mom's funeral service is going to be tomorrow

Thanks.

***edit added and date fixed
OP here; 
first, I'm a little bit overwhelmed right now.
second, but it's definitely real. 
third, I admit. Mom didn't necessarily want anyone to attend the service or burial (and I really would advise against it - life can be sad without attending funerals of random strangers) - she just wanted to avoid having a funeral procession of one or two cars and instructed me to get people to just follow. I think my mom wasn't quite aware of how many caring friends and family members she has - the outpouring of sympathy and concern has been quite astounding so this may all be overkill. But part of me thinks it'd be nice to have a flash-procession (like a flash mob). Mom would be psyched.

So... take it for what you want. It's real.

A few people were already yelling ""call 911!"" I looked down and saw the male sprawled on the ground

As soon as I saw the blood, he had a fist sized gash in his forehead where his head hit the windshield of the taxi and all of his skin was torn up.

I looked around once more at everyone dumbfounded, knelt down beside him and applied it to his hemorrhaging wound, keeping pressure on it with my hands, while trying to keep his head slightly tilted up and braced so he didn't further hurt it. 

I was scared for him, but I didn't know exactly how bad it was.

Another lady knelt down to hold one of his hands trying to comfort him and asking him questions. I think he was a bike messenger.

Very quickly there was a crowd around us

I didn't have a very good grasp on how much time was passing

I didn't stick around to see what happened

I just wish I knew the outcome, and madness. 

But I thought by posting my story, find out what happened to this guy. The whole thing shook me up pretty good, it moved me. I was once hit by a car, laying on the ground helpless, in so much pain, in a different world. There was some kind of sick connection. I want to know.

We found Bagel, here is a timeline of the events that transpired from when she was lost Saturday night, to Sunday afternoon. 

**tl;dr: Lost our African Grey Parrot at 11pm on Saturday 6/22, and Reddit on Sunday afternoon!**

[Our last photo before she flew off

Please keep your birds on a harness whenever you take them out!!! We learned our lesson the hard way

**Bagel's Night Out**

It is Saturday evening and we are having a little get-together with friends. We are on the roof with Bagel

**11 PM:** Bagel gets startled as I prepare myself to go down the roof hatch to our 4th floor townhouse apartment. The combination of the glowing light and my sudden drop in preparation for descending the ladder is enough to spook her into flight. I am overcome with shock and fear as my poor baby is out on her own in Clinton Hill, she takes off into the night on a trajectory that takes her around the corner onto Fulton Street, where we lose sight of her darting away along the rooftops of Brooklyn. My heart drops as I jump down the hatch, bruising my knees as I scamper down to the street in the direction of her flight. 

**11PM - 2AM:** We canvas the immediate location with our friends who were over to enjoy a night of drinking and relaxation, as she would most likely take cover and wait out the evening until daylight. This does not stop us from scouring the streets shouting “Bagel!” and causing many people to stare and react negatively to our desperate calls.

[Drunk dude screaming ""BAGEL!!"" On the streets of Clinton Hill.](https://twitter.com/itsjonmackey/status/348662432366993408)

**2 AM:** We grab a Zipcar and head to our friend Jay's house, all we could think about is how little of a chance we had for recovering her, as she would certainly be lost in the night and our only hope would be getting as many people possible to be aware of our situation. As we headed into the city, all I could think about was how she was out there, alone in the night, and we were heading away from her. With no other options, we tried to reassure ourselves that she would likely stay put in the area.

**3:30 AM:** FedEx Kinko's can only read jpgs from a USB drive? We upload the image to Google Drive using the iPhone App

**4:30 AM:** After debating taking a two-hour nap we decide we cannot lose any time and start putting up posters. We run into a man on Clinton and Gates who tells us he heard a distinct bird calling out at two blocks over. As we start running east down Gates, until the man shows me a text typed out on his phone asking for money for baby formula. We realize he may just be leading us on for the reward money, although his description was fairly accurate.

**5:30 - 7 AM:** We continued scouring the neighborhood

**7:00AM:** Jenn returns home to make postings on Craigslist, patrolling up and down a radius of about 4 blocks in every direction from where we saw her fly. Being a young bird with flying experience limited to a Brooklyn-sized apartment, we knew if she was safe that she couldn't be far. Our biggest fear was that she would be hunkered down in a tree and would be impossible to find even if we were in the right backyard. That, and feral cats. At this time I saw a woman taking a photo of our flier. Turns out she is the Block President of the area, and she emailed a list of 100 or so people in the neighborhood for us with a description and photos of our flier. I start posting fliers up at local businesses which are beginning to open up.

**9 AM:** Sightings start coming in. We receive an email from a Craigslist responder saying that they purchased our bird on a bus from NY to VA. Bullshit! but we respond anyways, our strategy shifts to asking people we see leaving their apartments if we can go up on their roof or check out their backyard for our lost bird. People are generally sympathetic to our situation, and let us in. We spend sometime on the roof deck of 525 Clinton, which allows us a grand view of the surrounding blocks where we diagram the possible areas she may be in. Jenn believes that Bagel must've made a sweeping U-turn the way she was headed, my belief is that she made an S-curve after turning on Fulton. We mapp out all of the possible yards and private areas we need to get into and search.

**11 AM:** an email from ""Sbarnes"" spots Bagel flying over a school

&gt;""My husband might have seen her this morning heading from Waverly towards Washington Ave. over PS 11. It happened very quickly

We are ever so hopeful as the two sightings match up back to back. Bagel is flying east across Clinton Hill. Hopeful that she is alive

**12 PM:** Our friend Alex comes to join the search. Alex stayed with us last summer when he was interning at Bellevue

**2PM:** Jenn heads back to the apartment to reach out to bloggers and the media. I return to the area that bagel was last seen

**2:30PM:** Jenn receives a phone call about an orange bird in a backyard across the street from our apartment. 

""Hold on let me check again. You're right

Skeptical, there is a good chance that she may have flown away or will take off if she was to be approached by a stranger. I get to the building, a teenaged boy is sitting on the steps.

""Do you have her? Can I see her?""

He let's me through the garden level entrance, I'm greeted by several members of the family. 

""Look out the window! She's right there!""

I glance out the window to a backyard lush with foliage

""She's RIGHT THERE!""

I narrow my focal point. There she is. Sitting right outside the window. I was looking so hard my eyes went right behind her to the tree line. ""BAGEL!!"" I open the backdoor slowly as to not startle her

**REUNITED!**

Jenn's shows up with our Celltei bird carrier and the happiest face I have ever seen. We cannot believe our luck and bring Bagel back to our home for the meal of her lifetime and water from her favorite Saratoga Springs glass bottle. I head back down to our friends who found her

**Victory Lap**

I take my bike around the neighborhood, who shouted for joy so loud I could hear them from above when I relayed the news over the door buzzer. To the doorman on Clinton Ave that I biked by and fist pumped, to which he responded by jumping up with joy from his desk. To the birthday party at PS 11 who screamed with happiness when I told them the great news. To Eric, Phillip, Suzanne, Anna, Azita, Patricia, all banding together to help us find our poor lost bird. I've never felt such a great sense of community and a love for my wonderful neighbors. What a crazy adventure

Ok. This is a bit ranty. I know the obvious snarky response would be: Well move. Sure, I am a taxpaying citizen, and furthermore, there are people who *can't.* 

/rant

Edit 1: Holy fuck wow, through policy, shift market incentives that may make living in this town more sustainable. My point about produce: im not just whining over a bruised apple, it is that this apple cost me $2, and that a decent grocery store with a fair price point has no place to be in the city, it is an unsustainable business model.

The city needs to either drop the costs to landlords, electricity delivery. Or subsidize to say the least. They need to subsidize the rents of people who are *middle class* as well. Cities are beautiful things, cities keep our carbon footprint lower exponentially from those of the suburbs. Bastions of creativity.

But a lot of times it is a Banana Republic

Original message

Photo: *removed* 

Location: Webster Hall

I'm posting on behalf of a friend. Apparently the thief took a selfie, so there's no ""find my iphone"" and no geotags available.

She typed up a bunch of details

---
DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHO THIS MAN IS? This thief groped me and stole my phone while I was out in NYC last night. I didn’t realize until several minutes later. He texted my friend from my phone

When I checked my iCloud to recover my phone pictures, “Put that shit on Reddit, lol, I guarantee you’ll find him.” So please help me out!!

Here are some extra details for you all:

Incident details:

- Phone: iPhone 5.
- Location: Webster Hall
- My phone was in my back pocket. I felt a guy rub against my butt while he was walking by me


Tracking efforts:

- I had location tracking disabled on my phone

- Verizon tried but could not track the location from which the text message was sent.
- He sent me that single text message and stopped responding. He then turned the phone off
- Therefore

- I’ve suspended the phone and reported it to Verizon as stolen.

- The photo was taken this morning
- I’m going to the police today to turn in his picture.

I’ve personally never used reddit

So I wonder

Thanks in advance to the Redditors on here. I really appreciate any help!

I am not proud.

I bought some kombucha - with Chia seeds! - and it turned out to have gone bad. It exploded all over me when I opened it

 So I stood at the checkout, until I was making a fully-fledged scene, waving my kombucha in the air, comparing it with other bottles so they could note the color difference, and generally shouting and flailing until they reluctantly allowed me to exchange my precious $5 drink. 

So congratulations New York

Apparently, as a man from that car told me.  He also said the car smelled of decomposing flesh, not the usual subway stench.  She claimed that it was a doll, but clearly it was a dead child.  Someone pressed the emergency button and a policeman boarded the train at 1st ave.  She was escorted out with the dead baby in tow and I could see the allegedly dead baby, with toys all around it, flopping around in the carriage.

Okay.   I thought about this very carefully and I really started to worry about making 4300 people come into midtown manhattan on Sunday night, stranding everyone who comes to the shows and that the second show ends at midnight, sending people back home just as it's starting to pick up.

I know that a lot of people are excited to come and they are fine with taking the chance but I really don't want a pole to smash your face in because you saw some comedy.
So i asked the City Center (where the shows are supposed to happen) if we could find another date for tomorrow's shows and they gave me March 2nd.  The City Center, same everything.  If you can't come on that night, we will either do another show soon after that, or find another show for you in the area in the future.  Or you still have the option to get a full refund for your ticket.  If you already asked for a refund, we can reinstate your ticket if you want to go to one of those shows.

Listen.  I know that probably tomorrow it's going to be a starry clear night and the trains are going to be just gliding up and down the traks and a baby zebra is going to whinny as he trots by the City Center on a night that is going to break records for being placid and perfect for a night of comedy.  And I'm going to feel like an asshole.  And I know that some people had their plans set and are going to be pissed off at me.  I know.  but I also know that some of you are struggling with whether to come in or miss the show and this is the closest I can get to a solution.  You don't have to take a chance and you don't have to miss the show.  Just come see me in a few months.

If it's any consolation

Please email xxxlly@xxxx.com and tell us what you want to do

So that's that.  Cancelled.  Rescheduled.  Please forgive me.  Please be safe.

Your dumb friend

Louis CK

----------------------------------------
Learn the Lingo  
""Winged"" X bedroom - What, what they mean by this is that your apartment does not have a living room. A winged three bedroom is actually what in every other city/country is a two bedroom with a living space. Ah New York, the only civilized city I know where Lebensraum is a luxury, not a right.  

""Railroad style"" - Prepare to have your shame publicly broadcast to your roommates.  

""Boxed bedrooms"" - Shit ain't got closets. Which is great

""Small"" - I know I'm in for a doozy if they admit to the apartment being small. I clam up and get a feeling of GNAWING FEAR in my stomach as I a brace myself to be lead through what is nothing short of an urban habitrail. Throw in a wheel and some food pellets and I'll sign the lease today!  

""Steps away from XYZ"" - Hyperbole at its finest. Fucking Kobe Bryant steps, I am ""steps away"" from Manhattan. In Chinatown, I'm ""steps away from the East Village."" On avenue D, I'm ""steps away"" from a comfortable place where I don't have to worry about getting mugged and sexually assaulted.  

Avenue C - Probably closer to D.  

Between avenue B and C = Avenue C  

Perfect for students = perfect for broke people who can't afford anything but shit.  

""Exposed brick!"" - Do people actually like exposed brick? ""You know

Kitchen = living room with a stove in it.  

Living room = hallway with a stove in it.  

dishwasher = this is a typo. What they meant was gangbanging bedbugs.  

backyard = an outside-ish space full of garbage from previous tenants where you can contract west nile.  

""huuuuuuuuuge, roof partay!, sweeeeeet"" - empty words used by foreign Borat-lookalike brokers to lure naive young people into looking at shittacular apartments.  

Williamsburg = Bushwick.  

East Williamsburg = Really fucking Bushwick. Bushwack'd Bushwick.  

Tell me

2. Pets. You have four categories for pets.  
1\. Pets ok: this is like finding a fucking hundred dollar bill in a garbage bin of medical waste.  
2\. Pets not ok: at least they're honest. Dicks
3\. Pets on a case by case basis: BRINE SHRIMP and Tamagotchis ONLY.  

3. 5th floor walk-up: the stages of grief  
1\. Denial: Guys
2\. Anger: WTF DID THEY PUT IN ANOTHER FLIGHT OF STAIRS? AND DID THIS STAIRWAY GET NARROWER?  FUCK YOU
3\. Bargaining: Ok
4\. Depression: This usually entails me crying and eating Popeye's at the bottom of the stairs and debating on sleeping on the floor.  
5\. Acceptance: You were a bad idea. I regret you
6\. Teleportation while drunk: How did I get up here? I can't even fucking walk
  
4\. Let's Talk Brokers  

Broker Fee: at least they're being upfront about the fact they're trying to rob you.  
Negotiable fee: ""lolz i want money but i'm desperate so...let's work something out where you still feel violated and i can go get bottle service at da club
No fee: this apartment is shit. Take it and some waffle fries FO' FREE.  

""Oh
This was me a year ago--nubile, and that apartment was never available in the first place; it was only posted to lure you into going to their sketchy broker company, signing a contract (and signing away your legal right to rent any of the apartments you see at their real, un-inflated cost). Let it go and move on.  

""Oh
Brace for inevitable shit show. This includes apartments HUNDREDS of dollars outside your price range, apartments in the initial fuck phase of renovation, etc. All these can be yours and more for the low brokerage fee of one month's rent. Once you sign that stupid contract KILLSELF is the only option. Especially once you see the same apartment you looked at for 600 dollars lower than the broker advertised and you can't rent it because you're legally bound to a pile of shenanigans and horse apples.  

Almost every apartment being shown by brokers (fee or no fee) will be listed by a management company for significantly cheaper and less of a hassle. Not to say that management companies don't suck donkey balls too

If you see an apartment listed on CL that you like, then the apartment is available for cheaper. PROTIP: if you google-map the address ""Lower East Side at Manhattan Street"" your computer will implode and incinerate you immediately. Less retarded brokers will simply omit an address or just give you the neighborhood as in ""EAST VILLAGE GEM STEPS AWAY FROM --the moon, al gore, my bff jill, etc--""  

5\. You finally find a place you love and apply. You might get fucked over for no reason. A. Someone else might apply for the place who sucks less than you. B. Someone else might be willing to pay more than you. 4. The apartment was never available and they just wanted your application monies. Go home, repeat.  

6\. A memo to STUYTOWN

Putting a bookcase in the middle of a room does not make it two rooms. I am sick of seeing ONE BEDROOMS listed as THREE BEDROOMS.  

""lol, then put a door in that wall, and then pull out the copy of Milton's PARADISE LOST in the bookcase, thus activating the secret door. Take that path, race up to the observatory, spin the sundial and pass into the room of the golden idols. Once there, push down on their faces to release the doors

Assemble the statue there and you may be headed for the torch room. If the elevator is up, you may have a chance to sit upon the throne of the Pretender. If the correct door is unlocked, you'll be able to crawl into pit of despair and finally make you way through the cave of size, back to the temple gate.  

The choices are yours and yours alone.  
Good luck!""",,t5_2qhu2,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nyc/comments/iabpt/solid_advice_from_a_girl_whos_starting_the/

Well it wasn't just an entrance

Beyond that, wanting to see a simple memorial, and I had to take off my jacket, belt, jewelry, empty my pockets and walk through a metal detector. I have a Leatherman multi-tool that I keep with me regularly, which naturally caused concern. I was pulled aside by security who told me to take it out of my jacket so they could inspect it, to which the guard said

Another German couple wasn't so lucky. They didn't seem to speak very good English and were confused about what was going on. They had a little backpack thing, you can't go in!"" The German man didn't really understand, he thought they were taking his bag, so there was a little grappling match.

It used to be pretty easy to do this, if you want to put in an amount that happens to come to an exact even multiple of $2.25, you're looking at the LCD of 107 and 225, which is more money than I ever hope to pay to the MTA in my lifetime.  (Note also that you can only put money into the machine in multiples of $0.05.)

Luckily, you get $42.7465, which is rounded up to **$42.75**, good for _exactly_ nineteen rides.

I wrote a program to pump out these numbers; see below for the full list of MetroCard inputs (up to $100) that results in a sum evenly divisible by $2.25.

I am a NYCT Subway Conductor (yes, and I CONSTANTLY get cited on here for saying something that isn't even true when you read it in the wrong context.

When it comes to injured, and it IS the code they use for that, but ""police investigation"" is ALSO the code used for a fight on the train, a fugitive who ran into a subway station, and many other, you know, POLICE INVESTIGATIONS. Just because you hear ""this station is closed due to a police investigation"" it does NOT automatically mean that somebody is under a train. I never said that ""police investigation"" ONLY means person under train.....

As for ""sick customer"", or someone who dropped dead on the train (you can only be pronounced dead by a medical professional, so an seemingly unconscious/dead customer is treated as an alive person needing medical attention by the train crew). Either way, if that customer is on the train, the train will be held until EMS (or in some cases during morning rush hour, impatient and in-compassionate customers) can remove that customer from the train. So when you hear ""this train is being held due to a sick passenger requiring medical assistance"" don't just to the conclusion that this sick customer HAS to be dead, because I never said that ""sick customer"" ONLY refers to DEAD customers.

1351445573.0,1285ps,Preparation for Hurricane Sandy,Supra104,213,32,128,"Based on initial indications

""By failing to prepare you are preparing to fail.""— Benjamin Franklin

**Facts about Irene:**

* Caused $15 billion dollars in damage
* Killed 47 people in the USA

**Facts about Sandy:** 

* Sandy's Current death toll is at 48

* On Saturday
 
* Upon landfall, Sandy will still be strengthening. 
 
* As a result of Sandy’s tremendous size and strength
 
**Preparation:**

* Stay indoors during the hurricane and away from windows and glass doors
 
* Keep all your electronics charged and plugged in. (cell phones, tablet ..etc) 
 
* Turn down the temperature on your freezer and refrigerator as low as possible. This will buy you more time in the event of a power loss. 24 to 48 hours before will cool the food. Avoid opening them whenever possible. If you are evacuating
 
* Download an application to your smartphone that can notify people where you are
 
* If you have a generator
 
* Keep away from loose or dangling power lines and report them immediately to the power company.
 
* Make sure your car has fuel.
 
* Stay off roads as much as possible
 
* Copies of your important documents in a waterproof and portable container (insurance cards
 
* A list of medications you take

* Doctors’ names and phone numbers
 
* Use flashlights instead of candles
 
* Whistle
 
* It may sound strange, and take a shower. Why? Because if you lose power, having as much clean as possible will make a big difference.
 
* Avoid using the phone except for serious emergencies.
 
* Know your surroundings and whether your home is in a flood prone area. 

* Determine where you would go — and how you would get there — if you were 
ordered to evacuate
 
* Listen to the radio or TV for information
 
* Secure your home
 
* Huge items must even be secured in big storms. An engine block was found 40 or 50 feet up in a pine tree in the Homestead area after Andrew. Don't think that something is too big to be moved by the wind.
 
* Have enough food that you can eat without cooking (because you may lose power) for 4-5 days suggested items including: canned meats, canned juice, peanut butter, jelly, salt-free crackers, energy/protein bars, trail mix/nuts, cookies or other comfort food.
 
* Make extra ice
 
* Have enough water for 4-5 days
 
* Ensure a supply of water for sanitary purpose such as cleaning and flushing toilets. Fill the bathtub and other larger containers with water
 
* Know power safety - avoid downed lines
 
* Know food safety - what is good and for how long.
 
* Water treatment - whether water needs to be boiled or not.
 
* Avoid drinking or preparing food with tap water until you are sure it's not contaminated.
 
* Check refrigerated food for spoilage. If in doubt
 
* Have a plan. Discuss possible hazards and procedures with your family

* Have extra cash on hand

* Regardless of whether or not you are in an evacuation zone

**If evacuating

* Before you evacuate
* Leave a note to say where you are going.
* Unplug small appliances and electronics before you leave.
* Checkbooks
* Driver's license
* Credit card information
* Birth certificates
* Social Security cards
* Child care

I hope this helps

I am currently on disability and will be attending Brooklyn College in January to work on a Computer Science degree.

In about three weeks I will be officially homeless. Although I am looking for a job I can take on while on disability I have been unable to save enough money for a deposit for an apartment for myself and my daughter.

I don't know if there is anyone out there that has connections that might be able to help get into a place that might be flexible on deposit at least until I can either start a new job or I will have a living allowance once I start back to school in January that I will happily cough up to anyone. 

I also may be able to come up with the deposit immediately with the help of HRA I just need someone that is willing to work with me. HRA needs documentation from the landlord of what I would need to move into a place and when i even mention this when looking for a place it's suddenly not available.

*I'm Executive Chef of a fine dining restaurant in nyc

Everyone with any restaurant experience knows that health inspections are extremely stressful.  During inspection

Last summer NYC changed its system from what was essentially pass/fail to a letter grade system: 0-13 points for an A, requiring monthly re-inspections until the point total falls below 28 or the restaurant is shut down by the city.  The point system, inspection procedure or regulations didn't change at all...what changed was the letter grading and the added rule that the it had to be posted ""where they can easily be seen by
people passing by.""

And it's a critical change at that.  For every restaurant in the city to be required to post a [giant letter grade](http://i.imgur.com/7kKRp.jpg) from the department of health on the front door is no joke.  I've always run a very clean kitchen...for the benefit of sanitation and of staff discipline.  Even I was fucking scared as hell.  

Why soil ourselves so badly?  

Well, someone else is doing the same.  So, for taco restaurants the competition went from all *restaurants serving tacos* to *restaurants serving tacos that have an ""A"" hanging on their door*.  The other places are irrelevant and cannot compete to make real money and/or survive until they achieve the ""A"".

New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene knows this and it is in fact the point of it all.  They’re working to make restaurants take their inspections  even more seriously or risk going out of business.   Which sounds great to just about everyone too.  But there are a couple of major problems here…

**1) The outcome of health inspections are often unpredictable and depend on a number of uncontrollable factors.**

This. Is. Fact. Ever been to the DMV?  Or the post office?  Or the police station?  I'm not trying say people in civil service are all terrible, helpful with addressing your concerns.  The next time you get someone who couldn't care less about you and doesn't mind letting you know it.  Or sometimes you get pulled over for speeding and the officer lets you go with a warning.  Other times he/she gives you the ticket while looking for reasons for more, giving you a condescending lecture the whole time.  Not sure why but people in civil service seem to be the most inconsistent workforce anywhere.  Maybe it's the hiring procedure, or the candidates they receive, or the nature of the job and their salaries?  Or maybe they're just as inconsistent as any other group, it's just that we expect them to be otherwise.

Well, but use common sense and reason to guide their process making them fair.  Some of them seem to be out to find every single violation or hint of one in an effort to inflict the most damage on your business during their visit.  Some of them don't really care about any of it and breeze through the inspection.  I guess they're human, and the worst of them are technically abiding by the rules stated.  So is the cop that adds on a ticket for not using the turn signal while pulling over.  Just saying that the inspector you draw is a huge factor that you have no control over.

Also, customers, garbage, chemicals, fire, water and anything else you can think of.  A restaurant is like a living being and to judge it based on a snapshot taken at a random moment is a problem itself.  Again, we got an ""A"" on our inspection, and of course we deal with them quickly to get everything soignee again. But should you be having a bad day and the inspector arrives

**2) People have no fucking clue what an A

Decisions that affect small businesses.  Small businesses that each employ anywhere from a handful to hundreds of people.  It's not hard to predict a diner's thought process in relation to health department letter grades.

**I'm only going to restaurants with an A!**

*Um

**I don't care!  A's are better than B's!  Everyone knows that from years and years of school!!  Why would I go somewhere that's not as good?**

And that diner is right.  There's no reason for anyone to go to any restaurant without that **A**.  On top of that, and proceeds to think about rat droppings, cockroaches, fight club, etc and runs away disgusted.

But do you know what makes a **B**?  Well we said already it's 14 points.  Points come from violations.  Some examples (each violation's point value has a range

Side towel left on counter top - **5 to 7 points**

Refrigerator above 41°F (even 1°) - **7 to 10 points**

Refrigerator missing thermometer - **2 to 5 points**

Any fly (*food and/or non-food areas*) - **5 to 8 points (28 if it's really messed up like Temple of Doom style I guess)**

Aaaaand we're at around 20 points!  Don't forget that these violations' points sometimes stack too. So for instance

The point is that the letter grade **doesn't actually mean anything close to what is being perceived.**  How about a 13 point **A** vs a 14 point **B**?  Or two **B**s but one had rotten meat on the hot line and the other got 6 points because a line cook was drinking a cup of water in the kitchen? (Yes

Here's [Grace Green on Huff Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/19/city-inspections-reveal-n_n_810872.html) with a typical clueless blog post.  She gleefully says that Le Cirque and Gramercy Tavern (large, and we don't know how many violations.  Again, you don't know because you can't tell because the letter grade doesn't have that information.  This is someone writing an article on the subject and still has no idea how the system works and what the grades mean.   The hilarious thing is that they don't mean anything until you investigate the violations.  (You can find full details on each restaurant's inspection [online](http://a816-restaurantinspection.nyc.gov/RestaurantInspection/SearchBrowse.do) but I seriously doubt anyone is going to bother to look past the letter grade)

And so these are the grades that everyone in the city are now judging us on.  And it's a shame.  I'm all for strict health and safety standards for diners and employees everywhere.  But the DHMH didn't think this through before implementation.  It's made slipping on a health code a potential death blow to an entire business and the income of its employees.  

I take great pride in the work I do, but that's a good thing.  If you're running a restaurant, no matter who you are or where you work...in this town you're battling guys like Mario Batali, Daniel Boulud, Eric Ripert, Nobu, and Gordon Ramsey every single night to get people into your seats.  The criteria should be the product we work to produce
 
But as it is


tl;dr Health inspection letter grades are too vague and arbitrary to have the so large an impact on a restaurant's ability to compete and survive.

Last night, I show up in a suit and joke that I'll be the best dressed and all of you fuckfaces all show up in shirts and ties.

Bullshit. A few commenters called it out on his post but they got downvoted to oblivion. I'll chalk that up to white guilt and people not wanting to seem on the wrong side of a race argument. Well

I'm black. I grew up in Manhattan and Brooklyn and I've dealt with my fair share of shit. I also have a lot of police officer friends both white and black

That said, they'd write you up on some jaywalking charge and have you in a jail cell, not run off into the night when they see your superhero white friends coming back.

Tonight I'm hosting Saturday Night Live

I've been working here all week with the cast, and with Lorne Michaels. Such a great and talented group of people.  

And here we are in the middle of New York City, so much difficulty and trauma, which everyone here is still dealing with every day.   

Last night we shot some pre-tape segments in greenwich Village

Its pretty impossible to describe walking through these city streets in total darkness.  It can't even be called a trip through time, gas lamps, candlelight, kerosene.  But this was pitch black, street after street, corner round corner. And for me, the village being the very place that made me into a comedian and a man, in a way

This is how a lot of the city is still.  I know people in queens, new jersey, all over, are not normal yet.  And not normal is hard. 

And here at 30 rock

In about 5 hours we'll be going on the air.   I'll do a monologue.  And we'll show you some sketches that we wrote and try to make you laugh.   I'm gonna look really dumb in some of this stuff.  But I don't care. Its awfully worth it. And I'm really excited. 

Anyway.  I just wanted to let you know.  If you watch the show tonight

Thanks. 

Louis C.K. 

Live.  From new york.  Its saturday night.

finding real estate is hard, that also means that people will get screwed over, and you cant screw people over when it comes to the place where they will live and sign a lease locking them in to living at the same place, sometimes for up to two or even sometimes 3 years. seeing people get screwed over angers me a lot, so i want to help out and maybe shed some light about how things go down in the real estate world.

I studied it in school and used to be pretty good. I've lost a lot of my skill from having not played in ages.

This morning

So, when I see a figure standing over me. Usually, that means that someone is fishing in the pockets for some change or a single dollar bill. I was concentrated on the fret board so I didn't look up immediately. Generally, I make a point to look at people and smile. However, this particular part of the song was tricky so I had to keep my eyes on my fingers. 

When I could

I stopped playing.

**Me:** *""Good morning

**Officer:** *""What are you doing?""*

**Me:** *""You're lookin' at it. I'm not sure what else to say

**Officer:** *""I mean

**Me:** ""*Practicing and giving the nice people some music to listen to during their commute... and making a little money

**Officer:** ""*I mean

**Me:** ""*No

**Officer:** ""*You're not homeless?*"" 

**Me:** ""*No

**Officer:** ""*And you live right upstairs

**Me:** ""*Yes

**Officer:** ""*Can I see some ID

**Me:** ""*Absolutely.*""

(I hand him my ID)

**Officer:** ""*Have you ever been arrested before?*""

**Me:** ""*No

**Officer:** ""*Totally clean?*""

**Me:** ""*Yes

**Me:** ""*Thank you

Studios Bottom out at $1500-$1600. LES, FiDi, UWS, UES are the cheapest places (in no particular order). If you get a place for under $1,600 and there is a chalk outline on the floor, it's probably still a good deal. 

The 1 Bedroom bottom is about 2k. 

A 2 bedroom bottoms at like $2200ish. They will all be either convertible (put the wall up yourself)

The cheapest 3 Bedroom's I've seen have been $3


If you want to figure out where you want to live

Should probably add that I didn't include Harlem in the mix

I hope this gives everyone a better idea of what is actually going on in terms of rents. Also
