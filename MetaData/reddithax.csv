    .option.add.active {
	    cursor: default;
	    position: fixed;
	    top: 0;
	    left: 0;
	    width: 100%;
	    height: 100%;

	    z-index: 1000;
    }

    /* non-clickable add to frontpage button
       to keep users thinking that they are still unsubscribed */

This does the opposite; it makes everyone unsubscribe (someone might want to use this if they infiltrate a subreddit by becoming a mod and want to remove subscribers) and fools users into thinking they are still subscribed with that fake subscribe button from the last example:

    /* remove from frontpage clickjacking */

	    padding: 0;
	    font-size: 0;
	    z-index: 1000;
    }

    /* non-clickable remove from frontpage button to keep users thinking
       that they are still subscribed */

    .option.add.active {
	    display: none;
    }

    .fancy-toggle-button {
	    cursor: pointer;
    }

Follow these steps:

1. Back up your subreddit sidebar and CSS.
2. Edit your subreddit settings. Change the page title to ""Subreddit Unavailable"" and change the sidebar text to [this](https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/a4c3667690e85dd18876/raw/0bcf9514f4cae0ec1001fde717b1d3d6d4916c10/gistfile1.txt). Also
3. Upload [this image](http://i.imgur.com/6szrjUL.png) to your stylesheet. Call it ""alien"".
4. Replace your CSS with [this](https://gist.github.com/SirCmpwn/235cc8899c01d4ef0069/raw/565ec0edb505cc947968c06fe0d779da20dfe4ef/gistfile1.txt).

It worked because certain pages from reddit can still be accessed when they are under a subreddit path (eg. [/r/reddithax/help/](/r/reddithax/help/) ) and the CSS from that subreddit is included.

The admins have now fixed it so that preference pages under a subreddit redirect to the main preference page.

###See the stylesheet links for the code.###

...[Putting it all together](http://www.reddit.com/r/stunts/)

How it works:

1. Make a ':before' or ':after' pseudo-element using the logout button
2. Make another :before/after pseudo-element using a non-clickable element and position it so it covers the first one.
3. Check the first character of the hidden modhash input element

Step three is repeated 36 times
This means you can have up to 36 random images/text strings.

Step two is purely to stop the pseudo-element being clickable. As it's an extension of the logout button normally you'd be able to click it. This isn't desirable.

In theory you could have almost unlimited images/strings by comparing more than just the first character of the modhash. Doing this would give you up to 50^36 random images

The last example /r/stunts adds both a :before and :after pseudo element to the logout button, giving us a random images and text on the same page which are unrelated to each other.

The header on the page also has a background image,False,,t5_2qtkl,True,,,t3_pfj5f

The basic idea is that [my ROBOT9000 user](/user/ROBOT9000) would be added as moderator to a subreddit, but the level also decays exponentially over time.

The devil's in the details:

* How to penalize? A single downvote doesn't seem like a sufficient penalty. Removal hides the comment
* Should users be notified of being penalized?
* Should ""duplication"" mean per-page
* On a more technical note

Here's my initial proposal:

* A first-level offense gets a downvote.
* A second-level offense gets a downvote and a PM.
* A third-level offense gets a removal.
* A fourth-level offense (or higher) gets a temporary ban of increasing length.

Alternatively:

* As a first offense
* Ban times double per offense

+  **Compact links and comments** to utilize space better
+  Readability improvements.

Whoa, click /r/trueclop (NSFW) (this is for education only dammit) and see the differences between the normal sub and the enhanced sub (link in header changes both ways). Leaving it unflipped back will be fine for most of reddit, but you should take out that 'pa' and change it to 'www' so you don't end up somewhere you never knew existed in a sub you may frequent.

Wiki pages or Contact pages anyone? Click /r/MLPhelp (SFW

    html:lang(pa) .sitetable.linklisting
    html:lang(pa) .side h3:nth-of-type(3) {top:240px}
    etc for each 'nth type' so they get spaced out.

You could also do this with paragraphs to make a wiki page. Furthermore, but that'll take a bit more to explain.

As many of you know, that is aimed at cleaning up the front page of the once meme-and-screenshot-riddled subreddit.

Last night I took the liberty of modifying some of that code to include a warning on several unoriginal, as well as implicitly encouraging our users to downvote such submissions. However, if the submissions are upvoted anyway, they will not be removed, because they technically violate no rule.

        font-size: 0;
        overflow: hidden
    }


And then I replaced the text and styled it - this area still needs me to go back and optimize now that it's working


    /*hot tab*/
    ul.tabmenu &gt; li a[href=""http://www.reddit.com/r/lipogram/""]:after {
        content: ""what's hotâ€½"";
        color: #E4F0FB;
        font-size: x-small;
        border-bottom: 1px solid #5f99cf
    }

The border is added again just to hide the tops of the original text because they peek over the original bottom border.

Finally, and hide that border. 

    /*selected tab fix*/
    ul.tabmenu &gt; li.selected a {
        border-bottom: 4px solid #fff;
        overflow: hidden;
        color: #fff
    }
    ul.tabmenu &gt; li.selected a:after {
        color: #ff4500;
        border-bottom: 0px
    }


The tabs I replaced were: hot, top, saved, comments, and related.

1271994554.0,buxnm,Forcing text submissions,Sephr,12,3,6,"I cooked up some CSS to force text submissions. Of course it won't work if a user has custom styles disabled

You most likely will want to combine it with the following CSS I also made to change the ""submit a **link**"" text and description.

    .sidebox.submit .subtitle {
        display: none;
    }

    .sidebox.submit .morelink a {
        position: absolute;
        top: 0;
        font-size: 0; /* reddit should allow color: transparent; but it doesn't */
    }

    .sidebox.submit .morelink:before {
        display: block;
        clear: none;
        content: ""{text to replace 'submit a link' with}"";
        text-align: center;
        color: #369;
    }

    .sidebox.submit .morelink:hover:before {
        color: white;
    }

    .sidebox.submit .spacer:after {
        display: block;
        content: ""{text to replace 'submit a link' description with}"";
        color: dimgray;

        margin-left: 10px;
    }

    .sidebox.submit .spacer {
        cursor: text;
    }

**Edit:** Here's some CSS to force link submissions:

    .formtabs-content {

Just doing a quick little write up of how they work in case you folks want something similar for your subreddit.

A new Pokemon game is coming out

1\. Create link flair template for spoilers that submitters can use.

2\. CSS:

    /*Spoilers*/
    .post-submitter .entry .flairselectbtn:before {
        content: ""Click here to mark spoilers: "";
        color: #f00;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title {
        color: #fff !important;
        background-color: #fff;
        display: inline-block;
        height: 21px;
        border: 1px solid #000;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title:hover {
        color: blue !important;
    }
    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title:visited:hover {
        color: #551A8B !important;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler a.title:before
        background: #FFF;
        color: #000;
        content: ""Spoiler"";
        display: inline-block;
        height: 19px;
        padding: 0 5px;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler .thumbnail img {
        display: none;
    }

    .listing-page .linkflair-spoiler .thumbnail {
        display: block;
        width: 70px;
        height: 54px;
        background: url(%%spoiler%%) no-repeat;
    }

    .linkflair-xyspoiler .linkflairlabel {
        display: none;
    }

    .flairselector .linkflair-spoiler a.title:before {
        padding: 0;
        height: auto !important;
        top: 0;
    }

    .flairselector .linkflair-spoiler a.title {
        background-color: #fff;
        color: #000 !important;
    }

    .linkflairlabel { display: none; }
    .flairselector .linkflairlabel { display: block !important; margin: 0 auto; text-align: center; }
    .flairselector .title { display: none !important; }

The CSS is a bit longer than I thought it would be

* Adds ""Click here to mark spoilers"" to posts you've submitted to encourage users to mark them
* Restyle the actual link to make it white on white until you hover
* Restyle the flair to remove the flair text
* Restyle the flair selector to make the selection easier on the eyes
* Add ""Spoiler"" :before the links
* Replace thumbnail with spoiler thumbnail

Additionally, and distribute them to other moderators, who can then easily apply those themes to their subreddits.

    .expando-button { display: inline !important }

Neater way....

    .compressed .expando-button {
    	display: inline !important;
    	background: none !important;
    	height: 13px !important;
    	width: 23px !important;

It's actually pretty simple to setup and very easy to update:

**Step 1**: Add this CSS to your subreddit's stylesheet.

    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol li a {
        border: 1px solid #fff;
        background-color: #7575CC;
        padding: 2px 6px 2px;
        color: #fff;
        text-decoration: none;
        font-weight: bold;
        font-size: small;
    }
    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol li a:hover {
        border-color: #000000;
        background-color: #8A8A33;
    }
    .titlebox form {
        position: static;
    }
    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol {
        list-style: none;
        position: absolute;
        top: 55px;
        left: 209px;
        z-index: 200;
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        display: table;
    }
    .titlebox .usertext-body .md ol li {
        display: inline;
        margin: 0 3px;
    }

Based on the size of your subreddit's icon

**Step 2**: Setup an ordered list in your sidebar (i.e.

    1.  upcoming meetups:
    1.  [board games 1/11](http://redd.it/ezplv ""Fantasy Flight Event Center at 6:00 PM"")
    1.  [bowling 1/13](http://redd.it/eza7z ""It's at EP Brunswick Bowl
    1.  [d&amp;d night 1/13](http://redd.it/ezibq ""D&amp;D or Bowling?"")
    1.  [bar meetup 1/14](http://redd.it/exknx ""New thread not posted yet"")
    1.  [coffee meetup 1/16](http://redd.it/eyl3b ""New thread not posted yet"")
    1.  [risk tourney 1/23](http://redd.it/ez22s ""Club Underground in NE

The CSS moves these items from the sidebar to the top of the page.  Any items you add will automatically be appended to the top

Press the bookmarklet while on the comments page of a story in a subreddit you moderate and a star will be added before it.

## Technical stuff:

The bookmarklet loads an external script because the jQuery callbacks weren't firing with all the code in the bookmarklet. There may be problems with multiple people editing the css concurrently (if two people try to add a star at the same time

* the link flair selector

So reddit has a hard limit of 350 flair templates, so that obviously wouldn't do.

Solution: A bot that sets user flair based on private messages.

### Design

* A bot that responds to private messages with ""Set flair"" as the subject and a number as the body. It sets the sender's flair to that flair number.
* A nice page for people to click on pokemon to get to the reddit ""compose message"" form and send the request.

Here's how I did it:

### CSS

The easiest step was to set up the flair styles. The stylesheet is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/about/stylesheet/). Here's the generic flair styles:

    .flair
        background: url(%%masternew%%) transparent no-repeat;
        border: 0px;
        vertical-align: middle;
        display: inline-block;
    }

The `.wiki-page a[href^=""/message""]` was added for the clickable flair listing. Each link looks like this: `/message/compose/?to=pokemon-flair&amp;subject=Set+flair&amp;message=&lt;pokemon number&gt;`

In the selectors for each flair

### Generating Markdown

I didn't really want to manually type up the table that appears on the wiki page. [Here's the code I whipped up to do it for me](https://gist.github.com/70ea01bdf611e4d35999).

### The Bot

The actual bot takes advantage of my [RedditSharp](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/RedditSharp) library for working with Reddit. The bot's code is [here](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PokemonFlairBot). We can't send private messages without answering a capcha (unless you have enough karma), it just sets their flair to missingno. [Here's all the code that handles message parsing and setting flair](https://github.com/SirCmpwn/PokemonFlairBot/blob/master/PokemonFlairBot/Program.cs#L49).

### Notes

* I know the markdown generation could have been in python or something
* `Thread.Sleep(60000 * 5)` is probably not the best way to time things in 5 minute intervals
* The bot also handles removing posts on blacklisted domains

I asked earlier on this subreddit for an Xmas theme a while back and changed my mind in between to make a winter theme. Becauyse I'm not selfish I'll share my [spoils](www.reddit.com/r/fredericton). Basically what I did was change the header for a christmas-y image and then changed the mail box/karma box for a light blue

Here's the code:  

    /* Christmas Theme ############### */

    /* Header Image */
    #header {
        border-bottom: 1px solid white;
        position: relative;
        background-color: transparent;
        background-image: url(%%winter%%);
        z-index: 99
        }

    /* bar with karma and mail */
    #header-bottom-right {
        background-color: #C2E0FF !important;
        color: black !important;
        border: black !important;
        }

    div#userbarToggle {
        background-color: white !important;
        border:none
        }

    #header-bottom-right a
        color: black !important

/r/Badkarma exists to root these jerks out

What I was thinking is a common bot. If a special statement is made in a /r/badkarma thread by a designated poster there verifying the person in question as a scammer, efficient prospect.

This bot would have three functions:

1. Trawling /r/badkarma for some sort of designated item

2. Taking the user mentioned in brackets from the title and added them to the ban list of any subreddit it moderates 

3. Using the message mods link of that subreddit to notify the moderators why that person was banned

How might one go about coding this? I presume an application of some sort will need to periodically grab the users online value and save it to a database and then use that information to render a graph which must then be hosted online to be displayed either in a sidebar or on an external site.

I'm a complete noob when it comes to implementing this kind of thing

I've done some google-fu and found a fair bit that may help in my quest. This includes [bf3stats api](http://bf3stats.com/api) which looks like it may have to be a middleman for me as dealing with battlelog's api direct looks and sounds like a nightmare. 
Also [this](http://forum.p-stats.com/threads/610-Sig-coding-Collection-of-useful-functions) from their forums seems like a treasure trove of code for what I'm thinking of doing.

As it is the picture is just there as a background set not to repeat high up on .side.

If you go to [/r/fuckingbored](http://www.reddit.com/r/fuckingbored) where i'm a mod and have been playing around with it all you can see my progress.

I couldn't figure out how to actually get it to float *in* the 'before' code of the .side though, please excuse the dumb tags I added to my friends' names; give me a small amount of control and I will abuse it to my most immature limits.

     /*~~~~~~~Getting rid of the default subreddit thumbnail~~~~~~~~~~*/

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href\^=""http://www.reddit.com/""] img
     {
          display:none;
     }

Explanation:

    a.thumbnail.loggedin img

selects the thumbnail image for a specific subreddit (although it only works for users that are logged in

     [href^=""http://www.reddit.com""]

is an attribute selector that selects only links that begin with Reddit.com.

On a side note

     [href*=""reddit""] 

would select links that have the case-sensitive phrase ""reddit"" somewhere inside the link. I am going to use this selector in the rest of my code.

And also

[href=""http://www.reddit.com""] 

is a selector that would select links that are *exactly* http://www.reddit.com/

These selectors are case sensitive, so this trick may not work with older browsers.

---

Now to replace the thumbnail with a creation of my own:

      /*~~~~~~~Shit Reddit Says~~~~~~~*/

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""r/ShitRedditSays""]:before
      a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""]:before
      {
           content:""Shit Reddit Says"";
     }

      a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""r/ShitRedditSays""]
      a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""]
     {
     color:#550000;
     font-size:10px;
     font-weight:900;
     text-align:center;
     background-image:none;
     vertical-align:middle;
     text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #AA8888;
      }

Explanation:

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""ShitRedditSays""]:before
     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""]:before

This selects the box that contains the subreddit thumbnail image, ""SHITREDDITSAYS"", or ""Shitredditsays"". 

This selector is case sensitive

I also needed to separate each individual selector with a comma. I also have to insert the selector "":before"" after each individual selector so that the ""content"" property will work properly on all of them.

       { content:""Shit Reddit Says"";}

This inserts the words ""Shit Reddit Says"" into that box that *used to* contain the thumbnail image. The content property only words on selectors that are ended with the phrase "":before"".

     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""r/ShitRedditSays""]
     a.thumbnail.loggedin[href*=""shitredditsays""]
     {
     color:#550000;
     font-size:10px;
     font-weight:900;
     text-align:center;
     background-image:none;
     vertical-align:middle;
     text-shadow:4px 4px 4px #AA8888;
     }

This selects the same exact box all over again

---

Now, SRSMicroaggressions, and SRSDiscussion, provided that the previous code successfully eliminates the default subreddit thumbnail.

I've got the default CSS sheet all formatted but I'm having trouble in the 6k lines finding the styles for that menu. I'm also not exactly sure how I should go about placing that image there. The alien was easy as they have that widget that does that for you now but I don't want to mess that up. I could certainly add it to the header background image. Then it would just be a matter of styling that link so that it doesn't display any text and moving it's hit box up

Then again that may screw up the rest of the menu items. And since I can't find them I can't be sure how they are styled.

Here is the link posted to the ""Ideas For The Admins"" subreddit

Reddit is an awesome site, I have a big problem with proposing my design. In order for this to be taken seriously, the design needs to be functional in an example subreddit. 

This is where one of you guys come in. I need someone who is up for the job of implementing this design into a functional subreddit that *may* push the envelope in terms of creative scripting. However this is a great opportunity for one of you to show off your skills to the reddit team, and I rely on you to be cooperative and collaborative with me while we work out the kinks, despite how many bumps in the road we hit. I'll do my very best to make your job easier, and I hope you will be able to return the favor.

**On the flip side of things** I would also like to hear constructive criticism regarding the design. What would you change or add to it to enhance the user-experience and user-friendliness? Comments like ""ugly"" or ""shit design"" will be ignored

Thanks very much!

It works really well in Firefox

Main problems I've noticed in Chrome:

* Inconsistent placement of hover elements vs non-hover. This can lead to rapid back-and-forth switching between the two styles when the cursor is in the right spot.
* Indentation for new paragraphs goes way too far left in Chrome

Problem in all browsers:

* Can't highlight text in answers to copy. Instead

1316033810.0,kfrdl,Creating a two Division Standings Tables and cutting the sidebar length in half.,blind__man,1,0,0,"Prerequisite: You should know that this doesn't cut the wordcount of your sidebar in half

I had originally created a simple table for a subreddit to display the Records and the conference records of all the teams in their conference.  It seemed like enough for them but I wanted more.  Enough of me being egotistical.

This is a bit difficult to understand and the way I explain it may make it worse but I will try my best.  Some people who really know CSS may scoff at what I describe but I figured I'd share with all the sports people out there.

There are two things in particular you will need to understand:

* Different stylesheets on a subreddit (using body:lang(as))

* The nth-child() specification

Using body:lang(as) will create a ""separate"" stylesheet for your subreddit but contain it in the same place as the custom one Reddit allows you to edit.  **It will also inherit whatever values given by the original custom stylesheet** (aka anything not preceded by body:lang(as)).  This is important because if you give something the attribute `display:none` in the stylesheet you must reset it

The nth-child() attachment to the attribute allows you to pick the object you want but it may be a little hard to understand as it was a little difficult to figure out for myself when it started getting finicky with me.  Odd children are either `nth-child(odd)` or `nth-child(2n+1)` and even children are either `nth-child(even)` or `nth-child(odd)`.

Here is what I put in.  I know the explanation wasn't especially sufficient but I got through this with pure experimentation and you can do it too. =]

1318898215.0,lfqz0,An idea I would like to run by you guys - Project Reddit Rape,CyberVillian,1,3,0,"It is something I was planning on coding up. I don't need help on how to do it

Here is my idea:
The site will probably be called RedditRape. The general purpose of this project would be to let owners of subreddits make money

How it would work:
An owner of a subreddit can site up for our site by simply providing email

A regular user can sign up to the site and purchase ReditRape points. They can use the points that they've purchase to temporarily change a user's user-flair and/or temporarily ban a user from a participating subreddit.

Everytime a user spends points on a particular subreddit
