* Buy a pee funnel.  Seriously one of the best purchases I've made for outdoor use.  I have the [pStyle](http://www.thepstyle.com/) and I'm quite fond of it because it's really easy to clean.
* Menstrual Cups.  I use the Divacup
* Panty liners.  I always wear a panty liner while backpacking so I don't have to use toilet paper when I pee.  I know this sounds really gross, this might not be the best idea for you.
* Down there is sensitive.  If you can't deal with synthetic underwear, which is why I bring 4 pairs.
* For extra cleanup, or your body.  Basically, use up one of those liquid drink mixes but keep the bottle.  Fill it with water and spray off your pee funnel, your menstrual cup, and yourself.  This is particularly good for helping prevent UTIs and yeast infections as a clean vagina is a healthy vagina - although I'd suggest stripping before cleaning yourself!  Also, don't use alcohol wipes - it will just upset your balance.
* If you have long hair
* For showering, and then go to town.  I really like having a pack towel as well as a bandanna for showering.
* For buying gear, a really, really important component is the sleeping pad.  I have an all-season pad with an R value of 4.9 which is awesome.
* Take advantage of female gear if it's applicable.  Women's specific gear isn't just a girly color (usually!).  It's often tailored to work better with female bodies.  For example, and a bit less in the shoulders.  Sometimes they will also be a bit overstuffed, particularly in the foot region.  Woman's trekking poles are often a bit shorter and therefore lighter (if you're a short guy, might want to look at these!) and sometimes have smaller grips
* Clothing is one of the most aggravating things for female backpackers - particularly if you do not have an 'athletic' build.  I have quite ample hips and butt and ended up buying rock climbing pants opposed to regular hiking pants as they have stretch to them and made it possible for me to fit into them.  Additionally

1368343398.0,1e69pa,Hearing footsteps outside the tent at night. . .,velocide,321,36,115,"So, grassy meadow, but the trail looked like it hadn't been used recently.

I stayed up about an hour after my son went to sleep in his tent, falling asleep, the air was pretty still, and the only sounds were the insects and the occasional owl.  But then I heard a crunchy noise, like footsteps in the dirt.  ""crunch, crunch"". I couldn't really tell, from inside my tent, because I wasn't hearing grass or bushes being disturbed.  ""crunch crunch.   crunch crunch"".  It was very tentative. And in pairs.  Like a bipedal animal.  I tried to imagine what it could possibly be.  A deer?  Definitely not a bear.  I had our food in a bear cannister

I thought that it could be a person - maybe.  But I really couldn't imagine anyone else hiking up that trail in the dark. We had had a hard enough time in the daylight.   We hadn't seen anybody else on the trail all day, that morning.  ""crunch crunch.  crunch crunch"".  

I quickly grabbed my headlamp, and scanned the surroundings. I did a pretty quick sweep. Nothing. I turned off the light. I had made a lot of noise, but I didn't wake my son.  I waited a few minutes, but I didn't hear anything. I tried the light again.  Nothing.  I called out to my son, and woke him up.  He didn't hear anything either.  I just ended up making him nervous.  

I zipped up the tent, listening. Minutes ticked by, and I heard nothing more.   Hours - and nothing.  Had I imagined it?  What could it have been?


Eventually, it was already light, though the sun hadn't yet crested the ridge to our east.  ""crunch crunch""  - There's that sound again! only now I can hear exactly where it's coming from, because I'm laying on my side, not my back.  It's coming from right under my head.  

That's when I remembered that when I set up my tent, maybe inches under my head.

TL;DR - Wasn't a bigfoot. Was a gopher under my tent.",self,t5_2qqom,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/comments/1e69pa/hearing_footsteps_outside_the_tent_at_night/

I came up with camping syndrome from Paris Syndrome : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_syndrome

Last month

* They complained that it was too cold (40-50F) at night. They wore hooded sweaters at night.

* They complained that camping is dirty. 

* On the first morning

* Their camping spot has a fire-pit with a grill but they were hungry so they drove 20 miles out of the camping spot to grab fast food

I know some other people who have mentioned ""I would love to go camping - I love nature!"" who act similar to these two individuals. I could be wrong but I feel like these people just have 'Camping Syndrome'.

A little about our crews and how we work:
We have eight people on a crew (two leaders and six americorps corpsmembers). We typically work eight days on and six days off, staircase construction, drainage, retaining walls, re-routes, and log outs with chainsaws or crosscuts (depending on wilderness status).

So yeah

*It has M&amp;Ms.*  
Delicious

You buy them, nuts, and some sweets"" without realizing the mental agony which is about to consume you.  

You have a long day of hiking, 5 peanuts, an almond, and 2 M&amp;M's - *The perfect bite*  

It's wonderful, but it's okay.  You grab again:  6 peanuts, 1 raisin, 1 almond:  ""Ugh, all I want is one measly M&amp;M.""  You look back into the bag and notice a glorious conglomerate of colored candies in a certain spot.  2 peanuts, 3 raisins, *Five M&amp;M's*.  You look around to make sure no one is judging you.  It feels almost dirty.  

Instantly

Later on,"" you say.  ""Then I will have an even amount of M&amp;M's left at the end of the bag.""  Listen to yourself.  It's pathetic.  You start grabbing for the trail mix, but you notice that you can *feel* the shape of the M&amp;M's.  You can discern every bite with the touch of your fingers.  

*Face it
*Who cares if the last of the bag doesn't have any?*  
All of these thoughts start to invade your mind.  

You're hiking, what a lovely chocolate-capped mountain.. I.. mean.. ice-capped mountain,"" You say.  Your hiking friends look at you strangely.  *Screw them,* You think.  *They're not your real friends.*  *They just want your M&amp;M's.*  *I fucking know Brian has been eating some, and he doesn't even ration them.*  

You can't take it any more.  You tell your friends to go ahead of you as you pull out the bag.  You tear at the contents, as you sit with a full belly against a rock.  You can hardly move, but Damn, was it worth it.  

As you consider the possibility of never buying trail mix again and changing your life

It's too late.",self,t5_2qqom,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CampingandHiking/comments/1jmjuc/the_problem_with_trail_mix/

This was a decently reviewed product.  Even today

**My problem with gear review sites is that they either are spammy or they tend to have mostly good reviews for everything.**  I’ve also seen way too many reviews of backpacking gear that started with “I just got X last week and it’s great!”  That’s nice

I’m sure most of us are familiar with [trailjournals.com](http://trailjournals.com/).  I love following along with random people’s hikes and dream about my future hikes.  It turns out that people hiking 2179 miles have some strong opinions on their gear.  I trust these accumulated anecdotes a lot more than random reviews from a site that has an interest in selling gear.

OK

On the flip side

“...In Bear Mountain

**1300 miles out of two pairs of socks.**  That’s the sort of thing I want to know when picking out backpacking socks.

Right now I only have a few categories: [Backpacks](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Backpacks), [Water Purifiers](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Water-Purifiers), [Headlamps](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Headlamps), [Socks](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Socks), and [Tents](http://www.bestbackpackingreviews.com/Tents).  I’m adding more products and categories as I have time.

I’m looking for feedback.  Any feedback is great

1. Does the concept make sense?
2. Is the lack of graphic design sense so bad that it detracts from the usefulness?
3. What products are missing that you are curious about?
4. What other uses of the dataset can you think of?
