The battle is over and we - PC gamers, Lancers and the rest - have won. You've not only met every goal we set, you've exceeded them. Star Citizen will be released because of your dedication and your willingness to put your money where our mouths are. Our gratitude is immeasurable; we owe you our livelihoods and will not soon forget it.

The question is: what happens next?

Our intention has always been to make Roberts Space Industries YOUR site. It's not a public advertisement for the game; it's a private community for those who are making the game happen. We want your input on what we're doing and we want to share our plans with you; the occasional passer-by doesn't concern us. The plan was initially to immediately switch on a wall that would allow only you, which may take up to two weeks, otherwise we would be blocking thousands of backers from participating.

Updates and features will continue, wives, children and yes, pets, miss us!) We will also be launching new sections which have been in the works for some time: the Galactapedia will tell you more about the Star Citizen world, Engineering will introduce you to game mechanics that are being planned and Holovids will offer you video footage from the game as it takes shape.

What about pledges? Good news: those of you who got in on the ground floor are covered. Your ships have lifetime insurance policies and for the next year you will have the ability to purchase further tiers or upgrade existing ones at the initial prices. That's not true of everyone else: if you want to back Star Citizen and participate in this amazing community, for example.)

One issue which concerns us is what to do with the funding tracker. So we're going to throw the issue up to you: in two weeks, remove it or put it somewhere else? We'll let the community decide.

We also have previously outlined the 'behind the screens' subscription plans available now. They're designed for users who simply want to give us a little extra support during the development - you're getting the whole story

We can't thank you enough for everything you've done for this project. Please see the next update on 'The Pledge' for our promise to you. The next two years are going to be incredible for all involved and we're thoroughly happy that all of you are along for this exciting ride.",self,t5_2v94d,1353352560.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13gofe/it_is_finished_over_62_million_pledged/

* Ship boarding and FPS combat. I know it's already built into Crytek
* The economy system. I'm specifically referring to the way that AI is supposed to buy, as well as transport information from one system to the next. It's an interesting idea, and once again I think it would be great to have such detail, but I fear it could be a very difficult to implement correctly. Economies are incredibly complex, and simulating something like this on a galactic scale sounds like a huge undertaking. Not to mention getting the balance right so that prices don't just go all over the place. And then there's the fact that the AI presence is supposed to grow/diminish based on the player activity in a system. 

The drive to get more money isn't helping

I am hopeful that by crowdfunding

Looks like RSI will hit the magic $10mil before the end of the week.

**Will my computer be able to run SC?**

From Kickstarter FAQ:

&gt;At the moment you will be able to play it on a dual core PC with a GTX 460 or greater and 4GB of system memory. If you’re running an i7 2500, their system requirements will stay roughly the same as ours.

Considering the game has a couple years to be released, the hangar module, and the dogfighting alpha to get an idea of what you need to change. During this time, new CPUs and GPUs will come out and the price of current generations will drop.

**How can I get access to the alpha or beta?**

You need to purchase a package that includes the alpha and beta (for example

**What ship should I get?**

That depends. Here is a current list of ships that have been sold on the site. There are some limited edition ships here that have been available for purchase a couple times but will probably not be available again; the only way to get these ships is to find someone willing to gift/sell you a ship they have purchased. In order of ability to purchase and manufacturer:

*Ships currently for sale:*

[*RSI Aurora:*](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/d5uc8684zn6etr/source/Aurora_brochure.pdf) The cheapest ship. You will need to customize this ship with upgrades to make it what you want. $25 for the ship. $30 for one package (this is the only package that does not grant access to alpha or beta) or $40 for a package with alpha and beta. There are also some variants that were sold for a limited time.

[*RSI Constellation:*](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/fvuwqq1t17wzkr/source/RSIConstellationMK3BrochureV2.pdf) A multi-person ship. Good for bounty hunters, and merchants. It has a good sized cargo area, a snub fighter, turrets, and missiles for defense. $225 for just the ship. $275/$550/$1150 if bought with in a package that includes in game and physical items.

*Anvil Hornet:* Civilian version of the military Hornet. Durable ship for dogfighting. $110 for the ship

[*Origin 300i:*](https://robertsspaceindustries.com/media/exfjsh7mejoxir/source/300series_brochure.pdf) built for touring with upgraded versions that are more specialized (more on those later). $55 for the ship

*Origin 315p:* Built for exploration. The 315p is a modified version of the 300i with long-range engines and a tractor beam. $65 for the ship

*Origin 325a:* Built for dogfighting. The 325a has missile launchers and a mass driver cannon pre-installed. $70 for the ship

*MISC Freelancer:* Could be used as a merchant ship or an explorer

*Drake Cutlass:* A fighter favored by pirates. Has a larger cargo hold than other fighters and comes with a tractor beam. Not available as just the ship

*Aegis Avenger:* An interdiction ship. Sturdy ship with central heavy gun mount with a total of 5 gun mounts. The ships seem to come with better sensors and computer systems than many other fighters (though exactly what that entails is not clear). The engines are powerful

*Ships not currently for sale:*

*RSI Aurora Marque:* Not available for purchase currently. An interdiction ship that comes with 2 laser cannons and a more powerful engine than the base Aurora.

*RSI Aurora Clipper:* Not available for purchase currently. Light Mercantile. It has weaker engines but has room for a cargo addon.

*RSI Aurora Legionnaire:* Not available for purchase currently (and the only one on this list that has never been for sale). Combat model of the Aurora. Looks like it will be used in militias. Has more powerful engines, but is also heavier.

*RSI Aurora LX:* Not available for purchase currently. An exploration and light mercantile ship. It has powerful engines, and you can customize it far more than other Aurora models.

*Origin 350r:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time

*Origin M50:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, and dogfighting if you want to use speed (not armor and powerful weapons) to win.

*MISC Starfarer:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time

*Drake Caterpillar:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, and room for a small boarding party. It is still a freighter however and will not be able to take down most ships solo.

*Aegis Retaliator:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time, an explorer, or a passenger craft.

*Aegis Idris Corvette:* Not currently for sale (very limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time

*Anvil Gladiator:* Not currently for sale (limited edition ship). It may become available again for a limited time

*Vanduul Scythe:* Only were made available for a short time during the initial kickstarter campaign. These are the ships attacking the Bengal Carrier in the Star Citizen trailer. They are raiding ships that you will have to capture in game. Vanduul warriors are known to self-destruct making this a difficult challenge.

The Grand Admiral package ($2, Constellation, Hornet, and 300i.

For original backers



**Which ship is better: X or Y?**

That is impossible to answer. CR has stated that this game will be heavily skill-based so all ships are viable, however each ship has a place. If a ship has more powerful engines, it has probably sacrificed on shields and/or weapons to account for the increased power draw of the engines. If a ship has better armor, it will be less maneuverable and be slower than other ships or it will sacrifice adding weapons in order to boost the engine size. This means that no ship is the ""best"" it just has a different role and works towards a different play style. Do you enjoy zipping around dodging enemy attacks while whittling away the opponent's shields and systems, or do you want to go in guns blazing with the ability to take a few hits and come away unscathed? Again, this is speculation.


**What is Lifetime Insurance?**

If your ship is destroyed


**Will I have Lifetime Insurance/How can I get LTI?**

If you ordered a ship before July 6th


**I want to get a different ship than the one I purchased

Yup! Go to My RSI &gt; My Hangar and reclaim any purchase you don't want anymore. This will give you store credit that you can apply to another purchase (this is not a refund


**Are all ships available for purchase on the site available in the game?**

Yes. Every ship currently available for purchase can be purchased in game. The only ship that you can't purchase that was available for a brief period of time is the Vanduul fighter. The only way to get that in game is to capture one (and it will be very difficult to do so).

When it comes to peripheral controls even in the gaming community there seems to be a lot of partial understandings of what is going on, keep using it. If your happy with your joystick, keep using it.  Is a mouse more accurate then a joystick? Is a joystick superior to a mouse? Well...   yes to both.  Aaaaand no to both. The real answer? It depends. It depends on what type of movement/inputs the application was engineered around, and the nuts and bolts of how an input device tries to comply.  While people can use whatever controls they like and can call it whatever they want, from an objective standpoint different types of control schemes are not arbitrarily interchangeable and do not yield equal results.  It's important to understand the nuances of these issues, particularly if a user is may choose to try to influence the path a game designer takes on how controls should or shouldn't be implemented. 

What types of inputs are there? Up until recently, or **Absolute**.  While correct on some levels and possessing enough kernels of truth to make most people understand what I'm talking about and generally accept my previous explanations, in reality its a case of over-simplification coupled with incorrect nomenclature stemming from my own ignorance. In the process of trying to get to the bottom of the subject I've found myself having to sort through conflicting information when trying to satisfactorily answer good questions posed to me in previous threads/attempts at this.  I'm just a guy that wanted his joystick not to suck when he stomped around in his internet robot and before even playing MechWarriorOnline I read up enough on the forums to know I would have to make one to make this work right since it was one of those 'mouse games', although at that point woefully lacked the proper explanations as to mechanics of what made it so, despite having dabbled with flight sims and hacking/fabricating control projects for years.    

For other projects, and  it forced me to look deeper into the problems and solutions in order to back up my claims. It was relieving to finally get science behind me, cause it's true: it's not the joystick but rather the *type of joystick* vs the *type of inputs* the application is designed around. This is not specific to MWO or Star Citizen, or any game in particular, although it was MWO that got me out of my comfort zone far enough to write this and provides a good example for comparing controls.  All games or applications requiring human controls, particularly pointing devices, are designed around specific input types and deviating from the standard prescription rarely proves effective or efficient. 

If one defines controls as simply being '*relative*' or '*absolute*' as I have been doing up until recently, which is then turned into relative input commands, with the pointer/cursor/reticule capable of infinite travel in the axes.  So depending on what part your taking about, it too is both an absolute or a relative device, so neither of these terms cut to the actual heart of the matter despite being able to accurately describe what is happening during different parts of the process. 


Then what are we *supposed* to call this stuff?  

This falls under the engineering field of what are called Human Factors. There are numerous types of inputs that are recognized in this field which further subdivide into more specific types, the easier it is for a human to utilize it for precision tasks, and the orders are loosely based on how many actions are required to achieve the desired effect when used in their native application (things get wonky when you swap as outlined below) or how or how complex it is in general. It's important to differentiate between these inputs, because they are not particularly interchangeable design criteria and substituting one for the other predictably yields less than optimal results. Identifying the control scheme that any given game or system is engineered around is step one for coming up with viable control schemes beyond the standard options.    
 
**Control Types:** -attributes (common examples; notes)   
 
 
* **zero-order control** - manipulates target position. (mouse
* **first-order control** - manipulates target velocity. (most joysticks
* **second-order control** - manipulates target acceleration/rate of velocity change. (car steering wheel) 
* **third-order control** - notable lag between control input and perceived action (steering a tanker)   

Joysticks further subdivide based on their mechanical and electromechanical properties: 

* **Isotonic**: cursor moves as a result of movement of the joystick handle. (my mech joystick. other?) 

* **Isometric**: cursor moves as a result of the force applied to the joystick handle
 
* **Spring-loaded:** resistance is proportional to force applied. Displacement produces proportional inputs

In all my previous rants on the subject, however the net result of what I have been hammering at remains correct and there is a large body of scientific studies that demonstrably prove applications designed around zero-order inputs can not be as effectively operated with a first or second-order controller, and likewise first order applications are not more accurately or easily manipulated with a zero order controller and it is my hopes to make people understand why.     

MWO is engineered around zero-order inputs, a mouse really is the easiest input device to use, since it offers very high precision, ease of use, and is the most common form of this type of controller so everyone is already set up to utilize this input type. 

[What if I told you...](http://i.imgur.com/BfkfHVH.png)      Well, sometimes isometric), and is engineered around very different principals than a zero-order device.  Below I will outline the differences, and why they matter when trying to substitute a first-order controller like a *normal joystick for an application designed around zero-order mechanics like a mouse.  


**Using A First Order Controller For Zero-Order Applications:** (aka using a *joystick in a shooter)   
 
**-attributes** (effects) 

* **First-Order Controller; Standard Joystick:**    
 
* **-moves in pitch/roll** (unnatural range of motion
* **-Spring Loaded
* **-requires deadzones** (distracting, wasted range of motion, lag)
* **-fixed displacement generates directional velocity** ( ie relative inputs, requires 2 precision actions to complete one positional change) 

**Zero-Order Controller; Mouse:** 

* **-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane** (natural range of movement of the cursor/reticule) 
* **-no spring centering or detents** (nothing fighting inputs
* **-no deadzones** (always in control
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position** (obvious and easy to control

**Zero-Order Controller; My Mech Joystick:** 

* **-moves in zenith/azimuth** (pitch/twist -natural range of movement of the mech) 
* **-Isotonic, always maintains physical orientation related to on-screen state) 
* **-no deadzones** (always in control
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position** (obvious and easy to control
 
 For anyone that doesn't understand the significance of *zero-order* vs *first-order controls*

Picture a 12"" square sheet of glass and a marble sitting on it. Using a first-order controller is like trying to move the marble by picking up the sheet of glass with the marble balanced on it and tilting it front/back and side/side to move the marble, proportional to the amount of deflection, which must be quickly brought back level to discontinue the input reaction. Controllers made for this task are specifically engineered to facilitate these inputs with ease. Springs hold it level, obvious centers, deadzones etc, and every convenience feature built into it for this mode becomes a hindrance the second you press it into service as a zero-order.  

Using a zero-order controller on the other hand, and it's very easy to perform this single action very quickly with very high precision. Just like above though, the mechanical features engineered into these devices produces quite a very specialized form factor to make this easy. Just like above, all the things that make it easy to use for it's native applications work against you the moment you attempt to use a mouse as a first order controller as I will show.    
  
Working it from the other direction to further demonstrate the importance of using the right control type for a given application

**Using A Zero-Order Controller For First-Order Applications:** (aka flying with a mouse)  

 **-attributes** (effects) 

* **First-Order Controller; Standard Joystick:**    
 
* **-moves in pitch/roll** (natural range of movement of the aircraft/spacecraft
* **-Spring Loaded
* **-requires deadzones** (allows a safe area free of inputs
* **-fixed displacement generates directional velocity** ( ie relative inputs, intuitive control, takes single precision action to perform) 

**Zero-Order Controller; Mouse:** 

* **-moves in x/y Cartesian Plane**  (unnatural range of movement
* **-no spring centering or detents** (no feedback to mechanically gauge inputs
* **-no deadzones** (no safe zone to keep from spamming the axes
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position** (awkward and difficult to control

**Zero-Order Controller; My Mech Joystick:** 

* **-moves in zenith/azimuth** (unnatural range of movement
* **-Isotonic
* **-no deadzones** (no safe zone to keep from spamming the axes
* **-fixed displacement generates fixed position**  (awkward and difficult to control

**tl;dr:** controls are complicated

If your everyday player is able to play as the Xi'an, one who will be running around like a chicken with its head cut off, definitely breaking immersion. Now, one could feasibly role-play these races, but there is only so much roleplaying to be done before inhibiting the fun you're supposed to be having. Imagine trying to role-play aliens like the [Hanar](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Hanar) or [Elcor](http://masseffect.wikia.com/wiki/Elcor) from Mass Effect. There would be a lot of time spent standing around and a lot of time spent formulating ridiculous sentences.

Of course, leaving us with only Star Trek-esque aliens whose only differences from humans are antennae or a few bumps on the forehead. If there are mechanical benefits, you'd then have to distinguish humans with their own or you'd be at a disadvantage playing as one.

&gt;1) Combat Practicality/Opportunity Cost

 Would a 4 man crewed connie really be better then a 1 man connie with 3 auroras flying with him? What about if they were flying hornets

&gt;2) Crew member Flexibility

Lets say you're on your friends connie and you guys are going to do a transport mission that he has picked up

&gt;3) Player Engagement

After the novelty of it wears off, really want they want to join me as crew instead of flying their own ships with me. Why would someone choose to man my turret rather then fly formation with me in their own ship. Lets face it, if you come aboard a connie, freelancer, starfarer, ect, in order to man the turret and combat does not happen then congratulation you just spent X amount of hours sitting there and twiddling your thumbs while watching the pilot fly and have fun.

------------
Now there are a few mitigating factors that I have thought but many of them have good counter arguments as well.

A) ""Fuel cost: 4 people flying one ship is probably cheaper then 4 people flying 4 ships."" Yes

B) Novelty: ""While it may wear off after a while having 4 friends pilot one ship is a game experience that we don't get often and I think that it will be very enjoyable the first few times a couple of good friends get together."" This is a more valid counter point then the saving fuel, connies, ect that are just crewed by one person with NPCs or automated system upgrades because no other players want to crew with them.

C: ""Its a great option for new players or players without ships

D) ""Because its fun you twit stop nitpicking!""...............I haven't found a count argument to this point yet.

                Well this spiraled into a wall of text

**Note:** I am not trying to preach doom here. I really like the idea of this game and I love ships like the Connie and will probably be pledging for it either tonight or tomorrow and flying around with my friends in a space ship is one of the principle reasons for that but some of the above concerns have put a small dent into my enthusiasm.

I would love to hear your opinions on the matter. 
What do you think? What did I miss? Where might I be right? Where am I dead wrong?

Your **handle** is *unique* and *public* and *cannot be changed*, as well as visible in-game when you are scanned.

Your **community moniker** is your displayed name in forum posts

The community moniker can be changed at any time.  I'm not sure about character names / callsigns in-game, and a callsign you can change at will.  That's just speculation on my part though.

however after browsing the official forums there appears to be many players who equate attacking someone as griefing. it doesnt matter that im a pirate. As a pirate if i find any oppurtunity for an easy kill im going to take it. . if its the fourth time ive killed you that hour is it my fault for killing you or your fault for trying to mine more rare minerals in low security space? 

The game was designed with dogfighting in mind and while i will definitely have an alt thats an intergalactic explorer the reason i bought this game is because i like to shoot things. At the end of the day a player who wants to play PvE exclusively can play offline but if i want to PvP i need the persistent universe so it makes no sense to heavily restrict my ability to do so to accommodate the PvE player.

I didn't include a more detailed point of view because I thought some of you would agree with me and it might start a discussion.

Also

I feel like the use of the word ""star"" is pretty over done in science fiction: Starman, Death Star, Star Babies... Those are just off the top of my head. It's good in the sense that it indicates it's sci-fi, but also give it kind of a cheap, uncreative feel.

""Citizen"" makes me feel like it's going to a be a really dull societal simulation where you go to work

I guess I think Star Citizen is a bad name because it makes the game sound unremarkable and boring. Imagine if you'd never heard of the game and someone just told you the name and didn't have time to get into it except that it was good.

Star Trek implies travel and adventure in space. Star Wars implies conflict in space. Star Citizen implies that you won't be deported

EVE: Online is a better name, which ties into the fluff and generally when you explain the setup for the EVE universe, it makes it sound fairly intriguing. 

I would suggest a better name, but I still hope Star Citizen is just the working title and they come up with something better before the game is released.

1. Will achievements be in

2. Control of capital ships? Multi man or can be solo'd? ( this one has been talked about but I think it needs to still be further clarified as I'm the type of guy who wants the BIGGEST DAMN SHIP even if I have to have a guild of 100+ to fund it!)

3. Cash Shop - How will it work exactly

4. What happens if I loose connection / quit in the middle of a battle? What if friends are on my capital ship when I do?

5. What are some of the things we will be doing to progress our characters in the game?
What else besides trading/shooting things and exploring the universe?

6. It was mentioned ships are made up of 100s of parts that can be damaged are these parts we can choose?

7. More details on how much we can customize our ships and how much of this will be from the Cash Shop?

8. Team dynamics

9. Will you be able to collide with these parts

10. With regard to pilotable ships, or are there going to be certain ships (or class of) that will be off-limits for players?

11. Will Cloud Imperium have any direct influence on the in-game world as peace-keepers or financial corporations? Will you be visible at all in-game?

12. Will you be posting updates on the progress of things? I know you'll have plenty on your plates just making the game, screen shots, [other random tid-bits] etc.

13. Further clarification of the indestructibility of pledge ships

If we allow multiple people apart from just the captain to  store in the cargo hold this would allow the proper development of a space haulage system. 

Escrow delivery missions which could be organised through space bar interface and could include passengers as well as freight. 

I can imagine a Player generated mission database with some of the following characteristics:

* can do both looking for ship and looking for crew

* eg trader has a 30t cargo he wants shipped which he can't fit in his aurora. So he hires a constellation to haul him and his cargo to his destination. He can defend his cargo enroute if the constellation is attacked (and there's a spare gunners seat) or just stay in his bunk til he gets there. After that he can either buy a new ship at his destination or buy passage on another ship ( eg converted Retaliator). In this case it's obviously better to buy passage on the constellation as you eliminate the extra fuel cost

* some kind of rules about when and how the cargo can be unloaded. Maybe set up in the contract? Eg a slider between 'captain has full discretion' (maybe some payout if it's dumped inappropriately -eg abandoned in space to make a getaway) all the way to 'full cargo lock' where it can only be unloaded at the agreed destination or with owner's say so (might be higher up front and overall cost to the owner?)

* looking for crew might be similar - where the captain can specify how long the contract lasts and the pickup and drop off points. 

* some communication line with the generator of the contract - can accept or refine

* you could also have a covert system for illegal cargo. Captains could mention they're happy to take 'sensitive cargo' as they have the necessary equipment (cargo scan blockers). This could be quite risky as a bounty hunter might read this and wait until they leave the station with the illegal cargo and then turn them over to the authorities. 

* lastly if you have such a system an emergent space taxi system would appear. Players may want to go to a different system (their new hornet is 200000 credits at X rather than 300000 where he is now but he wants to keep his aurora at his current base) and rather than having an immersion breaking Fast-Travel system you could have a player based system. Would thereby give rise to the fluff point about the Retaliator where they have been converted from large Capital ship killer bombers to long haul passenger crafts. If you have a cargo hold modification you may be able to have hibernation pods/ extra beds for someone to sleep in which you could then deliver as cargo at the target, you could incorporate this system into the hibernation pods (maybe as an upgraded form) to give passengers something to do whilst they're travelling if they are still online. 

This would hopefully both give a robust system for organising crew and give them a reason to be there. In addition it would give a sensible

Awesome! I start up my PC, log in with some awesome menu music playing in the background as the server loads, and them I'm ready to go. In game, my character is just waking up from the bunk or cyrofreezer he's been sleeping in onboard my spaceship, still resting in the hanger where I docked last night before logging off. My last trade run wasn't as successful as I'd hoped and I'm running a little low on credits right now so I figure mining would be a good way to raise some quick cash. This is one of my main spaceports and I'm renting a warehouse here, so I walk over to the cargo terminal, call up my inventory and begin loading up my cargo hold. As I do, I'm ready to go. After a quick check with flight control to make sure no one's currently fighting up in orbit (there shouldn't be

For today's mining endeavor, it's relatively new (only discovered a couple of weeks ago) so it hasn't been well-charted yet and there should be plenty of metals to mine. With the course entered into my flight computer, I navigate to the nearest wormhole and I'm on my way.

A dozen jumps later, it stays where I put it and keeps me updated with radar telemetry as long as my ship stays within it's transmission range (small for a basic unit, but I can always deploya . I'm well within range right now, so the first thing my bouy does is fire up it's active radar array and begin mapping nearby space. As the nav data said, it's full of asteriods. Most of the area is still in shadows but my radar bouy will continue to update and improve my map the longer it sits there. The second thing this does is tell me if they are any ships nearby without revealing what I am. I'm flying a medium freighter, perfect for a bit of mining and trading, and I have a medium radar array on board. If I turn my ship's radar array on though, I'm slower and less maneuverable than a small attack fighter. Small ships can't hold a medium radar

Ok, so they probably can't see my ship. Next thing I do is ready and launch a couple of prospecting drones. Simple single-engine, fire-and-forget drones, these fly in a straight line until they run out of fuel and scan the asteroid field for material composition, transmitting the data back to my ship in realtime. I paid for an upgraded model that burns half it's fuel on the way out, spins around and burns the second half on the way back so I don't need to go pick them up afterwards. (It takes a lot of time and fuel, but these drones are more expensive than the basic radar bouy, I'm looking over the data they send back. I pick out a few large

Arriving at the asteroid, hidden from view from the wormhole, and deploy my mining robots. Once mining commences, I set up alarms, power down non-essential systems in my ship to save fuel and reduce my EM signature, and alt-tab out to Reddit or YouTube or watch a movie on Netflix while my robot minions do the hard work.

* ALERT * ALERT * ALERT *

Alarms ringing in my headset bring me back an hour later, not a nav bouy I note. Has he seem me? Probably not yet. I took care hiding my ship but he'd have to be blind to miss my bouy. There's another benefit about the basic bouy: they're cheap enough that you find them everywhere, left behind if the owner forgot to pick them up and didn't want to spend the fuel going back. Hell, they're not even worth salvaging most of the time.

The other ship starts flying slowly, I begin checking my allies. No one nearby. How about trusted mercenaries? Closest one is six jumps away and he'd want an arm and a leg even if he could make it in time. No go there either. What's the other ship doing? Still circling the wormhole. Just in case, I tell my robots to slowly start making their way back to my ship with a low power transmission (short range, hard to detect).

Then the message burst arrives: ""Pay up 250, ready engines, ready sheilds, ready weapons (what few I have, I am a mining ship after all), get those robots back on board ASAP! The nav computer tells me two of them are too far away and aren't going to make it back before the pirate ship reaches me. That's bad because they're expensive and I'll have to replace them, but damn if I'm going to let some pirate salvage them. I flip a few switches and throw a small nuclear proximity mine at the asteroid. Hard to disarm, it'll make the pirate think twice before attempting a salve op so there's a change at least that I can come back and retrieve my robots later. Right now

I chose this system in part because it has two worm holes. I don't need the nav computer to tell me the pirate ship will catch me long before I reach the second worm hole, but the pirate ship is much more maneuverable than I am and if he's a skilled pilot, he'll probably win. So I'm going to to run for it. As soon as all but the last two drones are on board, I fire up my engines on beeline for the wormhole. Bullets and lasers zip into my sheild as we fly head on towards each other, the pirate opening up with everything he's got and me returning fire with a pitiful gatling turret while power from my main lasers is diverted to engines and sheilds. I survive thet first pass, sheilds holding steady at 80% while he turns around, bring his guns to bear on my rear and readying for a race to the worm hole.

Does he catch me? Do I pull a trump card out of my hold and blast his pirate ass to dust or do I throw everything I've got in into jump engines in hopes of pulling a small advantage when we emerge on the other side? Does he have a friend waiting there? Tune in for Part 2,False,self,t5_2v94d,False,,,t3_18evps

Greetings Citizens, dubbed v1.1. No doubt there will be refinements as I move forward, or maybe even some overhauling or just streamlining. I have a lot of respect for the members of the Star Citizen and MWO communities alike, and highly value feedback any of you have (witty tl;dr's?). If I have any of this wrong or anyone takes issue with anything presented here, all I ask is to let us discuss them in a manner that we both come away better for it. There are no stupid questions, and I welcome scrutiny too since without external pressures to do this better, I'd still be stuck on v1.0 below. This post is in preparation for my posting on the subject on the SC and MWO official forums, since along with the awesomeness of getting to help a game actually develop comes equally awesome responsibility. Its important we know what we're talking about in case we decide to lend a potentially influential opinion on the subject...        

**Preamble:**  

Many of you have already seen v1.0 of [my rantings on the subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/mwo/comments/1c52od/mwo_joystick_controls_worth_it/), it's no wonder.  A little background. I'm an engineering student, and a sailplane pilot IRL. I've been dorking out on sim projects since 2004, and have had the pleasure of comparing actual sailplane flying to sim flying to dial in my own projects as well as to help nail down realistic motion control parameters for Ian at builtforfun (http://bffsimulation.com/index.php), who is an instrumental character in the world of homegrown motion control simulator platforms and is the source of most motion platforms extraction parameter software and realistic dynamic motion cuing if you look close enough into most functional motion control cockpits.  I have worked on other motion control projects with RolandVanRoy (simprojects.nl), and [designed an analog servo circuit](http://i.imgur.com/gXlN0wu.jpg) that can be used in both control loading (force feedback) as well as motion control, which has been tested to good effect

Through experiments conducted while being able to jump back and forth from my Cockpit to my cockpit, but it may require knowing more about the controls than is common in some cases. I'm not saying there isn't a lot more to it, just that these are the bare minimum items that need to be taken care of first or else the rest of a simulator project runs the risk of becoming irrelevant. From my experiences, most of what immersion there is to be had comes from these 4 things, and the better they are done the more believable the effect. Going beyond these in most cases is an exercise in diminishing returns from what I've observed, and likewise failure to sufficiently meet the requirements of these initial 4 items can break the magic of even the most visually detailed cockpit.  These 4 items are the key to hitting what I call the 'saturation point', the subtle point at which one can effortlessly suspend their disbelief and they become fully engrossed in the virtual task at hand. To me

**The Pillars of Immersion**  

* 1. Correct seating position/ergonomics       
* 2. Believable/functional controls      
* 3. Fill thy eye with screen       
* 4. High fidelity audio  

Sounds simple enough, 3 and 4 can potentially be easy, but number 2 is where it normally falls apart since controls can be a complicated subject when you examine them more closely, and also  is by far the most important item on this short list.  I didn't specify head tracking there, since it's kinda a cross between lines 2 and 3, but if there is *any* view panning function in-game, this really should be done with head tracking and *almost* warrants a pillar of it's own.  The interface you use to experience a simulator is not there to augment the experience, especially controls

So I've had an Oculus dev kit for a fair while now and have been building stuff for it

# **Tech specs**:  
- Assuming they bump the consumer kit specs to 1080p, you're pushing a lot more pixels - so don't count on being able to plug it in to an existing setup and get better perf.  It will be **slower** for most people.  

# **Input peripheral usage impact**:  

**Keyboard**:  
- When you're wearing a Rift, even highly experienced users get tripped up because they actually heavily use peripheral vision to help them keep their hands in the right place, especially if you're moving 1+ hands between mouse/joystick and the keyboard.  
- It then takes noticeable time to constantly reorient your hands (e.g. finding the bumps on F and J keys on the home row of a standard keyboard) or even lifting the headset up for a second, etc.  

**Mouse/stick/HOTAS/controller/G13/Nostromo**:  
-  Using these actually seems quite natural since they have more defined shapes and fewer buttons. Once you have the layout memorized and built into muscle memory the Rift really fits naturally with these types of input mechanisms. I think there's a reason CR uses a controller in demos. You really need to be familiar with your button layout though.  

**Other peripherals**:  
- Peripherals like a Hydra also really shine with the Rift. I can see this being a natural direction to go for some games. However it's still bad for space sim games in particular because you need the up and down axes as well

**Peripheral usage summary**:  
- For Star Citizen I think it may also come down to how many buttons you need to use. If you can get away with just a HOTAS/mouse/gamepad (note CR was using an xbox controller) I think the OR be great. If you need 100 buttons and macros, etc.  

# **Combat effectiveness**:  
- My suspicion is the OR will be great for immersion just flying around

# **Immersion**:  
- One other major issue I'll note is turning speed. Unless you're used to it from RL experience, because ships can't turn and aim as fast as you can move your head. There may be articulated mounts/turrets which will allow perfect tracking, but it just wouldn't be fair/immersive/possible to do the same thing for steering/maneuvering or shooting fixed-mount weapons.  

# **Motion sickness**:  
- The motion sickness disconnect is a big issue for a lot of people
  
# **Comfort**:  
- even if they slim down the consumer model you'll still notice the weight - could get annoying for some people after a couple hours  
- they don't work super well with large glasses - I imagine this will continue to be true with a consumer version  
- they don't work well with big headsets - also unlikely to change  
- they're more uncomfortable in hot climates - they steam up
- you can't see anything around you - it's a hassle to try to grab a drink, or look at the time, or stay aware of your surroundings in general  
- The cord is pretty big and stiff and gets in the way - they're investigating wireless instead but that means the extra weight of a battery (so more uncomfortable)
- personally with the dev kit I can't go more than an hour or two without needing a break due to a combination of all the above

Why? Well, aside from making more sense when talking about cargo holds, it seems to open up slightly more possibilities of what can be put in a ship and how specific kinds of cargo loads affect that ship.

Hell; spaceships aren't trucks. An M50 pilot can load up on a solid block of osmium if they want to, just because). It's more balanced, makes more sense, and provides more freedom to measure cargo holds in volume, leaving the cargo itself to be measured in mass.

What i'd like to know is simply this: How is this game *not* pay-to-win?

The impression I've gotten from the small amount of reading i've done is that:

1. in-game credits are purchasable with real-life currency. 
2. in-game credits are used to buy gameplay affecting things.

My understanding is that: A non-paying player who plays X hours a week would be at a disadvantage competing with another player who also plays X hours a week but also pays $Y? Isn't this unfair?

As I said

----

**EDIT:** OK

1. The Ships are designed to follow the **""Perfect Imbalance"" design philosophy** *(also known as the Rock-Paper-Scissors approach)* in line with other successful games (e.g. Popular MOBA games like League of Legends). If anyone stumbles on this thread in future [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e31OSVZF77w) is a great video explaining the features and benefits of this type of system.
2. **Horizontal progression.** The upgrade system does not offer any straight-up power. There are always trade-offs.
3. **The lack of an ultimate goal.** No ultimate goal means being ""ahead"" of another player is a difficult thing to crystallize. Although I think this argument breaks down when you start talking about any specific scenarios.

1376796398.0,1kl5em,CR jumps into Newtonian Flight thread and sets record staight,cavortingwebeasties,30,1,13,"This weeks Wingman's Hangar [has a question about the flight model](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=astDHngLzyk&amp;t=650) and Newtonian physics (transcribed at the bottom)

A response thread quickly formed around the ambiguity of Chris's answer

Then

&gt;Nothing short of PvE vs PvP gets everyone riled up like the flight model!  

&gt;Here's some succinct answers to help put / remove my many ""umms"" and ""ahhs"" from the Forum Feedback section of Wing Man's Hangar.  

&gt;1) The physics simulation is Newtonian  

&gt;2) There is no drag.  

&gt;3) The IFCS (Intelligent Flight Control system) generally handles taking the pilot's inputs (desired pitch

&gt;4) Slowing down is caused by the pilot telling his IFCS that he wants to be traveling at a lower speed. The IFCS then communicates with the ships thrusters to adjust the ship's velocity accordingly.  

&gt;5) If you turn you engines and IFCS off you will continue to coast at the same velocity.  

&gt;6) Fuel is consumed by using your thrusters or main engines. If you coast you will not be using fuel

&gt;7) More advanced IFCS systems will allow you to turn of parts of its overrides or allow it to interpret you inputs differently - for instance you could tell it you want to go into an ""orientation"" not ""vectoring"" mode where it will take your joystick inputs as solely ship orientation inputs and not try to correct your ship's velocity vector to be aligned in the direction your ship is pointing (the famous Battlestar Galactica maneuver).  

&gt;8) We will limit the top speed of ships you can fly for technical issues (physics engines have problems when the numbers get too big) and fun - figuring out an intercept course for an opponent traveling at 0.2 speed of light (which is our fictional max for practical spaceflight in 2943) maybe be challenging if you're a mathematician or physicist but not what I call fun gameplay.  

&gt;9) This top speed will be less than the top speed of weapons.  

&gt;10) Top speed will probably be dependent on ship class but we haven't balanced this so it may be a matter of all ships having the same cap but the smaller faster ones can reach that limit much quicker (and therefore put some distance between them and their pursuers even if they go to max). This needs to be tuned so that people with the right kind of ships can run from a fight. The idea is that once you get enough separation between you and a hostile you can make the jump to autopilot / warp speed (using the Star Trek term)

&gt;11) I do know what G-Force is :-) I use the term as a measure of acceleration on the human body as its good short hand for people to grasp the concept of forces acting on a body when accelerating and decelerating. You may be interested to know that ""..The accelerations that are not produced by gravity are termed proper accelerations, irregardless of whether we are in the atmosphere or not. Its also interesting to note that we're built to withstand much greater accelerations in certain directions - modern day pilots can withstand 9 G but much less negative Gs. Its why you see pilots rolling and pulling back on the stick when attempting aggressive maneuvers rather than pushing forward or yawing with a rudder. The same will be true in space. We're going to factor in G-Force in the simulation, and allow pilots to push the boundaries (or switch the IFCS safety off) in search for a little advantage, but beware if you back (or red) out in a dogfight you may come to floating in space next to the smoking wreck of your ship!  

&gt;-Chris   

/thread

&gt;Question from Incompitence:  

&gt;Will inertia be Newtonian or will there be a ""resistive"" force that will eventually decrease a vector to zero?  

&gt;Application: Crank my 350r vector up to max

&gt;CR's answer:
(word by word)  


&gt;""so, and uhh, there's this endless debate that goes on but, ahh the ahh the underlying physics are of fully correct Newtonian, we just control the top speed of the various ships, and of the few other things mainly to make the game fun, but also there's sort of pseudo science reason for it, ahhm, you can't actually do that without killing yourself uhh, so generally uhhmm we don't uhhmm have a resistive force but we do sort of have limiting in the fiction the actual ship's computer or the flight control system limits the speed depending on the situation you are in ahhh based of dog-fighting so it wont let you go too fast

If it's ""really important, but if there is a lot of support for this, then it should be moved up in development priority regardless of how much money the project makes, not held hostage. Similarly, I thought the reason it wasn't being included initially was for balance reasons - why does raising $5.5 million suddenly make balancing the game a smaller issue?

Pirates, when profitable, but are just as likely to stab their ""buddy"" in the back as soon as it is advantageous to do so. This tells me that while you and your band of pirates are looking to rob some poor schlep you are just as likely to get attacked by another (player and NPC) group of pirates, your own crew, (player and NPC) police, hostile aliens, (player and NPC) bounty hunters and the escorts of the cargo you are trying to steal.

I feel that being a pirate is likely going to be **or at least should be** the hardest profession and will be filled by only the most bored and or skilled players who are looking for additional challenges. Many people have been saying that without choke points a lot of the time being a pirate in a high risk system is going to be sitting around waiting for a target to come your way so you can ruin his day. I would argue that in those systems everyone will be running for their lives just about constantly - and that is not only the way it should be but also good for the game!

I could be totally off base on this and perhaps pirates will all be buddy buddy and agree to not attack each other

I imagine this could be anything from just harassing some haulers to something as drastic as placing a forced embargo on some stations/planets/systems or blockading a trade lane for an amount of time or even something as shady/creative as pretending to be an 'escort' for large trade going down. Many possibilities for pirate shenanigans!

The kind of transmissions advertising these jobs could be on some 'black market' frequency or requires a particular piece of hardware to pick up. Something that maybe Bounty hunters may have to really have a hard time coming by. Whereas pirates could quite easily get their hands on them.

What has me so excited for this game is just how many opportunities exist to play the game differently.  Trading, etc.  there is the single player military campaign.  I am no expert at this point, but it seems like there are many guild and faction type goals that can be achieved as well.

I am somewhat worried that the learning curve will be extremely steep and make the game difficult for more casual players.  I will be hoping to scrape together a small group of core friends that can maybe man a constellation class ship

POST 1



&gt;Hi all
&gt;
&gt;Taking inspiration from previous Chris Roberts ship controls
&gt;
&gt;**All the elements of the HUD systems we’ve developed are based on procedural algorithms and can be customized to different ships and styles to a huge degree of depth and flexibility, to give pilots those crucial visual cues that can mean the difference between life and death in a dogfight. 
&gt;
&gt;The HUD will be your friend, including dozens of casual games and a custom gaming platform for a Bitcoin site I operate. I’m very much a DIY, self-employed developer, and this is my first team effort in over ten years. But this is a game I’m dying to play, and I couldn’t say no… I’ve been a fan of Chris’s work since I was a kid playing Wing Commander, and it’s a dream job for me to work with the team he’s assembled. 
&gt;
&gt;There are lots of reasons to pledge to this project, and thank you all for showing your support and helping to building this awesome game!


POST 2


&gt;I’m looking forward to showing off the design, you’ll notice the screen displays there look quite a bit different from anything in the other videos. What you’re seeing (for HUD-skeptics) are functional components with a lot of data layers and controls built in, but they aren’t engaged &gt;yet in that video.**
&gt;
&gt;Mea culpa, which is most of the reason why the targeting reticles and gun pips weren’t in for the live demo (which is why Chris missed the enemy ship — **and why some people seem to doubt the HUD exists). But I promise the end result is well worth it; you’ve never seen this stuff in a HUD before, because we had to rewrite parts of the CryENGINE/Scaleform integration code and roll a whole bunch of new graphics methods just to make it work.**
&gt;
&gt;I’ll shut up now before I say too much


POST 3


&gt;Thanks for such a warm welcome! Can’t believe so many people stopped by to say hi while I was sleeping. I’m by no means able to answer all the questions
&gt;
&gt;**I’m seeing a lot of questions about 2D vs. 3D displays
&gt;
&gt;**There’s a fixed holographic projection within the cockpit, acceleration, attitude, altitude, heading and targeting data. This projection has depth for greater effect (along the lines of what you see in that Scaleform promotional video), and also uses some 
&gt;(non-essential) stereoscopic depth cues to assist the pilot in reading certain situations more quickly. You don’t need an Oculus to get all the same info
&gt;
&gt;**In addition to that, power balancing, navigation maps, communications, etc). This HMD projection stays in your field of vision when you turn your head.**
&gt;
&gt;**Finally, color and opacity, and/or break into separate elements, depending on whether they’re being displayed on a flat screen or holographically. So yeah, there was definitely some inspiration from Minority Report and Iron Man, but at the same time these elements are very much in the CR space sim style, and my primary goal is to remain true to his original vision.**
&gt;
&gt;**I should stress that these projection layers exist, so we’re still in the process of getting the cockpit fully “wired”.**
&gt;
&gt;**And no
&gt;
&gt;Additionally, text in the HUD is not pre-rendered or even generated on the fly as a block; it’s printed procedurally to the displays one character at a time, with a greater likelihood of transcription error (or garbled transmission) depending on specific damage to your avionics or communications systems. Response to damage is a bedrock feature of every element in the HUD and has a negative impact on boot times, data latency and accuracy. If this sounds like something not recommended in a scaleform project, it isn’t – and they said it was crazy – but we’ve refactored, honed and optimized it to work.**
&gt;
&gt;So, stay tuned for the next vid!""

&gt;Good luck to all of us! 
&gt;
&gt;**I just want to say, custom drawing styles) are written to be extremely moddable. I imagine custom skins will be an early addition. Totally custom HUDs that include unique ship configurations are probably further down the road. We’ve overcome some major technical hurdles with Scaleform in terms of getting all of our procedural elements to work, although the trade-off is that we had to mod the SDK a bit so it’s not as easy to compile these things in. But the HUD is made to be very, very flexible… we’ve already got some in-house programs written to ease the process of integrating new elements and new ships… so I do think community modding of the HUD is ultimately in the cards.**
&gt;
&gt;Also: Personally, and the exploration/trading side of things (although with some good dogfights to spice it up). Actually one of my favorite games from back in the day was Starflight, which was pretty much all about that. **I still have great memories the planetary analysis that would piece together the atmospheric and mineral composition of new planets you’d orbit.** My 9-year-old best friend and I (can’t resist linking to him) decided to start a software company to build an open universe after playing that game, which ended a year later with a journal full of dozens of solar systems and a bunch of hypercard stacks. 
&gt;
&gt;**So from my perspective

In all of the video demos of flight mechanics and the role of physics, they're only ever being used to ""turn"" or roll the ship. Never are they shown being used for strafing or forward/backward movement. That is, they are never all pointed in the same direction.

To elaborate on my question: If I were to opt out of using the fly-by-wire system as a means of creating the illusion of only being able to fly forward, accelerate backwards, or even contribute to my forward acceleration in tandem with my main thruster?

Since this implies using the same thrusters meant for mouse aiming to also move the ship with keyboard commands, etc.? If only the first and second cases are true, what happens if my mouse movement is telling my thruster to point one way and my keyboard is telling it to point another way (assuming I want to use the side thrusters to perform lateral maneuvers)?

this is something which I have [posted on the official forums](http://www.robertsspaceindustries.com/forum/showthread.php?14607-Call-Signs) but given that I had the idea while browsing reddit I thought it deserved a post here.

One thing that quite often gets to me in games is an inability to change my in game user name. And in a lot of instances I can understand why this may be but I got to thinking about call-signs today when someone was talking about the naming of jump points.

What I am suggesting is to allow for the separation between your characters given name verses your characters pilot call sign.

I propose 3 types of in game identification.

**1) Call sign:**

Completely mutable

**2) Character name:**

Immutable

**3) Ship unique hardware IDs:**

A semi-permanent aspect of a ship. Players will be able to scan other people's ships and see their unique hardware IDs for that ship. Call signs seen piloting that ship can be tagged. That way if you scan a ship and get its hardware ID
However if a player can obtain a new ship ID then they can ""clean"" the ship. This hardware ID should be hard to obtain.

I'm cruising around in my slightly modified 315p

There's a pirate at range closing fast. I flare up my thrusters in an attempt to run. They begin shooting but luckily my shields are holding for now. They're still getting closer and I try evasive actions but they stay on my tail. It's clear based on how they're firing they aren't out to destroy me and likely just want to capture my ship. The shots are focused on my engine. 

At this point I know I won't be able to escape by running and I don't have the offensive capability with this ship to defeat them if I turn around and try to fight head to head. What if I make it seem like they scored a good hit on me and knocked out my power... I quickly make some adjustments as I continue evasive actions. I wait for a shot to land near my engine and then dial back my powerplant and kill the main thruster. It appears that I'm dead in the water. 

They seize fire and begin approaching to board my ship. I prepare all my +z facing thrusters to fire at once and turn off the safeties on my missiles. As the pirates pull up next to my ship I trip my thrusters

In order for something like this to work I would need to be able to do a few things with my ship:

* The powerplant/grid need to have variable outputs
* Thrusters have to be individually controllable and queue-able
* Missiles must be able to fire without a lock

Now this is just one example of unconventional tactics that I'd like to see possible but there are many more possibilities. The key to making something like this be able to happen is to allow a lot of custom control over different parts of our ships.

**TL;DR** My purpose in making this post is twofold; I'm curious as to the opinions of the rest of you in regard to unconventional encounters and also I want to see how much of this is already announced as being possible based on known features.

*EDIT: So apparently a scenario like this won't happen. Sensors will be able to tell whether or not I'm truly disabled and more importantly there's no reason to even attempt not to blow up my ship since it's a single crewed vessel.*

1. Cargo Jettison/ Kamikaze

Let's say you're running some sort of unstable weaponry to a buyer and a couple of pirates jump into your system. Let us also assume your ship, and explode. To make up for it you plunder their ships and file insurance for lost cargo due to an attack. On the other end of it, let's say you are attacking a large carrier ship and it's about to blow up, your shields are down and you aren't going to make it out of this fight, so you slam into the carrier(assume we are carrying the same reactive cargo) and blow it up, assuring victory for your team.

2. Wormhole Ambush

You are on a giant mining ship containing a massive and powerful mining laser when you get warning from a friend that a squad of pirates is moving towards the wormhole into the system you are in. You quickly turn to face the wormhole and divert all power to your mining laser. On your friend's signal you fire into the wormhole. The pirates warp into your system just in time to catch the full force of your mining laser

Here's a wiki page on [Basic fighter maneuvers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_fighter_maneuvers) to get started. From reading through this, and high-g barrel rolls would still apply, but a lot of the maneuvers rely on gravity to work. For instance, the whole idea behind a split-s is to trade altitude for speed to disengage.

So it looks like we'll have to come up with at least some of our own. A lot will obviously depend on the ships themselves.

Secondly, pirates).  Passive detection relies on simply detecting the radiation emitted by the enemies search or fire-control radars without emitting your own signal.  The benefit of this system is a reduction in your chances for being detected, whether it be to sit back and watch a powerful fleet pass by, getting away from trouble, or getting the jump on an unexpected enemy.

A full tank on a ship like an Aurora will be cheaper than a Constellation. 2. Maintenance fees and repair fees will be significantly different between sizes of ships.

B. Early game will be filled with explorers, isn't getting a larger ship akin to putting a large ""kill me sign"" on my back? Again, I am assuming two things: 1. There will be swarms of smaller ships but far fewer larger ships which, in my mind, will naturally cause other players to focus on the larger ships 2. 3-5 smaller ships could match a larger ship solo?

Of the three bottlenecks he mentions above - **internet bandwidth**

For example, the maximum number of players one instance can support has risen to 500, or even 1000. Alternatively, if the real limitation is internet bandwidth... well, the way things are going, 4 years from now there might be a maximum of 20 people in one instance!!

EDIT: the thread is really worth reading through

--------

**OP**

As I see a lot of  discussion about Joysticks and which one to use and how to map the axes, thus the Stick seems the natural choice of control method for most people here.

 

Coming kind of freshly with rather negative impressions from the overall fail that was Black Prophecy I’d like to arise this pretty important question for the multiplayer part of the game. What direction is mouse control going to be? Black Prophecy did a lot of things wrong in the controls department and I’d hate to see Star Citizen repeat the same mistakes.

 

One might ask what the problems are, the farther away from the center that cursor is the faster the ship will turn, weapons still fire towards the crosshair in the center of the screen.  As soon as the new kids, that never saw X-Wing and Wing Commander or any serious simulator for that matter, but started with Freelancer and X, jump in they will start to whine that the mouse controls are rather unintuitive, since they are used to weapons firing where the cursor points.

In the single player world all would be fine

 

Now here’s the fatal approach Reakktor took with Black Prophecy as a reaction to those rather loud outcries about mouse control: They gave in and made it pseudo turret control which instantly gave a HUGE precision and possible firing angle advantage to mouse players over joystick players.  I think most of you will agree that in a competitive multiplayer environment having an imbalance on the level of control schemes automatically makes the control scheme with the disadvantage an obsolete choice. They then tried to even the odds by emulating the mouse control with the joystick (which was fail by design since digital joystick axes only send 256 destinct position signals

The conclusion and at the same time suggestion towards Chris and the team is: While with some practice it is perfectly possible to perfrom just as good with a mouse that emulates the stick as a player with a stick. The other way around it is impossible due to hardware limitations to reach thea same performance with a stick that emulates mouse controls as with the mouse control using turreted weapons. So please either go with Joystick and Mouse

------
**TLDR; FPS-esque style mouse control ala Freelancer gives a distinct advantage in accuracy and field of fire to mouse users because the guns follow the cursor; joystick users are pretty much stuck with forward firing guns while they wait for their ship to come around. How to balance this?**",self,t5_2v94d,1353556242.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13loqm/joystick_vs_mouse_control_balancing_issues_really/

I can make the kessel run in less than ten parsecs? I can pull up if it’s a trap??

* Do you think what they are trying to create is realistic and achievable by a smaller team of 30 - 50 in the given time frame?   

I've seen a lot of titles with a lot of promise (Vanguard comes to mind

* Are the ships that are available to the pre-order/Kickstarter/contribution folks something that will be available in the game at release or only to those people that paid?    Will there be bigger/better ships than the Kickstarter stuff?

I'd seriously consider going for a RSI Constellation

* Anyone that went for the Constellation

* How long will the pre-order packages be available through the RSI website?  (if such a time has even been announced)

* I saw it mentioned you will be able to hire NPC crew members for ships that have crew slots.   Presumably this would mean an NPC could control the turret on the Constellation

Basically.... Most games have a gameplay where you have a fixed number of hit points, you die. Eve online has this system, World of Tanks does, as well as most MMOs.

However, you're still in space, even if you took a gazillion damage to your wing - since it's not a crucial system for you to survive, there's no reason for you to stop playing!

The second system is of course a more realistic one. In my head it also sounds as the more fun one; if you destroy a ship's life support system

The devs stated that each engine is not a linear representation of the total force being applied, please feel free to post them. 

I used the spreadsheet format and data from /u/dace 's original spreadsheet for simplicity sake. All credit on that portion of the spreadsheet goes to /u/dace. The new calculations are on a second sheet

A quick rundown of what I did: I took each engine and converted it to a numerical value representing the total force being applied. Ex: a TR1 puts out 1 ton of force. 2 TR1s put out 2x1=2 tons of force. etc...

I then took the total force being put out by the ship and divided it by the total mass of the ship

If we use the Aurora as the ""standard"" by which to judge the other ships, and everything else being a multiple of 1. (Ex: The Aurora LX is 1.5 Aurora acceleration units, meaning it should, in theory, accelerate 50% faster than the Aurora)

Keep in mind that these numbers are *wrong*

[That said

*edit: I've updated the spreadsheet to include the hypothetical speed of the available ships while under full cargo load (The p52 has no cargo capacity). *Keep in mind

*edit2: **I've included a screenshot for mobile devices / other devices which might not display this spreadsheet very clearly.** [Here is the link](http://i.imgur.com/McieOj0.png)

*edit3: Just to clarify: This sheet does NOT represent each ships top speed. This is a chart showing the relative acceleration rates of each ship compared to the Aurora. If the aurora is a Ford Focus, for example, the 350r to have 164.7% better acceleration. 

If we think of the Aurora as the the 2012 Ford Focus SE (0-60 time of 15.7 seconds), and the p52 an astronomical 1.92 seconds, a full half second faster than the Bugatti Veyron super sport.

1359417772.0,17gmnh,Shield Tech Ideas,Consili,19,3,22,"How do we think shields are going to be implemented in Star Citizen? The way I see it there could be two core models for how shield generators are going to work specifically. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Percentage model:**

This is like a traditional health model. Shields will have 100% energy

1)	The shield stays down for the duration of combat

2)	The shield is operating on an overheat mechanic and will regenerate after a cool-down.

**Mods under Percentage model:**

* Capacity (number of hit points)
* Heatsinks (cool down time after overheating)
* High heat alloy (Reduced odds of overheat damage)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Overload model:**

In this model rather than having a percentage of hit points that are depleted

The way I envision this working is that any given shield generator is able to output a certain number of energy units per second. For example say a fighter shield has a capacity of 100 units and can regenerate at 20 units per second. 

Impacts from objects and weapons fire need to be able to take away those energy units faster than the shield generator can regenerate them

**Mods under Overload model:**

* Generator (dictates output rate of energy units)
* Capacity (represents maximum energy unit pool)
* Heatsinks (dictates cool down time after overheating)
* High heat alloy (affects odds of overheat damage)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think that the overload model would be a better way to go as it reduces certain more silly circumstances

Both shield models of course are compatible with the concept of having multiple shield generators in larger ships so you could still have situations where you had managed to drop the shields on the starboard side of a target whist the target still retained shields over the other aspects of the hull. 


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Override mechanic:**

Another thought I have had looks to Mech Warrior Online for inspiration. Heat managment is at the core of gameplay there and whilst they dont have shields, for weapons and shields. 

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dump webs:**

Another idea which I cant claim to have come up with myself is that of Dump webs. Has anyone here read the Commonwealth Saga by Peter F Hamilton? The basic idea of this bit of tech was that you hit a shield with a device that would rapidly absorb shield energy. This energy would go into a large capacitor in the case of small shields

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I think this would be a neat kind of tech to incorporate into Star Citizen.  There would obviously have to be classes of dump webs. A web rated to handle the output of a fighter shield

I can imagine ships doing a fly over of a carrier, firing a projectile which opens out into a web on impact with a smaller ship to start stressing the shields. I guess I am thinking about this as a kind of DPS alternative to EMP devices which are burst damage. 

Having Dump webs in Star Citizen could also add to the responsibility of a carrier’s fighters in a battle. Fighters would need to pick off the dump webs that ships have deployed

You could also just be magicked back to life at a nearby space station with no explanation, which IMO is better than forcing in a flimsy and poorly fitting justification that would weaken the overall integrity of the fictional universe.

But what if you didn't have to die at all? It's already been said that when your ship blows you'll be ejected into space

Suits could be made well armoured and highly resistant to gunfire, and a tough, opaque emergency visor would automatically seal the helmet if the glass breaks.

Incapacitation and subsequent jettisoning would mean hospital bills and suit repair/replacement would need to be paid upon rescue, non-immersion breaking game mechanic. Furthermore, the three mechanics of incapacitation by pain, incapacitation by trauma, and incapacitation by loss of helmet integrity open up a lot of design space that the developers could choose to explore (or not). If they wanted to have a straightforward, hp-based combat system, that would be easy to implement, I have some more ideas.

Perhaps the emergency visor has a pair of tiny 1x3cm windows that allow for minimal vision, or properly equipped starship, but pain would be transient, fading over time to a baseline determined by the level of trauma. Advanced suits could be customized with (expensive) consumable combat injections, like painkillers which reduce pain to keep you from passing out, but make your aim wobble and your movement sluggish. Adrenaline injections could briefly reduce pain and increase speed, but cause a ""crash"" after ~30 seconds severely reducing combat effectiveness. Illegal stimulants could have more powerful and more dangerous effects.

* A huge universe

Now obviously there will be a tutorial, months, years even). Google helps alleviate some of the burden of knowledge, but I see a lot of potential in a mentor system. From my own experience in games like the X Series I feel that space sims in particular can be incredibly intimidating to new players, but also more experienced users that try to get into the more complex layers of the game.

---

Some of the **elements** I had thought of:

* Let players create **""Support Tickets""** ingame that can be filled out like a common support form of companies

* On the same note, which would appeal to other experienced players. These listings should stay up for a much longer time, since we're talking about specialized needs that may not get satisfied easily.

* Implement a **reward system** for good and active mentors that classifies them into different fields AND grades of knowledge. (Maybe displayable titles as well

* Set a specific **minimum level/game time/currency requirement for mentors**

* Further incentives for tutoring could be **percentage-based boosts** to income (or other game elements) for a short time, you name it. Just make sure it's both worth the time the mentor puts into it and yet repels potential abuse.

* Elements that would greatly benefit tutoring would be **Voice over IP**

-----

A system like this, human driven tutorial and general information network, while simultaneously turning knowledge into another tradeable resource for more experienced players, and especially for those with a very high level of expertise in certain game aspects.

This implementation could also **greatly benefit the grade of immersion

*So. What do you guys think? Does this make any sense to you (especially how important I think this is) and,,False,self,t5_2v94d,1352486777.0,,True

I want this to be a discussion thread
The last part is a directly copypasta from Mordeth_Kai's post in the RSI forum.

## Asteroid Mining
The very first stage of asteroid mining would be to work for NPCs
After you can afford your own builder unit, portable base for mining and defense. You would need materials to build the base, of course, but the expenses to keep continuing mining could go in fuel, repair the drill, and any damage that happens to the buildings and the builder unit.

The ores and gas you extract from the asteroid will still be raw
Others can attack your base and raid it for a certain percentage of what you’ve earned

The way I saw it is that you have stores controlled by NPCs where you sell and buy different materials, sort of like an auction house, however, you need to travel to these places which means you need to decide on your best judgment whether it would be worth travelling to the store that buys or sells for the best prices. This also creates different markets for each galaxy, and traffic for those who owns a jump point.

Miners sell their raw materials to mining companies where they extract and convert them to processed materials

When it comes to transport, protection and so forth. There should be some public statistics for how much success the players have in delivering the goods, where the value is taking into account aswell.
The players who transport goods should not have access to the inventory, but the public statistics should mitigate the distrust to the transporters. Though there could be hard for a newcomer to earn trust from those who buys such services.

## Dynamic Ship Design &amp; Construction
The vision I have for this would be to design the individual ship components then piece the ship together allowing for a variety of different components with their own pro’s and con’s in the development. Each component would have a size class associated with it so that a player doesn’t mix engines from a huge ship on a tiny fighter thats 1/4 its size. Basic ideas for the components would be the cockpit, weapons, power source, and various ship systems. Each component would be given a size and weight factor as well as power draw, so that a ship design will be limited by its power source, and the weight of all the equipment balanced against the ships engines to determine speed and maneuverability. To truly spice it up, a component research system that will allow individual players to have their own unique ship parts (as far as stats go). By this I mean, and based on the materials used a component will come up with random stats done by a R&amp;D computer with components being expended to create new designs. For example you might combine toss in 2 different materials to create a power source, weight

* The way I see it is you get the game and you'll be able to earn all the ships through playing the game anyhow.

* LTI really won’t be all that valuable and you can’t get it anymore anyway.

* Most of the ships are going to have other variants that you’ll end up getting later in any case.

So other than getting a cool ship on the first day is there any reason I should buy something like the 325a on top of the basic package? (I’m probably going to die horribly very quickly anyhow. I used to go through a bil worth of ships in a day of playing eve).

Someone who's skilled at escape will have no problem ditching a sub-par scanning ship pilot and they're less likely to be found in the first place if they've made good off-grid hiding spots outside of common traffic lanes. Likewise a skilled scanner who's quick with the scanning tools will have no problem pinning down the average pilot quickly. People of similar skill levels could have some pretty intense cat-and-mouse sessions.

We are hearing more and more about Star Citizen through multiple avenues. Lore, was that planets were bland and rather tiny. 

The first thing is that I would like to see planets on a decent scale, dwarfing anything else in the system and becoming more dangerous as players went within a certain range. 

I can envisage taking a fight nearer to planets or stars to raise the stakes, but the risk it poses could still be implemented as an improved version of what Freelancer showed.

The battle is over and we - PC gamers, Lancers and the rest - have won. You've not only met every goal we set, you've exceeded them. Star Citizen will be released because of your dedication and your willingness to put your money where our mouths are. Our gratitude is immeasurable; we owe you our livelihoods and will not soon forget it.

The question is: what happens next?

Our intention has always been to make Roberts Space Industries YOUR site. It's not a public advertisement for the game; it's a private community for those who are making the game happen. We want your input on what we're doing and we want to share our plans with you; the occasional passer-by doesn't concern us. The plan was initially to immediately switch on a wall that would allow only you, which may take up to two weeks, otherwise we would be blocking thousands of backers from participating.

Updates and features will continue, wives, children and yes, pets, miss us!) We will also be launching new sections which have been in the works for some time: the Galactapedia will tell you more about the Star Citizen world, Engineering will introduce you to game mechanics that are being planned and Holovids will offer you video footage from the game as it takes shape.

What about pledges? Good news: those of you who got in on the ground floor are covered. Your ships have lifetime insurance policies and for the next year you will have the ability to purchase further tiers or upgrade existing ones at the initial prices. That's not true of everyone else: if you want to back Star Citizen and participate in this amazing community, for example.)

One issue which concerns us is what to do with the funding tracker. So we're going to throw the issue up to you: in two weeks, remove it or put it somewhere else? We'll let the community decide.

We also have previously outlined the 'behind the screens' subscription plans available now. They're designed for users who simply want to give us a little extra support during the development - you're getting the whole story

We can't thank you enough for everything you've done for this project. Please see the next update on 'The Pledge' for our promise to you. The next two years are going to be incredible for all involved and we're thoroughly happy that all of you are along for this exciting ride.",self,t5_2v94d,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/13gpqx/rsi_postcampaign_text_wall/

Hi Michael
As the quad package is digital you can opt in for the citizen cards when the shipping form comes out so thats no problem.
Yes your gifting recipients will absolutely be able to upgrade and tinker with their baskets with all the perks of early pledgers.
Hope this helps.

If character customization options (I’m talking the physical appearance of your character) doesn’t suck

In WoW I successfully ran an information brokerage, and trading information for in-game currency. At first I was doing the footwork myself, but later grew my guild and had many spies working for me. I would negotiate contracts with the customers, then assign and pay my people to gather the intel. At the height of our success we were making plenty of gold and having a pronounced effect on the politics and inter-guild relationships within the RP community. We planted moles everywhere, hired mercenaries for protection, and I’m positive it can be done again.  At its dirtiest, we matched clients with assassins to carry out wetwork. I swear just reading the feature list for this game I can already tell that all of this and more will be possible in Star Citizen.

* Can you imagine the value of a planned trade route that a mercantile clan is going to take through low security space to a pirate gang?

* What do you think a bounty hunter type player will pay for solid intel on where their target likes to hang out or who their friends are?

* That law enforcement guild (trust me

Personally I would kill to see several large clans at war, and awesome space combat that might result. I’ve never played EVE Online but I’ve always been jealous of how they were able to make an actual impact on their game world (way more so than WoW at least). I know in EVE that there’s all kinds of corporate espionage, scamming, and vicious backstabbing, and I expect we’ll see some of that in this game, but probably not prevalent.",,self,,

As far as I know

just seeing what is going on inside the ship's bridge/control room wouldn't be as playable/fun as the 3rd person view. Being in a bigger ship and fighting another player while sitting in the captain's chair: I don't think this works. So how can 3rd person be kept without breaking true space-sim immersion?

1. **camera drone**. A little thingy, but probable itself become unrealistic (drone following through jumppoints? what happens when destroyed? moving as fast as ship? having to be refueled? etc.)

Please don’t take this post as some entitled gimme gimme post. It’s simply a fun idea that I hope is good enough that some dev might throw it in a file to use later.

Chris Roberts has said he’s a fan of other games like Dark Souls’s multiplayer features. I have not played it myself yet

These devices would be of varying quality and sophistication, and other players could locate it (by scanning) and read the message. These messages could be anything; warnings about pirate activity, other dangers, decoys, and traps.

Perhaps they could also broadcast to a more targeted group with encryption, equipment could be used to hack and retrieve the encrypted messages (or edit them). Hacked buoys might fool some people and not others, depending on the quality of their scanning equipment and how smart the pilot is.

Decoy beacons could broadcast fake ship signatures to make it appear (as an electronic reading) that a ship was there. Decoys could also fool some types of missiles (obviously an image recognition missile isn’t going to be fooled by an electronic signature

I think it’s obvious how interesting and exciting things could get with this type of mechanic in the game. It makes scanning equipment very important, and who knows what else.

To summarize


Quick summary:

Message Buoys can broadcast messages

Decoys can broadcast fake electronic ship signatures for tricks and ECM.

On to my question: The kickstarter page clearly says ""No Pay to Win""

**Edit:** It seems I sparked a discussion about ""what exactly Pay to Win means"". This was not intentional.

P2W isn't 1 specific model. P2W isn't inherently bad. I wasn't judging the decision to use this as means of funding the game.

P2W in its purest form means ""Money = Advantage"" in any way

I want to make clear I am a fan of ""grind reducing""-purchases like how eve works where you can get isk by buying ingame plexes

The reason this works in eve is because the game works in such a way that once you've progressed enough, but won't be possible through the monthly-cap system Star Citizen will have).

~~Lastly are these ship prices going to remain at their level when the game comes out?

**TLDR: Make planetary combat instances accessible via mission taken from planet/space-station**

As cool as it would be to fly directly from space into a planets atmosphere and do tasks/missions similar to that of Star Wars: Rogue Squadron

My workaround for this would be to have something similar to instances in mmo's. Basically you pick up the mission from the planet and instead of leaving for space from the docking bay

Now there will have to be some function to keep the player from leaving the mission zone, it simply warps them out of the instance. Spawning them just outside of the flyable zones in the persistent world of space around the planet.

Now, but I can't really think of a way to incorporate that as the enemy player would first have to make it into the opposing forces airspace. And they would have no incentive to go there because what is happening is instanced, thus it has no real impact on the persistent universe.
