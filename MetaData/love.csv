1366355097.0,1co0cb,The most beautiful true love story I have ever heard. This came from eavesdropping on 2 old men. I've never heard of such adoration and respect. I pray I can find something similar.,tywtly,177,20,13,"I was in the coffee shop on my college campus studying when two older men came in and sat down on the other side of the room. One of the men started talking about his wife

""Man...I was 21 when I met her. I saw her from across the room and brother.....didn't nobody have to tell me who she was. I said 'there goes my wife', I'd go and work for 12 hours and when I came home, she had dinner on the table waiting on me. After the kids were asleep, we were both so tired that we would go straight to bed just so we could hold each other. I was always content knowing that she was right there in my arms. I told her every night that as long as she was there, I was just fine. She was my queen, man. I told her that every day, she was the queen of my whole life. And my queen pushed me all the time to be the man I needed to be. She pushed me to seek God and follow Him and love Him with my whole heart, and you can ask my little girls and they'll tell ya

Well, because everybody gets sick sometimes. But the doctors seemed to think it was something we should worry about. Well brother, they were right. She asked me if I would marry anyone else if she died. She worried about it. she couldn't imagine me being with another woman. I told her I could never have a second queen. But ya know what? She didn't believe me! That girl looked me in the eyes and said 'I know you better than that! You're the kind of man who needs a woman by his side. You couldn't be happy alone!'

I looked her straight back in those big brown eyes and I said 'sugar

Well, I would work 12 hours a day, and I would come home. I would carry my wife out of bed and bring her to the table. I would cook dinner with her sitting there watching me, and we would just talk like nothing ever changed. Sometimes, we would sit and eat together and smile and just be happy that we could look at each other. On the bad days, I would feed her and she would cry and apologize, but I told her it was what I was there for. She was so sick, it was every 4 hours. So once we ate, it didn't matter what was going on

There was a long silence

""But the body can only handle so much, and so did she. We both knew she wasn't coming back from it. But it still felt like it came outta nowhere. I mean....one day she's there in my arms, and the next day she's gone. It killed me at first, but it didn't take too long before I realized that she really was better off. She didn't have to take no more medicine, she didn't have to eat no more of my nasty cooking, all she had to worry about now was praising the Lord! 

Ya know what still gets me though? Man, and her side of the bed is just how she left it. I wanna believe she's still here. My daughters tell me I should get it out of there and fix the place up, but I spent my life in that house with her. It's still our home, as far as I'm concerned.""

Silence again overtook the room. None of us had ever heard a man speak with such absolute respect and admiration. It was obvious that he had truly loved and adored that woman

The other old man broke the silence and said ""Man

A smile crept across the old man's face. His entire face lit up and he said

1352075679.0,12n1c1,Have you ever missed someone so much it hurt?,IWontDance,85,24,17,"	
Have you ever missed someone so much that it hurt? And I’m not
talking normal hurt. I’m not talking about that feeling in your gut when
 you think about what you miss. That little sigh
here. No. I’m talking about physical pain. Missing someone so badly 
that your stomach aches
frustrated that you could hit someone
 think about them and how far away they are from you. I’m talking 
about missing someone so much that one thought or memory of them
 can cause you to smile, all at the same time. I’m 
talking about when you miss them so much that you want to keep 
thinking of them
 afraid that if they’re gone too long you might forget
thinking of them so you miss them more. Because missing them makes
 you think of them. You’re so afraid that you may lose what you’re 
feeling. You know that the feelings you have are so true
 real
that’s left of you. Leaving a shell of who you used to be
 You know that it’s dangerous to miss them this much. It could hurt 
you
 because hurting them would surely be the worst thing you can 
possibly imagine. But despite your fears
 feelings you have could ruin you
 Clinging to them. 
	
You do this for one reason.
	
Because these feelings are all you have left of the person you miss. They’re gone, or possibly 
forever. It doesn’t matter which. But you miss everything about them
 and you want to keep missing them. You want to keep hurting 
because it makes you remember them. 
	
And you do this because you know the moment you stop having
 these feelings; the moment you don’t think of them the moment you 
wake up
moment that happens
hurting you might forget them. They might fade into your memory.
They could become just another person you used to know. Another
 blurry memory without definition. Their importance could fade into the
 background. You’re so afraid that you might forget the way they 
looked
 enough for me
 smiled
way their lips formed a smile
they grinned. You’ll forge the way they sounded. The way their laugh
 tasted
and so happy that you thought nothing could ever stop you from 
smiling. The way their hands felt in yours. The way their body felt
 against yours; the way it was so warm
 like nothing could touch you as long as you were in their arms. You 
might forget how their body moved when they walked or dance
or sat. How their mouth formed each syllable they spoke. The way 
their lips felt against yours. The stupid quirks that they had that 
somehow drove you crazy
thought possible. 
	
What if you forgot it? What if you forgot all of it? What if one 
day you woke up and you couldn’t remember the way they made you 
feel? What could you do? They were gone
move on. 
	
But moving on is the last thing on your mind. 
	
Because you love them. 
	
There has never been a truer feeling in your heart and soul than 
the feeling you have for this person. They literally mean the world to 
you. You can’t imagine life without them. And you can’t remember life 
before them. When you met them you knew that they were a knew 
person
entire life. You feel so utterly comfortable around them that you would 
tell them your deepest secrets
so desired to hear them. You could tell them and not have a second 
thought; because despite the fact that you just met them
trusted them wholeheartedly. Traits that they possess that you would 
despise in another person are bearable
see the world in a whole new way because of them. The moment they 
stepped into your life the meaning of it changed. A new course was 
set for you that fateful moment
	
You love them. So you miss them. And you hurt for them. You 
would probably die for them. So this pain of longing isn’t so bad after 
all. Considering what you would do for them
you. You let the pain take you over once in a while. You give into the 
tears and the pain. You cry for hours even
But it’s worth every second of hurt. Because for all the pain you 
endure for them
when you’re with them
again
you know if you let yourself stop missing them you’ll forget. And 
forgetting them means forgetting the way they make you feel. It 
means forgetting love. And love is never something to give up on. 
	
Missing them means you remember them. And remembering them 
is all you have left. 
	
It may seem silly to cling to a feeling that hurts so much. After 
all
comes the fear. If you forget all that they were and all they made you 
feel how would you find it again?  You may meet someone who makes 
you happy
compromise. What if you forget and take something less than you had? 
And then what if the one you had comes back
remember. How could one endure? How could you leave the one you 
had settled for
go on after remembering what it was like with the one you really fell 
for?",,t5_2qhnh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/12n1c1/have_you_ever_missed_someone_so_much_it_hurt/

But he's wearing a tuxedo. Made of electric guitars. And bacon.

It was perfect. My bloodflow was instantly redirected southward. I closed my eyes

1348080096.0,105d9k,Love is real.,Nebula15,56,9,12,"So here's my story that I would like to share with all of you:

I met this girl the first week of my freshman year at college. She was a friend of my room mate and she lived on the same floor as my in the dorm. We ended up getting to know each other more and more over the first couple of months of school and by winter time we had gotten extremely close. At the time I met her she was in a relationship with this dude for close to 3 years. He was nearly five years older than her and she would constantly talk to me about how she didn't love him anymore and was looking for a way out of the relationship. I had hung out with the two of them multiple times and though I have nothing against him, I never felt uncomfortable or awkward, we both knew that we were just having our own thoughts. And if one of us had a thought that we wanted to share, we didn't have a problem speaking our minds. This made every conversation we had a meaningful one because we would never just ""shoot the shit"". Although my feelings for her were so intense, I wouldn't dare reveal my secret to her. Her friendship was too valuable to me to put at risk and also we had decided that me her, and another friend of mine were going to share an apartment next year together, so I figured that my shot with her was at this point at a zero percent. She was everything and more that I was looking for in a girl; great sense of humor, insanely smart, I didn't make a move because I didn't want to mess anything up friendship wise/ living arrangements. Summer finally came and I went on a family vacation for the first two weeks of the break. While I was gone

Skip forward 2 weeks. The first night I get home and I hang out with her and a couple mutual friends. She gave me the biggest hug I have ever received the moment I saw her again. She told me multiple times how much she missed me while I was gone. You could't imagine how amazing that felt to hear. The next day we hang out again with the other friend we are going to be sharing an apartment with and find a place to live for the next coming school year in the city. The rest of the day we spent together just the two of us driving around and exploring nearby forest preserves. This day everything just seemed to be clicking. We had the best conversations that day and learned even more about each other. The more I learned about her the more I realized this was the girl that I not only wanted in my life


That was three months ago. We've been dating ever since and now live together as well. Since then she told me that she had started to like me around the same time I had started to like her and that I was part of the reason she decided to end it with her now ex-boyfriend. Damn that felt good to hear. 

Not two weeks after we started dating

This girl makes me feel alive. She makes me feel like life is worth living and every day I get to wake up next to the my favorite person in the world. 

Everyone, I promise you, you don't love them. When you find the person your meant to be with, everyday feels like the happiest day of your life. Don't settle when you can have so much more and don't cut yourself short.

Be patient with the one you love and the universe will let everything fall into place. 

I don't care if people up vote or down vote this. I just needed to share my story. I have found my soul's counterpart and I am truly happy. 

TL;DR: I have found the love of my life and have never been happier.",,t5_2qhnh,1348085872.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/105d9k/love_is_real/

She remained there consistent. Even if our love life was over

One night she got up and forced me to walk in the middle of the night while I was screaming at her because I thought I couldn't do it. She kept on pushing me. Instead of giving up like I did

She step by step gave me my life back. As I am writing this she is besides me sleeping and I am grateful I get to wake up next to such a wonderful human being,always will be. I will always love her.

We went to a little park in my town, by Sandra Boynton. Really cute book. Then I said I had another present, and I gave her a mix CD I made earlier. On it was written ""Will you marry me?"" and as she looked at it I got down on my knee and pulled out the ring. I asked her if she wanted another present, she smiled and said yes, and I popped the question.

1. you can never know exactly what someone else feels

2. you can never change someone else, you cannot force him to come to grips with himself. that is, if there's even something for him to come to grips with. 

and FINALLY 
3. you can't be angry at someone for not loving you the way you love them. people are just people. boys are boys and girls are girls

1333700936.0,rw1ic,A letter to you,,31,3,2,"Dear  You

How have you been?

It’s been a while since we talked last so I’ll try not to talk to fast.

It’s been hard for me not having you around. I keep asking myself why I broke up with you and I can’t come up with a definite answer. Isn’t that funny? I just couldn’t be with you anymore. Something about our relationship didn’t seem right. I can’t tell you what it is because no matter how much I try to pin it down I don’t know what it is

“He was a major part of your life; of course you’ll miss him; it’s perfectly normal. It’s like getting a tooth pulled out; after the dentist pulls it, and sometimes you see yourself missing it terribly. It’s going to take a while, but it always takes some time. Should you have kept the tooth? No, because it was causing you pain. Pulling the tooth was the right decision, but it’s still going to hurt.”

This is how I feel about us. At one point you felt so right in my life. You were a tooth to me. You were part of me that helped me get through my day, when you try to put a tooth you pulled out back in, it’ll stay for a little, but then fall out again because in the end it’s no longer part of you.  And that’s what I tried to do. Put you back in. That putting the tooth I pulled out back in would put things back to normal, but the truth is it doesn’t. Once you pull a tooth out, it’s no longer part of the body, and it stops growing. 

I miss you so much you have no idea. I wake up day after day and you’re the first thing that comes to mind

But in the end it’s called a break up because it’s broken, so I should have stayed out of yours. For that I’m sorry. I really am.

I hope that if this letter ever gets to you

For the past two years you’ve helped me through so many hard times and through so many good ones. You’ll always be a part of me that I’ll never forget. I’m sorry that I’ve tried to put you back in to my life so many times. I should’ve seen that it would just end in heartbreak

I hope that one day you’ll say hi to me and that we can talk about how we’ve been and that I can clear up anything I’ve confused you about. 

Life goes on and we have to go along with it. That’s something that I’m still trying to do with us. I hope that the next guy that steals your heart will be just as amazing as I am and you can be assured that the next girl to steal mine will be just as amazing as you

You have given me love. You showed me how to be so happy that I cried tears of joy; something only you did for me. It’s been said that the greatest kind of love is the one that awakens your soul and makes you reach for more. It plants a fire in your heart and gives you peace in mind. You’ll always be the girl that did that for me, I did that for you. Thank you for everything. Every day I thank whoever runs this universe that you were chose to be my first love and I was chosen to be loved by you. 

Thank you.

Sincerely

Me

I met him as a premedical student while we were in college. I was recently elected to the executive board of your run-of-the-mill student group to do the marketing BS that goes along with it. He was returning to be an exec for his second year. I walked into the room

After that first meeting, did we hit it off. I tried to quell my primal urges......which worked for 4 weeks or so. Then, he invited me out.

A couple of hours of surfing turned into a night at a local bar. And, and several drinks later, we ended up back at my place. That night would kick off 9 months of the steamiest (and most fulfilling) friends-with-benefits situation I had ever even heard about. 

We would meet for parking lot rendezvous in the middle of the day to tear each other's clothes off, but was afraid to tamper with the sanctity of the friends-with-bennies unstated agreement (you know the one), so I remained silent. Little did I know, he was sworn to secrecy for the exact same reasons. 

After months of choking down my desires and desperately searching for any sign of reciprocity, and--most importantly--spoke with conviction about how he felt. Assuming that my ""friend"" was fine with remaining as such, I made it official with the new man. 

Only a couple of days after the facebook status went active, and that if he had known that I would be receptive to having a romantic connection, he would have been the first to jump in line. 

I was crushed. I sat on my floor and cried. And, we sat on the cliffs of the beach, drank bourbon, and let all of the pent up, emotional angst come out. At sunset, when I couldn't take it anymore, I kissed him. A deep

I know...I know... You're thinking

Yeah...yeah I am. 

I suppose I was shy around him. How could I trust that he'd be open with me from now on

Anyway, I'd moved to the opposite coast, and we were both in relationships. 

(Here's the good part!)

One day I was reflecting on my impending medical school applications. I remembered all of the folks I started the journey with and was curious as to who had made it through. After going through my phone, I gave him a call. 

The phone rang forever, but BANG instant chemistry.

We promised to talk again, it would. 

Well, and sweet embracing. It was a love shit show. 

To make a long story longer, I love him, and it's disgustingly, absurdly amazing. He's moving out here to live with me prior to the start of his medical school (yes, he got in! yay!) so that we can make a good go at things. Depending upon how it goes, my own medical school location will probably be dictated on, within reason

I write this note because I am in love with one of the most amazing girls in this world. Yet she does not love me back. I write because I love her so much that it drives me insane and I have no other emotional outlet.

I long to be with her. Just being near her makes my heart do backflips. It makes me feel....so alive. More alive than I could ever imagine. We could be just sitting in an empty closet together and we wouldn't have to do or say a single thing. And I would just melt in every second of perfect bliss. Simply because she's just in the room.

I long to hold her in my arms and feel her body so close to mine. Her heart beating against my chest while I fight the urge to never let her go. Her beautiful eyes gazing into mine as I kiss her gently. In my mind that would make me the luckiest man to ever live.

I dream of the day where I can hold her in my arms and call her mine. And be there for her. All the time. Not because I have to

But I'm an idiot. I can't spend time with her without later regretting doing or not doing certain things. I can never seem to give her the most amazing time that I know I'm capable of giving her. I cannot just open up and be myself. My love for her gets in the way of my ability to show her how great we would be together. And that tears me apart. It rips me to shreds. It eats away at my mind day and night. And that just makes me love her even more. It's torturous that I cannot be with the love of my life.

She is my weakness. She confuses me and then I confuse myself even more by thinking about it too much. I hate not knowing how she feels about me.

There was something about her, and she started bringing the old me back out. It was wonderful, I loved her, but i was too nervous to ask her out. Soon she was taken from me, I had waited too long, someone else had asked her out and she hardly ever saw me again.

I had dropped harder than ever before, I didn't want to live anymore. Nothing was ever going right, things only got worse, and I didn't want to live in it anymore. I was walking along a bridge, and thought about jumping off, when I received a text message, it was from her, and she had said that she missed me

At the end of the night, and how it's ending around the same time we are graduating/ getting close to graduating. She said that every good movie has to end, and she was watching one right then, she said that it was about a young girl texting this amazing, sweet boy, but was getting so tired she couldnt focus any more.

This event made me man up and finally ask her out, and at the end of the story, it would open a file hidden on the jump drive containing the story of a teddy beat holding a heart, and in French, it said ""Kira, will you go out with me?"" i had given it to her on a Friday, and was nervously awaiting a reply, I finally got a reply saying that she would love to go out with me

We went to the movies, and she is allergic to wheat, so her choices for food are extremely limited, but that was no worry to me, I would learn to deal with anything for her. It was the best night of my life, going on a date with the girl I've loves for a year and a half now, nothing could get better.

It wasn't a week later that I decided to ask her if we could be Facebook official, I had payed for the entire night out, but it was worth it at the end of the night because I loved her, and I would have done anything for her, and she thought it was just as friends... I was not myself since that point.

A year and a half later, and saved me from being a highschool drop out, smoking and drinking and partying. I graduated highschool, and planned on moving to Oregon for college a week later. 

At my going away party, eventually her and I ended up kissing, the best thing that has ever happened in my life. She had flashed me that same night, but the kiss was the most important event, nothing else mattered but that. I wanted her to come with me, but she had college there, and her family

Moving to Oregon was achieved through the use of cars, I decided to check Facebook when I see it, the worst thing that I had ever seen, it said ""Kira is in a relationship to John Doe (not actual name)"" my heart stopped beating, I couldn't breath, I couldn't think, I couldn't do anything. I was a statue, and she is in a relationship with some guy, and how it took a lot for him to ask her out

After reaching Oregon, I see it every day when I sit at my computer, and I think of her, and how much I love her, she means everything to me, and even though she is with another guy, she's happy

I went months, whatever you want to call it. As lonely as it was, I was determined to be happy. Determined to not care about the opposite sex, and to stay away from relationships and all the hurt that came along with them.
One night, and didn't want to be out late, so I agree'd as long as we only stayed for a few hours I'd go. 
So we get there, before I even walk through the door completely, was the one I'd been searching for. I couldn't help but stare, and almost instantly was caught. They looked right back at me, and I don't know if it was just me, but there was something there right from that first glance. We then proceeded to introduce ourselves, and spend the entire night hanging out. They didn't mind that I decided to not drink and be the DD of the night, I almost got smashed in the head with a bottle. Windows broken
The next day I added them on facebook, every day for a week, just waiting. Then finally I gathered up the balls to message them. At first their responses came very slowly, and seemed uninterested, but as a little time went on, they started starting the conversations, and trying to make plans. We'd hang out every once in a while, so saying yes to crashing at my place was sort of me trying to see if they felt the same.
we cuddled all night, and it was absolutely breathe taking. We did nothing more then hold each other, play-wrestle, and laugh. It was such a perfect night. 
The next day was the big day. We started dating, convinced myself I had all I needed. Never once would I have believed you if you were to tell me that I'd fall in love just by one glance. Love at first sight was a myth. Things did not happen that way, until that night. The night I almost missed because of a stupid interview. The night I was close to skipping out on because I was all comfy-cozy in my bed when asked to go. The night that changed my entire outlook on the world. I'm here now, with the person I belong with, happy, and completely content with life.

Then, again just as friends out of curiosity. Only, after we'd fully freaked each other out, he said ""you know, now would be the perfect time to make a move if we liked each other."" But I still didn't see him that way, and I thought it was probably the adrenaline tricking me into liking him a little more than usual. He came to a party that my [now ex] boyfriend and I were throwing for St. Patrick's Day and we were attached all night, couldn't stop talking. Drunk gossiping about friends and past relationships, I have a boyfriend who I thought that I loved very much. 

I chose to break up with my boyfriend because of some brewing issues with jealousy and because we really had nothing in common and usually sat around and did nothing and said nothing whenever we were together. My friend helped me through everything, we were learning more and more that we were perfect for each other. Who knew that there was someone out there who liked all the same music, and movies, and foods as I did. Someone who liked to have the same kind of intellectual conversations as me. Someone who'd been looking for the same thing I'd been looking for all along.

I had never looked into someones eyes and seen what I see in his. Now that we've been seeing each other

I learned you had been having poor luck with some guys (they were idiots to let you go). I think it was then you asked me my opinion on dating with age differences. I told you it honestly, but damn, I don't think I ever wanted to tell you how I felt more than I did right then. But we both know I couldn't... I had a girlfriend at the time. So we continued talking, and I realized how lucky I was to have you as a friend, and you were completely there for me. And then you told me you were considering leaving.

Keep in mind we havent seen each other in a decade.  We talk about anything and everything, understand one another eerily well.  We are both artists and understand the sacrifices/hardships one has to make to maintain this career.  We see eye to eye and have a profound trust that feels so natural its almost taken for granted.  We talk on the phone everyday, txt throughout the day, skype when its possible.  We have built a foundation through these means only, and are completely in love with one another.

The one issue is that she lives 2000 miles away!! I am finishing grad school in May and have never been so motivated in my life.  I will see her for the first time in Ten years in December, and I know this.  I love her too.  What do you think?  If all goes as splendidly well as I think it well in December, should I relocate to her state in the name of Love after I graduate?  I have a decent job where I am, but in my field I can go to any major city and do ok.  She is in a great city for the arts by the way, Its just on the other side of the country. Before you say to me, ""whatch out man, you have no idea whats going on"" I will say this:
I am a Trigenarian, ""I do what i Want!! ""  If anyone cares Ill keep you updated on the development of this love story.  My prediction is, I will be married by this time next year, and that sounds perfect to me.  Its game changer time Reddit!

There is nothing within you but raw and perfect emotion. It's an intensely complex thing to consider, yet at the same time it's so incredibly simple. It's really beyond the scope of description, almost beyond comprehension. When you're that perfectly happy, you could be killed right then and there, and you'd welcome it.

We went on the trip, that on the fourth morning of the trip, he explained to me that he was still in love with his ex.  I was hurt, but I didn't think it was going that direction anyway, so we parted ways and haven't spoken since.  It didn't break my heart, but it wasn't a great time.

Fast forward to last week.  I've been dating, I found an ad that I had to respond to, but not in any romantic sense.  I just had to share my story.

The ad was from a man about a year older than me.  His ad sounded a little crazy, that undeniable first time spark.  The ad read just a little too good to be true, and the kicker was that he wanted to take someone he barely knew, but felt he may have good chemistry with, to Hawaii.  To connect.  Sounded familiar.

I couldn't help myself and sent him an email.  I wasn't answering the ad -- I took all of my PTO from work to take that trip (I took the rest of the time off of work

His first email back was LONG.  He basically re-explained what he had said in his ad and asked me a lot of questions.  It was kind of as if he had the impression I was putting myself in the running for the trip.  He included a picture that wasn't exactly my type, I probably would have ran with it if I could have.

We exchanged many more emails, so I called him immediately.  Yes, in hindsight, it was a total stalker move.  We talked for about an hour, and I let him go so I could go get something for dinner.  Before I could leave the house, he called me back and said he really enjoyed our conversation -- could he join me for dinner?  I figured why not, and we met.

When he walked in the door, but we talked way more than we ate, and we didn't leave the restaurant until around midnight.  It was amazing, we had so much in common: interests, neighborhoods, music, beliefs...it was uncanny.  We went back to my house and talked on the couch until 2:00 a.m.  We discovered we shared the same birthday.  We also discovered we really liked kissing each other.  I finally had to kick him out so I could sleep.  We texted for at least another half hour after.

The next day, and he ended up staying over.  Every hour we spend together, we find something else we have in common, or find a difference we can laugh over.  I'm learning so much about him, but it still feels like I've known him forever.

We've decided to throw caution to the wind and see what happens if we forge a relationship.  He's taken his craigslist ad down (I just tried to find it to link here, and we can TALK.

leeching our war-torn hearts from disappointing relationships. I needed a friend. You suddenly found me attractive and worth
speaking to after two or three years of going to the same college, ecetera.
I spent months trying to figure you out

You took me to a party with people I barely knew
side to avoid feeling like an outcast. We played beerpong and won
apartment and cuddled. It wasn't the sex, you shifted onto your side in the middle of night. Before you drifted back to sleep,
you turned and planted the softest kiss on my shoulder. I remember being half awake
by this gesture. I never experienced anything like that before. But something happened at that moment: My body relaxed
I smiled

That was a year ago. You still do the very same thing: Turn over in your sleep
you plant a kiss on some part of my body. It is sincerely my favorite thing that you do. Whenever I feel you stir at night
if I am semi-concious

In your arms
and feel the most comfort I have felt in years. I can feel your chest rise and fall
I can feel your lips on the tip of my head
you didn't hold me firmly to your body. I have never felt any of this. And now I know that this is home. 

Home is not a physical manifestation like a house or a city. Home is a feeling. It is the feeling that your heart is firmly set in 
place
windows or extinguish the power for an hour, it will hold up. If you have the right
tools

I don't want to lose my home. I thought I understood what that was like when I moved away for college four years ago.
However
losing a home until I imagined a place without you. And the thought breaks my heart or threatens to snap it in half. 
And so I am always cleaning house
This is why I still have few nightmares of a girl, but
always cry at the thought of failing. I don't want my foundation to fall apart. 

I know that things may not last. I know not to expect everything for the future. But I can tell you now that the work
I've done is the best I've done in a very long time. Your arms are the only home I need
hope that wherever I go
That will never change.

When I met the first person I fell in love with, even for a broken person like myself. I can't count the times we laughed and danced together, loving each others company. I saw myself having a family with him. He loved children. He was free-spirited and carefree. He seemed to love life. 

But, secretive, and would wave off any problem I felt we needed to discuss. After supporting him after failing out of school, getting a DUI, and even sexually assaulting me, the straw that broke the camel's back after all that time was him not willing to talk through any issue. After countless nights of crying myself to sleep, thinking back on the wonderful times we had, I walked. I had grieved toward the end enough and it wasn't as heartbreaking as one would assume after being with your first love for that long. 

My mother would always tell me that it's okay to end it if you don't think its right. She said there are many men to meet and many will treat you just as well

I met him at a bar, and we commenced talking. We had both taken Japanese in school and drunkingly spoke to each other in it. My co-workers eventually left me alone, seeing that I was preoccupied. I was.

As cynical, I took a plunge because what did I really have to lose? It worked out. No one has been more tender, sweet, endearing, and thoughtful as this man has. His eyes sparkle when he laughs. He looks at me with such tenderness that it melts my heart. He carried a desk someone left on a curb because he knew I needed one without being asked.  I sprained my ankle and he took it on himself to carry me up and down my stairs in my apartment building. He's done my laundry because it was his day off and he simply could. 

I am sorry I am gushing

I don’t know that you quite get it yet.  Maybe you do.  It’s a pretty hard thing to get.

Things so massive that they are impossible to put into the mind have crashed together and warred.  This universe coalesced from the birth and death of galaxies.  We were born from the aether and yet are made from parts of infinite intricacy.  And you doubt that you are beautiful.  You doubt that you are special.  Don’t.

I don’t know what this is all about or what the grand purpose is.  If it even has a grand purpose.  Maybe this whole delicate construction is just a giant music box.  The components will click together and two dancers will rise out of the middle.  The music starts playing.

Because that is what I want.  I want to take you dancing.  I want some grand ballroom where we are in the center of a room full of people and the air smells like fresh-cut wood or peaches or homemade ice cream.

I want to show you a river and see what you look like standing ankle deep on the smooth

I want to get drunk as hell with you in the corner of a bar and hear you go on for hours about something

I want to hold your hand in the house you grew up in. 

I want us to go to an art supply store and pick up things haphazardly

I want to be terrified

I want to get into fights then laugh it off and really forget about it.

And I know you are right there because I have seen you.  I have seen your silhouette on the marquee screens of my dreams.  I have seen your laughter flicker in lamplight reflection off someone else’s eyes.  When I looked for you there

Believe me

I will just have to turn the key on the music box until I see you again.

I realize I'm acting like an idiot, just a really nice genuine guy. Maybe that's what's wrong with me. I'm too nice. I care too much. But is that really a reason to end things with me? Because I'm TOO NICE? That I actually CARE that much about you? I thought that that is what everyone in the world was searching for, someone who genuinely cares about them. I realize it went fast. I should probably have waited to say that ""I love you"" for a later date. 
	I had been thinking that I felt it, and y'know I really don't remember every word of the conversation but I remember asking you if it would be weird if I felt the same way, and you said no. I still didn't say it though. Later on the next week when you were upset, you said that no one LOVED you. There was a short moment of silence, probably only a second or two but a thousand things played in my mind trying to decide if I should say it or not, so I took a chance and said it.
I'm sorry if that freaks you out, take the time to get to know each other more. I still want to be together, have a relationship, but we can absolutely slow it down.
	Now here I am wondering if that can even happen. You seem so upset and torn in your decisions, say the word and we'll do it.
I just don't want that. I don't want to be the guy who makes you feel torn and upset. I want to be the guy that you can talk to about anything
	Someone told me that they think you have feelings for someone else, he sounds like a piece of shit. A guy with 10x the problems I have, hell, 100x, or a 1000x the problems I have. All the shit that you've told me, how could you have ever even looked at him twice? Much less spend that much time with him? God. What's my biggest problem? That I fucking care too much? Oh my god fucking run as far away from me as you can because I fucking care about you. Fuck my life.
I seriously hate my life. I'm miserable as shit. The one good thing I had, you want to break up with me, but you don't know how to do it and you don't want to hurt me. I can understand that, I'm a nice guy and you hate to be the BITCH THAT BREAKS HIS FUCKING HEART, but what can you do right? He cares about you a lot so you better ditch his ass QUICK.
	I'm so sick of this. Why can't you just care about me back? Are you fucking made a stone? What is wrong with people. I get you have problems from the past, it's probably over. I hope you have a good life with your kids.

It's the end of the day and I'm making my way out of the Science building. As I walk down the stairs

I'm at the bus stop and you show up. You walk right up to me.

""Finally

You introduce yourself to me and declare that you are the Muffin Man. You chase my little sister and her friends

***

I see you again in a club. You wonder where I've been

You offer to buy me a drink. I don't want to look stupid

You chat me up

***

We have our second kiss by the bus stop. It's in front of a lot of the girls from school but I don't care. We joke and kiss and I love every second of it. It's late October and it's freezing

***

We've been seeing each other for a few weeks. I'm smitten. I stay up late most nights hoping to catch you on MSN. I get butterflies whenever you sign in. 

I ask you how your weekend was. You tell me that it was great; you went to the pub with your girlfriend.

Girlfriend.

What? 

***

I'm sad that you were seeing other people besides me

You break up with your girlfriend and I'm having problems with my boyfriend. He's cheated on me

Even so, I won't move. You cry on my shoulder and get snot on my top. 

***

I've broken up with my boyfriend and we're sitting on a stage in a dark corner. We kiss and it feels like something has fallen into place; like I haven't been a whole person for a long time

***

We've been seeing each other again and our mutual friend has been on at you to ask me out properly. 

In early May

""Fuck it

I know you're doing this for the wrong reasons

***

I'm missing you one night

***

I've just arrived at your house. I walk into the kitchen and you're standing at the open window. You turn around and hold me. You tell me that you had a dream where you lost eveyone that you loved

You cheer up and we have lunch. You kiss me. Your mouth is full of chewed Wotsits

***

We're leaving a party

""I think I'm falling in love with you"" you whisper.

A lump catches in my throat and I can barely get the words out.

""Me too.""

***

We're on the bench by the bus stop. It's mid-May. The sky is summer-blue and the few clouds are white and lazy. I lean back against you and you buzz teasingly in my ear

***

It's early June and I've just sat an exam. I've been laughing with friends

I wait at the bus stop to meet you. You show up and ask me if I want to get a drink. We walk to the pub across the road and sit by a window overlooking the bus stop. I pay for the drinks

You sit down and we talk about our exams. And then

""Do you think this is working?""

My honest answer would have been no. You have such a huge personality and I feel overwhelmed by it. I can rarely think of anything to say

""Yes.""

You proceed to break up with me. It's not me, it's a ""break"". You're not comfortable in your own head, you can't deal with the silences. 

Of course, but I can't find my voice. I just concentrate on getting to the bottom of my glass. 

***

I'm on the bus home and I let a few tears escape. We're staying friends and I have to seem OK with that. 

***

I get home and tell my mum I have a cold. I go to bed

***

I'm sitting on my computer in late June and I see a picture of you and the girl you took to your prom. Is she the reason why you ended it? I feel sick. 

***

It's November and I've barely seen you since we broke up. You've been avoiding me. You ask me if I want to get a drink after college. I accept

We drink and drink and drink. We catch up. We leave. I'm seventeen and I'm drunk and I still love you. I lose my cool. I shout at you for calling it a break just so that I'd stop opposing the break up. It was a shitty thing to do. I cry. You cry. We kiss. 

***

A few weeks later you ask me if I want to get back together. I say no. I'm seeing someone. That doesn't work out and for a long time I regret turning you down

***

I believe that love is never the same twice. I could look back on this now, and loved differently, doesn't mean that what I felt wasn't love. Those feelings were real and when I look back I can feel it all. It was ""teenage love"" and it was filled with hormones and paranoia, innocence and hope. The heartbreak taught me to be strong, but it also taught me to be cynical. I have never loved like that since, I have never allowed myself to become so vulnerable so quickly. I learned to build walls and I became a fortress.

 A customer of mine came into the shop today. I hadn't seen him in over a year, are you happy to be single again?"". I paused before providing the obligitory 'aww, hell yeah!' that my male bravado required me to supply. These are reflex responses, the little lies that we use to shield us when revealing the truth would unmask us and expose our vulnerability. Pausing, I realized I hadn't really given that particular question much thought. 'Am I happy to be single again?'. In that brief instant, I experienced what some would call a flashback, others a moment of clarity.
  It was an anonymous fall Sunday, and Kristy and I lie on the sofa front-to-back, spooning on the narrow cushions. She dozes, and i feel the pleasant numbing of my arm as her bodyweight presses down on it. I can feel her warm breath on my skin, smell the fresh-linen scent of her hair, and the faint, steady throb of her pulse as it thrums into my hand on her hip. She stirs briefly, and resettles sleepily. She takes my hand and pulls it to her chest, the merging of two people as one. The harmony of taking each breath in unison, as it's meant to be. In this quiet bliss
  I stand a little unsteadily in front of my customer. He wears a look of slight concern. A wave of emotion washes over me, a certainty that I will never have that perfect moment with Kristy again. The loss is palpable within me, as if something vital has been stolen, wounding my spirit. I look away, formulating an excuse to be anywhere else right now as tears well up in my reddening eyes. As I force a weak smile, the words escape me in a haunted whisper, as if spoken by a ghost. ""happy? no. not really"".

I hope someone learns from my shitty mistakes...and finally find true love


*tl;dr - the 'one' should be someone that you share mutual love and respect with and is truly your best friend - so sayeth this asshole*

I don't know how old you are

As much as I hate the fucking cliche and it's read at every wedding and I've cringed every time I've heard it...and it's even painful for me to admit that..but

""Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing

-- I'd like to add that it's mutual and not one sided.  That whole saying goes for BOTH people

I'm almost 38 years old and I'm a professional with post-graduate degrees..and I'm also in the middle of my second divorce.  Why? because I'm a fucking idiot.  But

My first marriage sucked because I was young and she was younger.  We grew apart

My second marriage sucked because I was so hung-up on the destruction of my first marriage that I thought I was screwed up and that eventually things would get better only to realize

Now.  What have I learned from those two massive fucked up relationships?  Simple.  Find your best friend. Not just a friend.  Find your best friend that is really your best friend that you also want to bang 9 ways to Sunday at any given moment.  

Find the one you can't wait to see.  Don't make that shit up.  ""oh

In sum

* Be happy with yourself and where you are and what you believe.
* Find the person you genuinely want to tell everything to.
* Find the person you want
* Find the person that compliments your personality.  But isn't too different from you.
* Find the person that enjoys being with you as much as you enjoy being with them.
* Find the person who talks you down off that ledge and isn't an asshole about it.  
* Find that person that picks you up when you're down and doesn't make you feel like a pussy for getting down once in a while...because it's a normal part of life!!
*Find that person you'd rather sit on the couch with and play scrabble and watch shitty tv with than do anything else.  That doesn't mean always and that's all you'll do...but when it comes down to rainy boring Saturdays
* Find that person you're not afraid to be vulnerable with who also isn't afraid to be vulnerable with you.
* Find that person you have mutual love and respect for.  

--Marriage and relationships have no room for pride or ego. 

--That's the person you settle down with.

--A friend of mine described it as ""there are 10's in love.  Wait for your 10.  That doesn't mean that you won't find and enjoy a 7 or an 8 or even a 9...it just means, as for marriage, wait for your 10.  

If you *both mutually love and respect each other*

Cheers and good luck to you.  One last thing, get up and go look for it. But leave the stalker shit at home).

A month or two after she got to Allison Steele, she NEVER talks to anyone). I cant remember what i said, but I made her do more than just smile, i made her blush, and laugh! I moved back to my original seat afterwords, giving her the excuse that ""i didn't like her all by herself over there, and i never saw her smile"" and that ""my work here is done!"". WAY WAY later on, and we talked, so i kept my distance. 

About a week ago, and it couldn't have gone better! We smoked the last of my shisha from my hookah, watched How to Train Your Dragon, ate some delicious pizza, and afterwords, laid down, cuddled, and I couldn't stop thinking about her! She was attractive in more than just one way as well! She liked the same music, and a thinker. Also, and was a very open-minded person.

Now, hold hands in the hallway, and she kissed me yesterday :D So far, I'm loving every last bit of what's going on.

you can relate places, 
but when it's over they will be long gone
It will not matter how you feel 
don't trick yourself because here's the deal:
In all actuality it only can last so long. 
few things last forever but
It will run its course and feel right
but when it is over
even if you kind of subconsciously wanted the break up too.
 
So you say
You think love won't return again because of this one screw up
but you'll see differently once you can see through the clouds.
You'll see the sun because

Even if you feel like this was your one true love
another will come or this one will in another time.
It might have been right
You have to have two positives 
because a positive and a negative will cancel out.

So cheer up
even when it doesn't feel like it.
tough days will come and things will happen that you can't control.
you will freak out on the person because you forget they don't have to care anymore

Gabriel was 8 years old when he passed away.  Although he lived a short life

The main illness from which he was afflicted is known as Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome (HLHS).  This is a rare congenital heart defect where the left ventricle of the heart is severely underdeveloped.  Gabe also had what is known as Kabuki Syndrome.  This is believed to be a genetic defect with multiple congenital abnormalities and intellectual disabilities.

Despite all of Gabes issues, and rarely was in a bad mood.  Gabe spent over 600 nights in the hospital, most of which my mother tended his side.

In May of 2011

During that week, we were given a house to stay in, and all meals were provided for.  The pizza delivery guy wouldn't even take a tip!  Not only were we given a place to stay, but the GKTW and MAW groups provided my family with free tickets to go to any and all of the Disney theme parks for our entire stay.  Just so you know, my brother absolutely LOVED Disney.  Mostly the princesses :P  But I can tell you this, he had never smiled as much as he did that week.

That's not all they did for my family.  Normally the age limit for siblings to participate in these trips is limited to 18 years old.  I was in the Navy at the time and I was also 22 years old.  My sister

None of us knew how little time we had left with Gabe.  If it were not for the GKTW village and the MAW foundation

Gabe was a miracle.  And the way he lived his life showed my family what God is capable of doing for us during times of despair and tragedy.  I also learned what the definition of love is.  It is selfless care for another

I just wanted to share this story, but there is solace in the realization that this life is not the end.

TLDR: My brother Gabe passed away on August 21, and we were completely loved by everyone there.  Thank you Give Kids The World, thank you Make-A-Wish, and thank you God for giving us Gabriel Michael Coy.

love is a funny thing because it will take your heart, and take it again, its like a roller coaster ride, but even though its scary, you want to keep riding.

love is magical
it leads you to a place where no one can tell you how you feel,

Love is universal
no matter who you are, love is blind.

you may not be looking for love but when you find someone, you care more about everything, and care less about what people say

love is like a trance,

He turned to me and stared me straight in the eyes. He began to speak. ""Do you believe that we as humans have souls?""

""Well

""That is the first step to understanding. You see, then things will come too easy. The soul needs a counterpoint, a little bit of difference and a little bit of the same. It's very rare to find the perfect counterpoint but there may be a few in your lifetime. All it takes is a little effort. Once the counterpoint is found, the soul is internally conflicted. It cannot decide whether to be accept or dispel this counterpoint. These conflictions cause the heart to pound, the breath to shorten, the want to never let go. Uncontrollable nervousness.""

Single.

Male.

And I've had three serious relationships. 
My longest one was for 3 years and it was my best and most current former relationship. 
I had only slept with 3 people at that time (including her)...

Imagine being with someone you click completely well with

The baby names they call you, the warm cuddling and the enjoyable silences of just knowing they are there with you.

This relationship, but something was wrong with me and this can happen to most of us guys who.. just don't know what they truly want..

And speaking for a man

And literally

That side of life that went unexplored really got me curious and ate me up inside..

It's a shame to think that a great relationship you can have with someone

And at times

Their are times I look back and realize how much of a fool I was to agree to a break up.. but nevertheless...

I went off, I got what I wanted, I traded security and love for freedom and fun. I had gone on many dates, slept with girls and found out people are beautiful in terms of what they have to offer sexually and just who they are in general.

But..

I realized despite many of the narrow minded

How society, the bachelor and how that seems like a welcoming, wanted and free independent lifestyle for yourself..

That I painted up this idea of a cool-cat

That when they say love is overrated..

That..

Many of us

That one girl that fits exactly what we're looking for

That lust is just so much easier to give into

Does anyone else feel this way or find themselves in a similar boat?

1334000247.0,s19i6,The danger of a real life fairytale.,coastalthrowaway,12,1,6,"Hi folks.  I'm not sure I'm even looking for advice

I had this friend when I was a kid.  I'll call her Katie.  Katie and I were best friends, 13.  We snuck our mom's cigarettes and alcohol, we went sledding together, we spent basically every spare moment with each other.  We were neighbors in a small apartment building in rural Maine, so there was always a lot of time with nothing going on but our own entertainment.  There was nothing romantic when we were kids, just that special kind of friendship where you trust the other person in the implicit way only a child can manage.

Katie and I grew up poor.  I mean, so that short period of stability was just somehow magically different.  That time period is the happiest of my life, Reddit.

Unfortunately, so staying in contact wasn't easy.  Shortly after that her mom abandoned she and her sister and subsequently was arrested and imprisoned for several years.  We completely lost track of each other other than memories.

Periodically over the years as the internet grew and as various services became popular we'd look for each other, after all).  We stayed longer than we intended, and made plans to go out again.  Long story short, by mid-November we were officially together.

From that point I felt like I was living a kind of mid-life fantasy - at 30 I had re-met the woman of my dreams and my best friend, and while she does have a precocious little boy he seems to like me pretty well and I'm growing pretty attached to him too.

Here's the problem, and I always feel like it was a terrible mistake after a month or so and find myself wishing I was single again - so I make that the case.  Unfortunately this has cause quite a bit of pain to women who don't deserve it over the years.  Each time I feel like maybe this time it'll be different, and each time I end up leaving.

1318539983.0,lb9n2,My True Story: Falling in Love with the Girl of my Dreams.,EuroTrash_84,15,4,4,"*Any syntax


It all started back in August of this year, her letting me know she remade her profile and was back online; we had only ever chatted here and there online nothing serious because I was too afraid to tell her I liked her a lot, the fantasy in my head was to special to risk getting shot down and extinguished entirely; that and she is so beautiful I knew I never had a chance, not with all the other guys online.


I causally responded with a ""thanks for letting me know your cute butt was back online"" I believe that may have been the catalyst that got everything rolling the way it did. It's at this time I will mention that she is from the USA and I am from Canada, then I went about touring in Warsaw seeing the sites and loving the culture.


My next day in Warsaw I met my cousin who I had never met before, over a bottle of Vodka. We drank until 1 or 2am; after getting properly sauced and getting to know each other he jumped in a cab back home and I had planned to go to bed, but before hitting the hay I checked my iPad really quick to see what my friend back home were getting up too, that's when I opened my Skype to see her online; now I am not sure exactly how the conversation went or how it started but I do remember some key points, at one point I had an argument with myself in my head of course; you ever heard the saying drunk words are sober thoughts? Well I laid it out right there and then I typed simply ""I like you and I have for quite sometime"" there was no response for a minute or two, the tension sobered me up quite a bit as I had come to terms with what I had done, when she responded she said ""really?"" I was devastated


That sentence hit me like a ton of bricks, after signing off I walked over to the open balcony and looked out over the city, the architecture of Old Town Warsaw bathed in the gold of the early morning sun embraced by the cool summer air. I had never been happier.


We continued to talk online, I had already booked a trip to the USA for a conference after I returned from Europe, but I told her that if she wanted I would reschedule my flight to her home town and spend a couple days hanging out in person; she agreed. Lets fast forward a bit to my arrival in Wolfsburg Germany my Polish SIM card would no longer provide me with internet here and I couldn't find a pre-pay data SIM card in Germany so I did the only logical thing, I purchased internet at the hotel I was staying in at a cost of 30 euro a day.


Lets again jump in the time machine and jump forward a couple more days to my arrival back in Canada. I had two weeks of work before my flight to the USA and my anticipation was hitting levels near critical mass; I thought great when I mean her I am going to be a blubbering sweating mess; the closer I got however the more relaxed I felt that was until after landing on US soil and turning my phone on I received a text that said ""I just saw your plane land"" as I walked down the long hallway to the airport terminal people were hurrying past me and I could see them being greeted by loved ones, I don't have the words to describe the rush of emotions that washed over me but she must have felt it too because there were no words needed between us all we had to do was hug and it was at that moment I recall being at peace with myself and with life. I felt like I had known her my whole life, I shed a tear.


I won't go into much detail about how we spent the next 5 days but it was the time of my life, by the time I got to her front door I was full on tears and she was close behind, I had never felt emotion so beautiful and so completely devastating as that moment right there knowing in a couple minutes we would be apart. I managed to pull myself together long enough to say a proper good-bye and get into my rental car, but that only lasted until I was out of her driveway; I cried my eyes out the whole way to the airport, not even too sure how I managed to get there, I cried at the check-in desk, at the security check point, the entire plane ride back to Canada and as I sit here typing this right now I am crying at the beautiful memory I am left with.
Never did I think I would feel this way about another person or have them feel this way about me

Making a long story short a week or two after I got back home we made plans for her to come visit me and I bought her a plane ticket for December 8th. Although I know I have something amazing to look forward to some nights are hard

I remember it felt like having a tornado of butterflies in my stomach, our bond was instantaneously strong, like ive known her my entire life. During this dream we had an incredible time. We were fighting off villains on top of crystal castles, sitting around a camp fire with my best friends. She saved my life a couple of times and vice versa =).

I felt complete and I knew she felt the same way. We hardly exchanged words and when she touched my hand with hers it was like thousands of little needles softly poking my skin.

Don't get me wrong, let alone talk to her, let alone have the same feelings for her...

I'm like most teenager girls, affection and attention; that's exactly what I'm getting.

To premise this story, but as the months went on, it became sexual. I was abused for 3 months by someone that was meant to love and care for me. I was still very, very young and I didn't understand the ways of the world so I thought it was my fault. Anyways, I managed to get away after this 'man' tried to rape and kill me.

During these events, separation anxiety, social anxiety and I break down at the drop of a hat. I didn't have many close friends at this time because I went to an upstanding private school and I was one of the few weird kids who didn't talk much, so I didn't have anyone to talk to about this 'issue' I was having.

Forwarding to a year later, who I met when he came new into the school. He was nice, funny, but distant. When I told him about my incident with my previous boyfriend, he flipped off the rails, completely, and started threatening thin air. At this point, angry or raised their hands. So this scared me and I had a breakdown

During the time that I was dating Sam, because I needed people to talk to at my new school and Jeff was attending that school, so our families organised an impromptu dinner for Jeff and I to socialise in a comfortable environment. 

At school we didn't talk much for the first few weeks. I was still having many anxiety attacks and didn't really want to become 'friends' with anyone at that point; I was dealing with self harm/abuse and an eating disorder.

But over social media, and at school we started hanging out more and more. I was still in a relationship with Sam though, but not for long. After 5 weeks at the new school I was single and wondering if dating was really worth it. I was dealing with separation anxiety and loneliness. I was talking to Jeff about this, and we got into a D'n'M about how much people can hide without you even having a clue. We talked about the issues we both had, what bad things had happened to him - then he asked me if I was hiding anything. So I told him, I had never trusted anyone like I trusted him, I felt comfortable with opening up. The best thing about this moment is he didn't flip out, or make a massive deal of it. He just talked to me

Soon after

19 months and 3 days later, he treats me like a princess and makes me feel like I am the most beautiful person in the world.

Here I am

Someone PM'd me after I commented about my relationship in another thread. I gave them hope and they made me realize that what I have is a love story. Maybe not the best love story

 
&gt;The love of my life broke up with me 6 years ago, needy and very insecure.
&gt;
I never stopped loving him
&gt;
Then last January I sent him a message and he answered me. We've been talking for a year now
&gt;
So now we are back together. After 6 long years. He's my best friend and I still love him just as much (if not more) than I did in the beginning.
&gt;
My heart still skips a beat when I hear his voice

I left out some very personal things

There are no words to explain how I feel inside. I am actually happy. SO happy. 

We may not get to be physically together every day but we still text, I tell him my deepest secrets and he's okay with them. He has told me his and I am okay with them, too. 

I don't judge him for anything. I don't hold any grudges. He broke my heart before, but never ever angry at him, and I never hide it, I let him know how I feel. But for the most part, no I am not jealous. 

We have movie dates. Oh how I love watching movies with him. He doesn't talk my ear off or ask me a million questions. My perfect mate. haha. 

Seriously though

Don't ever try to make yourself seem like an amazing person

I have met other people online before and I couldn't ever be myself, we think it's kind of crazy actually because we haven't been that way with anyone else. And neither of us can explain why we are like that with each other... except the fact that we're meant for each other. ;)

I have rambled on



**TL;DR - Still kind of long, fell in love (although I knew I loved him before I went to visit him), broke up after awhile, didn't talk much for 5 years, wrote him 1 year ago and he wrote back, we have been great friends the past year (without him knowing how much I still love him), met up with him over the Christmas Holidays and had a few really long talks (shortest was 8 hours), we decide to be back together not long after that

*Edit: Forgot to mention that we met over the internet

*Edit 2: I also forgot to mention that we both agreed that even if we aren't together or with other people, and he's the only one I've ever been able to imagine myself marrying. I've never really wanted to get married, until I met him. I would marry the shit out of him.*

It grew so big until one day

It caught the wind and flew away

It met a kite along the breeze

That only wanted to be free

From the strings that hold it down

Suspicious of the solid ground

|

Floating high above the beach

Trembling softly out of reach

With sky above and sea below

A blue balloon in a foreign home

|

The current swept it higher still

Past storms and seagulls

It swelled with pride

Yelled 'you will not forget me'

He was always helped me and without him I'd never made it until now.
Even when i had trouble with my (now ex)boyfriend he helped me out while he actually loved me too. But he wanted me happy so he didn't told. My ex broke up with me and he was there to make me feel better. He didn't used the fact that I became single. Even the times i screamed at him to go away because I desperately wanted to die he stayed. Even if he'd had to stay the whole night. He took me to see so many places
I was there for me for two years
Last summer we threw a key in the sea together and he said 'by the time we break up
He is 7 years older but everyone tells us that they couldn't imagine a better couple.

That's probably why I didn't care about them when I was with you.
But you're at your place right now and I'm at mine.
And although you're taking comfort in reading, I'm just sitting where we used to sit.
In front of this dusty coffee table.

I would come home from work to find you curled up in bed
I remember trying to sneak in and surprise you every time
The winters here were cold
And although I wasn't sleepy
I loved the way your hair tickled my face
So there we were. You

You would sometimes wake up to me kissing your shoulders and back.
And sometimes that’s what it was.
I whispered thanks to God for making you those other times.

My parents never approved of my girlfriends.
They would always worry about what they wanted in a wife for me.
If she didn’t fit the bill they would tell me to break up with her.
They would try to convince me that we were actually just friends having a bit of fun.
And when I was alone they’d tell me to marry a creation of their own misguided love.

I remember the night you drove me to my parents when I was sick.
They weren’t home
When they arrived they asked me how I got there after you left
The next morning they listened to me make a long list of all of the things you liked.
Of sweet drinks
They were surprised to see me so active and focused despite my fever.
I considered the supply of the list items
I asked them to deliver the items to your home.
They agreed to my demands
I think that’s when they realized that I loved you.
They delivered the items and never spoke to me about girlfriends after that.

I still wonder if the nectarines were juicy. They weren’t even in season.

The nights challenge me the most.
Writing and prayer keep me busy
Last night I woke up at 5:30. I tried
I washed my hands and came back to an empty bed.
The blankets you slept under that night were not mine.
Each bottle of water remained capped and standing.
I lied awake and quietly missed you.

Two and a half hours later
I gave a presentation that morning.
I ate lunch, then came home.
I wrote for a while.
Then I prayed for a while less this time.
And now my better judgement is guiding me to sleep.

My love

The lamp on my desk is still broken.

I was biking home today trying to swallow all of the tears I had as a result of our chat earlier. It didn’t help that my coworker was leaving. Along the way I opened my mouth for some air and managed to swallow a piece of tree debris because today was very windy and things were being blown in all directions. I thought about how you would have enjoyed how absurd I looked given my situation.

I got home and picked up where I left off: picturing where we’d be a year from now. It’s funny how I’m always looking back into the past when I think about the future.

I’m glad that I’m reminded of the good things we had, the emptiness will be filled (and with good things, God willing), but you will always occupy a place in my heart. I guess that’s why I’m writing this letter to you right now. I guess it’ll be a list of all the things I don’t want to forget. I also secretly hope that you’ll remember these things too, and miss me every once in a while when you think of them.

Some of these things have been brought up before. You know how fondly I think of them. Like how excited I was to leave work every day so that I could come home to you. You’d be in bed, but sleepily lift up the sheets to welcome me inside anyway..

We’d go shopping sometimes. Now that I think of it, then leave it somewhere else. It must have given the supermarket employees a story or two to find noodles in the dairy aisle every week.

We’d also cook for each other sometimes. I don’t know why I wasn’t a fan of butter before. I know I’ve had it

One of my regrets is that I never took good care of my skin. It’s obviously important

I’m also glad that I had you to call when I had bad dreams. You told me that I could call you at any time and you’d come running. I pictured you as Ponyo, but he really loves her.

And finally (for now)

You just sent me a text message, and that you’ll call me if you do.

Girl moves into our flat and we immediately get along. We drink, holding my hand etc. I still don't act on it. Last Friday she writes on my fb saying 'after work beers at my work?' (she's a waitress) and I think 'fine, it's a cool friendly hangout'.

 I get home and she looks amazing! She is very dressed up and asks me how long it will take to get ready. I shower and put on some nice clothes too and we are off. We arrive at her work and from the instant we walked in it was if she was showing me off to her workmates. Her boss looked me up and down then she whispered in my ear that the bosses like to size up the girls the guys come in with. We try and find a seat and there is a convenient litlle romantic table for two on the balcony. We sit down and she orders us a variety of snacks and heaps of beer (all on her, she reaches for my hand and we have our fingers interlocked, squeezing affectionately every now and then. The girls mention making a move towards the club when I get a txt from the girl I'm out with saying 'let's just go home and watch a movie'. I txt back yes and after saying our goodbyes we walk to find a taxi. She is under my arm and as we walk she stops and swings into me and we kiss. We get in the taxi and continue. We arrive home and we snuggle up in the couch ready to watch something but we realize we are to drunk and go to her room. We end up sleeping in eachothers arms which was amazing. 

Fast forward a few days of happiness and I get a txt saying we need to talk. Fuck. I greet her as I arrive home and we have a fun night chatting etc. Then she says she is going to bed. I mention the talk and she says 'oh yeah'. She tells me she likes me

Here's my story. ",1,9,http://www.reddit.com/r/love/comments/13k70w/have_you_ever_fallen_in_love_online_heres_my_story/,"So, I'll start off by saying that about a year and a half ago I was bored and downloaded a crazy chat app from an App Store. 

It randomly paired you with a person after you have entered certain criteria. 

To make the story shorter

Sadly he and are are on completely different continents. So it makes it difficult to meet (we haven't yet

We have an awesome connection. We like the same things. We have the same goals. But as in any relationship

During one of those kinks we actually stopped talking. Rather he stopped talking to me because of a girl he had met in his country. 

I was in love with him but didn't tell him because I was terrified of love. I still am. But I was more afraid of loving someone so much

He finally told me what was going on and I stupidly told him then

He had found someone else because he thought I wasn't interested. That relationship lasted less than a month and we were committed to being just friends to give his new relationship a chance to grow.  It didn't last very long. Can't say that I was very sad about that though. 

This is where my big mistake came in. After this episode

We continued our amorous relationship after that. Fast forward 6 months and he starts acting weird. Not Answering messages. Even evading me. 

Eventually I had given up on him. I moved on. Tried a relationship with another guy. But that didn't work out. 

Then out of the blue

I had done a lot of growing up during the time we didn't speak. I was more sure of myself. I told him I forgave him and that I did miss my best friend. 

We talked a lot in the next days. He finally told me he hadn't gotten over me and that he missed what we had. I still loved him

Finally one day I decided I had had enough of hiding my feelings for him. Not telling him what I felt for him almost made me lose him once. I wasn't about to let it happen again.

I told him I loved him. He said that he had been giving me space and time to decipher my feelings and that he too loved me more than he could explain in words.

This is technically our third go around at this in one and a half years. I love him more than anything and I have learned to trust him again. He expresses his love to me daily and I do the same. 

We've both grown matured significantly and realized we want this relationship to work out. We don't fight and speak regularly on the phone.

Don't you find owls beautiful ? Spiders lovely ? We do. So... What could I say more... I fell in love. Yes. I wasn't sure but... Now I am. Oh Thor. I feel so shy now...

After the vacations (I am now, I would like to ask her to be my girlfriend. I was wondering about how I could do it. Take her hand when we are alone and ask ?
So... What do you think about all of this ? Do you need further explications ? Sorry

So it was about three years ago, but she responded with jade. And i just fell in love with the name. So joking around i said tell her I said hi and she did so she said hi back and told me to text her sometime. So I got her number from matsa and finished the day of, I went home and texted her for the first time. We got along just fabulously she was kind, smart, beautiful and just all around a lovely person. So the summer went by and we kept talking and talking and we found that we had a lot in common, well after that it was the same throughout the school year. So summer came again and by then we were the best of friends we'd always be texting and talking but we never met. So I believe it was about midsummer when I was playing MW2 I started to become a gamer, anyways as usual we were talking and she said i'm in love. me by then was completely madly in love with her. So me thinking it was someone else but not wanting to tell her said ""oh?"" ""with who?"" and she responded ""with you"". I felt such excitement such joy so much love i started to cry. But it was only then that I remembered we were moving away to mexico. So I asked my mom if she would take me to see her before we did and she said this to me when we arrived to mexico, a week went by and it was 2 days before we left and my mom said ""i'm going up north if you'd like I can drop you of at jade's house"" of course I said yes. So when i arrived her mom and brother were gone

I want to share the weird ride I've been on for the past few weeks

    




I'm 27 (male), and yet... I think she might be the one!  
 

    

    

I'll start my story with a little history -  

I've always been a little shy and sometimes socially awkward. I've always had good friends, different personal focus), and largely thanks to my first serious relationship, at the age of 26 (I've had GFs before, but nothing that lasted more than 2-3 months). 

This last relationship lasted about a year, about to move to a bigger one, and my Ex started using ultimatums to get me to marry her. This, along with some long-held doubts I already had, led me to the decision to leave and look for ""real love"". I wanted to find a relationship where I would just know ""this is it, she's the one"", rather than making a rational decision to ""do the right thing and settle down""...  

    



One more thing to note about me is that I pretty much wrote the book on self-control and rational reasoning. I tend to use my rational decision making skill for 99% of the choices I have to make, and we've been making some progress.  



    

Now back to my story - 

It's been a little over 3 months since that relationship ended, but it's not something I'd like to make into a habit. 

    

Enter my new love - 
Basically, followed by a face-to-face date. 
I could already tell she was cool and open minded from our online interactions

When we had our first date, and simply better than I expected on every parameter...  To be honest, I was just flattered she entertained the idea of dating me...  

One thing that kind of hurt my outlook on our chances was that there was absolutely no physical contact, expecting to get denied a second date, but try I did - AND SHE SAID YES!  
Our second date was unbelievably awesome, and made an effort to be romantic. That date ended with a kiss, and I was as happy as I could be.  
From that point on, but when I'm on my own it's as if I'm a 15yo schoolgirl with a crush. I can't stop daydreaming, and my emotions pretty much run me. I went from showing and having next to no emotions, to having full-on, deep feelings, and even the occasional tears of joy when I'm on my own...  

     

I know how crazy this sounds


      

On the rational side of things

We're attracted to each other, we're both at an age where that is a valid option in a few years, and I think we both played the field enough to be ready to commit when the time comes. 



      

on the emotional side, at least at this point...



      

Reddit - what are your thoughts?  



    
    

TL;DR - After a lot of hardship, even though we have only been seeing each other for a few weeks.

I believe that she likes me too, we automatically stop touching each other, and pretend it never happened. She did though, take my hands quite a few times at the party, where we sat at a table talking with each other, but also other people. However, still so that nobody could see it. This was all a few days ago, she agreed. However, she has lost interest? But on the other hand - the last time it ended well

So yes, sit down, tell her that I really enjoyed the last couple of months where we have been together a lot, as well as feeling happy when I'm around her. So in conclusion, that I like her. And hope to get the same thing back, and move from there. (Should I kiss her, if she says the same thing? I'm pretty sure she hasn't been REALLY kissed before. She's not someone who just takes any guy.) If it's relevant

Any advice on this? Should I tell her in another way? And could she have lost interest already

A few years ago I met this girl, 3hr trip). Then one time that I went to visit her she told me she didn't want to be with me. Not only that but that I annoyed her, she would rather spend time with her friends, horrible at sex and basically everything you could imagine. I was completely heart broken. I thought Sasha and I were going to be together for a long time. I cried my eyes out weeks after that. My self-esteem went completely down and just kept thinking that no one will ever love me. Time passed and thankfully my friends were there to pick me up. They took me out to kickboxing, soccer and to the clubs just to keep my mind off her. They would tell me all the bad things they saw on her and after a while I realized that they were right I just didn't see it because love blinded me. I didn't realize I was being verbally abuse by her until we broke up. 

After a while I was able to start dating again and thats when I met her, since sometimes sex does complicate things. One night when I was holding her in my arms I started to think how horrible I felt when I was with my ex since she would always put me down and how happy I was feeling holding Sam and simply being with her. Sam and I bake together and joke around and she always makes me really happy. It was a huge difference and honestly while I was holding Sam one night a tear came out. A tear of pure joy. Sam didn't notice I simply kissed her forehead and she hold me tighter. Now all I want to do is thank my ex for breaking up with me, if she wouldn't have i would have met Sam. &lt;3

PS When Sam and I started to have sex we had sex every night and every morning (2 to 3 times) for the next 3 days. She said my name and ""oh my god"" every time. What my ex told me only made me try harder and now Sam is benefiting from that.

There are things you don’t say aloud. I mean, inside, it’s like a sea of emotions. You’re confused but happy at the same time. You don’t know what you think at some points but then at others, everything seems natural. 
The point is, a sign, a gift, and it just says anything and everything you’ve ever wanted t say to that person. Sometimes, you don’t have the guts to do anything. It may be because you’ve been hurt in the past or you’re just afraid. 
But I urge you, it will overwhelm you. You’ll be forever wondering. 
For example, mucked around, but we were just friends. I began to like him but was afraid. Then he moved. Looking back at that, the crying and the anger and the hoping for something to happen, well, it was useless. I should’ve done something; he was one of the guys I got along with the most, had the most in common with. I let him go.

So, year 8.
I started out without many friends, attractive, popular guy"" that each class would have, and we had science.
Walks in a girl, and she seems to find our reckless endangerment humorous.....and I kick into showoff mode.
I later on learn through others this girls name is Kaitlen (cute name?) and she had moved here from another high school. Did I want to be her friend? I didn't know. All I did know was that she was really pretty,relaxing,calming, and hypnotic voice.
Luckily I am friends with two girls who already knew her, ever so slightly I feel that maybe this girl is special, But I'm a year eight. I am fairly stupid at this time. yet none the less we talk. and my feelings develop as well. around 9 weeks into knowing her, after lying to her, saying I liked someone else in our class. it just comes out ""I like you alot"" and the time after is kind of a haze.
Stuff like.....I like you...but my dad says no came about.....and I was spun into sadness. spiralling out of control. I felt incomplete if I wasn't talking to her. Yet I found myself growing apart from her. and only half a year later, that she did it for my own good, because she did not want to hurt me. This killed me a little inside. I found it hard to deal with. and so, in approximately November, I was crushed. Scrolling through Facebook, there is was, Kaitlen, with who you ask? Scott
I began my regime. I am happy for you I said, that he may grow jealous. So I stopped. I grew sad every moment I saw them together. But what could I do.
February,for a mere month, before I realise it isn't real. that I am protecting myself, it ends, and again I am all alone. But then, so is she. Her feelings for Scott have died, and my hope rekindles in a sense. over the following year our friendship grows deeply. While we don't see each other out of school. We text and communicate in any way possible. All I can ask myself is... why can it not be? why can't we be the nuclears. A perfect match? far from it I fear. The closer we grow the more I grow.....into a fool, ever so blatantly. An apology rolls off her tongue
Out of nowhere. we find ourselves no talking. and then after many a month. school ends
School begins,laugh. We grow yet again closer, and I repress feelings that I fear may come up yet again(because they have ruined it before) and we become best friends. And then. It is my birthday party, I am turning 16. for me, a time of loud music, drinking and friends. She is coming, of course. and I dress up, and her in a rather dapper red dress. Ever so elegant. Most definitely the best and only girl exciting me that night. I attempt to slow my drinking in order to share the time with her, wanting to give her a quick peck, it ended. My ex girlfriend was there
A girl, and so did she. we then went ahead and arranged it. and on our walk to this place. my friends see's the way Kaitlen and I text. 2500 messages over the last month. She says we are cute together. and that we should get back together! i correct her and tell her, we were never together. but my heart sinks.....why did i have to say that, what if it were all different. I realise the shitty truth. It has always been there. suppressed and repressed by other thoughts, and emotions. FUCK! two days later, i am baking brownies and texting her. She loves brownies? how would she like some? she says yes. so i make my way to her home, a short journey. and give her some. Yet another chance to see her, and enjoys them. I then return home, and say "" hey kaitlen
This next part is for her alone.
Dear Kaitlen. Life over the last three years has been the greatest and worst time of my life with you. The sad times.........they are sometimes about you, and sad for what i do not"" yeah....all about you. I know we are best friends, like a brother and sister. but im sorry, we can and always will be friends, the best of them i hope. but i will always have feelings for you, even if you never will, its an undying hope that i grasp onto tightly, is the only time worth spending. and i apologise for nothing in advance. this is my mind
You are beautiful, my soul, and my breathe. I long for the day when you may say the same. but fear i may die before it comes, and Kaitlen, thankyou for taking the time to read this.

I won't mention what religion I am

Here is my dilemma. I think I have fallen in love with someone not within my religion. In the past I have mostly distanced myself from people I might find attractive outside of my religion in order to avoid this kind of issue. I don't know why I didn't this time. Either way I have no idea what to do. I feel like it'll be very painful to stay away from this guy now that I have fallen for him. He has been nothing but sweet and wonderful to me. We've discussed our futures together (as friends of course- although he has given signs that show his interest) and our humour clicks very well. He is honestly just so incredibly wonderful. Sorry I will stop ranting about him. 

I know my parents will be incredibly disappointed and try to make me stay away from this guy if anything occurs. In the one time I slipped up in the past (fell for a non-believer - who also fell for me) which was in high-school

I don't want this to happen again. 

I know all my religious friends will also disapprove of me and try to (more gently) turn my mind. Even if they are not extreme like my parents they will definitely have an issue with me. 

I don't know what to do. I'm so confused right now. Should I try and distance myself from this guy? Is there something I can say to my parents?

My first time in love. I tried to prevent myself from falling too fast, I knew it was a certainty. So when I went home to the family, I began planning what to say when I got back. Unfortunately, the time apart wasn't enough for me to organize my words, so I decided to write him a love letter. The cheesiest love letter ever. I returned to him on December 30th. He greeted me at the airport, kissed me, held me, but held onto the card a little longer. I was already losing my nerve. I was afraid that he wouldn't feel the same

New Year’s Eve. December 31st

We slept in late so that we would be able to stay awake the whole night our friend's party. I told him that I had to go home to my own apartment so that I could shower and get ready. I put the note on his bed and left

When I returned, held me, and told me that the letter was beautiful, but he didn't love me back. 

I didn’t have enough time to recover from the shock of it, but we were only together 5 months. There was no way he could be in love. Liked me. Somehow I hated the word. Love and hate are feelings that anyone can understand. What does ""like"" mean? I like my girlfriend. I like pizza. I like Bloody Marys. 

He told me he was not freaked out by my confession, that I had misinterpreted his actions and words and thought that if he wasn't in love, he was at least crazy about me, or in some state of infatuation. He tried to explain to me that I shouldn’t regret telling him. He said he cared for me deeply, he wanted to spend time with me, he thought of me constantly, he wanted to please me. I shouldn’t be ashamed for confessing my feelings. Those words gave me an amazing sense of relief.

And while I breathed, I had never felt more loved than I did with him. After years of looking for love, giving love and getting nothing back, I knew I didn't need him to put a name to what he felt. I just needed him to know my heart before it exploded, and now my heart is at rest. Everything I need is already there, only the words remain, and they can come at their own pace.

On New Year’s Eve one year ago, and to be loved. On the 31st of December 2010, I was halfway there, but getting to the second part of that wish is no longer my goal for next year. My new wish is to love him even more, and love this life we can share together, no matter what we call it.

Here's a picture of us on January 1st

Thanks for reading. I know it was really cheesy but I am in that kind of mood and felt the need to share with the internets.

Sometimes we seem to fall into the friend phase and I'll just suddenly realise that anything romantic with them would be weird

Anyhow

I could just jump in like I always do and let everything run its course

I mostly want to know at what point does the girl become a friend or a girlfriend and what determines this? Do I have to *make a move* to let her know I like her in that way? because I'm not good at moves.

When you've been single for as long as I have

*Edit: I went out with the girl

*She mentioned a couple of things that we could potentially do together that would exclude our mutual friend

*Is she telling me that we will only see each other in group situations? Should I attempt to pursue the activities that would cause us to be alone together

When I was six my parents got divorced (I'm nineteen now). I'm sure a great amount of us have a similar story. After that my mother married a man who she currently does not love and does not remember why she ever married

I grew up generally as an outcast in school. I did damn near no dating the entire time, the faces we saw on MTV, the saturization of advertising, the sexual nature of most popular films, and basically every popular media source was telling me that the only thing I should want in the whole world was either love or sex, but most importantly sex (I know this is a bit of a generalization, but for the most part it's accurate in my opinion).

I saw through the sexual pressure and saw that, and after some great trial and thought, I learned to do so, and now love myself immensely (which is something I could definitely not have said two years ago). Then came what I was looking for...

I finally got into a relationship with this girl. Looking back, I fell deeply into my first love. Unfortunately, she didn't. Best way to put it is that every time I said ""I love you"", she said it back and didn't really mean it, but my mind blocked out the obviously false way she acted because I wanted love so bad. Don't get me wrong, I know she loved me, but she was never in love with me

Just for you ladies out there, and you don't love him back, just say you're just not to that point yet, but you'd like to move toward it. Rip it off like a band-aid, because ripping stitches out later fucking sucks.

Anyways, and it's absolutely none of my business, but after I saw that I cracked, hid under a generator by my school's music building and cried for two hours. Getting attached can really suck sometimes.

Now here I am, boys and girls, and their always saying ""should I hook up with her?"" ""You think I could hook up with him?"" ""Did you hear so and so and whats her face hooked up?"". Unfortunately, all I can think of is...IS THAT ALL THIS FUCKING IS TO YOU???? Hooking up? Why don't you ask ""Could I get into a relationship with him?"" Why don't you ask ""Could I cuddle with her tonight?"" Why don't these fucking children put any meaning to their relations? Is it because fifty percent of our parents said ""Fuck this, I'm out"" without even thinking for a moment how it will effect us? Is it because all of our media tells us to get it in all the time and not think about love, cause bitches is just hoes and tricks? Is anyone looking for love? Is our entire generation just fated to think that sex is the main course, and love is a side effect? Is Lil Wayne really the new Barry White to these kids?

Is love dead? Give me your opinion.

Back to the dream, I see myself holding your hand laughing and crying with you, running through city streets without a care because you know I'm there to protect you and you say you don't need me too. But the taxi fares of the hustle and bustle of the dream street seems to be based on the fact that no one truly cares

1342338555.0,wl471,I think I'm falling for my friend... again. But this time it feels more serious.,FuckImOnReddit,8,1,6,"**Context:** So last year, so I kept it to myself. But after watching a movie that really got to me

**A Few Months Go By:** Eventually, one of my oldest friends from high school decided to end our friendship solely because of a misunderstanding. This made me so upset. I was angry, I was sad, I was so overwhelmed with emotion. And my friend, the one who I had crushed on months before, knew *exactly* what to say to make me feel better. He didn't directly console me by saying things like ""Well, at least..."" or something like ""She was a bitch, he spent the whole day with me as we worked on our homework. And it was just nice. When I thought about it

**In More Recent Months (May through July):** I started dating a slightly older guy a little over a month ago. He's great. We have similar tastes in humor, and is generally a good guy. As nice as it is to spend time with him and stuff, I'm still not entirely comfortable with him. I have massive trust issues, so it takes a while for me to open up to people unless I really feel like they're trustworthy. I noticed upon getting to know this older guy, though, that there are some odd similarities between him and the friend that I had crushed on during fall 2011. I jokingly wondered aloud to a few people (including this same friend) if there is a pattern going on with the kinds of guys I liked.

**Here's The Problem:** Recently, he listened and gave me advice (even if he was a bit drunk and had to make a conscious effort to type with proper spelling and grammar). I think every so often what it would be like if me and him got together anytime soon, and I don't know. I just feel like I'd be happy because we're such good friends. 

Unfortunately

1. He doesn't like the idea of dating a friend because it might put the friendship at stake if the romantic relationship is finished. 

2. As much as I like the guy as a friend

3. I'm going to be moving away for school. About three states away.

So I like this girl, and I have even attempted (successfully i don't know) to flirt with her. And from what I can gather, she hasn't rejected any of it. She also gets close to me every chance she gets and I can't for the life of me get her out of my head. She's the cutest thing I have ever seen, is very athletic and likes sports (like me), smart, very funny, and her and I have a surprising number of things in common. She acts way older than her age and looks it to. If I were to make a list of what I looked for in a girl

But now to the problem(s) which pains me to type. 1. She's a couple years younger than me (ill give you that I am a junior in high school). 2. Is moving away (when I think she is) near the beginning of school next year. And finally 3. She's my sister's friend (biggest one).

I wish I could tell her that I have feelings for her but I just can't bring myself to do it. My own sensibility is getting in the way. I obviously have realized all these issues and have thought about them for while and concluded that I can't

1331586693.0,qtgyv,I honestly can't be falling in love...,NotSoLuckyCharms,12,5,11,"So

I'm in my early 20's, and for a number of years, up to very recently, I went through a pretty bad depression. I didn't actually know I was depressed at the time, but I refused to talk to people or leave the house, I just became incredibly introverted, and that sort of killed the relationship with my ex. For some reason though, I just felt like a weight was lifted off my chest, so I suddenly embarked on a journey to make myself happy

First day out of my relationship, but due to constant bugging, I just did it to keep him happy, and put a barebones profile up, with no intention of ever using it. About a week after creating a profile, out of curiosity I logged on and had a few messages, a few visits, was this girl. Instantly I thought she was beautiful

We started to Skype from pretty much day one, we decided to become exclusive until we meet, but then later decided that was pretty much ""going out"" so we decided to make it official, which is something I'd never normally consider, but this for this girl, I was willing to make the leap. I have pretty big issues with commitment since my breakup, but the thought of being with the girl just overpowers those fears.

Since the day I've met her, in all honesty, I've never been happier. I think I'm falling in love with this girl, which honestly scares me, because we haven't even met, or kissed or touched. I feel like I'm clinically insane for feeling this way, so I guess I'm just writing this to get some input from you guys.

Thanks.

P.S I'm 22, and the reasoning we haven't met is because she has school commitments until Easter, and she's ~100 miles away. I'll be going up there for 4 days at the end of the month, which will be our first meeting.

Junior year of highschool, I know I was young and that sounds silly, I know that's what you're thinking right now but just hear me out. For the next few weeks, we started talking, and became VERY good and close friends. I then asked her out, and she said she needs time to think. The next week she starts dating a big burly rugby player. This guy... this guy is insane. Not figuratively, but literally. Over the course of the summer, decides to join the army, like a brother to her. After she breaks up with him, I continued to be her big brother

The next two years are amazing. Truly and honestly amazing. We get to know each other SO well, and we remained best friends and lovers. I don't doubt a single word she tells me, I even give her a ring and she accepts it while crying with joy. I love her with every fiber of my being, and I honestly believe she loves me too. I even go through go through bouts of depression and she's always there, always at my side, always supportive, always loving. She was my rock. My relationship with my family was not even close to good, everything was amazing. 

Then she went to college. I barely hear from her during the first weekend. She left on a Thursday and Sunday night was the first time we talked. I had to call her multiple times because I was scared, and we talk. We decide to try harder at this, to talk more, for me to visit more (she's only 40 minutes away), to just… be better. The next morning while I'm at work, after talking (texting) about classes and things, I say ""I love you"". She responds with my name, she doesn't love me anymore. I can't let go, she went and had sex with a guy she met 2 days before. Since I love her enormously, we start fresh. The next weekend

Two days ago, because we had been doing so well. She says, again, things are not the same anymore. She doesn't miss me, she doesn't love me, she doesn't want to put an effort. Among others, I tell her ""we're so comfortable with each other

Everything I was, we had an amazing present, and we made SO many plans for the future. We named our kids, we told each other stories of our future life together. I was so good to her. I'm not being arrogant or anything, but everyone told her how lucky she is to have me. I'm romantic, loving, loyal, just because I care about her. 

By now, what am I to do? Everything reminds me of her. I spend a lot of time on the computer (I love eSports and I'm a comp sci major) and everything around me is connected to her. I can't escape her. Any advice? Do I talk to her and tell her to come back, tell her she made a mistake? Do I go over to her and throw money and her face, saying ""I've paid my whore""?

Service: No problem. Love will automatically erase Pasthurt.exe from your current operating system. It may remain in your permanent memory, you have to completely turn off Grudge.exe and Resentment.com. Those programs prevent Love from being properly installed. 
Can you turn those off? 

Customer: I don't know how to turn them off. Can you tell me how? 

Service: My pleasure. Go to your Start menu and invoke Forgiveness.exe. Do this as many times as necessary until Grudge.exe and Resentment.com have been completely erased. 

Customer: Okay

Service: Yes it is. You should receive a message that says it will reinstall for the life of your Heart. Do you see that message? 

Customer: Yes I do. Is it completely installed? 

Service: Yes

Customer: Oops! I have an error message already. What should I do?

Customer: Yes

Service: Excellent

Customer: Thank you. 

Service: You're welcome. Click on the following files and then copy them to the ""Myheart"" directory: Forgiveself.doc, you need to delete ""Selfcriticize.exe"" from all directories, and then empty your recycle bin afterwards to make sure it is completely gone and never comes back. 

Customer: Got it! Wow! My Heart is filling up with really neat files. Smile.mpg is playing on my monitor right now

Service: Then Love is installed and running. You should be able to handle it from here. One more thing before I go.. 

Customer: Yes? 

Service: Love is freeware. Be sure to give it and its various modules to everybody you are meeting. They will in turn share it with other people

Let me do a little background so your up to speed..
I was the kid in highschool, i was in the group below the ""Popular"" group after year 8 after leaving them because i couldn't tolerate the fake bullshit and the heavy demand for everyone to be so cool.. 
I never cared for highschool
Soon after i broke up with my girlfriend at the time because she was moving 3 hours away and it just wasnt going to work.
My dad was an alcoholic, after i broke up with that girl, i went downhill, i got into drinking heavily and roaming the streets just being a pure douchebag.. Dad and i fought alot, he was always lecturing me that i wasn't the son he wanted or ever expected, and finally we got into a physical fight due to me not backing down and telling him to fuck off instead, 
The second after that finished
I Spend the next 3 weeks moving from friends house to friends house, living off restaurant throw outs and garbage.
I met a guy who had a spare room, 
Centrelink, and find a job. 
The problem with where i live, 
One day, 1 guy and 2 girls whom i'd never met before, i immediately noticed one of the girls, and after a few weeks, i knew i'd be dating her.
Surely enough i finally introduced myself and started seeing her heaps
My lack of job, like REAL love.
We never fought, and helped with buying food and keeping me alive.
I never paid rent because every cent i had went into keeping myself fed and clean
I was fine with this
We fought probably a total of 2 times in our relationship, and seen her father as the dad i had always wanted. He worked as a plasterer on work sites, and took me along occasionally to help me with some cash, everything was amazing.

Around july 20th last year, this was the first time i was going to see my family and more importantly my dad, who i'd last seen holding me down with his hand around my throat and beating the life out of me.
I flew down to melbourne from the goldcoast, i honestly wanted him dead. 
around a month or two after the funeral, i hold no grudge to them for that.
It was awkward for a month but got better slowly, and was on heavy medication for depression and rage. 
Around christmas last year, and a hell of a lot.
My girlfriend never liked how much time i spent with him, but i was getting too comfortable with the relationship, and wasnt trying anymore.
Christmas eve after a big fight with her, his sister was talking to me alot, and kissed me. 
I didnt stop her..
I rang my girlfriend half an hour later after collecting my head and sobering up quite quickly
And that was the end of us.
I didnt overly care to be honest, to when she told me she didnt want to do it anymore, and that hurt.
knowing i had given up a nearly 2 year relationship for this girl who dropped me at the flick of a hat took its toll on me, i was losing weight quick (im usually around 80 kilos, i was down to 68)
4 months later, and its been a complete role reversal, i cant stop talking to her, i cant stop wanting  her and we're now on the verge of talking to her parents and telling them we want to be together.
She's fallen inlove with me again and i consider myself the luckiest guy in the world
I'm incredibly over protective of her now
I'm trying to move past it and block them out of my head, and it worries the shit out of me.
She's forgiven me for kissing my mates sister and knows i could never do that to her in all of our lives again.
I really am in love with her reddit, and her skin. And i want to grow old with her. 
She is everything i've got

After several delays

I am also very high. On marijuana. 

About 6 hours ago, went inside, watched part of “The Hurt Locker”, ate junk food out a vending machine, smoked another blunt, I departed. 

On the long ass ride back, who in my opinion got a bad hand in life (teen pregnancy, abusive ex-boyfriends, etc.). 

Anyway, 3 of them kind of tense and long-distance and then she broke my heart and kicked my ass out of her life.

It broke my heart. I had lost my job. I had lost my girl. I was fucked. 

I stared smoking pot. I got better. 

She came back. There was an…incident. 3 weeks later

We drifted apart. She owes me money

I think things over. I miss her. I started calling her and talking to her. 

One night

I totally lost it. I cried. And cried. And barely made out fragmented

She wouldn’t listen. She wouldn’t REASON. She wouldn’t admit to having a relationship with the other guy. 

She told me. “We’ll talk tomorrow.” She hanged up. 

Things we’re very

She said that she needed space. 

I got angry. I got sad. I had chest pains. My heart was shattering. Again. 

What had I done to deserve such heinous treatment? I DESERVED an explanation. A RATIONAL one. 

I spoke man to man to my father for the first time in my life. I was SHOCKED to hear what he had to say. 

I hated all women. Equally. DEVIL WOMAN. 

I accepted the fact that I was probably never gonna see my X again. 

And my heart shattered.

But I was OK. 

The language behind the emails and text messages were violent. And painful. 

And blameful. 

I bowed my head and felt guilty. 

And I was almost sure that I had lost her. 

And it hurt. But

UNTIL TONIGHT. 

On the way back from the hospital (you remember the hospital

I couldn’t figure out why it hurt so much. Why her?

I looked up at the sky and asked (begged) God for an answer. I believe in God (non-practicing Evangelist

And He gave it to me.

I’m in love. 

But

We went out once and I place my hand on her
I was electrocuted. I felt a shock run from the pit of my stomach to the tip of my spinal cord. I nearly crashed into a telephone pole. 

She was none the wiser. 

I felt it again tonight. Nearly crashed into a telephone pole again. 

I started to cry. I started to laugh

First time I’ve every felt this. 

How the fuck to I tell her?

I’LL FIGURE IT OUT!

We have a lot going for us

We live in the same country
We both get a lot of attention from the opposite gender

And... that's about it, he claims he loves me and wants to stay together but on the other he respects his family's opinion that he's too young to be this serious about a relationship. He's also been going to a couple of parties lately, and while I don't suspect him of cheating, I do think his coming in contact with other women there has something to do with it.

Part of me says ""If he can't be confident in the relationship and you can, are you stupid?""

I want him to be happy, be happy, and leave me out of your life."" --- I never date the same person twice and I've made exceptions to that rule that ended terribly, I won't do that again. Meaning, if we split, we split forever, no two ways about it. I won't wait for anyone

I firmly believe it's possible for him to come through this and be okay with our relationship again but he's chock full of... cognitive dissonance. It's extremely disappointing. He wants to stay but worries he's missing out on physical interaction. I won't stand around knowing he's unhappy and feels even more stressed out with our relationship like it is. I'm trying to figure out how to close the distance

What do I do? Should I just let him go? Or do you think we can hang in there?

My problem right now is this: she still wants us to be best friends, and I don't know if it's possible for me to continue to be friends with her. Even thinking about her, let alone talking to or seeing her, is painful for me. All I can think about is loving her. I still want to be her best friend more than anything, she's such a great person, but I don't know if I have it in me.
So basically, but I also can't stand the thought of hurting myself more every day by suppressing my feelings. I started to think that maybe it's selfish of me to end our friendship...I just don't know.

There is a girl I have liked for about a year now. the only problem is that when i fell in love with her she was dating this other guy (someone who i have always hated
Around 6 months ago they broke up and i knew this was my chance to be with her. The only problem was that she was not emotionally stable after the breakup, her ex found out i liked her. I guess he just noticed i treated her differently from any other girls. 
At a friends party he confronted me about it and we just had a loud argument and in the argument i the guy told me he still liked her and it was obvious he regretted breaking up with her. That night

The next day I tried to call the girl

about two months passed without seeing much of each other. Every once in a while we would get together for tea and talk for a bit

After talking for a bit we decided to go up to her roof and admire the moon. We kept talking for some time and around midnight I told her we should go down to the beach where there is less light polution and we could see the moon and stars better. 

We were so into our conversation that we lost track of time and missed the last bus to her place. At this point I told her she should come sleep over to my place (my bus was still running) so she would not have to walk in the cold back to her place. I made this offer as a friend and nothing else. I had no intention of making a move on her because the last thing I wanted was a one night stand that would ruing our friendship. 

Once at my place we had a quick snack and she immediately afterwards went to my bed. At this point i had already started seeing some signs that her intentions were different from mine

I was extremely confused so I had to stop this and tell her we needed to talk. I told her I needed to know her intentions

I did not get to sleep much because I kept thinking about the situation. I realized that the next month or two are the last time we will see each other for at least a year because I will be going on exchange next term and she will be going on her exchange the term after. This made me realize that it didnt matter if it was something casual

Before I finish the last part of the story i have to admit that was one of the best nights of my life. sipping tea with her, but because it was with her. Everything we said and did felt so real and genuine. The next morning my reason was blurred with the experience of the night before. It gave me too much hope for the days and weeks to come. 

I feel that is why after 1 day, that she had too much work in school. at first i understood that because I was extremely busy myself and i knew from the beggining she would not be as willing as I was to sacrifice school work to be together. But after so many days of not seeing her, after so many days of her not making the effort to see me I realized that night did not mean the same to her as it did to me. After so many days I realized she just needed someone to make her feel good about heself and she knew I would not turn her down. The morning that we agreed to make our friendship something more, I did not realize the true meaning of ""I cant make any promises"". I had to learn what it means the hard way. 

It has been over two weeks now and I have calmed down. I am no longer pissed and depressed. I stopped calling and texting her because i refure to beg. Although my feelings for her are still there i have decided to move on. I dont think i will get a word from her any time soon.

Skip past a lot of events, Mother's Day, the day where this love of mine disowned her mom, I told her I simply couldn't be friends anymore and I needed to kill this friendship. It was an emotional conversation most of the emotion coming from me but I did the deed. And I felt so good afterward.

Four years ago right around the time I graduated high school, but at the time judging from her pictures she just wasn't my type.

Then school started.  We went to class together, it became increasingly difficult for me.  I was hurting all the time.  At the end of that semester I decided I would stop talking to her.  For the most part that rang true.  We only saw each other a couple times the following semester, because she asked and I couldn't say no.  By sophomore year we had stopped talking entirely and I was, as far as I knew, over her.  

Flash forward to our senior year.  This past February to be exact.  I had long since wanted to give being friends with her another shot

I tried seeing her several times over the course of this summer to ask her out.  Our schedules never quite lined up though.  We finally managed to grab dinner Thursday.  I was gonna ask her out afterwards.  But not long into dinner I found out they had gotten back together.  I was devastated.  The last couple days have been absolutely unbearable.

Sorry if my salutation is wrong, pardon me for my grammatically erroneous sentences, as English is only my secondary language (ESL, as we call it in Canada). I wouldn't say I'm ugly, I would say I look average (at least what I tell myself to help me be level-headed and not get cocky about my looks), I wouldn't say I'm a geek also, but I do love technology and computers, I'm also into sports (huge Basketball fan) and used to play Basketball for my university and high school. I would say I like being adventurous and spontaneous (I'm Sagittarius), why not try the reddit /love community. The reason I only have one friend to talk to about love problems is mainly because of privacy issues and maturity (most of my friends or even people my age don't look for serious relationships yet




I've been with my girlfriend for more than a year already. She is 20 yrs old, about 2 - 4 times a month direct correlation with our stress levels. Usually it's her stress that causes fights, as she is just learning how to control her stress and not take it out on me. We both agree that I have been very patient and understanding with her (she even told me my patience with her isn't worth it and I deserve better, but I just reassure her that she is worth it). However, I am a human too and I have feelings too. I do get fed up with the unjust treatment I receive from her and that's when we fight. We already discussed this as a couple about three times, that she has to try to do a better job in managing her stress and not letting her stress affect how she treats people that have nothing to do with her problems. The most recent being two weeks ago, and prior to that 3 - 5 months ago.


The main issue with my relationship is: our personal needs. We're both Catholics (don't worry, and they are active members in it. As for me, I'm just a regular Catholic, I admit I'm not a devout one and I was even starting to doubt the Catholic church (with all its rules and laws that raises questions). I had to tell her that, and she didn't take the news easily. We almost broke up because of it, the only thing that stopped her was me telling her I'm not leaving the church but just taking some time away from it. 


Also, in other words; no sex until we get married. Not all follow it, as it is a very hard thing to do, I for one wasn't able to follow this. On the other hand, my girlfriend is very firm about this rule. Nothing is to change her mind about it, and I do not intend to force her into having sex with me. That is something I would never do to any woman and of course man. I made a mistake of mentioning this to one of my friends, and it just spread like a wildfire. I was mocked by my friends, and even said things like having sex with my girlfriend, pertaining to the no sex rule). Again, and we almost didn't end up in a relationship together. I appreciate the fact that she was able to accept me


**Warning, but the most we do, in terms of physical contact, is ""dry humping"" and touching each other (my apologies if this is too graphic, I tried my best to word it in a less descriptive fashion). That's the most she would permit me to do. But today, I noticed she wasn't acting normal again and asked her what is bothering her. She told me she doesn't feel comfortable with what we're doing. She doesn't feel comfortable allowing me in her place without her mom's permission (their house rule, although I do know her mom well and even told me she likes me for her). She also doesn't feel comfortable coming to my place when no one else is home because, her  mom doesn't allow her to do so. I understand why her mom would put such rules


I didn't take this easily. I've given up so much in our realtionship to be with her and now she's asking me to give up even more, maybe), and I learned how to be content with what she could offer me (dry humping), and now she wants to take it away as well. I do not intend to cheat on her also, nor with any other future girlfriend I have, so that was never a solution. I love my girlfriend a lot, however, but I consider it as an important thing in a relationship. It's one of the few things that differentiates your girlfriend from your girl best friends. Like I said earlier, just to add, and weapons fall into that category. I also feel that joining the military is a good way for me to make a small positive difference in this world or at least country (one of my goals in life). That being said

I'm 16 and over this past summer i fell pretty hard for this girl, she likes me too. i started hanging out with them again and eventually asked her out. we went out for about 3 weeks before she decided to end it at the beginning of a camping trip and ended up ruining my weekend(i basically sat at the campsite and listened to music on my phone trying to organize my thoughts again). she told me i was to much like family to her and that she wasn't ready for a relationship which i believed. i asked her if we could try again when she's ready and she said yes sounding like she was waiting for me to ask that magical question. then about a week later i find out from girls who were like sisters to me that she liked another guy and thats why she broke up with me. that made me pissed, sad and confused at the same time. pissed cause she lied to me, sad cause i lost her and confused cause not only she said yes to me asking if we could try again, but because she said it enthusiastically like she was waiting for me to ask. i don't have any contact with them, ignore their texts and phone calls for a while until i feel like i'm over her. for about a week we start hanging out again but abby was basically treating me like the plague so i asked if we could talk and she kinda exploded yelling ""about what?!??!"" a hundred times. so i said nothing to anyone, turned around, i'm mad at her"". she gets up and goes straight to abby and tells her that. next thing i know she's crying and i'm sitting inside watching tv with they're parents thinking in m head ""what did you expect to happen when you treat me like that?"" until i decide to leave. i decided to not see them for a while cause its hard for both of us and haven't seen them in almost a month. it sucks now cause i used to spend all my time with that familly and now i just feel so lonely. i hang out with my guy friends still but not often outside of school. and one more detail is that i can literally tell abby off and walk out the door while everyone looks the other way, i'm not that type of person.

Now for the part i need advice on....

there was another girl and i had a major crush on her during freshmen year. i think she liked me too cause she would always be messing with me but nothing ever happened cause when ever i asked myself if i liked her i just buried the question. well i went to another school the next year and haven't seen her since. then one of my friends who still goes to that school texted me he told her something(wouldn't tell me what) that she asked for my number and he gave it to her. that happened while i was going out with abby so i had to tell her that i had a girlfriend. somewhere in there i told her that i had a crush on her during freshmen year and she was really cool about it all. in fact when abby broke up with me she was the second person i texted which i kick myself for doing cause it doesn't seem right to go to her about when she knows i had a crush on her. we still text each other and she calls me names playfully like she used to and even texts me winky smilies... alot actually. and now i'm starting to fall for her again like i did in freshmen year but we haven't seen each other in 2 years(trust me i have been inviting her to stuff but its usually a few days before the event and she has plans) and i'm both scared to ask her out and don't want to until we see each other again

I didn't realized he looked like Dr. Who until we were having coffee and he smiled
he's a mathematician, lives w parents, still in grad school, has a mediocre job...

Dislikes:
he knows nothing about fashion
I don't think he has ever been in a serious relationship
first kiss was not good
he's skinny (i'm curvy, butt..etc)
he's all about ""massages"" 

Dilemma
he wants to be ""friends w benefits"" w/o sex... O_o
I think i fell hard for him...i don't even understand the logic... I think of him from the moment i wake up until i go to bed. 
He doesn't call

1344734080.0,y2n5u,Reflections on living and dying for love,Gravizt,5,1,2,"Throughout my life there are a few words I have heard time and time again, make no sense at all.

“I would die for you.”

It sounds so romantic, but thinking of it, its evil. It forces the other part into caring. Its a cowardly option in a possibly hard situation. Picture the following. You and your loved one are in a position where only one of you can survive. There is no way out of it. One of you have to die. Every proper gentleman would of course at this point immediately say his tearful goodbyes and face death for his love, but is this really the honorable thing to do? 

Let us work on the assumption that there is no afterlife. When you live, you're dead. Nothing more. No reincarnation, no heavenly kingdom, no nothing. This is what we shall believe, at least for now. Too set more guidelines, you are both madly in love. Your world consists solely of each other, and you are the most important aspects in each others lives. For most people, but is this what would really happen?

For those of you who have been unfortunate enough to loose a loved one, will know the pain that goes with it. The days following, filled with sadness, or even anger. Regretting not spending more time together. Thinking of all the things you wished you could have said before it was too late. Making up the conversations you could have had together. All the crying, and thoughts of what should have happened. Now imagine, all of this depression, coupled with the feeling that its all your fault. Knowing that if it wasn't for you, if only it hadn't been for you. This person, you and only you. Nothing else is to blame. How long would you take too get over it? Months, and you are planning on throwing away your life. No

Now of course you are not living in this condition, or half a second of intelligent thought, took the honorable way, and died for who you love. You feel nothing. You don't think any more. You don't even exist. Because you where a honorable person. You gave your life so that your loved one could live on. Was it worth it, only to inflict such pain on them? You didn't take the honorable path, you took the easy path, and because of it

We began by establishing that there is no afterlife, but now there is a difference. Now they know, that you are in a better place, and they are stuck here, knowing it was because of them. Do you think it brings them happiness to know that you are fine and in heaven? No, it does not. They are still alone, you are still dead, before they die, that would be a one way ticket to hell, and waiting for your loved one to return too you. Again you took the easy way out

Dying for someone is easy.

Now lets envision another scenario. What if your life was empty. What if you had nothing at all. All you had in your life was depression. You never had anything but depression. Depression, and there was not.

Again you plummet into the same old depression that has been your life for as long as you can remember. You are left with nothing, you just want to end it. Why wouldn't you? You have nothing left to live for. You tasted happiness, and now it is gone. Every day is a nightmare. Just living is a pain, and death would be sweet, sweet relief. It makes sense. Nothing is left but pain, why not get rid of it? Let me tell you why. Let me tell you why you live through the pain. The only reason you are still alive, is because upon ending the relationship, saying it would crush them. Imagine your only reason to live is to not make your previous partner unhappy. Imagine caring for someone to the point of pulling yourself through mental and physical torment, you don't feel any more. Let me explain. If you kill yourself for someone else, knowing you've let the love of your life down. You die knowing you've disappointed them. You die

This is the position I find myself in.

Sorry for the long backstory but here's the point of this post. Ever since I got out of my relationship with Allison I have not have had a girlfriend. I will either do the one night stand thing or if a girl shows that she likes me I would just taper off hanging out untill I just stopped calling. Until I started hanging out with Anna. I have known her for a long time but through friends. We started hanging out a lot and I realized that I am actually getting feelings for her and maybe I finally got past whatever I was going through and am ready for a gf. 

Last weekend both Jess and Anna invited me to go out. I got convince to go hang out with Jessi just because she a good friend even tho I really wanted to see my crush Anna. While hanging out with jess she thanks me for coming up, I go and see Jessi and all my feelings for her just broke down the gates. So what the fuck.

tl;dr  Like this girl Jess in high school. Didnt work out. Got another girlfriend for 2 years. After our break up avoided all commitment type relationships with girls. Years later meet a girl (Anna) who makes me ""crush"" again. See my old friend Jess who I have seen regularly but not since Anna. Realize that I really am in love with her.

We've had a talk and I indirectly asked her if she liked me (she knows I have feelings for her). As you might guess, and the thing is that I noticed her looking at me a lot when I'm not paying attention.

For as long as I can remember, in fact, that I didn't even have sex until I was 22, and it was with someone that I genuinely cared about and intended to be with long-term. Unfortunately, later in the relationship, some large incompatiblities started coming out of the woodwork.

My issue is that I am constantly surrounded by the mediocre rabble of people looking to drink themselves stupid, it turned out that I was completely mistaken. My most recent mistake went so far as to tell me that she believed that she had found the person that she was going to marry (me), only to break-up with me, on Valentine's Day, so that she could go drink, act a fool, puke on herself, without feeling guilty. I saw the signs that she wasn't the person who she wanted me to believe that she was

The point that I'm trying to get at, than EVER experience the incomparable pain of heartache. Yet my heart longs for that significant other. But where is a person such as myself supposed to seek the right person? As far as morality goes, I should perhaps look at church. Being that I'm an Atheist though, that's pretty much out of the picture. Being that I don't drink, and am very unfond of the places where people gather, i.e. bars and clubs, that further narrows my options. Furthermore, and honestly extremely oblivous to the signs and hints that women give

I don't want to be a superficial prick

The real problem is that I am coming to the realization, the odds of me finding my exact dream girl (which are very high considering that I have a very specific type (short, chubby, nerdy, redheads) that is already a very small demographic. I can't help it though, I just can't get over my preferences. 

How do you guys balance this? Do you inevitably cave into the pressure of finding love despite your true attractions? I just feel like this isn't the right thing to do. In fact more and more these days I feel like attraction isn't necessarily superficial (unless it is founded on such grounds) but rather a fundamental part of two people's compatibility with each other: if you're not attracted to each other on some level then the relationship will lack the passion it needs to perpetuate itself.

SHORT VERSION: A girl I really like just reactivated her facebook after I wrote on her sister's wall about how I hope this girl is doing well. I have high hopes that she reactivated it for me! :D

Alright, I REEEAAALLLY like her. I can't say I love her because I've never been the least bit intimate with her (I've never dated her or anything). We've been friends practically since birth, but when we were around 10, our families stopped hanging out as frequently, so I didn't get to see her very often.

Well, She's extremely funny (That's kinda bitter-sweet cuz she's a heck of a lot funnier than me, so I can't really impress her with too many cunning jokes or anything). She also has the same religious beliefs as me and she's big into love/romance stories. Oh, and of course she's like MEGA cute.

Anyways, turns out just today she reactivated her facebook account!

That could mean absolutely nothing, but texting/calling out of the blue just seems too creepy since I haven't talked to her in so long. 

The only downer is that I was extremely awkward in high school (when we hung out) and had really low self esteem. Now

1303623406.0,gw5se,foolish soul,lost_fool,7,0,3,"I find myself in an bad  place. i have been with the same woman for 21 years plus. she is my best friend and i love her. i can not say that i am in love with her. she means the world to me but she and i are not close on an emotional or physical level. It has been this way from the start. Well not exactly the start. the first 9 months were wonderful. what does this say about me? i am not in a position to really answer that question. i am here and not on the outside looking in like you are. you have the benefit of being outside of the emotional turmoil i am in.


The relationship from early on slipped into one of extreme comfort. we are both similar in political


this started out as a pursue and hunt relationship. she the hunter. i was a year out of a 6 year relationship that ended very badly. I was looking to date


she worked a lot and that is what i first attributed it to. she became distant to me. physical contact backed way off and she spent less and less time sharing with me. when i pushed her, shut down ,focused on my work. I was a student and could easily divert the energy. Of note, i had a troubled childhood, abusive alcoholic step father and my own family exploded after i left home,. I watched, as the man retired the family scattered to the win. We are not close


When she said things like needy and clingy, i am broken. i am clingy and needy and i need to get it together. i had been working on issues up to this point so that was a natural thing for me to do.


18 years passed and the distance grew. we are still compatible in many ways. the emotional relationship is strained to say the best. she is happy with this arrangement and other then the occasional attempts on my part to bridge the gap we live 2 separate lives. then something horrible happened. my brothers child develops autism and i do what i do best. since i have a fair among of both biology and social sciences in my back ground


i am reading through the literature i am thinking, well still maybe a little me, but the things i have been trying to work on that i am making no ground, they are not because of me. she has this, this thing. she is like this because of aspirers. it was a relief. i felt light as a feather knowing that i was not broken to the extent i thought i was, what she was telling me was not messed up, i am simply a normal human primate. hugs, fabric types
i take the information to her. here i say, you are in here. all the things you have told me about your childhood, all the ways you are, all the ways our relationship is broken. all in this book and these papers. isn't this exciting! Now we can move forward. Sure i will read it. she never did. i would ask, what did you think. nothing. for the first year i was very hopeful. then it dawned on me, even though i had the answer, it really was only the answer for me. it only told me that i was not completely to blame here. it did not matter really, or maybe just a deep rooted psychological issue


Once this realization hit me the real trouble started. I was angry, they would look at me like i was crazy. you are the normal one here, they would say. you didn't know this? I was floored . my thoughts were to try and find a way out of the marriage of 10 years, the relationship of 20 or so years. Well this was not at first. It was fix things then it was find a way out. 


this second option happened slowly and i was not aware of this happening. I reached out to find people online, my new friends would tell me that this was not a good situation and that i deserved to be happy. that i needed to have comfort.  they thought it was obvious i was in pain. then as i thought about it more and more i realized i was not only i pain but i was boarder line depressed. I need to fix things but i could not do it. It was up to her to adjust her behavior, I had adjusted mine for too long and it was obvious to me that i was not in a heathy situation.


Slowly i found myself not accommodating her behavior anymore. i was making less compromises. it was horrible for our marriage. fight increased and the intensity evolved on an exponential curve. she would still try and push her agenda or make sure things were the way she had to have them and would say no. no more. i reached out to friends old and new and got support but i could never see a path that would allow her to land on her feet. Since she was not working


But since I am the sole earner she would suddenly be tossed into a bad economy after being unemployed for 10 years. Not fair. I promised her to take care of her before i realized that there was no way that i was ever going to get what i needed in the relationship. back when i was hopeful of things getting better. she needed me


After two years of pushing and trying to prod her into going back to school for a masters in a field she could use outside of a standard workplace, i realized i was getting nowhere except causing both to be miserable. If  i shut my mouth, the house would be peaceful. since i could not find a path to fix things, this seemed like the best path. I would simply go down doing the right thing then the twist. I think i have fallen in love with one of my friends. she is very much in a similar situation she and i have had many conversations about our situations. we have acknowledged our affection for each other and how things would be better together for each of us if we could be together. i want to take care of her, like she wants to care for me. Fortunately for me, she can say no to me when i say, i will be close to where you live. lets meet for coffee. 

""I can’t afford the complication of meeting you in person"" was her last response. ""If your wife was not in the picture
 

Now why am i writing all this down you might ask. i have to get it off my chest. no one knows except us two. we seek each other out for the affection
I know there will be strong opinions on both sides. i know the arguments. i know the right and the wrong. i needed to get it off my chest so that i can atlas say to myself



EDT:  i realized that did not double return the initial post. sorry for that. I have exposed all to my wife and my love has left from the horror of  being in love with a married man.

I've dreamed of the day where I'd find the love of my life, and live happily ever after together being hopelessly in love. I've dreamed of this my entire life but I've never found true love or even false love. I've never even held a girls hand before. 

As a 21 year old, and I do. I feel very lonely and some times I feel like I've given up. A lot of people tell me that some day the right girl will find me, but that's never happened. I suffer from social anxiety which makes it very difficult for me to meet anyone because I'm always telling myself in my head that the people I'm seeing when I go outside, are all thinking of how weird and socially awkward I am, which makes me even more socially awkward making girls not want anything to do with me. 

Deep down, and all I want to do is fall in love with a beautiful girl and give her everything I have, because she'll be the only thing in my life that makes life worth living.

For the last two years I've been a shut in because of my social anxiety and it's only gotten worse as time goes on. Now it seems impossible for me to socialize with anyone. I just become more socially awkward by the minute.

This guy. Seriously.

A couple of weeks ago I was talking to my sister about how I was starting feeling a little lonely. We spoke about how I missed having someone to hold, etc. Basically a companion. What made it more complicated for me was that I just moved to a new place and I was/am having a bit of trouble meeting new people.

She suggested that I go on the internet. She had done it too and even met her current boyfriend on there! Great

So I signed up to a dutch chatsite. I took some time to fill out the profile and I uploaded a photo. I entered the chatroom and was almost immediately grossed out by all the private messages I got.

I quit that shit right away. Didn't think of it anymore until I got an email of the website. ""You got a private message!"" I got a message on my profile. Someone found me somehow and messaged me. The message said: ""Hey! I initially looked at your profile because of your photo. You look great. Then I scrolled and noticed your favorite band: Modest Mouse. I nearly fell off my chair when I saw that! It's so unusual that people here like them

I looked at his profile and wow, dark eyes, tall. Fantastic taste in music, great taste in film, his message made me smile. Awesome! Too bad he lives about three hours away, but we'll just talk, right? So I replied, I had to reinstall it to actually talk to him!) and we started talking. We hit it off right away and had a lot of things in common.

Fast forward to today. We take our planners every week and find out when we both have time to talk to eachother. We talk with the webcam on and have a great time. He thinks I'm awesome

""I can be quick and honest about this. When I see you I'm like god damnit! This girl is badass. She's cute, is spontaneous, sexy cool, dresses fantastically. Wow."" 

That's what he told me today and I was just flabber gasted. I know we haven't been talking for too long but I feel like something HAS to happen. I've never experienced such chemistry, but I'm really feeling something here. I don't know if it's weird.

Basically what I want to know is

What would you do in my situation?

1342246123.0,wjg63,I've Never Told Anyone This Before,z3m,5,1,22,"Growing up in San Francisco with hippy parents I spent a lot of time questioning their authority.  Whenever I had a question my mother couldn't answer she would tell me to ask the ocean.  So

I'm atheist and I don't particularly subscribe to that hippy crap but I believe in a transference of energy and I was willing to give it a try.  For months I went to the beach to ask the ocean to send me a husband and on the harvest equinox of that year I met the love of my life.  My mother ALWAYS had a bon fire on Ocean Beach for the harvest equinox and here this woman shows up - a belly dancer chanting native american incantations and burning boxes full of old medical records from her recently late husband.

Late - towards the end of the night - her son came to find her.  He had been up and down the beach 2x and had finally given up.  He crashed our bonfire just to get a beer and it just happened to be the fire his mother had crashed as well.  It turned out he worked 4 blocks from my job and he lived 4 blocks from my apartment.  Within weeks it was so obvious it was scary.

And 5 years later here I find myself with him in Seattle.  In our perfect little one bedroom apartment, we don't often fight and when we do it's not that bad, the sex is great, the no fucked up drugs or alcoholism going on, everything is great and we want to travel and have weddings and babies and love forever.

But

Don't jump to conclusions.  I've never cheated on my boyfriend - let's call him ""Cody"".  He's amazing and I would never betray his trust...  Unless I already have.  I don't know anymore.

See

He was a successful graphic designer living just 2 blocks away.  Tall, there were endless obstacles.  He was getting out of a relationship and so was I.  I was also touring a lot and out of town.  There just never seemed to be a good time...

One night after Cody and I had only been dating a few weeks and we took mushrooms together.  After an amazing day full of fireworks and romantic music in Dolores Park we went back to his place where I stupidly told him I loved him.  He flipped his shit and kicked me out.  

On the humiliated walk home (just a few block down from Twin Peaks)

""Thank god I ran into you!  I've been outside your apartment for hours!  Where have you been?""

""What?""

""I love you.  You need to marry me.""

""What's going on?  I need to sit down.""  And as Casey confessed his love for me I looked at his flower sadly and told him that I'd met someone and though he had pushed me away this night I felt he was The One.  Casey was heartbroken.  I was heartbroken.  I wondered if I was mistaken then.

Then the economy crashed and we all lost out jobs

Here I found myself without Cody and without Casey, and sorrowful for what he could not provide.  I just wanted to be rid of him, to tell you the truth; but I couldn't bare to abandoned the man who had once been my knight in shining armor, no matter how dirty his face.

As Casey remained homeless and struggling Cody and I reunited and I found a job.  We got a place together in the sunset and occassionally I ran into Casey while working

Eventually Cody and I moved to Seattle for more job opportunities and cheaper rent.  We both got good jobs and a nice little apartment.  I even went to medical school and he got a job working for a world famous artist.  Things couldn't be better.

But, Texas, Arizona.  He calls me all the time.  We talk all the time.  And every time we talk he tells me how he loves me.  How I'm the one that got away.  He leaves me messages asking me to marry him.  And I still call him.

I feel guilty.  I love Cody.  But, who came to me in the middle of the night to take me to vegas to elope.  Casey who calls me just to tell me he thinks I'm amazing.  That he dreams of my face and the scent of the nape of my neck.

Where is that?

My best friend tells me that Casey is appealing because he's not real.  He's just a voice on a phone from far away.  In reality - in a relationship things would be different and I know they would be

When I talk to Casey I feel special in a way that Cody doesn't make me feel and then I feel guilty, Casey loved me before Cody and I loved Casey before Cody.

Is what I'm doing wrong?  Is this awful?  What am I supposed to do about this?  I feel like I'm cheating on the love of my life with the love of my life.  I don't know what to do.

EDIT: So, holding me, telling me he loves me and today he told me ""I don't want you to talk anymore than you have to.""  For the first time he is sleeping on the couch and he is moving in with a friend tomorrow.  It's all so fast.  I mean, I guess it's for the best?  I don't know.  I just feel terrible.  I can see our whole relationship flashing before my eyes.  Seeing him on the beach, at the bon fire, summer in San Francisco on hippy hill, the raccoon in our living room, the first trip to Seattle where we slept on my best friends sofa for 2 weeks.  All gone.  It's just so over I can't describe it.  I feel so empty.  Like no one is ever going to want me.  I can't believe I have to work tomorrow.  This is awful. ",t5_2qhnh,True

To start things off, with my Dad being the drug addict)

Basically we met in school. We spend time together in between classes

Soooooo
Our school is run by nuns. A very catholic school that has very strict policies on campus. We have been ""caught"" several times. Not doing anything dirty though

Her aunt and my mom would be called to the Principal's office (which was a nun) and tell them to make our love come to a halt. 

Surprisingly her aunt and my mom would defend us saying 'Please understand that our kids are in love and maybe it would be cool if we still see each other since we are not hurting anyone nor the school (to some degree) ' So she accepts.

Her friends would tease us all day

We never had a fight. In our whole 10 month relationship there wouldn't be any. Because we would always talk it out. It seemed that we were pretty mature with things. Then we took the next step.
We would kiss, dance to Rufio - One Slowdance and Toploader - Dancing in the Moonlight. And also make love to each other. It seemed as though everything was perfect. Until I had to graduate.

I remembered it like it was yesterday. It was the first time I introduced her to my whole family. And my family was so excited. (as me being the eldest) They loved her so much that they let me take the car and drive her home.

Then came college. I barely had time for her because of my homework and projects. Still I go out to see her. I would bring all of my stuff and we would help each other out. We would still go to movies and she would also come by our home just to go on top of our roof and lie there and watch the stars talking about our future.

After some time her friends would get in her head. (In my opinion) They would tell her that I don't love her and that I see other women in college. They would also tell her that the only thing I was after her was just for the sex. How mean is that...

She texted me if all of this was true. Ofcourse not

So I gave her some space. I would text on mornings and evenings to greet her Good Morning Take Care and Good Night I Love You. 
So I head over to facebook just to look at her and all of a sudden her status was Single. Which made me text her this 'I didn't know you were single

Somehow it kinda pissed her. She broke up with me. One mistake of mine is this did not even bother me as I always thought to myself that we would still be together after this. (kind of a bump in a relationship thing) Being the stupid me she told me months ago she has two accounts. One for friends and me and one for her family. With different statuses. I did not realize this immediately. 

I would wait outside her apartment. Just look at her window. Waiting she would look outside and find me still being there. 

I would drink just to numb the pain. It was the definition of hell for me.
I would cry to my mother while drunk

4 years have passed. I could never let go. Lot's of girls would flirt with me yet I would still not be interested. She had a really big impact on my life. I would ask myself what the hell is wrong with me. I wanted to move on but somehow I could just not. I would text her

Then something came up. I decided I wouldn't be a pussy and maybe if I go to where she lives and tell her all about this I might have a chance. It was all planned. A couple of friends of mine were coming. They were very supportive. They kept on telling me to never give up since they pretty much knew how much she meant to me. Then an unexpected call comes. It was her. Apparently my mom being so worried told her of my plans. 

Here are some of the conversation. Bella I love you and I don't know why, you have to stay away. I used to love you but I guess all stories come to an end. And if you really love me then you would respect my decision for you not to come and just leave me alone. Let me be. Or if you want we could just be friends.

I was devastated. I couldn't. I declined the friendship cause I know it would just hurt me more. Though I respected her wishes. Yet I still love her for some reason. 

The 5th year is coming up. The 5th year where we were together no more. Still I wait. That maybe someday she would change her mind. 
Maybe I am now crazy

Isabella you are the love of my life and no one can take that away. &lt;3

So here's the story: I met this girl a few months ago when we started school..she's awesome, *ad nauseum*.  Sometimes (admittedly usually after a few drinks) she'll cuddle a little, or give me these great big hugs, or we'll play with each others' hands.  We get lunch all the time, get together to watch movies.  A few days ago, we lay in the grass watching the clouds.  Now here are the problems: she's just broke up with her girlfriend a few weeks ago.  Yep, you read that right, so I don't know whether to interpret what she says/does as overtures of romantic interest, we may be working together for the next few years) any romantic feelings.  Do I tell her how I feel?  It doesn't even matter if she shoots me down

Thanks reddit~

tl;dr: crazy about a girl who may or may not be into me.  she's also gay.  do I tell her?



UPDATE: Well, it's weird, if it's just me and her she'll be super affectionate.  It's nice.  Don't know what's really up or going on, but I guess I'm glad to have a friend who cares that much about me.  Ah well.

Today, yeah, and it hurt, but I've been through worse. No, what hurts is how long I had this attachment to her. From the day I met her I liked her, and maybe a little bit more than that. As I learned more about her and got to know her better, I grew an admiration and attraction to her. It didn't hurt that I think she's beautiful, sort of recognizing the friend zone. Hell

Anyway, and confess my feelings. She seems kind of stunned for a moment, and an awkward silence ensues between us. She tells me she'll think about it, and leaves. This gives me a sort of exhilarating feeling, as I'm already almost sure she likes me back. Monday rolls around and I see her again. End of the day outside of the school again, I find her and ask if she has a number that I can text to talk to her. She obliges, and we both go home. I start texting her, but wanted to wait a while for my ex to get over me because they were friends. With this, and didn't even realize what exactly was happening at the time. I still remember how that felt.

When I get home

The next few weeks are a bit of a blur. Not that much changed between us. We hang out a bit more at school. We hold hands occasionally. Maybe that was my mistake.

A couple of weeks go by. We eventually go on an actual date. Nothing big

Date's over, past relationships and stuff. Eventually we start kissing. Kissing and kissing. Nothing more than that, but it was still great. This is also the first time I really hear from her sister; she called because she wanted my girlfriend to come home. Her sister is a silly little one. All I really heard was  ""Liiiaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaar."" It was really funny, actually. We laughed about it. Eventually my dad comes home, so we have to part ways. I kiss her one last time.

She's a really busy person. She never really had more free time, warm weather to send rain and wind our way. No date. That was last Thursday.

I ask her when she might have time for another date. Her answer: this Wednesday and Thursday. I offer that we should go on both

Sunday night rolls around. I ask her if she's still up for Wednesday and Thursday. She tells me that she actually has to help a teacher with stuff after school those days, and I tell her that I love her. I'd actually been doing this for a while, but she had some issue where she really didn't want to say it yet. Not until she was sure that she meant it. This didn't bother me at all; I'm a pretty understanding guy. But something different happens. She asks how I can say that to someone who ""Can't"" say it back. I answer with the same reason that I gave above. I tell her that I was more than willing to wait.

""Don't expect too much."" Uh oh. I knew this wasn't good. I ask her what she means by that, then, to make her want to tell me she loves me. With this, we go to bed.

I was worried last night. Really worried. I thought and thought about what I should do. The only thing that I could really figure was that I should stop saying that I loved her for a while. Obviously it distressed her a bit

Morning of today, hang out with friends and girlfriend, all that jazz. She was quieter than usual today, but I don't really take notice.

After school today (Which is less than an hour ago from when I'm writing). We're standing by her car

""I've been thinking about it

I'm at a bit of a loss for words. I can't say I didn't really expect it. But it still hurt. I do my best to stay stoic while I look into her beautiful,"" I say. Maybe that was a mistake. Maybe I should've resisted, maybe even begged. Work out a deal, something. But that's over. I tell her that I've been through worse, which is true. My first girlfriend cheated on me. That was such a horrible feeling, so this didn't hurt nearly as much. At least she was upfront about it. We have this awkward little moment, kind of making small talk for a little while. Eventually she has to go. She comes in, I draw my arm down hers

I have a pretty big realization at this point. I realize that even though I still want her, go to school and have fun with her, that somewhere, in some part of her mind, no matter the circumstances, she wanted to break up with me. I don't think that I'd be comfortable knowing that if we for some reason got back together. But I still want to.

What do I do now? Do I just move on, do what I can to get her back? It seems like a pretty sudden decision to me. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe I was the mistake.

You know what hurts the worst? I realized something. She's a grade up from me; a senior. Not much longer and I might not ever see her again. I can't just let that happen. I can't be so emotionally invested in something like this just to let it slip away. I have to do something. I can't let go of her forever.

Yea yea

Okay long story short: I am a man and some girl fall in love for me and I don't feel that I do not even feel that I really love her. For some reason we used webcam almost whole the day when we have a day off. The real problem is the she is a bit far away. She lives like in another country. So I guess I could just block her and move along. But that feels wrong somehow. I don't want to make her sad but I guess it is better that she finds someone nearby. 

Yes, but that is another story. And no, she do not know that.

So yea,,False,,t5_2qhnh,False,,True

I met her in university. She wasn't in my classes or anything, trying to learn the crash-course dance moves being given. Some partners were really not digging the stuff at all and clearly wanted to leave,some were just not my type. But this one cute one, asian with a preppy-geek kind of style to her was the most fun partner, leaving both of us laughing at each other's clumsiness. I remember regret when our few minutes of dancing together was over. But after the open house was finished, I seeked her out before she left and asked her if she was planning on signing up and coming to the weekly classes. When she said yes, the next step was obvious for me. I'll refer to her as Miss H.

So over the next semester, I would get close to over the next 8-10 months or so. We briefly dated over the summer, but I went across the country to work a summer job where the other half of my family lived. At first, we kept in touch via letters, emails, and lengthy phone calls. But then she called me and gave me a Dear John statement. When I came home, Miss C and I were effectively done talking.

So through all this and while that school year continued, Miss H backed off to the good ol' Friend Zone.

In the aftermath of the Dear John phone call, and fertilized by near-daily conversation. I soon realized that we'd rarely gotten together outside of swing dance classes. We agreed to do more things together when I came home at summer's end.

Okay. This is getting super lengthy and it's also late...I don't even know if anyone will read this. But it's almost therapeutic to write our story.
