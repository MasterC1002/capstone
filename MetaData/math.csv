-Pause, Play

-Mouse over display to tell you what number each arc represents

I have received a ton of suggestions and ideas, let me know!  Also, this is actually my first javascript/html5 project, so if you are more experienced with these and have suggestions about the coding, feel free to let me know, thanks.

She was young, and she was absolutely brilliant. She was an excellent teacher often forced to bow down to bureaucratic interests, to the loss of everyone involved. But like any teacher worth her pay, she never stuck to the lesson plan, never restricted her teaching to what would be on the AP test.

When I was in her class there was a two-page comic strip on the wall next to her desk, featuring my teacher as Math Girl. Math Girl went off on an adventure to rescue Dr. Andrew Wiles from his Chinese captors, flying her mathcopter through Hilbert space to reach China in 8 attoseconds. Recognizing that here I had found a math teacher who knew far more than her teaching position would suggest, far more than any of my previous teachers, I stayed after school, between classes, talking with her, working with her on multivariable calculus problems that were a challenge for both of us

She made quite an impact on my life, and her frequent sympathizing with our frustrations with the administration. My fellow classmates are now attending the American University in Paris, St. John's in New York, UPenn, Princeton, Rice, Cornell, and even in those places their knowledge of statistics is remarkable among their peers

The internet needs a place to go and learn advanced maths

I'm going to try my best to do it. I bought a FlipVideo

But I need your help. I am finishing my BS in Mathematics in December

I will be teaching all of my courses on University of Reddit

I want to start this now

I am prepared to teach 6 courses:  
Introduction to Advanced Mathematics  
Elementary Analysis: Calculus Theory I  
Elementary Analysis: Calculus Theory II  
Complex Variables: Introduction to Complex Analysis  
Introduction to Abstract Algebra I  
Introduction to Abstract Algebra II

I appreciate any help or advice you can provide me; I want this to succeed more than I want to avoid hurt feelings

I just graduated with a 4.0 at a great (top 10) school as a Math major. I've been a TA for two and a half years

But I won't.

Top graduates like me who would love to  be teachers, actuarial sciences, software development, and professional schools (medicine, law, etc.) It's not even about selling out. It's about wanting to get paid even a remotely reasonable salary to attract us top graduates. It's about wanting to be respected in a field. It just boils down to wanting a good job, like any reasonable human being would want.

Teaching is not that job. Instead, and hence people lose faith in the education system, further perpetuating this vicious cycle. Then, people want to slash education budgets even more.

Obviously

I wish I could become a teacher. I just want what you want as well; a job I love that can support a family and garner the respect that a teacher truly deserves. It's unfortunate that teaching will not fulfill this.

I passed out the first of four color mandelbrot pics (I made copies for each of them) and they went ape.  Excited yelling that had to be quieted by the teacher, where we zoomed (and they laughed when I called the second bulb of the set the ""butt"") and I pointed out the miniature copy of the set embedded therein.  They GOT IT.  They went NUTS.  (I got some good color pictures, and made bright color copies)  After picture three of four went out, I had to tell them that their teacher would pass out the fourth after I left, because they were getting bouncy excited out of control.  Questions, questions, questions.  Then I mentioned some research problem I worked on this summer, and they wanted to know all about it

No activities, and a teacher who didn't mind that we went over time.

It would have made life so much easier. All of these statements come with the disclaimer ""if your course is anything like mine""

- Every class has roughly 100 techniques, and just fucking *know* them. Roughly 25 of them are things that are your bread and butter, and will use again and again for questions in the course. Know them inside and out, until you dream about them in your sleep. These are the things that you're paying your expensive-ass tuition for, and you're only cheating yourself if you don't know them.

- Show up to the damn lectures and practice classes. It doesn't matter how sharp you are: catching up on lectures is an uphill battle, and it's way better to miss a lecture than a practice class. Practice classes help you, well, practice, and are generally far more efficient at increasing your proficiency.

- In first year

- Don't let your eyes glaze over when lecturers show their work. It's easy to ""skip to the end"" and get the result of the theorem

1292801310.0,eohrr,"To everyone who posts about ""learning more math""---",hbetx9,440,108,135,"I've seen so many of these posts that I'm just baffled. Here is the skinny. First of all

(1) Discrete mathematics: This includes equivalence relations (probably one of the most important things for you understand ever)

(2) Linear Algebra: Again, and this stuff comes up everywhere. Many mathematicians have said many of the biggest proofs in the world come down to ""just some linear algebra"". The major point here is to understand that there is only one vector space for each dimension over a field and understand how a linear transformation becomes a matrix only after a choice of basis. Here equivalence relations come up again!

(3) Differential equations: Unless you're focused on engr math or serious applied stuff

(4) Complex Analysis: Yes, do it. 

Okay

(1) Abstract Algebra -- Grab any book read about groups, vector spaces and modules. Proofs will be difficult here but work through it. There are so many books here, avoid Lang (good book but not for starting out), Dummit/Foote is okay. As a ugrad I had a good time with Rotman's An introduction to abstract algebra. 

(2) Analysis -- Grab Baby Rudin. No seriously, go!

(3) Topology -- Grab Introduction to Topology by J. Munkries. Its so well written it might as well be a coffee table book. 

There now, or studies Analysis and Differential Equations together or Analysis and Topology. Seeing the links across different topics is important, but I'm just giving the overview here. 

Not every mathematician studies logic deeply and there are LOT of fringe topics that I'm omitting (including some of my favs: Projective Geometry, Combinatorics, Elliptic Curves, Coding theory, Harmonic Analysis, etc). However, none of these are required courses at more than a 1% of programs. 

Stop asking for a ""good book on blah"" or ""I'm a novice and want to learn more"" because these questions are either (1) easy/clear to answer from literally 10 seconds of google/reading older posts or (2) is too vague to be of use. in order for the community to help you, finding a study partner is hard. The latter is what the community should be for, not the former. There is no reason anyone in the world ""has to learn measure theory"" -- period. Or Galois theory, or anything in mathematics, unless you are becoming a mathematician or a professional in a mathematical field (abstract theoretical academic computer science for example, NOT programming/web developing). 

If you're just learning to learn great! Lovely! Pick up a book and start going through it! Don't skip the basics and don't pretend like this is the most important thing ever

As a community we are,  the community was made to eat up stuff like the Collatz Conjecture

**TL;DR** So that we can keep this a place to discuss actual math

**EDIT**: Some people seem to have misunderstood my motives, of *any* level, and we need to discourage things that get in the way of discussion such as ""Hey guys! Sec(c) sounds like sexy, HAHAHA!"" The more we tolerate that kind of behavior, the closer we get to becoming a Reddit cesspool like /r/funny, /r/atheism or f7u12. So I mean mature in the ""I'm a grown-up"" sense, not the ""Mathematically Mature"" one. 

 If some middle-aged guy who hasn't done math since high school notices something interesting while adding some fractions together, I won't complain, but we need to be open to mathematical *dicussion* (of *any* level), and not be a place where people who are looking for karma can post about how silly Taylor Expansions are.

Also, so it's more of a circlejerk than a discussion. And I'm just tired of hearing about the Fibonacci Sequence and the Collatz Conjecture, so I may have been a little short with them. So they're cool as long as it is an actual discussion and not a ""DAE notice that the Fibonacci Sequence is awesome?!"" type of thing.",,False,,t5_2qh0n,,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/s3ejb/a_disturbing_trend_this_is_not_rcasualmath/

One interesting aspect of this theorem, but 2, being the oddest prime, is ultimately responsible for some counterexamples.  Tate was a witness to Wang's discovery:

&gt;Some days later I was with Artin in his office when Wang appeared. He said he had a counterexample to a lemma which had been used in the proof. An hour or two later, that a famous theorem with two published proofs, one of which we had all heard in the seminar without our noticing anything, could be wrong.

Wang's counterexample developed into his thesis.

Ok, tomorrow we are supplying three different schools with over 300 pizzas total.

So...what I could use some help with [**is this.**](http://i.imgur.com/mjKIb.jpg)

Basically, we use a double deck conveyor oven. Each oven can fit 2 pizzas side-by-side. However, the ovens don't like to provide identical results with identical settings, so they are set to different temps and different conveyor speeds. I think I've provided any other required info in the picture. Thank you for any help.

**EDIT: Thanks to DadMcFatherton and everyone for your help.**

I know it's not terribly interesting

The cutter is ""the equalizer"". All slices have to be identical in size

Edit 2: Because some of you might actually find this interesting

To that end, although less intensive and problem-based. 


I believe that there are many here on /r/math who would like to learn something different over the summer

(2) Topology (5)

Prerequisites: mathematical maturity. 

(3) Differential Geometry (5)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-3

(4) Real Analysis (4)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-3

(5) Upper Division Linear Algebra (Inner Product Spaces, Jordan Form, etc.) (10)

Prerequisites: Calculus 1-2

(6) Complex Analysis (3)

* what media (handouts
* what is your level of mathematical education?

**UPDATE:** It seems like one or two people are interested. I'll post again in the summer when it starts up. Since this is an introductory course

A number of people have asked what the prerequisites for this course are. I think the bare minimum would be:

* set theory: know what products, know the paradoxes, know what posets are, know what injections/surjections/bijections are and maybe a bit about cardinals. This is pretty much just language/history and can be picked up in an afternoon or two on Wikipedia.

* algebra: know what vector spaces/linear transformations are, group homomorphisms, etc.), and **understand the concept of isomorphism**

* mathematical maturity: probably the most important; basically remain calm and carry on when all the mathematics you've ever known and loved gets abstracted away into dots and arrows.

Of course, and before learning what modules were).

**Even if you don't have all the prerequisites, and a lot of the time I'll be talking about the ideas / intuition of category theory, which is extremely valuable and ought to be accessible to everyone.

Visualize, they require a 4 or 5 digit passcode to open, and you usually have to hit ENTER to send it. Because of this, the maximum number of keystrokes required to brute force the door code is 50,000 (10,000 combinations from 0000 to 9999 times 4 strokes to enter each one plus an ENTER each time). 

Now take away the ENTER key requirement, and I start guessing numbers in order (1234567), it will open as soon as I hit the 7 key. 

Instinctively, I have guessed 4 unique combinations in 7 keystrokes (1234, 2345, 3456, and 4567), so if each additional keystroke creates a new combination of 4, all possible combos will be entered in 10, *is this possible?* Can the keys be pressed in such an order that no 4-digit combinations can be repeated?

Lots of you probably already know about this but it was the most mind-expanding/mind-bending thing that has happened to me in a math class in awhile

It turns out that instead of looking at the Fibonacci sequence as a recursively defined sequence (apologies for my lack of TeX-fu) 

    f(1)=1

You can look at it as a matrix operation as follows (double apologies for lack of TeX-fu—if anyone reads this

    [1 1] [f(n)  ] =  [f(n+1)]
    [1 0] [f(n-1)]    [f(n)  ]

Which was mind-blowing enough for me. Again this might seem really basic and obvious to a lot of you

    A = [1 1]
        [1 0]

    u = [f(1)] = [1]
        [f(2)]   [1]

The f(n) can just be computed as the top entry of A^n-2 u

f(n) = (√5)((1+√5)/2)^n - (√5)((1-√5)/2)^n

Which made me go *what*??? So instead of a recursively defined Fibonacci sequence

Please, interested parties, graduate students, etc, etc, understand this. There is no single area of mathematics that is 'better' or more 'special' than any other. Its fine to get excited by some tantalizing idea that someone exposes you to and to learn more, I think that is what this community is about. But, I would like to discourage the following behavior. Don't just follow something because it got 'name dropped'. Meaning, you are not getting yourself better prepared for grad school by learning the definition of a measure

There is no short cut to mathematics and no holy grail. Each of these 'fancy' theories are designed for specific purposes. If you don't have the background or the aim

Please, do a reading course with a faculty member at your school. Don't just post a question like ""where can I learn really cool awesome world changing math in 5 secs"" here after only a couple minutes thought and no reading. Save yourself the trouble. 

Better yet

[Pythagorean triples](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_triple)

[Dual spaces](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_space) are incredibly important and are usually not covered at most undergraduate linear algebra classes. 

How about understanding [Green's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green's_theorem) and differential forms or the failure thereof on the punctured plane (for example) from the perspective of [de Rham theory](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Rham_cohomology)?

Have you thought about classic problems related to [Analytic Continuation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analytic_continuation)? 

All of these topics (and many many more!) can be phrased accessibly to undergraduates and can be viewed as the important principles guiding the biggest current theories being studied now (mondronomy, Riemann Hypothesis, problems concerning various machineries and cohomology theories, etc etc). 

I'm sorry, bigger and even more unaccessible. Your program is not necessarily deficient if it does not offer certain topics  like categories or measures. There just isn't a short cut in mathematics, and all these special big theories are best appreciated when one has attempted to understand the root problems in their core context. 

TL;DR: Get good at the basics and learn more about the basic theory instead of spending a semester or wasting time learning definitions about abstract mathematical tools that won't help you in graduate school! In other words

Downvote away.

4. To enable the properties above, or any such 'silly' things. The lack of proof by contradiction does not mean you don't have proof of negation; saying that P is false because assuming it leads to contradiction is valid. Additionally, you can get classical logic back in multiple ways. Being constructive isn't bad: when was the last time you heard a category theorist say ""To prove that this diagram commutes, let us assume that it does not...""?

1247511881.0,90ts0,Is this trick for dividing by 7 popularly known?,jokeheads,227,58,37,"I've always had a knack for mental math. When I was in middle school I was at a restaurant and my waiter was dividing 5 digit numbers by 1 digit numbers (e.g. 17695 / 4) faster than we could put it into a calculator. Of course, .0)

I began to do what he did

The first thing you need to know is that 1/7 = .142857 (repeating, 3/7, ... , 6/7.

Also notice that the 6 numbers are different. 1,8,5, and 7. 

1/7 = .142857, 4/7 = .571428, 5/7 = .714285, 6/7 = .857142 (All repeating). 

The trick: of the 6 numbers 1,5,7,8, 1/7 has a certain sequence. 2/7 has the SAME SEQUENCE, but shifted over to the 2nd highest digit (2). (.285714, which is .142857 shifted over to where the 2 starts). 3/7 is the same, so .571428..etc.

I told him I would take a picture and see if the internet could help me to understand so i could at least chat with him about it.

I know it has to do with groupings of numbers that add up to another number. He gave me an example by placing 6 marbles on the counter and showing me the different sets of marbles that add up to 6. 1, 1, 1, 1, or 2, 1, 1, 1

There are some tutorials and books that deal with this subject

* it is self-contained and concise
* it isn't just a collection of formulas
* it explains *how* to compute differentials and derivatives
* it covers some of the theory needed to really understand things

Please let me know if there are points in the text which need some clarification

Hi r/math

Alright, I am not a full blown mathematician, but versed enough to be dangerous. 

That being said, etc), I usually draw myself a nice 2-D example, and work from there. If I 'get it' in 2D, I can then verify that I also get it in 3D. If I get it in 3D, then I can easily be content that my visualization/intuition that has taken me this far, applies that same way in hyperdimensional N-D

This has served me very very well for very long. In fact

I am currently taking an optimization course that has led me to new concepts in N-D, and once again, what I 'get' in 2D/3D, I easily get in ND.

Anyway it was just an interesting thought problem that popped into my head the other day. What I mean by ""explicitly referred to"" is either spoken out loud, but I wouldn't count those because it's not people using them specifically. ID numbers that are directly used by people *do* count though -- phone numbers and UPCs for example.

I know the US uses 10 digit phone numbers, written or typed at some point by somebody. (That seems reasonable to assume to me, but I welcome thoughts. That is 9 billion unique numbers, but even the ones that have never been assigned to any phone line may have been misdialed, misspoken, or used as an estimate for world population at some point).

I do think it's safe to assume that all numbers up to some certain point have simply been spoken out loud before. Certainly every number up to a million, 9-, 10- and 11- digit numbers. UPCs are 12 digits, but I don't think that necessarily covers all 12 digit numbers. In fact I'm sure UPCs alone, even with all previous mistakes and typos writing them out, do not cover all 12 digit numbers. Are there other common uses of 12 digit numbers that might make the order of magnitude of the smallest yet-unused number higher? For now, that's my guess,,False,t3_199vpt

**A letter to the mathematics community.**

We are writing to let you know of a series of changes that we are making to how the Elsevier mathematics program will be run. Some of these are new initiatives

We have been listening actively to the community and we see a number of issues that we need to address

Pricing
Mathematics journals published by Elsevier tend to be larger than those of other publishers. On a price-per-article, but not always, lower than those of other mathematics publishers.

Our target is for all of our core mathematics titles to be priced at or below US$11 per article (equivalent to 50-60 cents per normal typeset page) by next year, we will lower our prices, as we already have in recent years for journals such as the Journal of Algebra and Topology and its Applications, among others.

We realize that this is just part of the concerns about pricing -and we will seek to address concerns about the nature and composition of the large discounted agreements

Access and Open Archives
To make clear that we are committed to wider access, back to 1995, the year when we started publishing digitally. All current and future papers featured in these journals will become free to read, for subscribers and non subscribers alike. This initiative is part of a number of open access publishing options we have available which give researchers the freedom to choose to open their research beyond the academic community. For more information about Elsevier's open access options, visit [www.elsevier.com/openaccess](http://mail.elsevier-alerts.com/go.asp?/bESJ001/mHDM9Z4F/qQDVIZ4F/uQ1WQC2F/x4Q3CZ4F).

We are a founding partner in [Research4Life](http://mail.elsevier-alerts.com/go.asp?/bESJ001/mHDM9Z4F/q84M0Z4F/uQ1WQC2F/x4Q3CZ4F), are available in more than 100 developing countries.

Our position on RWA
Elsevier has announced today that we are withdrawing our support for the Research Works Act. In recent weeks

Moving forward
Now that we have explained the steps we have taken so far we want to stress this is just the beginning.

We will create a scientific council for mathematics

There are many other issues where we wish to engage with the community

We welcome your views on these and all our efforts at: mathematics@elsevier.com

    Show that

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{4n+1}} &lt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \

    Can you improve this approximation?

If you'd like to do this problem yourself

Now

In these plots I change where we are on the n-axis a bunch so don't be alarmed.

* [(4\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/c2GDu.png) - This is the lower bound from the original problem.  Let's see if we can narrow that gap.

* [(3.5\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/Lsvtl.png) - Hey that's a little better.  Can we go further?

* [(3.1\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/4ddM4.png) - Oh

* [(3.2\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/EXDnj.png) - Hmm

* [(Pi\*n + 1)^-1/2 ](http://i.imgur.com/1E2VL.png) - Now I'm on to something.  Whenever you see Pi you know it wasn't an accident.

So, I just couldn't seem to get the result to fall out, and I had a gut feeling that a proof of this new lower bound would require some heavy machinery.  It was at this point that I posted the question to r/cheatatmathhomework in the hopes that someone would have something applicable in their toolbox.  Liberalkid suggested using Stirling's approximation, which I think has the potential to reveal a bound of a different form, but I'm too tired to try to work through it tonight--maybe someone else would like to have a go?

After posting I turned to google to see if I could find anything useful

In 1956

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + \pi/2}} &lt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \, ;]

which is slightly worse than my guess of (Pi\*n + 1)^-1/2 .  His proof also revealed where the Pi comes from: [Wallis' formula](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/WallisFormula.html).  This bound was sharpened to less-than-*or-equal-to* by G. N. Watson in 1959.  In 1985

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + \pi (n+1)/(4n+3)}} &lt; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \

The next year

        [; \frac{1}{\sqrt{\pi n + 4 - \pi}} \leq \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \

was found by Chao-Ping Chen in 2006 ([PDF of paper](http://math-res-pub.org/content/cma/abstr111.pdf) and [Google reader link](http://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:ksgDTDNUklgJ:math-res-pub.org/content/cma/abstr111.pdf))

It is interesting to note that there is an upper bound for the expression

        [; \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{3}{4} \cdot \frac{5}{6} \cdot \

So

But that embarassment aside, I opened a browser to go online and look up the answer, but  stopped myself and decided to figure it out instead.

The thing is that it took me 3-5 minutes to come up with an answer.  Isn't that funny?  I was apprehensive and even scared to solve something for the majority of my adult life; something that when I actually attempted it took me no more than 5 minutes.  There's a lesson in that...somewhere

Without further ado

sqrt(x)

1. Factor out a known square root (4, 324, 10,000, etc), called F1 such that: sqrt(x) = sqrt(F1) * sqrt (x/F1)

2. Repeat process with sqrt (x/F1)  until satsified with precision (generally this needs to be done 3 or 4 times to get a minimal level of precision).

**warning

Perhaps an example would help

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (1354/400)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.385)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.24) x sqrt (3.385/3.24)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.24) x sqrt (1.0448)

= sqrt (400) x sqrt (3.24) x sqrt (1.0404) x sqrt (1.0448/1.0404)

Well you get the idea

= 20 x 1.8 x 1.02 = 36.72

Using a calculator sqrt (1354) = 36.7967...

Not bad

In conclusion: yes I know it is nothing earth shattering, never learned how to take square roots (unlikely), but here you go!!

    2 X 2 = Three more than one
    3 X 3 = Five more than four

    1^2 = 1
    2^2 = 1 + 3

    n^2 = 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 3) + (2n - 1)

Then

After screwing around with the algorithm for a while, I decided to try jumping a quarter of the way towards the vertex instead of halfway. Some ugly images ensued. I tried some other ratios, 3/5th, each one slightly shading the point it lands on a little lighter. The image took around 45 minutes to generate

I am a Mathematics professor at a liberal arts university looking to improve my lectures.  I think that I tend to do a fairly good job of explaining concepts, but not of them are very satisfying to me.  So, I decided to turn to Reddit.  I am teaching Calc II this semester, so I wanted to start with the question of why someone needs to learn integration techniques (such as integration by parts, partial fraction decomposition, and trig substitution).

I know several engineers and computer scientists

So Reddit

**Additional Information**

The majors of my calc students are as follows:

* Around 1/3 are Chemistry or Biology majors.
* The rest are a mix of Pre-Engineering, and Math majors.
* The Math majors are mostly going into secondary education.  There are a few that focus on actuarial science.  Very few are interested in grad school in math.

**My Standard Answers**
&gt; You will need it in your (Engineering/Chemistry/Whatever) classes.

This is probably true

&gt; If you are a future teacher

Okay

&gt; Even if computers can do this sort of work

I agree with this

&gt; Passing a Calc class shows future employers that you are intelligent.

If you're unfamiliar with it

Let f(n) be the number of prime numbers less than or equal to n.

Let g(n)=f(n)/n 

Let ln(n) be the natural logarithm of n.

.

The theorem states that the limit of g(n)*ln(n) is 1. (or g(n) ~ 1/ln(n) ).

Visualizing it or checking necessity of hypotheses to develop intuition?  Applying it to examples?  If I've learned and memorized a lot of group theory results

Also, likely statements for example.  Or to get a good grasp on a horribly disorganized new field.

So

1) **What exactly are the skills you need to be a successful research mathematician?** (I'm more interested in the non-administrative points here.)  I would guess we could eventually form a nice list of basics to advanced skills, hockey, you need to practice skating, then stick handling, basic puck handling and passing, shooting &amp; positioning, then more complicated play formation, then more extravagant skills.  In math you need to have basic mental focus

2) **How do you train those skills in a focused way?**  In sports, you shoot at the corners of the net, you practice drop shots, etc.  We have well defined tasks and clear reasons for them.  It's not as clear for me with math.


Note: I'm not asking for a shortcut to become an awesome mathematician.  I'm trying to figure out efficient ways to go practice hours a day for several years and become an awesome mathematician.  Both for myself, or some of the advanced ones are known skills but it's not clear how to practice them effectively.

**Edit**: Some people have asked what kind of math I'm interested in or what my background is.  To give some more context to see where I'm coming from: I'm already engaged in research, for sure, that's a given.  But it seems like I picked up some non-clearly-defined skills along the way that sum up to an ability to do research currently.  I don't know targeted ways to train those skills, and I'm not totally sure what they all are.  I'd like to figure that out, because it will certainly benefit me and others.  So, I'm seeking to identify particular skills and generate ideas for ways to train them in order to more efficiently progress in mathematical ability.

**Important side note** The current top rated response is in direct opposition to the spirit of this question.   The relevant answers have been the ones providing ideas like trying to generate counterexamples to theorems with some hypotheses removed to try to train intuition for the role of different properties,,False,,t5_2qh0n,1356215108.0,,True

1300376658.0,g5vsp,Bayesian Approaches to Uncertainty: The Case of Reddit Comments,wren5x,163,33,54,"Currently Reddit comments are sorted by ""best"" by default. What this means is that they are sorted in order by the lower-bound of the 95% confidence interval over the percent of votes that are upvotes (I will explain what that means in plain English in a moment). You can read details [here](http://blog.reddit.com/2009/10/reddits-new-comment-sorting-system.html). 

This is basically a way of dealing with uncertainty. If a comment only has 2 upvotes and 1 downvote, how well it will play to the Reddit audience). However, there is some probabilistic information there. If the comment is really bad and would eventually be downvoted by 99% of Redditors, then the current data are somewhat unlikely. They are much more likely under the assumption that 2/3rds of voting Redditors will upvote it. 

The current approach asks the question

What I want to point out is that there are actually a multitude of ways that this uncertainty could be dealt with. You can form a probability distribution over the percent of votes that are upvotes using a [beta distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_distribution). So if you assume that all percentages are equally likely before we see the data

If you go to Wolfram Alpha,101). Same ratio, but much more information. As such, there is less uncertainty and a very narrow distribution. Cool, huh? 

The bottom-bound of the 95% confidence interval is the current way to summarize this distribution. Basically, a median, a maximum (mode), an upper-bound on the 95% CI (confidence interval), a lower-bound on a 90% CI, on and on. It's impossible to find a theoretically best summary because anything will lose information in some way. 

You could even just *sample* from these distributions. That is, but comments with little information will fly around more. This would mean some people seeing bad comments at the top sometimes, but would decrease the bias towards newer comments (even further). It would also mean that two comments in a dead heat are going to be seen in both orders (comment A on top, and comment B on top) by about half of Reddit. This makes sense in a certain way; if we're not sure, then why not just hedge a little? 

The other big thing that we could do is use prior information. We know before a comment is submitted that it is unlikely to either be a rockstar nor an obvious troll. Note that I said *unlikely*

I think a reasonable prior would be a Beta(3, then the Beta over its percentage of upvotes is Beta(7,4). 

This is an interesting situation because there are a *huge* number of comments already in the database

Of course this isn't going to be perfect but there's just no helping that. Dealing with uncertainty necessarily means that we are going to get it wrong sometimes. 

So hopefully I've piqued your interest in this kind of approach. I thought r/math/ might enjoy thinking about these ideas. If you want to read more

Over the past couple months I've been giving a lecture series on topology at my school

I feel like

Of course I'm not only talking about extended series of lectures, it would probably be a perfect topic for a lecture.

Some topic ideas I had recently

* Infinite surds.  I definitely suggest working the problem out on your own if you haven't seen it before because it's pretty neat.  I think this would be a perfect first practice lecture.  Essentially, \,\, a_3 = \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a + \sqrt{a}}}, ;]` and so on and so forth.  The question is, does (or when does) this sequence converge?  What if we use cube roots?  Fourth roots?  What if we let *a* be complex?  Bonus points for this last one if you make pretty graphs in mathematica/sage/matlab to show for what starting values in the complex plane the sequence will converge.  Actually I don't know if you'll get interesting pictures here, I've never tried it.

* Building off of the last one, and Julia sets (and how they're related) are all pretty standard but it would probably be more interesting to talk about less popular fractals and the algorithms which generate them, along with any unique properties.  Bonus points for writing actual code to draw them (C, python, etc.)  Higher level lectures might talk about the dimension or connectedness of a fractal.

* Recurrence relations and generating functions.  There is an amazing free book on this called [generatingfunctionology](http://www.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/DownldGF.html) which I highly recommend.  The background required is just single variable calculus!  I plan to give a presentation or two on this eventually

* Continued fractions.  The books I've read on this topic tend to be a little terse and I've wanted to see if I could make the concepts a little more intuitive and the material a little more fluid.  A one-off talk on this topic might begin with their standard form, and the representations of pi.  Talks might also focus on the more esoteric [Khinchin's constant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khinchin's_constant), or the application of continued fractions to [Pell's equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pell's_equation).  Of course I have to recommend Khinchin's book on the subject; there's a Dover edition which sells for under $10.

* While we're at it

* Graph theory.  Planarity, there's just SO MUCH HERE that doesn't require much background.  Just draw some dots, draw some lines connecting them, and run with it.

* Orthogonal polynomials.  There's a lot of freedom here; pick a single class (e.g. the Laguerre polynomials) and dive deep.  Or, huh?  There are essentially only 6 families of orthogonal polynomials originating from differential equations.  There are a bunch of interesting results on general orthogonal polynomials as well (the recurrence relation, interlacing of roots, etc. I feel like I would want to cover a proof of one of these.)

* I recently came across this paper by David Gleich called ""Finite calculus: a tutorial for solving nasty sums"", really want to do this one.  Handy methods for solving tricky sums?  I'm so down.

* I gave a talk not too long ago on Euler's proof of a special case of Fermat's Last Theorem (when the exponent is 3).  There is tons of information on this online

* Set theory.  Cardinals and ordinals are always interesting.  The relationship between and importance of Zorn's lemma, and could lead into independence and incompleteness.  Timothy Chow's paper [A beginner's guide to forcing](http://www-math.mit.edu/~tchow/cv.html) might serve well as a basis for a more advanced lecture.

* Discrete convexity and optimality.  There has been a lot of work in discrete optimization in the past half century and there is so much interesting information out there.  A talk might bring up various problems and explain how the methods of the field can be applied.  Or

* Got any puzzles you've solved?  Any competition problems you find interesting?  Talk about your approaches

* Physics stuff.  Applied math stuff.  Simulations.  Simulations are an especially good topic because usually you can show pretty pictures and talk about the math in a hand-wavy manner

That's all I can think of for now.  Hell I'm not even sure what's good from that list

Remember that your main goal is to make the material accessible to your peers.  Don't just write a bunch of calculations on the board, do talk about the background of the problem, and do your best to communicate all the intuition you can.  Even if they don't remember the content of the lecture when they walk out the door, the intuition will remain, and that's more important.

Probably the best thing about all this is that teaching something is, you want to be able to at least start an answer for them, and perhaps point them toward where they might find the solution.

Well, I'll leave you with three things to keep in mind when speaking:

1. Be passionate.

2. Don't rush.

3. Don't talk to the board the entire time.",,t5_2qh0n,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/eh9f7/math_undergraduates_doing_this_will_improve_your/

e.g. 129 becomes 1^2 + 2^2 + 9^2 = 86.
86 becomes 8^2 + 6^2 = 100.
100 becomes 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1.
So 129 is a happy number.

An open question is what percentage of all numbers are happy numbers.  Thus far, 219, 291, 912, and 921.  Likewise, so is any variation that only inserts zeros, such as 1029, etc.  With 122 digits,986

But

1) If 86 is a happy number, 555311, and 66321 are happy numbers, because their happy sums are all 86.

2) Appending a single digit to an number increases its happy sum by the square of that digit.

With these

H(N
H(N

We seed the count with H(0

In the first iteration we get
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1
H(1

For N digits,X) takes only 10 operations - collecting and summing the 10 values for H(N-1,X-i^2).  With the counts known, the final operation is to add all the counts where X is a happy number.

With this approach,810,986,000 to 6,077,430.  Generally, this approach counts the number of happy numbers at N digits in O(Log(N)^2)

I have used this approach to calculate the number (and percentage) of happy numbers up to 6, will take this approach and extend the calculations much, much farther.

The interesting thing is that the percentage of happy numbers doesn't seem to converge.  It oscillates between the extremes of 11.38% and 18.58%. The rate of oscillation seems to decrease as the digits increase
