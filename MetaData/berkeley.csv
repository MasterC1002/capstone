&gt;We have received disturbing reports of observed cheating on the final --- people copying answers and continuing past when time was called.

&gt;**If you yourself cheated, to have your name and reputation ruined for all time. (Think about what the Google Pagerank is of my website and of the EECS website. Remember, in the USA, it isn't libel or slander if I have evidence. Simply the fact that it hurts your reputation doesn't make it legally objectionable if it is true. And I'm a tenured faculty member.)**

&gt;For those of you who saw something, b. where roughly you were in the room, c. where the cheaters were.

&gt;If you know or suspect who the cheaters were (or can provide a description)

&gt;It is really important in this case because we are trying to be fair to everyone in adjusting the grading to compensate for the unfortunate and unforeseen loss of 15 minutes. The cheaters are going to be hurting the grades of all the honest students in the class. They deserve no mercy or loyalty after doing such a despicable act to their fellow students. Please think of the good of all of the other students in the class and help us quickly find and isolate them from the sample.

&gt;We have tried our best to make a fair exam with a chance for students at all levels of ability to demonstrate their understanding, we released a specially made exam skeleton to reduce any uncertainty about the format, we allowed students to bring 3 handwritten sheets of paper, and we offered ample extra credit opportunities in the class. **We created and staffed homework parties and study parties to help students both interact with each other and get attention in what would otherwise be a large and impersonal class. To have students cheat in this context is extremely upsetting to me. To do so brazenly, in view of their peers, is a shameless act that is simply shocking. I have never seen such a thing in one of my own classes in my years at Berkeley.**

&gt;For those who saw something

And later:

&gt;UPDATE: Our estimates show that the extent of the truly egregious cheating seems to have been quite limited --- less than 2% of the class. We have had confessions and detailed reporting that has helped us in the process of identifying perpetrators. Those guilty really should confess if they know what is good for them. **As Brian Harvey has eloquently put it, especially your youth when your character is most malleable. The violence cheating does to your intuitions of right and wrong is a terrible thing.** It is not too late. If you come forward without prompting, it'll be like stealing something that was in a sealed package and returning it without it being either opened or missed. We will be lenient and your character (and grades) will benefit greatly.

&gt;For those of you who know something

*It still feels weird to type

*I’m not sure what I’ve learned in my time here

*What follows is not intended to be the be all, this column is going to consist of some reflections on my experience these last four years, categorized into some loose pieces of advice for readers at large.*

*Welcome to what has been my life. Hopefully it’s useful.*

*Pretty much nothing will go according to plan. That is okay. I started here aiming to finish my English degree in three years, the kind of plan I’m sure many of you have right now. But the time table changed – and so did I. Come May 18th, I’ll still be graduating with a B.A. in English, but it will be in my fourth year, not the original three I had sketched out. Accompanying it will be minors in Education, Asian American Studies, and I fell one class short of my third minor in Creative Writing.*

*None of these things were on the schedule – they were interests that developed or were furthered during my years here. In the case of Asian American Studies, why not? What followed was one of the most intellectually rewarding experiences of my college career, one which I wasn’t prepared for but went with anyway.*

*Don’t keep your self strictly on a track, whether it’s a class, a DeCal, or just an extracurricular. College is not about remaining where you are comfortable – it is about testing yourself and growing in ways you never thought were possible.*

*For the love of God, ever hurts to pay your instructors a visit. More on that here, though [[flip to page 24-25](http://issuu.com/calibermag/docs/issue6?mode=window&amp;backgroundColor=%23222222)].*

*Nap. This one speaks for itself. You are not superheroes or cyborgs. You will need sleep

*Almost everybody thinks they aren’t smart enough to be here, you should be working even harder to prove that you belong, not falling apart because of it.*

*In truth, which means it no longer matters if you think you’re smart enough or not. You are a Berkeley student – a title that exists because you’ve been accepted here; perceived intelligence be damned – and nobody is going to take that away from you unless you want it to be taken away from you.*

*Learn how you learn best, tweaking and modifying it until you’re happy with who you are as a student. Do this beginning from your first day on campus, because who you are as a student and how you learn best are always changing. I only found out last month that I work best when tape recording lectures to listen back to at my own pace, since I have a hard time sitting still.*

*[You would also be surprised how many people have no idea how they learn.]*

*There isn’t one way to do college. Do you. Four years here, never woken up with some girl I didn’t recognize, never done any drugs, or any one of a billion things that make up the quintessential  “college experience”. Do I wish I had done a few things differently? Sure, who doesn’t? But do I think that that means my college experience was invalidated because I would’ve failed any Berkeley Bucket List? Hell no. I grew as a person, a student, and a future educator – and I’m happy with who I became here

*Growth doesn’t happen the same way for everyone. Don’t fool yourself into thinking there are things you “have” to do to get the most out of college – the only thing that matters is that you’re taking steps to being who you want to be.*

*Berkeley is amazing. Make it last. This place isn’t going to be a good fit for everybody, it’s been everything I hoped it would be. Give it a chance. All this goes without saying, but do take advantage of what it has to offer – all of its eccentricities and imperfections, its world class classes and its spectacular sights. You won’t regret it.*",,False,self,False,t3_1dkrei

I guess if anyone is wondering how to find the meetup when it happens I'm a guy with blue/greenish and red streaks in my hair and I recently fractured my fibula so I'll also be on/have crutches. 

This is a repost/reminder for those interested. 

**When**: Sunday

**Where**: Memorial Glade

**What**: Potluck

**Why**: ????

**Who**: UC Berkeley redditors

Sunday, according to the results of [this poll](http://www.doodle.com/28v47r8a9cyq4q8r#table). As for the time, let's set it up for the afternoon, perhaps 2 - 4 PM.

**Edit#2**: A lot of people seemed to like the idea of a potluck on Memorial Glade. Unless too many people object to that idea, plates, cups, forks/spoons, towels/blankets if you don't want to sit directly on the grass, entertainment stuff, etc...). To make it so that people don't buy too much of the same thing

**Edit#3**: This probably has been a bit of a potential issue for a while, feel free to invite your friends/spread the word (although I guess you don't need me to tell you to do that). In hindsight, it probably would've been better to make this on a facebook page as someone had suggested, but meh, I wasn't necessarily going in with the intention of doing all this &gt;.&gt;. Although, I guess I could always just make one now...

**Edit#4**: There's still a week + before our established date. The established time so far is 2 - 4 pm (ppl are free to organize their own little after meetup/party, as stated above there's still plenty of time to set up a different meetup time that will suit the most people. Anyways, continue sending me PM's (private messages) with whatever you can/want to contribute to the potluck. The idea is that we can spread the costs around a bit, so not one person or a few people has to bring everything.

Food: Karojo (chips

Drinks: Vkmita (maybe? need confirmation)

**FACEBOOK EVENT FOR VIEWING PARTY: https://www.facebook.com/events/280751332031859/**

Traditionally the Collegiate Starleague has been centered in North America with its events

**The Korean Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has challenged one of the CSLs top schools, and confirmed to be a team that practices with top Korean team MVP, KAIST is a strong challenger. Yet UC Berkeley is no small threat either. Winners of the very first CSL Season and consistent top finishers in subsequent seasons, UC Berkeley has been one of the CSLs finest representatives. Led by team ace CheckSixSuppy, the top placing American player and MLG Breakout Player of MLG Anaheim, UC Berkeley will look to defend its honor, and the honor of the CSL

----

**THE EVENT: UC Berkeley vs KAIST in a best of 9 showmatch**
 
**THE FORMAT: GSTL all-kill format using the GSTL Season 2 mappool**

**THE STREAM: [twitch.tv/cstarleague](http://www.twitch.tv/cstarleague) starting at 3:00 pm PST**

So my GPA *tanked* this semester. It's been my dream to go to graduate school

But that's not what this post is mainly about. I guess the real problem here is just... I have no one to talk to about it (maybe this is obvious since I'm here annoying you guys instead of keeping my business off reddit and to myself). I feel like no one really understands me

I do have friends from before coming to Berkeley. However, and this loneliness is most bitterly experienced in times of extreme self-doubt, times of utter destruction of any faith in my own aptitude. Sometimes, I think, just having someone else there for validation would work wonders for my emaciated confidence.

1371679757.0,1gopan,Hungry Homeless Berkeley Students,maxdougherty,53,10,23,"	Berkeley has a long history of supporting its large urban homeless 
community. Through donations and food drives
their time and money to provide shelter and necessities of life. But this often 
skips the largely under-recognized community of homeless students on our 
own campus. These are students who live out of their cars or in the library. 
Those who use the RSF to shower or ""couch surf"" moving around nightly among
acquaintances. They are students engaging in a full course load on top of 
worrying about where they are going to spend the night and find a reliable 
meal. Many of these students are too ashamed to ask for real help or just don't
know how to. Most of us, but 
we can make a difference and there are some institutions in place that try to 
help. 
	Programs like ""Meal Points for the Homeless"" allow you to buy food at 
the GBC and then hand it to student volunteers who take the donations to a 
homeless shelter. But unless willing to seek help at a shelter
excludes the homeless student population. Instead I propose a point donation 
system. If we had the ability to donate our remaining meal points to a pool to 
distribute among these students rather than turn them into a nearly literal pool 
full of reese's cups or other non-essentials that most students quickly buy at 
the end of the semester to spend their remaining points
difference in the lives of our fellow students.
	Of course there are a number of questions to answer and any real 
program would have to be thoroughly developed
university-wide discussion. Maybe we could really make a positive impact on 
the lives of many of our fellow students. This Berkeley community is a family 
and has traditionally stood up for those in need. Why not include our own 
student population! Let me know what you think and whether you want to join 
the effort to make a difference.

The Collegiate Star League (CSL) and UC Berkeley would like you to come out this weekend to learn about the CSL and eSports events in general. With that in mind we'd like to present THE BIG MATCH, as part of the CSL’s regular season. Cal, currently 12-2 on the season and 2nd in the division, is looking to finish the last stretch of the regular season on a strong note after suffering their second defeat of the season to UC Irvine’s squad last week. Led by ace player CheckSix Suppy, and with a strong squad behind him, Cal is looking to get into prime form and solidify their place in the division as the playoffs draw near. Stanford, currently 9-5 on the season, and they will have a sense of urgency to win as a result.

The breakdown: http://img853.imageshack.us/img853/6118/bigmatchfinal.png

What: THE BIG MATCH - Cal vs Stanford

When: Saturday

Where: Room 3 Evans Hall http://berkeley.edu/map/maps/BC45.html

Event: The matches will be brought to you live via stream with commentary using the projector in the lecture hall. Attendance is free

Format: The Collegiate Star League uses a best of 5 format for the regular season, with the ace player by each team during the match if it reaches the 5th set. The order of sets goes:

Set 1: xSixSuppy **&lt;GSL Daybreak&gt; ioRemarK&gt;** ioRemarK

Set 2: IMtwentyoneJ **&lt;MLG Xel'naga Caverns&gt;** SituatioN

Set 3 : PikA and Lozzle **&lt;Scorched Haven&gt;** Rubix and RageofTiamat

Set 4: bnYFan **&lt;MLG Antiga Shipyard&gt;** excal

Closer: ACE **&lt;Tal'darim Altar LE&gt;** ACE

Team pages:

Cal – http://www.cstarleague.com/league/teams/76

Stanford – http://www.cstarleague.com/league/teams/67

This should be an exciting matchup to watch with the end of the regular season approaching and regional playoffs looming! Both teams have a lot of stake as they head down the stretch

We are working on our first game called picmypic. We were chosen to present at the EA headquarters in front of the EA CEO. He loved the idea and offered us free access to his facilities and free consulting from his top game devs for no obligation. My co-founder and I are going to the EA headquarters next week after spring break to work with some game developers.

We are looking for more Objective C programmers to help us create this game. We plan to have a beta out by the end of August.

Edit#2:  A lot of people seemed to like the idea of a potluck on Memorial Glade. Unless too many people object to that idea, plates, cups, forks/spoons, towels/blankets if you don't want to sit directly on the grass, entertainment stuff, etc...). To make it so that people don't buy too much of the same thing

Edit#3: This probably has been a bit of a potential issue for a while, feel free to invite your friends/spread the word (although I guess you don't need me to tell you to do that). In hindsight, it probably would've been better to make this on a facebook page as someone had suggested, but meh, I wasn't necessarily going in with the intention of doing all this &gt;.&gt;. Although, I guess I could always just make one now...

Edit#4: There's still a week + before our established date. The established time so far is 2 - 4 pm (ppl are free to organize their own little after meetup/party, as stated above there's still plenty of time to set up a different meetup time that will suit the most people. Anyways, continue sending me PM's (private messages) with whatever you can/want to contribute to the potluck. The idea is that we can spread the costs around a bit, so not one person or a few people has to bring everything.

**Why am I not accepted to the fall semester?** Nobody knows for sure. Some people have ideas and theories about it being totally random, still go to classes that count for your grad. requirements, and will have the same expierence as regular admits.

**Are the classes harder/easier?** It's a bit subjective since most people don't take the same courses on FPF as they do on campus. I'd say it mostly depends on your instructor. In general, our FPF classes were a lot easier than our classes on campus. We always joke about first semester being easier, but that wasn't such a bad thing. haha 

**What are the downsides of FPF?** The class selection is terrible. Virtually 0 interesting classes

Almost everyone I knew was in what I call ""FPF Denial."" Which is a case where FPF kids were in denial that there was anything wrong with FPF. I suspect it stems from bitterness from not being on campus first semester. Common bullshit you'll hear:

* It's a great transition
* The classes are just as challenging/rewarding
* There's no difference between classes on campus and at FPF

These are all kind of half-true. Personally

That said: **DO FPF!!!** I know i kind of just blasted FPF, you'll already be familiar with the campus and you'll appreciat the class choice even more. Good luck to all! ",,False,self,t5_2qh9w,False,,

Due to fee hikes, most students will accrue debt as they attend school, as a result, we all have already been bitten and infected. With little prospects of stable employment after graduation

If you wish to participate come meet up at Sather Gate at 11:30 PM. All you need to do is dress as a zombie! You can create your own getup at home or we will have some makeup to provide at the gate. If you don't or can't get dressed up as a zombie well then you can be one of the unlucky students who get to be chased around by the zombie debt mob!

**Why bother participating?** Well for one it'll be fun. Number two, there's also some links on the facebook event page for more info. 

**Is this one action going to solve all of our problems?** No

**Edit: What is the metaphor of the zombie?** Well what do zombies do? They chase people. For how long? Until they're dead or those being chased are dead. The same concept goes with student debt, or they will pretty much consume you. You can cut off an arm or a leg and throw it to the zombies to satiate their hunger for a little bit, but after that they'll still hunt you down. With debtors they will chase people down until the very last cent. 

Anyways

Oh yeah,"" so uhh yeah, let's hope so!

Honestly, and essays I think are crap. I've made friends with my floor mates and other people, I have friends in classes, I go out, but when it gets to the studying I just feel so overwhelmed all the time, and everyone around me seems so prepared and they just know so much stuff.
Also, and it's just so stressful. I don't know what to do. I just want to go home. I know this should past, but I just hate it so much right now.

tl;dr: I'm not smart enough for college.

**EDIT:** Thanks so much for the feedback. I have a couple more concerns/questions.

**Waitlists:** Everyone always complains that it's impossible to get the classes you need at Berkeley. Is this true for EECS majors? How commonly are you put on the waitlist for a class/how easy is it to get off the waitlist?

**Stress:** Everyone knows both schools are stressful

**Extracurriculars:** What are some common extracurricular activities for EECS majors?

**Entrepreneurial Spirit:** Everyone knows Stanford has this entrepreneurial spirit










**Original:**
Here are a couple of key comparisons between the two schools that I have noticed:

**Class size:** Class size at Caltech is obviously smaller than Berkeley (35 CS majors vs. 300 EECS majors). Some lower div CS classes at Berkeley get as big as 200 students.

**Classes offered:** Caltech only has about 14 CS professors, according to both students and professors.

**AP credits:** Caltech does not accept AP credits

**Core requirements:** Caltech's core is notorious for its rigor and difficulty (proof-based calculus anyone?) but makes me a better problem-solver and thinker (something interviewers like to see).

**Semester vs. quarter system:** Berkeley is on a 15 week semester system, but at Caltech, I would have to take 5 classes a quarter.

**Cost:** Berkeley is a lot cheaper than Caltech because I would pay in-state tuition (~$30

**Scholarships:** Berkeley is offering me the Regents' Scholarship of $2500 per year. This guarantees me housing for four years, and the ability to join the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholars Association (which hosts faculty dinners, alumni dinners, etc.) I don't know if this would give me a significant leg up over other EECS students in terms of getting letters of recommendation, finding research, etc.

**Housing:** Housing is not a problem at Caltech. At Berkeley

**Research:** About 70% of Caltech undergrads do research, I feel like at Berkeley, I would be competing with other EECS students for research opportunities. Caltech is conveniently situated near JPL, and Berkeley is situated near LBNL.

**Internships/Jobs:** Everyone at Caltech says that a Caltech degree opens a lot of doors for you, these Berkeley grads seem to be doing fine (https://career.berkeley.edu/Major/EECS.stm), and Berkeley is conveniently located in the Bay Area (I'm from the Bay). Berkeley has a larger alumni network because of its larger size and because Caltech students are more academically inclined (more pursue academic careers versus professional careers).

**Environment:** Berkeley is known for being cut-throat. Caltech seems very friendly and welcoming (more cooperative than competitive).

**GPA:** The average GPA for Berkeley EECS is about 2.7 to 2.9. At Caltech

**Double major:** At Berkeley, Economics, and Management (BEM).

**Master's:** Berkeley has a 5 year's master's program for highly qualified EECS students (roughly 10 to 15 EECS students).

**Rankings:** US News &amp; World Report ranks Berkeley higher than Caltech for both computer engineering and EE (#4 and #3 vs. #8 and #7). Among people I've talked to in the Bay,False,self,t5_2qh9w,True,,,t3_sn9lg

2. Put them on your music player and show up at 6pm on the Upper Sproul steps on Thursday at 6pm with your headphones and music player.

&gt;Just wanted to check in and let you all know that we've assembled a meetup themed prize pack with custom stickers and other assorted stuff. Can you let me know where we should deliver it? (I'll warn you when it's sent out). Also we're thinking of doing the frontpage logo and style changes at the end of January in a sort of reddit college bowl week thing

It has been decided that the package will be sent to me. I will not open the package until we actually distribute the prizes.

The next thing that we as a community need to decide is when and where we will distribute them. I think it would be the most logical to have a meetup probably somewhere on campus sometime at the beginning of the next school semester. The 28th of January seems like a decent date. It's a Saturday that's on the second weekend after school starts. In my opinion the first week is always too hectic.

I returned to Berkeley yesterday after a week-long trip to Seoul
  
While away, about the Occupy Cal activities on campus.  However, it was only yesterday that I was able to look at a number of the videos that were made of the protests on November 9.  These videos are very disturbing.  The events of last Wednesday are unworthy of us as a university community.  Sadly, they point to the dilemma that we face in trying to prevent encampments and thereby mitigate long-term risks to the health and safety of our entire community.
   
Most certainly, and current Chair of the Police Review Board (PRB) to launch immediately a review of the police actions of last Wednesday and Thursday morning.  As is normal process, University Police Chief Mitch Celaya is concurrently undertaking an operational review of last week's events.  He has requested that it be conducted by a senior member of the command staff at one of our sister UC campuses.  This report will be provided to the PRB.  I am confident that Professor Choper will provide a fair and balanced judgment as speedily as possible. 

We believe that we can best move forward by granting amnesty from action under the Student Code of Conduct to all Berkeley students who were arrested and cited solely for attempting to block the police in removing the Occupy Cal encampment on Wednesday

I believe that as a campus community, finding a way to reverse Prop. 209, and instituting reforms that will help California regain its status as the door to the American Dream through public higher education.  Thanks to the efforts of our students who worked effectively with Assemblyman Cedillo, myself and other members of our campus community, we were able to ensure that the legislature in Sacramento passed AB 130 and AB 131 which Gov. Brown ultimately signed.  This example of successful and peaceful activism with students and campus leaders working together can guide us in how we can collaborate to effect real change that will benefit us all.  We share the aspirations of the Occupy movement for a better America.  I am confident that as a campus community we will find a peaceful and productive way forward.
