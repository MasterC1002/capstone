Where are my company's products being sold? Which products are being sold the most in any given region/state?

What is the frequency of sales for competing OTC products made by other companies? (By region if possible)

I am attempting to draw conclusions in order to design a product launch schedule/plan for the company at which I am currently employed. 

Any and all help is greatly appreciated. Please offer additional suggestions if you think I am asking the wrong questions with respect to my stated goal.

Thanks again!
Sincerely
docious

Reason for the data? Countries have borders. But the internet is an international phenomenon. The main borders are language borders

Here are some of my criteria:

- Nothing from an R package
- Not really anything finance
- A description of how the data was collected
- At least around 200 data points

Here are some of the things I would ideally like/or am interested in:

- Public health questions (surveillance
- Perhaps data from California
- Computational biology (unfortunately these are usually short time series)

If it helps, spectral analysis, etc.)
