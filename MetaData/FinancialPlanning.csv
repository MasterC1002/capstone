I graduated college in May 2012 and have been working in a limited-term employment position for a non-profit since August making just enough to scrape by in the city I live in on a very strict budget. My limited-term employment ends June 28th

My credit score is ""excellent"". I currently have approximately $18, but only use one, and the limit on the card I use is $500). Those are the only debts I have. I currently have about $500 in savings - I have currently been using my savings (which came from my grandfather's life insurance policy payout he specifically gave me to pay student loans off) to pay the $200 minimum payment each month.

I know that I will be using part of my $2000 bonus at the end of my term with my current job to pay off the rest of my credit card and bring the balance to $0, since I am usually unable to in my current situation and would like to do something nice for him (these obligations total $1200). The rest after taxes will either go into savings or towards my student loans. What I need your advice on is:
 
* What I should do with my extra money - both the remainder of this bonus, not my savings) my student loans at $200-$300 per month and put $400-600 a month (these numbers may fluctuate depending on emergencies or ""surprises"" I need to buy) into savings until I have two months of ""take-home pay"" saved up. After I have two full months saved, I want to switch the amounts I am paying to loans/putting in savings. According to my calculations, I should have two full months saved in 9-10 months. If I switch what I'm paying heavily on after this, my loans should be paid off in less than 4 years. I am also considering opening a separate savings account for the remainder of the bonus I receive after paying off my credit card/car insurance and buying a gift and keeping that as an ""emergency fund"", even though it will probably only be a couple hundred dollars. 

* 3% of my paycheck before taxes will be going into either a 401k or a Roth 401k. My 401k will be 100% vested. I'm not quite sure what either of these mean in comparison to each other

Sorry for the very long post - I just am very happy and relieved that now I will have the ability to save and make sure I am secure in the future

We're 26F and 36M

We've found a home that we're in love with that's RV is $385k which we could easily afford with our weekly incomes. I'd be paying less than I do in rent at the moment.

Then we got thinking...

We want to have kids in the next few years. Everything I've seen leads me to believe that they're expensive little buggers. Where we live

Neither of us have experience with these sorts of financial commitments and want to know what our priorities should be and how it would be best to proceed.

Do we:

1) forget the dream house and buy something smaller and cheaper that we can pay off much faster

2) go for the dream house because we plan to live there for 20 years

3) delay having kids for a few years (I'm young

4) something else we haven't thought of?

UPDATE: We went and had a proper look at the place today. While it is gorgeous and has a lot of what we need

They also have liens on property of at least $7K. They close on Thursday! Just found out. AAAARRRGH.",aremyparentsidiots,10,0, close the business (it's unsuccessful)

Mom is bad with money and math. She has a small business and they live on site. It's a 3 unit building plus 1/2 acre land. 1 office, but no one is buying the established business, or leasing it. Might be able to scrape $10K by selling off all the assets on land (greenhouse structures, plant inventory, drip system, computers, etc), filing jointly. They live in poverty

They have $60K in other debts from the business and personal combined, the value of the property is maybe $90K on a good day.

The 2nd mortgage was ""called"" and mom couldn't pay $36K. She didn't do anything. Didn't tell us for 3 months, i'll give you 7 years to pay it, for 1% more interest."" Mom and dad say ""okay"". Then the banker says, ""wait. we see you have at least $7K in tax liens here. We need another $2K for fees and interest. Pay us $12K and we'll give you a new 2nd mortgage."" This new 2nd mortgage will take the original outstanding debt on the now 'called loan' from $36K to $28K (approximately) - even though they are paying $12K. They don't really have $12K to pay. They close this Thursday. I read through the lien and collateral notice, and it is a waaaay more complicated document then the original one they signed - it includes wording such as ""if a new lien is placed on the property you have 15 days to discharge it, or the lender can claim loss on their security"" or ""lender must be notified of any insurance payments (regarding damage from wind/fire/etc) within 15 days of causality, and has the right to intercede all payments and apply to indebtedness or to fix claim"". The deed also says the lender has the right of ""sale"" - which makes me think they can sell the property whether mom and dad are in default or not on the 2nd mortgage. The issue about paying off any new liens within 15 days also has me worried, vs indebtedness).

What would you do? What details can I share that make this complicated financial scenario easier to solve for the betterment of my parents? I'm lucky and frugal and not in a position to give them $ to solve their problems, I didn't either, I was just a kid.). I love them. They are kind, honest, and gullible people. If they are homeless, they will live with me, until they get on their feet again. But man, or what? Am I being too harsh? Do I let them loose the $10K they have in hand, when dad retires from his current job

TL:DR Beloved parents have to pay $12K to get a NEW 2nd mortgage in the amount of $28K spread out over 7 years (fixed 5.5% APR) to keep their current home and small business going (after defaulting on the original 2nd mortgage of $50K w/variable 2% above prime - unpaid balance was $36K). The biz is a failure, get their shit together, sell what they can as quietly as they can, and start fresh on my dads salary of $50K/year (due to mom's failing biz, their AGI is $12K/yr). They close on the 2nd mortgage THURSDAY. I'm terrified. Just found out. Please help!",,False,t5_2qwze,True

I was bitten by the travel bug back in college and spent time living abroad. I eventually returned to the US and finished my BA. I got a job at a big corporation, and took a job teaching English in Asia.

My plan was to spend a year working and living on each continent before returning to the US and getting back to the ""real world"". I've been in Japan for 7 years


**Now**

I plan to leave Japan and travel before returning to the US to settle down. I aim to continually travel and work, seeing the world before returning home a burnt out and used up shell of a man.

**Questions**

* I have $72

* How to best earn money while traveling? Income streams I have considered: teaching English (7 years of experience), web developer (just began studying this via online courses).

All of these have expenses under 1% with the highest being .85% FLVCX.

Now recently I watched the Frontline show about indexed funds vs managed funds and was wondering what the hell I was doing in these funds vs Index all these years.  Even though the funds I am in have lower expenses than the ones they talk about in the segment it's still worrying.

http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/business-economy-financial-crisis/retirement-gamble/the-retirement-gamble-facing-us-all/

So now for the questions, FSEVX, FUSVX which have very low Expenses .07 to .17% but I don't know what will happen when I do this.  I currently just log into my account at Fidelity and I can make changes but I don't know what the impact would be, are there fees involved with moving to another fund within our plan?  I guess I will call Fidelity but I wanted to ask here first to see if there are any pitfalls I need to watch out for.  And is it too late to start doing this in your early 50's?

* Overall administration expenses for 2012 and the proposed administration budget for 2013 [APPROVED]
* Annual company budget for the company
* Proposed departmental structure for an expansion plan [APPROVED]
* Proposed structural breakdown per department [APPROVED]

With all this information on a few sheets

* Show him numbers of how he can get from current to the proposed.
* Provide him with a small report which he can show to the Board and get 'it' approved. 
* ''Look'' at the departmental/staff breakdown.
* Show him numbers.
* Expand the sales, expand current departments and provide this information in a condensed form which he can show to the Board of Directors.
*Show him numbers of ''here to there''

Reddit

I simply have no idea what he wants me to do

I do not have enough knowledge to even figure out the technical names of the procedures I am supposed to imply which I could have searched for on Google for templates or examples. 

I read several topics on how to make a business plan but after asking him if that was what he required

The only technical name I have come across is the ''break even analysis''.

Please Reddit

I had to swallow my pride as a hard-working employee and post here under a new account.

I would really like  to know the best ways to raise my credit, I’m just looking for some help to plan the next few years of my life!

A bit of background.: 
-	Employed since June 2007 as receptionist
-	College Graduate with debt
-	Living in southern California 

From July 2007 to January 2012, and had a savings amount that I was happy with. Thankfully, I was able to pay off my car loan. After losing our family business in later 2011, things began to slowly go downhill. Plain and simply, we’ve been struggling to barely make ends meet – faced with a situation between putting food on the table and paying a credit card payment, there was no question in my mind that my finances would have to take a blow. 

Things are beginning to look up again and I’m hoping to regain control of my finances and work towards becoming debt free. Here’s a list of my debts owed. 

Delinquent (No payments made since August 2012)
-	$15
-	$2
-	$1
-	$687.50

Again, and improving my credit score. Currently, I work 40hrs a week @ $13 p/hr. If you could please help me with any advice on basic structures or anything really, I’m open to it!! 

Thank you. It was therapeutic enough to write it out.

1370284698.0,1flhos,Need help on school loan consolidation please.,kristaladele,9,1,4,"Hello Reddit – I was hoping some of you might be kind enough to offer me some financial advice please. Here is my situation:

I have two school loans- 

The first is a Stafford loan. Originally

The second is a private loan through Sally Mae. Originally, the loan is $11,418.94 with an interest rate of 11.75%.  I am making monthly payments of $150.00 on it. I have a cosigner on this one. According to Sallie Mae’s cosigner policy online, I must have 24 consecutive on-time payments to apply for my cosigner’s removal and am two payments away from that mark.

My goal:
I would like to remove my cosigner from the Sallie Mae loan, start rebuilding my credit, and try to tackle my credit card debt. 

My questions:
What is the best course of action? Is loan consolidation the way to go? If so

I should mention at this point that my credit cannot be described in any way other than “horrible.” My credit score is 521 (as of 2 weeks ago). When I was 19/20/21 years old, and here I am today (now 5 ½ years sober with MUCH better spending habits)… I should mention that every single one of those credit cards is in collections. Also, I deal in cash/debit only. I do not have any working credit cards. If I do not have the money in my bank account, I do not buy the item. No exceptions.

Reddit- I am a 27 year-old female. I have a stable job working for the State of California. I want to take responsibility for my debts and the financial mistakes I made in the past

Any help would be so greatly appreciated. If you need any further information or clarification

Thank you in advance for any advice you can give.

TL;DR: I have two school loans that I would like to consolidate. I have a cosigner on one of them. I have seven credit cards in collections and a credit score of 521. I would like to know what the best course of action is to start hacking away at this debt

So far I've been putting all my money into a regular savings account. I have my emergency fund built up already and have enough to last me for 6 months.

A couple things I've been looking at is buying some land and and establishing a place I can live long term as right now I rent. I've found several places around where I wan to be with cheap-ish land that I could pay off in a year or two. With some land I would be able to establish some type of garden and animals which would cut down on my grocery bill and could also provide an additional income source. I grew up on a farm so I know what I'm getting myself in to.

Since I'm still in school my main question is should I go ahead and start paying off student loan debt even though I don't have to start paying for two years? Or would it be okay to go ahead and invest in land and establishing a place to live for the future so I have something that is mine?

During my time in poverty, taking risks, and the like because I knew I had to put something towards it at the end of every month. I feel constricted by it even now. I just feel very tied down. Every month, the interest that accumulates is about 1/3 of the monthly payments. It feels like usury to me. (I know it isn't.) 

I think it's evident that I have a whole score of psychological reasons why I want this gone immediately. But I've worked hard for my money, lurking in the back of my head are fears that the economy will tank again, I will have to try to live on savings, etc, etc. 

Furthermore

So r/FinancialPlanning

Thanks in advance.

I am a 17 year old highschool student, I've made quite a nice chunk-o-change in the past week: around $250, and I will be doing this for the next month (atleast). I expect to bring in somewhere around 1k. I would like to know what to do with that money so that I can have it work for me. Currently I have a savings account (I throw about 50% of any gift money, plus occasionally money from work I do elsewhere), and a Debit card which is link to my parents account. What should I do with my money that I can have some in the next 3-5 years for an emergency, and longer down the road, perhaps saving for a house or any other big expense?

Wife and I moved a couple years ago, so she can spend more time with our children.

Throughout this whole ordeal

A few of our details:

* Currently have about $10
* In March
* My bonus this year should be around $1000.  We expect to save that towards a trip to my wife's sister's wedding this summer.  It needs to be easily accessible
* I'd really love to look into some basic stocks and mutual funds.
* We won't be putting all of the savings away somewhere
* Also, I feel like it can do more for us.

We should be able to contribute around another $5000 to $10000 per year.

I have a full time job that pays 30k a year. 
I have 5k in debt for school. 
2k in random investment. 
25k loan for 5 years at 3%.

I have little expenses for food and housing as my job provides that. 
Should I start putting money into a Roth IRA or Traditional IRA?
