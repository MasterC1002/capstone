I know this is generalizing

I for one would rather see a game released with a $10-$20 price tag

I have spent good money on the Android store on games that are more expensive that provide good playability, stop feeding us crap, eventually people are just going to stop supporting you.

Edit:
I should clarify, especially a game that you have already paid for. Real Racing 3 is a game that, in my opinion, does IAP very well. Anything you can do in the game can be done without payment, you can access all the tracks and I think all the cars, and while you can use IAP to speed up repair times or unlock things earlier, you don't need to. Shipwrecked, and everything is technically unlockable without paying for anything. It may take some time to save up the required currency and swords and gold are difficult to obtain,,1366612488.0

5. Installed gb68k on the ti-89 by putting it on the SD Card and using the ""Send File"" feature in Graph 89.
6. Converted Pokemon Red into files that gb68k could read by using a converter that came with the gb68k download.
7. Put the Pokemon files on my SD Card and loaded it up on Graph 89. (There were 18 files but I had to do it three at a time because there is very littler RAM in the TI-89 so you have to archive it).
8. I loaded up Pokemon by opening gb68k and I adjusted the ""configuration settings"" in Graph 89 so that grayscale was on and cpu was set to a speed so that the game was playable (200% for me).

That's it! I had fun showing it off to my friends. The speed is decent. There is a bit of lag sometimes but it's definitely playable. Of course,False,self,t5_2s2ul,1367808714.0,,,t3_1drofr

So, your new title requires you to establish mining and research operations in a solar system far far away.

So

Drop a command center

But be careful!  Space is dangerous.  Disasters are rolled every turn, so prepare for the inevitable and it's arrival will be enjoyable.

**OK

The core features are *almost* finished.  I think I got three or so tasks left before it's even fully playable.  All the systems are in place *except* your buildings cannot be destroyed

**Here's what you can do**

 * Traverse the solar system by flinging right and left.  On the webdemo

 * Visit a planet by tapping on it

 * While visiting a planet

 * Tap `Base`, and then hit next turn.

 * build other buildings

 * fires and floods can occur in a building every turn

 * perform the 'open airlock' action to put out a fire or drain a flood.

**so what's next?**

 * health and colonies getting destroyed.  This will require functionality for restarting a colony.
 * per building upgrade slots
 * resource system
 * a tech tree to spend science on
 * more actions per building and hooking up the remaining ones
 * many many more disasters and unique patterns of actions required to negate them (over multiple turns).
 * and much more!


So check it out please

In Subway Surfers, and the first egg at about 15000 (it comes closer to 26000 if the powerup is a 2x). So I've been farming the first egg drop for a long time trying to get 100. The second egg doesn't drop for much longer, so it's much easier just to die at 20-whatever-thousand points and go again.

A little about the boot mechanics - If you have the jump boots (Subway Surfers), you will pick it up. Even if the item is on the ground level. If you're in a high jump and the boots wear off, you will stop picking up coins/items when the boots wear off, even mid-air. It took some trial and error to figure this out, and there aren't a ton of situations it effects.

I've personally felt there are a few problems when it comes to Android gaming

 - Knowing which games are actually fun / worth my time
 - Finding information about in-app purchases
 - The controls. As in

So I spent the last week creating a website that aims to solves those issues.

**However**

There are a few problems:

 - I have no idea if other people share these issues
 - I have no idea if my site would be the solution
 - I have no idea if my site actually provides the solution

So if you have some time

**Few points about the site**

I really can't afford to spend months creating the 'perfect vision' of a website if there isn't any actual need for it. So the site is quite basic

It has most of the important things, images of in-game advertising (you'll see the relevant section).

The left side bar that says ""top gaming deals"" will feature gaming deals from around various networks (steam etc). This will also feature games from Amazon which would be affiliate links. An example of one possible way I plan to monetise the site. 

Also there are sections that can easily be added / removed. For example under 'Cytus'

**What I need from you**

Would you actually use it?

Any feedback would be awesome! It would be even more awesome if you could give any opinion on things you would want to see from the site. For example I still need to add in a section about which devices the game is compatible with.

I'll be around until about 7PM (UK Time) but will respond to any messages I miss tomorrow.

Thanks guys.

**EDIT** Forgot to add, including a mobile version of the site etc. Just have to make sure I actually have a real solution to a real problem.",,False,self,t5_2s2ul,1359213120.0,,

After a lot of work in order to make the most out of the game

I'm afraid that if it keeps not selling I will have to suspend my academic education and find a job since I won't be able to sustain it. And this is where I need your help - spread the word about my game! Try out the demo, tell the world about it.

I love being a game developer and I believe this can be a great jump start into the gaming industry. If you support indie games

I already have big plans for my next game and I'm sure all of you will love it

I'm looking for (and will be saddened when nothing turns up) a game similar to [Kerbal Space Program](https://kerbalspaceprogram.com/)

These games all have a similar

I want extremely meticulous planning, planning, rebuilding, failing .. Things like that. Graphics are secondary, but they can't be so bad as OpenTTD.. That just looked awful. I mean, Dwarf Fortress doesn't *try* to look good, which is why it's ok to me.

I just thought I'd share my experience playing GBA games, so no Mario, no WarioWare, et cetera. Here's a few good, playable compromises:


GOLDEN SUN: Duh. This works for any turn-based RPG. Super easy to control.


ADVANCE WARS: Another duh, and on my GS3 everything just pops.


CASTLEVANIA - ARIA OF SORROW: This is perhaps not an obvious choice, and careful timing than it was about really exact controls. The HP system is forgiving, too: In Mario, you mess up, you die, whereas in Castlevania, you lose, what

MARIO GOLF: I didn't pick this one up when I had a GBA, but every time, you get better and it gets harder.

NEED FOR SPEED - MOST WANTED: I haven't really played this that much yet. But after hearing that the Play store's Need For Speed game nickel-and-dimes you after you pay for the game (!)

That's all I've played so far. I'd love to hear other experiences with GBA games,False,self,t5_2s2ul,False,,,t3_16y6au

I couldn't get ambient sounds, but nothing seemed to get the sound working.

I knew that the original DOS version came with an installation program and audio setup utility

If you've bought Fallout 1 from GOG

A second hurdle presented itself: The Mac version is a .dbg file. No problem

Reasoning that what worked with Daggerfall could possibly work with Fallout

Requirements:

* GOG version of Fallout 1
* 7-Zip file manager
* DosBox Turbo

1. Download the Mac version of Fallout 1 from GOG.
2. Open the .dbg file in 7-Zip's file manager.
3. Open the 4.hfs file within the .dbg file.
4. Follow the directory paths: Fallout/Fallout.app/Contents/Resources/Fallout.boxer/D Fallout.cdrom
5. Extract the entire contents of the ""D Fallout.cdrom"" directory to any path on your Android device. (I'll refer to the full path as [YourCDFolder] below)
6. Add this line to the start of your dosbox.conf file's Autoexec section\*:
    mount d: [YourCDFolder] -ioctl -label Fallout -t cdrom
7. You should also have a line which refers to ""mount c:"". Add this to the end of it\**:
    -freesize 700
8. Start DosBox. You can now install from the virtual version of the original CD in drive D. (Run INSTALL.EXE)
9. After installing
10. You can now use the sound utility's autodetection feature
11. You can now run Fallout.exe

\* - This line sets the contents of [YourCDFolder] as a CD-ROM with the disc label ""Fallout"" inserted into drive D. I don't know that the original disc was labeled ""Fallout""

\** - This is so the installation program sees that the target drive has enough free space to hold the game.

\*** - You may need to use SB16 in your dosbox.conf file. I wasn't able to get the sound utility to detect other versions of Sound Blaster.",self,t5_2s2ul,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/160izn/if_youve_been_having_trouble_getting_fallout_to/

I realise I got a little carried away with AndEngine on this project and being a mostly text game I don't think I needed to use it.  This is something I have learned for the future though and hopefully I won't waste time reinventing (badly!) the wheel!

The game is very simple stages at the moment

The model of the game is quite interconnected.  You run a political party from various starting points in history and you must please your voters aligning your parties political stance with any gaps in the market while proposing popular votes for all parties to vote on.  

For example you may only have 10% of the seats in government when you start the game

Wether this is just a passing fad or here to stay in one form or another

Developers need to earn money to make and run their games. On the Android market and I think on the IOS market, on reddit at least, are fine with playing a game for free but get all riled up when they need to pay to continue.

I've bought many full priced games in my life and played games with subscriptions (WoW). My opinion on the ""freemium"" model is shifting a bit. There must be a right and a wrong way to do it. Where is the line ?

What kills the controller (for me, which is expected. 

However, which they label as *beta* (which is a generous overstatement) available in the play store. It is supposed to have support to map touch controls, which they advertise on the box of the controller, however they mention in their barren FAQ on their site that it is a WIP and should be added Q1 of this year, 2013. Then, in that same post, they mention that due to restrictions in android 4.1

The box claims to support 1000's of games; which it might, with no phone UI of any sort. 

The app also runs in the background

The app is finicky

The included stock control layouts are only for ~8 games

You cannot use any sort of gamepad mapping app, etc. to configure the controls. They either do not support (Bluez) or do not recognize (joystick center) the controller at all. 

A few emulators that have native gamepad support and offer control mapping work well

Please feel free to ask clarifying questions or discuss amongst yourselves in the comments.*


Survivalcraft does not have multiplayer yet but the community sharing feature makes up for it. The dev has built in an **in-game sharing system** so you can easily upload and share your builds and try others. Same for block textures. Some say that MCPE has better textures than SC

SC has **better developer support**. Even though SC is developed by just one person it consistently adds new features, like a full year it was ridiculous) and just recently has been becoming a decent game. For a long time it seemed Mojang had forgotten about it.

With just it's one man development team SC has managed to add features that the MCPE devs dismiss. **Infinite worlds**, citing limitations in mobile processing yet SC has *all those things*. Plus, **weather effects** (snow, rain, thunder and lightening), a **realistic sky** with sun and moon and stars. I mean, a *beautiful* sky. Sunsets and sunrises paint the sky ablaze in colors. I've spent many screenshots just on sunsets and rises. MCPE players were recently excited when they introduced a couple white blocky puffs in the sky for clouds yet there is still no sun or moon.

The world of SC is **alive**! Various birds populate the skies and lay their eggs in the grasses. Bulls keep a watchful eye on their cows, including sharks, 2 kinds of manta rays, and piranha and also **horses that can be tamed and ridden**.

SC has **electrics!** Pressure plates, lights, detonators, switches, buttons, LEDs, whatever you need for your Rube Goldberg dreams!

**Mining is not a chore in SC**! Immense branching **cave systems** give easy access to underground resources. The resources you find are plentiful

The developers of MCPE have stated that desktop MC style crafting cannot be easily done on mobile and instead have this cheap feeling list system for crafting. SC has **real MC style crafting** and it is intuitive and works great

SC has **fire**. Seriously

If you are interested in Survivalcraft please join us in /r/survivalcraftthegame. Thank you for reading.

EDIT: Check out the [Survivalcraft blog here](http://kaalus.wordpress.com/) to see what updates to SC are in store and to see the kind of attention that the dev shows to the game and it's players.

**An additional thought**

MCPE developers have confirmed that the next update won't be out until [at least the end of April](https://twitter.com/jbernhardsson/status/313656714509565954) and Survivalcraft [only costs $4](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.candyrufusgames.survivalcraft&amp;feature=nav_other#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDYsImNvbS5jYW5keXJ1ZnVzZ2FtZXMuc3Vydml2YWxjcmFmdCJd) so really **you should just buy SC** even if you already own MCPE or plan on buying MCPE.

I'd love to play some good Android games. Some games that will still be good in 5 or 10 years. Some games that could make people say ""I want to buy a smartphone just to play THIS game"".

But most games I find on the Play Store are essentially all the same. Some Doodle Jump clone, yet-another match3 game with in-app mediocrity, city growing games, one button arcadey games (think Jetpack Joyride), quizz games, etc...
I don't want to play flash games from 10 years ago, connected device BECAUSE touchscreen, mobility and connectiveness suits them best. Games tailored for an Android device, that may even be bad games on another platform, but are real masterpiece on a smartphone/tablet.

I may have missed some real good games

Some websites show the best new games

So what I propose is monthly lists of ""what are you playing"". Tell us what currently has your attention. Give us a couple and if something has had your focus for more than an afternoon let us know!

They don't have to be new. You don't have to give a review

My current list

1. [Little Empire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.camelgames.fantasyland&amp;feature=search_result) - Really enjoy coming back to this game.

2. [Dungeon Raid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fireflame.dungeonraid&amp;feature=search_result) - way addicting. I feel like I get the shaft a bit on leveling up and unlocking classes though. Easy to re-pick up. Very unique in a good way. I love seeing this blend of new casual with older concepts because the casual is so much better suited for phones but they have lost the conceptual appeal I love with soldiers/knights/etc etc. Also you will definitely know whether or not you want to keep it within 15 minutes.

3. [Robotek](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.hexage.robotek.hd&amp;feature=search_result) - nice little game for when your bored. Low attention

4. [chess.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.chess&amp;feature=search_result) - I have multiple online games running. They have videos to help teach you basics. Subscription not necessary for basic videos (for more advanced then yes).

5. [Battleloot Adventures](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.dtales.BLA&amp;feature=search_result) - I really want to like this game. If they make a second game I'm definitely going to take another look. I also wish the pace was increased. I keep playing it briefly again though.

after a great

It turns out that this emulator runs Mame .139 and their seems to monopoly on these roms as the only site I found (if google for this romset) wants you to be a premium member to download. So I found a working torrent on XDA, you need roms that are taylored .139 Mame, which is a complete pain in the ass.

But after playing Aliens vs predator, Metal Slug it was well worth the massive download. 

I know were not here to promote piracy

**EDIT** Also note that many of the roms I tested DO NOT work with the alternative emulator Mame4Droid (.037b5)
and work only on  MAME4droid reloaded (0.139) so doing a little research at this time to see if Mame4droid reloaded is the better choice...

Also note that that reloaded supports more rom sets and allows saving

So it seems Reloaded is the better option.

So I just got an Android tablet and decided to find out what videogames it had to offer. For the most part

Here's a list of games I have found entertaining and relatively easy to control without some sort of gamepad peripheral.



**Free Games:**

[Dead Trigger](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.madfingergames.deadtrigger&amp;feature=search_result) - FPS. You kill zombies for free. Good visuals.

[Order &amp; Chaos Duels](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftBTHM&amp;feature=search_result) - CCG. Not nearly as deep as some of its competitors

[Angry Birds](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rovio.angrybirds&amp;feature=search_result) - To be honest

[Fruit Ninja](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.halfbrick.fruitninjafree&amp;feature=search_result) - Slide finger across screen. Cut fruit. I don't know how to explain it

[Plants vs Zombies](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.popcap.pvz_row&amp;feature=search_result) - Get those zombies off your lawn with plants. Even better on android than it was when I played it on my PC. Them touch controls.

[Solitaire](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.brainium.solitairefree&amp;feature=search_result) - The best version of Klondike on the app store in my opinion. Slick interface and great customization.



**Paid Games:**

[Bejeweled 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.eamobile.bejeweled2_row_wf&amp;feature=search_result) - It's okay. Blunt honesty? I've had more fun emulating the old Pokemon Puzzle Challenge game for the GBC.

[Battleheart](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.KelliNoda.Battleheart&amp;feature=search_result) - Strategy RPG. There are MANY free clones out there

[Worms 2: Armageddon](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.worms2armageddon.app&amp;feature=search_result) - The controls are not as tight as I hoped

[Rayman Jungle Run](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pastagames.ro1mobile&amp;feature=search_result) - Platformer. Rayman meets Temple Run. Easy to grasp, say, Sonic 4.

[Penny Arcade 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tinkerhousegames.paa3&amp;feature=search_result) - Hilarious retro-RPG from the good folks at PA. Sucks that you literally play the story on rails

[Anomaly Korea](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.elevenbitstudios.AnomalyKorea&amp;feature=search_result) - I own the steam version of the first title and love it. Got this one, and plays great.

[Final Fantasy 3](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.FFIII_GP&amp;feature=search_result) - This is the Nintendo DS version of FF3 with touch controls and higher internal resolution. If you don't own this on the DS

[Dead Space](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.deadspace_row&amp;feature=search_result) - Surprisingly good visuals and perfect framerate. A third person shooter with controls that are easy to pick up. Haven't played much of it yet,,False,self,t5_2s2ul,False,,True

Take the recent ouya

They got more response in the general sub than here.

/r/android has more than 263.000 subsscribers and /r/androidgaming only a few over 12.000

My brother and I started an indie studio a few months back and are on our way
to our first full launch. We're terrified and excited

Towelfight 2: The Monocle of Destiny is a crazy blend between Zelda and the Binding of Isaac that has you free a god from his unwanted prison by shooting animals out of your face.

[Absolute craziness later on](https://twitter.com/BScotchShenani/status/294221439148621824/photo/1)

It has 4 zones, and a Pug. Our rough guess of playtime is about 8-14 hours, depending on how often you DIE.

We're nearly there and are doing a few weeks of beta testing before the launch to make sure the game is as sound as it can possibly be. We've already gotten a bucketful of feedback from some redditors and thought we'd formalize the process

Here's a [box.net]( https://www.box.com/s/f0gwdolr1szhz7ytrzoy) link to the apk, is set to expire on March 1st.

We're planning on releasing it for $2.99. We aren't keen on IAP but realize that some people like being able to get upgrades super fast

We'll respond to feedback you post here

**EDIT:**
We've been polishing, and slapping this thing into shape since yesterday, based on your feedback and some testing of our own. We're uploading a new APK, which you can download and install from the original link. Your save data will carry over between versions, so no progress lost!

Just an example is this flash game I used to play on my laptop called ""Kingdom Rush"". I saw it was ported on Android and bought it since it had a 4.7 rating and was a successful port.

The game was just like what I played free on my laptop on a website. I soon realized that they had added a new currency which would buy you extra weapons

I hate the fact that when you buy games they still have 2 or 3 kinds of in game currency

I think that at least in the paid games the play store should tell you in advance if a game has additional content you have to pay for because I wouldn't buy it purely for that reason. Also users keep rating these games 5^* to further promote this model.

Even worse is that I can use GameCIH to give me as much of this third currency so you are never getting anything exclusive and in each one of these games,000 pounds to reach that.",,False,self,t5_2s2ul,False,,

Personally, have my doubts on its overall quality (horribly slow interface).  Hit a dead-end in Spectral Souls - really want to get into that game but the depth of this SRPG is kicking my ass right now.  Kemco's Symphony of Eternity bought on sale as well - but that's embarrassingly easy.  Would love to get a final fantasy game but their pricing is very steep - got chaos rings on sale and it was really disappointing (personally).

1359408506.0,17gag3,Why I am developing an Android game,gameofinches,25,11,4,"Hi /r/AndroidGaming

I have been working on an Android football game for a bit now and wanted to share why. About a year ago I discovered [John Elway's Quarterback Challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1M0pmI_9s7Q) and loved it. Soon after I bought 2 of [these](http://www.amazon.com/Classic-USB-NES-Controller-PC/dp/B002YVD3KM) and was playing it and [Tecmo Super Bowl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PBvOxicz-0) with my friends all the time.

After expending my friends' patience I moved on to Android. I searched high and low and couldn't find a football game that would satisfy my addiction for games like the two mentioned above. That's when I decided to start working on a football game myself. 

Right now it's my side project and development is so very slow since my job takes priority. That is why I just launched a [Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/108259147/game-of-inches) and hope to raise the funding to allow me to work on it full time. I know 15K seems like a lot but I assure you every cent goes into the game. 

Here is a list of all the Android games I have tried as well as some notes and their ratings. Hopefully this list helps those like me until I can get Game of Inches on the market. 
________________

**2D Top-Down Arcade Style Football Games**
&gt; These are what I love. Sadly none of the following are even near being considered completed games. 

[Super Touchdown](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apostek.apps.touchfootball) *4.3 Stars* - Not too bad but very easy to figure out how to score every play. 

[Go Long! Football](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=wco.android.golongpc) *3.8 Stars* - A unique mechanic but forces you to choose a receiver at the start of each play. 

[Phil's Football](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.philgame) *3.8 Stars* - Sloppy art and interface. Design is awkward

________________

**3D Football Games**
&gt;Most of these to be very well built and pretty to look at but not very user friendly. If I want to play a realistic football game I would do so at home on my X-Box. 

[NFL PRO 2013](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gameloft.android.ANMP.GloftF3HM) *4.5 Stars*

[Mobile Linebacker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viva.linebacker&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *4.2 Stars*

[Backbreaker 2](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ideaworks3d.tackle2&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *3.3 Stars*

[NFL Rivals](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.naturalmotion.nflrivals&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *2.7 Stars*
________________

**Football Simulators**
&gt;Basically you get to be the coach and pick the plays as well as trade players. Very different from the traditional arcade style football but great for people who like fantasy sports. 

[Big Win FOOTBALL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.hotheadgames.google.free.bigwinfootball) *4.3 Stars* - This is definelty worth taking a look at if you like simulators. Very well done and beautiful environment. 

[Touch Foorball Beta](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.anndconsulting.touchfootballbeta) *3.2 Stars* - Terrible

[tXtFL](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textflex.txtflmobile) *3.4 Stars* - Fairly boring and not intuitive. 
________________

**Single Task**
&gt;These have taken a single aspect from football and made a mini-game out of it. 

[Flick Kick Field Goal](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.pikpok.kikfg&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *4.3 Stars*

[NFL QB 13](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fullfat.android.quarterback13&amp;feature=top-paid) *3.4 Stars*
________________

**Other?**
&gt;Weird stuff

[Football Golf](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.morens.games.footballgolf) *No Raitings* - I was really digging deep when I found this gem. This game is actually a lot of fun and the only reason I included and other section. It's not perfect but I would certainly recommend it. 

[AutoBall Football](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.testbed121.autbol&amp;feature=apps_topselling_paid) *4.6 Stars* - Play solitaire to gain yardage?",self,t5_2s2ul,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidGaming/comments/17gag3/why_i_am_developing_an_android_game/

[1$ version](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.steve.game)

**What's new in v1.6:**

* A new friggin' enemy type! It's time to change up the gameplay flow a bit!

* New asset class - Turrets! **Holy crap!**

* New voice sound effect for when a resource collector dies. It's my own voice

* Bug fixes: Steering in survival mode polished

* Changed the Help/License GUI a bit.

----------

**Method to unlock full version from free version:**

**1)** Since the full version lets you access mission 4 and beyond

**2)** Get to the point where you fight the boss (as long as the boss exists in the game world at this point)

**3)** Go into the pause/upgrade menu, then go back again, etc. Do this 11 or so times without exiting/going back to gameplay, and you'll hear a sound effect. When you hear that effect, you've unlocked the full version! Yay!

**4)** Save that variable by either winning
