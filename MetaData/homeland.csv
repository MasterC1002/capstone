Dana grows fond of Finn as Brody loves his country. Dana and Finn get excited by the thrill of evading the SS and speeding as Brody goes to war. Finn commits the immoral act of hiting the woman without coming out and publicly taking responsibility as Walden commits the immoral act of killing dozens of people with the drone strike. 

Therefore:
(Dana)/(Brody) both (sympathize with)/(love) the (innocent pedestrian)/(Issa). 

Both Brodys feel both Waldens are to blame for murder. The obvious difference is the scale and importance, is somewhat justified in his action or lack thereof, and how the Brodys both are very morally righteous, but both still must bend to the superior forces of (in Dana's case) the will of her father (CIA reasons) and the will of the Waldens (government reasons) and (in Brody's case) the CIA, Walden and Nasir (though the last 2 not so much). 

I feel that the writers' purpose was to compare these 2 events and foreshadow one with the other. Also,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,,t3_1ahti5

6. Brody explained Nazir's master plan to Carrie after the explosion

I. Expectations

Anyone who's watched a fair amount of television will attest to the fact that most of what's on air is fairly formulaic. Some shows are blatantly so - crime and law procedurals have such a well defined set of rules that most viewers have a pretty good idea of what's going to happen within the first few minutes of an episode. Sitcoms have their own trove of set pieces that writers seem to draw from all the time. Even serialized shows come with a set of expectations and for the most part stay within them. 

This is not necessarily a bad thing. The Wire is easily one of the best shows ever made, the city would be city. It didn't matter because the character stories were so rich and the ending so truly reflective of world we live in that just following the narrative path to a foregone conclusion was enough to create great television. 

I bring up the patterns of television because Homeland does not operate in a vacuum. When we watch Homeland we're looking for similarities to things we've seen before and we do see some similarities we make assumptions about what those similarities means based on previous experiences. What has set apart Homeland and makes it such a great example of television is how its able to organically break past those assumptions and surprise us at every turn even though we're expecting it to do exactly that. I'm sure many, tracking and unraveling leads. Instead in the final minutes of the episode we witnessed a development that in the hands of lesser writers would have been saved for a season finale. 

While this ability to buck expectations is one of the show's key strengths, and I'm happy to have had my concerns blown away because those moments were the most riveting Homeland has ever been.

II. Carrie and Brody

Part of the reason Brody's shift to becoming a CIA asset was inevitable of course was because it was what needed to happen for the story to go on. This development however is almost impossible to do in a convincing manner because as Carrie rightly says, she was able to lay out infront of him what he couldn't see so that he could make a more informed decision. 

Which brings me to the point that the heart of this show isn't the drama or tension. It's the undeniable connection that these two broken people share and can't help but acknowledge to each other. Even without Carrie and Brody interacting the past few episodes have been pretty good

The situation that they find themselves in now gives them ample opportunity to do just that over the rest of the season and I look forward to seeing what comes of it.

III. Delivery

The thing is

Danes is having what is probably the best season long performance ever by a female actress and has been nothing short of incredible every episode to date but tonight she was totally upstaged by Lewis' face as she interrogated him. If there isn't another Emmy double in store for them I'll be very surprised.

Also notable is Morgan Saylor's turn as Dana. She manages to be the moody teenager while in no way being annoying as most of these kinds of characters tends to be but it's really her moments with Brody that stand out with even the unspoken glances speaking volumes.

IV. War on Terror

It's easy to get so swept in the character moments that you forget to notice the other points the show is trying to make but I again have to commend Homeland for its unflinching willingness to continue to ask questions about the morality of the actions taken by both sides in the War on Terror. 

I think Carrie raises a pretty interesting point when she compares Abu Nazir and VP Walden. One is of course wildly different from the other. The former intentionally targets innocent civilians while the other just happens to kill them in the process of doing other things. But what Carrie projects to Brody is that their willingness to sacrifice innocent lives to achieve their goals is equally despicable. I wonder if others got the same read of the line as I did but I thought it was worth pointing out nonetheless. 

TL;DR I know this is really long but I encourage you to read it if you're looking for a more in depth discussion of Homeland. Disagreements with my take are welcome and would be appreciated in the comments.",self,t5_2smlq,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/129lyx/thoughts_on_s02e05_qa/

One of the mods messaged me in agreement and asked if I would like to get one started.

So here it is.  I will start it off with a few FAQs that I know of and compile answers from older threads.  In the comments feel free to add your own topics or questions that maybe you still have yourself

Also


**1.) What is with the mole talk?  How do we know there is a mole?**

The mole is an ongoing mystery that has not been solved. They even highlight it in [this season 2 trailer.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CJoEz38T1uo)

We know there is a mole that is responsible for the following things:

* Someone tipped off the couple (Aileen and Middle Eastern professor) living in the house with the roof by the airport that Tom Walker had visited. They were actually likely tipped off twice. The first time if you remember the professor was being followed home by Carrie and Galvez, but it is likely that they were tipped off to leave the house by the mole who knew the CIA were coming.

* Someone warned Tom Walker that the CIA had ""turned"" the Saudi Ambassador. That is how Walker knew to give the briefcase bomb to a homeless man to hand to the ambassador instead of showing up himself. That's what Saul is talking about with Carrie in the hospital bed after she got blown up in the above video.

* We also know so far from season 2 events that the mole is still active because someone had to give the female reporter the codes to David Estes' safe which she in turn passed on to Brody to get some kind of possible attack locations.

* This one is less important, or that the guy had it in the sole of his shoe like they suggested, but it may have been the mole. This particular mystery will most likely never be solved at this point, but it is another event which points to possibility of their being a mole that the CIA knows about. That's why in the above video after the ""who is the mole"" text flashes on screen they show the dead prisoner's body.

The writer's themselves have commented on the mole and hinted that he/she might never be revealed because often times in real life situations the security leak is never discovered. That isn't to say it won't happen

**2.) Why isn't the CIA taking more action to discover the mole or why isn't it discussed more often?**

The mole was mentioned by Saul and Carrie a few times in season 1, and them maintaining a small operation off-campus to deal with Brody among other things.  Mostly the mole just serves the purpose of making the plot feasible.  It is possible that it will play a larger role in a future episode, or might otherwise not be revisited.

**3.)  Is Saul the mole?  Saul is definitely the mole right?**

No, or act in a manner which would be beneficial to Abu Nazir's operation.  In every circumstance he has acted according to what you would expect from a dedicated CIA employee.  

One of the most significant examples of this was outlined by u/robdag2 [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/homeland/comments/12nol2/alright_who_is_the_mole_spoilers/c6wpwsu)

&gt;It can't be Saul.  He was the one who discovered the Brody tape. If he was the mole

The only event which points to the possibility of Saul being a mole


**4.)  Damian Lewis has been signed on to play Brody for 5 more years.  Does that mean he is guaranteed to be alive and/or an active character for 5 more seasons?**

[Source](http://seriable.com/homeland-damian-lewis-5-seasons/)

No, or it might last 10 more.  Brody may survive this whole time, be killed next week and never seen again, or a combination where he only appears in flashbacks.  Anything is possible; nothing is certain.

**5.)  Why does Jessica call her husband by his last name (Brody)**

There are numerous possible reasons/explanations for this.  The general consensus is that while it is not terribly common

* It's not specifically a military matter
* Lots of men (and occasionally women) are referred to by their last names by close friends and colleagues in America; in case you are asking from a cultural perspective. 
* If she met him while he was in the military
* Often times, and then when they begin dating the name just sticks.
* They may have met in high school,False,self,t5_2smlq,1353391609.0,,,t3_13hovn

1355862747.0,152ho2,Quinn and Saul cannot be moles.,littlepwny,48,11,63,"After the last episode I have seen many people say that Saul or Quinn are the CIA moles due to the fact that Quinn spared Brody

First of all

1. He joined the party way too late. The mole knew that Estes's safe contained an encryption key to a database of potential list of targets and also knew the code to the safe. In addition

2. Gettysburg Address episode.During this episode, he was shot and had to play dead in order to survive and only thanks to him pressuring Brody did Brody actually tell them that the tailor is actually dead.

3. Quinn's association with a notorious black ops commander gives him a lot of credibility.

4. Quinn was never guaranteed to be in the task force. Estes asked Dar Adhul for an assassin and Quinn was eventually sent. Quinn joining the group , who seems like an old school person who cares about his country, would also have to be deeply involved.

5. Throughout his involvement with the team he has been shown to have flawless decision making, Brody's political career is officially over and hence he has become a non-threat to the nation and simply remains a threat to Estes because of the knowledge of the drone strike. The video, by the way, could have been released to the public regardless of whether Brody is alive or not. In fact Brody being dead would be more in line with the suicide style of attacks these terrorist organisations are accustomed to.

6. Both of the Brody kill sequences point Quinn towards the CIA side. In the limo scene he was shown to be ready to kill Brody and the stalking sequence/finger on the trigger would never have happened if he simply never intended for the trigger to be pulled.

7. Regardless of if Brody was killed or not, Brody was never needed.With all this in mind I believe that Quinn has probably been cleared of all mole accusations, him being the mole would leave huge plotholes.

Let's look at Saul case.

1. He could have stopped Carrie's investigation on Brody.

2. He could have not released the video to Carrie. In fact he could have hidden the video from everyone.

3. He could have stopped the Abu Nazir assassination mission from happening or even sent a ""May 1st"" message to protect his cover.

4. Aileen knew nothing about the terrorist cell

5. He failed the lie detector because he was in distress because of his home situation.

6. He did not want Brody to die because he considers himself a good person and mainly because it would destroy Carrie.

With all the above I believe it is clear that Saul cannot possibly be the mole. Also

TL;DR: Neither Quinn nor Saul are moles.

I want to point out a scene between Saul and Estes from earlier this season. Saul reveals the tape of Brody confessing to being a terrorist, and thereby revealing Brody as a terrorist ruins Este's career. After all, he's the CIA Director who let a terrorist become a congressman. He so much as says ""FML"" right then and there.

But then Saul offers an alternative, to get more intel on the Nazir and stop any future attacks.

The only problem with Saul's plan, still revealed as a terrorist, and it will still ruin the career of not only David Estes, but any other organization or operative who may have failed in revealing Brody as a terrorist, before becoming an elected official. The fallout from such a scandal would results in uncountable charges, loss of morale, reactionary budget cuts

Though, he's a martyr for the United States, a marine becoming a POW, coming home to become a congressman, struck down by terrorist? He'll be mourned, Estes will be given more funding, more support

So Estes is cleaning up lose ends, deception and red tape to do it.

And where does that leave our characters? Well Brody, and former terrorist. Carry is a nut job, and Saul, well this past episode we see all the dirt they have on Saul. 

Very dramatic indeed, we retaliate, but what do we do when the threat, like Brody from season 1, is right here on our soil, when the threat is one of us. Or even scarier, when the threat is part of the agency we rely on for protection?

Just some thoughts.

It would have been a ridiculous stretch for them to piece together the limited knowledge they have to figure out Brody was a terrorist.  So I really enjoyed how the writers used Lauder's and subsequently Mike's suspicions to have them piece together a conspiracy but of course the wrong one altogether.  Instead of letting Lauder's suspicions continue to go completely ignored by everyone

Anyway, now that Jessica knows, I could possibly see Mike presenting his suspicion to her with a line of questioning or in a subtle manner that unintentionally results in her assuming he already knows about Brody's position and confirms it to him.  As for how it will affect Brody's cover and/or the overall plot remains to be seen.

* Abu Nazir will still remain alive and well meaning that Brody will be alive at the end of the season. I think this also will mean that Brody won't know about Quinn being hired to kill Brody after the mission has been completed.

* Roya will kill herself during her investigation. She won't reveal anything of use.

* While Brody won't know about Quinn, but will try and convince Estes not to.

* We know that Abu Nazir knows about Brody's betrayal from next episode's previews (his threat to Brody). In retaliation

* Not an exciting prediction

It is hard to believe that killing Brody off would benefit Estes' immediate line of work

My best theory is that some authority wants to use Brody (and his death) as a catalyst to possibly segue into a war in galvanizing public anti-terrorism sentiments.  We know that Brody is highly regarded in the public's eye

The bomb-maker didn't screw up the vest, because we SAW the light on the vest go green. Then Brody got knocked down in the rush to get inside the building and the wires got disconnected or something. I felt like nothing was too contrived and the drama we did end up getting felt well-deserved. Maybe I'm just getting too worked up about people disagreeing with me on the internet.

That said looking at a calender and knowing I have to wait nearly 9 months is killing me. So much is left unknown/unsaid at the extremely shocking end to season two.

My main question is whether or not Brody planned/helped/knew about the bomb in his car or not. There are arguments to be made for both sides but I can't help but feel he was a part of it.

I personally feel he was involved in the final bombing plot. There is just too much going on for any rational skeptic to accept but he has exploited Carrie's irrationality. 

in semi-chronological order:

a.) he didnt make any contact whatsoever about her abduction

b.) he not only helped kill the VP by giving the correct serial number, this implies that he isn't cured, that he still believes in vengeance over justice

c.) he still cared about his family

d.)he has shown the ability to fake love before

e.)he knew he was still a target, and tried to torture you appear unexpectedly would definitely throw you off

f.) carrie shows poor judgement after traumatic events

g.)Carrie was always right

h.) He has been hiding things, and not just to the CIA but to everyone and not all of them incriminating.

i.) he is a pathological liar, I know from firsthand experience how even the nicest person you have ever known would lie to you about both the most mundane details and spectacular plans and you are conditioned to want to believe them on both counts

j.) his time up at the cabin took attention off wherever he left his vehicle

k.) his identification of his car and the wording of it, the parking lot at langley has probably 8k employees on site, most of whom drive, he isn't a regular at langley and doesnt know what others might drive, how is just seeing a car from 10+ stories up the same make/color of yours a positive identification it was yours, it wasn't hey that car looks like mine, or does that car look like mine, that whole ""someone"" is very suspicious too

l.) the detentation method, its too convenient for it to have happened after they were out of the blast radius

l.) brody loves fucking with carrie's head

m.) for a guy who was supposedly turned, it always felt that she cared more about him

n.) it's just a better fucking story, i fucked up and oh yeah, im bipolar"" we have the effects of that on carrie's psyche, her discovering and trying to hide that she unknowingly aided a terrorist, you have the ultimate confrontation with saul and how much he learns and how far he is willing to go to protect her, its just so much more interesting than just 10 more episodes of her being doubted and 2 episodes of vindication",,self,,

 Brody is a completely broken man. I don't believe he is a ""bad"" guy. He is not a cold, and Carrie broke it down for him very logically and correctly. Does that mean I think he's completely trustworthy from here on out? No. Is he still potentially dangerous? Yes. Someone that scrambled emotionally and psychologically is unpredictable at best. I expect him to waffle back and forth for awhile. However, I don't believe he truly wants to be a ""terrorist"", and he certainly doesn't want to hurt innocent people. When he did try to leave Nazir, he was clubbed over the head and tied to a chair in a hotel room. He really had little choice but to do what Nazir wanted. Even if the Stockholm syndrome wasn't messing with his head, if he didn't do as he was told, he and his family would be killed. 

Now Carrie and the CIA have given him an option he didn't have before. There is a small sliver of light, but she most definitely broke through to him in that interrogation.  She weaved truth in there and used her feelings for him to reach him, and I believed it worked. That startled look on his face when she said ""I want you to leave your wife and kids and be with me"" was totally genuine. He may not know how he feels about Carrie yet, but I guarantee you that he felt calm, safe and a comforting solace up in that cabin that he hasn't felt in more than 8 years (certainly not with Jessica), and he will be craving that comfort again. Their love scenes were almost womb like, just like the fetal position assumes when Saul and Carrie try to help him up.

Am I the only Brody apologist out there?

(sorry forgot to add that to the title)


So this is my theory about Brody still being bad
There is the fact that him and Carrie suddenly get up and leave the ceremony, but Brody looks uncomfortable due to the praising Walden and we don't know that he wouldn't have left regardless, or that he wouldn't have gestured to Carrie. After all, we can tell after the first season and not blowing himself up that he does still value his life.  Later, he conveniently notices his car being moved right before the explosion...this part may be a stretch, as he has reason to be concerned about this.
 I think the main questions regarding this theory are why would he have pointed out the car

I'm going to run through the options, but anyway...) If we could get people choosing who they suspect as well, it'll be interesting to see who ends up being right. 

---

---

*Name who you suspect the most


---


---

**Carrie**

I'm only putting this on here because I saw a 'theory' on the AV Club that she has split personality and, there is 0% chance of this happening, primarily because she's the main character, but also because it's a stupid suggestion.

---
**Saul**

We've seen him fret about that rug, and conspicuously hand over all Walker-related operations to Carrie, all of which have gone wrong. He would also be aware that Galvez and Carrie were tailing Faizel and would know about the sting on Walker with the diplomat. In other words, he's in a position to have done everything the mole did...

...however, loves his work, and has no sympathy for those seeking to attack the US. It would be a frankly disgraceful betrayal of his character to reveal him as a mole for the sake of it.

In terms of the structure of the show going forward, and his back story is ripe for future conflicts and revelations. They won't waste his character on a twist as absurd as this.

---

**Estes**

Also probably in a position to have done everything the mole did, it could still be David seizing on the opportunity to silence the terrorist, but I suspect that the removal of someone who could betray his cover like that would be his top priority, when instead he was congratulating Saul and Carrie on their interrogation.

He's also a career man through and through, and has stuck with it because it brings him success and respect. I don't think it's him.

---

**Galvez**

The least developed of the CIA agents we've actually spent some time with. His reaction when Faizel was revealed to be the one they were after (having cleared him earlier) seemed one of genuine frustration, but he was in the car with Carrie as they tailed Faizel, and the call Eileen received about the tail sounded urgent, as if it had just come through. If the writers value internal logic, which for now let's assume they do, it's impossible for him to have alerted Eileen about the CIA tail.

---

**Vice President**

We're assuming that the mole works for Abu Nazir. If Nazir has the VP, getting Walker to assassinate both Brody and the VP to completely destroy US morale). The VP is clearly a snaky character and shrewd political operative, but I doubt he's working with Nazir. For one thing, it's a ridiculously big gambit for the first season of a show like this. He's only on here because Gaines has also been suggested, and I thought I might as well touch on him briefly.

---

**Gaines (his aide)**

Bleh. This would just be silly, Gaines probably has to come through unscathed. Like David, she seems far more concerned with the careers of those she works with than any silly terrorism plot, and there is actually zero evidence it could be her - it's just the old 24 suspicion making people suggest otherwise.

---

**Virgil**

Retired CIA agent who remains heavily involved in presumably classified operations (the raid on Faizel's house, when setting up surveillance equipment in Brody's house, he opted not to cover the garage. This should set off alarm bells, but he wasn't in a position to slip the terrorist the razor blade, nor would he necessarily have been aware of the tail on Faizel. I don't think it could be him, and for the same reasons...

---

**Max**

...I don't think it could be his brother, there was a line a few episodes back that sounded a bit clunky, where Virgil said of Max: ""sometimes, I don't know if he's half dumb, or just acting that way to piss me off"". Hm? But no, not very likely

---

**An un-named CIA agent**

This is definitely an option, but this is the route I hope (and suspect!) they'll go down. 

---

---

So

**Carrie**

**Saul**

Velenor

**Estes**

quinch

**Galvez**

**Vice President**

**Gaines (his aide)**

MoMoApostate

**Virgil**

**Max**

**An un-named CIA agent**

HEY HOMELANDERS! Sorry I was late setting up the official discussion but many props to mediocre_genius for setting up the unofficial thread in my absence. 

Last week Reddit was going down and up during the original 10pm EST airing which led to no upvotes showing up until the next day and just all around confusion when it came to discussion. 

Which resulted in last weeks discussions being a bunch of random observations and one line zingers since people weren't watching along in real time and discussing events and asking questions. Which really makes these discussions enjoyable to me and hopefully to you as well.

We have the unofficial up but I was curious to see if anyone would be interested in watching it again during the encore. Notice things you missed the first time around and  now that you've taking it all in

Brody is seeing his world with new eyes, Brody is now seeing Nazir not just as a father grieving for Issa, but as something more sinister. I've had a nagging feeling that Brody's love for and loss of Issa was orchestrated by Nazir, that it was all planned in order to emotionally manipulate him. I suspect Brody will come to discover that Nazir planned for Issa to die, and that Issa was not actually Nazir's son. With Brody wearing 'two hats' now, I wonder if he will use resources from both sides to his own ends, and enact his own plot for revenge against the people who have wronged him.

Anyways, and the fact that he got up and left with Carrie so he wouldn't be directly killed by the explosion was convenient.  Sure he could have been killed by the explosion in the office, but I bet that was a risk he was willing to take now that he basically handed off his family to Mike. We also have to remember that Abu Nazir was willing to sacrifice himself and many of his people to achieve his long term goals.  I believe that he purposely pointed out his car outside to Carrie to deflect suspicion from him if they survived (since she's always been the one who was right about him, she would tell Saul and everyone else that he wasn't responsible).

I refuse to believe in terrorists that take a publicly visible role, well that instantly pushes it into ""meh"" territory for me. Sure, great characters they have but what for? Now, implying that there is a mole *somewhere* in the CIA that is feeding terrorists data... sure, why not. Bradley Manning has shown us what is possible for an intelligence official with a USB stick and an internet connection. 

But a well-known journalist that converses with the head of the CIA while simultaneously being the cell leader for the number one enemy of the state? Yeah

That's why by now I force myself to believe in some kind of false-flag attack, raid the bomb maker's store. I don't know how that false-flag thing would work, I just tell myself that last season's plot really was coined by Abu Nazir but this season's plot is actually Walden in a long-con to get public and international support for attacking Iran. Somehow you could make it work and it's intriguing to think about it for a while. I mean they had a fucking fundraiser at a weapons manufacturer and Walden as a whole is basically characterized as a *darker* version of Dick Cheney by now. But if this is the plan,well then it's just plot holes from here on out, no matter how good they pull it off. Because if it comes down to it, the best way to do a false flag is eerily similar to all the thwarted FBI terror plots but thought through to the last step. Isolate susceptible individual, hand him *actual* bomb making stuff instead of fakes

What I'm saying is they stretched this thing too far either way. Last season we had two turned US soldiers, hell even three different sleeper cells - most of which didn't know shit about each other. It's certainly stretching belief but it still flies. Because it still operates in the basic framework of real Islamic terrorism. This time, it's a top journalist, a US congressman and a bunch of completely anonymous Arab black ops soldiers making up one big 24 style terror corporation.

Also, exploring at least to a tiny degree the complications of what the War on Terror actually is: a War of terror on Terror.

This year we have Dana in the school assembly opposing a war against Iran and two or three scenes with the Hamas wife in the first episode that constitute a down to Earth approach to what is *actually* happening in the world. Something that ties it to reality.

So whatever happens now

Hopefully the people running the show have a plan. Because I really don't want to see this go down the usual Showtime road that leads straight to the aforementioned ditch. I really really don't.

[Spoilers],totzov,7,1,5,"So I'm fresh after season 2 ending and I must admint I am impressed as hell by the quality of show. It literally made me say ""what the f..."" few times through most episodes and smiling to creators. They did brilliant job.

What I'm most interested in shows and movies are characters themselves and relationships between them. House, I've actually never seen this word used) people and after first episode I thought I already figured out who Carrie and Sauls were I see now how wrong I was. Carrie indeed is able to do a lot to get job done but she also has ""weaker"" side, she loves and wants to be loved while Saul isn't such a good old man as it seemed in the beggining and most of it doesn't look forced. I love it. I can't wait for third season to see how characters will develop, how whole show will.


But there's few things that are bothering me and i hope you will help me make things clear:

1. I think Carrie fell in love a little bit too fast in Brody. I really enjoyed this relationship but I felt like it happend in between two or three episodes.
2. Why didnt Walker shot Walden instead of Elizabeth and 1/2 SS men? I mean i know it was to made them all hide in one place so Brody could blow everyone but - he didn't do it and shooting vice president would end life of actually someone important without making it suspicious that such a good sniper missed.
3. I didn't have anything against Dana till i read somewhere here someones complaints about how she's so ""emo"" all the time and... i agreed. Now i think that it looked fine in the beggining but she stayed the same through full both season. I wish they will give her a reason to be happy next season.

And my prediction is that Brody isn't on Al-Qaeda side anymore, everything, including Carrie helping him to run away, too unbelievable.

Thanks for answering, please let me now.",,False,self,t5_2smlq,False,,

As to the first word, means ‘father of’ (which is why Palestinian President Mahmoud ‘Abbas is sometimes alternatively referred to as Abu Mazen, i.e. ‘Mazen’s father’). However, outside of the teknonymic formation, ‘Abu’ is sometimes used in order to refer to a unique personal (somatic, character, etc) attribute which has no special genealogical significance (as with the title of Egyptian intellectual Yaqub Sanu’s famous satirical magazine “Abu Nizara Shamsiyya”, or my personal handle
The second word, in colloquial pronunciation (which tends to be widely divergent at any rate), Arabic contains several different ‘z’ sounds (ز+ظ+ض+ذ). Without getting into too much wonky detail, I’ve decided that the form of ‘Nazir’ being discussed presently is نذير.  Here’s how the Hans Wehr Dictionary of Modern Written Arabic (for all intents and purposes the go-to lexicon) defines the word: “consecrated to God; vowed; solemnly pledged; warner; herald, harbinger, forerunner; warning; alarm.” 
Bearing all of this in mind, I just thought you all might like to know (other Arabic speakers are free to offer correctives to my interpretation). Cheers everybody. Happy viewing!

But in this season we find that Abu Nazir knows the combination to Estes's safe, and when it was clearly supposed to be Estes' call.

Yesterday I told my friend about Homeland and we watched the first episode together.  Below is every scene Estes is in.  Some parts of it may be nothing

(1) The prisoner who was in contact with Cary, but just as Cary was getting close to getting intel, the prisoner suddenly had his sentence changed.  Estes then tells Cary to not meet with the prisoner.

(2) Estes was the one who revealed to the CIA agents that Brody had been saved.  When Cary stood up to leave the room

(3) When Brody comes back to the US and meets Mike for the first time

(4) Estes cuts off Cary's line of questioning during the debriefing.  When Cary tells Brody to ""look again"" at the picture of Abu Nazir, saying ""well, apparently he didn't.""

(5) Estes asks Saul if it was Saul's choice or Cary's for Cary to be in the debriefing.  Saul says ""I'm surprised you didn't bring her in yourself

(6) More of Estes to Saul: ""She kept trying to connect Brody with Abu Nazir.  It's always Nazir with her!  What did I tell you when I agreed to give her one more chance?  I said it would end badly for both of you.""

It's hardly proof, and I can't think of a single time in the rest of the season when they've blatantly tried to hide it.  While we see some too-obvious clues for Saul (lie detector) and Galvez (I'm Muslim), Estes is just playing the dumb boss role and doing what's best for Abu Nazir time after time.

The questions Saul failed on the polygraph were along the lines of ""have you sold secrets to enemies? have you worked with enemies? yada yada blah?"".

&gt;What does Abu Nazir know from Carrie Mathison??? Perhaps in a future episode we will learn that in his interrogation last week Nicholas Brody talked about Carrie Mathison for hours and hours. Maybe when Nazir asked about his change of heart, Abu Nazir, not because I love my family, but because I have fallen in love with this loose cannon CIA agent — she really gets me! She likes having pounding sex on upright furniture and thinks it’s sweet when I curl up on the floor and have terror flashbacks! — and we are going to be together forever.” And maybe Nazir was like, “Tell me about this Carrie. What kind of car does she drive? And where does she live? And would you do anything for her? Oh, I only ask, because I would totally let you have your original corner of terror floor back, I am unclear on how Abu Nazir — who does not have, Brody’s phone was tapped until this episode
