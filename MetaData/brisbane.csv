I'm a 25y/o male and I live in the inner west of Brisbane by myself. I have a degree that I don't use, don't mind a few beers, and the odd tree. I work a regular 8 - 4 in the CBD, and own a car. I prefer a pub over clubs, but a occasional night out has it's place. I like your standard TV and movie selection, but that's a bit broad to elaborate on here, and tend to burn through stuff a season at a time.

So yeah. If anyone is in a similar spot, but that's ok, just think friends instead.

Straight of limb

They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted

They fell with their faces to the foe.

They shall grow not old

Age shall not weary them

At the going down of the sun and in the morning

We will remember them.

---

I hope you all have a wonderful day, going to the beach or having a feast. Days like this remind us of why Australia is a magnificent country. I attended the Dawn Service this morning, which was incredible. It was so great to see such a large crowd and to see all of the men and women in their uniforms. It seemed fitting that it was such a beautiful sunrise this morning, to conclude a beautiful ceremony. So if you can, spare a thought for the men who died at such places as Gallipoli and Villers-Bretonneux. Lest we forget. 

Edit: I've been watching Today's coverage of Anzac Day and there was a moment that really struck me. It was two veterans of Kokoda explaining their thoughts on war and facing the enemy. George, ""I don't hate the enemy. I think those who hate are always more unhappy than the hated."" Great words that I think we can all apply to our own lives. 

Isn't Anzac day such a good day for reflection? Cheers.",self,t5_2qutz,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/sqj4a/anzac_day_2012_lest_we_forget/

Since we're all off to the polls this weekend I thought I'd post a little something about how our preferential voting system works. I've come across many people who, you can stop reading now. Your vote will be counted exactly as you think it will be. Too easy!

---

**Point 1: You should ALWAYS vote for the party you actually want to vote for**

&gt; If I vote for a party like The Sex Party or (god forbid) The Shooter's Party

** Voting 1 for your favourite party makes them money**. If they exceed a certain percentage of the vote (I believe 4% in Qld state elections)

A less concrete effect is to send a message to the major parties that you support the message of your minor party of choice.

As for your vote ""just going to Labor or Liberal"", 2 Liberal. Your vote will not help the ALP *in the slightest*. You normally vote LNP, but think Bob Katter might the go? Vote 1 Bob, 2 LNP. Your vote will not help the ALP *in the slightest*. Your mate Robbo is running as an independent, you want to help him but you'd really rather just vote Labor? Vote 1 Robbo, 2 Labor. Your vote will not go to Campbell Newman, not one little bit.

**Point 2: Voting for a third party will NEVER help your least favourite major party

---

Now, the candidate with the lowest vote is eliminated. Each ballot paper that had the eliminated candidate down as number 1 is then inspected, and that vote is transferred **(at full value)** to the candidate with a number 2 next to their name. Then the process begins again - if a candidate has more than 50% of the combined number 1 and transferred votes, they win. If not, the candidate with the next lowest votes is eliminated, their ballot papers inspected and votes transferred to the candidate with number 2 next to their name. If the number 2 candidate has previously been eliminated, the vote is transferred to the number 3 candidate, at which point that candidate is declared the winner. 

**Point 3: In practise what this means is that if you vote for a minor party

This is not a built-in feature of the system, vote 1 Green, 2 Liberal. Your vote will earn the Greens a dollar, but will ultimately be transferred *at full value* to the Liberal party. You like Labor but like the Sex Party more? Vote 1 Sex, 2 Labor. A dollar for the Sex Party, a full value vote transferred to Labor.

---

**Point 4: It is still possible for third party candidates to be elected to parliament!**

If a Greens or Katter Party or whoever candidate can get 50%+ of the primary and transferred votes, and all the 1 Liberal votes were transferred to other candidates. Enough of these votes were transferred to Adam Bandt for him to get 50%+ of the vote and win the seat. That's right, **Adam Bandt of the Greens was elected thanks to Liberal Party preferences**. 

---

**Point 5: In Qld state elections

If you're so disgusted with both major parties that the thought of your vote being transferred to them makes you recoil in horror, your vote will ""expire"" - that is, it will not be transferred. In practice though this can have unintended consequences. Lets say that in some electorate, the LNP get 40%, Labor get 35% and the Greens get 25%. If every single one of those Greens voters did not give a preference, all 25% of those votes would expire, leaving the Labor and LNP candidates as the last two standing. Because the LNP got the most votes of the two final candidates, despite having 60% of the people in that seat vote against them.

One of you had encouraged me to share some other reviews of things I've eaten which I have enjoyed, to share your favourites as well.

*A note about my credibility as a foodie: I weigh 100 kilos. Is that credible enough for you?*

Anyway

**Breakfast Stuff**

I'm not an eggs guy, so take that into account on this list

* Bagel Boys bagels (onion and garlic flavours, but have been known to use the panini press in my office's kitchen to flatten them out a little bit to enhance the chewiness. I should note that good bagels should be chewy, and the Bagel Boys are as good as it gets here in Qld. 

* Kabana and cheese with BBQ sauce on a day-old sesame bun - I get these from this takeaway on the corner of Mary and Edward in the CBD (on Mary, for some reason. I even like how the day-old roll's semi-stale texture works for this sandwich.

* Volcanos - Got these takeaway from Jocelyn's Provisions on James Street. They're a roll topped with baked Swiss cheese, but I'm betting I won't care at all.

**Lunch In The CBD**

* My favourite is the chicken karaage (kaarage?) bento box from Nagomi at Eagle Street Pier. Fried chicken, edamame, salad, croquettes. All of it tasty, and usually no more than a three minute wait from ordering.

* Jia Jiang noodles - Fantasia (Macarthur Central, too.

* Little Saigon's Banh Mi - they call them ""baguettes"" on the menu, carrot, cucumber and coriander represent the vegetable. I usually get chili on it too, along with the Vietnamese-style BBQ sauce. All of this on a crusty French roll. Banh mi sandwiches are the best. There's a new place in a laneway between Charlotte and Queen just north of Post Office Square called ""The Roll"" which is doing these as well. I had one yesterday and it was good.

**Other Stuff**

* Sundays at Yardbird Ale House in the Valley they do ""Sunday Crafternoons, and probably the closest thing to an American pub-style burger I've had in a long time (thick patty, all beef with no filler - Grill'd and Burger Urge are very much an Aussie-style burger you don't see in the US, and BYOB in Newstead isn't at all as good as Yardbird's). I also recommend the steak sandwich off the regular Yardbird menu. It's got a caramelized onion relish on it that's juicy like gravy and makes the whole damn thing delicious (not to mention the steak itself is thick enough to actually represent some pink inside, which was nice).

* Bitter Suite in New Farm (I like craft beer) has these beef cheek gravy chips with gruyere cheese melted over top that I really

* Pork buns from the guy at Jan Power Powerhouse markets who sets up next to Bagel Boys - holy crap. These things have a juicy

* Pho at West End Gardens in West End - if you've not had pho, The Vietnamese, PhoB, that upscale Vietnamese joint across from PhoB, and at that place by The Vietnamese in the Valley whose name is escaping me - Hoang Gia?). So very delicious, and perfect for wintertime.

WHAT SAY YOU REST OF R/BRISBANE?

**edit: Little Saigon is in Rowe's Arcade off Edward/Adelaide**

**edit2: voice of the people suggests:**

*Cyber City in the Valley - Chinese takeaway, dart boards and shit

*West End Markets - Langos &amp; Lepeny stall on Saturdays

*Maru on Elizabeth St

*Popolo's in Southbank - Italian

*Cafe Meze - West End

*The Thai joint near UQ on Hawken that's purple

*Pho Pasteur - Market Square in Sunnybank

*Quanh Thanh - Hardgrave Rd for Vietnamese/Chinese

*Sakura - Gladstone Rd in Highgate Hill for Japanese

*Sushi Kotobuki - East Brisbane (cnr Shafston Ave and Latrobe St)

*Punjabi Palace - South Brisbane/West End

*Tasty BBQ - Sunnybank

*Prawn wonton noodle soup - FantAsia (Macarthur

*$10 pizza Tuesdays - Yardbird Ale House in the Valley

*Spreadable pork sausage (chorizo sobrasada) - Salumi Australia sold at Sourced Grocer

*Guzman y Gomez burritos (Wintergarden

*Cocktails at Lychee Lounge (West End) - Specifically ""Opium No. 2""

*Cocktails at SuperWhatnot, Lock-n-Load, Glass

*Ribs at Ribbets and Plough Inn

*Curry at Kumas in Coopers Plains

*American-style BBQ (smoked meat) at Smoke in Merthyr Village

Is anyone in a position to AND interested in adopting a kitty cat? This poor fellow - http://imgur.com/NBV9x -, yowling (mating calls) all night and upsetting our cats quite a bit with a few encounters through the screen doors and spraying all around our house. He was probably dumped or abandoned. We eventually caught him last night and my partner who is a Vet has taken him to work today and she has confirmed he has no microchip and is giving him a few health checks (FIV test etc). Being male and not a kitten, not many shelters would be interested in him, and those that would be are full. He is actually quite friendly, cute and affectionate, and would probably make a nice pet once de-sexed and receiving some proper care. We can probably organise de-sexing if we can find him a new home. Note: His sore nose is from injuring it on the cat carrier he had to live inside last night. 

Let me know if you think you can help or know someone who might be able to!

**UPDATE!** My partner de-sexed him today and has tested negative to FIV. We will also vaccinate him when we find him a home. ",self,t5_2qutz,1352202627.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/brisbane/comments/12pr5a/found_a_cat_needs_a_home/

Brisbane city rates notices have just come out. 

I'm on my 2nd home now but last rates notice I sat down to pay a stack of bills via internet banking. I was working thru them pretty quickly so I grabbed the rates notice and paid the green amount.

It was only a week later that I looked again (not in such a rush) and saw that I had donated $15 to the city hall reconstruction. 

That is most definitely not something that I wish my charity money to go towards.  I never go into the city

I rang up and reversed the 'contribution' and have just received my money back. (3 months later)

House was broken into

Edit- Car found!!!! On winstanley st near the bulimba creek bridge! Will update later once I speak to cops.  

Second Edit - Tuesday Night -
Apologies for hiding the post - I didn't want it cramming up the front page. Here's the story:
I was at work in the city an got a call from my parents that our house had been broken into in Carindale. They had only arrived home shortly before so didn't have time to take inventory. My personal car was missing out of the garage though.
On my bus road home from work at 5:30pm, it's probably one of the busiest roads in the suburb after Old Celeveland). I jumped off the bus immediately (forgot to swipe the go-card, d'oh) and waited with my car while my parents brought down the spare keys, and a pair of latex gloves the police (now at the house) had given them. The car was locked, and the keys were gone. It makes absolutely 0 sense for them to park where they did in such plain sight, unless they wanted the car to be found.
The car drove just fine back home - no dents or anything, except for the seat being moved back and the radio turned off, totally untouched.
Of the things stolen from the house, expensive looking watches and most jewelry. The strangest thing they stole was a dustbuster, along with charger??
So glad to have my car back

I sat at the stop a good 10 minutes as I watched 3-4 buses pull up and then leave before I realised that there would be no service provided to me whatsoever.  So I contacted a cab company to come and pick me up

We are a bunch of Engineering students at QUT who have built a 3D Printer for one of our projects and now would like to bring our service to anyone in Brisbane.

We provide a Rapid Prototyping service offering a cheap alternative to many professionals with design services also on offer.

Our print resolutions are capable of up to .05mm to .025mm in the Z axis

Pricing are 10c per gram of material, this is not something to 'pay the rent'. 
An example print might be the 180mm tall Venus de Milo statue replica I have printed for many people

I will do anything. If I can't do it I'll bring a friend who knows how (know a lot of tradesman willing to help me through this) - I will be honest with you if that is the case.

I'd also value any insights people have in how I can market myself with this. This won't be something I'll do forever so I don't have much incentive to invest any capital (nor anything to really invest) but until mum has sorted the legal side of this horrible mess out I need to give her everything I can.

**Breakfast** - I almost always stop for a bagel (onion or garlic, which is near the back on the main aisle down the middle. They've got a few sandwiches they put together too, but I'm pretty simple in my bagel selection. I would add that if you take away a few garlic bagels you can make mini pizzas during the week that taste just damn delicious. Toast the bagel with some butter first, then add your sauce and cheese and bake.

In addition to Bagel Boys, which is a nice change of pace from the BBQ pork featured in most other meatballs. Their dumplings are terrific, too. Dave and his business partner (I forget his name) are good guys who are succeeding in putting out a consistently excellent product, even if it ultimately means focusing on doing just a few things really well (three varieties of dumplings and a pork bun - that's their menu).

**Lunch** - While I visit Steamed from time to time for lunch instead of breakfast, the banh mi at the Vietnamese at the top of the escalators in Myer Center by the bottle-o is $5, theirs is $9), but the quality is excellent. Tell Jeannine and Jeannette (why their mom named lookalike sisters like this is beyond me, but one or both will be there) that the American guy Anthony sent you. Good people, good product.

Kate's Vegetarian stand (I think it's Kate's) has good product too. Bean or lentil salads, and I'll pick up some stuff from them as a change of pace from my banh mi. Added bonus: there's a really attractive six foot tall woman who has that nerdy girl look like the actress Judy Greer from Arrested Development who works there. She's married, but still.

Cornish Pasty Man does nice work. I like the original with some hot sauce (chili sauce of the Mexican variety) on it

Everyone knows about German Sausage Hut

THIS WEEK FRIDAY IS **GOOD FRIDAY**


Good Friday is the one day of the year when things open '364 days a year' will be shut.

If you are going to a party or a BBQ over the weekend, THINGS WILL BE SHUT.

Petrol is going to be more expensive.  If money is tight

Buy your alcohol and sausages on THURSDAY because trying to do it on Friday will be a fruitless exercise.  You'll be able to get bacon and eggs at crazy prices from 7-11s and corner shops but that's about it.

If you live in the central area

If you buy drugs

A few very quick tips:

* Going to the airport from any station? Buy a new GoCard

* Travelling more than 3 zones on a single one way bus trip (no connections)?. Tagging off actually will charge you more than ""forgetting"" to tag off. Warning though: This is technically fare evasion

* Forgot to scan off and are overcharged? Ring 13 12 30. They'll generally refund the first few times you forget.

There are lots and lots of bats! You can see me making a face as tons of bats whirl around us. Also there's a fair amount of graffiti! Some of it's quite good. Every now and then there is a shaft leading up to a manhole where we can hear the noises of people going about their day haha.

I'll post some of the funny/poignant responses to some of the free text field answers later if there's interest

Edit the first: 

**Any final comments on /r/brisbane?**


* A subreddit for tourists. I'm getting sick of the almost daily ""I'm coming to Brisbane

* Less meetup crap.. if I want to meet people I go outside.


* It's fairly quiet

* tis a silly place

* Less Mana Bar stuff.  The place is shithouse.

* It's awesome. Wouldn't mind more meet ups.

*Less meetups...more meetups.....*

* ""Where to begin, probably not after the first little rant but mabe. If you are reading this HELLO and god bless.
Ha no

*We value your input citizen*

* We need moar content! It's cool that it's not overly busy but I'd like a little bit more going on over in Brisvegas ;)

* Might be nice for someone to do a post for the new year about the meet ups and what happens. I have always seen people organising them and it seems everyone who goes knows each other. I have always been too shy to go because I am not sure if I would be welcomed

*Less cronyism is always good.*

* More moderators

*Your job not mine &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232; The content that is. Just kidding - I'm the sockpuppet for all [/r/brisbane](/r/brisbane) accounts*

* Wharrgarbl. 

*Agreed!*

* I enjoy the subreddit but would like to see it more active

* Not enough alphabeat nudes.

*No can do. Nevernude*

* Hats. More hats.

* Please

* Got a friend living in Marrumba Downs and should be visiting within the year. Can't wait to get the Brizzy. The subreddit is brilliant for keeping me up to date with what's going on in the city. Maybe more news stuff and less rental opportunities and garage sales...

* too cliquey and not open to counter points of view. If you're not a left wing unwashed uni student you don't count.

* There's nothing really to say about the content, doesn't interest me, and many of the folks commenting and submitting don't strike me as people I would ever want to know or speak to regularly. At least some of what goes up is helpful to other people though.

* Yeah it sucks. Just goes to prove how many dumbasses believe in ghosts. I'm just waiting for drunken naked twister with asian hipster chicks meetup.

* meets that don't revolve around alcohol would be good

* fukken sik1 m8

*Verily*

* I want more Gold Coasters to know there's a sub-reddit for them. I'm actually living on the Gold Coast (even though most my weekends are spend in Brisvegas, you're 80 clicks away!

* More crazy house party meet ups 

* We need more meet-ups!

* Moerators rock. Especially that PorConflict guy

*Nice try

* You guys are so nice :)

* its way better than the fanatical politicism of r/australia

* ""The moderators are super-awesome. All of them.

* -- not a moderator. *

* Honest.

* No.

* It seems like a pretty chill place and ads are never intrusive at all. I don't think there needs to be forced tags or other cumbersome rules and it'll probably be a pain the arse for you to have to enforce for a post once in a blue moon. 

* O pointy birds, anointy-nointy. 

http://i.imgur.com/XJyGY.gif


*Last but not least*

* Before I begin, the Mana Bar is not a redditor. It should still be allowed to advertise, but this comment is reflective of my personal distaste for the place (it was meant to be some sort of alcoholic gaming utopia, and all it did was break my heart with its mediocrity; I tried, I really did). Actually, while we're on the topic I guess I am a little pissed off that all the meetups keep having to start or end at the Mana Bar... fuck that shit. NYE: Mana Bar. Again, it's not that great and it really isn't the proper place for discussion (be it silly, though... I've said it before, and I hope never to be in the same room as him again. Some people are just not fun to be around. Apologies if I am sounding like a bit of a cunt (well

* As for the moderators, and that's your collective attitude towards Grandmaster Watermelon (you may know him better as LawrenceWatermelon or VinDieselwithhair) are honestly ridiculous. There's a downvote system for a reason, and a lot of his more recent accounts (that you still banned) had plenty of upvoted posts where he's said something funny or insightful. There will be some occasions where he posts something inflammatory or ridiculous, but that's what downvotes are for. Robert_Houdin, kitzorz, Kreacher and myself have all had the pleasure of meeting him. The good news for you is that he has no intention of coming back anymore. You ought to be ashamed of yourselves. I just hope you have the sense not to send out a banning lynch mob the next time we get someone even remotely as funny as Papa Watermelon partaking in /r/brisbane.

I bring up Google Maps, I also notice we have a stop-by-stop indication of where we're currently at.

This feature, for once, that I knew precisely where to go, where to get off; that's something I've never felt on Translink services, even on my most well-known routes. I feel a massive need for this feature, both for tourists, and those of us who need to go on routes off the beaten track.

So I ask, I've yet to see any action taken by the new government. What's the situation here, and is there any ETA for it to roll out?

My parent's house was broken into last night - Arana Hills suburb. 

Mum's car and mobile phone were stolen. She has just got back from her mother's funeral and after a sh|te day locked the house up but left her phone and keys on the bench in the kitchen area. Apparently the burglar jimmied a lock and then exited via front door (going by the kitchen on the way and grabbing what was in sight):(

The phone had a pin on it but she also contact her phone provided and know it hasn't been used

This brings me no small amount of joy. So, peered into the shop, and still couldn't figure out what the hell a cheesesteak was.

Please

At its most basic,"" is a chopped steak sandwich with cheese and onion on a soft French roll. For authenticity purposes, the cheese should be either provolone (PJ's has it) or [Cheez Wiz](http://www.kraftbrands.com/cheezwhiz/) (PJ's doesn't have this - cheddar/American other lesser cheese options), which is not the same as ""Easy Cheese,"" the cheese you shoot out of a can. 

Having lived near Philadelphia for awhile (and in Chicago, and therefore need to make you aware that this place exists, and you should be eating there.

The cheesesteak itself starts with thinly sliced raw ribeye, with the cheese melted over top then tossed in as well. It turns the whole thing into a cheesey beefy sludge that tastes delicious. If you go, you can opt for mushroom, capsicum and/or jalapeno to be tossed in as it cooks, or can go for a ""cheesesteak hoagie,"" which simply adds lettuce and tomato cold to the top of the sandwich.

Pro tip: absolutely go for double cheese (provolone)

Huge bonus here too is that the fries are good and the onion rings are OUTSTANDING. Probably the best rings I've had in years. None of that slimy inside stuff where the onion slips out of the casing. Instead, and they hit it with both salt and pepper so it definitely pops.

Oh

Again, precious cheesesteaks remains an ongoing option.

Got myself a nice letter in the mail from Origin today about tariff's going up for power from July 11.

Quick notes on this for people;

* 12.14% increase in Tariff 11 (Normal Residential)

* 55.64% increase in ""Service to your property"" (now 64.9c/day)

* 35.57% increase in Tariff 11 (Night Economy)

* 33.03% increase in Tariff 33 (Controlled Supply


So the bill for my house at least are going to go up from $518 for a quarter to $650

I've got a spreadsheet with it all done up and some calculators

Beyond that though, down with labor, up with Can-Do, side ways with Barnaby etc, BUT at the end of the day, this kind of ""increase"" is absurd, if I was told my Internet/Rego/Food/etc was going up by 20% across the board, as it will countless others across QLD.


I've just been reading up on some figures for profit from origin too (http://www.originenergy.com.au/files/Origin_HY2012_Results_Presentation.pdf)
They claim profit of $489m December 11, that then provides them with ~670m profit, who knows how well they will end up doing out of charging me, a normal consumer an extra 20% on my power bill.

It's shaping up to be a [very tight election](http://blogs.crikey.com.au/pollbludger), and held by the Liberals by *1.1%* in the 2010 election.

My point is this: If you really give a shit about issues like the NBN, and just not having pointless austerity - even if Labor are just a less shit choice than the Coalition - you might actually be able to have an impact this time around. *Last election the informal vote was higher than the 2PP vote difference in Brisbane.*

So my advice is to get out there and [volunteer for the ALP](http://www.queenslandlabor.org/volunteer-sign-up/) in the Division of Brisbane, get them to enrol to vote, share your ideas, whatever. If you feel you might look like a tool doing it, ask yourself: *is that more important than the political and social issues that affect us?*

**Edit**: While this is a blatantly partisan post

Also: [*make sure you're enrolled to vote!!!*](http://www.aec.gov.au/)

  Little bit of background before I get to my point....

  I suppose I'm going through a few changes at the moment. Lot's of big questions about life, or just buy a house and start a family. I've been working really hard lately to get my shit together, but the road to success just keeps knocking me down. Perhaps I expect too much from myself. All I know is it's starting to take a toll on my overall happiness. 

I no longer share any of the same interests as those who I grew up with. So I've grown away from the friends I went to highschool with. They've all settled in and have decided to stop learning new things

I'm a very creative person

I have a lot of time on my hands as I work for myself teaching guitar and music theory. It doesn't pay well but I earn plenty for what I need. Growing up I wanted to be a professional musician, perhaps even maybe doing some session work. I didn't think it was too much to ask but finding people in Brisbane who would be dedicated to such an unreliable line of work has proven to be quite difficult. 

So instead, there's only so far one person can go.

This is where I'm at now..
Asking redditors of Brisbane this question. 
Are there any people around feeling as lost as I am, who would like to, go to gigs, dinners, pubs, and work on projects together. I would love to see a whole bunch of us sitting around having a few drinks and brainstorming ideas. Whether it be a new game, mobile app, tv show or charity. 

I know it's a long shot. So at the moment I will take anything that will get me out of the house

It's long I know
Thanks for reading.

She told me to do interval training on the machines and its so much more fun!
