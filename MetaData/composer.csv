As r/composer continues to grow I would like to write up an update

**The purpose, memes or content where related reddits are much better suited. It seems people are pleased with this level of niche, so the rules have been unchanged since our inception, save for some rephrasing.

**We’ve passed a thousand** original works posted, and art music music would be hard to find. This is the reason some posts (e.g. singer-songwriter/guitar and voice) are removed though they comply with the rules.

**If a self-post is** made with a relevant question about music then I usually let it stay until it is properly answered or until a day has passed before I take it down.

**Now
We’ve had a few successful composition competitions

**Prizes! I’ve been** told that reddit Gold is pretty sweet

**As always we appreciate your feedback.** And we appreciate any ideas or improvements

Thanks for reading.

Instrumentation is:
-2 Flutes
-2 Oboes
-2 Clarinets
-1 Horn in F
-1 Bassoon
-1 Bass Clarinet
-1 Contrabass

In total, one piece for electric cello (w/ looping), and one piece for clarinet (w/ looping). That's pretty cool. I mean, two pieces with looping!? I think that's pretty awesome.

This piece was my first attempt at exploring indeterminte and aleatoric procedures in my music. The piece is in 5 movements with each one containing 9 to 11 phrases that the player is to combine in any way they wish live. The length of the phrases decreases as time progresses starting with 5 measures of 4/4 in the first movement and ending with one measure of 9/8 by the last. Each movement is a set of pitches that if played in a row on the piano make up a complex chord progression.

Lust turned out to be my favourite piece of the lot. The scene is from Shame (2011). I didn't want to approach it like it was a 70's porno with wah-guitar and a load of brass. Instead I used mainly piano, being caught in the moment I guess, that resembles a deep passion that two strangers are feeling. 

I think I was most happy with the kind of innocence it has. I felt that even though you eventually find out that the two characters acting on their lust would be wrong

I think it's pretty rock and roll.

But what I mostly want to talk about, easy to read score is so very very important!* Even little errors in your scores and parts can take up precious rehearsal time, which you may or may not know can sometimes be in extraordinarily short supply, and every second counts toward getting a good performance. It's important to write down exactly what you want to hear in the most straightforward and neat way to make performers like reading your music... you'll be much more pleased with your performances that way, and having clean, easy to read scores is the most crucial step.

...on that note, pardon my French, *friggin' wacky*, so having him work over your scores will make performers very happy (and you ALWAYS want to make them happy!) If you think you could use his services, drop him a line, he even gave me a great deal. I know this is a bit of a shameless plug, but seriously

I'd be open to playing original pieces if they are a good fit for us.  I'd be happy to send you a recording of your work in exchange for permission to play it publicly.  Our next concert is in September.

I'm sort of at a composer's block with this piece. I'm having trouble segueing into my 2nd episode from the middle entry. I was looking at the Bach inventions and trying to gain inspiration from them. When he was going into his second episode, inversion, retrogression, but nothing seems to work. Does anyone have any specific tips on how I should continue? Where from my piece I can take from?

If the start is too slow and you feel bored

- I'd really like some feedback on the piece in general - what genre would you put it in? Should I replace chords with broken ones

- I'm having difficulty composing the violin part. I've been playing violin since i was 9 but i've been playing piano since i was 4 and piano comes more naturally to me


I do have a very unfinished score which has bits of my violin part in it too. If you want to see that i will add a link.

I'm not quite familiar with the conventions of the period, other than it is generally regarded as being more harmonically colorful than previous eras. For myself, this means fun and frequent modulations, however slight, as well as a substitution here or there. I have not thoroughly studied past classical-era tonic/dominant relationships, and as a result, any recommendations for texts on the analysis of various forms and conventions throughout history (a la The Shaping of Musical Elements Vol II) would be greatly appreciated.

Composed this for the new Man of Steel movie. I tried to channel a bit of Zimmer by composing what I felt I saw through the trailer. The beginning of the theme you have a militaristic feel introducing Superman's boldness and heroism. The flute theme right after represents Clark as a young boy and his innocence. The main theme then presents itself in solemn fashion to represent his internal struggles to find his true destiny. As the theme picks up momentum

I am using EastWest Composers collection as well as Hollywood Strings to achieve these sounds.  Great VST's if anyone is interested!

For my final piece I wrote a choral piece that moves through the various periods of western music, to a composition in ""reduced"", shall we say, sonata allegro form for classical, then a section in the best I could do with the romantic period (this was, in my opinion, the weakest section). Then I have a bit of impressionist style gliding chords and such and take a dissonant stop in the early 20th century with Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique before wrapping it up with a contemporary style section.

I'd love to hear what you guys think. I think it's a nice piece, this was meant to be sung a capella, but I didn't finish in time for our school's choir to learn it, so I made do with Finale's midi playback.

My name is William, to Grade 9 in the US, and Year 9 in Australia) who has recently composed a small piano piece for my music class. Just before I elaborate on myself and this piece's origins, I should make it clear that I'm only up to Grade 6 in theory :/

Fond of Classical and Romantic music, this piece sounds out of place to my tastes. It's a work of experimentation, composed by ear and meddling, rather than genuine masterful vision. It's also my first 'complete' work on Sibelius (I've composed several small pieces in the past, but nothing as comprehensive as this).

The composition's rhythm inspired mostly by a piece from the video-game Bioshock; ""Cohen's Masterpiece"", to 2 and then 3 however, comes from both Beethoven's Moonlight sonata (in part), and Chopin's Posthumous Op. 66 (The Fantasie Impromptu, whose 2:3 rhythm had some minor implementation during a few bars in the first movement).
I apologize for my lack of concision here (It's a well noted fault of mine!)


I'm requesting

**TL;DR:** I'm a 2nd year High School student. I wrote my first complete piece of music for the piano a week ago. Please listen and give feedback.

MIDI - http://www.mediafire.com/?qij2l59lcc9e6n9
PDF - http://www.mediafire.com/?9ry2oxa30040r2g
(Both files are very small)


**Also note:** I'm aware of the notation's currently messy nature. Dynamics aren't too apparent, and notes/lines all-too-often overlap. And yes, Sibelius seems to require (perhaps as a result of my inadequacy) two pedal lines, something I'm hardly retaining if I submit this for NCEA credit! Finally, I apologize for the page-width long bars :(",,False,t5_2sjib,True

I have had an idea going in my head for a while now

I have decided to write twelve motifs

The concept is that you will be able to begin on whatever song in the project that you want and it will go slowly in a circle all the time. Twelve songs, giving you the four seasons. I know that the concept of seasons and circular structure isn't new, but it's an interesting topic to me. It will focus on the natural aspect of the seasons, and not the human aspect. 

The songs will then be grouped into Spring

I will be posting pictures of the sheet music with the motifs and directions.

-At C

-The tam-tam in the first percussion part never plays back (happens twice

-The MIDI doesn't really know how to play sul pont. in the strings at P.

2. This piece is from a scene in-which one of the characters is being evicted. This piece was also not used in the final cut of the film (Orchestral): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/eviction

3. This is the second to the last scene of the movie (This one is a more conventional instrumentation of mandolin, the harp is from the Xpand2 virtual instrument): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/cw-empowering-flowers

4. This is the ending of the movie (Mostly Orchestral): https://soundcloud.com/healtone/cw-last-scene

Bonus: Here's a short film I did the music to right after working on the above movie: http://vimeo.com/40595463

Thanks for listening if you listened. And

(Note: I used Pro-Tools and Xpand2 to record all of the above. I used the volume slider on my keyboard controller incessantly for all the string sections, I'm a novice cellist and I noticed that if I added just a single cello track to the ""fake"" orchestra it added enough variance of pitch and bowing to make it sound more like a real orchestra.)",,False,self,t5_2sjib,1362067372.0,,

I'm a music student studying Classical composition. I've also been playing piano my whole life. Like any composer I'm trying to find my own style.

So far my style is represented best by the third phrase with the unusual rhythm. It's contemporary Romanticism. I love the Romantic Era the most.

The entire piece is 5/4 in d minor.

Hope you enjoy it.

I completed this piece while attending an Oberlin Conservatory composition workshop last summer (I'll actually be starting my first year of college there in a month). Since then it has seen many revisions and brought me a fair amount of success in competitions and performances. The recording isn't perfect but I feel the ideas are expressed well enough to achieve the desired effect. The 7"" and 4"" pauses at the end of the piece aren't honored in the recording but are made present in performances.

In the last 6 months I've started getting into music and recently started working on some counterpoint/harmony/introduction to composition. I am working towards becoming a mental health professional and would like to include composition as a tool for telling people's personal stories.

This is a piece I am working on for my Mom's wedding in October. I wanted to capture happy dance feeling of a waltz but also include a sad section that speaks to inevitable struggles and the need to work together to overcome them. I am happy with how this sounds as of right now but I was hoping to extend it to being at least 3 minutes. My problem is I don't know how to do that in a way that it will still be interesting harmonically

Do you guys have any comments on how I can lengthen this and still have it be interesting?

Part of a series of video-game style compositions. The idea of this piece is that the listener is suppose to be constantly getting lost, it does not really have an end - it gets to the end and repeats infinitely, as is with much video game music. The last bar is only there for the purpose of performance - hopefully this will get performed at a concert in a bit over a month.
