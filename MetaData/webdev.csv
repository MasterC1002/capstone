So here's my deal:

Got fired from my job as a construction project manager 18 months ago. decided to pivot my career and started sort of teaching myself to build websites. I'm a 38 year old white guy. Shocking

It's because of [this](http://reddit.com/r/webdev) subreddit

Last Friday I had my very first interview in this industry with a fairly large digital agency in a major us metropolitan area, which I promptly signed and returned, lest they change their mind...

So I start Monday. I'm pretty stoked. And pretty scared

I just think that it's so cool that I was able to learn enough about getting a job on the internet to get a job making the internet. ON. THE. INTERNET.

So thanks

I'd ask for tips or advice

(I created a throwaway account because I don't want to fuck this up somehow. Stranger things have happened

EDIT: 

Thanks for all the kind words

For brevity's sake

*tl:dr - learn the modern technologies, and be able to talk about it.*

* I started out not specifically trying to Learn How To Be A Web Developer. I started by trying to build a website at ""myfirstandlastname.com"" to put my resume on and get another job as a construction engineer. I think that was helpful in giving me an impetus to learn. I quickly realized I had no idea what I was doing

* When I finally decided that I needed to more actively do some of the learnings, I think. I didn't really *learn* python, really, but it introduced me to the importance of precision. It was essentially just typing things straight from the lessons, but in hindsight the repetition was useful to get my brain thinking in a different way.

* I then spent probably 7-8 months wandering around on the internet reading and learning everything I could about how the web worked. I did tons of tutorials, I kept trying different things until I could. I read tons of stuff on Stack Overflow, often just because I found it interesting. I listened to podcasts. I tried Ruby, and Rails. I did Node.js tutorials. (The NodeUp podcast is really good, btw). I learned how to use the command line. I learned how to use Vim. It just all started to intertwine into one thing, really.

* This spring, and maybe getting like, a JOB. 

* I built a portfolio site that looked pretty good. super simple, linked them to my portfolio. I cleaned up the blog I made for my kid using Octopress and used that on my portfolio. I made a nice resume, highlighting myself as a 'dedicated self-learner' with a passion for modern software development who had previously succeeded in a professional setting as a construction engineer. I put everything on Dice, and started getting contacted by recruiters pretty quickly. I got pretty lucky, I think. Found a recruiter (he found me, actually) who got me an interview pretty quick, and now here we go.

I probably should start writing about this experience. There's a lot of stuff,False,self,t5_2qs0q,1350668618.0,,,t3_11pbj1

Not just taken influence from it, and put it up on their own domain.  'Their' CSS and JavaScript even still contains my original copyright notice and email address at the top.

I've already gone through the motions of contacting them (no reply) and putting  a notice in with Google (no longer listed in their search results).

What I've realised

At the moment I'm rewriting this request through a PHP file which spits out a random line of jQuery from an array.  These do anything from redirecting the page request to random YouTube videos

So

**tl;dr:** give me your best website-screw-up one-line pieces of JavaScript!



**UPDATE:**
I want to thank everybody for your dastardly ideas and damning pieces of code

One comment here in particular struck me though

They work in a very similar field to me (albeit in a totally different country)




**UPDATE 2:**
It's all over folks!  The website owner finally got back in touch and admitted to ignoring me for the past several days.  They were pretty angry that I had Tweeted at a couple of their clients asking them if they could confirm contact details

The website is nolonger up and I've had confirmation from them that they won't repost it.  if they do

Thanks for all the brilliant ideas

1359860377.0,17sdbn,"Darkstrap.css, a dark theme for Twitter Bootstrap v2.2. (Update: Sucks less!)",danneu,181,25,http://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/comments/17sdbn/darkstrapcss_a_dark_theme_for_twitter_bootstrap/

* Demo: [Darkstrap vs Bootstrap](http://danneu.com/bag/darkstrap/darkstrap.html)
* Github: https://github.com/danneu/darkstrap

It turns the lights out on the default Twitter Bootstrap theme.

Just load `darkstrap.css` after your `bootstrap.css`. It's just an override.

    &lt;head&gt;
      &lt;link href='stylesheets/bootstrap.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;
      &lt;link href='stylesheets/darkstrap.css' rel='stylesheet' /&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;

### Why?

I got tired of wearing sunglasses while making my menagerie of cookie-cutter Bootstrap sites. I'm sort of a troglodyte.

### Didn't you post it here before?

Yeah

### What's new?

Over the course of a few Sideproject Saturdays

It basically sucks less

### ""Darkstrap"" sounds erotic.

I didn't even notice that until I googled the name to see if anybody had mentioned my theme in the *blogosphere* and stumbled upon some erotic literature. It wasn't very good

### I hope you like it.

I'm not much of a designer and I've only tested it on OSX with my eyes. 

I'm open to input and I'd love to hear if the contrast sucks or if I went overboard.

Or if you're someone with taste and have an opinion. 
Or if it's broken.

Or if you want to kill it with fire.

Multiple resources can be delivered in a single http request

Also the server can ""push"" multiple files to the client that it knows you will need (and in the order you need them) without having to first:

* send you the html

* let you parse it

* request those files.

Things like this won't be necessary any more:
 
* image sprites (pain to create

* js and css concatenation (page blocks while the css loads

* inlining your images with data-uri's (actually increases image size by 33%)

* inlining your css on the page (css can't be cached if used elsewhere)

* sharding your resources across multiple domains (wtf)

My small company won a contract to work with a very large well known international organization - I was on the team that complete the project

I was the only computer literate person in my small company (read typical nerd

I said it was out of my depth, and everyone both sides of the aisle was please with what I did.

Cut to a year later and the large organization essentially requested I turn this concept for data gathering into a large internal tool, storing it in a database and rendering information displays via a user interface...

well I didn't know anything about that, but I just say 'yeah I can look into ways of doing that, should take about a... week?'

Now I am paid way more than I used to be, but oh my god would I be embarrassed if a real web developer ever looked under the hood.

Even now when I look back at the stuff I did early on I facepalm... so I have cobbled together this specific knowledge that does what I need... but I feel all day every day as though I have NO IDEA WHAT I AM DOING.

I come to forums and read /r/webdev and I don't understand most of the words...


I guess I am just wondering if this is a common story, look up at me, and my cover will be blown.

Any advice? I've always tried to tell them at every stage that I don't have the requisite qualifications for this

For what it is worth I love learning about it


**EDIT:** What a great response from this community - so many supportive and informative answers have given me an inside track on a group of people I didn't really think I could relate to. I had a feeling many people felt in degrees like I do

A lot of good advice here as well about places to improve and things to make sure I don't screw up (like security). I''m going to redouble my enthusiasm and get stuck in. Thanks!

develop it.  Features at a glance:

 - Automatically visits registration/activation links in
   emails
 - Alternate mailbox names (aliases) for extra anonymity
 - Alternative domain names (all mail is accepted regardless of domain name)
 - Displaying HTML emails correctly including attached images
 - Multiple encodings supported: Chinese, Russian etc
 - RSS feed for every mailbox
 - New emails appear as they arrive
 - Fast

Since then
websites such as [Lifehacker](http://lifehacker.com/5847625/mailnesia-is-a-temporary-email-tool-that-automatically-clicks-registration-links)
[Makeuseof](http://www.makeuseof.com/dir/mailnesia-anonymous-disposable-email/) and [Ghacks](http://www.ghacks.net/2012/05/31/the-ultimate-disposable-email-provider-list-2012/).

I'm in perpetual battle with bots scraping the site.  Nginx is rate
limiting excess requests
banned automatically with fail2ban.  Opening too many mailboxes
triggers a captcha.  I had to implement reverse DNS checking so excess
RSS requests would only be allowed for Google feedfetcher.

Some statistics:

 - a few hundred thousand daily incoming mail (close to a million
 - Email retention time: few days
 - Tipically there are about 1-2 million emails in the system
 - In the first week of December the site had 173k unique visitors who
   made 357k pageviews (according to Google Analytics) - but that
   doesn't mean anything since 98% of those were bots scraping the
   site (banned since):
   http://blog.mailnesia.com/post/46812952774/chinese-botnet-strikes-again

Architecture:

 - Custom SMTP server implemented in perl.  Event based
   one thread.
 - Perl fastCGI website powered by Nginx web server.
 - Emails are stored in a PostgreSQL database on a 15 GB SSD disk 
 - Hosted on a virtual private server

Future plans under consideration:

 - Multiple editable aliases
 - turn autoclicker on/off (should the default value for all mailboxes
   be on or off?)
 - Settings page for the above (and possibly more) preferences on a

I always intuitive middle click the link because that's how (real) links are opened in new tabs/windows. However this sometimes fails.

Instead of just setting the target attribute to ""_blank"" so both left and middle click works

Why? Why not just using what's already in html and works?

~~

Also I've seen this on forms. Some forms are supposed to be processed by javascript, of which one is a button that triggers the javascript that uses the form data.

Isn't it better to use a form element, unnecessary code isn't that?

[http://muse.adobe.com/](http://muse.adobe.com/)

Last week I did a lecture explaining the advantages of HTML/CSS over older techniques (presentational HTML, etc). Adobe's Muse release makes ignores many of the advantages of CSS. All I see is ImageReady for a new generation.

Please take a look and view the source. 105 lines of neatly formatted HTML source. 41 lines of poorly formatted CSS (sorry).

A few notes:

* This is XHTML/CSS2 only (what my students are currently studying). As you can see HTML5 and CSS3 are not necessary for a site like this.
* No JS
* Mostly working in older versions of IE
* Tried to keep content is good source order.
* Most of the measurements/color/type was just eyeballed. Some it may be a little different to Adobe's original.
* Relies on the Segoe UI family of fonts. Otherwise defaults to sans-serif and looks a little worse.

* Here's a live demo: http://danneu.com/darkstrap/darkstrap.html
* Here's what Twitter Bootstrap 2.0 actually is

I'm actually developing a dark-themed project but the default Bootstrap wasn't giving me the vibes I wanted during development. I couldn't get into the Grunge Zone. So I made this and I'll continue updating/tweaking it since my own project just builds on top of it.

It's just a bunch of color

### Update

Thanks for the feedback. 

I'll push up some tweaks to it tonight, as someone pointed out. The input fields are blindingly white. And more.

I'll also try to make it more friend to developers

### Update 2

I wasn't sure if anyone would care about this project

Well

### Update 3

Made a big push just now that fills up the demo with all the Bootstrap examples and ensures they all work. I didn't really know what color to make the input fields,,False,self,t5_2qs0q,True,,True

Do you have any good post or article explaining how companies that build large web applications with a large team of developers (i think of FB, but also smaller companies like Spotify, ...) make all their developers work together in terms of :

- unit testing
- source version control
- definition of software components
- factorization of resources for styling (css
- QA
- deployment of production
- etc ...

I am especially interested in articles explaining how __large__ teams work together

FYI, Karma, Backbone, Angular, JS, CSS3, HTML5

let me outline what i have gotten for the consersation so far:

the good:

- wants to use an existing cms that already supports some sharing options

the bad:

- after emails and telephone calls i still dont have any idea of the purpose of the website. On the screnshots i see classifields, ads, and apparently there will be communities.

- didnt consult any designer; mockups look like websites from 10 years ago. No animated gifs; but just plain boring to put it nicely. pretty much like this:

    p {
    	background-color:black;
    	color:aqua;
    }
    
    h1, h4 {
    	background-color:aqua;
    	color:black;
    }

- the signup form is (i'm not making this up!) 7 screens long.

At this point, and i dont really see how this site would draw some interrest with no clear goal and a terrible conversation rate because the signup form is worse than doing your taxes.

What would be your advice of handeling this? I would like to do work and get paid; but the idea of spending time on a site that will never really take off seems like a waste of time and talent. However,,False,self,t5_2qs0q,False,,True

I said nothing and just opened Google Analytics with stats from this site (and this site is doing GREAT at the moment).

Details in the FAQ section

It's very handy when the user is uploading a large file, or have to close his browser, etc...

Because we slice up the files

I work in the precious metals wholesale business. We have 5 traders buying and selling all day long. We hedge our purchases on the COMEX exchange in NY. Every time we are long or short 100oz gold, our boss sells or buys a contract respectively.

Up until now, and he would keep tally on a piece of scratch paper. It was terrifyingly archaic.

I threw this app together in 5 hours flat. It simply lets the traders enter their trades into the computer and keeps it all tallied electronically. Every time we get long/short 100g/5000s

He loved the demo I pitched to him and we did a trial run today. It was an amazing feeling being able to set this up on all the traders computers and watch them so easily learn something you built. Since I'm a hobbyist developer and have never deployed anything to the public

1362619570.0,19tcn4,I'm a 20 year old web developer and just landed a full-time development position for $75k/year with benefits. Here is how!,theyoungdev,123,47,137,"Hey guys, instead of mundane assignments at school. Don't get me wrong, but deep down I just wanted to do what I wanted to do. I mainly dropped out because ~50% of the course material didn't directly relate to web development. 
  
What I did:  
  
**1. Join communities**  
  
Join online communities. Talk to people, /r/webdev and related, sitepoint, digitalpoint, google groups, facebook groups, whatever community that is related to your niche. In my case, frameworks, talk to people.
 
**2. I learned anything and everything I could**   
  
I originally started tinkering with web development when I was 14. I helped people install and run small PHP scripts to monitor their private game server online/offline status, then PHP. After two years of tinkering, I eventually charged people for these things and that gave me lots of experience.  
  
I used websites such as codecademy.com, MIT open courseware, and various other resources. I think the best resource I could ever recommend would be tutsplus. I signed up for a membership and went through their courses on jQuery, MySQL, PHP, different frameworks such as codeigniter, cakePHP
  
**3. Keep with the scene**  
  
This kind of ties into point 1. Read blogs of famous developers, video blogs, blogs. I follow a lot of famous web developers and startups on twitter/facebook. Usually they will link interesting articles, resources, and news. This allows you to be exposed to the latest technologies. This is actually how I found out about things like nodeJS, ruby, python
  
**4. BUILD THINGS**  
  
You can skip points 1-3, I don't know Python, but I want to build something with it"". Since I was super into Counter-Strike, I build add-ons compatible with eventscripts that were written in Python. I wrote various server plugins and gamemodes compatible with eventscripts. Every week/month/however long a project took, I would try a new technology, a new language, a new framework. Something I haven't previously built anything with
  
Due to this I have experience in a variety of different things.
  
**5. Network (probably the biggest key)**  
  
I happen to be fortunate, code collaborations, code groups. I went to all of it. I went to every hackathon I could find such as this: https://www.facebook.com/hackathon which I could afford from random freelance work. I went to school hosted hackathons and presentations. About once a week we would have someone on campus giving a talk about something or hosting an event. Some talks I went to were related to: open source development, raspberry pi club, linux talks, linux clubs, robotics clubs. Whenever I saw someone that was interesting, I would walk up to them and introduce myself and just talk. I'd then give them a business card or write down my info to keep in touch
  
**6. Develop an online presence**   
  
Personal portfolio. Github. Facebook. LinkedIn. Twitter. Whatever else. I created an online persona, tweeted it at various people, emailed people for feedback, and posted online.  
  
**7. Resume**    
  
With my resume, a PLETHORA of projects, my own domain, social media, github. This was all on my resume. I have all my languages that I have ever used. I divided this into four groups: Proficient, Exposed to, Currently leaning, interviewer found it quite funny). Anything I have ever touched was on my resume. Keep in mind though

ALWAYS TAILOR YOUR RESUME AND COVER LETTER TO THAT SPECIFIC POSITION. Personalize it
  
------------------------------------------------
  
The biggest tip I have is to not be overwhelmed. For a few months I was stuck in this little loop where I would always be afraid to develop something because I was too overwhelmed by the complexity of the technology and I felt like I always didn't know enough. The easiest thing I found was just to solve a problem. For example: I couldn't delete all the comments on one of my reddit accounts in an easy way, would send me an email. Things like that.  
  
Don't be afraid to meet people

1. College degrees are far from a requirement. Development and in particular web development is very much a meritocracy: those who are good do well and those who don't sink. As someone who has done hiring, machine learning, or Bayesian analysis. Even then, with some spare time and a desire to learn you can do those too.
2. A good place to start is HTML and CSS. Too many web devs can't do CSS worth a damn. Both of them are pretty easy to wrap your mind around and pretty essential in my opinion. After getting a firm grasp, you're always going to be using JavaScript on the front-end and with node.js occasionally on the back-end. And secondly, they're just aren't as many good JS devs as there are jobs for them.
3. Keep your LinkedIn up to date. I can't tell you how many awesome opportunities I've gotten because of this. It's not just Joe's Dev Shack in Timbuktu that's calling (though he does call), LinkedIn, Tesla Motor Company, SpaceX, Amazon, and some other really cool companies. Where did they all find me? LinkedIn. Every time.
4. Going back to experience, one-off jobs for Consuela's Maid Service made in Wordpress in a week) does not substitute. I rarely bring those up, if ever, in a professional interview.
5. Look for internships if you can't get a junior position. Maybe the pay isn't great
6. When you do get hired somewhere, I was still known as the MongoDB guy.
7. Keep up to date on new technologies. Occasionally have a weekend when you lock yourself in a room and build a whole new app just to learn a new technology. When I got one of my jobs, always be tinkering on your own. I've had so many positive experiences that way and learned a lot. Apps don't have to make you money. If you learn something while making it, that's an investment that will pay off later.

That's all I got off the top of my head. From the other grizzled dev-veterans

Many of the people that commented in that thread basically had the position that javascript is required for modern web browsing and that anyone running NoScript is some kind of paranoid nutcase. I feel like it's very important to set the record straight.

What is the purpose of NoScript?

NoScript is *not* meant to be a replacement for ad blockers (though it can certainly function like that). It's meant as a tool to whitelist sites so that they can run javascript while others cannot.

But why would you want to block javascript?

**XSS**

XSS allows an attacker to execute an arbitrary javascript payload under the targeted domain. 

This means they can access the DOM of preference pages to steal user data, submit forms, create custom forms that trick the user into sending data to the attacker etc.

Take the following scenario -

Hans the hacker ( I just made this up right now. :O ) has discovered a reflected XSS hole in bestbuy.com. He crafts a link that injects his script into an HDTV product page.

What does the script do?

* Changes the TV price from $2999 to $100
* Creates a message that says there's only 50 TV's left in stock.
* Creates a message that the mega discount promotion will expire in 1 hour.
* Replaces all add to cart and purchase buttons with his own buttons.

When you click the purchase button the script crafts what looks like the Best Buy checkout page. This can even be delayed slightly to simulate page load. The form requests your name, it sends all your data to the attacker and presents you with an order confirmation page explaining that due to very high order volume, please wait up to 24 hours for a confirmation email.

Hans then submits the link to r/technology with a clever title to build hype. People see there's not much stock/time left so they rush to order. Someone eventually comments that it's an attack and to not follow the link

*That* is a scenario NoScript protects you against. 


I am not a security professional. I find and report XSS holes as a hobby. That's why it troubles me to see comments like those I saw yesterday. It shows that some web devs, yet can't understand why anyone would use a white-list policy for javascript.

For more posts about browser security by people much more qualified than myself -

[r/netsec](http://www.reddit.com/r/netsec)

[r/xss](http://www.reddit.com/r/xss)

**tl;dr** - Allowing arbitrary javascript from untrusted domains by default can be dangerous. Also, and CSRF protections. Please don't spread the message that javascript is always harmless. It's not.

Powershell is its replacement and it's vastly different from many other CLI variants. It takes some learning but if you're developing on Windows

The key difference is that Powershell passes _objects_ through it's pipeline

Commands have a strict naming convention laid out in a {verb}-{noun} format

Almost all the typical *nix commands are already aliased to do the same thing in Powershell. mv, ps, kill, man etc. The main difference is grep, which is 'sls' (select-string).

Powershell has access to the .Net framework meaning if there's something that isn't handled directly via Powershell commands

There's a mini IDE included in the box - with PowershellISE

Tools to checkout:

 * PoshGit (or PoshHG) - expands your prompt (among other features) to include details of the current Git (or Hg) repo:
	https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git

 * Chocolately - http://chocolatey.org/ a Package Manager built with Powershell and Nuget.

 * Powershell itself can be hosted in a number of different environments - the default is based on the old school command host - it's crap

 * PowerTab vastly improves that the completion: http://powertab.codeplex.com

Microsoft themselves are headed further in this direction - Virtually the entire Server 2012 platform can be configured directly via Powershell.

The Azure platform - likewise

    New-AzureWebsite SomeCoolSite -github accountName\repo

Will create a new website

There's stacks more in the box, workflows...

I have a passion for graphic design and enjoy the logic-based thinking in programming

I'm currently using Codecademy to learn the foundation required to start making basic things and then teach myself the rest of the way. So far I really enjoy the program and have been learning a ton of stuff. I spend on average about 20 hours a week (for a week so far) doing lessons and trying to apply them on my own.

However, that it teaches you irrelevant things or that it teaches you bad practices.

All these negative comments (not just on reddit) make me feel like Codecademy is a waste of time if I want to break into the world of web development. 

When I began this, such as proper practices, how to prevent/find errors in my code, and how to organize it in a practical space saving way that will allow other programmers to understand where I left off in my code etc etc. I also have a few mentors who are computer programmers that are willing to help me and give  me tips. 

I KNOW the process of me becoming a developer is a long, I think my graduate degree and location, as well as design background can give me an edge once I get a lot better at web-dev.

Since beginning to work in Joomla

Here are some complaints.  In soap-boxing this

* **Documentation** -- What. The. Hell.  The documentation for developing in Joomla is *extremely* lacking.  The official Joomla API site just lists functions and shows you the code for those functions.  That doesn't tell me anything!  

The Joomla Documentation wiki looks like it was written by a bunch of angry software engineers that are begrudgingly telling you how their system works, and most explanations look like they're written more for the dev team than someone trying to put together a website.

To quote the great Louis Black

* **Routing** -- Routing in Joomla is an absolute joke.  You can give certain things like articles and menu destinations ""aliases, there seems to be no real way to get to it by putting in a URL. 

 Making test pages for components or modules seems near impossible.  I've been forced to mirror whole production websites so that I can add some new feature without it showing up on the live site for all the world to see.

* **Configuration** - Ok, but sometimes there isn't a one-to-one correspondence, and I just want to change something in the config file to see if something works.  

And another thing

* **Upgrading** -- There is no defined upgrade feature from what I can see.  I haven't had much time to explore 2.5

* **Scaling** -- Hooo boy.  I've seen Joomla sites that were nothing but text and images, it **is** the Joomla site that's causing problems, and it's not just one.  There's just no reason for that.

* **Development cycle** -- So let me get this straight.  It took a bazillion years to roll out Joomla 2.5.  And now nearly all of my company's themes, thanks for keeping me in the job, Joomla.

* **Third-party additions** -- Seem 90% crap.  Lots of them that I have purchased don't work or make the site 10 times slower at times.  But it's like that for Wordpress too

This is awfully rantish

**TLDR**; Joomla is stupid and I wish I was using Django instead.

**EDIT** I'm glad this got a lot of response.  People have been addressing many of these points in a really constructive and insightful manner.  While I was afraid this post could have been construed as another big-CMS flame rant,False,self,t5_2qs0q,1338146199.0,,,t3_u63jt

**Edit:**  To be fair

**Edit 2:** I've been banned from commenting on my commit

The main issue with their suggestion of a hidden field on the view is that every single template/theme ever made will require that change.

So, not just those that update their templates every time someone finds a bug in your controller.

Another problem with your suggestion is that it still assumes that the form field in question will be set, however, your codebase fails to do isset() or !empty() checks in hundreds of places.

You have zero form validation or error notification for the users.  You should be doing form validation/checking in the controller

I’ve been using many of the available online resources. I’m currently caught-up with CS50x, and I’ve been learning Python on the side. I’ve heard that Ruby and Ruby on Rails are the go-to languages of the moment, but I’ve yet to look into these.

Background info: I make 45k, it's not like I'm being paid a whole lot and there's a whole lot riding on my employment). I'm the sole on-site developer (they hire contractors few and far between, as needed) and I do mostly front-end with plenty of back-end, databases, blogs, CMS, SEO

I've been thinking lately about taking on some minor side work

Today my employer asked me to sign an employee agreement

**1) Avoiding Opportunity Conflict** - Any business opportunity (in my field) that comes to my attention is automatically the property of my Employer. Therefore, I'd have to run to my boss and go, ""Boss! Someone just offered me a freelancing opportunity! Want it? Because I'm tooootally not taking it!"")

**2) Insurance** - Loss of me, therefore the Employer can insure my life under a policy of life insurance. I will have to submit, whenever my Employer wants, paperwork that will allow him to obtain said insurance, and submit to any necessary physical examinations (I've heard of this one before, but seriously?).

**3) (Not sure I fully understand this as it may apply to things such as my portfolio, etc.) Confidential Obligations** - ""The Employee agrees that she will have no interest in Confidential Information, including, without limitation, know-how, copyright, trademarks or trade names, exactly?)

**4) Non-solicitation** - I can't solicit or hire away any employees or contractors with whom I have worked since I started working there

**5) Non-competition** - I can't be employed through any other means than my Employer without express written consent from now until 5 years after termination or expiration. Same for if I want to even work in the industry. (I think this is ridiculous.)

**6) Termination** - I may be terminated without notice; however

**7)** If anything happens and there's a lawsuit, but ok).

**8) **Also I hereby waive my ""moral rights"" that I may have with regard to the company and its material.

Any advice on whether everything here is reasonable?

Finally I sent the unsubscribe email about 15 times in a row. I figured if a human was behind the scenes

&gt; It said to send a one-line message with 'STOP youremailaddress'

But this is what your message looked like:

&gt; The automated system didn't know what to make of that. So it passed it on to me to read to try to figure out what it was about.

&gt; The trick is to choose 'plain text' formatting whenever you're sending something to an automated system.

I was using gmail and just hit reply. Does the average person even know how to switch to 'plain text mode'

The other few developers at work are older, and I don't blame anyone. Only by being a social derelict do even I have time for that. But my premise is that they are stagnant in their ways.

I've put a lot of effort the past couple years into learning how to write clear code. This job has only confirmed my suspicions that writing code is the easy part of development. Anybody can write code that does anything. In fact

The hard part is writing clear code

The other (senior) devs write code that's incredibly hard for me to follow.

Nested `if` statements. Monolithic classes that are really just a holding pot for a hundred unrelated functions. Monolithic methods. Untestable code (we don't have a real test suite). Methods that call methods in other files that mutate variables in other files that mutate the results of methods in this file.

Trying to wrap my mind around some code in our codebase involves me busting out pen and paper to track the program's state as I follow branched logic down a hole of a dozen different contexts. A single method will touch the database

This has taken a substantial toll on me lately as I approach burnout with our own product/codebase.

This is my first job and I don't know what to do about this. I don't have the chutzpah to sit down with the lead developer and explain that his code is hard to follow. I don't even know how one could do that without causing grief. 

How can I turn things around?

Using git can be as simple as typing ""git init"" in the directory you wish to put under version control. You can then commit, and use a large percentage of git commands in that single directory. If you wish to use the collaborative features, all you need is a ssh accessible machine. (or one of the other network protocols git supports, including it's own)

I recently became employed at a local web dev firm. There are 3 programmers;

- Me

- Co-worker 1

- Co-worker 2

*ALL* of our programming is done via flat PHP. No frameworks

- Co-worker 2 ""doesn't trust outside code"". He has some social / mental disorders I'm fairly sure, and faster. As I said, I'm not really worried about this guy - he's totally a lost cause. There's no way we'll ever convince him of anything.

- Co-worker 1, and freely available frameworks, are **industry standard** at this point. I'm trying to convince him that we're shooting ourselves in the foot and coming off as extremely amateur by refusing to accept any ""outside code"". 

I got him to do the CodeIgniter tutorial at which point his reply was ""I had to use like 8 files and a confusing architecture just for a Hello World app, but that there is a major benefit in the long run in terms of how quickly you can get a prototype up and running VS doing it in flat PHP. Not to mention all the boilerplate crap that is covered for you - form validation, object-relational mapping, etc...

But he simply **refuses** to believe that I'm right

He also is ignoring the industry. I'm someone who really, and learning new frameworks. 

It's painfully obvious that MVC is

That **alone** should be enough... thousands of people who are more experienced than anybody at our company are very clearly stating

I now realize that this is largely just a rant and that I might not be able to change my co-workers minds. 

I am someone who cares about doing things the right way. The most efficient way. The safest way. The most productive way. The way that will provide the least amount of headaches later on. The way that makes me get products out the door in the fastest way possible (while still maintaining quality). Because I have these traits

It's like somebody riding a bicycle with their break pads constantly grinding their wheels. It's slowing them down, and is overall really, really bad for the whole biking process.
