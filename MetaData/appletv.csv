1370025091.0,1ff30i,Plex on AppleTV 3 Without Jailbreak or AirPlay is now Possible,erkston,88,5,42,"A couple of fine folks over in the Plex forums have created a tool called PlexConnect:

&gt;The basic idea is

&gt;re-use a native AppleTV app (in this case Apple Trailers)

&gt;re-route the Trailers app requests to your local Plex Media Server

&gt;re-work the reply to fit into AppleTV's XML communication scheme

&gt;let iOS do the rest

&gt;enjoy Plex on your unmodified AppleTV


Quite a nifty little trick that works wonders.  Haven't seen it mentioned on here anywhere so I thought I'd just post as I'm sure many people (like myself) use their AppleTV almost exclusively for Plex.

1369238147.0,1eu99c,An Honest Apple TV Review,Zenador78,31,7,20,"This thing does everything…. Ok

Apple TV $109
HDMI Cable $20

Physical setup took 5 minutes. Power connected

Software setup took another 5 minutes

My home network has 2 routers, and ISA Server 2006 for my VPN connection to my home network from remote and internet monitoring (again, kids sucking up all the bandwidth.) Apple TV had ZERO issues with my non-standard home setup. It just worked. 

Anything I have syncing to the iCloud, they were all immediately available on Apple TV. On my desktop running iTunes, I enabled Home Sharing and immediately got access to my entire library, all music, all videos,  my photos. Whatever is shared in iTunes is accessible on the TV. 

It has built-in Netflix and other streaming capabilities

The iPad to Apple TV is probably the coolest part, video, my SiriusXM internet player, or 3rd party player, can be streamed from the iPad to the TV and stereo. It also has the option to mirror the display (and sound) of the iPad on the TV. I have played games and put it on the TV so others can see. I have a flyer app that I use for all the big retailers, so if I saw something interesting, I can just toss it up on the TV so everyone in the room can see it, or pass around my iPad. Basically you can just extend the iPad display and sound to your home theatre. 

Multiple accounts are also supported on Apple TV. I setup my wife’s account

Screensaver options include some built-in stuff from National Geographic, to my personal account. You could link it to anyone’s public Flickr stream, or you can have it search for keywords and display what it finds. (Note: there is no content control for the Flickr part, so if you search for something, it will be shown. This includes any nudity/pornographic images which do not have appropriate Flickr flags set on them.)

The Remote app from the App Store is not required, find letter, click.

My daughter’s Apple ID was not added to the device

The audio and video “channels” are separate on Apple TV. I was playing music alone from my iPad to the box, Apply TV just moves to the latest request. So if you wanted to be childish, two people could just fight with the broadcast function… My tunes/her tunes/my tunes/her tunes… and on and on and on…. That’s probably my only issue with it.

I have not done any testing with it for say access to Windows Media Center – But I could. I’ve just always used iTunes to manage my library. There are other things shown on the Apple TV home screen

- If you have an Android phone or tablet you can, TED talks, Break, Facebook, NASA, Vimeo. (I think it's also available in the Apple store.)
- If you like Jeopardy or Wheel of Fortune, by some random user in HD. (There are a few other shows on there, too, like older Doctor Who.)
- You can stream Sirius/XM satellite radio via AirPlay which adds tons of commercial free radio stations to your ""ATV experience."" haha. Don't have Sirius/XM? Don't have Sirius/XM? Turns out you can get a ""free 30 day trial"" at https://siriusxm.com/ondemand - without needing to enter a credit card. Just, email address and zip code. You can rinse and repeat at the end of any free trial. (I wish they'd add a Sirius/XM channel though. Can't stream from my Android devices.)

So there are just a few things I do and watch to enhance my ""experience."" Anyone have shows they watch via alternative apps and airplay? Or have other tips?

Other shows I watch via the 'Dailymotion' channel from the app:

- Mrs. Browns Boys (HILARIOUS Irish sitcom. Seriously
- Burnistoun (Scottish sketch comedy TV show.)
- Biggest Loser Australia (OK
- Frozen Planet (amazing and beautiful documentary)
- Outnumbered (people who like shows like Modern Family will dig this.
- Primeval (really awesome science fiction TV show. Good special effects.)

Other shows I've seen episodes of on there (not recommendations): Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, Goosebumps, Mork and Mindy, Bosom Buddies... In fact, just searching for the phrase ""s01e01"" will find many shows for you. Then, click on the user that uploaded an episode of a show you like and see what else they've uploaded.",,,,

Anyway. I've been reading about Plex

Basically my parents have this gigantic DVD collection that just collects dust and takes up a whole lot of space. I was thinking I'd try to make their lives a little easier and more efficient. 

What I've pieced together, and use Plex to access all of it via appletv. Is this at all doable? Am I completely missing something? 

Is Plex user friendly? Could I upload cover art, can I have a separate folder for each season? Is Handbrake easy to use? 

More importantly

Lastly

For what it's worth

I'm not totally inept when it comes to technology. It's just that a lot of this media server stuff, and it gets to be overwhelming trying to piece it all together. 

**tl;dr:** I'm curious if there's a way to access files on an external hard drive connected to a router on an appletv via plex or other means. And also what this program called Handbrake is about.

Many thanks to /u/Ream for guidance. The steps are very simple

1. [MakeMKV](http://www.makemkv.com/download/) to rip the DVDs to separate mkv files. 

2. [MKVmerge](http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html) (part of the mkvtoolnix package) to combine the files into a single mkv. Add the first mkv, whatever) part onto the first. Don't just add all the files to the list.

3. [HandBrake](http://handbrake.fr/downloads.php) to convert the mkv from step 2 to an m4v. (Note that you may want to go to the Chapters tab and fix the numbering. Many multi-DVD movies start numbering their chapters from 1 again on the second disc.)

Takes fricken forever to send a video to the Apple TV.

It's *WAY* slower than it looks like in the commercials. Should I be expecting faster stream times? I mean I may as well go write a book if I want to watch some family movies because they take forever to stream. The PS3 and Xbox 360 on the same network have no issue instant streaming movies.

* Subsonic Support

I ask as the sound quality seems to be diminished

* On a second machine, but to avoid duplication I don't have that machine set up to move things to central library.  They are spread across many directories, so subdividing further won't really help.

* Do you use Handbrake to convert your non-MKV files, and full compatibility with Apple TV.

* Sort of an iTunes question

* What is a good recipe for a home made thin crust pizza dough?

* I know there is no ATV3 JB yet

I think this has been asked before

2) is there any chance of hbo go

4) if not is there a good program for windows that can put the meta data on for me? ive been googling and it seems like only good ones are mac exclusive which is frustrating as hell. the only one ive found that was decent but not great was metaX.

5) is there a way i can add itunes store metadata to my mp4 files with itunes?

6) is the homeharing video quality good? i use my 360 and ps3 as media servers a lot and the quality looks great wifi or not should i expect that same great quality with the apple tv?

Sounds like I can get an AppleTV, plus the added benefit of being able to buy/rent movies from Apple (Would like to try and go a bit more legit). So, first of all, I live in The Netherlands, but I used to live in the states and I still have a US bank account that I keep open primarily for my Apple account. So I have a legit US iTunes account. Will I be able to rent and buy movies from Apple? Or is there some kind of IP block. I know I can't get Netflix to work on my PS3 or anything unless I get a VPN or something which I haven't bothered doing yet. I would imagine that Netflix wouldn't work on AppleTV for me, though, right? But what about Apple? Oh and what about Hulu?

If I buy an AppleTV here in The Netherlands

How do you watch DVDs? I still have some PAL and NTSC DVDs that I want to watch from time to time. Now

Also

I was sort of waiting to jump on the ATV bandwagon until it had sort of gelled a bit better, or just things not working like they're supposed to, unexplained problems, that sort of thing. Anything like that with ATV?

I have tried the latest Seas0npass and the downgrade to 4.4.2 as found on the Firecore forums; both result in the same iTunes error above.


I think it might have something to do with DFU. My ATV2 will not power on at all with just a micro usb connection. I have tried 3 computers and 3 cables with the same issue. I have run iREB with the power cable + micro usb cable in and iREB indicates that the ATV2 is in a pwned DFU state


This is the procedure I'm using to get into DFU:

1. Plug in USB and Power cable to ATV2
2. Open iReb
3. Turn on power switch (ATV2 slowly blinks)
4. Hold down Menu + Play/Pause (Faster Blinking)
5. After about 5 or so seconds the blink rate goes much faster (fastest blinking)
6. Release Menu + Play/Pause.
7. ATV2 is detected by Windows/iTunes. iREB succeeds in exploiting the ATV.


I would really appreciate any help in resolving this.",,t5_2s3df,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/appletv/comments/rmy9f/apple_tv_2_ios_51_cannot_jailbreak_please_help/

Issue #1) Apple changed the sorting of shows, again. Now all my shows that are local appear in a what appears to be a random order when listed on my working Apple TV. 

Issue #2) The 5.0 update essentially bricked one of my two Apple TVs. My Apple TV now will play 5 minutes of local content and dump to the main screen saying that there is no home sharing turned on my local mac. If I do a hard reset of the Apple TV

My other Apple TV took the update just fine and shows no aberration playing videos. Looks like I am buying an Apple TV 3.

1329831605.0,pzaex,Linux 1st gen Apple TV and NAS.  ,Luminal,1,2,0,"Right
Currently I have an Apple TV 1st gen with ATVflash installed I also have a 2nd gen Apple TV with ATVFlash installed.
I currently use SMB file sharing on the 1st gen Apple TV and use the media player on the 2nd gen Apple Tv to stream my files to the 2nd gen.
From my laptop I can drag and drop files to the 1st gen Apple Tv and watch them on the 2nd gen Apple TV.  
This is simple and works effectively.  (The 1st gen operates like a NAS).
What I am toying with is installing a version on Linux to the 1st gen Apple Tv to give me a little more flexibility on the 1st gen
Having Google'd  this I've come across some different ways of achieving this but the distros I have found with relatively simple installs act as a way to make the 1st gen Apple TV a better media player.
This isn't required I would just like it to be a better NAS.

I'd also rather not have to plug a keyboard into the 1st gen ATV.

Any thoughts/recommendations from the Reddit community?

I'm a bit of a Linux noob so I don't want anything too complicated.

Thanks in advance.
