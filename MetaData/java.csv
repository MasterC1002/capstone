In an attempt to address this situation

To be clear, not an obfuscator), results in bytecode for which decompilers such as Jad and JD-GUI have been unable to produce correct/equivalent Java code.

I am particularly interested in examples involving complex uses of:

  1. `try`/`finally` or `synchronized` blocks;
  
  2. `break` and `continue` statements with explicit target labels on outer loops or non-loop statements;
  
  3. general local/inner class weirdness related to synthetic members, etc.

For code which is runtime-generated or compiled by anything other than javac

**NOTE:** For now

I'd rather not get into NDAs and the like

...I was thinking...at 3am in the morning after little sleep.

Here is why I use Java (where Java == Java Platform

* Community.  Java has a large one.  It probably is the most popular language.  Competing with C and C++.   Note: C++ was created in the 80s.   C was created in 1972.  Java in 1995.  The community is pretty substantial.  There are millions of developers in Europe, everywhere.
* Enterprise Community.  There are a lot of professional Java programmers.  People actually pay Java programmers to write code.  There are a lot of companies like Oracle, Walmart that setup and attend conferences, technology conferences like JavaOne.
* Tools, IntelliJ.  There are Java tools for RIA like Flex, Flex Builder.
* Libraries.  There a lot of useful ones.  There is Terracotta for clustering.  Apache Lucene for indexing.  GWT Google Web Toolkit for RIA technology.  Wicket, SWT, Java on OpenGL, Java Mail, JMS, on and on.
* JVM languages.  Popular implementation of other languages exist in Java.  Jython is popular.  JRuby, ABCL (Common Lisp) exist.
* Java may have a slow(er) bootup time
* Java has a large standard set of mature libraries; GUI, Messaging, Web Application development, Javadoc, etc, etc.  Or use Apache commons if you don't like what Oracle/Sun has to offer.
* Security - mature security libraries exist.
* Internalization 
* Negative: Java the language has some issues.  I won't enumerate them here.
* Java the runtime is pretty widespread.  Most desktop computers have a version of the runtime.  Users are getting familiar with how to run a jar or webstart or applet.  A Java is more common than a Common Lisp one.
* Java is open
* Java WORA is mostly true.  Java has automatic memory management.
* Niche of a Niche:  Even the fringe stuff in the Java world works.  I used the popular AIML library the other day.  The OpenNLP library is pretty solid.  Lucene/Hadoop/Terracotta clustering are pretty cool.  I want to mess around with the Java media framework next.
* Reddit

For web application (stuff I mostly work with)

I will probably drop Ruby completely.  But

What are your thoughts?  I know people tend to attack the language exclusively.  And some people have fair arguments with language features that allow you to be more productive in other languages

I notice people on reddit attack Java, does Microsoft really suck?  My 2 cents.

1376417534.0,1kak03,So I visited Oracle a couple of days ago and wanted to share my experience,thrway_java,52,14,37,"So I made a throwaway account because I'm not sure what to expect when sharing something like this. A couple of days ago I visited Oracle to learn a little bit more about the upcoming release of Java EE 7

So let me start by saying the Oracle building looks pretty cool both on the inside and the outside it looks like a cool place to work. But anyways onto the experience. A couple of friends and me get to the building, java coffee mugs, candy) and the conferences start.

Let me get this out of the way fist, we get a glimpse of what the new Java EE 7 can do with JSF, Glassfish, they talk about ditching XML for JSON (funny enough Netbeans and java FX use XML a lot). Then it's time for Q&amp;A and this is where it gets interesting, many members from the audience are from different companies (event IBM workers made an appearance too), there's some interesting questions asked:

Q. How do I convince my direct supervisor to change from Java EE 6

(I kid you not with this answer)
A. Well we can't be sure

I really have a mixed bag of feelings after hearing this answer

Q. You released a lot of technologies this time, these are the ones to help me in the near future regardless of any possible change?

(Again very umm interesting answer)
A. Well make the time to learn them all (Gives a book related to one of the technologies) and better start soon. (End of answer).

I'm thinking at this point. Ok.......... Pretty straightforward answer at least the fella got a free book

Q. Why does this particular technology (can't remember the name of it) It's pretty slow and it's such a memory hogger

(This is where I felt sorry for one of the IBM guys attending the conference)

A. It's IBM's fault, and interestingly enough, on the imports section we find ""com.IBM.something......"") everyone was surprised BUT if you want to make it better, help us created the next java specification.....

At this point I really felt sorry for the IBM fella as he got laughed at for something he perhaps didn't even touch.

Then one of the attendee's made a remarkable observation because the guy giving the presentation mentioned helping oracle with the next java specification

Q. How can we help for the next java specification because If I'm honest I don't have knowledge of certain things such as compilers and some of the underlying technologies

A. Well it is your duty to learn about all of those things if you want to help (fair enough I think to myself). But it should be the duty of anyone learning to code

I could rant so much about this answer but I think a discussion would be much better.

So the conference ends and we get a small break with pizza and we get to do networks with lots of guys around the IT industry people from Oracle

What's your opinion on such things said in this particular conference?

Thanks for reading :D

EDIT: Thanks a lot to all who're contributing to give light to some of these questions I'll be sure to tell some of the people I met during the event.

Our new code caused their unit tests to fail in our CI build system.  After some investigation I discovered that their unit tests pass only because JUnit happens to run them in the order they're currently running.

It seemed obvious it was something they needed to look into

I backed out all of out changes and checked in this.

3. Documentation. Currently I have none. Any suggestions on what I should have? I'm thinking a readme

4. Tests. Ah yes. Tests came after, every single job description you see practically lists TDD as a required skill (oops). I changed perhaps 3 lines of code because of them (little things that I was slacking on optimizing). To me, my tests are harder to understand than the code itself, more complicated than the code itself, and longer than the code itself.

I wrote a bunch. Really, I get to points of how should I even begin to test my screen and manager classes...

So what I'm asking is... how would you go about testing something like this? Dare you look at my tests, 6, would I be frowned upon for having so few?

So, or has the JVM become more efficient than trying to hard-code optimizations by hand?

At ""home"", for example, and WSGI, and Chameleon templating. HTML 5 feels right. CSS3 feels right. jQuery feels right. Google App Engine's webapp framework is pretty fun.

I'm pretty unhappy with our Java web development experience. For middleware, the more it feels wrong.

Some particular things I dislike:

* Lots of XML editing
* Developers need to keep lots of files open to get anything done
* Long redeploy/edit-to-test times (upwards of 30 seconds) for things like editing JavaScript or HTML
* Complex JSP-based views where people only partially understand what the soup of custom tags is doing
* Convoluted frameworks that make it hard to understand what's going on
* A 50 frame stacktrace between the request (""what went wrong in the browser"") and the Java code we wrote (""what went wrong in our application"")

I'd like to ask what other people use on the JVM that ""feels"" right. I don't necessarily want to throw out Java (my dev team would probably have a heart attack)

I am looking basically for some tutorials/books that teach basic Java and up while teaching you to code games. I understand it takes more than just the basics to make a good game.

With Python and WX I can usually have a moderately complex gui up and running in a couple of hours -- and it will look completely native (because WX actually uses the OS). Thus far, it's going to be a *huge* pain.

The JCP (Java Community Process) is the body that decides on what features will be implemented in future Java version.

The bug is about a ""struct""-like handling of data inside ByteBuffer-s. Its not a ""struct"" syntax for Java in itself, the data inside the buffers could be directly assigned to.

Some of the comments for the RFE were mistaken, which is not bad. Despite that, the JCP and the developers never took an effort to implement it.

Then when i took a look at it now, and not on efficient handling of external library-dependent data.

The unfair thing is, without anyone doing anything), which has probably irritated them. So they closed the RFE with the excuse that its a duplicate, and linked it to the RFE which has much less votes. 

The moral of the story: You can do games (or any other heavily JNI dependent stuff) in Java

1319315107.0,llbel,Getting into Java. I would love it if you answered some of my questions!,Mfah,31,8,25,"Heyo! 

First off
I'm 21 years old. When I was 12 I was introduced to Visual Basic
So

So. I did a tiny bit of research and figured Java would be a good language to learn. I figured it would be cool to be able to make simple games for example iPhone and android

So. I'm using http://javalessons.com/ to learn and I'm in the middle of  the ""Java fundamentals"" introductory course. I like the setup with using examples to show how it works

So

1. Do any of you have any experience with javalessons.com? Do you have knowledge of any other sites that are better?

2. Is there a wiki or database of some sort that explains stuff? For example if I see the line ""java.awt.TextArea  ta  = new java.awt."" and I don't know what ""TextArea"" is

3. In these examples they usually do things like ""import java.awt*"". What is it that I'm importing, and what ""tools"" they include? (God, I must sound like such an idiot if I got this completely wrong ^^)

4. They use the word ""void"" a lot. For example: ""public void init ()"". Sometimes the Methods don't have ""Void""; and it just says ""public *name of method*"". What does void mean

5. Does Java seem to fit my interest

6. I use DrJava to write and compile in. Is there a better program that you would recommend? 

7. I'm guessing DrJava isn't actually called a compiler

I understand that these questions are kind of vague

Thanks :)",,t5_2qhd7,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/llbel/getting_into_java_i_would_love_it_if_you_answered/

To give you some background information for my questions: I have a Ph.D. in mathematics, but I've learned programming pretty well. My strengths are ActionScript, and now Javascript, and I'm learning Java too, which is really not hard coming from an ActionScript background. I understand object-oriented programming well.

I teach at a private high school, so I'm kind of free to structure the course however I like. (That's so liberating!)

Right now I'm envisioning the class starting off with Processing, arrays, classes, etc), then I'll move them into Java programming, first on the command line then in an IDE (probably Eclipse).

But anyway, but...if you had to put together a list of things that Java is used for, in a way that high school students new to programming could understand, what might you include?

Of course

    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();

So I thought I'll just extend the Stringbuilder class and add a method:

    public void appendLine(String s);

with the obvious semantics.
But I find I can't do that because the StringBuilder class is declared as 'final' why?

I've vaguely googled a bit for this but the answer generally seems to be:
""You would make a class Final in Java if you do not want anybody to inherit the features of your class. ""
and ""You don't want anybody to inherit from your class because that code would not work"" but I can't seem to get a reasonable explanation for *why* it might not work.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/java/comments/l846d/would_anyone_else_be_interested_in_an_rjava/)


The first task is based on a programming kata by Kent Beck [RomanNumerals](http://www.codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRomanNumerals). The object of the task is that you take any number up to 3000 and convert it to Roman numerals. 

The roman numberals are 

* I
* V
* X
* L
* C
* D
* M

As an example given the input 1459 your application should print MCDLIX. You do not need to convert numbers higher than 3000. 


I'm reccomending doing this using [TDD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). If there are any questions or you need any help then just ask! I'll be posting a solution shortly but I'm advising you try it first then look at the other solutions. The whole point of this is that we code review each others solutions and I'll post the best one here before we start the next one! (hopefully)


Because the solutions might be quite large I proposing we use [paste bin](http://pastebin.com/)

Basically I'm in java 1.6 (1.6.0_38 if it matters) and I need to use an XSL I've written to transform an XML document to an HTML document.  Now I had written something a while back that worked until my boss wanted some of the timestamps in the XML to be reformatted.  I don't have access to anything fancy like Altova or  Saxon, which is unfortunate.

Anyway, and included the format-date function from their site and got it working locally.  I was testing by running the same maven build that our jenkins server runs.  When I tried actually executing the code in an real integration test on our dev server it failed.  When I had gotten it working originally I had used .getResource() and pulled something from that URI to use a SystemId with the TransformerFactory but when the application is deployed it's bundled into a jar along with an apparently custom written container and executed.  So SystemId is kindof useless I gather since I'm inside a jar file.  I reworked my code to instead use a quickly hacked together URIResolver that did the same getClass().getClassLoader().getResourceAsStream() that I did to get the first xsl figuring I needed it to get the relatively imported EXSLT files.  This worked locally but failed when jenkins ran the tests and when the application actually ran.  According to server logs the URIResolver I wrote was never even called apart from when I called the constructor to pass it in.  I have no idea why.  All I ever saw was

ERROR: 'null'  
FATAL ERROR: 'Could not compile stylesheet'

Eventually I gave up when google ran dry and switched my xsl to use the xmlns:java=""http://xml.apache.org/xslt/java"" namespace and called static functions to do the date formatting

At this point I've given up and written a fugly pure-java with HTML templates and XPath queries just get something that functions but I really feel like I need to figure out,,False,,t5_2qhd7,False,,True

Some of this infrastructure was built pre-1.2, I have a need to make some changes to the underlying implementation

All that is pretty straight forward

One option that has come to mind is to instantiate my own classloader and load my version of log4j in it, I call it via my custom loaded version.  Would that work?  Is there a better way?  OSGi looks like a possible approach, but given the legacy nature of this environment, that's a bigger leap than I think I can take on right now.  Looking for other options I'm not considering.

TL;DR:  Need to load a specific version of an open source JAR that is already used by many apps, especially if OSGi isn't an option?
