1331181811.0,qmw79,The darkside of reddit's real-time social science experiment on live human subjects,Joe_12265,44,10,16,"**Edit: jasonp1982's account now appears restored.  His user page no longer 404s.**

This is an interesting case study.  I think it is a sad case that everyone should be able to take a look at and see how they feel about it.  It has aspects of experimentation on human subjects that comes with no review

First, post comments, up and downvote etc.  However, what the user does *not* know is that no one else can see these actions.  It is a sort of cruel experiment wherein subjects are placed into an everlasting timeout.  The site appears to that user to be fully functional but is actually suppressing everything that person does.

I've known this existed for a while.  However, since that time his contributions have been positive and in some cases important.  His reviews of the email providers in the thread linked above were very informative.

I'd like everyone to take a look at jasonp1982's [posting history](https://imgur.com/a/0kD6B/noscript).  You'll note that after his initial posts he has no up or downvotes on his posts.  That is because no one was seeing them right up until I manually approved the post to r/privacy.  Then of course you can see his account come alive because he has a real contribution to make.  Please note I'm not nominating him for redditor of the year, systematically, by reddit.  I guess it made me a little sad even though that sounds a bit sappy, there it is.  As far as I know there is no appeal process.

If you think this sucks you can do some things.

1) I'd love some discussion of ninjabanning.  Is this good

2) If you want to upvote this as an issue you can do it in the thread I posted in [r/reportthespammers](https://pay.reddit.com/r/reportthespammers/comments/qlu88/can_i_get_a_review_of_jasonp1982/).

3) You can PM the mods and ask them to reconsider the ban of jasonp1982 and/or stop the practice of ninjabanning.",,t5_2qkkb,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/science2/comments/qmw79/the_darkside_of_reddits_realtime_social_science/

And a bright future it is!

What they've created is a small silicon crystal with a few coatings on it that

So what can you do with this?  Collect the oxygen and hydrogen, the ""waste"" product from burning hydrogen gas is pure water, so if you put the crystal catalyst in a source of dirty water, collect the gas, then burn it, you've got a water treatment plant.  Or a desalinization plant, if you like.

Cheap, they'll stop wars over water before they even happen, they'll solve global warming, and they'll solve the energy crisis for the foreseeable future.  They'll also be a big step toward pulling the third world out of poverty.

Watch this lecture now so you in two years you can tell everyone you knew about artificial photosynthesis before it was cool.
