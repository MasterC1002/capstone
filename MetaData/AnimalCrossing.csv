1371677667.0,1gomce,[PSA] Things to do Daily,alphawavegaming,742,99,304,"*This is a list based off of what I've discovered thus far feel free to remind me of anything I may have missed*

* **Shake all the trees in your town.** *You will usually find ~1k in coins,500 bells, with the hives selling for 500 bells.*

* **Hit all the rocks in town with your shovel.** *There is a money rock and a gem rock every day. Pro tip: Dig holes all around you before you hit the rock so that you don't slide backwards if it's a money rock*

* **Buy everything in Nookington Junction/any upgraded version.** *The upgrades for the store is based on how much money you spend / items you buy from them. This includes the fortune cookie. Clean those raccoons out!*

* **Dig up anything you see buried.** *You will always find four fossils everyday. Some days you will find 3 Gyroids(crazy wood guys) buried as well
  
      * **Gyroids appear the day after it rained or snowed!**

* **Buy out the flower shop every day.** *Buying 50 saplings will get you a Gold Axe. Buy 50 flowers and you get a silver watering can.*

* **Check Tom Nooks House store.** *There may be a unique house upgrade for the path/fence/roof/housestyle that wasn't there the day before*

* **BUY OUT the Abel Sisters store for new clothing/accessories.** *You never know when your perfect Jack the ripper look can be completed,000 bells Kicks opens up!*

* **Check your beaches for unique items/rare shells.** *Mysterious items and/or persons can wash up on your shores!*

* **Check Retail for turnip prices

* **Go to the island.** *The silver coin store gets updated daily

* **Donate new fossils/fish/bugs/sea-creatures to Blathers.** 

   *2nd floor Museum requirements are*:

   * **Donate at least 1 item of each type to the museum**
   * **Be mayor for at least 7 days**
   * **Have at least 30 total items donated**
Blathers will then be awake in the morning one day and will ask you to help him expand the museum.

* **Talk to all of your villagers!** *Often you can get hard to find furniture pieces from interactions with villagers. Try and carry furniture/fish/bugs with you as they will often want to trade or buy what you have*

* **Go swimming in the ocean and find that scallop!** *Pascal is an otter who will ask for the scallop you find. He gives you an item from the sea collection which is hard to find!*

* **Try and build a new public works project every day.** *It may be hard to find the funds

* **Go into your villagers' house when they're home and look in their closet.** *Sometimes they will give you a random item.*

* **Talk to Sable!** *After a while you'll get her to be friends with you and she'll let you use the QR machine so you can share patterns.*

* **Water all your flowers.** *This may sounds tedious but it builds villager satisfaction

* **Talk to Brewster everyday(The Roost Cafe)**  *If you go and get coffee their everyday for a while

* **Update your Dream Suite town.**  *You get 5000 bells every time

**Super Pro Life Storage Tip:**After you check your mail keep all 10 slots full with open letters. Doesn't matter if they were read ones or you created them by writing letters. That way you can store your equipment (shovel, watering can, wetsuit, etc.) in them without taking up inventory space. You can't stuff bugs/fish into letters though.

Okay so I've tested this method for about a week and I have gotten a request every day so I believe that it works. That

~~NOTE: Requires wet suit!~~ **Does NOT require wet suit!**

Here's what you do:

**Step 1:** Empty your pockets of all items and carry minimal money (preferably no money). **NOT required but suggested to avoid villagers asking you to buy their items or trade items**

~~Step 2: Put on your wet suit.~~

~~Step 3: Go swimming for a few minutes and get stung by jellyfish at least once.~~

**Step 2:** Go do something where villagers cannot see you. It can be swimming, etc. As long as villagers do not see you for around 5 minutes, you're good. You MUST be outside and in town. If you go inside or to Main Street, you will reset the clock.

**Step 3:** ~~Get out of the water and~~ Go walk around town in front of all your villagers that are outside. At least one should get the ""BING"" sound and lines above their head (sorry not sure what that's called). Go talk to that person. They will either ask you to do a favor, ask a random question, or **request a Public Works project!**

If you get a public works request, you will probably not be able to get another one.

I read about this method on a forum (can't remember which one) and I thought it was BS but I was shocked to see that it actually worked for me. Some days I get the request first try but other times it takes 4-5 times. But the end result is the same

**If you are not getting any bings after a few tries,"" reload the game, and try again.**",,False,self,t5_2ro2c,,http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1hs2lo/possible_way_to_get_villagers_to_request_public/

* **Nintendo items**: you should be able to trade in winning tickets for a random piece of regular furniture if you want. I have like 4 Super Stars and Midna's Masks.

* **Fruit AUTO-STACK**

* **Balloon items**: using different slingshots changes the possible content of the presents. Normal/other tool-- balloon furniture items; Silver-- random furniture; Gold-- random furniture plus random spotlight items

* **Villagers moving in**: when a new villager arrives, near the beach) to make it feel less like you're railroading them.

* Beautiful town ordinance should make **grass** only deteriorate if you run/Grass should just straight up not deteriorate unless you run. I *never* run in my town and it's going to look like Fallout 3 by winter.

* **More ordinances**: maybe a pair of ordinances that remove the bottom 10% most common fish/bugs

* **Multiple ordinances** active: at a certain level of town development

* **More weather + effects**: One thing I miss from WW was that sometimes it would be foggy/misty really early in the morning. I'd like to see more types of weather like fog, etc. and more environmental/villager effects due to weather-- I'd like to see flowers/trees dripping water in the rain and the water on the beach getting more rough. When it's thunderstorming out, I'd like to see my villagers all head indoors and lights come on. Only I am (or at least not ALL of my villagers are) crazy enough to walk around in a lightning storm carrying a pointed metal object above my head.

* **More villagers out**

* Let the **megaphone** work in multiplayer.

* Wearing **swimming items** (e.g. snorkel mask

* Activate a **placement ""advanced mode""**: Use the touch screen and a grid format to place new buildings

* (Probably an idea for the next game) **Different biome towns**: be able to pick different biomes/climates for your town, levels of dryness/wetness, etc.

* **Mayor-created holidays**: the villagers remark that you should make up holidays when there isn't an in-game one coming up. This is just empty conversation, etc.), pick an item for Isabelle to hand out (ice cream, tweeter, balloon, etc.), pick a special visitor to invite who might also give out an item etc.

So i created a flat web page (no images

Here's how you use it:

* take screenshot using L+R 
* press Home button
* launch web browser (your game is still running
* point it to the very easily typed URL [loik.li](http://www.loik.li)
* tap the button to choose a screenshot to upload
* 2 QR codes are generated

The 1st QR code is a link to the image file.  
Use this to upload to imgur ""from Web"".

The 2nd QR code will cause your phone browser to save the image file directly.  (usually into your phone's ""Downloads"" directory)  
This is for your own use to share on facebook, or whatever else you have on your phone.

I remember someone on here saying that he was never intended to be seen as ""robber baron"" sort of character in the first place... IMO

I think taking him out of the role of the shopkeeper was a really good move. He's no longer the center of the economy; you earn your bells from Reese, or it is a very small amount to Cyrus for refurbishing. All other spending is spread out across other shops.

So now Tom Nook is solely in charge of homes

Finally, and because you can see him in the cafe.

TLDR: I'm glad that I can love Tom Nook now

[Someone wrote a very in-depth guide about _City Folk_ grass deterioration](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/3343548/1/)

**Things that seem to be true / are broadly corroborated:**

* Sprinting (holding down ""B"" while moving) wears grass down faster than walking over it
* Rain and snow promote grass growth.
* [Fertilizer does not promote grass growth.](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/5784242/1/#MessageID65189532) Fertilizer [is used to improve the chances of flowers breeding and of trees producing ""delicious"" fruit](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/5709123/1/Usage_of_Fertilizer).
* [Pattern tiles can be laid down to make paths](http://www.thonky.com/animal-crossing-new-leaf/grass-wear/)

**Things that are said to be true:**

* [Walking quickly does not wear down grass](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/caksl0m); only sprinting by holding down ""B"" has a noticeable effect.
* Planting flowers over mud patches and then watering them daily with the watering can is said to promote grass growth. [Someone raised a good question about this yesterday.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gfw38/questions_about_grass_wear/cajuqdf) I'm going to experiment by planting some flowers in the middle of a large mud spot and leaving the rest bare.
* [Watering grass with the watering can is said not to promote grass growth.](http://bidoofcrossing.tumblr.com/post/41357009523/animal-crossing-new-leaf-grass-wear) Apparently flowers must be growing on the spot.
* Some have said trees do not promote grass growth. [RainbowStuff reports otherwise.](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakkxny)
* [Habitual runners have reported success laying down rows of patterns as guides until natural paths develop underneath them.](http://www.animalcrossingcommunity.com/Topic/5759871/1/#MessageID64983691) Others have said this doesn't work and that patterns prevent wear (see Updates 1 &amp; 2 below).

Please comment if you have any corrections / corroboration to contribute! Screenshots and sources are very much appreciated; it seems a lot of the information out there's based on hearsay.

---

**Updates**

1. [RainbowStuff reports](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakkxny) that grass stays green or brown beneath patterns
2. [supadoodles and nautiless also report](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/cakm0r6) that patterns prevent grass deterioration. I'm moving that item to the ""hearsay"" section.
3. [super helpful comment from MokshaMilkshake](http://www.reddit.com/r/AnimalCrossing/comments/1gimlg/grass_wear_path_making_in_new_leaf/caksl0m) with some additional details.

So about 5 weeks back I imported a Japanese copy of New Leaf. I played it up until the US version came out when I started fresh there. Haven't really touched my other copy since

Would the /r/animalcrossing community be up for trying something a little different. I would leave my town gates open 10+ hours a day and let you

I would still start public works and such, leave an item at re-tail, take fossils, conversate with the locals, sell turnips. Whatever yall want. 

I'd love to see if the community continues to grow the town

Let me know what yall think of it!

Edit:FC: 4613-6989-4407

 Wow, so if you didn't make the cut, sorry :/ I might clean up my list tomorrow to make room for a few more, but for the most part I'm right at 100.

Well, seemed harmless enough. The parents agreed and let me bring over that one game to keep their kids entertained. The youngest wasn't too interested, and catching bugs without tormenting his brother

Last year I went back home for xmas and attended a party at the house I used to babysit in. Turns out the older brother planted an apple tree in their backyard, seems like Animal Crossing was a pretty big turning point for that family.


TL;DR

They don't have a 3DS to share. 

Earlier we were talking about the 3DS game as they were playing City Folk. She looked through my guide for the game and was in awe

Today, for a really, really good price, and I bought them a point card to get New Leaf. It is downloading on the newly set up 3DS. He's going to give it to her tomorrow, early (anniversary isn't for another two weeks).

And I'm really really excited. I'm gonna have fun helping her start out and see all the new stuff and develop her town. I can't wait for her to visit my town and meet all my villagers. She's going to be so excited. I'm trying to think of presents to buy to give her for her first day, Purple Pumps, Purple Glasses, and Huge Shades!)
