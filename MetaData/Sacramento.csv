I raise this question with genuine concern to fellow Sacramento redditors. 
I have personally witnessed questionable behavior from specific mod/mods such as unwarranted bans from this subreddit and unnecessary comments (""trolling"")
I'm not here to point fingers but I am here to survey opinion and if we are not content then we can and should make a change.
I'm not oblivious to the potential this thread has of getting immediately deleted but I would think our mods should have enough integrity to allow their position to come under speculation. 

Sacramento subreddit

EDIT: My friends, this is our home.
I would like to say thank you to PrivatMunky and Nautis for making an appearance here. I was honestly beginning to think all or most of our mods were gone. The general consensus seems to be there are too many mods for the size of this subreddit AND there are specific mods (withholding names) that have caused some grief. I suggest that we of r/Sacramento take care to communicate with our mods as our mods should take care to communicate with us. In addition

* Removal of Mathewx5000 as a mod – on the grounds of their history of offensive interaction with the community

* Removal of AegisSC as a mod – on the grounds of their public bashing of Sacramento ~~and living outside of Sacramento~~ (**EDIT: AegisSC is still living in Sac- apologies for this inaccuracy**) and complaints of offensive interactions with the community

* Removal of Mods not active in r/Sac in the last week


**We will also be promoting (aka no longer removing) more “fun” things in the sub that are somehow related to Sacramento. This can mean as little as the posters being from/living in Sacramento and thinking others in Sacramento could find it interesting based on their familiarity with Sacramento. We'll enact the following guidelines to be posted in the sidebar for what kinds of posts are preferred:**


1. PLEASE SEARCH before posting! Especially when it's about ""Where are the best..."" kind of links. We have a lot of great advice out there already- make the most of it!

2. We like our news local! Try to keep stuff specific to Sacramento or of interest to other people because they also live in Sacramento

3. Meetups are fun! The more the better! If you don't like a venue

4. We're all about supporting each other! But spammy (pro-business

5. Use the downvote and report buttons for offensive

**A few guidelines Mods will be using regarding banning:** 

1. Users that repeatedly post spammy (see above) material 

2. Users that have been repeatedly reported for derogatory, then banned.

3. Threats of sexual

**PLEASE report things! Mods are people with lives too, we’d love to hear them and help you address them!**

**In closing

So photography is my passion. I have been doing photography and cinematography as a freelance artist for several years. I just opened my first physical location for an actual studio, leaks on windows, repairing broken walls, peeling off wallpaper (so time consuming), peeling old paint, installing new floors, refinishing doors, ceiling repair and plaster repair... we do all the work ourself with no loan

Basically,000. But I entered a contest, 590 contestants total. Winner is determined by public votes. If I could get just a small amount of fellow redditors to toss a vote my way I could actually stand a chance to win. I don't have a sign at all over my business, and the other contestants, some really big established businesses, already have really good signs and signage on their buildings.

If you'd like to help me

He goes into all the details in his video of what happened with his previous landlord,000 citizens in Sacramento, if we can get 6,000 (1.2%) of them to donate $10, our goal will be met, and this amazing place can continue.

""Now, you may ask. The Gamer's Grind is a board game cafe. Not many exist outside of Asia, but the basic idea is thus. The store is broken up into two parts, the coffee shop, and the game shop. (think Barnes and Nobels) You can stop by and get your favorite coffee drinks and be on your way, or you can stop in for a few hours to play on the wall of games. The wall of games is a massive wall of every board game imaginable. You pay the wall fee (currently $5) and get unlimited play time for the day.

""But I'm not really into board games."" 
A valid point, me and a few other in the board game community set up intro weekends at the Gamer's Grind. We invite anyone who is willing to give it a shot to come out and play some games with us.It's a fun, relaxing atmosphere.

""What about my family?""
The Gamer's Grind is the perfect place for family game night. You go to Target, you get to choose a different game every week, or even a few different games on one game night. It gets the family out of the house and you all get to have a good time. Is monopoly your thing? they've got 6 different types of monopoly. 

""But I hate my family.""
Drop the wife and kids off and go to the bar to get a drink. Then have them take a cab home. They get to have a good time

I'm moving to San Jose in a few months and I was trying to find some cool things to do in San Jose. I was kinda disappointed to find how down people were on living there.

 I am still very much an amateur but I am looking into getting some experience photographing people I don't know and learning new things while on a shoot and I can't without some real experience. I want to build a portfolio and what better way than to do so than with fellow REDDITORS!

This service would be TOTALLY FREE FOR YOU!!!! I would send you between 10-15 digital copies that you would be able to print as you wish for personal use.

These images would be mine for commercial use for my website and promotions so if you don't want to be featured on a website this isn't for you. 

I'm looking for families, senior photos, aspiring models even animals anyone of any shape, size, color, orientation!

I can also provide makeup assistance if needed. 

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/yJEsVwX.jpg) is a picture of me if you are worried I'm some creep! 

Just PM me or message me here if you are interested.

* Very quiet and peaceful block yet still close to bars and restaurants
* In unit washer and dryer

* Small
* Nice front porch
* Good water pressure

Cons:

* The acoustic insulation between the two sides of the duplex is not terribly good. You will hear me having sex, which lasts only a finite amount of time)

No more selfies.  But please do take a picture of the chip where you found it.

Today, but it got me thinking that this MUST work for the guy if he's doing it almost an entire year later. 

So I just wanted everyone to know about the guy. If you're naive (like I was)

He's probably 40-45, last time he wasn't. He produced a piece of paper with details about an accident written on it, but it was a KCRA webpage printout that looked like it had seen a lot of miles. I even tried looking for a timestamp, but there wasn't one. 

Just want people to be safe and watch out for themselves. Happy Holidays!

Thanks for the support and great ideas in the [last post about doing something good for our community](http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/xugma/what_do_you_say_we_move_past_all_the_argybargy_in/).  I think we should follow through on them eventually: clothes drive, and others.  

For the time being

**Another fellow redditor I know volunteers at a local non-profit

The more support RAFT gets from the community

There are multiple ways to support RAFT:

* **Donate money** - we can do this through their website and follow up for a total tally of how much our subreddit donated)

* **Donate supplies** -  [RAFT has a wishlist]( http://www.raftsac.org/images/stories/New_Donation_Materials_List_for_RAFT2.pdf) of surplus supplies they ask for from local businesses.  We could organize a meetup to collect some of these common materials and drop them off.

* **Volunteer** - Like I mentioned

If we decide to do any or all three of these options
 
Let me know what you think.  Thanks again!

*Disclaimer:  I’m in no way affiliated with RAFT.  The sac sub voted on supporting local teachers

**EDIT:  Some in the thread have suggested donating supplies directly to a local needy school.  If the community would rather do that

1. Tuesday/7pm/once monthly looks like the most popular selection. Some of you have expressed interest in having a set meeting agenda ahead of time. I will go ahead and write one up as soon as the survey is closed. (It is closing this sunday, so unless there is an upset in survey land we will likely be reading those as our first two books. We will be reading and discussing one complete book per month, with something of an open format for dialogue. (Think socratic seminar minus the debate....... scratch that, I'm sure some of us will have opposing viewpoints.) In my experience, specific discussion questions can be somewhat limiting. Guidelines can be helpful, though, and I would encourage everyone to come prepared with themes in mind for discussion. At the end of each meeting I would like to select the next meeting location(either by discussion and vote or all writing our choice on an index card and drawing from a jar).

* Nationwide Freezer Meats.  Oddly named.

* Squeeze Inn.  Got sued a few years back and ended up expanding into a Sacramento chain.  Unique cheese skirt is a Sacramento legend.

* Burgers &amp; Brew.

* Ford's.  Nice little spot across from William Land Park.

* Crepeville.  Keep hearing about the burger

* Tower Cafe.  Most people complain the food is boring except the burger.

* Jim Denny's.  Itty bitty place with supposedly a lot of heart.  

* Burger Junction.  Sort of out of the way (Florin and Power Inn) but very old school

* [Breakfast with Strangers](http://breakfastwithstrangers.com) 
* [Our video for the project](http://vimeo.com/43216845) 
* [Our Kickstarter Campaign](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We should be in the Sacramento area in mid-December.

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.
Thanks for your consideration

**-Paradise Beach** (by Glen Hall Park) is kind of an alcove, but you can wade out and it's actually a beach.

I'll be posting a little map and some pictures today (as I will be going swimming at Paradise Beach today). I'll also post a couple signs because the beach can be kind of a pain in the ass to get to. If you'd like to go

I'm super excited and I hope to see a lot of people there!! :)

I've included a few links and photos on how to get there, that would be awesome! If not, You're going with me julie_DLT!~~ She does not need a ride. :)

Normally I hand wash my car, got nasty dirty, decided finally to give up and try the ""Touchless"" carwash at that Chevron which was a major mistake.

There are these pressure washers that come down and swing back and forth in front of you car, metal nozzle on paint.  Needless to say, there is a pretty deep gouge in the hood of my car when I get to pull through and take a look to see whats going on, I pull around, park, and go in to speak with the staff about the issue.

Ouch that's a nasty gouge!

[http://i.imgur.com/92S4h.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/92S4h.jpg)

I have never had such horrible customer service, we're talking, big chalky white gouge on a still damp silver hood that catches your nail when you run over it.  I asked for the owners number to take it up with them, so the manager gives me their number, which was actually the number for that Chevron location instead, and tells me to call for ""Pal"" at 8am.  I did ask if they would review the video footage from the car wash, they flat out refused, even though they were the manager!

I call at 8am, they say call in 30 minutes, I call in 30 minutes and get the manager, tell him who I am, he hangs up immediately.

At this point, and tell them I'm going through with the claim, I'll go get some quotes to see if its more than my deductible.  Insurance says they'll go through legal channels and pursue the gas station on my behalf.

Head on down to Hayes Brothers

[http://i.imgur.com/PtlL9.png](http://i.imgur.com/PtlL9.png)

Well

What the FUCK? If these guys had just fessed up and had their insurance sort the problem out, even talk to my insurance company when they called, this wouldn't be such a big issue, but now I'm sure they're looking at getting their balls twisted over it by my insurance who will want to recoup every last cent then some.

This Chevron station is totally horrible, they're well and truly horrible.

I did a bit of research and apparently the new development was tied into the existing water and sewer infrastructure without updating it, and it never would have worked if they were sold.

  I'm moving to Sacramento at the end of July and I am trying to find a place to live.  The hard part is I'll be moving in without visiting. 

The wife and I have decided to live in the Pocket area because of great child care/schools/location etc.  

We originally found a place called Southwood Townhomes but since then I've found some negative things about that place and it is no longer on my radar. 

Now we are looking at Sycamore Terrace

1341936111.0,wbzku,As a proponent of professional sports in Sacramento I've gotta ask...,tman916x,19,4,67,"I was reading an article today about Kevin Johnson's desire for the MLB when I saw a comment that really irked me and simultaneously inspired this post:

**Random derp:** 

""One more example of Kevin Johnson's monumental ego and self absorption it looks like. He is not in it for the People of Sacramento or even the Region around Sacramento but rather for himself, and will cause for all of us.""

**My response:**

""I'm not sure how acquiring a professional sports franchise for the city of Sacramento is reflective of Johnson's ego especially when the grassroots #herewestay, schools, parks, pools, etc. have gotta realize that they do not generate our government the same kind of revenue as having the NBA or MLB here in Sacramento. Having pro sports in town is an investment in more way than one: leasing a city owned arena generates millions annually (which would have been the case with the Kings' rail yard arena), visiting teams have contracts with travel agencies/hotels/security/etc, small/big businesses will benefit from patrons who want to go out for drinks/food before and after games which is essential to our local economy, GM's

When closing the account at the downtown branch I told them that the final balance wasn't right and to check again because I was telling them that they credited for the fraudulent charge twice. The account rep said no, the rep then said that it's correct.

I figured whatever, right? If BOTW can't keep their shit straight (which they by this point have obviously proven they can't) it's not my problem. 

So I get back to the office after taking a longer lunch break than I would have liked and within 10 minutes I get a call telling me that I was given too much when I closed the account and would I be so kind as to come on back to the branch and bring it back.

Within 10 minutes... That's right, but when they screwed up and it'll cost them money, they get right on it.

The mother's description of smelling the body in Glenn Hall Park and following her nose to her daughter's corpse also seems unlikely. That park and those trails are heavily used every day. And yet no people and none of the many offleash dogs noticed the decomposing body?

Dear Maloof Family

I had a dream last night.  It was a really nice dream about Sacramento.  The Kings were still hear, and the Kings were a premiere team. Then I woke up and it saddened me to realize it was only a dream.  But the real sad part is that this dream could so easily be a reality.  And a very soon reality.  

I love the Sacramento Kings.  I like them more than I like the sport of Basketball.  Watching the Kings play is one of my favorite things to do.  But since all this talk about moving, and being a Kings fan is a joke. It truly is embarrassing to say I am a Kings fan.

My only wish is to tell you one thing.  That if you stayed in Sacramento and invested in us, but we are strong.  But only as strong as ownership shows. That's you guys.  If you showed a commitment for the long term future, it would not only bring us back, I would be PROUD again to say I am a Kings Fan.  Figure it out guys, or else you just wasting time.  I know people say you guys don't have money, but you guys own a FUCKING NBA team.  I'd say that's worth quite a lot.  All it will take is your first step.

If this letter ever found you


Sincerely

fan",,t5_2qi09,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Sacramento/comments/14prnq/open_letter_to_the_maloof_family/
