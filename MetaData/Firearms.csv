This is a common and severe misunderstanding of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights. Let me explain.

You have to understand who these documents are speaking to
The Bill of Rights does not grant rights to the people. Those rights, by the people, and for the people.

The second amendment is not speaking to the people, you're allowed to have a gun if you're part of a militia or if you're well regulated or this or that."" No. The second amendment does not grant rights. We already inherently have those rights. Instead, the second amendment speaks to the government and says, ""hey government, the people need guns to be able to form a militia so that they may overthrown you if need be"".

There is no ""you can have a gun if you're in a militia"". It's the other way around. ""Government cannot curtail the rights of the citizens to own guns

There is no ambiguity here, who clearly have never read the Constitution or the Bill of Rights. (That our firearms also allow us to hunt and target shoot and protect our families is a bonus.) Assistant Chief Justice Joseph Story, in the late 1800's, predicted this day when people would forget why that amendment was written, he predicted that people would find it absurd that we would want to be able to overthrow the government, and when that day comes, we are in for some bad times.

**TL;DR:** We don't even need a second amendment. Citizens inherently have the right to own guns. The second amendments speaks clearly to the government that they are never to take our guns away,False,,t5_2ryez,1361986276.0,,,t3_19c5fl

The government has been cutting off electricity to disable WiFi. They've also cut internet access to Twitter/Facebook by extorting some private corporate ISPs through government pressure (so much for free-market AKP).

---
Turkey has no right to bear arms. It has freedom of speech supposedly

Erdogan, arresting many military officials and ex-parliamentarians (opposing parties) for ""coup plots / overthrow plots""--essentially thought crime. They have targeted them based on their political views, not because they have any evidence.

Since the courts, and prime ministership are controlled by the AKP, they don't have to provide any evidence. Just fake some word documents and keep them in jail and in the courts indefinitely.

In Turkey you cannot buy most firearms

Yet the police is militarized and has all sorts of weapons in their arsenal. The police are seen as the loyal arm of Erdogan and because of fears of the secular military

Continue defending your 2nd amendment rights. It's what keeps government accountable. Appreciate that you live in a country where you are allowed all sorts of firearms but definitely ask for more and fight every registry and every ban.

I thought this would interest you all knowing what exactly you are fighting for and what the founding fathers of the US thought about when writing the 2nd amendment. They knew from the Battle of Concord and Lexington that oppressive governments would do anything in their power to silence opposition and guns are the only way for revolution.

**TL;DR:** Defend your 2nd amendment rights, getting beat up no matter how peacefully you protest your rights---and hoping the army will save the day (which has been neutered by the government with hundreds of military officials sitting in jail for progressive political views).

I want to keep this place as close to a direct democracy as possible. I would love to say that the only rule is that there are no rules

If you could reply with a few things that you think should be allowed/disallowed (CP is an example of something that we will delete without hesitation), now is your chance to run them by us. Whatever the community wants, the community gets.

I've had a few requests for moderators. I made RB23 a mod a few months ago (I'm pretty sure I was drunk) as a sort of joke

*Simply tell us to log your view as being against the AWB and against the magazine capacity limitation (if that's your personal view) and we will log you as such. You need to provide your name and mailing address to be entered into the system that the Member of Congress looks at (in most offices).

1361550659.0,190zwj,The long road to my Carry Permit and the conversion of my wife from a hoplophobe to a gun-nut.,FatherVic,197,18,79,"I’ve been married to the most wonderful woman for more than 15 years now.  We have 3 amazing children and despite life’s ups and downs

There has always been one area where we just haven’t agreed in the past and that is the matter of firearms.  Roxy was raised in California around some pretty liberal people who despise guns, she never bought into any of it and grew in her own experiences.  Where guns are concerned, she’s fine with the idea of a well-armed populace and hates attempts to trample the 2nd Amendment.   However, she’s always been a bit hoplophobic and as such I turned my attention from firearms early in our marriage, mostly because I love her more than anything.

Then it happened…
We moved to Tennessee to take a job with a small electronics company.  We sold our house and crammed everything we owned into a Penske and drove to our new (rented) townhome in Murfreesboro

It wasn’t the nicest place.  Sure the townhome was fine

One night

I called my little brother in Kansas City and he shipped his shotgun to a local FFL and I took transfer of it.  My wife and I felt so helpless.  I knew that we were way past due for some protection in the home.  It took this event for my wife to see it the same way.  The year was 2007.

We broke our lease and moved into a nice house toward the north end of town.  We enjoyed peace and prosperity.  I gave my brother back his shotgun and Roxy let me buy a Mosin.  That was 2008.

In 2009

For the next 2 years, and food and supplies were securely stored.

In 2011, and most importantly, unless she could come up with a good reason why not, then it was going to happen anyway.  I received several speeches on “if any of your kids … it’s over ” And “I don’t like it but you’re a big boy”.  So I did.

After much searching, I settled on the Sig Sauer P250 in 9mm.  It was done.  I made every effort to keep the wife calm.  I kept it locked up, unloaded, etc.  Sure it wasn’t an effective weapon locked and unloaded but I was operating on the “baby steps” principle.

Next came getting a carry permit.  Nope.  After several arguments over the course of a year and a half the answer was no.   I respect my wife

I feel I need to note that I couldn’t get her to agree to come shooting with me either.

So since my first purchase in January 2011

The more guns became prevalent, I would drop anything and let them see and handle my firearms.  The more she saw them being completely responsible, the more comfortable she became with the idea of firearms.  In October of 2012, one of her freshly divorced friends started dating a gun nut.  It then became a topic of discussion and before I knew it, I was taking a day off work to take her and her friends to the range.  It was amazing!  She said she had fun, told me which gun was her favorite to shoot (P220 – btw), but told me not to get too excited as it wasn’t really her thing.   And I found out that she is a better shot than me.

Christmas time

Then Sandy Hook and all the media that followed.  She became enraged at attempts by the media and government to vilify gun owners.  Around New Year’s, the topic was 2A and she turned to me and said, “You had better schedule a carry permit class for us.”  

I was floored!  I looked at her and asked her if she knew what she was saying.  Her response was loud and clear

I figured it to be too good to be true

I made our reservations and she received her email confirmation almost immediately.  The conversation went like this:

Roxy: “It says her that I have to bring my gun...”
FatherVic: “No problem
Roxy: “What if I wanted my own gun?”
http://i.qkme.me/3t3ku4.jpg

Again I let that go, she would only be able to get what she could get and not what she wanted but that when this all settles down, I will take her shopping.

Tuesday

Tomorrow is the big day and Monday we plan to turn our paperwork into the state.  It has been a long

I strongly encourage you to come to the capitol tomorrow and make your voices heard. The turnout on Monday was very encouraging; the capitol was completely packed with Second Amendment supporters and we could hear the car horns blaring outside all day long. You can no longer testify on the bills

If you can’t make it to the capitol

Contact your state senator immediately and tell them to vote “no” on these bills. You can find your local legislators here: http://votesmart.org/. Your legislators’ contact information can be found at http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/Directory?openFrameset for the House and http://www.leg.state.co.us/CLICS/CLICS2013A/csl.nsf/DirectorySen?openframeset for the Senate. In addition to voicing your opinions

The bad news is that the majority party supports these bills. The good news is that not all senate democrats are completely behind the gun bills.  Below is a list of democrat legislators the Denver Post has stated could be swayed to vote “no”:
 
Angela Giron
303-866-4878
angela.giron.senate@state.co.us
 
Cheri Jahn
303-866-4856
cheri.jahn.senate@state.co.us

303-866-4871
gail.schwartz.senate@state.co.us
 
Linda Newell
303-866-4846
linda.newell.senate@gmail.com
 
We need only three votes to shoot the bills down.
Don’t get discouraged. We’ve already made waves so large they’re impossible for the gun grabbers to ignore. Let’s remind these legislators that they were not elected to advance a political ideology; they were elected to represent their constituents.
 
Sincerely
Senator Greg Brophy

No

These things are too ineffective.  We should reduce the amount of alcohol content in a given volume of liquid. I know you like 4-5% in beer but that is too much for you.  How about .5%? Oh and no more hard liquor!  That is FAR too dangerous for you...

&gt; Suicide is the leading cause of death among gun owners in the initial years of acquisition.

Well

&gt; Out of 395 fatalities occurring at a family home where a gun was present, while only nine were shootings of an intruder.

This study comes from one private survey conducted in the 80s in the greater Seattle, and as such the numbers presented don't come anywhere close to any national surveys or estimates. It's also worth noting that Washington's suicide rate is higher than the national average, though not by much ([source](http://www.suicide.org/suicide-statistics.html)).

And now

&gt; Presence of a firearm in the home reportedly results in death or injury to household members or visitors over 12 times more often than to an intruder.

[This](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10516848) is the only source used to bring up that figure. It's another editorial article written by a medical chairman who has spent years writing polarizing articles on gun crime and drawing tons of criticism for his poor methods of data presentation. [His wiki page.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Kellermann)

**TL;DR:**

&gt; When faced with a home robbery, and your risk of successful suicide triples.

According to a Senate source speaking to CNN, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Sen. Dean Heller (NV).

“Joe Manchin called me yesterday. He thinks he has a couple more votes. The one senator, man has she been hit hard,” Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) said in an interview with The Las Vegas Review Journal this past weekend, via an advance portion released to the The Huffington Post. He continued, “She’s the only senator in the northeast to vote against background checks. She went from a hugely positive number in New Hampshire — her negatives now outweigh her positives. She is being hit every place she goes. So we are going to pick up some more votes. I may be able to get another Democrat or two. That would get us up to 57. We may only need three additional Republicans. So we’ll see.”

Senators Joe Manchin (D-WV) and Pat Toomey (R-PA) co-sponsored the background checks bill that has between 85-90% support from the public according to various polls. At least five senators who voted no on the first vote are facing severe backlash, Mark Begich (D-AK), Rob Portman (R-OH), and Dean Heller (R-NV). The vote was 54-46, and fell 5 short (6, technically, but Reid’s vote was a procedural vote) of passing.

Dems aren’t naming names

There were four red state Senate Dems who voted no, Begich, and Heitkamp. Four Republicans joined the majority of Democrats in opposing the NRA with Republican Senators Collins, Kirk, McCain, and Toomey voting for the bill. Red state Democrat Mary Landrieu took the risk to vote her conscience in spite of the political risk, voting yes on the bill.

According to a Senate source speaking to CNN , Sen. Lisa Murkowski (AK) and Sen. Dean Heller (NV). Basically, these flippers require one sentence to be changed in the bill in order to save face for their previous no vote.

Any bill that passes the Senate still has to work its way to even getting put up for a vote in the dysfunctional Republican House of Representatives

Reid did not indicate how the next vote would be presented, saying that they were too afraid to appear to be “helping” the President.

Where I go to church, commenting about the unsavory location of the park.

We got there, at most 100x100 yards, give or take.  There was a large family in the other pavilion having a birthday party with a bounce castle for their 4 year old.  Their music was pretty loud, but no one really cared.  Some of their group were congregating near an entrance to the park off of a dead-end street.  There, a group of ""local ne'er-do-wells"" had gathered to loiter.

My 2 sons were playing futbol and my daughter was at the playground with a bunch of other kids when we heard the popping of gunfire.  At first, but what are you going to do?).  I moved my hand to my firearm that I carry at about 1 o'clock and assessed the situation.

The gunfire was in the parking lot between a group of about 3-4 ""people"" (quotes because they are gang-banger scum which actually defines them as mindless animals) - it was not directed at our position.  I knew that if they came this way

I looked to my wife, I found 20 kids and a few adults, trying to calm them down.  My children were flat on the ground, crying.  I motioned for them to get behind me.  I dialed 911 and found that they had already been contacted.  By this time, the gunfire had stopped.

People started to stir and my friend told them to stay put

After about 8 or 9 minutes, after making sure everyone in our party was safely out of there, my family and I left.

Here's the deal...

I was certainly scared, calm.  I kept my cool and as a result was able to assess the situation for myself and my family.  I had the appropriate tools to deal with the situation should it have come my friend's or family's way.

This is why it is so important that we be allowed to keep and bear arms.  The world is dangerous and getting more so every day.  The police were no help.  I was the last line of defense.  I'm just glad it didn't come to it.


**EDIT**

[Here is the park](http://goo.gl/maps/nnSCR).  Shooting happened along the north side of the parking lot.  It started at the northwest corner of the soccer field and moved to the parking lot.  We were at the smaller pavilion.

It turns out that, when included in an article describing the violence, hatred and murder that todays media is obsessed with, it's easy to connect that term with malicious intent. However, that would not be entirely accurate. The term ""firearm-related death"" means exactly that. It is any death that is related in any way to the use of a firearm and, in addition to homicide, also includes accidental death and suicide.

What difference does that make, if you remove the number of suicides &amp; unintentionals from that figure, it drops to 2.98 (in '09). 

Here is why that matters. Gun control advocates say that tighter laws will make it harder for a bad guy to shoot a good guy, is not as drastic as murder (except in murder/suicide cases, of course). Homicide shows an intensely malicious intent towards another human, one that suicide does not typically reflect. This is why making the distinction between those two figures is important when using those stats in a case for gun control. 

By all this I am not suggesting that there is not a problem nor that 2.98 is a number to brag about (far from it!). I am also not in any way making light of the number of suicides in this country. What I am saying is that if we actually want to put the brakes on violence and the needless loss of human life in our society

About two weeks before the Aurora theatre shooting, I can attest to it's strict stance on gun control, but all the gun laws in the world would not have stopped that young man from getting stabbed.

As it's been said, thieves...we have a name from them: lawbreakers. In my opinion, if there is a problem, it is not on a legal level but societal.

And the answer

I don't mean legally or morally, be a major inconvenience to law-abiding citizens.  At worst, it will cause more violence and death than all the mass shooting attacks in recorded history.  What it *won't* do is make anybody any safer.  The gun genie is out of the bottle in the US, and there is no legislating around that fact.

There are, there would be no way to find and recover those couple-hundred-million newly illegal firearms.

Oh sure, regardless of what ""the man"" says?  There are states that are seriously considering seceding from the union over *health care* - what do you expect to happen when the government that they already distrust tries to forcibly disarm them?

Even if by some miracle you managed to remove 99% of all civilian-owned guns in the US without violence, exclusively in the hands of people with no regard for the law.  All the people who would be most likely to use a gun to commit a crime *will still have their guns*.  Nearly all of those people aren't allowed to possess firearms now, what do you think will change then?  At best, crime will remain constant.  An argument could probably be made that it might even go up.

OK, nobody started a civil war over it.

Well, threw more than a few otherwise-law-abiding people in jail for technical infractions, and drove the cost of pre-ban guns and parts through the roof, but it didn't make anybody any safer.  There is nobody alive today who wouldn't have been if the ban had not been in place for a decade.

So maybe this time it's a little stricter?  Maybe no grandfathering in pre-ban guns and parts?

That just pushes you closer to the first option of violent resistance.  As I initially stated, do nothing.  There is no gun-crime reduction to be had that wouldn't come at the cost of massively larger anti-control violence.  There are too many guns in circulation, and too pervasive a gun culture in much of the country.  From a purely logical, rational standpoint, gun control as it is being pushed now is a *really* bad idea that cannot possibly benefit society.

So the next time you engage someone on the other side in a debate (probably in the next five minutes, it is truly horrible what happened in CT last week and it probably wouldn't have been nearly as bad if he didn't have guns.  Yes, you like guns and you feel you are entitled to own them.  Yes, the other guy is always wrong.  But none of that matters.  **It is not possible to disarm American civilians.**  You can make guns every bit as illegal as drugs, and they'll remain just as accessible as drugs (to criminals, at least) for exactly the same reasons.  We don't even need to debate whether or not we *should*, because no matter what

Instead, but we can sure as hell reduce the chance that they might snap in the first place.

1.  The chances of Feinstein's bill making it out of committee is slim to none. It's too politically toxic

2. Feinstein's bill is sucking all the air out of the debate by being the big bad scary thing we have to defeat. It's worth noting some smaller bills focusing on magazine restrictions, were proposed earlier or basically at the same time as Feinstein's bill. 

3. Democrats in insecure seats could get crushed in 2014-16 on gun legislation

4. When Feinstein's bill tanks

Joe Biden gave the game away when he acknowledged that ""assault weapons"" aren't responsible for the majority of gun crime.  If this whole thing was really about banning modern sporting rifles, and Reid might not even let it get that far.

Here's the worst part: the smaller bills aren't enough to warrant tossing out Republicans in secure seats in favor of more gun-friendly candidates

So since Republicans won't throw out *mostly* gun friendly but duplicitous Republican senators

Republicans get to say they killed the big bad AWB, took down Feinstein, and secured memberships and donations for years.  They even get more nasty DemocRat strawmen to fight for another decade and raise money to defeat (ineffectually I might add, the NRA-supported candidates got *hosed*).

Everybody wins

Turns out there was a big interest in it. I've been taking groups of 3 shooters out. Today was the second group. 

I required them to memorize the 4 rules of gun safety

We had a lot of guns to shoot. SW Model 34 in .22LR, Ruger Security Six, Glock 19, Beretta M92FS, Mosin Nagant 91/30 ('28 Tula),  Stevens side by side 20ga. Glenfield 25 and an M+M M10.

I had all the .22LR that we could shoot (I have an ammo can that's 1/4 filled with it)

Despite the shitty weather and frozen feet

I did it in conjunction with a friend of mine and redditor who I won't name. He did an excellent job at sharing his guns and ammo

I think that introducing new people to the sport is just as important as calling our reps. A lot of people simply don't have any friends or family that shoot. They have no exposure to our hobby and lifestyle. They hear these ""common sense"" proposals and wonder why ""gun nuts"" are being so offended by it. These people get bombarded by the media

One of the guys that came said that he's been shooting with his friends before at a farm and was just blown away at how safety conscious we were being compared to the other time he went.

I do not think anyone has actually attempted to provide a history of small-arms development

There are a few points I would like to make to hopefully educate some of those that are unfamiliar with small-arms history. 

* **An overview and timeline of how modern firearms have developed.**


* **The United States has a history of modern firearms readily available to civilians.**


 **Overview of Small-arms Development since 1770**

**1775-ish**
The Continental Army was armed with a hodge-podge of rifles and muskets in 1775. The difference between the two was that a musket consisted of a tube (barrel) that took a loosely fitting ball and fired it innaccurately, where the term 'rifle' comes from). The rifle was more accurate than the musket, and allowed rifleman to target individual soldiers or officers with a reasonable degree of sucess; However, it was faster to load and fire a smoothbore musket, and could be fired for a longer period of time in a prolonged battle. (Blackpowder leaves a residue in the barrel that would build up in rifles/muskets, and make it difficult to stuff the ball down the barrel.) Basically, a rifle was more useful at longer distances, you would have probably been better off with a musket.

**Civil War**
Let's fast-forward to the American Civil War. There are a few things we need to cover. The [Minie Ball](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minie_Ball), [repeating rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spencer_repeating_rifle), and [revolving pistols](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revolver).

The Minie Ball was a football shaped projectile that worked very well in rifles, and in any weather. Percusion caps provided much more instaneous ignition of the black-powder, and did away with the very large flash-fire that was near a persons eye when they were firing. Accurate rifle fire was now posible out to 1000 yards, and ""sharpshooting"" began to take much more notoriety during the Civil War.

Metal cartidges allowed firearms to be loaded even quicker than muzzle-loading rifles, it was not uncommon for a solider to forget to remove the old percussion cap on the nipple of his rifle, and put a new one on; as a result, a soldier would put new powder and bullet on top of the old one, and if they did this a few times, and then remembered to put a cap on, it could blow the rifle up! Metal cartridges and single-shot rifles simplified the loading process to simply putting a cartridge in, and pulling the trigger. Another advantage that metal cartidge cases provides was allowing the soldier to load and fire from a prone (laying down) position instead of kneeling or standing to load the rifle; it may not seem like much

Repeating rifles like the Spencer rifle (the one in the link) allowed soldiers to fire more shots before having to reload, and a revolver would have given him another 6 (or 12 if he had two), as well as a saber that was effective at close range or off horseback. With this kind of firepower at their disposal, a calvary unit could flank, and quickly subdue a much larger fighting force armed with muzzle loading rifles.

Following the Civil War, the utility of each was dependent upon the situation; one of the many reasons that Custer was over-run at the Battle of the Little Big Horn was because the Sioux had some lever-action repeating rifles, and were able to close the distance between them and the 7th Calvary, and exploit their close range firepower.

**World War I**
The time between the Civil War and World War I saw more improvements in firearms; the development of [smokeless powder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smokeless_powder) that could drive bullets faster than blackpowder, [automatic rifles](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_rifle), and [submachine guns](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Submachine_gun)

Smokless powder greatly reduced the smoke signature that a soldier produced when firing his rifle; it also pushed bullets a lot faster than blackpowder in a smaller package, allowed rifles to be even more effective at longer ranges.

Bolt-action repeating rifles like the [Gewhr 98](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gewehr_98#M_98_controlled-feed_bolt-action_system) that could fire the new cartridges that were much more effective at longer-ranges

Machine guns like the [Maxim gun](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxim_gun) that fired the newer cartridges made it much easier for entrenched armies to hold ground against infantry and calvary charges; when coupled with a knowledge of trajectories (the arc the bullet flies)

Much of the focus during World War I was trying to find ways to overcome the stalemate that machine guns, efforts were focused on developing weapons that allowed infantry to gain ground again;  light machine guns, automatic rifles, and submachine guns, guns were developed in an effort to allow infantry to gain and hold ground again. 

Light machine guns were simply designed to be mobile machine guns

Automatic rifles were typically fed by a detachable magazine, and fire a shot every time the left foot struck the ground, and create a wall of lead that would kill the germans...needless to say, it was not a very good idea. As a result, the automatic rifles were used much in the same way a light-machine gun would be; to bring an increased amount of firepower against the enemy, and allow rifleman to advance.

Submachine guns fired a pistol cartridge out of a detachable magazine

It would not be until World War II that they would their worth when coupled with tanks

**World War II**

World War II was fought with much of the same technology as the First World War, and tanks could be massed at a single point, and then punch through a defensive line, surround it, and cut off it's supplies.

Most of Europe went to war with the same bolt-action rifles it had carried in World War I, and automatic rifles. Infantry tactics were focused on how to strike a balance between short-range firepower and long range accuracy, as well as having the foot soliders be able to keep up with and support the tanks.

The United States entered World War II with the [M1 Garand](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand) which was a semi-automatic rifle that increased the firepower of the infantry rifleman without having to sacrifice the range or accuracy of a bolt-action rifle. Towards the end of the War

The most notable firearms advance came in the form of the Assault Rifle. The idea behind the Assault Rifle was to combine all of the best aspects of a submachine gun, and develop a weapon that was more suitable for fast-paced warfare. The German [FG42](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FG42) was an early attempt at an Assault rifle, but was not much more useful than a semi-automatic rifle because it used a full-power rifle cartridge which has too much recoil to be effective in a lightweight rifle. 

The next attempt at an assault rifle (and where the namesake comes from) was the Stg.44; the Stg.44 has all of the hallmarks of what makes an assault rifle an assault rifle; it was select fire, so it could be fired semi-automatic (one shot at a time) or full-auto (bunches of shots per trigger pull). Basically, the Assault Rifle sacrificed the extreme-range of the full powered rifle cartridge for some of the short range utility of the submachine gun; it was intended to be a much more useful weapon in a mobile war where accurate long range rifle fire was not as useful.

**Vietnam**

The United States fought the Korean War was fought with the same firearms that were used in World War II; it would not be until Vietnam that the United States would have a real Assault Rifle.

Following World War II, but also wanted something in a rifle-sized package that could be used as an automatic rifle, rifle, and submachine gun. The full powered rifle cartridge made it uncontrollable in full-automatic fire, and as a result, it was really only an adequate replacement for the semi-automatic M1 Garand rifle.

The [M16 rifle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M16_rifle) is the only true assault rifle adopted by the United States

Except for some major snafus (the rifle was hastily adopted

**Vietnam-Now**

Following Korean War, there has been a reversal of that trend on some levels; the intermediate cartridge that the M16 fires is not very useful for long range engagements. In the mountains of Afghanistan, this has became fairly apparent, and rifles have been issued to fill the long-range engagement niche. Even the discarded M14 rifles saw a comeback as a Designated Marksman rifle.

The main advancement in the infantry soldiers area has came in the form of rugged telescopic sights

Here's the new legislation that I would like to see presented:

* A National CCW permit with adequate funding for purpose-built training standards

* A fixed price for receiving the training.

* Strict confidentiality standards surrounding the permit database

* Opt-in at a state level. Restrictive states can choose not to take part in the program

* Total reciprocity for all states that opt-in.

I believe in the full wording of the Second Amendment. I believe that the framers envisioned a nation of trained and armed civilians

""Well regulated

If the goal of new firearm policies is indeed to improve public safety

American civilian gun owners are facing a PR predicament today. 

Why is the common urban voter who has no knowledge of guns generally comfortable with ""ex-military"" or ""retired cops"" being armed

Because legitimacy comes along with training. Soldiers and police officers are known to receive formal firearms training. To the average layman

All civilian shooters should be able to attain some measure of the same credibility. A National CC Permit has the potential to offer just that.

In other words

Just wondering if others have had similar thoughts.

**Edit:** 

*The response to this post has been interesting to me. It's obvious that a majority of 2A supporters are instantly adverse to anything involving gun rights and the Federal government. My perspective is that the Federal government is the source of most of the firearm restrictions that affect gun owners

*What I'm discussing here isn't Federally ""enforced"" carry permits

*The flaw I perceive in the current system is simply that there is no set of standards for training and licensing among the majority of states that require proof of training in order to receive a CC permit.*

*My ideal scenario would simply be the creation of a training curriculum that could be recognized across state lines. Federal funding would be logical,,False,,t5_2ryez,1359733395.0,,True

Do you and your representatives believe that the government is the only entity sanctioned to commit violence.  It is my belief that the 2nd amendment has established that individuals also carry that right and is at the heart of it's inclusion.

Why do police enjoy that privilege and no one else?  Is it the oath? Training?  Can citizens who take the oath and complete the training get that same power?

We (government) have decided that some of us get guns and are allowed to carry them and allowed to kill people.  We've even said they can kill people under circumstances not allowed by others.  We need to break down that argument to it's basic premise.

this myth has repeatedly been debunked but bears repeating. The 1st, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th  and part of the 10th amendments all enumerate natural rights for individuals. 

Why then would the 2nd amendment alone be a right for the govt ? The SCOTUS agrees and has ruled that the right to bear arms is an individual right. 

James Madison who drafted the BoR wrote tens of dozens of times that the militia is the ""body of the people"" composed of able bodied persons owning personal weapons. 

The historic context and intent of the persons who wrote it are clearly protecting an individual right.


myth 2: that the second amendment protects hunters and other sporting uses but not military style weapons. 


the historic context of the second amendment has no basis in hunting or sporting uses. those uses are never mentioned whatsoever. 

the bill of rights is a political document and the 2nd amendment

Defense of the nation cannot be done with antiquated weaponry. a citizen was expected to have a modern rifle kept in good condition and ready to be called to arms. 

myth 3: that the government with its insane amount of military power could stomp the citizenry and therefore the 2nd amendment is outdated

the members of our military, uncles, dads, friends and friends of friends. 

to think that a majority of these people would participate in the highly illegal act of attacking its own populace in any kind of real numbers is ludicrous. 

the American people are unlike any other people currently on this earth. our sense of national pride is only dwarfed by our sense of individual liberty and mistrust of government. 

There may be some military members who participate is slaughtering their fellow man, who have any idea how any kind of scenario like this would play out. 

The flip side of this myth is the idea that

the idea that

**this argument is an argument for LESS FEDERAL MILITARY

Our founding fathers did not want us to have anything like the type of federal military power that we have today. it is an agent of citizen suppression in the wrong hands.


myth 4: that gun violence and mass killings are on the rise. 

the numbers simply don't support this assertion and in fact show a downward decline over the last few decades.


myth 5: that reducing the size of large magazines to only hold 10 will alter a killer's ability to kill a lot of people.


a magazine for any handgun or rifle can be changed in less than 2 seconds. the idea that slightly slowing down the amount of firepower that is coming out of a gun will create less destruction has no basis in science when it has been shown that repeatedly

only an armed citizen or officer of the law responding to a criminal can effectively stop someone from continuing to kill. 

if magazines with a capacity over 10 or even affixed to a firearm is a limitation placed on law abiding citizens

A criminal can simply modify a ten round magazine to hold 15, rendering the law impotent.


myth 6: that gun owners are rednecks


millions upon millions of members of all political parties enjoy the personal freedom afforded to them by natural right and enumerated in the Constitution. 

it is estimated that over 40% of the people

Firearms are an American tradition that most nations on this earth do not have or have under extreme restrictions limiting them to sporting uses only


Calling a 2nd amendment supporter a nutter is like saying people who participate in free speech should be labeled seditionists. 

It is frightening that practicing a protected natural right is criticized while maintaining blind faith in govt that has proven time and time again to overstep its powers is encouraged. 

If you don’t trust the govt to truly look out for your rights and interests as so many people in polls believe


Why would you advocate that an untrustworthy govt be given the power to strip you of such an important freedom that
helps keep it in check ?

myth 7: that the government of the united states would never attack or send in military against its own people and therefore
the second amendment is pointless. that we are in some type of ""enlightened"" era where guns are not compatible with modern societies. 

Waco, Egypt, Syria. 

Please go watch the news and realize that the federal govt has overstepped its powers so egregiously over the years that we now accept the Patriot Act

The  Govt of the United States of America has superseded and extended its powers way beyond the original mandate and while it may continue to be benevolent and working for the good of the people now

These rifles are built on Polish underfolder kits and built on a NoDak spud receiver. I've handled tons of these rifles and you wouldn't believe it came from Century Arms. Receiver is 1.5mm thick and fit and finish is excellent. Non-chrome lined barrel for accuracy but I would avoid corrosive ammo. Great buy also. These can be had at about $600 sometimes less. These are drying up.

[Century Arms PAP M70](http://www.riflegear.com/images/Product/medium/1632.jpg)
These are heavy duty AK's built on RPK receivers. Slightly thicker barrel, but heavy, AK's. These rifles lack a rear tang so you cannot change your buttstock. You can get these for $650-750.

[ATI AT-47](http://www.maverick.thegunsource.com/DisplayPic.aspx?PIC=420374)
These are beautiful rifles with very, it's a great buy. They make these in two configurations, milled and stamped. The milled is complete garbage. It's held together with screws and it's a weird milled/stamped hybrid. The stamped version is your stand AK that is held with rivets. I own one of these and it's a great barrel. They claim that they are outfitted with a Shaw match grade barrel. The stamped version can be had for as little has $450 but sometimes go up to $600. The milled go from $600 and up.

There's more out there from small manufacturers and online retailers

Legislators can be contacted [here](http://www.capwiz.com/nra/state/main/?state=nv&amp;view=myofficials)

On the flip side there are some very good bills to support:

* [SB226](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Reports/history.cfm?DocumentType=2&amp;BillNo=226) would eliminate local restrictions on gun owners

* [SB137](https://nelis.leg.state.nv.us/77th2013/App#/77th2013/Bill/Overview/SB137) would make Nevada a ""Constitutional Carry"" state.

* [SB223](https://nelis.leg.state.nv.us/77th2013/App#/77th2013/Bill/Overview/SB223) would allow employees at public colleges and K-12 schools who hold a valid CCW to carry on campus to protect their students.

* [AB340](http://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/77th2013/Reports/history.cfm?DocumentType=1&amp;BillNo=340) would also require uniform application of gun laws by eliminated local restrictions.

1.  Logical.  People think it will work like car insurance, all possible victims would have to carry insurance, not just firearm owners, i.e. every single person in the nation.  That can't work.

2.  Privacy.  Firearm insurance carries along with it an assumption of two things: universal registration and lifecycle management by the state

3.  Racism.  An insurance scheme carried out by the free market would be inherently regressive, then we can see that impoverished areas would ""lose"" their 2nd Amendment rights well before the wealthy areas.  In any large city in the nation that means that minorities would be affected first.  It would be funny, however, to see the ACLU lobbying for firearm insurance subsidies for the poor.

The text is also below because I assume most people would prefer to just read it here. It seems a lot of people have been asking about it

---

The amendment to expand background checks failed yesterday. It seems a lot of people are very upset with this

**1. Do you know what the current laws are for background checks?**

**2. Do you know what the amendment to expand background checks says?**

I would imagine that most people cannot answer those two questions.

The biggest issue I see is that people don't know what the current laws are regarding background checks. The media is throwing around so much misinformation about it though

* **You can buy a gun over the internet without a background check.**

Well you can... until you go to pick it up. You can go to a website selling guns, you don't get the gun. You cannot ship a gun to your door.

There is an exception to this, pass background checks and pay money for forms. All of this grants a person the ability to have firearms, only those classified as C&amp;R firearms, shipped to their door. All of these firearms have to be at least 50 years old and classified as a C&amp;R firearm. These firearms do not include replicas.  Generally, these are not the type of people you have to worry about committing crimes.

* **You can walk into Walmart and buy a gun without a background check.**

This is just wrong. Any business that wants to sell firearms needs to have an FFL. Any company or person with an FFL who is selling a firearm to another person must go through a background check. There are two exemptions to this. In a state like Texas

* **The ""gun show loophole"" lets people buy guns without a background check.**

If we look above we can see that any business with an FFL has to do a background check when selling items. This includes being at a gun show. So what is this ""gun show loophole""? It's if you and I were to meet at a gun show and you wanted to buy a gun from me. I could sell you the gun without a background check. Why? Because it's a private sale between two citizens. This is only true if we are from the same state. I cannot go to an out-of- state gun show and sell another person a firearm. I would need to go through a dealer with an FFL and, this requires a background check. So the ""gun show loophole"" isn't a loophole at all, it's just one citizen selling an item to another.

* **People are privately selling firearms to criminals.**

One person can sell any firearm that they own personally to any other person who they believe is not a felon. As stated above, for any reason at all, can choose not to sell a firearm to any other person.

-   -   -   -   -   -   -

So then what would these expanded background checks cover? [This link](http://www.toomey.senate.gov/?p=press_release&amp;id=965) is to a summary of the bill.

* **Improves the National Instant Criminal Background Checks System (NICS).**

This is the current biggest downfall of the background check system. This does in fact need to be improved upon

* **Require background checks for all firearm sales.**

This is a really good idea... in theory. If we look at the current laws, and one of the biggest attractions of a private sale is that they are generally cheaper, due to it being a used item. Because of this, people would just completely ignore the law, and there would be no way to prove that they were. A law that cannot be enforced is not a good law. A law that only makes it harder on people obeying the law is not a good law.

The only way to hopefully enforce it properly is with a national registry, so the cost would definitely be too much for us. The current NICS system also does not have enough resources, so how would the USA have enough resources to run a registry?

I've heard people say ""this may not be the answer, is a terrible thought process and an even worse way to go about handling laws. If something will not work properly as a law, then it needs to be improved. Until then, forcing something through just to say ""we tried"" is only going to make things worse.

**In summary:**

- Can background checks be improved? Yes.

- Was this amendment the correct way to do that? No.

1348531281.0,10f5yu,Tips for hitting a target... any target... that helped me... and may help you...,Septimius,82,19,14,"The tips I listed below are ones that a LOT of the good people here in /r/firearms have contributed to one of my threads. I was able to apply some

Granted, I would be lucky if I hit the darn thing from 3 feet!

A lot of these tips are probably common knowledge to the more experienced of firearm owners, hope that's ok...

Anyways, here is what I learned:

*  Dry Firing

*  If you're shooting a semi-automatic chamber a round, then fire on an empty chamber and see where the gun goes (or hopefully doesn't). Re-insert the magazine and repeat. 

* Shoot at a blank piece of paper not a target. You brain will pick a point of aim for you. Once you're getting a group that'd fit inside the outline of a CD at 5 yards, 20 yards. Once you can shoot consistent groups you can worry about point of aim.

* Snap Caps

* Check your eye dominance also. I'm right handed but left eye dominant.

* a session or two with a professional firearms instructor.

* A helpful dry fire drill to reduce flinch and smooth out that trigger pull is to place a penny on top of your slide and dry fire until you can do it without the penny falling off. Once you can do that

* ...firearms class had me shooting at 3 feet to start. No joke. Pistol shooting stays exactly the same no matter what reasonable distance you are shooting. If you cant put 12/12 inside the circle at 3 feet then your errors will only be multiplied as you move out. I just put the target at 3 feet until I could put 12/12 in the inside circle twice in a row

* learn how to breathe through mouth out through nose and pull the trigger steadily and slowly.

* Get a pair of cheap glasses, so that you can see NOTHING through them. Black tape is important. Then, on the lens that matches your dominate hand, poke a tiny, tiny, TINY hole in the black tape. Start small, eye of a needle small. You want to just barely be able to see the target when you put the glasses on. This may take some experimentation.

* Shooting is about consistency and repetition. I would recommend starting close to your target and ignore where the rounds are hitting the paper, miss, adjust, miss, adjust, and they end up chasing themselves because they over adjust and it is a constant struggle. You have to really be aware of what you are doing to be able to fix it. Take it slow, don't be in a rush

* It's mostly about the stance

* Practice, and after that... even more Practice.

* Also if you have something with a rail you can mount a laser and this will help you see what your trigger pull is doing when dry firing.

We may have one of the highest costs of living up here but being a heavily rural state we understand the right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

Coming up in our latest session:

* [HB24](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=HB24): Stregthens right for self defense to include ""any place the person has the right to be"".
* [HB69](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=HB69): ""..providing criminal penalties for federal officials who enforce or attempt to enforce a federal law, or order regulating certain firearms and firearm accessories in this state"".  This one is powerful in scope and also stregthens the already passed [Firearms Freedom Act of 2010](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill_text.asp?hsid=HB0186D&amp;session=26) allowing for in-state creation of previously NFA banned firearms.  It received opposition from our legislative legal review in committee recently though.
* [HJR4](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=HJR4): Another symbolic bill sending a message to the US executive letting them know we don't support further infringement on our rights.
* [SJR6](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=SJR6): Same thing as above for our senate.
* [SB11](http://www.legis.state.ak.us/basis/get_bill.asp?session=28&amp;bill=SB11) Allows for citizens over 18 to ""..Manufacture

Alaska's stance on firearms is already very strong and our current 90 day session shows some good progress in reaffirming our state constitutional right to keep and bear arms.  Our constitution was amended in 1994 to include: ""The individual right to keep and bear arms shall not be denied or infringed by the State or a political subdivision of the State."".  At least our legislative branch up here seems to ""get it"".

The last week of April I purchased a new Taurus PT-138 PRO from an online seller. A week or so later it was transferred to me by a local FFL holder. A few days after that I took it to the range (cleaned and oiled first) and experienced a number of failures to fire. Gun goes click

I put several hundred rounds through it hoping it would wear in and sort itself out

I paid to ship it to Taurus a second time and managed to get through to someone there who identified himself to me as Christian

I'm pissed now so I call them back and at least they agree to pay the shipping to send it back for the third time. I am most specific in telling their customer service representatives that I do not want the same weapon back because it is defective and two repair attempts have failed. I want what I paid for...a new firearm with zero defects. I asked to speak to a manager and was told that I would get a call back. The call never came. I called back and reiterated that I want to speak to someone in management about replacing, the call never came so I didn't know where we stood.

This morning FedEx came to my door with a package I was not expecting from, I'm sorry that I bought one of their products and it will never happen again. Had I researched better I probably wouldn't have purchased this one, as this is by no means the first Taurus quality rant to appear on the internet. Just think...for another hundred bucks I could have had a Beretta. Lesson learned.

tldr: Don't buy a Taurus

1357955074.0,16exmh,"The ""FIRE"" in a crowded theater argument",pricecw,73,16,12,"Hey all
   
  Went to a town hall meeting with my Senator this last week, and I was pulled to ask the very first question in the room.  So I asked him about his stance on the proposals to violate American civil rights with the proposed bills, and then got to follow up once.  Responses from him did not give me good feelings, and it appears I will be searching for candidates in upcoming elections. 
    
Anyway, just look at the 1st and yelling ""FIRE"" in a crowded theater.  I talked to a friend afterwords, that had never heard why I think that is BS, so I thought I would share.   
    
The government is not restricting free speech or the first amendment here.  If they wanted to do that (along the lines of gun control)
   
Instead, you would probably be escorted out, and maybe charged with attempting to incite panic.  If you got a panic to happen, someone was trampled to death, and there was no fire, you would be charged with manslaughter/murder.  Now, if there was a fire, and no charge.   
    
Basically, the government should follow the same, if you shoot someone, you get charged, if not, you are OK.

man put under 72-hour psychiatric observation when it was
found he owned 100 guns and allegedly had (by rough
estimate) 1-million rounds of ammunition stored in his home.
The house also featured a secret escape tunnel.

&gt;My favorite quote from the dimwit television reporter: ""Wow!
He has about a million machine gun bullets."" The headline
referred to it as a ""massive weapons cache.""

&gt;By southern California standards someone even owning 100
rounds would be called ""mentally unstable."" Just imagine if
he lived elsewhere:

they'd probably reserve judgment until they made sure that
he had a corresponding quantity of stored food.

Thanks to all of you for taking the time to write to me about an emotionally charged issue, and I wanted to reach out to as many of my constituents as possible before I vote.  I will do my best to concisely address the concerns I have heard from you all, and I must say, I am truly thankful for the kind and respectful discourse we have been able to have.  

I think it is important for citizens to know how I look at every piece of legislation that comes before me regardless of the issue.  First of all, as you all know, the devil is in the details on any policy or legislation that is passed, so I look carefully to anticipate any unintended consequences.  It is my job to look deeply and thoroughly and to talk with experts on each issue.  I spend a lot of time researching and talking with people in my district.  Finally, I painstakingly look to see how the policy can be enforced.  If you can't enforce it, then we probably should not pass it.

I would like to share my thoughts and positions on the bills that I have looked at so far.  Please keep in mind that at the time of this writing I have yet to hear debate on these bills as they have not come to any of the committees I serve on.  First of all, the fees were not reinstated and now the cost is being subsidized by taxpayers.  

HB13-1224, my previous concerns about the enforceability of the law weigh on me quite heavily.  There is no way to distinguish between who would own these magazines legally versus those who bought them illegally. I feel that this legislation would be punishing those citizens who bought them before the ban, or possibly inherited them, while at the same time allowing people to simply drive them across the border from another state.   I always look for unintended consequences and I think this bill is flawed.

HB 13-1229

HB 13-1226, after all, adults that have gone through the legal processes to carry a firearm.  

SB 13-196 is the liability bill

SB 13-195 is a actually just a cleanup bill that closes a loophole in the process to gain a concealed carry permit.  Years ago when we began the process to legalize concealed carry licenses, and cannot attend via the internet.  This bill is a common sense approach to make concealed carry permit holders accountable to the required safety training, and I will be voting in support of it.  

Again

Sincerely
Senator Cheri Jahn
