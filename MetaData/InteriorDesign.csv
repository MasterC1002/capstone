My girlfriend and I just moved into DC and could only afford a studio apartment (~$1600/month for ~500 sq. ft.). We were initially worried about space

Anything you would change? Did I make any giant mistakes (considering Im a guy who has never done anything like this before)?

**EDIT:** To address common questions below

* The paint I used was called Grey Mountain by Ben Moore (color #1462)
* Photography done by me. You can [check it out here](http://www.flickriver.com/photos/dwmark/)
* The deer head was bought on ebay ([Here is a link to the exact same one](http://www.ebay.com/itm/THE-DUKE-Deer-Head-statue-figure-H22-5-x-L15-75-x-W13-75-/140884772977?pt=LH_DefaultDomain_0&amp;hash=item20cd630871)). And then I spray painted it with [this](http://www.amazon.com/Rust-Oleum-249126-Painters-Multi-Purpose-12-Ounce/dp/B002BWOS7G/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353330138&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=white+spray+paint).
* Map (and many other varieties) can be purchased for a lower price than Amazon [here](http://www.wall-maps.com/World/NGworld-exec-over-f.htm). *I would caution against the laminated maps by Nat Geo b/c the glare is tremendous! I couldn't see the map till I was 1 foot away.*",self,t5_2r5qs,1353330743.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/InteriorDesign/comments/13f4xl/before_and_after_studio_apartment_500sq_ft_in_dc/

I was hoping that people might be able to give me some ideas on decorating and/or renovating.

So far, but we will be putting that table/bench on top of this [rug](http://www.overstock.com/Home-Garden/Teal-Grey-Area-Rug-710-x-1010/6650179/product.html).

As for renovations, we are hoping to stain the cabinets and put up a backsplash in the kitchen.

We also want to get ride of that odd/bulky sheetrock above the fireplace and replace it with a nicer mantle and possibly some stones.  We were thinking of something like this.

The living room was rather small, as it was just a mess of techonology and eletrical cords.)

I don't like clutter, we weren't able to pull it off. Instead we opted for a clean, relaxing look.

 All the cupboards you see are actually bookshelves filled with books in double rows

Here you see what is opposite the bookshelves - a sofa, except for the little wooden table which is an heirloom made my my great grandfather.

So yeah,500 on everything. (that includes paint, furniture, new hardware/lighting etc) The dining room chairs were $2 a piece, and $12 worth of spray paint. My TV cabinet is an [old record player](http://i.imgur.com/7NnXfs6.jpg) i bought for $15 then painted. (it's broken) The backsplash cost a grand total of $4. (50 cents for the tin, that i bought at a yard sale. And $3.50 for silver paint) Most expensive thing in my house is the couch. That was $500. But it was on sale from $2,200. So it was a fantastic deal. I never paid full price for anything. Everything is yard sales

So let me know what you think! Any suggestions are more then welcome!

The former owners of the house had left a half can of red paint (labeled crushed velvet) which was used to paint the accent wall.  I patched the wall up and put a new coat of red on it to clean up the look.  I also have a can of bright white paint for the doors and baseboards (have been doing the main floor trim with this color)

* Curtains
* Re-covering her grandmothers old rocking chair


and hopefully incorporate or compliment the paint colors with these.

**Basics on color theory**

[First and foremost familiarize yourself with the color wheel and how to use this](http://www.colormatters.com/color-and-design/basic-color-theory). Learn about harmonizing and complementary colors as this will be important in some palettes you may want to choose. 

**Choosing a color for a room**

Now that you have the basics down on color theory

What you really want to decide is what you'll be decorating around. Choose a focal point. Is there a sweet new piece of furniture that you have? Do you have a new painting or photo you want to stand out? Do you want things to blend together?


**Contrasting colors**

If you have a piece of furniture you want to stand out, you may want to choose greens for the wall. This will cause a high contrast. If you want to make the contrast less extreme, use secondary and tertiary colors. Examples of this can be found [here](http://st.houzz.com/simages/81506_0_4-7238-traditional-living-room.jpg) and [here](http://media.onsugar.com/files/ed2/192/1922794/46_2009/c42728ff53a6933c_Patterned-living-room.xlarge.jpg) and [here](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_-0Tg5RaCr5M/SqPWM15oeYI/AAAAAAAAAkc/IAKzIdiuoQU/s400/Contrast%2520Bedroom.jpg) 

**Harmonizing Colors**

Another approach is to make everything harmonize in the room. Again you'll want to create contrast by choosing deeper and ligher shades of the color you are using. For example

**Darker colors vs lighter colors**

Again you're going to have to think about the feel you want for the room. [Darker colors (deep shades of reds

[Lighter colors (light blue

**Resources**

Here are some good sites that have prearranged color schemes already. [I got these from a post in MFA as well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/r1ib5/i_thought_mfa_could_use_a_little_tool_for_getting/)

I recently discovered this subreddit

Now, but I enjoy doing it, and getting to redo it every time we move. :) 

 I'd love to keep this as a constantly updated list

Flooring:


-Rugs. Lots and lots of rugs. New York apartments always had gorgeous hardwoods-- so I have a hard time adjusting to the terrifying brown carpets in Atlanta. 

-Flor Tiles are a great way to cover up flooring. And with custom sizing

-Some folks go as crazy as to cover their linoleum with more linoleum… I am not that crazy. The premise is that you lay out a grid of tape


Walls:


-Painting- there's nothing that makes as big of a change as painting a wall. If you're scared to paint an entire room

-Adding moulding. I love chair rails, and above a different color. 

-Removable Wall Paper. 

-Wall paper panels

-Fabric hangings (similar to curtains- I sew a dowel pocket into the top of a piece of fabric. You suspend the dowel parallel to the floor

-Wall decals- Blik also makes a neat product similar to removable wallpaper. 

-Art! 

Curtains:


-Most of the rental shades are easily removable. I pull them down from the windows

-If they're not removable, although I also love the look of a valence.


Bathrooms:


-New shower head. 'Nuff said!

-Also sometimes a new toilet seat

-I like to move the height of my shower bar up to the ceiling

-For bathroom storage

-Very frequently I'll switch out the mirror that comes with the rental for a framed one

-I love to add the [Ikea Frack](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/38006200/) to bathrooms as well. Makes applying mascara easier!

-If the bathroom vanity is painted

-Towel bars. I'm not sure if it's just my luck with apartments

-Add freestanding furnishings

-Based on your theme, shower curtains, bathmat).

-I'm a big fan of storage cubes in the bathroom. I've also seen some folks use Ikea spice racks on the wall next to the vanity as a way for extra storage

-If you have a pedestal sink and need the extra storage

-Also

Kitchens:

-Add art! 

-Consider changing out the hardware.

-Consider painting the back splash. 

-Consider changing the sink faucet (depending on how gross it is!) 

-Consider changing the light fixture.

-If needed

-Some folks I know have removed their cabinet doors for open storage.

-Bring in furniture- a movable island

-Some people have luck adding temporary back splashes

-I like to add fun towels, a tea kettle, utensil cups etc. to the counter to make it more 'mine.'


Light Fixtures: 


-First off

-Most rental fixtures are a little terrifying. Ikea offers some affordable

-A cheaper solution? A lot of shades can be finagled into place over existing light fixtures. Use wire to tie the lampshade onto the fixture with the cover removed. Most of them have holes


Storage:

-Wall mount shelves. Not terribly difficult

-The Ikea Antonius system works well for us- we pulled out the bottom metal shelf of our closet and replaced it with Antonius drawers.

-Ikea Pax is also awesome (and endlessly customizable.) 


Details:

-I love painting the interior rim of the door a bright color- like poppy or sapphire- it takes almost no time

-Also on doors: If you have flat doors with no decorations

I design your ideas, unless you want identical duplicates.

If you provide a photo of the area wanting designed with measurements

Images can be done in colour. I use a patent heat dye. It is not hand painted or printed. I split the images into different colour levels. The process takes 4x longer per sq.ft than black and white. All images are done at 150-300dpi (Print quality.).

There are people that want the very best

If accidental damage were to happen years down the road

Each tile is numbered specifically on the back and has to be installed properly

I want it to be my sanctuary where I can mellow out, dynamic lighting and pictures is something I'd like to implement, I enjoy listening to chillout/ambient music with some insence which keeps me calm in a stressful day. I have a bookshelf, but I've thought about changing it out because it looks like a huge brick sitting in the middle of my room, it was just something that came with the apartment.

And my landlord was less than willing to help clean it up :~/ Also - the Operating Room lighting was a strain on the soul! 

So after being here over a month

The previous guy's existence in this apartment has been well-bleached away, but second hand doesn't seem to be a big thing in Korea, so hopefully I'll stumble upon something soon!

The main changes were: 

1) a coat of paint in the bedroom to cover up the weird giraffe-child's-safari-esque wallpaper

2) second-hand bedframe and new adult-sized mattress

3) two cool lamps with yellow LED lightbulbs (yellow lights in Korea are actually hard to come by!)

4) Just moving some of the furniture that was already here into more realistic and pleasing places (I actually took that shelving unit from the ""spare"" room aka - the school's storage room!) 

5) pictures and art from yours truly to cover up some of the bare walls in the living room!

Total cost was probably around $400 for the bed and the paint AND lamps! Of course

Thanks for taking a look! Hopefully it can give you some inspiration! If you have any other ideas for me on how to improve this place on a budget

Perhaps in a month or two as I fill up those shelves with knick-knacks and fill the walls with art

How It Works: 

 * PM me your email
 * I give the email to corporate. (Note this will not put you on the mailing list
 * You will get emailed the 20% discount

**NOTE** : I am not this altruistic out of the graciousness of my heart; there is a payoff. Top prize for collecting the most emails is a free couch! But I do wish to extend the discount so that you guys can get familiar with the products and become introduced to the store.

**TL:DR** : You get 20% off West Elm

**PM me your emails** 

**TIPS** :

 * The majority of our stores are in America, and London I believe in 2013. If you are foreign, and shipping is exorbitant on something, I would suggest contacting customer service. They are very willing to help, especially since it is a way of developing brand awareness.

 * Remember, even with a discount. This especially works on floor models and slightly damaged items (trust me we want that shit gone, it takes up valuable space) In that vein, always ask if there is a product out of box / slightly damaged that you can potentially get a discount on (this works a lot of the time).

 * And please

Thanks Guys! 

**DEADLINE FOR EMAIL SUBMISSION IS SEP 24**

**FINAL EDIT** : Thanks guys! I hope the promotion works out well for y'all! I have added everyone's emails to the list and you guys should be getting an email shortly. The promotion runs in-store and online from October 4th to October 10th. Let me know if yall have any questions!

Original Post:

I took some advice from /InteriorDesign and pulled the bookshelf away from the couch and up against the wall. We also hung a large mirror to decorate the long wall.  Wall coloring and/or flooring aside since I have no control over that

If seeking advice

1. A layout of the space

2. A little information about how you'll be using your space-- i.e.

3. What kind of feeling do you want to have the room to have? How would you describe your personal style? 

4. What is your budget? All out to me may not be the same as all out to me!

Hi r/InteriorDesign

Here's what the space looks like now: (pictures)

Here's a layout of the space with dimensions: (picture) 

So there a few aspects of the room I'd like to keep. First off, so I'd like that to stay too. We're in a rental so the walls will need to stay white, and we're stuck with the beige carpet. 

My husband and I use this room for entertaining and for lounging around, mid-century principles. Can someone recommend a rug, color scheme, entertainment center, alternative layout etc...We need to keep our remodel under $xxxx, and need to achieve xyz with this amount of money.

Thanks for your help!

So I have 5 years of experience with the business side of boutique/luxury hotels and destination dining, where design is highly emphasized. What's a realistic timeline for me to assemble a portfolio? How would my experience be viewed by admissions?

2) Does a post grad degree/certification make financial sense? Based on my limited research

3) Is there an alternative route? Would it be possible to find work with no formal training

4) Who / what should I be talking to / reading / doing to get a better idea of the industry and learn the language? I've sat in on a few design meetings

Here is the [floor plan](http://i.imgur.com/JjbFleY.png).

The ""off limits"" area would typically be the living area

Things I would like: 

* A bed - queen-sized
* A kitchen table - I usually eat at my desk
* A desk - I do quite a bit of computer work so I need at least a small working area.  Right now I use two small ikea tables and an Aeron.
* Some sort of social sitting (like a sofa) positioned to see my 46"" LCD

Because of the home gym the remaining living area is very long and awkward.  I have not been able to figure out a social sitting arrangement that facilitates a TV.  The long 15'6"" wall is also adjacent to another apartment so speakers against that wall would be a problem late at night.  The bedroom is adjacent to no one except for the apartment above.

Because of the above factors I have considered just placing a kitchen table in the living area and using the bedroom as both a social and a sleeping area.

Things I have:

* Two [ikea tables](http://www.ikea.com/us/en/catalog/products/S39903692/#/S89903699) -  23.5"" x 39.5"" - They are white.
* Aeron chair (black)
* Beige Sofa (with pullout bed) - 34"" x 72""
* 46"" LCD TV
* Crappy bookshelf (white) - 12"" x 30""

The walls are beige and the trim is white.

**Budget:  $1

I just started a new job so money is a little tight while I am transitioning.  In the future I would be able to spend more money

The building has a very industrial feel to it (old factory building) and I'd like something that goes along with that.  To start off with, TV stand, and maybe a recliner or love seat, if I have the room for it.  I'd like for the overall feel of it to be casual and simple...warm and inviting, kind of like a lounge atmosphere, but with the industrial edge to it.

Our ""master"" bedroom is small. We live in a 1978 split entry

We have been renovating room by room and I'd like to do something about our bedroom next.

The problem with the current setup: it's crowded! Also

So i figure we have 3 options: 

Option 1: figure out another way to arrange all the furniture in the current room so it's less crowded and doesn't block the radiator. Really don't think there's a way to do this as the other walls are either too short or have the closet in the way. Tried the bed on the wall with the door and there wasn't space for 2 nightstands on either side.

Option 2: switch rooms with the 2nd bedroom, we were planning on painting our room anyhow)

Option 3: Remove the window in the center of the wall in current bedroom. Move the bed to that wall

Sorry this is so long

The original basic idea of my bathroom design was this:
http://imgur.com/Tpl9p40

Now the stairs to go up are longer then original intended and the toilet needs to move into the bathroom. The best I could come up with is this:
http://imgur.com/MYIDjkR

The downside is that I loose the open loft-feeling of the original plans. Also I have to cross a room to get into the bathroom. This room would be a dressing and host a washer/dryer.

I want a bath and a walk-in shower

* Recommendations on hacks on making a small studio apartment ""feel"" bigger?

* I was thinking about using a room divider (not the foldable Asian style ones)

* Better to match the rest of the apartment's colors with the kitchen cabinetry/tabletops or go with something completely different?

* Recommendations on color schemes?  I really dig lime green accents...

* Recommendations on furniture that's pretty modern/minimalistic?  Hopefully the pieces will be fairly popular Ikea stuff that I can grab off of craigslist.  The only things I'll need are a bed, nighstand, stools, office chair, and maybe a shelf.

* Recommendations on a layout?
