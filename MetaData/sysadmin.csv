1371671015.0,1goci8,A new one on me - user physically attacked me this morning,DallasITGuy,1230,205,452,"One of my clients got tired of seeing Facebook

Monday I got any number of calls complaining about it but when they found out the owner had me do it they quit bitching.

Except for one guy. The guy who is their best salesman but who is known throughout the company for having a temper and a somewhat hostile attitude (he has problems, etc). This gentleman was off Monday and Tuesday and was really, really unhappy he couldn't access MySpace this morning. Luckily for him I happened to be in the building so he was able to approach me in the server/phone room regarding the matter.

When he found out I had blocked the social sites at the owner's request he was (to put it mildly) extremely displeased. He first demanded that I make an exception for him and when I declined he quickly escalated to shouting at me.

Then he got between me and the door and pulled out a knife. Not some shitty pocketknife mind you

I ran straight to the owner's office

Police found the guy sitting in his car in the parking lot talking on the phone. He told them he had pulled the knife on me to get me to listen to him according to the officer who talked to me afterwards. They arrested him of course.

Before I left the owner had me disable the guy's account and he was personally packing up the guy's personal belongings. The owner is going to get a restraining order on the guy to keep him away from the company and tells me he'll pay his attorney to get a restraining order to keep him away from me as well. 

I'm not sure if the owner of the company will demand the guy gets prosecuted or not. I'm not going to unless the owner asks me to. It was scary as hell at the time but I don't think it was personal so much as just him reaching his breaking point. Really I just don't want to see the guy again. Owner thinks that the guy will probably leave town if the charges get dropped.

**TL;DR:** Brought an office chair to a knife fight

I've been handling his companies IT needs for several years now, he never freaked out. He just wanted to be kept up to date on the situation and would let me do my job without being hassled.

When I first picked up his account, or not fixing things). I always busted my ass for him, and he seemed to really appreciate it. 

Due to a downturn in my companies revenue (losing clients because of aforementioned reasons) I was laid off. Before leaving that day, got the response, then immediately called me to find out what happened. I filled him in, and he couldn't believe it and asked for me to stop by and meet with him. He said without me there he wanted to find another IT company, and asked for me to help him on the side till he found one. I agreed to help as much as I could while I searched for a job. Well he eventually found a new IT company, and mentioned to the companies management that I was out of a job and asked if they had any positions available. Turns out they did, and were so impressed by the recommendation he gave me that my interview was a cakewalk. I am now with a MUCH better company solely because of him.

So yeah

1373004291.0,1hoeri,Is my IT career over?,,1095,277,594,"So I have had a pretty rough year on top of a pretty rough life in general and Im starting to think my career in IT (sys admin stuff obviously) is over with due to it.

For starters.....my credit history isnt that great.   A lot of it is medical issues but I do have a gym membership scam that hit my report a while back as well as a cell phone bill from a long time ago as well.  On top of that, my car is being repo'd so that will be on there as well.

Now

Last year my (ex?)girlfriend had a severe alcoholism relapse.  Long story short, who was 3 at the time, watch some my little pony parody where they were getting chainsawed to pieces and I let her know what I thought. This turned into her screaming and yelling at me through a locked door(i had lcoked myself in a bedroom).   They next day I come home from work and she is gone with a note saying she is leaving town.  She ended up going to her sisters, who lives 4 hours away.  She also decided to file an injuncition for protection against domestic violence against me and in it she had literally pages of stuff that was untrue or heavily skewed.  Before my day in court, I had sent a very long letter responding to the accusations for which she had no proof of any kind what so ever, and in fact I several video of her being drunk and belligerent, screaming at me, etc.  The day of the hearing, he sister gets sick of her and kicks her out and her mother helps her get a 1 bedroom apartment back where in town.  I let her take the Washer and dryer and even move it over there but when I did, get caught up on her and lose my balance.  Note that I had the phone in one hand and the vent and tools in the other.  I go to brace myself with my foot

I ended up losing my job because of this and have been unemployed since.  I actually had to move into a cheaper place and when they did a background search it came up as me having a felony for contempt of court for violating the domestic violence injunction so I had to go to the court and get paperwork showing it was recertified as well as the adjudicaiton being withheld.

I have been applying to jobs since and gotten several interviews but obviously have had no luck. 

So now when people run my background they are seeing a not so good credit report and a felony involving domestic violence and no one has even asked me about it or my side.  I also have not been able to pay my court fees (unemployment  doesnt even cover my living costs of rent and food)so my license was suspended.

Is my IT career over?   

Am I doomed to working day labor jobs?


Ive been trying to stay as positive as I can but somedays I just want to give up on life.  I even try to convince my self our kids will be better off without me.

What do I do?

Would any of you hire me with my credit history and background check?

oh yeah and on top of all that

First of all I want to thank EVERYONE who posted in my previous thread with supportive

**UPDATE:** Someone gifted me reddit gold, I appreciate the shit out of the support this community has shown me in the past when I had technical issues to tackle, and now with larger career affecting decisions.  You guys are THE most powerful tool in my IT toolbox.  Thank you.  I will now go search ebay for an appropriate monocle.

**TL;DR= I left my job after setting out requirements and being turned down/blown-off.  I do not have a job waiting to fall into unfortunately, I am available to work anywhere in the 48, immediately).**

I went in to work yesterday and arranged for a meeting to discuss ""IT needs moving forward"", right?"" and he paused and hesitantly acknowledged and then looked at her and she sat back down.  I think this was the first instant he realized this was not going to be a normal meeting.

We sat down and he pulled out a pad and pen and asked what was on my mind and what I thought we needed for IT to 'perform better moving forward'.  Immediately setting the tone as one of blame on me and my need to improve.  This is kind of how things go there

I took over at that point which got a slight look of shock and surprise from him and I just want to thank everyone in the other thread that pointed out that I did not say NO enough or set limits on my abilities and responsibilities.  This was instant proof that you were all right

1) When I was hired the company was 20 people strong with 1 office in LA and a small sales outpost in the mid-west.  It is now 60+, 2 in the Midwest, the beginnings of one in Japan, and plans for Europe, along with about 10 constantly roaming or home-based remote sales managers.   It was clear to me at the beginning that additional IT help was going to be required shortly, even at much smaller numbers/offices.

2) We have along the way absorbed a smaller company, as well as nearly doubled the end-user support work load instantly, without even getting into the conversion time to get all of their laptops and PC's swung over to our domain and the close out of theirs.

3) I have travelled 6 times to the midwest this year, but suffice it to say a 3 day trip to 1 city, ended with me driving a uhaul with about $200k worth of kit to another mid-west city, and finally flying home a week and a half later.  All outside of the scope of the original ""fly-in, fly-out, just paperwork right now"" plans.  I still remain the only IT capable resource in the company, and I am based in LA while the bulk of my end-user support is focused on mid-west locations.

4) Our media team continually requires network accessible storage for multiple users to work in with a good performance.  This is our Netapp which was purchased before I arrived, but continuing to hold it on the prime workspace limits the ability to bring in new projects.  The shuffling of this media off, to 'archive', consisting of external USB drives ties up workstations, network capacity (copy from Netapp to workstation to drive), and is inefficient as it requires in-office hours to be done.  Another network based option has been required for the better part of a year and unanimously everyone in the media department has stood behind me yelling about it.  There has been NO acceptance of any change to the current system.  All ideas forwarded have been put in the ""we'll talk about it in a few months"" folder.  This even happened DURING this meeting on this item.

5) When we absorbed the smaller company in the mid-west, mid-last year, the decision was made that we DO have use for an additional IT resource in the company.  His skill set was a bit more tuned to DELL/Windows support than mine, which would have been a big step in the right direction for dividing and conquering the demands placed on me.  After he made the decision to turn down the offer, there was never a renewed discussion about additional IT hires.

6) We have had a ticketing system that no one in the company has been forced by management, to work on entering the ticket information to open it, updating it with my progress, and then closing it out for someone on their behalf.  The idea that we are not big enough to warrant someone answering a phone, opening a ticket and handing it off to the right person to deal with it (he admitted they are not always something I should have to deal with), was floated.  I told him that if our staff could not manager the simple send of an email to a specified address, then yes, but he would be willing to send an email to everyone stating that they should.  I reminded him that the CEO and President has previously stated that to everyone in a company wide meeting call

7) The appointment of the office manager to be my direct supervisor was not previously discussed with me and wasn't clear as far as reasoning goes.  Her resume lists time at a large web company that has recently been in the news undergoing lots of leadership changes... as a meeting coordinator and PR person.  This was cited as her 'qualification' to ""help me understand the companies needs moving forward.""  I was at this point, that all of their IT needs were at one time just handled by individuals, or 1 person (the CEO).  I reminded him that was when they were 1/6th of the size or thereabouts, with 1/2 of the incoming contracts, for 1/2 the size of the work the current ones pull.  This led me to my next topic.

8) The company still operates, in 1 office room, eating cold pizza and promising to do things they had no idea how to do just to get jobs for their new company.  They're in 'Startup mode' still mentally, and un/fortunately, they've grown WELL beyond that point and are now a well known name in the industry, shoulder to shoulder with companies 5x the size and time in the space.  They should be proud of that accomplishment, but they need to be able to adjust to it as well.  Driving a bus is not the same as driving a mini cooper.

We've got a history of corporate dictating what needs to be done. You see, and tackle corporate issues like infrastructure, e-mail, ERP system, web filtering, and NOC this way.

The problem is that when the technical teams give management the down and dirty

We need more than a T1 line at each branch office for an 8000 person company? Shaw! That costs money!

So, that I'm not a manager, and I don't have the rights to make demands of our consultants for things like testing and validating configuration. This is consistent with the history of us pointing out something isn't technically feasible, such as supporting a baseline 20 MBPS throughput requirement at the data center in the event of a failover when our failover line has ~ 4 MBPS of bandwidth capabilities... Or like pointing out that a one forest, one domain infrastructure with 100+ global catalogs on T1 lines from California to China to Germany isn't feasible nor recommended... Or that centralizing our ERP and DNC systems to the data center is a stupid idea... 

Anyway

Fast forward to today. All of our infrastructure lines for our MPLS have failed. Hard. It's been down for 6 hours. As a result

Every single corporate system is down and this has rendered 70% of our manufacturing or shipping capabilities as a hard failure. Isn't that a great way to start the day for a multibillion dollar company? 

---

Now then

So, that I don't like the direction we're going, and that if anything bad happened it would be catastrophic to our business capabilities. 

I get a 6 AM phonecall about how internet isn't working. I figure it's just our web filter and tell 'em I'll deal with it when I get in. At 8 am I get another call - NOTHING is working. E-mail, skip breakfast, and book it to work. Get in and what do I find?

Complete. Catastrophic. Failure. It is incredibly ironic that less than 12 hours later, taking down our entire MPLS network. Nothing relying on anything corporate, which they've been insisting everyone integrate into and join up on because it can't possibly fail... NOTHING works for over 70% of our facilities. My facility we stone walled the VoIP and ERP projects, so is still functioning, but our E-mail, Internet and integrated reports for other companies are down. 

---

So as I'm briefing the President on why we can't ship product

I say ""Hi

""Well

I just addressed our infrastructure concerns. The fact that our sites are all on T1 lines. The fact that our backup lines connect to two 10 year old concentrators with an aggregate throughput of 4 MBPS and basic business operations are 20 mbps minimum

So... I just gave straight criticisms of how management ignores what's technologically feasible in favor of what they want to hear and whatever's cheapest, can't fax, can't e-mail, can't get to the internet, and can't manufacture at 70% of our plants. 

My president is sitting there staring at me across the table when I stop talking

...

I just smile and shrug. I told them yesterday that I'm giving notice. So the conversation ends on the phone and the President is trying to convince me to stay, and not just about IT. For 2 years there was a wage freeze where we didn't get raises. Every year I've consistently scored exemplary on the internal reviews. I've gotten two awards for outstanding performance and a commendation letter from the CIO. Each of those years I got almost nothing for a raise - 3% tops. In California, the cost of living went up 9-12% each of those years. Then they cut me to Salary, against the law in California for IT professionals unless you make a certain amount - which I don't. 

They consistently pay me just over 53k/yr while I'm performing advance database recovery, completely restoring an active directory failure where Kerberos just disappeared while maintaining their data and getting Samba back up and running, making technologies from 1992 live on current day hardware, recovering hundreds of millions of dollars of contracts from places they were given up on... Literally any problem that nobody else could fix, I was called for. I don't know how I do it, I just learn the tech and find a solution. And they know this, they call me to fix it. Fucking AD is down? Bam. Found a fix in two hours. Was a USN rollback. Can't e-mail Boeing? Bam. Found the bug in our TLS and fixed it. Database won't mount? Bam. Found out that the transaction log was corrupt and built an empty one and got it back online

So I get promoted into a position that pays less than when I was making overtime. Thanks. Oh

They don't care about my challenges. They don't care that I needed an assistant. And suddenly they want me to stay? Sorry

So enjoy your catastrophic failure.  I fucking told you so.

As for me? I've got a feeling that I won't be out of a job for any significant period of time. I've already got another offer expected to be in my inbox before I collect my final paycheck from here

The big announcement this morning was the big conference we are attending in San Francisco **next week**.  Here we are show casing the new SaaS product I built

While this is going on

We all sit down to do our formal status reports.  Basically we each get up to the podium

Dev Director says that they finally fixed a major bug and it has pleased our most sensitive clients.  She also notes that they made a major break through on performance on a new system (that I built) that one of her developers built.  

Services Director says that **they** solved a problem that has plagued them for a few weeks for one client and solved a ""super complex"" problem for another client that was solved under 6 hours.  He lauds his consulting staff for pulling together and fixing everything.

Security Director rambles some shit about MS patches and how we need to start doing regular patches and testing for our product line.  She also goes into saying how our SaaS product needs more firewalls.  I wish I was making that last one up.

Sales and Marketing Director goes into saying how our products have no competition and that the clients and customers are happy.  She even goes into saying that her new UI design for our flagship product has gotten nothing put praise from the ""community."" - whatever that means.  

We take a 10 minute break for coffee and pee time.  I

After the break

""No I'm not okay.  This bullshit ends today.""

I pull up my PowerPoint on the projector and go line by line where I blast each person in the room.  

Dev Director,000+ ASP files spread across 2,800 folders for single application.  (Showed a screen shot of properties of the wwwroot folder)  

Services Director

Security Director

Sales and Marketing - No competition you say?  (I pull up a product that does what we do, UI is terrible.  CEO, feel free to sort through this.  Trying to sneak in 4 first class plane tickets and a ritzy hotel stay and have the company pay for $13k for it?  [No wonder I can't buy proper hardware for our SaaS system!](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/txkj5/has_anyone_just_walked_out/c4ql8jt)  CEO gives death stare to Marketing Director.  Also, you didn't want to use the laptop I issued you for your Mac?  How did that go?  Lost all your data?  I certainly hope you don't have any of our client stuff on there?  You did backup your own laptop right?  Or perhaps its all in SharePoint?  2nd death stare from CEO to her.  

Jaws on Floor.  What felt like an eternity to me was really 3 minutes of LOIC verbal DDoS from me.  

I continue in a normal tone and manner.  

&gt;Today is International Sys Admin Appreciation Day.  I find it quite ironic.    
&gt;
&gt;I have worked tirelessly for this company for 3.5 years and to be shit on by all of you, I don't want to be lied to and take credit for my work.  I expected more decency out of all of you.  
&gt;



CEO ushers me to his office.

I don't apologize for anything.  He asks me what prompted all of this.  I tell him that he has been lied to for a long time about stuff in the company and he needed to know.  He didn't know that we have over 3

I put in my 2 weeks yesterday and the amount of butt hurt all day from the rest of the staff was overwhelming and satisfying to me.    
 

[edit] Yes

I also have a meeting with the CEO tomorrow (Sunday) for brunch.  He said he isn't going to fire me :)

[edit 2]

I know I didn't clarify this, but all that gets done is a written note in our files and that's it.  I am all about continuous improvement, but when I get stonewalled due to personal vendetta's and office politics, I draw the line.  

Do I want to come out as some kind of martyr? or hero?  No.  I just want the bullshiting and baffoonary to stop.  I have a lot of co-works that I respect.  They work hard and do their best.  Those are the ones that are really moving the company forward.  And to see their management misguide and misuse them is hurting everyone.

So, and President Obama decided to come to town to give a speech at a manufacturing plant.  No biggie, he's been here before, just a few traffic problems when he does.

One of our employees decides to be helpful and send out a message to everyone in the global address book to let them know to avoid the part of town he's going to for lunch because of traffic.  Unfortunately, now he's created a new ticket in Spiceworks, with the entire company directory on the CC list.  People start hitting ""Reply All"" on the message with little quips, and Spiceworks updates the ticket with the notes and sends out new notifications to everyone, which prompts more responses and more notifications and me to start wanting to tell everyone PEBKAC every time I hear them walking into my cube behind me.  On top of that, the president of the company is away on vacation, so his out of office message gets added and redistributed to everyone.

I remove everyone from the notification list after the initial storm dies down and close the ticket, readds everyone to the list, and sends out another notification.

Then the VP sends a message saying that it's all well and good that people are excited about Obama being in town

Definitely hiding the itsupport address from the GAL.  This is such a stupid problem to have.  THANKS OBAMA! ;)

**[EDIT - THEY FOUND THE ISSUE!! ]** 

Ok

Using a GPO and a PS script, the normal login script runs, but at the end does the Driver update.  This is why it seemed like it was working for a bit and then disconnected.  Using a MSI installer, the script used the wrong switch commands and it forced the driver to be installed regardless if Windows says ""um... no, that's not going to work!""  Naturally, these are silent, no-user prompt/interaction installations.  On top of that, the Computer Account was designated for the GPO.  The script was to run at a specific time which that too got jacked up since no one seems to understand EDT vs. EST vs. ZULU (yes

I didn't get to ask about why this was not tested on real hardware before and I got a ""well

As for the ""rogue box""  that is still under investigation.  I was told that BIOS password are being changed over the next few weeks.  I am actually **MORE** interested in the ""rogue box"" than this BS :3

------------------------------

**[EDIT]**  so

Talking to the guy for awhile, check the date, power off if date is less than a certain date.  If the date has past, it executes the PS script that uses a back door admin account and pushes the GPO.  I bet $100 on it.  I hope I'm right. 

We do have a policy that if a workstation has not logged into the network within 60 days

I will update after I get some more information tomorrow (Monday).

**[EDIT 2]**
NO

I called my contact and left a voicemail.   I suspect that he won't get back to me until COB with all the chaos still going on.   Email is still down :-( 

**[EDIT 3]** It is now 2:40PM EST and things are getting back to normal.  The Enterprise Ops team has been very quiet.  My buddy on that team has not responded at this time about what could have possibly happened.  Nagios is slowly turning green with most of the major systems.  SharePoint is up

My theory still stands that there was at least one disgruntled employee and did some nefarious acts to sabotage the network.  I have offered up my IT skills to the Enterprise Ops team and my director is vetting me to let me help them.  As chaotic as it is

I have also accepted the fact that I will probably not hear about the true cause of the incident.  NDA's are quite common and frequent here.  Hell

Worry not

------------------


Let me preface this incident with the fact that I stepped out of being a sysadmin (over 9 years) to pursue IT R&amp;D for a large company.

So, I reboot about 120 development servers (VM's) which auto-log in with an AD account with non-admin rights.  This is standard procedures after a weekend of updates and patches from the developers.  This is done manually unless the development team says otherwise.  I tell Nagios to ignore those servers for 15 minutes.

A few minutes later I noticed an email from the AD team of my company that came in at 5:45AM that morning:

&gt; Due to a Group Policy *mis-configuration*

wut?!

I checked my Windows workstation... NIC is disabled.  Poop sticks.

As I am poking around my workstation to fix the NIC issue (needs local admin credentials)

My colleagues are now starting to come into the office and logging into their workstations and other servers... some servers are production boxes...

Nagios is now alerting that Exchange
&gt;""someone done F&amp;^%'ed up...""

Queue panic and ass sweating...

By 8AM

I gather my team into a conference room and start to figure out what to do next.  One of my team members noted that the ""fix"" from the AD team was the worst idea ever... apparently the GPO

Being an admin for over 9 years

I have a few contacts in the main system administrator group and got in contact with a few of the techs...  here is a breakdown of the damage:

-  7200+ desktops affected in the US
-  1000+ desktops affected worldwide.
-  3100+ development and QA servers affected (90% being VM's)
-  18 Exchange servers
-  42 SharePoint servers (large farm)
-  29 facilities affected

My facility is small with about 20 employees and 80+ servers in our basement datacenter.  We got a canned voicemail from the Operations team to sit tight and an hourly phone update will come out.  The message also noted to physically turn off any and all Windows based workstations and servers until further notice and no one under any circumstances was allowed to log into any Windows machines.  

  We were told we could NOT work from home or not come in at all - if we did

Friday rolls around and 20 techs show up at my door to fix the issue...  

Reboot into safe-mode

It is now Sunday and half of the downed systems are back up according to my contact on the admin team.  The worst part was that not only was the GPO pushed to USERS


-------------

So the lesson here is that major changes to networks like that need to go through a vetting process:  Discussion, approval, execution.  Lucky for my company, with each update/patch/policy change, they have to put in an ""undo"" script on each local machine.  Apparently, each update package is pushed to the local machine and executed via command or GPO.  To undo something, a local admin has to run ""ctrlz######.bat"" where '#' corresponds to the patch # that was applied.

I got a chuckle out of the file name :3

Don't sit around and let the world boss you around, don't sit around and taking shitty jobs and deal with it, do something for yourself and take charge.

Move if you have to, the world nor IT is doing that too you, you're only doing it to yourself.

Once you realize you do have the ability to make a difference

Hell no, work on continuous integration, practice, practice, practice.  Expect failure but reward success, optimize your work, optimize your processes.  Use change management to enable your controls and audit requirements while at the same time documenting how work GETS done

Think outside the box, network, network. Talk to peers, network, get out and meet people, network, write a blog

Learn something new

1370547317.0,1ft83r,Tales from my support guy.,iamadogforreal,372,66,328,"Thought you guys would enjoy this.  We hired this guy a few months back. I'm the sysadmin and he's supposed to be my support guy. Its an entry-level role. During the interview he was super cool and once he started he became a demanding jerk. He'd criticize all the infrastructure

**Week 1**:  User says computer is slow. Aaron rushes into my cube and tells me it must be the ""CPU bandwidth"" on these models. He claims its bad. He wants to know where he can get a new computer for this guy.  The computer is an 18 month old i5. I tell Aaron its not the hardware and I'll look into it.  Turns out one single application was running kinda sorta slow.

He's also crazy chatty and interrupts me every hour to talk about cars, this was 5 minutes before a mandatory sexual harassment seminar. One girl yelled ""In 5 minutes we'll find out if that comment is sexist or not"" to him over the cube wall.  He didn't notice because his motormouth was running so quickly.  

He starts hinting at how we can pirate software. I keep telling him we have money here and we don't violate licenses. I give him this speech weekly until he shuts up.

**Week 2**:  User is complaining about IE. I forward him the email and to look into it.  He reboots the computer and tells me he's out of ideas. I explain to him how to clear out a cache, but he thinks its the ethernet cable. Anytime something is having issues, its always the ethernet cable he claims. I'm so sick of hearing that.  Everything I recommend is ignored and he does this cargo-cult troubleshooting of blaming the same 2 or 3 things. He never checks the event log or anything. I'm not even sure he knows what it is.  I showed it to him and he just ignored me.

**Week 3**:  He walks in the server room and complains about the UPS.  Without knowing my load, that its too old and small.  I have literally 5 physical machines in the server room now. He claims I should have at least 8U's of batteries maybe 16. I tell him I'm good, thanks and the servers will shutdown when power is out.  He says batteries that get old have less capacity and I have at best 10 seconds now.  This is all from his crazy brain. He has no stats or evidence. Just gut feelings.  

**Week 4**: He demands to clean up the mess of equipment in the server room. I tell him we need to recycle all the old computers in there first. Instead he gets permission from the VP directly behind my back and does it. He spent 5 hours moving things that belong in the garbage. Now everything is neatly put into unlabeled boxes and the old equipment is mixed with the new. I have no idea how to find anything now and recycling will be a PITA because I have undo what he did to get that equipment out of there.

**Week 5**:  He tells me he doesnt believe in making tickets. He thinks they're passive aggressive and the users will hate him.  I tell him its policy.  I have to remind him everyday to make tickets. He prefers to keep everything secret.  He also tells me he doesn't trust images or imaging and he wants to make every computer using the windows disc from scratch.  Everytime a computer has an issue he says ""I think its your images"" that is

**Week 6**: He sees me working on a outage issue at our data center via a ssh session

**Week 7**:  I give him a task

**Week 8**: I guess the VP talked to him, told him to stop asking me for access to things, and now he utterly refuses to talk to me unless absolutely needed. Silent treatment.  He thinks he's being tough, but honestly I'm so happy he's stopped talking to me. Its been so nice!!!  Now we communicate via emails our VP is always copied on.  I also enjoy that too.  I love paper trails and accountability.  


**Week 10**: Two weeks of the silent treatment. I'm still loving it.  Maybe he'll quit soon.



edit: grammar

edit2: Some others I almost forgot about

* Since he's started he's managed to infect his computer twice. TWICE!!

* He refuses to use the built-in gotomeeting recording option. Instead he's going to use 3-rd party screen capture software because ""its HD.""  I then asked him how he's going to record the audio. He looks confused and then he goes ""Oh i'll use a microphone or something."" He was going to record a webinar without sound.

* A spam email came in and he demanded I send out a all-staff email warning them about it. I said no. he then calls me rude.  Apparently, we use postini. I give him a postini tutorial and he just snaps at me how stupid postini is and how Outlook is better and he's genuinely angry I'm not using it or switching to it. I have no idea how to respond to him.

*  We were discussing a difficult end user experience he had and I said ""shes kinda bipolar, don't take it personally"" then he makes this very somber face, does a dramatic pause, looks at me, and asks ""Do you think I'm bipolar?"" I didn't know what to say. I said ""no no, of course not"" but I was thinking ""boy you fucking crazy.""

1355946565.0,154hsy,Learn Linux The Hard Way (β version),mwargh,363,73,122,"About 6 months ago I posted here about my introductory guide to Linux

Well

**Introduction**

This is a simple guide written in “Learn X the hard way” style, OpenBSD, OpenSolaris and even MAC OS X, just to name a few. When deciding which system to use in this guide I chose Linux mainly because it is most popular UNIX-like server operating system, which means what you have much bigger chance encountering it in the wild in comparsion to other UNIX derivatives. And Linux-related skills are relatively easy transferable to other UNIX-likes.

Now I want to tell you about the details. You will encounter many detailed tables containing lists of many fields. You may think you do not need most of this information

The bottom line is

But there is an other extreme, sometimes it is better to write this down somewhere and return to this later, or just ask a guy who knows it, but try to understand what it does on your own first. Chances are, if you were studying even a little in the time being, you will understand that one hard part much easier.

Bottom line. Know your stuff

**Audience**

* Aspiring system administrators who are interested in UNIX-like systems.
* Programmers
* People who want to try something new and to understand what this “UNIX way” is all about.

**Prerequisites**

* Familiarity with command line interface is recommended. You can get familiar with it by completing The Command Line Crash Course by Zed A. Shaw.
* Basic knowledge about operating systems in general will be a plus.
* Basic knowledge about networking will be a plus.

**How to work with this guide**

* Read introduction for each exercise. You may skip hard parts and return to them later.
* Type in exactly what is shown. No copy-paste is allowed.
* Compare your output with “What you should see” section.
* Read the explanation.
* Do the extra credit. Here you may skip hard parts and return to them later as well.
* Read manuals for commands you type. Reading descriptions will suffice.
* Do not rash! If you will try to complete this guide at once

**To complete this tasks you need the following**

* A computer with Internet connection.
* A bit of spare time.

And so

**P.S.**
If you will have any questions, ""I don't understand"" is a very good question to ask irrelevantly of your power level :)


**TL;DR**
Do not know Linux? Familiar superficially and want to become better at it? **READ. THIS. THROUGH.**

Logs point to nothing

EDIT: Thanks for the good suggestions. I tried several

EDIT 2: Reached vendor support, causing the head to mark most of those drives dead. Which is odd, because the RAID was up on Friday when it was shut down again in the wrong order. (I was out Thursday and Friday.) Everything I've tried since powering up this morning had no chance of succeeding. I'm awaiting a call back from the vendor, but there are other confounding concerns (out of date firmware, etc) so I'm not optimistic. Backups exist, I'm not keen on rebuilding and restoring without the other admins' input, but our project is halted without this data. *this is why they call it work*

EDIT 3: done for the night, will make decisions tomorrow. I appreciate yall's keeping my spirits up.

EDIT 4: 29 hours later (zombies! no.) I have no working solution to bring the RAID back to life with the data intact. I have a 3TB drive mounted at the SAN's volume point. That lets us do some data collection and minimal processing using one Xserve in the rack. An extremely minimal restore will let us get through this week. The work we do can be easily integrated from the temp 3TB into the SAN (whenever that revives or is rebuilt) and into our backups. Next week we will have more staff on hand to decide and implement a permanent solution.

**Lessons learned**:

   * checklists for sysadmin tasks need more details
   * our backups work (we knew that
   * information on S/Ns
   * log files need to be reviewed more closely
   * don't be first in the day after the quarterly shutdown
   * inaction usually doesn't exacerbate our problem(s)
   * it may be less costly these days to outsource the storage
   * could be worse

**FINAL EDIT** : 4 hours of vendor support later, but one array had a disk in an unsteady state. Only one physical disk had to be rebuilt in one logical disk.

I am a ""IT Systems Infrastructure Architect"", and designs to our clients. 

The projects that I work on range from $80k-12m. Ultimately the amount of budget that I work with can be manipulated

If you are my client and said that you have $10m to spend on IT and that you want a complete 'IT Solution in a Box', upgrades, and end-of-life support. If you say that you had $20k, I would get you some servers and some FOSS licensing and you would probably end up with a part-time tier-2 network administrator doing ongoing support. 

The point is, then the IT staff would build an email server and deploy email services. This ""problem/spend-money/resolution"" thinking is old and outdated. IT is not a cost center, at least not anymore. 

IT is now an insurance center. With the advent of all the cloud providers offering outsourced (everything), colocation services, etc... 

However, there are many ways that IT can solve this for you. We can build a complete new array of data centers with geographic redundancy and hosting in tier 4 data centers. We could subscribe to google hosted services and utilize their infrastructure at a markup. We could utilize existing virtualization resource pools (or create new pools) to drive services for the business. Whatever path makes sense for your business is the path you should choose. The route we choose to solve this problem is not the point of this post. 

What (at least I don't think) is a choice for you anymore, there are a number of different paths that you could take to solve the situation. There are many different layers and types of redundancy and business efficiency that all come with different cost models, different liabilities, and different business forces driving implementation. 

However, as practitioners of IT, it is our responsibility to make both efficient and informed use of the dollars given to us. We just need to find better ways of informing the business centers that we can provide a number of different solutions, from 'just enough to drive legally' to 'enough insurance for a fleet of vehicles on several continents that is simply impossible to take offline'.

**UPDATE: [Part 2](http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/16bsub/so_i_left_heres_how_it_went_down/)**

**TL;DR = I hate my role as the 1 man IT department and feel I'm overworked, and is doubting I do anything because there are still some open tickets for ongoing projects.  Do I rage quit? or bite down and play nice and 'man up'?**

And the full rant... 

I'm so pissed right now and my apologies if that comes out here.  I'm going to try and lay this out here in a way avoiding ID of me or my current employer.

I am the Network and Systems Admin for the company in title but in practice I am the one man IT department.  When I took the job, and overseas sales staff that are operating on all time zones pretty much.

I am on-call 24/7.  Literally.  I am the only one and they all have my direct cell and while I accept 'mission critical' calls are par for the course

I manage everything from reloading printer paper at the office I am based in, with people who don't know the difference between a busy tone and a dialtone, across the country.  I also manage the Cisco and HP network devices, and am expected to administer multiple Linux boxes running KVM, with multiple (too many sometimes) KMV guests.  

I am expected to document everything.  I do not feel shocked at that expectation as it's good practice for everything IT, as well as retro actively document the 5+ years of things they've set up before I was even hired!  I am also expected to document it in such a way that ""anyone in the company can open a PDF and do what you do.""  Basically a how-to for everything, up to and including (this was a real request), configuring a Cisco ASA firewall... written for someone who doesn't even know how to ssh or what a firewall is.  Back to the ""at the time you do it"" rule.  I am often doing MULTIPLE tasks at once and rarely ever get more than 15 minutes straight without someone dragging me into another discussion that probably shouldn't even involve me, but hey, it involves a computer or a file so... IT right?  I rarely get the time to go back and close out the ticket I just completed work on, before I am dragged away to another thing... and I rarely get the chance to open, and then close a ticket

On that... I'm at the front of the office.  For fuck's sake.  The UPS guy has ME sign for everything and asks me if we have shit to pick up.  Fedex too.  Postoffice dude comes in, deal with mail, and UPS/FedEx.  This not an issue for anyone it seems.

I have been with the company over a year now, so all I can have them do if I get time with them is tell them to update a spread sheet with numbers (file sizes) they find on various network drives.  That's all.

I have personally installed 2 full racks in 2 locations for them with servers, VPN, spares, etc.  I am the only person with access to 1 of those which is 2 hours away from my home office, and no one else is willing to get access so that if anything ever happens, I  alone have to drive to the datacenter to flip a switch or console into a server when a dev turns eth0 off.

We also deal with media quite a bit, and the workstations they run on.  I am also tasked with keeping a 40TB Netapp from being full.  38TB they need to retain there ""just in case"".  So I am constantly copying 2TB off to external drives for off-site storage, and by the time I get it open for another project to fit on, they fill it back up and yell or open tickets ""NETAPP IS FULL!!! HORRIBLE DISASTER!! NO WORK CAN BE DONE!!!""  They refuse to buy more disk space for the netapp, or alternate large storage solutions for quicker offload of data.

Now, but to assign the office manager to be my boss because ""she's good at schedule everyone's time"".  ie: she makes the meeting calendar.

I have a ticketing system.  No one opened a ticket for the first 4 months it was up and running.  No one.  Everyone called me directly and no matter what I did they didn't get it.  Not until I had to tell the CEO to open a ticket 5 times in a call did he get the message and then make a note about it for everyone.  He still never opens tickets but that's what it is, and replace mousepads, or hand them out.  I am expected also to apparently PROVE that a PHP error code in our products is NOT the fault of the Linux server it's running on, before I am allowed to have a dev look into it.  

Just tonight

3 weeks, there's reason to doubt that I've been doing anything?  Really.

I emailed the CTO, and who had repeatedly shot down requests for a) more IT help, b) more storage options, c) developers to look at site errors instead of me, d) meetings to keep us both on the same path with IT needs... I told him I need to know if HE personally has any reason to doubt my abilities and efforts, and if so HE needs to tell me, not this office manager (in an email she CC'd to him, and the CEO

Oh and fucking vacation time.  I haven't had a vacation since I started. They have a ""strict, I am IT.  We are a tech company.  I am always on call.  There is always something relating to some type of technology that needs to be looked at.  The only 'vacations' I have gotten, is the drive time across the midwest to go from office to office now and then to work at differnet places for a week at a time.  Seriously, they consider that vacation, or 'personal time'.

I am fucking tired of this.  I'm tired.  I'm just fucking beat down by all of it.  I think most of the people in this company are fucking awesome and great at what they do, everything from piddly shit to being the 1 person on high fucking alert during Sandy's landfall.  I'm just fucking tired.  I'm not personally invested in the company like my superiors are, and not guaranteed anything if they do sell, or we strike fucking industry gold or anything.  I'm just getting my paycheck (about 80k) and that's it.


I want to quit.  I want to clean out my fucking personal shit tonight, maybe hand them a formally typed letter and say ""sorry, it's just not working out."" in the morning and then go home, but what the fuck ever.  

Now, does it sound like 1 IT person should be handling this kind of load on their own?  Does it sound like I'm just ""not realizing my true potential""?   Should I bit the fucking bullet and nod and play nice and wait for .. what?

I am already taking phone interviews

I am just looking for someone to tell me that they've been here, then I'm probably in my last 12 hours of being part of this company.  And in that case, how do I deal with this going forward, eg resume?  Whats the best way to walk the fuck out (not staying for an awkward 2 weeks, fuck no)... and not cause it to bite me in the ass on my next interview?

Once the shock of the new interface wears off, if the loss of a start button to click on causes you such a huge problem you won't use the OS... well you sound more like one of my end users than a SysAdmin to me. Between win-X and just plain windows key -&gt; typing to search, I can launch damn near anything from my keyboard without ever touching the mouse. Every single thing people complain about (that I have heard) that is 'harder' to access now with a traditional keyboard/mouse: has a keyboard shortcut, or can be found and launched by hitting the windows key and typing the first few letters. Look up all the system shortcuts, they are wonderful for speeding up your workflows.

System performance. Boot times, lag on login is way reduced. Driver and Thread isolation works very, very well on Windows 8. I've not seen a BSOD since the beta release. Sleep mode on my laptop *actually works reliably.* System rollbacks are much better. Multiple monitor support is better than ever as well.

Tools for admins. The server manager rocks. Seriously it does, File History is a great personal backup tool, and a built in factory reset option if you get something really messed up.

All in all, there is a very viable OS here. And, if you have it on a tablet, it's even better.",,False,self,False,t3_1d30ad

There is no way virtualization overhead is that high; the old servers are Xeon 5100 and 5400s and the new servers are 5600s with higher clocks. For our workloads

So I've been taking incredible flak the past two weeks, and level of detail in planning; and mutterings about who might lose their job over an expensive debacle like this.

My job was on the line over this. 

But I simply couldn't believe such awful performance was possible, online benchmark results, switch configurations, everything. Everything looked kosher, but it just wasn't delivering.

Now, but found nothing amiss. The staff who had been supervising them also swore that everything was done according to spec.

So I yanked one of the servers and checked it myself: ""Trust

DID NOT MATCH THE SPEC SHEET.

Well, this top hardware vendor (whose name rhymes with either Jell, Jewlett-Jackhard, or JBM) can't read their own spec sheets.

1. Memory was put in weird bank configurations that limited everything to 2-channel 800Mhz instead of 3-channel 1333MHz performance. The NUMA layout was all jacked up

2. Xeon Turbo Boost was disabled.

3. VT and Execute Disable were disabled(!).

4. C-states were disabled.

5. Data reuse and streamer prefetch was disabled.

6. Power management was set to ""Maximum power saving"".


...so, fix all the BIOS settings per the spec I originally gave everyone, re-run the benchmarks...

...and **BAM!** 50% **_faster_** than the hardware it's replacing.

Exactly as planned.

Job saved

The guys who claimed to have been supervising and verifying are embarrassed as FUCK.

Ooh-rah!

**Update:** The vendor says their consulting partner was responsible for populating the memory layouts

We already have another $500, not to mention that everyone involved will be extra careful and falling all over themselves to make sure everything goes right with the next batch.

We've already been promised to get some promo test units before of the next project ""so you can verify everything matches your expectations.""",self,t5_2qnp7,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/k12p9/trust_but_verify_spent_250000_on_new_servers_that/

Edit2: OK update.  With the help of some redditors on IRC we have found that the largest issue lies in the fact that none of my domain policies transfered over...basically an empty sysvol folder on all three remaining DC's.  Evidently this is bad from what I am told :) So those policies must have only resided on the old DC.  I will bring that old DC up tomorrow on a small seperate lan
THANK YOU EVERYONE WHO HELPED!

OK so I finally made an account

The issue is...he left a mess that has blown up.  So we have two Server 2003 DC's.  And yesterday one crashed.  After hard-booting it, and found that a DC just dying is bad, so I went through the steps and decided to take it off the network. I backed up DHCP, brought two new DC's on an older (yet still newer than the current servers).  Bare in mind I have never done any of this, and only have a limited knowledge.  DNS and AD moved to the new DC's without a hitch, at least it looks like it has.

Next I tried to move the FSMO roles (again google helped a lot) that were on the dying server to the new DC (2008R2) and i got error after error....so I seized them.  So far I am feeling a little confident that I am going to get this fixed

I still have one old DC up (the one that did not have a million issues), so dont think I know what I am doing) and failed the ""NCDecDesc"", ""Netlogons"", ""Services"", ""Replications"", ""and SystemLog"".  Am I as screwed as I think?  Any advice?  I am trying to find a consultant that can come ASAP in this area, but so far the earliest it is looking is Thursday so far.

I'm not feeling terribly happy about it for a few reasons but mainly because I feel these exams don't accurately portray most things a Sysadmin will experience in the real world.  

* A lot of questions asked seemed to arise from the obscure depths of obscure environments that 99% of Sysadmins would never experience. So why this is tested is beyond me.  You can liken this to a high school math teacher telling you you're going to be doing trigonometry every day for the rest of your life.  This just doesn't happen so what does asking these types of questions really prove?
* I studied from two sets of study materials (Microsoft Press and Sybex) and one big thing I noticed was that the exam covered a lot of things that were only ever *'touched on'* in the books.  A lot of side-reading on this indicates that a candidate requires at least a few years of experience managing and supporting Windows 2008 network environments which leads onto my next point...
* I've read about people with zero IT experience writing this exam and passing first try

The takeaway from this is that I feel burned

***Things I've tried include:***

* Making detailed notes from course materials
* Doing in-depth labs
* Spider diagrams
* Recording myself talking over the study materials
* Using colors!
* *... oh and drawing on 14 years of experience supporting the real world environments that any decent Sysadmin supports.*

... **any suggestions on study technique improvements would be appreciated.**

When I snapped a screenshot of the desktop a few days ago they appeared to be working on a school project that looked like they've invested a lot of time on.  I snapped another screenshot today and they're still working on it. So I was thinking I would grab all of their documents, and upon receipt I'll return their schoolwork and stop pursuing the police investigation.  Obviously being in /r/sysadmin IANAL, so I'd want to keep myself out of trouble.  

So /r/sysadmin.  Any other suggestions?

I have compiled my top tips and I wanted to compare notes with other Professionals in the field...

**1-Have a written Agenda** 

for your IT meetings, Finished Business, Incident Reports, Current status of ongoing projects and future projects (planning)

**2-Incident Reports**  

(Use them and recap every week at your IT meeting)

**3-Keep a running list of any upcoming projects** 

We plan in Seasons at my college

**4-Keep your 5yr plan updated** 

At all times. Be prepared to have an in depth discussion about what your plans are at any moment. This keeps you thinking about the future and shows your ready for it when the time comes.

**5-Even the simplest project needs a plan** 

Even something as simple/obvious as a new printer needs a plan. Research and look at other options even if you're already steering towards a certain product. Be prepared to defend your decision and explain why it is the superior choice.

**6-IT Surveys (Anonymous)**  

These have a lot of value in my organization. We send them out before Faculty leave at the end of the year and we get feedback from them about everything from Smartboards to wifi. It has helped us address issues that aren't brought up in a support email since they are in the frame of mind to think about the issues they experienced during the year. We do this for Staff/Faculty/Students (believe it or not) - People are more willing to speak their mind if its anonymous and you will get real feedback that is very useful for future planning.

**7- Quarterly Reports**  

We are still working on this one. It is time consuming to put in the data and analyze it for such a small timeframe but scale it to your needs. Looking back every quarter to assess and plan as a team is a very useful tool especially when things can change so quickly.

**8-Maintenance Checklists**   

Have a Weekly

I finally got manglement beaten mushy over the fact that I'm utterly flooded with work and need a second guy. So they started the recruitment process which is a joke in itself

However


* If you put in your application and CV
Pretty much any layout does it
Even more important: **get your spelling right.** If I see two spelling errors in the first phrase already I’m going to check the rest pretty thoroughly for more. And if I find more
Use the effin spellcheck. MS Office has one, emacs, nano and joe.
Show that you take the company you're applying at seriously

* Show up at interview day in decent clothes. I'm not the shirt and tie guy myself so I don’t expect both from others. But your appearance is basically promoting yourself without a word spoken
If you look like some college kid run out of fresh clothes and taking the last sweater and jeans from the drawer
It’s better to be overdressed than underdressed. Do not look like going to your own wedding however.

* Proper language skills. The place to talk in slang and slurs is at the coffee maker not the interview. The company will pay you for professional behavior and not for wannabe ghetto street cred. Most likely you will have to talk to people likely business partners and clients on the phone. 
And while were at it


Now for less superficial things:

* If i ask questions about what you did so far and what you do at your current/last gig
I don't care for some rattled down list of abbreviations and product names but i want to know in what depth you used that stuff.
See there are e.g. Exchange servers and Exchange servers. The first variety receives and sends mail and that’s about it. My boss could install one if he had a user with the privileges to do so. The other variety is the one that’s integrated. Including fancy things like external spam and virus checks
What I do not care about is details about the business you do with your servers in your former/current company. I am pretty sure you have an NDA on those and it doesn’t shine the best of lights on you if you can’t fathom the difference between a schematic description of what you have set up/worked with so far and internal business details.

* There is academic knowledge and practical knowledge.
Both are important but do not lie about which is which. Nobody can know everything and you can’t possibly have had hands on at everything that will get thrown at you.
E.g. I have some academic knowledge about what tier-1 carriers put up with and what stuff they run. I never had hands on that kind of work nor on that kind of networking hardware. I wouldn’t tell that I did if I got asked. But I sure would tell that I would really love to play learn the ropes on that stuff.
So if a field shows up in the interview that you never worked with tell that.
Even if you get through that interview with that little lie
If you do not have a clue at all about something
Same is for having dabbled around in something for years but not knowing how it really works because that wasn’t really necessary.

* No mouthing of about former employers. Mainly it is just bad manners. Another reason is that I don’t care if your former boss sucked
Your general motivation to switch jobs however naturally is of interest. Pretty much every reason besides really brain dead stuff is ok there. The color on of the floor tiles in the server room doesn’t count unless it was pink and brown checkerboard pattern.
Pay, commute, etc. are all valid reasons and since my company wants to keep you if we decide to employ you it is important for us to know.

* Have an idea about the appropriate of your paycheck. There are multiple ways to check what is usually paid in the area. If you show up with a very low number, that is just business.

* Ask questions if something is unclear. That is your damn right after all the grilling I did and misunderstandings are usually easily preventable. You want to know how we deal with sick days? Ask. You want to know what management tools we use for Hardware? Ask.
Generally an interview has some small talk part. That is pretty important to get a first idea of whether you fit to your work mates or not.
Unless in the technical parts of the interview there is no right or wrong I those parts. Do not try to guess what the interviewer wants to hear because that will show. And probably I only try to find out whether you are a douchenozzle or not.



That concludes my rant. 
Even with the danger of looking like the last asshole I hope that will help somebody preventing from making the same errors like that guy last week and some of the other people I interviewed so far.
None of the mentioned problems alone are a real obstacle to employ someone

The interviewee didn’t get the job mainly because the lack of knowledge in a very important field to us. That happens and doesn’t depreciate the fields he is good in

I needed a linux box and you made it with the distro I wanted

I found out that one of the lab computers that was running really slowly could support more ram. I asked you for it and the only question you asked me was when you could install it. This morning it was there installed and working. 

I asked you for a Quarites 2 license as well as a Matlab one and you did it perfectly overnight.

I went to thank you and asked for a mouse pad. You handed it to me

You make my job easier. Time I am spending running defrag, etc. is time I am not spending in the lab. I have consulted at multiple companies for years and never worked with a Sysadmin who was as nice and professional as you. without that ram upgrade the one computer we can use for this test fixture would still be crashing.

1341059025.0,vu7s6,Vocatus' Tips for an IT Career,vocatus,245,41,80,"I got a PM asking for sysadmin career advice, smarter people have told me. I've broken a lot of these things and paid for it

My credentials: Worked in the USDA KC data center, CISSP, A+, N+, Security+ certifications, and a Bachelors in ""Cyber Security."" Finally, 9 years in the Army Reserve as a Warrant Officer

Without any further ado:

**Vocatus' Pointers on IT Careers** *(warning: wall of text)*

**1.** If you can get into a niche you really enjoy (firewalls, SANs, etc), you'll enjoy the job 100% more than a job you don't like but stay in for the money.

**2.** If you are a **good employee** (be on time, honest people are hard to find. This is more of a character thing than strictly IT, but it carries over into career advancement.

**3.** You exist to support the company, a fellow Warrant Officer told me ""Yeah, they're bad ideas, and we told him [the Commander]. But he acknowledged the risk and said go ahead anyway, so that's what we'll do. We're here to support the boss and the mission."" This had a big impact on me and changed how I view my role in the workplace. As an IT professional, it is my job to support the company's mission by tailoring the network the way *they* want. I might disagree and should voice my opinion as an expert in the field, but ultimately, it's their network. This is hard to swallow for a lot of people

**4.** Get at least a few certifications towards your focus, Security+/CISSP for security-oriented, etc. A degree shows long-term work ethic, and certifications show that you are staying current. Both are good. If I had to loosely summarize, I'd say certifications can help you get hired *right now*, and a degree can help you get promoted in *long-term*.

**5.** Learn at least some basic scripting. If you're a Linux admin, but I love being lazy more than I hate coding, so I've hacked together some huge scripts to automate things that are tedious or annoying. It takes time initially to write them, but they save HUGE amounts of time down the road.

**6.** An older Warrant Officer that taught a class I was in told me that one of the most important things he's learned is to take responsibility for his mistakes. Someone who is honest and has integrity is far more valuable than someone who blame-shifts. Everyone screws up

**7.** Have backups!!! I can't stress this enough. If you're in charge of the Domain Controllers, DNS, etc. If it's routers, back those configs up like your life depended on it. The day something blows up (it will, eventually) you'll be crying tears of joy you have those backups.

**8.** Document your network. I can't tell you how many times I've fallen in on a position (both in the Army and civilian world) where my predecessor didn't have any current documentation. Get in the habit of regularly documenting all changes you make to systems, etc. Anything is better than nothing.

**9.** Change things (for the better). *But*, and then, most importantly, *why* everything is working. Some things that seem stupid and random turn out to be in place for a good reason. I made a mistake in this area when I first took my current position. I wanted to fix some big problems really fast, but I stepped on a lot of toes in the process. I violated Dale Carnegie's #1 point in Dealing With People, which is ""don't criticize."" The guy who set this up in our shop is a #10 (see below) sort of person. My life has been a lot easier once I learned not to stomp on his toes when changing things he set up, just lightly step on them.

**10.** **Learn to recognize people that have ""unofficial"" power.** What I mean is people like the secretary/admin assistant who talks directly to the boss, if for no other reason than to learn from them. Never make the admin assistant angry.

**10+1.** Finally, don't trash people behind their backs. It will always come back and bite you at some point. If you spend 90% of your time listening and 10% talking, people will love you (more Dale Carnegie influence here). Don't think you're too good for workplace politics, just navigate them with care.

**11.** Just a thought on career advancement, whichever comes first. If I'm still in a position after three years then it's time to evaluate if it's a good place to stay.


**How I spend my time** *(revised)*

* About 65% routine stuff. Scripting backup jobs, user problems, etc
* About 20% cool projects that really make me think
* About 10% stopping work and being social with fellow employees, that people like you a lot more when they feel they know you a little bit outside of a strictly work relationship.
* About 5% big emergencies or critical problems. Although these are extremely stressful


**Daily routine**

Usually I come in in the morning, before everyone gets in. The rest of the day is spent working on improving the network, and side projects (if there's nothing from The Boss going on), or working on stuff The Boss gave me. Or taking care of emergencies if they happen (router dies, firewall crashes, domain controller dumps, etc).

I'll be editing this for clarity or to add other people's advice as they give it.

I've preached this many times; sometimes on this subreddit and it seems to be a point of confrontation for some. However

First off here's the [post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/136kds/cant_start_exchange_information_store_service_for/) and the relevant [comment] (http://www.reddit.com/r/sysadmin/comments/136kds/cant_start_exchange_information_store_service_for/c719ge4).

Now here's several articles explaining why it is a bad idea to uncheck IPv6 on a Windows Adapter:
[1](http://tweaks.com/windows/40099/how-to-properly-disable-ipv6/)
[2](http://support.microsoft.com/kb/929852)
[3](http://www.windowsnetworking.com/kbase/WindowsTips/WindowsServer2008/AdminTips/Network/DisablingIPv6theRightWay.html)
[4](http://www.sbsfaq.com/?p=2548)

So let's talk about why. In basic terms

Now to follow up to that, Premier Field Engineers, &amp; Support Personnel) &amp; their stance is the same. Microsoft states that they have no reason why IPv6 should ever be disabled and recommend it not be. 

Now there may be environmental reasons why; incompatible application, if you can't provide a good reason to disable it then DON'T (and ignorance is not a good reason). And please if you do choose to disable it then do it the correct way I have listed above from Microsoft. 

A common excuse I hear from people is that ""well I've always done it this way and never experienced issues so you are full of it"". In most cases these are localized admins who really only work in one environment. I've worked with many many different customers over the past 6-7 years since this issues has become prevalent and trust me; it's a bad idea. Just because you're not feeling the pain does not mean something isn't mis-configured. Exchange

Anyways

Before my interview I searched ""interview"" in sysadmin and read a lot of posts and a lot of comments. I collected the advice I thought was good

* ""Ask me questions. Especially in response to an open-ended question/discussion. I want you to show me not just your knowledge but your thought process.""

* ""One I have to emphasise: Don't be afraid to not know everything. Most interviews I've been involved in (on either side) ask questions that the candidate isn't expected to know, misdirection, and stalling are all BIG RED FLAGS."" ""I don't know, but I remember the man page for mdadm being pretty comprehensive""

* ""Try to be specific about where you expect to find the answer

* ""1) Avoid prolonged periods of silence. If you're thinking about a problem they've asked to you to solve
* ""2) Somewhat applies to #1 as well. If you're asked about something you don't know, say that and perhaps ask to move on and if you can come back to the question later.""

* ""No mouthing of about former employers.""

* ""Hey. I have a last minute pro tip if you want it. When I interview, it soaks up all the sweat from your palms. This way when you shake the interviewers hand, your hand will be dry. It sucks to be in an interview and have to shake the hand of the person interviewing you with a palm full of sweat!""

* ""I'll add another - if you're lacking on hard core enterprise ready skills, we can find a place for you.""

* ""Also, the job can be done. So they should hire the person who is a good fit for the company on all levels. Explain how you're great with people and how you feel you have skills above and beyond what your resume could explain about you. I hope all of this helps! ""

* ""Good luck

* ""For entry level

* ""As someone who does hiring of IT staff, explain to me your most challenging project, explain to me where you feel you saved the company money and how. ""

Below are more technical questions. These are questions I found here that either got asked about

* ""They asked 2-3 easy questions all related to active directory. Where and how do you add/manage users and shit like that.""
* TCP/IP - 3 way handshake (what it stands for and a summary)
* TCP / UDP (the difference)
* AD/GPO
* OSI OSI OSI OSI 
* ""I don't even care what role you're in -- you should know at least what RAID 0
* ""How do you diagnose a hardware vs software vs user issue over the phone with no remote desktop access""
* ""What is a subnet mask""
* ""What's the difference between FAT32 and NTFS?"" 
* ""What is a SATA connector?""
* ""Can you describe DNS?""
* ""How a tcp connection is created and terminated""
* ""How many drives can fail in raid 0,6""

Here's some questions that just about anyone asks. 

* Describe a time when you had a disagreement with someone and how you resolved it
* How do you handle stress
* How do you handle a coworker who is difficult to work with
* Describe your 2 biggest strengths 
* Describe your 2 biggest weaknesses 

Hope this helps at least one person!

1361976569.0,19bubl,On ethics,anahka23,210,40,112,"Long story short: the big boss of the company I've been a sysadmin at for over 10 years claimed he was being blackmailed. He says that someone claiming to be him used some throwaway email account to contact a female ex-employee and you can probably guess the tone of the chat conversations. The girl got suspicious after a few days/weeks and she called the boss at home. To add further drama his wife picked up and the girl told her everything. 

Needless to say the boss was not amused. He contacted a 'company detective' firm (not sure if that's the proper English term). I wasn't present at the meeting but the boss got convinced that someone currently in the company was responsible. Not someone specific

The detective firm asked for the following and the boss gave his permission:

* all firewall logs as far back as I could go (told them I could go back 5+ years and surely that was too much
* complete roaming profile folders of all 150+ users 
* complete home folders of all 150+ users
* all Exchange datastores incl. archive stores
* all PST files stored anywhere on the network (we don't use them anymore but a few still exist in the wild)
* all logs of our ISP (they even called our ISP themselves to ask this
* all this should be gathered and handed over in absolute secrecy for everyone else in the company

Keep in mind there are no specific suspects and this is a 'just in case we find something' search. 

Meanwhile boss secretly had hidden cameras installed around the office and was connected to the camera webinterface almost 24x7 watching everything. I knew because they needed access to the serverroom and changes needed to be made to the firewall. 

My first instinct and reaction was 'hell no

Plus the secrecy

And let's face it

Boss told me it was his company

To add some form of closure: boss ignored other partners and informed our external IT-firm (my backup basically) to hand it all over and keep it quiet from me and everyone else within the company incl the other owners. I only found out because I caught them transferring fucktons of data. Again I told the other managing partners and even though they were majorly pissed off I guess they didn't want to get involved any more. 

As far as I know the detectives found nothing. Nobody got fired or reprimanded. The boss took a 6 month semi-forced vacation and he hasn't mentioned it since. 

There's more juicy details and theories to this story but I'll keep it 'short' for now. 

I'm no lawyer but this seems borderline illegal. At the very least abuse of power and invasion of privacy even though it's company servers/logs/etc. 

Don't get me wrong; I can understand that the boss was pissed off, wasn't it?

Morally and ethically I feel I did 'the right thing' and I can sleep at night at least. 

Thoughts?

UPDATE: I'm based in Europe where the employee seems to have a lot more rights regarding privacy. Didn't realize it was that different in the US. Hopefully that'll clear up some confusion and stop the more 'angry' replies from our US brethren. 

TLDR: Boss claims he's being blackmailed. Demands insane amount of logs, etc be handed over to 3rd party. ",,False,self,t5_2qnp7,1361982535.0,,

Stay a while and listen! This is the story of our famed hero

So

I logged into vSphere to go restart the guest VM, so I knew the host was functional. I went in to our Backup Exec instance, checked to make sure that we had a recent backup (we did) and manually restarted the server in the DC. 

I went off, and the host still isn't responding to vSphere. Now it doesn't respond to ping, and I quickly discover that the HA on the machine wasn't configured properly. I walked back in to the DC, only to see *Grub Error 17* on the screen. Never have three words made me shit my pants so quickly.

A little bit of Googling tells me to need to use my VMWare disk to run the repair utility, rebooted the host, and all is well: the host comes back to life with the glorious little yellow screen.

I log back in to vSphere, reconnect the .vmx files right? Well, no. The .vmx files reconnect just fine except for communicator. That's gone. In fact, it's entire datastore it was in is gone with it. I had to run another repair run just to get the datastore to register.

I jump back in to Backup Exec and tell it to restore communicator to the old ESX host. After a few feeble attempts, I send out a remorseful email telling everyone to hang tight, and drive out for the night.

Fast forward to 3:45AM this morning, connect the vmdk file to it, and boot the new VM to bring it back to life. As I boot the machine, my heart races, my chest pounds... and it laughs at me as it slowly dies saying that it cant mount the invalid SCSI drive. Shit.

Even after extensive googling, descriptions of the host that I don't have. Every solution I come across needs me to have one more missing piece that isn't available to me. At this point I'm panicking, figuring that I'm going to have to rebuild communicator from the ground up, and I've got five hours to pull it off before start of business (and 3 hours short of missing my SLA deadlines).

I decide on a two prong strategy: fix Backup Exec and build a new communicator instance at the same time. If I can get Backup Exec to restore the machine, trying workaround after workaround, I finally get two miracles at once: I was blessed with a backup exec restore that is functional AND a faster-than-normal VM install. It's as if Hermes himself were running the packets through the copper wires, as the VM installs faster than I've ever seen and backup exec lays down the old data onto the VM host at rates we've never seen on the pipe.

6AM rolls by and the restore job in backup exec completes

Here's what I took away from this:

1. Test your backups regularly

2. Have a plan for when your backups dont work

3. Don't rely on HA to work flawlessly

4. Make sure your SLA deadlines are realistic

5. Don't Panic

My last role had me serving as a sole sysadmin for a small Cisco UC consulting firm in NYC. A great learning opportunity but there were issues.

Priorities were out of whack - Rerunning temporary network drops because they weren't ascetically pleasing was more important than setting up monitoring of core servers

Raises and hiring additional IT resources were promised for over 3 months while I continued to put in 70 hour work weeks. 

No comp time,3,2,1, day(s) before it expires with instructions on how to change it.

$9k below the average salary for a JUNIOR sysadmin in my market. They are STILL searching for a senior admin who's very proficient with MS and Cisco products offering only 90k (typically a 120k+ role here in NYC) while their Cisco Voice consultants start at 110k.

And many more. Ultimately I said fuck it. I took my $5k in the bank and submit my resignation. Spent 2 weeks not doing anything. Updated my resume and placed it on dice, etc. Interviews came to me, I half heartingly looked myself. I spent most of my days sleeping until 2pm, wake up call back some recruiters. Over the course of the last two months I landed over 100 emails with requests to interview, 20+ phone interviews, 15+ in person interviews and 5 job offers. My resume isn't anything to be amazed with, my experience is fairly young still.

What I'm getting at is that if I can put almost 0 effort into finding work, 2 said no to me.

This pretty much is exactly what I did. Just better. If you still are interested in deploying with MDT

_____________

So

My collegue and I sat down and worked on a solution. We used Microsoft Deployment Toolkit and set up a stick that fulfilled my needs:

* Windows Setup for about 15 different versions (counting x86 and x64 twice
* Automated silent installation of: Adobe Acrobat Reader, MSE, Java, CD Burner XP. You can choose which software you want to install, so this is no all-or-nothing-package. 
* Reading Win 8 OEM Keys from UEFI (was a big problem since MDT doesn´t support Win 8 very well and just inserted a wrong key)
* Executing a script to configure Windows to our standards (stuff like default folders
* Connecting to our WSUS without domain support

We are pretty much finished, select the software, configure a couple of setting and hit run. That process takes about 2-3 minutes, depending on the hardware. I can walk away and do other important stuff like drinking coffee and when I return after 20-30 minutes (Gotta skip that Windows Key entry field for now, but we are working on skipping completely) its pretty much done. 

So why am I asking you and not just give a link? We are from Germany, if we want to share it. Those embarassing scripts ... ;-) 



But I really want to share this project and maybe expand it

You know what? The thing about system administration is **nobody knows everything about every single piece of software/hardware in existence.**

The reason why a lot of people got the position above you is because of various reasons. Here's a few to think about:

 * show leadership skills
 * have a knack for finding a solution to an issue quicker than other technicians
 * ability and drive to further their education/skill set to meet increasing needs of the environment
 * **understanding they don't know everything and the ability to work with others on the team to get an answer and learn from their experience**
 * strong understanding of a team environment and willing to work with the team to better it overall
 * etc

**Nobody can know everything and when you go around your superiors back to upper-management unless you have a case of gross negligence you're only hurting yourself.** 

Rather than try to work with YOUR TEAM to fix an issue you're causing dissemination as well as showing upper-management your unwillingness to work in a team. You're shooting yourself in the foot and might as well go back to geek squad because you obviously don't work well in a proper team-based environment.

Me? I'm a senior system administrator. I'm the end-line and deal with a lot of crazy issues on a regular basis. A lot I can handle in a quick manner

Basically what I'm saying is stop being the know-it-all 20 year old and learn that everybody's human and unless you're seeing gross-negligence there is more-than-likely a reason your higher-up is doing something. If you don't understand the reasoning, doesn't scale or is too expensive for someone. Money drives the world and while everyone would love to have a rack of blades attached to a rack of SANs that's not plausible, we work with what we got and what the upper people want.

After correcting it by sourcing the script and dumping the extraneous garbage, it works fine.  As a last ditch resort after 12 hours of work, I started typing, and ended up with this:

http://i.imgur.com/GAQjNfE.jpg

With a sick wife

Edit: So, but the decision is above my head and I can't change that aspect.  It uses bash scripts in a very slimmed down PXEBoot environment (BOEL, if you're familiar with it).  Now, what's going on is we have internally developed console/power poles that can return the position of a server with execution of some really odd executable that hits an empty file in /tmp to do its business.  The executable then dumps 'setenv $pole=""&lt;position""' and other similar variables to the terminal.  Here's the terrible part.  'setenv' is a 1 liner that's set above to create a bash script that exports these variables.  Initially, there was a batch of ""read""s setup to capture the output of this executable, and looking at a working server, that seems to be what has worked (mostly) for the last 4-5 years or so.  Then, it tries to execute the script it created to set the environment variables.  Due to process forking, the variables set by 'read' seem to contain the data

I changed this to source the script instead of fork and execute, either.  If this runs from within the script, variables can't get set.  However, if I run these commands manually, they work fine, variables get set, and the install can complete.

The issue is that 'read'ing the output from this executable seems to work for 90% of servers.  I've encountered this just a handful of times, and no indication the other 50 won't have the same issue, so it's time to figure it out and fix rather than spend 8 hours clearing all 3600 external, 5500 internal ips from /etc/sysconfig post reinstall across 60 servers via console before I can get networking running correctly.

Edit edit: Here's some code:

    # Here's the setenv initialization
    echo ""#!/bin/sh"" &gt; /bin/setenv
    echo ""#!/bin/sh"" &gt; /tmp/console_vars
    echo ""echo echo export \$1=\$2 &gt;&gt; /tmp/console_vars"" &gt;&gt; /bin/setenv
    chmod +x /bin/setenv

    #Internal executable that hits the empty file /tmp/foo and dumps `setenv` lines to the screen
    /scripts/cgetenv /tmp/foo

    #At this point
    #sourcing it before using . but now am trying to eval an echoe'd export.  If I run 
    #this command manually
    chmod +x /tmp/console_vars
    eval ""$(/tmp/console_vars)""

    #I should have variables set at this point
    

Edit Edit Edit:  Oh god.  I figured out the issue.  All those 'read's I didn't place in the above code skip past the output of cgetenv, cgetenv throws extra whitespace lines, there's not enough read lines to compensate, so the rack position sits waiting for a terminal so it can execute rather than storing it to the file.  I think, rather than guessing whitespace, I'll use sed to filter it out.  My only issue is figuring out what's on those lines without any real tools like xxd, awk, it's shit code,False,

1314733559.0,jzdf6,Neat trick when troubleshooting MS Office file issues:,shifty21,159,15,33,"I had several employees working on a very important proposal document in Word 2010.  They had trouble printing the file.  It would get to a certain page and then stop printing.  I got the file and tried to print it myself.  Sure enough at the same page it would hang there.  The printer would print to the previous page and then quit.  If you click on Word

I remember attending a MS conference when Office 2007 was being announced and the lead speaker was boasting about the new container file format docx

Here is the trick: 

Right click on the file and go to ""Open with..."" and navigate to WinRAR (have not tested with other archive/compression apps) and open the file.  You will be pleasantly surprised that you can now see the actual contents of the file.  For me there was a base XML file and 4 folders.  I drilled down into the folder that held the images...

There were 15 images all over 1MB each... One images was my company logo and name for the footer image &amp;#3232;\_&amp;#3232;

I found the offending image on that page, rasterize and do some magic to make it printable.  I extracted all the files out, resized them to normal sizes and saved them all as PNG files.  Copied them back and in and BAM!  8MB docx file down to 500kb.  Also, it prints under a minute.  

This technique is also good for extracting images from Power Point files as well as advanced Excel troubleshooting.

When he started working with us, doing the same job as our 3rd flood guys. While 99% of us would be developing under Windows machines, he was the 1% that replaced Microsoft with Ubuntu. ""Gosh, Windows is horrible"", he kept saying!

And so he went on, implementing new features. Before the end of his first year, he was well known for his Linux expertise. Hell, even a couple of times we go to witness our senior administrator running upstairs to find him and get some ideas on how to resolve issues down at the server infrastructure. Without much effort or argument, he was easily handed remote shell access to the servers downstairs. It didn't take long until someone decided he should have root acess as well. I mean, the guy was a genius! What the hell was he doing up on this floor? It wasn't long until he was demanding his position to be changed. He wanted to be down there, rebooting and tunning up database servers for maximum performance. Eventually he got his wish. And that's when things quickly went downhill.

He was working downstairs, he felt he deserved a big fat raise. Management soon learned he wanted to top off our senior administrator and take his place. He was never confortable with how thing were done before he arrived. But can you blame him? Apache processes, cron jobs, applications servers and JVM, all running as root!

Things soon escalated to internal fights over security holes

But not without getting even. Ohh, he left the guys downstairs a little present. Over dozens of cron jobs running as root he picked an unsuspiscious bash script scheduled to run every 4 hours. One that did nothing much else than generate a report for an old project that no one had any interest today. He wiped the contents of the script and replaced it with this:

    echo route del default &gt; /var/log/xkdm.log &amp;&amp; at `rand -M 23`:`rand -M 59` -f /var/log/xkdm.log

Starting the next day, everything lost connectivity after random periods of time. Only in production servers?!?

At one point, convinced they ones they had were dying for no apparent reason.

A full business week went on. Overtime expenses were through the rough

That was hallmark moment in my carrer. That's when I changed my view on why you should never allow root access to ANYONE other than your Chief System Administrator. Not every company I worked for does this, but at the end I guess Fabio got his message across pretty well. He just can't be expecting a letter of recommendation anytime soon.

Probably the worst was when I was working for web hosting company that had been huge in the late 90's due to the dotcom boom, but only 30 people were left.  Needless to say, their systems were a huge mess and at least 7 years out of date with where everyone else in the industry was.

That's relevant because it showed how they treated their systems and their staff.  They decided they needed to lighten the load even more

I came into the office on Monday morning, which was very suspicious, but I did it, and went into the COO's office.

While I was in there being told I was a terrible admin and a ""bad fit"", and copied all the contents to DVDs.  The only reason I know this is because after I came out (under escort) to get my bag, I found it open with the contents spilled out, and a few days later one of the devs told me they were trying to find incriminating evidence on the laptop to try and blackmail me into not suing them.  

They made the process as humiliating as possible.  They've since gone under and the job I got after was 10x better.

I never fully could tell if people just get fed up in our profession and leave, or if they are forced out as they got older, but that is an important distinction for me at this turning point in my life.  I would rather not have to find a new career at 45 or 50.  I know too many people who have had to do this and it’s not pleasant. Doubly so because I anticipate my kids being in their teens at that time.

I do everything right as we’re all supposed to do.  I keep my knowledge current, etc.  I know what I'm getting into.  I even understand that most IT professionals eventually go to management or specialized fields, and I’m exploring both options.

I used to work full time for this company for for 3 years and have freelanced for 2. I've now returned to the company to execute a project. Since my Linux skills are now passable

I identified that MySQL was corrupt on two different instances and would need careful reinstallation by the hosting company. In both cases the sites were up and running but backups had been failing for ages and mysqldump was failing - so the only way to create a backup of the sites was at the file level.

After 2 days of my bosses refusing to accept the system databases were corrupt and demonstrating every failed action I'd attempted

* Shut down MySQL
* Backup the file data
* Capture the MySQL install specs
* Reinstall to specs
* Restore data

If they didn't support this, so suddenly my boss 'has the power' to run stuff on the server via communicating with the hosting company asking them to run commands blind.

Because the technician was only 1st line

I insist neither options are viable because if you:

* Restore a corrupt backup
* Reinstall MySQL without backing up the data files at the file level

You will destroy the customer data. There are **no** backups as it's technically a customer managed server and the database corruption broke the 7 day backup job weeks ago.

One of these customers I've worked with for 5 years. The other was a new customer and his site hadn't started getting traffic.

I was told I had 'wasted two days investigation already' and 'this guy is a senior linux admin and knows much more than you' and that my boss would take me out of the loop and just manage the issue himself.

I said this is the last copy of the customer's online business and there are no backups. Either course of action will destroy his site. He said he would 'take that up with the hosting company' if that happened. I said a years free hosting won't change the fact you're about to give the order to destroy the guy's business.

Anyhow

Unfortunately

Speaking to my dad this evening

I now have problems! Tomorrow I have to:

* Deal with my boss
* Deal with my coworkers

Both of which have seen me throw a fit over this issue and leave the office early. Because I'm not going to allow the site to be destroyed I'm unlikely to be publically vindicated. How did it come to this?

**TL;DR** Walked out of office in protest of boss about to destroy a client's business. Very stressed and concerned about tomorrow.

**Edit** Result: One customers database was destroyed

**Edit 2**
I'd like to say thank you to the support and technical tips provided by everyone. Whilst I was stressed much of the day over the issue

Final fall out? The customer who's database was lost wasn't yet live so there's basically a few days of unpaid design work to rebuild the recently built site from sources as the financial penalty which the business accepted. I still need to explicitly apologise to my colleagues and my one report for losing my cool with a carefully balanced blend of contrition and complaining.

That got me thinking, and he said the cleaning staff have a master key, same as his. He tried his master key on our server room door, and sure enough, it opened.

I didn't like that. So I told management we needed to get that door re-keyed, as I regularly keep a lot of expensive equipment in my office.

Here is the kicker

I let management know that I didn't think managers should have user passwords

They want to know how they are supposed to access user workstations if they need access to files and the users a out of the office.

My recommendation is the following:

1.  We can reset the password to the user account and then a manager can log in

2. We can connect remotely to the machine and pull a file for a manager.

3. Files that need to be accessed by others should be on department shares in the first place.

Any other recommendations on how to handle this?  Do you guys think it's OK to let management have passwords for users under them?

I don't care if you're a child prodigy that can solve any problem, how would I know that if your resume sucks? Also, don't lie on your resume, it helps.

Interviews are fun, one was a no show, and I had two come in that were so under qualified that I won't have them back for round two.

* I have nothing but respect for hiring managers that have to deal with this for a living. I couldn't deal with it
* I stand by my opinion on the lack of quality on resumes. If you can't take the time to present yourself well in a document that is meant to showcase your skills then I have no confidence in your ability to do the job. I work at a company that deals with financial institutions and some government agencies. Attention to detail matters. If your resume sucks

These are all the PDQ Deploy installers we use in our shop. Thanks again to [AdminArsenal](http://www.adminarsenal.com/pdq-deploy-features/#0) for such a great product. All of these install silently without any user interaction.

**Installer list:**

 - Adobe Flash Player v11.4.402.265 (Firefox)

 - Adobe Flash Player v11.4.402.265 (IE / ActiveX)

 - Adobe Reader X v10.1.4

 - Adobe Shockwave v11.6.6.636 (full)

 - Google Chrome Enterprise v21.0.1180.83 (latest)

 - Java Runtime 6 update 35 (32-bit)

 - Java Runtime 6 update 35 (64-bit)

 - Java Runtime 7 update 7 (32-bit)

 - Java Runtime 7 update 7 (64-bit)

 - Mozilla Firefox v14.0.1 (customized)

 - Mozilla Firefox v14.0.1 (default install)

 - Mozilla Firefox v15.0.0 (customized)

 - Mozilla Thunderbird v14.0.0 (customized)

 - Mozilla Thunderbird v14.0.0 (default install)

 - Mozilla Thunderbird v15.0.0 (customized)

 - Mozilla Thunderbird v15.0.0 (default install)

 - Notepad++ v6.1.6

 - WinSCP v4.3.9

 - Adobe Flash Player uninstaller

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Use:**

1. Import ""Installers.xml"" and ""Uninstallers.xml"" files into PDQ deploy.

2. Copy all files from ""installers"" to wherever your repository is.

3. All our jobs reference the **$(Repository)** variable

**Notes:**

1. Make sure to read job notes for each package
 - If there is a .bat file with a job
 - If there ISN'T a .bat file with a job
 - All jobs have the option ""Copy all files in the directory"" checked to bring their files with them to the remote computer. I've found this works better than having jobs pull files individually during install.

2. **Thunderbird**:
 - Our (customized) Thunderbird uses a global config file on the network. This lets us change Thunderbird settings en masse for the entire network if we need to. 
 - You can disable this behavior OR set the location of the global config file by tweaking the 'thunderbird-custom-settings.js' file the job copies over.
 - A copy of the global config file we use is in the Thunderbird (customized) directories and is called 'thunderbird-global-settings.js' 

3. **Firefox**:
 - 'Firefox v15.0.0 (default)' isn't there
 - 'Firefox v15.0.0 (customized)' works fine.

I spoke with a client who wants to upgrade the server that run his security cameras.  The server it's running on is getting a little aged, it's not worth it.  I called the software vendor for instructions on migrating it to new hardware and was told that... Sorry!  The serial key is tied to the MAC ADDRESS of the server's NIC (which is on-board), and to generate a new key for the new server would take 48 hours and $250.  

I asked ""What if the NIC was to die and needed to be replaced?  Or what if I decided to add a second NIC in order to team the two for redundancy? Or what if I wanted to upgrade the existing 10/100 card with a gig card?""  Their response was ""48 hours and $250""...

Yes I can clone the mac address

Checking the server connectivity (control + right click the outlook icon in the system tray) reports normal server connectivity.  Autoconfiguration settings (in the DNS record) are verified to be correct (also control + right click the systray icon).

So far the troubleshooting steps proposed by Microsoft are:

* Step 1. Ensure that your Operating System and Software are up to date.

* Step 2. Repairing your profile may resolve your connection issue.

* Step 3. Verifying Connectivity and Autodiscover settings.

These have proven to be ineffective.

There is no ETA for a fix.

Office 365 recently went through some software/server upgrades/moves/something and support engineers at Microsoft say that many things went wrong and they are struggling to fix everything that went wrong.  I have another issue that was reported 2 1/2 weeks ago (unrelated to the connectivity problems but related to the server moves) and I just received word that they have finally diagnosed that problem but it will take ""a few more days"" to resolve because Office 365 is ""a multi-tenant environment"".

For side projects I'm running a few Debian boxes across the internet. As everyone I started with manual aptitude invokes

The setup I'm dreaming of is a git repository which describes all the machines I admin

More specifically

  - do I need a new box specifically to run as a puppet master ? Or can I run it on one of the existing boxes ?
  - is it necessary that the puppet clients stay connected to master ? does it generate a lot of bandwidth ?
  - can I easily implement the git workflow I described above ? (or if there's a better idea please let me know)

What did I do:   

I went to my management and explained how I felt and what my situation was, and my boss allowed me to stay over the weekend on the company dime and have my wife come up to stay with me (gramma watched the kids) to get some non-work related R&amp;R.

From the classes I learned a couple key things (amongst many)

1.  My written communications were very ""unfriendly""  I would simply state (or demand) what I wanted without much courtesy.  I spent a chunk of time focusing on rewording emails to *ask* for what I needed, or just plain run of the mill.  I also learned how to properly write emails showing displeasure with someones actions/activities without using such words as 'asshat', 'douchenozzle', and my (old) personal favorite 'donkey-rapist'.

2.  I needed to step up my verbal communications.  I am a remote employee and had lost touch with the 'haps in the office.  Since most of my communication was via IM and email I rarely actually talked to many of my coworkers.   Anything that would take more than 2 back-and-forths over IM I pick up the phone for now.   I think I've learned more about my coworkers in the past three weeks than in the past 4 years.  

Number 2 I think was the key for me, and stuff got spat out with no concept of what happened in between.  Now that I've been communicating more with them they have more of a sense of what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.

So I know that sometimes that the HR is the big evil monster who just wants you to do paperwork

Little did i know that this path does not exist in XP. 2 hours after doing all this i get my first call

I knew something went wrong somewhere. I quickly disabled the policy and deleted the script from all dc's to minimize the effect. tested the command in xp and ound that there is is no localappdata in xp and script just deleted all files in c and it's sub directories.

There are three servers, and a ""promail"" server... Promail is basically a warehousing/processing/shipping software from what i have learned so far.  The servers are all running windows 2003, and windows is a few months out-dated on all of them.  I would update them, but im not even sure how to go about doing that.  Plus i feel like doing so would most certainly mess other things in the system up.  In addition to the servers there is about 65 computers in this huge building running a mix of windows 7, and windows xp pro.

Here is where it gets really interesting.. I have built about 10 computers for myself/friends/family, i have literally no experience with professional servers.

1353493411.0,13k6xq,My coworker changed server credentials while he is sick,Philorkill,156,48,120,"Dear Sysadmins

This is my first post and I feel something like a relative had died.

The story is this: I work for a small company and my coworker and I share the load in software development and managing of the rented servers. I joined the company almost a year ago and he is for over 3 years in the same position. I have to say, I earned the trust of my fellow coworker and went with him for lunch every day, until yesterday....

He came in the office quite upset and sweared quite a lot in front of his PC. Of course I noticed his bad mood and asked what the matter is and If I could help or if I was maybe the cause of any problem he obviously had. -Edit- He wouldn't tell. At noon he left the office and told the boss he was sick.

When I came in the office this morning, so I checked whith our hoster if there was any security breach (couldn't ask my coworker directly because he is ""sick""). Turns out he changed all the passwords on our most valuable servers. I wrote him an e-mail to ask why, but he wouldn't respond, so I told my boss. My coworker finally answered my boss,  but not me, that there were some ""problems"" and that it wouldn't affect my work (except I could not make an assesment why our webservers were down).

Long story short. I can't fight the feeling that my coworker is trying to put me down or something like that. My boss is pissed of and I am too. 

So

Thanks!

As much as I did not want to leave them without my skills

We rebuilt our DC over the last 4-6 months and I made sure they were a major part of this process while documenting EVERYTHING. I made sure to tell him before I put in my notice so that he was aware of the situation at hand. As expected

I have plenty of bad things to say about how things worked out in our office but it is not the time or place to discuss them beyond the ""Tons of stuff against the general best-practices"" setup. 

I am moving on to be a full time student and will be working as a basic ""helpdesk"" type tech on campus while I focus on getting my degree and helping our Cyber Defense team rock the world =)  


I feel like this was where I had to go if I want to advance in the world and be more than just a ""sysadmin"". The world is a a big place and I have yet to make a large enough mark on it to be useful. 

I just felt like telling ***someone***. I hope reddit is a good place for this.

On an unrelated note: I am teaching LINUX Admin at a local community college and I am happy to share my course with anyone interested in learning. If you PM me I will send you my email address and my *current* course work that you can complete and send back to me for a ""grade"" and feedback if your are interested in getting into Linux admin. 

 Before anyone worries about the ""new guy"". He is experienced in Linux and needed very little catch-up to understand our setup. I built this DC(Data Center) from scratch from 2 servers up to our current 45 servers (On a rock-solid VM setup) with hundreds if not thousands of clients. 

He understands exactly what he has gotten himself into and I have made it very clear that he is to contact me if there are questions about how something works if the documentation is lacking. (You always miss something right?)

All-in-all. I cant wait to be a full time student for the first time in 5-6 years and im going for a killer degree in hardware + software. Sysadmin is fun but I like to build ""things"" =) 

Good Luck to everyone else out there in Admin Land! Thanks for being an outlet for my last ""im an admin"" post!

For most the adventure of hunting down a new food truck during lunch is as long a term of exposure to sunlight we commonly get.

Still

I'm in the midst of trying to schedule an interview with the owner of a small GIS data collection company.  It's a 20-50 person operation working teams of two all over the US West of the Mississippi.  They are looking for a one-man-band IT guy and I've already spoken with one of the senior employees of the company.  I have his approval at this point buy my candidacy now goes to the old man himself.

In addition to managing a couple of VPS's for core services I'd be responsible for the GIS and PC gear the teams use in the field.  I'd be doing a lot of remote support but also a lot of travel and time in field (about 2/3 on the road or in the bush) doing testing and development of new gear and processes.  I would also be going in-field with teams to train and deploy new gear.

We're talking ATV's and horseback deep in the bush.  Helicopters and off-road vehicles.  Burbs and Urbs in the mix as well.

No cubicle.

I've been in IT for 20 years and this would be a huge change for me.  I'd be going from planning the deployment of hundreds of servers or switches to a couple dozen laptops.  I've been a GIS analyst and admin for many of those years.

The money's good

I'm actually a geocache nerd as well and have dabbled in urban exploration.  I love to travel and explore in general.  I'm not a big fan of tourist sites

This is crazy right?  Nobody gets out of cubeville.  I must be dreaming.

TL;DR: Ranting to get to catharsis.


5.13 local time (3.13 servers time) I was peacefully asleep when the pager woke me up. Just in case I didn't listen, still half asleep, and notice that the root cause is a down db. Weird, we have a failover, what's going on? Before continuing my troubleshooting, I contacted the dba.


Surprise! Even at this time of the night, so he decided to wake up someone else from my team (who wasn't on call) to let him know something was wrong. Poor guy, but whatever, he saved me a call because I needed a hand.


Since it was a db issue, to provide a hand. Meanwhile the dba was asking via irc for a bridge to start troubleshooting (what? can't you use irc??). I ask dba if he had done any changes. Negative. So far he had detected that mysql wasn't running and that the san partition with the db wasn't mounted. He didn't know what the failover server was.


Coworker 2 connected, cleared the locked processes, and by restarting all the apaches that didn't take kindly to not having a db, we got our live site up.


Now that everything is stable

1. There were no scheduled changes tonight
2. The logs showed that there were mysql restart commands manually launched
3. Mysql went down 3.10
4. The monitoring that he claimed had warned him of what was going on has been dead for months
5. DBA claimed he had done no changes
6. DBA has a history of doing changes without records, killing the livesite, and he doesn't know how to fix
7. DBA always chooses to lie instead of admitting he was doing things he shouldn't have


So he was confronted: He didn't do it. He was presented with the logs. He claims to have connected because he saw that something was up (he even saw it happening in the broken monitor 2 mins before actually happening!). He claims the db chose to get restarted on its own


So, hate, HATE people like this, who lie to try to get out of trouble, who keeps on lying when confronted with evidence of their lies. Why don't they have the balls (or the ovaries) to say ""I fucked up, I'm sorry, but I'll never do the same mistake again""?? And why do they keep on doing the same mistakes over and over again? Learn something, we had revoked his access. Nope

I went to the switch room in the other building and see a 3 pair MM patch panel mounted on the switch rack so I know there has to be one in this bulding somewhere. I get a guy from maintenance who has worked in the building for 10 years to help me trace down where the cable leads. We follow it through the false ceiling about 50 feet down a hall to a door that he has never opened since he has been there. We open the door and there is a walk in cooler with the door removed in the room that is being used to store old office furniture. Above it we can see the fiber running above the false ceiling next door. I get a ladder and climb up on the cooler and point my flashlight down to the false ceiling next door and this is what I find:

2. The stencils are either too generic or too specific.  I don't need a near-photorealistic looking Catalyst switch; that level of detail just distracts from the diagram.  At the other end of the spectrum: I can have any type of computer... as long as it's beige and either a desktop or a full-size tower.

Wondering if you think this sounds like your classic burnout or what:
I've been in this industry for around 10 years now, first assignment i was given was to convert their 2 major pieces of software into 1 new program that had been purchased before i came aboard.  we just rolled it out beginning of this month, i have been working long hours dealing with this rollout, actually getting this place into a decent workable structure and getting to know this undocumented network.  I had also purchased a new house 5 months prior to starting here and have been reno'ing it in my ""downtime"" when i am not dealing with my 4 year old daughter and 8 month old son.  Lately i have just lost all interest in doing ANYTHING, all i want to do is sleep and immerse myself in cheap shitty sci fi books.  my stomach tightens into knots as soon as i wake up in the morning because i'm dreading going into work.  Nothing seems enjoyable anymore.  Started seeing a therapist a few weeks ago because i am sick and tired of being sick and tired, and she says take some time off work (impossible it seems like with new house, new born and his sister)  I really don't know what to do, i'm drinking WAY too much and just generally a complete and total wreck.  
Does this sound like burnout to you guys
sorry for the wall of text i just wanted to hear what you guys thought about this situation.

Since Friday around 10PM and now (5PM EST) my office still has no power.  I have been there 4 different times since Friday checking on power and consulting with my 2 Jr. Admins.  In the end we planned for stuff

To start, like an idiot) to put it with the Exchange servers.  As you can imagine, OWA, ActiveSync and Outlook Anywhere is NOT working or anything that needs to authenticate over AD.

Admitting this is my fault has fortified the need for a retooling of our DR planning.  

The one thing that did work was that the data storage is safe.  I did check and the ZFS SAN's have reported that all replication has finished and that there are no issues.  Even better was that all of the KVM virtual machines are running in DR. The HA ESX4 cluster didn't fair so well

I came up with a plan to move our PDC from our main office to our DR site right now assuming that the power is still out in the morning.  Everything on the production network is in the same subnet

To give you all some background on how it kinda ended up this way has to do with the lack of motivation from the C-Levels.  I have been pressuring them to migrate to Office365 for Exchange and SharePoint and to invest some more money in reducing the need to have our production servers in our main office.  I have shown plenty of evidence that even if we don't use a DR scenario

To limit trips back to the office to see if the power is on or not, installed Tasker, SL4A, Python and SuperUser.  I set it up to email me when power has been restored.  And also if the power goes out again.  I only knew the when it happened when my VPN tunnel from my house to the office went down.  I'll do full detailed write up on that once things settle in the office.  

**[EDIT]** [Posted an article on using Android and Tasker to detect power outages and restoration.](http://www.sysadminnexus.com/2012/07/01/how-to-detect-power-outages-and-when-it-is-restored/)

Lastly, Finance Director, HR and Marketing Director is that no one wants to make a decision if we can be open for business tomorrow (Monday) or even HOW to handle a no-business day.  HR does not have a hard copy of a master contact list to call employees to let them know that we will not be open tomorrow.  It took me to tell the Finance Director that I cannot restore power and we have to wait for Dominion Power to fix it. She thinks I am ""fixing"" it.  She has called me several times this weekend on the ""status"".  Dumbass.  The CEO has authorized to put up a message on our company website that due to the power outage, we cannot do phone and email support.  The Marketing Director, who manages the website, told me to do it.  I refused as I have much more important things to do.  If I do it, it will be a rage comic image.  The CFO's only contribution is

So I am at my wits end with this company and their bullshit.  Yes, but having a company DR is another and they need to be responsible for it.  

So

**[UPDATE]**

Tasker saved me a trip.  Got the email that the power had been restored.  20 minutes drive back to the office and met up with my Jr. Admins.  We were able to badge right into the office as opposed to the noclip-wallhacks I had to do to get in (I have the master key). 

The servers are up and the KVM VM's are swinging back over.  Email and AD related stuff seems to be good to go too.  

The only thing that crapped out was a non-essential switch

I just got off the phone with the CEO and he is relieved.  I ripped the bandaide off and blasted him over the fact that no one outside of IT made any effort to assess the situation as a true DR.  ""What? Were you going to wait until Monday morning to have HR communicate with the employees?  What if the power didn't come back on?""

He plans on having a high level staff meeting about this.  He did say that in terms of IT

Honestly, then I will give them my resignation right then and there.  I have another job lined up anyways.

**[UPDATE 2]**
Lost one server in the mix.  Capacitor on an old DL360 popped and rendered the motherboard useless.  I do not have similar hardware so I am currently running one of the drives from a RAID1 on another server and imaging it with Acronis and then virtualize it.  

I just got out of a staff meeting with senior management and I asked the important question of where is the official Business Continuity Planning (BCP).  I got ""deer in the headlights"" look from everyone.  The CTO (yes

Yesterday between 2-3pm EDT

(insert 5 minute actual pause in the typing)  Life lesson: don't count your chickens before.  We thought we had one of the PC's clean

Ok back to the story.. So I was on the line with Symantec and I started seeing some weird crap on one of my network shares

Within a few minutes

I started going 'oh shit

A quick look at the shares and then a fast google brought me to the ""[Sexy](http://angelcom.com/virus-changes-all-folders-to-exe-files-and-hides-folders-and-files/#.UcILDrHD-70)"" (link to page that talks about removing it) virus.

Basically

So once we realized this

We ended up finding about 10 infected PC's, x.mpeg, autorun.inf that were created at the top level of all shares.  Luckily for us, this virus only targeted files and folders at the top level. of the share.

We were cleaning PC's until about 7p lastnight, clean again, until we rebooted and got a scan w/ no results; then we would reconnect to the network and watch the user's open share sessions to verify that it was good.

At that point, reset the user's password (just in case) and left for the night.

This morning

Anyways, I need to look at our ForeFront Online Exchange Filtering to figure out why the virus ridden email got through (pretty certain it started from an infected email attachment), and Forefront AV sucks - time to look for something better - Vipre, Sophos, Kaspersky, etc...


**Edit:**  So as of noon, the other three randomly sprouted into one of the many 'fake antivirus' style viruses, while they werent even on the network (go figure).  We were able to get all but two of those fully cleaned, the last two will be reimaged either today or tomorrow.

We have also confirmed, I'm going to contact MS FOPE support to have it checked out, and help me identify what I need to do to prevent emails spoofed as our domain from getting through their filters.


**Edit 2**  Found a copy of the file attachment, I was able to find the message ID and I'll be contacting FOPE support probably tomorrow morning to get assistance in making sure that I have our filtering set up optimally, and find out why this one got thorugh.

After someone's advice on here

1341688882.0,w6t2s,More discussion on the upcoming ban on images,bandman614,150,59,113,"The mods have discussed this topic a lot. 

The general consensus by the moderators (the only people who see all of the image submissions) is that about 1:10 straight image posts are valuable in that they contribute either constructive ideas or discussion. The rest only tend to produce upvotes, they're taking up valuable space for actual, thought-provoking content. That's not what any of the moderators of the want, because it doesn't provide any value to you, the readers (or to us, for that matter). 

What we have done up until now has been to manually remove them. Since we don't have 24-hour moderators sitting by waiting to judge whether an image post is valuable or not, we have been missing more and more. Some of the posts we miss are fine, but most aren't, and all of the moderators feel bad removing something with 60 upvotes regardless of whether it adds anything to the subreddit. 

To try to skirt the issue of removing crap  posts that have high vote counts, it's going to be automatically removed. It might have been a crap image, or it might have been a really interesting image. Our automoderator script won't know. 

Because we want to encourage good images while discouraging bad images, with short write-up of background information. 

Want an example? OK. The best example I can think of is the submission, the submitter [Psykiv](http://www.reddit.com/user/psykiv) wrote: 
&gt;I can't give this to the client. Seriously
The client is going to think I sold them a ghetto bootleg copy.

Social services.  Hospitals, community outreach.  Those places where my skills will be benefiting the people around me more than making them a buck or two extra.  Somewhere that I can walk in and know that if I do a good job, I'll be supporting people that help support others.  I like that idea.

For those who are curious...

First of all, the web interface is pretty much exactly the same as 5.x (just a different color scheme). Adding/removing users is virtually exactly the same as in previous BES', albeit the mail delivery architecture has changed substantially.

The BES server no longer talks directly to Exchange via. MAPI. The BES server is essentially just an MDM server which uses activesync, it provisions everything and sets up ActiveSync on the phone for the user (and prompts for their AD password).

Beyond that, there was literally hundreds of policies, in the new BES 10 there's maybe about 50 policies. You can control all of the basics, and the basics of the BB10 platform (eg. BB Balance), but it's nowhere near what the old BES was policy-wise. What has improved, though, is they've re-jiggered/added Wifi and VPN profiles

Adding/pushing apps seems to be a lot easier

Overall

I also installed the 'Management Studio', it's literally just a fancier website (although you're supposed to be able to tie your old bes and iOS/Android MDM servers into it)...

As far as the BB10 itself goes... It's alright, there isn't really much reason to go with it, versus a iOS/Android device with MDM or ActiveSync. Most of the bits of the phone are pretty smooth, the browser is (dare I say) excellent (this is coming from a iOS/Safari fan). If the app selection improves, it could very well be a reasonably competitive platform... But that's a big if... It's still a modern, capable platform though, and seems very well polished. 

I'm happy to answer any questions sysadmin has... seeing as it looks like I'm going to be stuck on BB10 (again

Gonna get an edit in here. 

I've spoken with the other owner, nor do I have any concrete proof that there actually was an issue. I believe this is a case of a customer trying to get out of paying a contract, but that's a different story entirely.

I spoke with HR, and expressed concern at not having any knowledge of the issue herself, as she's the HR department for the company. I believe I will use this to my advantage.

I am in talks with several recruiters and a few users from here who have requested resume information to forward to employers. I have, I needed to get into another job.
