I propose r/askphilosophy be created. An open place for folks to ask real live working philosophers questions of and about philosophy.

Here are mine:

* **The *'it's all relative'* aphorism.**  I dislike hearing, and has a profound understanding of the arguments in favor of moral relativism.
* **That Philosophy is inexorably intertwined with God.**  Often times when I tell friends and family I study Philosophy, I just don't care as much as people expect.
* **That we're 'experts in nothing'.** Recently I saw Lawrence Krauss and Richard Dawkins discuss Krauss' new book at ASU.  In the interview, 'nothing'.  He responds that Philosophers are 'experts' in nothing.  Throughout the interview, however, he engages in metaphysics, cites Bertrand Russell, and talks about the 'Anthropic Principle'.  Nothing annoys me more than pop-scientists who disparage Philosophy all while relying on it and performing it.

I know this may not be very interesting to all of you

Thanks.

We have created a [screencast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KgqCTrnb2Oo) for you to see what the website is all about before registering.

The only information required to sign up is a .edu email address(to verify you are a student).

1322157547.0,mo27p,Comments requested on a new draft of my book--Replacing Truth,Kevin_Scharp,38,9,14,"It's coming out with Oxford next year

[Here](http://people.cohums.ohio-state.edu/scharp1/ReplacingTruth4.3.pdf) is the pdf.  

Below is a summary (from the Introduction).  

Chapter One is a brief survey of work on truth in the analytic tradition.  The goal is present a novel way of thinking about the literature rather than an introduction to the particular views out there, and logical approaches to the aletheic paradoxes.  Logical approaches offer a mathematical model for our language and truth predicate, while philosophical approaches provide an empirical interpretation of the mathematical model.  The distinction is not new, but without it, one is likely to be confused about which theories are genuine rivals.  Once these three types of theories are on the table, I consider combinations of philosophical approaches and logical approaches; then the focus turns to what I call unified theories of truth, which include a view on the nature of truth, and a logical approach as components.  

On my view, which I call the obvious argument, is the most intuitive and accessible.  The other three arguments depend on considerations that arise in conjunction with revenge paradoxes, which are ubiquitous and affect approaches to the aletheic paradoxes.  In Chapter Five, I present some of the views that fall in the inconsistency tradition and argue that each one is unacceptable.  The main point of this chapter is that an inconsistency approach to the aletheic paradoxes should offer replacements for truth.  

We need to replace our inconsistent concept of truth with two concepts, one can use them as the basis for a theory of our inconsistent concept of truth itself.  Thus, there are really two essential parts to the view I recommend.  First, there is the prescriptive theory, which explains the replacement concepts.  It says how we should expand our conceptual repertoire and provides reasons to think that this expansion will not just result in the same old problems we find with truth.  Second, there is the descriptive theory, which explains our defective concept of truth—what principles it obeys and why it gives rise to paradoxes.  One of the fundamental commitments of the entire project is that the descriptive theory should not appeal to the concept of truth; instead, Chapter Six contains the prescriptive theory and explains how the replacement concepts work.  This prescriptive theory amounts to a logical approach and a philosophical approach to the aletheic paradoxes.   Chapter Seven presents a view on the nature of truth that is based on metrological naturalism.  It introduces some measurement theory and shows how to understand Davidson’s theory of truth in light of this material.  Finally, it gives an overview of the relations among the concepts of ascending truth and descending truth and many of the concepts that are closely tied to truth, knowledge

The central claim of the prescriptive theory is that, ascending truth and descending truth, instead of truth.  Ascending truth is like truth in that the inference from a declarative sentence p to ‘p is ascending true’ is valid.  It differs from truth in that the inference ‘p is ascending true’ to p is not always valid (although it is valid for the vast majority of sentences).  Descending truth is like truth in that the inference from ‘p is descending true’ to p is valid for any declarative sentence.  However, it differs from truth in that the inference from p to ‘p is descending true’ is not always valid (although, again, it is valid for the vast majority of sentences).  Together, ascending truth and descending truth can do the work we require of truth without giving rise to paradoxes of any kind.  Moreover, and it imposes no expressive restrictions on the languages that contain ascending truth predicates and descending truth predicates.  

Chapter Nine introduces the descriptive theory, but its extension (i.e., the set of things that are true) depends on a context of assessment.  Contexts of assessment model situations in which a person interprets someone’s utterance.  From different contexts of assessment, the truth predicate has different extensions.  The descriptive theory employs the concepts of ascending truth and descending truth, and they determine how the extension of the truth predicate varies across contexts of assessment.  This assessment-sensitive theory of truth solves the aletheic paradoxes, it is compatible with classical logic and all the expressive resources we have in natural language, and it does not give rise to any new paradoxes.  Chapter Ten considers issues that arise for a language that has a truth predicate, and a descending truth predicate.  It also contains some objections and replies to the unified theory of truth that consists of the prescriptive theory (consisting of the philosophical approach, and Eight) and the descriptive theory (consisting of the philosophical approach

When we consider related questions and topics, like what was going on with the slabs and pointing in the *Investigations* - felt like it had nothing to do with Plato or half the other philosophy I was trying to read. I couldn't get a sense of why philosophy was a field.

Now that I've read a ton

But that's cheating. I went to particular interpretations of particular texts and jammed two accounts together. They may be about ethics

And that ""framing the issue"" is important, anywhere. I've worked with enough students to know the better ones have talking points that are reliable for tests and answering professors and maybe even the odd person curious about one's work. But the heart of philosophy is coming up with a question, talking through it, realizing how many other questions there are. 

I think the linkdump approach to this subreddit is important

But I also think the linkdump approach is overwhelming more than a few of us. It's tough to critically engage everything and that can be very discouraging.

But ""prison"" got me thinking on another level about disgust - not just as a convention which bonds a society, but the worry that getting used to some things can dull all moral sense, maybe even all sense.

These are some considerations about the text

* The work is 25 chapters. More fundamentally though, Chapter 25). Therefore,

Chapters 1-4:     Part 1

Chapters 5-8:     Part 2

Chapters 9-12:   Part 3

Chapters 13-16: Part 4

Chapters 17-20: Part 5

Chapters 21-24: Part 6

Chapter 25:       Part 7

* The four part structure is a reflection of Schopenhauer's ""Fourfold Root of Sufficient Reason."" This is easiest seen in Part 1

Chapter 1: Character of Apollo (principium individuationis)  = Becoming

Chapter 2: Character of Dionysus                                      = Knowing

Chapter 3: Apollonian Culture (the gods called Olympians)   = Being

Chapter 4: Dionysian Culture (either Titans or Barbarians)   = Willing

* Chapter 4 concludes with Nietzsche claiming ""four major artistic periods."" Quote:

""Up to this point I have set out at some length what I observed at the opening of this essay: how the Dionysian and the Apollonian ruled the Hellenic world in a constantly new sequence of births, out of the “first” age, with its battles against the Titans and its austere popular philosophy, the Homeric world developed under the rule of the Apollonian drive for beauty; how this “naive” magnificence was swallowed up once more by the breaking out of the Dionysian torrent; and how, in opposition to this new power, the Apollonian erected the rigid majesty of Doric art and the Doric world view. If in this way the earlier history of the Greeks, in the struggle of those two hostile principles, we are now impelled to ask more about the final stage of this development and striving, the one of Doric art

* In the first period,"" is, ""out of the ""bronze"" age...,"" which I see as fitting the Schopenhauerian framework better because it captures the transition from matter, which concerns the first root of sufficient reason, to abstract concepts, which concerns the second root), we experience how Apollo is both creator and parcel of the Olympians via ""naivete

* The seven part composition is Nietzsche's understanding of Plato's ""Symposium, Eryximachus, Aristophanes, Agathon, Socrates, and Alcibiades) This leads me to ""Phaedrus.""

* ""The Birth of Tragedy"" is a modern interpretation of Plato's ""Phaedrus."" Really

Comparisons:

* Chapter 1

* Chapter 1, in the paragraph following the above, Nietzsche expresses the need to have experience with sights and sounds of suffering like poverty and sorrow.

* Chapter 5

I'll end here for now. Anyway

&gt;But as Plato's dialogues explained it

This is incorrect

* Aristocracy (rule of the excellent/virtuous)
* Timocracy (rule of the honourable)
* Oligarchy (rule of the wealthy)
* Democracy (rule of the many and their many unchecked desires)
* Tyranny (rule by the most licentious)

&gt;""The one that is praised by the many, the one called oligarchy, a regime filled with throngs of evils; and this regime’s adversary...democracy; and then the noble tyranny at last, excelling all these, the fourth and extreme illness of a city...Therefore if there are five arrangements of cities, there would also be five for the soul of private men...well, we have already described the man who is like the aristocracy

Description of democracy (557):

&gt;""In the first place, this regime, decorated with all dispositions, would also look fairest, and many perhaps...like boys and women looking at many-coloured things would judge this to be the fairest regime...in absence of any compulsion to rule in this city...or to make war...or to keep peace...the absence of any compulsion keeping you from ruling and being a judge anyhow, if you long to do so - isn’t such a way of passing the time divinely sweet for the moment?""

&gt;""How magnificently it tramples all this underfoot and doesn’t care at all from what kinds of practices man goes to political action, a fugitive; calling moderation cowardliness and spattering it with mud they banish it; persuading that measure and orderly expenditure are rustic and illiberal, they join with many useless desires in driving them over the frontier...once they have emptied and purged these from the soul of the man whom they are seizing and initiating....they proceed to return insolence, anarchy, wastefulness, and shamelessness from exile in a blaze of light...extolling and flattering them by calling insolence good education; anarchy, freedom; wastefulness, changes from his rearing in necessary desire to the liberation and unleashing of unnecessary and useless pleasures?""

&gt;[563]""That a father...habituates himself to be like his child and fear his sons, the young copy their elders and compete with them in speeches and deeds while the old come down to the level of the young...so that they wont seem to be unpleasant or despotic.""

&gt;""Do you notice how tender they make the citizen’s soul, written or unwritten, in order that they may avoid having any master at all...this is the beginning, so fair and heady, from which tyranny in my opinion naturally grows...too much freedom seems to change into nothing but too much slavery, both for private man and city.""

I am an undergrad who is finishing up a seminar on Later Heidegger. I chose to write on The Question Concerning Technology for my final paper

**Edit: If anybody wants a copy of the final version of the paper

 ...

&gt;It goes without saying that Heidegger thought of technology pejoratively. The technological thinking he bore witness to during his lifetime was perilous for mankind. Technology, I believe) the revealing of our worlds to us, and in a way that infringes upon authenticity and thinking. I offer a continuation of Heidegger’s thinking in this essay: I want to argue that technology today has a new, more dangerous character compared to the way that Heidegger describes it. This argument should not be construed as critical, or in opposition to Heidegger’s thought- for starters, I am no historian, nor did I experience the world at the time Heidegger experienced it. Hence, however, and contrast that with what I believe is now happening- all ordering is determined by economics

The Enlightenment period of philosophy brought us the notion that human history has been progressing towards an ultimate goal

Post-modernism, claiming that there is no teleological end game, so to speak, and that this idea of history as a progression is a misconception. Instead, it's been suggested, by philosophers such as Lyotard and Derrida, that what we're dealing with is not so much a teleological synthesis of oppositions, but a sort of amorphous web of interconnected points of view, does not make sense.

Along with this interpretation of history and progression, can justify and legitimize our scientific pursuits?
Does giving up the Enlightenment notion of a teleological progression make the scientific community more vulnerable to anti-science rhetoric?

Davidson isn't satisfied with the compositional view that words have meanings which are then merged somehow into the new meaning of a sentence. He also says the mechanics by which sentences refer to a given ""state-of-affairs"" is murky. Yet languages must make accuracte statements, they would not be learnable.

What Davidson suggests is that langauge evolves out of true statements. So, that this statement is ""true."" If this is the case, then whatever I say in the future about ""snow"" and ""white,"" assuming I wish to make true statements, must bear some relation to the true statement I made earlier. (I have a feeling this goes beyond what Davidson says in the paper...) Thus a language containing novel sentences can be formulated, given that ""snow is cold"" and ""snow is white,"" if they are to be true sentences

This is how I've been making sense of it, the ""true"" and ""false"" quantifies must exist only within a metalanguage. But what role can that serve in natural languages when we are discussing meaning? To my understanding, we line up two sentences, S is true if and only if p, where S is a statement in the object language and p is a statement in the metalanguage, which also contains the truth predicate. What's difficult for me is what this correspondence between languages is supposed to accomplish as far as meaning is concerned. Is is not simpler to say ""Let 'snow is white' be true."" and proceed from there?

I hope I've been clear enough with my problem. Any help?",self,t5_2r7v0,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/AcademicPhilosophy/comments/iwym6/can_somebody_help_me_get_a_handle_on_davidsons/

Abstract. This paper criticizes two forms of philosophical materialism that adopt opposite strategies but end up in the same place. Both hold that individual entities must be banished from philosophy. The first kind is ground floor materialism, which treats objects as naive fictions gullibly posited behind the direct accessibility of appearances or relations; here, objects are portrayed as too deep to be the truth. One major thesis of this paper is that these two forms of materialism are parasitical on one another and need each other’s resources to make sense of the world. The second major thesis is that both forms of materialism thereby stand condemned, and that philosophy must be rebuilt from the individual objects that the two forms of materialism disdain. These points are made through a detailed consideration of the book Every Thing Must Go by the analytic structural realists James Ladyman and Don Ross, which has gained a surprising following among some speculative realists in continental philosophy. Ladyman and Ross claim to preserve objects by treating them as “real patterns”, but they do so at the price of destroying their autonomous reality. Furthermore, they are unable to tell us whether the mathematical structures they see as the basis of human knowledge are also the basis of reality itself. In short

1294353674.0,exiyd,Requesting more primary and secondary sources (.pdf and Scribd welcome); some thoughts for those new to philosophy,ashok,17,3,5,"I. As for the first part of the title

&gt;Also

I'm not complaining about what everyone is submitting. I enjoy what you're posting. I'm envious of many of the links you find. But there are several virtues to reposting links to things like Russell's ""The Problems of Philosophy"" (which tends to show up every so often on the philosophical reddits). First, if I had known about Russell's ""The Problems of Philosophy"" when an undergrad, it would have helped greatly. Classes sometimes have a knack for keeping one away from the texts that make things clearer.

II. I know a few of you are brand new to philosophy. You've subscribed to this subreddit hoping for some kind of introduction. Occasionally you speak up and get a bunch of recommendations

I'll let the commentariat destroy what I'm about to say, epistemology (theory of knowledge, nowadays ""first philosophy""), how language works, philosophy of science, philosophy of mathematics, and a bunch of other topics. An example of continental philosophy is the work of Heidegger

Most of what you see in the academy is analytic philosophy, we read G.E. Moore's ""Proof of an External World,"" an essay by Ayer defending knowledge as true, justified belief, and the essay by Gettier in which he showed how ""justified"" can become a serious problem for defining knowledge as true, justified belief. All of that I could understand. It was the hundred or so other essays making claims about probability, the nature of counterfactuals, etc. responding to Gettier that got out of hand for me.

I'm telling you this story so you understand what you're getting on Reddit. It's a range of links

So you need two things if you're new to all of this: 

1) the ability to get background knowledge to ""fill in gaps"" before and during reading. This has been made considerably simpler by things like Wikipedia. My own recommendation is that you should find a cheap copy of Oxford's ""Philosophy 1"" (ed. Grayling). It doesn't get into how complex some of the contemporary debate gets. But that complexity is something you're always going to be confronting

2) Familiarity with some more basic, starting with the Euthyphro or Either/Or is a good way to go crazy fast. The idea here is that while ""getting started,"" you're getting your reading skills in shape. Reading philosophy is hard. As most readers of my blog know, I still can't get things right half the time, and I've been doing this for years. The texts I recommend if you're brand new to philosophy:

*Sartre

*Nietzsche

*Russell

*Marx and Engels

*Karl Popper

Again, but the payoff is huge. You get more out of what you read generally. I'm sure you'll get plenty of recommendations in the comments like the ones above.

If you've made it this far, please don't get frustrated with how things look on reddit sometimes. The whole point of this place is the community. We're here to help. Please do spread the word about this subreddit.

TL;DR - please submit more primary &amp; secondary literature (.pdf/scribd welcome). If you're new to philosophy entirely,False,self,t5_2r7v0,True,,,t3_exiyd

&gt; The thinking Arendt demands requires pride, and does not shirk from Arendt’s belief that a confidence in one’s own distinctiveness is necessary for character. **Like Emerson’s, Arendt’s writing celebrates self-reliance.** For her, our democratic desire for equality—to be the same as others and to not judge them—compounds the problem of thoughtlessness. [source](http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/05/30/lonely-thinking-hannah-arendt-on-film/) (my emphasis)

I did a cursory search online,"" an essay for the anthology *Thinking in Dark Times.* In this paper, Berkowitz states:
&gt; There may be no thinker in the canon of political thinking more attuned to the political relevance of the dignity of the solitary thinker than Ralph Waldo Emerson. Emersonian self reliance is possessed by those who follow the inflexible string that colloquially is called one’s backbone. Trust thyself, to take up the divine idea allotted to each one of us, resonates with Arendt’s Socratic
imperative

So here's my situation: my bachelors degree (graduating in April) is going to be in Literature and History; however, my ""passion."" The reason why I didn't get my undergraduate degree in Philosophy is that my university, being small, didn't offer it. 

In preparation, soaking up everything I possibly can. All of this study has been done in the spare time around my class schedule. But this self-education (if you will) has definitely led me to some preferences, particularly the continental Philosophers. I took up a pretty big interest in Marxism (and all of the branches, such as the Frankfurt School), and also an interest in the Phenomenology of Heidegger. I've actually been considering doing a research paper on a (late) Heideggerian reading of Marxism as a writing sample for applications. 

Also, I only got As and Bs, and have gotten Straight As the past two semesters. Unfortunately, though, because of the first year and a half, my collective GPA will probably only be about a 3.4. 

So, et cet)? Is there anyway to show in the application process that I have independently studied the history of philosophy, or is it all going to come down to my writing sample? 

**Edit: I just wanted to say I sincerely appreciate the input.

My main problem is probably how the theory relates to our current understanding of science and matter.

In a little under a month I have a 5000 word, and will be looking to Camus (The Myth of Sisyphus) and Sartre for some additional reading.  

I want to explore the existentialist idea of hope and how this is addressed in Kafka's writings (if at all).  Our general notion of hope is heavily influenced by religious culture, and expectation.  If you look at this notion of hope in the light of existential philosophy, you're faced with a rather interesting situation. For most existentialists there is no God, no afterlife, thus life has no meaning in and of itself -- the assignment of meaning is left up to the individual.   When faced with this realization, life (as Camus would say) becomes absurd.  The existentialist notion of time is also different.  The present moment is the only time which can be affected, so the idea of 'hope for the future' is nothing but an illusion.

These are just some of my preliminary thoughts

What do you think hope is for an existentialist?
What further readings would you suggest?
What are your thoughts on the idea of hope in the face of a meaningless existence?

And so now I'm curious, ontology, and epistemology. Iain M. Banks' Culture novels deal with political philosophy, especially regarding war and colonialism and whether man must be governed.

Then you also have the French existentialists, etc., deal with how man deals living in a meaningless world. Kierkegaard also did this with _Either/Or_, although I haven't read it so can't comment.

Then I suppose you can also include novels such as Daniel Quinn's _Ishmael_ or Douglas Adam's _God's Debris_, and I want to get at something distinct.

Following is a pasted copy of our English call for papers. And

----------------------------------------------------

Keynote Speakers:

Noël Carroll

Daniel Dumouchel

The theme of the conference is aesthetic experience

*	Why do we experience some objects as beautiful and others not?

*	What separates aesthetic experiences from meaningful everyday experiences? Is there a distinction between the two?

*	What is the role and relation of emotions to aesthetic experiences?

*	What is the relation between the aesthetic experience and works of art? Is it necessary or contingent for works of art to provide an aesthetic experience?

*	How does this experience change us

*	How can this experience be explained psychologically, or socially?

Historical papers should explicate what previous thinkers, or art critics, have held regarding this topic.


Papers both in English and French language are accepted. This bilingual conference encourages academic papers from different disciplines, literature, film studies, psychology, and philosophy. Professors and graduate students are requested to submit only a title and a 100-word abstract of the paper in .doc, .docx, .rtf

The submission deadline is Tuesday
 
If there are any general questions concerning the conference

The argument starts on page 18 and ends on page 23. 

I think I disagree with his third premise: Facts about bare difference cannot entail facts about qualitative content. 

He tries to use an example about orange being a pattern of bare difference between red and yellow, because the relevant pattern of bare difference necessary to entail orange doesn't reside in patterns of bare difference about photons, but rather patterns of bare differences about which neurons get activated. Simply, the patterns of bare difference of blue and green do not generate orange because they do not activate the same parts of the brain as the red and yellow photons when arranged in that pattern.

I'm hoping to get into a Ph.D. program for philosophy (applying to schools that are good for philosophy of religion, Loyola, Notre Dame, UNC Chapel Hill).  I took the GRE this week and did phenomenally on the Verbal Reasoning (750-800).  I was less impressive on the Quantitative reasoning (450 - 550).  I have no idea yet how the Analytic section went, but for the sake of this question, let's assume I did well.

Despite the great Verbal score, and as anyone would have to grant, it's competitive to a ridiculous extent.  Most schools claim they have no cut-off score for the GRE...but I imagine most do.  I don't want to be swept off the pile before anyone even has a chance to see how my scores break down, or what my reference letters/writing sample look like.

So, earlier. Written from the perspective of a non-philosopher whose SO is a philosopher, it gives advice to the former on dealing with the latter. Oh, and does anyone have any other blog recommendations? So far, I just have this and Leiter.

To the more serious point: I'm about to graduate, to determine the 'ranking bracket' (I'm going by phil.gourmet -- is there any other worthwhile ranking?) towards which I should direct the majority of my applications? Sometimes I feel like I'm top-ten material; other times, I feel like I'd be lucky to get into a top-forty. Is it inappropriate to ask current/former graduate students to share the writing sample that they used with their application?

I know there's a lot of graduate-school-application-related posts floating around this subreddit, and appreciated. I'm sure you all remember what a terrifying moment in one's philosophical career this is.

Anyway

* The aforelinked blog is rather entertaining.
* Anyone have any other blogs they'd like to share?
* Generally
* Specifically

Thank you!

But I digress, so this is an aspirational - rather than an instructional - post. Nonetheless, it's a useful contrast, I believe, to look at some of the ideas regarding poetry and art of the classical times in order to have them lie in relief against our own pervasive beliefs about those same concepts. I hope someone here can benefit from these bare beginnings of research on the classic text about poetry and drama.

Here's a collection of places to start; many recently posted here at AP

1293981744.0,euy9b,Fine tuning? (A question from a confused layman),2downvotes,12,3,32,"Essentially my question is this: Why is the idea of a fine tuned universe taken seriously by modern scientists and philosophers?  Why does the now-cliche ['shuffled cards'](http://wiki.ironchariots.org/index.php?title=Anthropic_principle#False_premise_p1:_Frames_of_reference) example not apply?  

Here is the background to my question:
I have a religious background that leans towards the fundamentalist end of christianity.  I rejected my faith a few years ago after examining my beliefs and finding nothing that stood up to simple critical thinking.  At the time one of the arguments in favour of creationism which had been drilled into me through the years was fine tuning.  The idea being that when examined, and was a result of seeing human life as more special than it really is (or more 'statistically significant').  I figured that a life-supporting universe was just one of an unthinkable number of ways the universe could have turned out, and marvelling at the fact that the nature of the universe seems to have worked out pretty well for us makes no sense, because there is no reason to think that this particular configuration of the universe or life itself is somehow special.  I actually considered fine tuning to be one of the weaker arguments I had been taught.

Then, I still have no idea why this idea is seen to have merit, or why people feel the need to invoke ideas like multiple universes to deal with the problem.  Everyone seems to be seeing some sort of inconsistency where I see none.

Thank you in advance for your time :) this problem has been a very irritating itch in the back of my mind for some time and I very much appreciate any help.  I hope I have been clear and have avoided saying anything too stupid.

EDIT: I just found [this article](http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/theodore_drange/tuning-revisited.html) which does a very good job of summarising what I see as the problems with the fine tuning argument.  The one of most interest to me is number 4.

EDIT#2: ignatiusloyola has made me aware that there could be confusion among theoretical physicists over the related but distinct term [""Fine Tuning""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning).  This thread is about the other type of fine tuning
