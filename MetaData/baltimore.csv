1367292011.0,1ddywz,Throwaway time... Have you ever been in the Baltimore Detention Center? What was it like? Maybe NSFW,detainedinbmore,1197,273,1341,"I won't post anything about why I was in there

It's incredibly boring with bursts of extreme fear. Everyone in there just talks about crime, with exception to a few individuals...

When I was initially in holding (where you go after they take your stuff and get you to fill out paperwork) a skinny white guy with face tattoos was explaining how I should handle inquiries about my gang affiliation. He said I should associate with the whiteboy gang... alright. After that I got moved into a larger (think 10'x10') cement room with 8-9 other people. It was around 4-5am I'd say at this point, tossing and turning trying to get comfortable on the cement slabs that you had to sleep on. The lights never turn off in this area... And there are always yells, buzzers, or chatter outside of the cell, which had a big glass window. Some dudes were calling me names, so I acted like I was asleep... I didn't want to get into a jail fight lol...

After what seemed like forever, crotch, and cough naked... You know, just in-case I had some heroin and a cellphone in my ass... It's degrading. Here's when you finally get that one phone call. If you're like me, and use a cellphone which stores all of your freinds/families numbers, you could easily be fucked. It doesn't help that right behind you people are bitching about you taking too much time. It's definitely interesting to ease-drop on other peoples calls... About how they screwed up again and need to make bail again... or brag about their crime, and how they didn't snitch

My story is probably a little different from here on out

The cell was around 12'x12', which consisted of a really terrible lunchmeat sandwich, a plastic bag of juice, and a cookie. Everything was stale, and contained no nutritional value... I wasn't in the place to complain though.

As for the people I spent this time with, and told everyone willing to listen about how he was simply walking around in his neighborhood, helping his brother move when the cops caught him with heroin. 

Another dude was apparently some kind of bounty hunter that was wanted on multiple warrents... Fortunately he was really relaxed. 

There was another guy on $500, he had some kind of crazy gun charges, assaulting the police, and other crimes. Another guy was losing his mind, and being extremely hostile to anyone who looked at him the wrong way. He would think he recognized people who stole from him on the streets, and begin to start fights with them. Then he told me how 92Q had a conspiracy to kill him. 

The other inmates would taunt and flirt with the C/O's

Fortunately I got out not too long after that. All-in-all I didn't join the general population, like it was part of their life. They knew they would be back after they got out.

I got out later at night

Reddit

EDIT: As for the visuals, some from the 1980's from former prisoners, and sometimes RIP's. The gang tags are unlike any cryptic language I've seen before though, it's a lot of Illuminati style symbols, like pyramids and eyes. By the phones, and even in the holding cells people will scribble down the numbers of bail-bonds places. That's actually who I called when I had my one phonecall.

First one was a trek mountain bike in flat black.  Black everything.  Had a water bottle cage and a pump on it.  it was a model 3700.

Second one was a trek trail bike.  Taller.  I think 54cm.  tan and green with a black saddle.  front fork had shocks.  it was a trek multitrack 7400.

they were taken from my garage sometime this morning.  I live just north of union memorial hospital.  so my best guess is someone from govens or waverly.  if you live around this area, etc, help me out please.  If you see them, call the police with their location.  they have been reported stolen so the police will know where to bring them.  if you could also let me know, that would be great.

&gt;Question 6 is a Maryland state referendum filed to challenge the law that would legalize same-sex marriage in the state. The Civil Marriage Protection Act, protect clergy from having to perform any particular marriage ceremony in violation of their religious beliefs, and affirm that each religious faith has exclusive control over its own theological doctrine regarding who may marry within that faith, effective January 1, 2013. The referendum will ask voters in the state to vote ""For"" or ""Against"" the law and will be held November 6, 2012 during the state general election. -- [Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maryland_Question_6_%282012%29), from Wikipedia

Much of the social media based commentary frames the issues as how is the *city government* going to fix this. Therein lies the crux of the issue. Significant change won’t come from the top

Here are some ways you can actually influence what is happening in your city right now:

1 - [Register to vote](http://elections.state.md.us/voter_registration/index.html) and then actually go to the polls for the **local** elections.

Only [72, primaries are a big deal in this city, since only [46,814](http://www.baltimorecity.gov/Government/BoardsandCommissions/ElectionsBoard/PastElectionResults.aspx) votes were cast in the 2011 mayoral general election. Your vote does make a difference. 

&gt; 

2 - Find your neighborhood’s website/Facebook/Twitter/Nextdoor.

You can easily read up on what events are happening in your area and then go meet your neighbors. You are all likely to be dealing with the same issues. 

&gt; 

3 - Go to a community meeting. 

LiveBaltimore has a list of neighborhoods and [many of the profiles](http://www.livebaltimore.com/neighborhoods/list/) include information on how to contact your community leaders. Your community association want to hear from you

&gt; 

3b - If none of those resources exist for you

Set up a [Nextdoor](http://nextdoor.com), Meetup, or hold a real block party. [Greater Homewood Community Corporation](http://www.greaterhomewood.org/) assists people and organizatins with community initiatives, although their focus is the north portion of the city.

We decided to take advantage of the whole Aquarium/Science Center being only $1 thing. We parked a little farther up by Fayette and Baltimore St. and walked down to the Harbor. 

As we were passing the Gallery (mall) these two younger black kids, an older black gentleman, who may or may not have known them, with a stern, loud voice shouted, ""**Not in front of the GOD DAMN child.**"" And they immediately froze and let us walk by.

I guess I'm sharing the story because I've never encountered anything like this. I've seen countless fights in Baltimore, I really was amazed at this man's watching over our little girl as if she were his own and I wish I could see more of it in Baltimore.

Last week I carelessly dropped my wallet outside of my car in Fells Point and didnt realize that I had dropped it.  When I went searching for it about an hour later I discovered a note on my windshield to call ""James"" and he would return my wallet.  Not only did he return my wallet

Last night after I got home from work I accidentally left my interior light on in my car.  When I went to go to work today I was stuck with a dead battery and a set of jumper cables.  Unfortunately I dont have many close friends in Baltimore, Drew, stopped to offer his assistance.  He gave up thirty minutes of his day to charge my batter to start my car.  I was absolutely amazed that all these people stopped to help a complete stranger in need.

I'm generally self-reliant

I am entering my last semester of dental hygiene school, and it only costs $20. I can take x-rays if you are due for them as well, and they only cost $5-25 depending on what you may need ($5 is most common). My school is located in Dundalk, and appointments are about 3 hours long. They are long because we do many preliminary assessments and our faculty checks our work very carefully. I have appointments on Monday and Friday afternoons, from 1:15-4:30 and Wednesday mornings from 8:15-11:30.

I specifically need patients who haven't had a cleaning in a long time, etc. It is my last semester so the dirtier your teeth are, the better it is for me. But all are welcome. This is a great service, especially if you don't have dental insurance.

We have a DDS on site who will come over and take a look at your teeth and diagnose any cavities or things that may need treatment. We don't do restorative work at my school

I have worked on several redditors in the past, support your local dental hygiene student, and help me help you! 

Email me at lexideck@gmail.com and we can set something up!

I moved here from Indiana (by way of North Carolina) after I accepted a great job. But, I can't look back on the last few years and find too many positive moments. 
Literally the first night I moved into my new apartment there was a double shooting in the unit next door and since then there have been 5 more shootings in my area (no one injured but the Police came). I've found that the cost of living (rent, most of the people I meet are rude or won't talk to me at all, traffic is HORRIBLE and public transportation is a joke, and I feel very restricted to certain parts of the city due to problems with crime. For this last reason, Baltimore has actually become a very small place to live.

Baltimoreans, and I'll be here for a long time to come (whether I like it or not). What am I missing about Baltimore? Where can I find joy in this city?

I rent a basement studio apartment and have been there for almost a year. Since then

My apartment sits in the side of a hill and apparently there are cracks in the foundation. I found out when Sandy hit because I had 4 inches of water in my apartment in the course of a couple hours. I found out from the maintenance office that the apartment had flooded before I moved in and they opted not to pay to have the problem fixed. Since then

The people at the corporate office are the really shady ones. Each time the apartment floods

The flooding is the most egregious episode but they've been fucked up in other ways. When I moved in they promised I didn't have to sign a pet addendum and when the corporate office found out a couple months ago tried to go back on the verbal agreement. 

They use an awful towing company that has towed my car twice for having expired tags. The first time I was waiting for the stickers to come in the mail. The second time they just ignored the sign in the window verifying my temporary registration. They also purposely tow in the middle of the night so you can't catch them. When I brought it to the leasing office they said it was beyond their control even though they are the ones that contract the towing company.

At this point

I know this was a rant but my original intention was to warn anyone else from making the same mistake I did. The apartment next to mine floods as well and they are actively trying to rent it out again. I'm working on having the city condemn the building and I'm moving into a house next month so I'll be done with this nightmare soon. However

My next door neighbor and her husband are both retired, but I'm not sure he has adequate resources to be able to put her into a home or somewhere she can receive appropriate care.  I've talked to him many times, and I know she's on a lot of meds which for the most part make her manageable but otherwise a zombie.  I'm not sure on the particulars, but I believe there are times - generally at night - when her meds have worn off but she can't have more.  This is when she can become quite aggressive and belligerent.  We live in adjacent rowhomes, so it is quite obvious when this happens, and loud.  Last night for example, she banged, slammed

I have called the police on her once before when I saw her out in the street repeatedly kicking parked cars and trying to hit passing cars with a remote control

I am hoping somebody has some good advice, her husband, and my family.

They didn't succeed, and noticed our mopeds. He tried to pull one away then saw it was double-locked up to a post. I figure at this point he went back and told his gravitationally blessed friend to get a hack-saw and head over to attempt to steal it. 

This is where we got lucky. My friends and I had just left the house, 'cause people say dumb things to moped riders all the time. Not two seconds later, the skinny guy grabbed me from behind and pulled me off the moped, promptly grabbing it and attempting to run away. Little did he know, the fall bent the rear fender around the back wheel, jamming it in place. The moped wasn't rolling anywhere.

I hopped up fast as lightning, but he ended up wiggling free (drugs are crazy). While I was getting up, he grabbed the moped again, but luckily my other friend had turned around and saw what was going on. She ended up pushing the guy and breaking him free from the bike, giving me a perfect opportunity to continue the meet &amp; greet with my fists. 

He dodged the first swing, this could be bad... except I was wearing a full-faced motorcycle helmet. Not a thing was felt. Sorry. 

I landed another punch or two before he jumped back

* Him:*I gotta knife bro
* Me:**So do I

He saw me grab my blade from my pocket and begin to open it

Then, 450lbs) ~~running~~ hobbling towards me with a **hack-saw**. I turned to him at this point, and pulled my knife out (blade was still folded). I've never seen a fat man run so fast in my life, especially with his pants halfway down his legs. 

I made the mistake of not chasing these idiots

Let this be a warning to everyone in the Charles Village area and surrounding. Keep your bikes locked up

TL:DR; Attempted mugging

On paper, the standard of living is better, there are more restaurants and museums ... but after living here a little less than a year, I think Baltimore is such a better city.  I always made fun of Baltimore's nickname ""Charm City"" until recently.  I've really come to understand it.  

Everyone in D.C. sucks.  They're rude

You expect the power-walking, every waiter to be equally rude and condescending.

The other thing that bothers me is that, you either have to pay a really high rent, or live in the ghetto.  There's not a lot of ""in-between"" like there is in Baltimore.  

They also have no respect for crabcakes.  They put freakin avacado in them or some kind of nasty orange dressing.

I come back home whenever I get a chance.  With gas prices rising, is worrying.
