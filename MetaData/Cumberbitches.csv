In fairness, humble image. But regardless of anyone's interpretation of his feelings...

* **The term is the official name for his fans.** People who go to any community (Reddit, etc) and look for other fans of the man, will search for the term ""Cumberbitch."" It's good to keep that name so more people can find us and join in the appreciation of the man.

* **It's not meant to be derogatory or exclusionary.** It was meant to be a silly play-on-words (it only changes one letter of his last name), I hope men will forgive the term (see point 1) and join in the love.

* Lastly,000 subscribers to switch, en masse, to a new subreddit. Plus, a lot of time and effort has been put into constructing this community, advertising for it (in other subreddits, to garner attention; and PMing mods to get them to add us to their sidebars)

Pictures from the filming of Sherlock season 3 *are* allowed in this subreddit

If you submit a link/post/picture that contains any potential spoilers for the new season, etc. -- it is the last option). **Please also mark any spoiler posts as NSFW** (the option just before the flair). This is pretty standard across reddit, because the default for [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) is to *not* auto-expand NSFW images, so it tends to help ""hide"" those images for people who don't want to see them. So in general, if you see a post that's NSFW, pay attention to the title (or any tagged link flair) before clicking on it, if you don't want to see spoilers.

**For comments

If you can't remember one/both of these things down the road

*tone: friendly

No worries if anyone wasn't super-adherent to this policy in the past.

*tone: friendly

But going forward, **please report any non-tagged spoiler posts or comments you see** to help the mods tag or remove them more quickly.
