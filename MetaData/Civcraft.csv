This is better than I deserve right now. 

For more than a year now Civcraft has been my life

The irony of that limit being my own stupidity, maybe I am doing both at once and that is what this feeling is. 

I have put every ounce of my life into this game, I always did what I thought was best, I made the hard choices when no one else could and it tore my apart mind and body. Sleepless nights constant, , nervousness, lost time with friends and family. These costs are as much mine as any major player's. Every time I asked if it was worth it I dared to dream one more time that this could be everything I thought it could. 

But its not about me here, everything you have confided in the server, has been given away. I will never forgive myself for this and I will fully understand if you never forgive me for it and refuse to use any service I run ever again. 

As always I could man up and move forward, not that I think that would end too well.  

Regardless this is ttk2 signing off

1. HCF is multiple groups. But he can't tell you what the groups are or who's in what group.
2. He's no longer pearling innocents. But he can't tell you who he thinks is innocent and still wants to PvP with people who may or may not want to PvP.
3. Plz stahp h8ing dem. No real reason

Alright

HCF/WuTang/Neo-Hitlers:

I argued against the bans. I even argued for you guys to be able to play your style and accomplish your goals of ""pearling the ancaps/world police"". I thought the drama would be entertaining, per se.

Let me give you an analogy of what you guys are doing. Imagine this was a card game. Everyone here is playing Texas Hold 'Em. You guys come in and start throwing the cards all over the place saying ""we just want to play 52 pick up. Don't be mad dude

If you guys want to play pick up, play Hold 'Em with us. Those are your two options and there is no middle ground.

So what does this look like in CivCraft?
1. Stop fighting/pearling everyone unless they attack or harm you.
2. Pay reparations to those you have harmed.
3. Quit bitching about people hating you and actually build your reputation by being helpful.

You are responsible for your own reputation here and that of your group. If you act like assholes

If you guys want to keep ""playing your style"", mine and discuss politics. We accept that self defense is a part of this. People aren't here for another 2b2t.net or HCF server. That is the reality and why you are hated.

I'm not asking you to change or to continue what you're doing. That is up to you. I'm just giving you the reality of the situation.

Y_ankees,ChiefJusticeDredd,200,35,332,"Y_ankees is accused of using an aimbot PVP hack in order to hit players in a way that would not be possible using the vanilla client. The specific mechanic at issue is the ability to hit players without looking at them and without aiming manually. [The evidence put forth by kingr8 and others](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/17balc/evidence_and_accusations_against_y_ankees_for/) against Y_ankees was quite convincing. In [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJ_1lgE8hqk), invisible* (which ttk will confirm below in the comments). This is also

kingr8’s video is the primary piece of evidence considered. Y_ankees claims that what is seen on kingr8’s video is just lag, and kingr8’s client is just catching up with that information. While that narrative is admittedly plausible, a careful examination of the video reveals that in multiple cases, Y_ankees neither looks at kingr8 nor looks at anywhere kingr8 has been, and manages to hit him quite a few times, thus discounting lag as a factor.. Y_ankees also hits him while changing direction, and hits him while turning to face other opponents. This behavior is also not seen in the other characters caught by kingr8’s video

As corroborating evidence, several witnesses noted the same behavior from Y_ankees’ avatar. Woundedgod even notes in one video that Y_ankees hits him even when Y_ankees is running in the other direction. The fact that this statement was made *during* the heat of battle suggests that it is reliable, as he presumably did not have time to manufacture such a story.

The x-ray violation (which, as it would possibly hamper future investigations. It is also worth noting that Y_ankees was accused of x-raying before by both Foofed and smmdz, and while the evidence was ruled to be inconclusive, there was a strong suggestion of foul play in that case.

**The crimes are x-ray and aimbot hacking. The sentence is a ban.**

1354723490.0,14bs6j,"Seeking restitution from Laurelai, Foofed, and Tutterise",snailmaster1,190,485, pretty much tending to my own things.  Recently I have become involved in some drama involving Laurelai and a few others

-----------------------------------------

It started a few days ago when I was moving through the overworld trying to get to my base.  I had on my inventory 2 stacks of white wool, 2 stacks of red wool, 31 diamonds, iron armor, and a few miscellaneous supplies which I don't remember nor care about that much.  

Anyway, so I asked her if I could use her portal.  Instead, she started chasing me down into her mine/storage facilities with her sword drawn, so I fled (luckily the server restarting spared me).  I admit that in my flight I definitely did remove some blocks, but nothing more than stone from the cave walls to aid in my escape.  Eventually, however, she caught up to me and killed me (but did not pearl me).  Yes, and yes, in my view.

After being unable to reach her for a day or so, switch to a diamond sword, and run at me.  She attacked first, so I killed her with a pearl in my hotbar.  My plan was to bring her pearl to a secure vault in the nether and then discuss with her where my items were.  AFlatCap, a friend of Laurelai, offered to mediate and agreed to ascertain the location of my items from Laurelai while I held her pearl.  **Laurelai claims she has snitch logs of me griefing and stealing, but has not provided any evidence.**

However, I don't recall) started chasing after Laurelai's pearl.  He tracked it to the location of the vault but he fell into lava and died trying to enderpearl his way out.  tbeau1 then showed up, and in a panic, I struck him with a sword.  Neither of us did any serious damage and we came to the understanding that tbeau1 was only there to retrieve Matticus' items.  Fine.  I talked with Matticus in-game more about the situation and he seemed receptive to what was going on and towards a possible diplomatic solution.

Then Foofed, who was now searching for the alleged chest after getting coords from Laurelai) and Matticus (who had taken it upon himself to exact some kind of justice from me).  Foofed claimed that he only chose to intervene when he learned that I had attacked tbeau1, which doesn't really make sense to me given that I already apologized to tbeau1 (and I think, given the circumstances, it was not unreasonable for me to attack him).  Presumably Foofed and friends don't like it when other people encroach upon their monopoly on the use of force/pearling, because no one hired them to pursue me nor did they fully understand the context of my pearling of Laurelai.

Once I was pearled, Tutterise, etc. all left the area and Laurelai's friends broke her pearl out of my vault, leaving me trapped in the End alone.  AFlatCap subsequently told me that he and Laurelai could not locate the alleged chest with my items and that it was gone for good.  Laurelai continued to make threats that the ""Fempire"" would have me imprisoned indefinitely.

So, a set of iron armor, 31 diamonds (these things all taken by Laurelai), a set of Prot I diamond armor (minus the boots, which were not enchanted), a diamond sword with Knockback II Sharpness IV Looting II, one potion of splash damage, one iron pickaxe

**tl;dr I came across Laurelai's town, so I pearled her after she attacked me.  I was working towards a diplomatic solution via AFlatCap when Matticus_Rex, under the alias PrincessBelle07, started pursuing me in the nether.  We had a brief discussion and AFlatCap seemed to be making progress when I was pearled and my items taken from me by Foofed, Tutterise, and Exultant, who seem to have been acting under the auspices of some ""server justice.""  AFlatCap has told me that Laurelai said ""my items are gone"".  Laurelai got her friends to break her out of the End and she's now free while I'm stuck in the end.**

-----------------------------------------

Basically, iron armor, iron, diamond armor, diamond weapons, potions, and whatever else either Laurelai or Foofed/Tutterise/Exultant have taken from me and I want to be released from the End.  I would also like another 32 diamonds provided by any combination of Laurelai/Foofed/Tutterise/Exultant for the trouble, and nonsense this has caused and for time lost while in the End.

For the past ten months I have been staring at the server terminal during nearly every waking hour, to know any issues where handled. I have put more blood sweat and tears into the creation of this server than most of you will ever know

But I have my limits, avoid responding to even just one more comment. 

I poured everything I have into every single decision I made for Civcraft and the result was always the same. Criticism and outright hatred for my person for failing to make the 'right' decision. I thought if I could just have made a better choice, or if there was even a right door at all.

What do I do about the breaking of the vault? Its funny, too much difficulty that every single edge case is found and exploited before anyone even tries to use the game mechanic I designed so long ago. Minecraft is kludges all the way down, I am Mojang's Sisyphus, the minute one problem is solved another shows up and the load never lightens. Always a new way to break Citadel, always another way to defeat the game mechanic and thus the point of Civcraft. 

This is the part where you expect me to reach my conclusion, and then defend it here, of course you don't see the day I spend distracted and jumpy as I try and make counter arguments I am not sure of, or the habitual checking of my phone so that even while out I can not escape the consequences of whatever thing I decided is right. 

Well let me tell you somthing **I DONT FUCKING KNOW**

I decided to take a vacation, I knew I would probably come back to something more closely resembling a heap of slag than a server but I had hoped it would take more than one night. 

I present you with an ultimatum, I can make your impossible decisions and manage this server. But for that to happen there need to be a lot of changes around here. Do you know why I keep Exultant around? Because he is the only one who can get *anything* server related done without me, *he lets me go to sleep when something comes up the night before my chemistry final and I am about to snap*. I need more help, more competent help in running this server, I need to be able to go to sleep knowing a situation will be handled, that someone is watching the server terminal for the next crash, that I can if for only few hours not be responsible for *anything* and *everything*. I want a night where I can not jump awake at every sound from my phone worried that something has gone wrong with the server. Those are the conditions of my continued employment here. 

No one, because I came back. 

So here is your question, it only took a few days of Civcraft for me to understand that I would need to become one if I wanted to make this work. But I can not carry your burden alone any longer, it seems one can only play god for so long before he comes crashing back to earth. 

I leave the decision about Civcraft's fate up to you, hang out with friends, and live my life. 

I wanted to create a community about forming societies, I can't solve this problem but I can't go on with it being fixed. Its in your hands now, if you fail I guess there is always Rubicon. ",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1584zs/so_here_is_your_question/

I've been thinking for a couple of days now how best to write this post. I considered producing a final issue of the Pylon

I got a job... or more accurately, and now I'm following him. It was on his recommendation that I got this opportunity, and I'll be forever indebted to him. Or, you know, I'll just buy him a beer and call it even.

Unfortunately the nature of this job represents a partial conflict or interest with the management of a Minecraft server

Civcraft has been a [big part of my life for the past 7 months](http://i.imgur.com/gsmUZ.png). It was the first Minecraft server I've actively played. I was aware of online Minecraft before, I immediately fell in love with the sidebar. 

In my few months of playing and many months of managing, it's always been fun. The original content and the drama are like nothing I've ever experienced. My time here has been formative. I've truly learnt a lot and had a whole host of great times I'll recap in a minute...

I've made a lot of friends here, it turns out they're just other human beings with slightly different views to you. [You know who you are.](http://i.imgur.com/9zEe0.png)

This server is special and it *is* unique, with implemented law and imprisonment, with satirical newsletters from editors of high sexual prowess. It is, truly, an experience, and should be considered and remembered as such, even as some of you look onwards darkly. Think about how many other online games have made you feel like this... that's what's important about Civcraft. It's all the best parts of system design culminating in art.

There's way too many important names to list, remember; please don't feel bad if I miss you out, you know I don't mean it (unless I actualy mean it). People like egokick, exultant, erich, timmy, ride, erich, lightning, erich

The server in my mind is a string of incredible moments. From Columbia to Panama (literally), bitcoin drama, Columbiagate, and all'a'dat drama jazz. Every stupid meme that put a smile on my face. Every time a new player uses the phrase ""Admin Crimes"" to legitimately describe something the admins have done that he feels negatively about. And those moments in turn have shaped and cultivated a culture on this server that is like no others; a culture that is interesting even to outsiders who have no stake in the game.

#REALTALK time... I wouldn't have this opportunity if it weren't for Civcraft. I met Noxy through this server, even the ones I hate. You are all special little snowflakes, and this chapter of my life will feature prominantly in my future Wikipedia page (listed under **Mistakes -&gt; *Regrets***). 

I'll still be on the Mumble, although my posts will increase in value quite a bit, and I'm still involved in [SECRETS] [REDACTED] [THE THING YOU ALL AREN'T SUPPOSED TO KNOW ABOUT BUT OBVIOUSLY DO].

It's been a pleasure serving you, happiness, and of course as many admin crimes as your future admins can commit. C'est la vie. Allons-y. French goodbye shit.

Welcome to Civcraft, debate and discussion. Our backstory is based on history, not fiction. We’re forming a new direction for game-play, not just about surviving the elements, but about surviving each other, where players can work together to create and shape civilization or to watch it crumble. A world open to any idea, manifesto or philosophy, experimentation and community building.

I am ttk2 and the only thing you will see me doing is stopping cheaters and keeping the server online, society, is all left up to you. There are no rules about how you do things, anything goes and my word is far from law. I wish you the best of luck surviving and thriving in this world.

Our world, each block in Minecraft being one meter thick. When you join, you will spawn in a random location almost anywhere within the map. You may often spawn many kilometers from any other player, much less any sort of settlement. The in-game chat has a 1km limit, so any player more than a kilometer away will not hear your messages. This is done to prevent from being overwhelmed when we have more than 50 or so players online. [Mumble](http://www.mumble.com/mumble-download.php) is a voice and text chat program that is robust enough to handle as many simultaneous users as we care to throw at it without becoming a garbled mess. You can use mumble, the subreddit, or any other means to either find or promote locations to organize. If you are new to minecraft [this tutorial](http://www.minecraftwiki.net/wiki/Tutorials/Beginner's_guide) should be helpful.

In an attempt to make Minecraft better suited to our purposes we have created a couple of custom modifications and adapted others to our purposes.

**Citadel**

Citadel is our protection plugin, and chests from aggressors. It is built on the principle that protection requires resources, so to protect (or reinforce as it will be referred to) a block you must use any one of 3 resources: Clean Stone, Iron, or Diamond. Each one provides a certain level of protection. A stone protected block can be destroyed 25 times before it is actually removed from the game world. Iron is 250 times, and Diamond 1800.


* /ctfortify [security level]


/ctf acts as a shortened version of this command. Fortification is a toggle mode. When you type /ctf with no extra flags after it Citadel will detect the block in your hand and use it to reinforce blocks you place until you either run out of the reinforcement resource or run the /ctoff command to return to normal. As you place blocks the resource will be consumed from your inventory and about 10 seconds after you place them (to allow you to destroy misplaced blocks without undue effort) they will become reinforced with the material and permissions level you specify.


* /ctreinforce [security level]


/ctr acts as a shorthand version of this command. /ctr is a toggle command


* /ctallow


These are the group management commands. Each player has a list of individuals that make up their 'group'. Use the command * /ctallow &lt;playername&gt; to add a player to your list, meaning only you can interact with or remove the protected block. You can specify either public or group for any command that takes a security level (EX: /ctf public) public protections allow anyone to interact with them (open doors, or chests) but only the placer to destroy them. Group allows everyone on your list full control of the protected item, they can both interact with it and destroy it.


* /ctbypass


A toggle command. Once enabled


* /ctinfo



Another toggle

For details on Citadels groups feature please see [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/)

While Citadel's commands may be easy enough

**PrisonPearl**

See [the wiki](https://github.com/matthewbot/PrisonPearl/wiki)

PrisonPearl also has an Anti-alt account component, but if two or more of them are imprisoned no accounts other than the Pearled ones may connect. This system is automated and is sometimes prone to false positives, please use the message the moderators button the sidebar if you have an issue that you think is in error. 


**PreciousStones**


While this mod has many functions we are only using one, simply craft and place a jukebox. To use a snitch block, look at it and type /ps snitch to see its log. Keep in mind there is no log until someone other than the owner enters the field, so it may seem like the block is not working until someone triggers a log event.
While standing inside of your snitch block range type /ps allow [playername] to add a player to the field


**Physical Shop**


Place sign on wall above where chest will be. Keep in mind that you need to reinforce the sign as well as the chest with Citadel otherwise your items may be stolen.
Write on first line item name or number
On the second line
Our currency codes are
* g: Gold Ingot

Punch the sign to confirm it was set up properly.


Player may right-click the sign with applicable currency in-hand to buy from the shop.


Player may also right-click the sign with applicable item to sell to the shop.


**Mineralvein**


This is a passive plugin that changes the way resources are distributed in the game world. Instead of Minecraft's default even distribution of ores, but these are rare enough to be valuable in and of themselves.


**WorldBorder**


World border prevents players from leaving the 15000 block radius circle that makes up our game world. This limitation ensures that players simply do not generate more land and more resources. When in the nether,,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1349967209.0,,True

The Mods: Heavy Hitters:
------

Civcraft has five custom mods of primary importance to gameplay. 

* Citadel is our block protection plugin (see [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/kHJVX.jpg) for the basics). Citadel also allows players to have groups so that multiple players can access the same reinforcements. Citadel also allows you to create groups so that other players can access your reinforcements - read about this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/).

* PrisonPearl allows players to restrain other players (see [this infographic](http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg) for the basics). Keep in mind that every day you have a player pearled consumes 2 coal from the chest

* JukeAlert (see the [infographic](http://i.imgur.com/t9DaPOS.png) ) which lets players use jukeboxes to track and record the actions of other players in a small radius from the jukebox. JukeAlert is integrated with Citadel’s [group system](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/y1rkd/citadel_20_commands/)

* Factorymod is a complex tech tree with the goal of allowing more efficient production from resources.. It transfers of all XP generation over to crop growing. **You will not gain XP from killing mobs or mining normally**. [FactoryMod Wiki](https://github.com/gmlaxfanatic/FactoryMod/wiki) 

* RealisticBiomes is a mod to customize growth rates for various biomes to be more realistic as well as provide persistence in crop growth. [See the guide here.](https://github.com/Namrufus/RealisticBiomes/wiki/Usage)


---------

The Mods: Fine details:
----

Civcraft has a ton of more minor mods that handle various things. 

* [BottleO](http://i.imgur.com/ldQyZ.jpg) allows for convenient XP storage and transfer

* PhysicalShop allows for players to buy and sell items [see the guide here](http://pastebin.com/raw.php?i=YrpYkjMa)

* Civpets allows the untaming of animals for ownership transfer by feeding them cookies. 

* Dyncap lets us adjust the servers player cap on the fly for maximum player/performance ratio

* Arthropod Egg allows the use of a bane of arthropods enchanted weapon to occasionally cause mobs to drop corresponding spawn eggs. Higher level bane means higher chance of egg dropping. 

* MusterCull exists to limit the number of mobs for purposes of server performance. If you keep too many mobs in one spot (like a concentrated farm) MusterCull will target them for culling.

During a prolonged fight with two sizable groups, I don't know if it will be considered but it can't hurt)**, so I engaged him to see for myself. The way in which he hit me was unique when compared with others I was also fighting with at that time, and seems to be closer to an aimbot than the traditional ""force field"". In the first clip of the below video you can even see how he somehow hits me twice as I'm flying away, the second time as I am already airborne.

In minecraft a player's head is orientated to face the same direction that a player is looking. Since you use the small crosshairs in the center of your screen to target blocks or other players when striking, and how many times he hits me in succession. To the moderator who judges this claim (I'm looking at your orthzar), if you are not experienced in what normal minecraft pvp should look like, I would highly recommend seeking some outside opinions from more experienced players, or at least watching [videos like this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31RZ4bRu0Po&amp;feature=youtu.be), which show that even if players get turned around to face the wrong direction in combat they don't land hits on their opponent until they correct themselves.

Here is the video. I would highly recommend that anyone who watches the following video does so multiple times while reading this post

Here is [another video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPufZsFvkdg) of a player using the same client hacks, because it's hard to record both at the same time) of J Howard and some others (including ApatcheBlitz) talking with Josh about who J Howard has given his client to. He claims that he hasn't given it to Y_ankees, but then someone else mentions that someone could have shared it with Y_ankees, and is quickly shushed by others. J Howard even mentions that he's not going to mention any names about who he's given it to, as ""I told you I'm not telling...you're just going to go get them banned"", and ""if you're recording this mumble channel you've got evidence right there"".

Even if Y_ankees was not specifically using the jhoward client

* Not realize that its in the game



* Not want to spend the time to build factories.

But, or master engineer, or a professional combatant.  We obviously want to attract intelligent, strategic players, but we cannot exist without the unwashed masses.



A big goal of the factorymod is to keep players in a centralized loaction.  To help, which would be a weird but more successful grief than DRO.  So, either the factories dont have built-in reinforcements and we lose out on the centralized location ideas, or they do and we now have a big griefing problem.

FactoryMod inhibits this creativity by forming a (mostly) linear path that you MUST take to achieve items

Richard_T does not contest that he is responsible for breaking the dispenser (though Atrvmis actually made the final block break). While he does initially raise the question of his chances of finding the dispenser by accident

[Richard_T’s words in his defense](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16f9s8/evidence_and_accusations_against_richard_tand_alt/c7vilij): “The only reason I continued to mine was because I was told about there being a dispenser by another player.”

[This is followed shortly by a contradictory claim](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16f9s8/evidence_and_accusations_against_richard_tand_alt/c7vj8a7): “It was because I assumed that the chest he was trying to go to had far more people. We wanted all the people possible for future plans that will soon be announced. These stolen prisoners were to play a big part in future activities planned by my separate group of HCF members

Richard_T first claims that he was told about a dispenser (which the server logs show he was not. Midaas_ at one point says that he had a friend in the vault, he [makes a third contradictory claim](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/16f9s8/evidence_and_accusations_against_richard_tand_alt/c7vry2s): “I did not mine the vault in order to free this guys friend, but for the chance that there would be more loot undiscovered loot. I took over the mining to insure that we got any other loot and not him.”

The fact that his story is inconsistent is not in itself fatal to his case

Richard_T claims that he knew to mine around to look for it, one would think that he would mine in that direction, or mine further from Midaas_’s shaft down to where one could imagine Midaas_ would be mining to.

Richard_T’s first two block breaks seem to fit this narrative: he mines two blocks South from his own mine shaft, breaks down here. Richard_T claims to have changed his mind here, and changes direction, going back to his starting point and mining West (*further* from Midaas_ mining spot). This simply does not make sense given his story.

In order to more clearly demonstrate Richard_T’s narrative

To corroborate the charge of cheating, it does demonstrate that he had the capability to use x-ray and gives additional credence to such claims. ([See Precedent](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/13wqbd/evidence_of_summoner_cheating/c77uoyy)) Further, [Yakman stated](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1591dx/the_story_and_legality_of_breaking_the_vault/) that Richard_T had been involved in the World Downloader incident at the same vault (which is conveniently admitted by Richard_T in the same thread). While this also does not prove that he used that information here or that he used the same technique again, it does demonstrate consistency with exhibited character traits.

The vault in question is made up of over 4000 diamond-reinforced obsidian. There was a single hidden dispenser surrounded by bedrock on all sides but one. Richard_T’s defense would support continued mining to the South, the evidence is clear and convincing.

There was 20 people online at the time why did he simply not message me ingame? he knew I lived here? why did he not come into mumble and ask me?

The answer is obvious because of his last statement where he says

""They were pearled in response to the attack on myself


It is obvious to me that he had a grudge against me and had full intention of simply violating my land to cause a fight so he could try to justify the pearling of us.

I have to laugh at "" wilful intent to harm the integrity of the server"" when I've spent the last 6 months quietly building a town pretty much on my own until recently at which point I have had numerous people join me bananafone31 for one who's primary reason was to escape the harassment of people it seems your consider to be friends.

So NJ if anyone is trying to harm the integrity of the server it is people like you who have no respect for other people and how they wish to spend there time in this game. Shown by your disregard of my land and it's residents.

Firstly

The vault is approximately 18x18 in surface area

The following is evidence that Y_ankees and Ryko1412 were involved in digging **directly** down to one of this dispensers.   

* Location to the dispenser

* Evidence of breaking blocks directly above said broken dispensers:

 * http://i.imgur.com/00L2B.png

I think it is extremely clear given the evidence that these two players used X-ray to aid them in the raiding of my vault? Why?

1. They dug *straight* down on to the first dispenser they broke.

2. With a surface are of ~324 blocks

3. I see no plausible explanation outside of the use of x-ray or x-ray-like mods or tools that could explain this situation. Circumstantially

4. The dispenser was not in the center of the vault, but instead of mining into the center, the accused mined directly down on top of the dispenser, which was not in the center. Only more evidence to suggest they had foreknowledge of the location of the dispensers before they started mining, gained through the use of xray.

After finding it on the main server I started tinkering on the Testing server, no extraneous region files generated at all. What was the difference then? Lots of players, so I pointed the Civtest port to the regular Civcraft port in hopes of getting the join spam and there it was again, extraneous region files being generated rapidly. I tried removing NCP and the generation stopped again, I added NCP and pointed Civtest back at 25566 and there it was, a few people joined but no extraneous region files were generated. 

It seemed that the only way to reproduce this but was to have nocheat+spigot and very very rapid joining of a server. I tried it with bukkit, once again Nocheat + Joinspam = extra region files. 

The only conclusion is that this bug exists for every server running 1.5.2 Bukkit and NoCheatPlus (most of them) but it is entirely dependent on very fast join times. What has been happening to Civcraft over the past couple of days? Possibly the most join spammed server on the planet right now

This is utterly ridiculous, I would be laughed out of #Spigot, so I just kept on trying it, and again and again it was reproduced perfectly. I may be missing somthing, I may not be quite entirely right. But I am sure of one thing, I am not in Kansas anymore. 

My primary suggestion for devlopers is to look through [NCP](https://github.com/NoCheatPlus/NoCheatPlus) probably the fast join check it has

In the meantime I am bringing the backup back on over to the primary machine and Civcraft should be ready to go back online soon

How are the alternatives to NoCheatPlus these days? 

I may need to call upon you guys once again to try to join a testing server to test this bug

1367337183.0,1df0lt,My ideas on Civcraft 2.0,valadian,112,24,307,"Wanted to bring the ideas of ttk2 and some of the other great ones I have heard along with several of my own ideas

This will be A LOT of text

**Size:**

This is still being debated, I prefer a larger world. If we want scarcity, control that by ore distribution. If you want player density and conflict... make people want to live close to each other though mechanics. without nether... living near a city is the only way for trade.

Why larger? I would love to have a **60k radius world** ... I want to hear of a group of raiders terrorizing a certain region... wanting to be involved

EDIT: **30k** would still have the same idea

EDIT: Wildweasel's idea. Scaling world border. Every month the world border expands 1 or 2k. The world starts small, new frontiers are revealed and conqured, along with the resources within them. This idea also kills world border vaults as any more than temporary deals, would also allow a square world border (less server load) without the sillyness of corner vaults.




EDIT: I remember the other problem with worldborder. Disk space/backup times. Would have to balance this with admin team.

Travel would be a BIG DEAL. Couriers... traveling tradesmen. A large map encourages each region to generate **UNIQUE CULTURE**. Every region will need local providers/tradesmen for goods, to dangerous to travel, others, quiet and pristine. It should be impossible for 2 people plus a few helpers to build the entire world's roads.

**Biomes:**

There should also be **Large Biomes**. This combined with other things I will discuss, etc.. will make biome location actually matter, and will encourage economic and culture distinctions between regions. This is already being done with the mod **TerrainControl**. I also think there should be **no painted contour maps**. They are boring and lose the ""minecraft feel"". It just makes rolling hills everywhere.

**Nether:**

So, where are the resources? Go explore your big world. There are dangerous **hell biomes**, that contain the resources you so crave. You will find ghasts... nether fortresses... glowstone, and lava there.

EDIT:
Another idea

**1:1 nether, but eliminates some of the lag/ugly issues of hell biomes.

**Ore Distribution:**

I think most people are agreeing on how this should be done. Reduced vanilla distribution EVERYWHERE. I have heard the number 1/6th thrown around... sounds good to me. **1/6 vanilla distribution**. On average this means 1 diamond ore per 2 chunks.

Now, and are suddenly set for the rest of their server career because they found a single vein. This also has a poor effect of benefiting those that are willing to go to less than legal ways of finding veins. My proposal: small veins only. Diamonds will be rare, and one or two hundred diamonds will be a massive haul in comparison. **smaller, more common veins** should make long term prospecting worth while, without making it a big lottery system. Mineral Vein also has the ability to **restrict veins to appearing in certain biomes**... This could add more intelligent ""prospecting"", where you search for a suitable place, and then prospect it hoping for veins of the desired type. **No natural reinforcement**. It is not fun

EDIT: Vein ideas. See Wildweazels post:

&gt; I think this overlayed with reduced vanilla ores is the best solution. I imagine something like 1/6-1/4 ores over the whole map

&gt; - Relatively realistic
&gt; - Veins aren't obvious
&gt; - One person can't possibly clear a vein in a reasonable time
&gt; - Finding a vein is not an instant win
&gt; - Regions with concentrations of ore are more valuable over a longer term
&gt; - Players must project ownership claims over a large area to secure veins
&gt; - Mining a vein region is roughly equivalent to vanilla mining

**Factory Mod:**

We have all played with this. It is rough? challenging? Yeah, we are already limiting advancement with scarcity. **Technology (Factory Mod) is a way of mitigating scarcity**. Basic machines are slightly more efficient. Maybe 10-20%. You can make 10 swords for the cost of 8. Advanced machines become much more so, but with an upkeep cost. Maybe something like... 40% more efficient, but you need to make 20 of them in a month to break even. Those equipping and feeding armies will certainly go the route of advanced factories. Working together and pooling resources has a distinct advantage.

One possible idea is: **restrict diamond gear to Factory only**. Only those willing to invest in static factories will be able to reach the pinnacle of technology. This would impact getting basically established on the server. Looking forward to the debate on this one.

**Enchanting:**

FactoryMod also has enchanting. I would love to eliminate XP grinding... but I am not sure that NPC drop grinding (for factory mod) is necessarily the answer. **One possible solution is banning alting and bots?** I am still concerned that this forces a more heavily moderated environment then we prefer. There are other ways of changing the mechanic. Making mobs take damage when their numbers exceed X per chunk would massively **nerf drop/crush grinders and dark rooms** without impacting vanilla spawning as much. Ideally.. XP would primarily come from manually killing mobs, and encourage people to work together. 

The last idea that occurs to me is making tools/armor that is made from **advanced factories naturally enchanted** occasionally. I think this may be one of the best ideas. Mass production of gear would have a percentage be enchanted

EDIT: Optional way of handling XP. Have nothing drop XP. Makes xp grinders nonexistent. Instead

**Potions:**

 I think potions as it is... ok. It is deterministic

**Realistic Biomes:**

I would really like to see this refined and put in place. Perhaps not quite as much as the starving simulator that we had in place, easy to grow place where **food is plentiful, but ore is rare?**, or do you pack a sack of food to a dangerous place to pillage its riches...Property implemented this should encourage factories to feed large populations.

**iron and gold farms:**

To be honest, I don't think they can be balanced with scarcity. **Make iron and gold a nonrenewable resource.**. Remove iron ingot drops from zombies and iron golems (keep the hats/swords/etc). Remove gold nugget drops from zombie pigmen.

I think that is all that I can think of.. I will edit in more as I think of it.

EDIT:

I think chat range should be reduced to 400-500. This will encourage cities to be built next to each other (and still have personal chat space). Without nether

EDIT: **Citadel changes:**

Make reinforced blocks unflammable. Why should wood/wool be such a terrible building material choice over stone? It is just as easy to get,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1367356204.0,,CivcraftDev,t3_1df0lt

1.  XP grinding is boring and gives a large advantage to botters
2.  Farming is only difficult at the begining of the game

3.  Update enchanting to 1.3 mechanics as outlined in [this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1da63i/concerning_enchanting/).

##Civcraft is in an interesting position right now.  I feel that in a few months


##With so many conflicting views and ideas concerning the current state of Civcraft, keep in mind that I am focusing on the general population rather than specific individuals.


**I will be summarizing the events that have taken place from the HCF invasion until now, go ahead and skip down to ""This brings us to today""**


**Alright


The HCF first appeared to be a welcome member of society.  They presented a new challenge to the factions that had held power for most (if not all) of the time Civcraft had existed.  The HCF arrived claiming to want to destroy the ancaps.  The HCF successfully took out many of the ancaps' primary players, with an estimated 50 pearlings.  Civcraft was devastated.  Concentration camps were opened up (Wutang Resort by MrTwiggy being the most famous) and server morale continued to drop as the pearled number increased.  During this time the first question you asked someone was: ""Are you HCF?""  They had complete and utter control over the server.  


The sad truth is we overestimated them.  The citizens of civcraft combined had so many more rescources.  Also, pearling anyone in their way.  Even after all the cities they had destroyed and all the players they had pearled, we believed them when many claimed ""We are not all one group,"" and ""we want to be a part of our own society.""  They let it seem as if we were ok to go back to the way things were, and immediately crushed us again.


As January rolled by things slowly began to calm down.  Many of the high-profile HCF (Spurion, etc.) had left already, leaving vaults full of prisoners.  The server limped on for the rest of January and the beginning of February, still for the most part in hiding from hot-head HCF players like y_ankees and mcfluffykins that still pearled for the most part without discretion.  Then, y_ankees was banned.  Many Civraftians naively rejoiced, celebrating ""The end of the war.""  many veteran players argued (correctly) that we could not celebrate yet, as this was just one player and they would most likely retaliate for the banning.  Another strong wave of HCF attacks came after y_ankees was banned, the HCF began to crumble.  Also


The official end of the war came near the end of February, and remaining HCF either reformed or were hunted down.  


**This bring us to the last month or so


Things were very peaceful for a couple weeks.  New cities, Fellowship, NCO, Sørenstein, Trotskygrad, Elephantine, Arx Republicus, Montagna, however many argue that this was a good thing.


Then, and killed.  The fact that they were clearly alts of current civcraft players, and that they did not pearl anyone, gave insight into their intentions.  


* Because they were not pearling


* Alt accounts based on civcraft jokes told us two things.  These players were obviously involved civcraft players.  Also


All these points were made by numerous people, and arguably on its way to being a ""World Power"".  Suddenly the world of Civcraft was scrambling to determine who its friends and foes really were.  Was that bounty hunter they had given group permissions to actually griefing their city behind their back?  Or maybe he wasn't a bounty hunter at all, and was helping another city prepare for a conquest!


With the server divided yet again


Many don't realize the importance of this second attack.  Many don't even know exactly what happened that day.  This is because the HCF were quickly stopped.  A few powerful players were pearled, or patrolling the nether roads.  The vault was cracked in roughly 12 hours.  No HCF dared to fight back.  Perhaps one of the greatest days in civcraft history had transpired without much ceremony.  Why is this so significant?  


Civcraft,"" the HCF had not really been beaten, they just petered out.  This time, they were completely blocked.  They were present on the server for maybe 24 hours total.  


With this great victory,"" as it began to be called, continued to grief, steal, and kill.  Even with the large bounties placed on them (which would normally attract the always bounty hunting World Police) they ran around freely, doing as they pleased.


The LSIF eventually stepped in (see [woundedgod's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1a6q6o/out_bleeding_madras_for_being/)) with their alt list compiled from the LSIF-run server CivPvP.  With 008Shock and (later) Bleeding_Madras exposed as being behind two of the Gimmick Brigade accounts





**This brings us to today.**

**With the impending storm of drama that will most likely result from the LSIF releasing the Gimmick Brigade alt list

**First Point:** ***The Absence of Powerful States***

A sad truth in these times is that there is no conventional state that holds true power.  One argue the LSIF, but for our purposes in discussing state power, they remain obsolete.  


Aristopolis is a good example.  Although joked about, Aristopolis, like so many other cities, holds no true power on the server.


Danzig is another good example.  Fairly secluded, they hold a lot of influence in Civcraft.  However they lack the support a large population that would be willing to support the state through either military operations or economic plans, thus losing a good chance at world power.  


So who does hold the power on Civcraft?  Well, but have only a small obligation to actually work for, defend, and stay in these cities.  While these players (consisting of various factions like World Police, Josh and Friends, and ex-Danzilonians) hold a fair amount of power, they have no real connection to a state.  Sure, but these cities only really act as locations


**tl;dr #1:**     


**At the moment

**Second Point:** ***Capitalism vs. Socialism***


This is an always-going battle on Civcraft.  We may never know which is the better system.  This is actually a real-life conflict that CivCraft simulates well.  I've boiled this down to a pretty simple question:


What is your goal on CivCraft?


* If you answered to create a strong city


* If you answered to become rich


*But wait... this is obvious right?*


Yes, you most likely will not be very wealthy (personally) but will be completely supported by your state, and thus be connected and devoted to it.  On the other hand, capitalism will allow you to become a wealthy individual, but not be truly connected to any group of players.  


I have personally experienced both sides.  I began as a socialist in Buenos Aires.  I really enjoyed the community and the connection to the state.  I had a sense of pride for my country.  However, however I miss the sense connection to the other players and your home.  In Civcraft, it all depends on how you want to play.  


My opinion is that if a group of wealthy players (derived from capitalism) came together and formed a socialist state, with new players entering consistantly. With a strong quota system, it could very well become a world power.  The citizens would be devoted to their city, and at the same time be profiting personally.  

*Socialism and Capitalism together?* Not possible.


I dare someone to try.


**tl;dr #2:** 


**I actually would like to see these coexist.  Using capitalism to gain wealth


.


.


.



**Third (and last/most important) Point:**  ***Who will fill the power vacuum in the next era of CivCraft?***


This is the question we all have been asking since the end of the war.  No state is currently powerful enough to step up.  Individual players (World Police


I know you won't like to hear this, wealthy, good fighters, intelligent, and loyal to one another.  They struck hard against thier opponents without fear of the repercussions.  



So who will be the next 'HCF'?  Don't get me wrong

1370225414.0,1fk02u,I play civcraft and I cheat and never been caught. Now I tell you what cheaters don't want you to know.,TonyaHardingsPussy,108,30,139,"First off

I first started playing minecraft with just a couple friends and none of us ever heard of or considered using exploits in the game.  Eventually our small server grew a bit bigger and after posting on reddit, we discovered that somebody was just giving away diamonds rather liberally and discovered they were using an xray mod to harvest them.  We didn't know the difference between the texture pack and mods until then.  This increased over time and we needed more moderators to police the server which was hard to do.  Later on, somebody discovered how to dupe items and this apparently went on for a while before somebody noticed when the spawn was covered with stacks upon stacks of them.  Naturally, I felt that all my time getting the assets I had were pretty much worthless and I grew disinterest and quit playing there.  I got bored and found other servers that the dupe glitches worked on and decided to have a little fun.  I found xray mods and found it fun to sneak in and loot hidden chests buried everywhere and listen to the commotion.   Eventually that got boring and I looked into other exploits to get my rocks off.  I found stuff like Zombe that lets you fly all around and before these nocheat mods, you could pretty much get away with it unless an admin or someone saw you and snitched you out.  The mods grew more robust that let people protect their work such as protecting blocks and doors.  I found mods that allowed you to freecam around and loot chests in these protected areas if you couldn't break blocks and people could never figure out who did it.  It was awesome.  Me and a small group of friends would go around raiding servers just for fun and we pretty much lost any will to play the game how it was supposed to be because so many people had the same tools and cheated in the same way.  This grew to PvP style servers where we learned different tricks to pretty much guarantee winning a battle with the most hilarious being freelook cheats hitting and killing someone from 40 blocks away and being invisible.  Things like this were eventually patched and other ways were found to cheat.  One day I was jerking around when somebody caught me and accused me of using ""Nodus"".  I was like wtf is that, don't play stupid etc. etc.  so I looked it up and found the nodus client which was actually pretty sweet with many new tools I never dreamed of before.  I actually liked minecraft and wanted to play a legit game so I would often ""test"" servers with nodus to see how easy it was to cheat and if you could, I'd either grief them and leave


Then one day, you could do pretty much anything other than PVP style exploits of which was a sizable challenge from griefing whiny 13 year old's DSL line servers.  Also, you couldn't possibly get banned unless someone had irrefutable proof so it wasn't like these servers run by 13 year old boys who ban you because they ""suspect"" you're cheating without proof.  The group of us got together and built a modest empire and of course the whole getting attacked/attacking/getting pearled/breaking pearls out thing happened so we had the need to put things more in our favor and Nodus simply didn't cut it.  One of us was fairly good at coding so we started to get ideas for making our own client that was specific to things we needed to do in civcraft.  Some of the features we implemented were, Xray (of course).  PVP enhancements which were a bit like autolook and forcefield built in together from the nodus client, and tweaks to do speedhacks for short bursts without detection.  This involved things like going at 0.00 speed for a short time then 3.00 or more speed for a short time.  This gave a huge advantage of making it look like we stopped chasing our enemy only to make them stop for a moment at close radius, say less than 20 blocks, then run really fast towards them to do an unexpected attack.  There's several others that involve being able to stand still with nopacketTX and not take damage at close range (or give it) during critical moments.  Other things in our client include vaultbreaker which combines automine, you can set the client to perform a task such as beep, a white box is painted with their name in orange so you can easily build a vault around them if you wish.  Also, if you put your vaults in a single layer of IRO or DRO

1367199310.0,1db4cu,Culture: The massive ingredient CivCraft 1.0 lacked.,Jayrate,93,10,151,"CivCraft is an attempt to simulate the rise and fall of real-world civilizations, and admin non-intervention in order to further refine the virtual environment to better approximate reality, and large-scale economics has been demonstrated.

-

For the most part, like death and reproduction, have proven difficult to apply, but for the most part, anything that can be simulated has been simulated, at least mildly. One civilization-creating force has been largely ignored in CivCraft: Culture.

-

Culture (encompassing architecture, and random day-to-day practices) has had a massive impact on human civilization. Most of the nations of the world are united not as a political unit, but as a cultural one. What ties Frenchmen together is not the government seated in Paris, but the common ancestry, the common language, the common business practices, the common *culture* of France. Empires have been built on common culture as much as they have collapsed due to opposing internal cultures. Even economics is heavily affected by culture, despite the obvious massive impact on human organizations

-

Implementing something as complex as culture into Minecraft is no simple task. Certain facets of culture simply cannot be reasonably tested, and tow thousands of items along with, making localized resources barely relevant. Even on the ""large biomes"" setting, any resource is only a few minutes away.

-

So what can we do?

1) Make travel difficult. People naturally align themselves with those they identify with. When travel is difficult, a crucial component of culture. This can be accomplished by removing the Nether (Which sounds to be almost guaranteed in CivCraft 2.0) and creating rough terrain with bedrock foundations, as seen in recent CivTests. This will prevent straight-shot roads that, on Swiftness II potions, act like bullet trains. It's difficult to rapidly scale a tall, steep mountain on foot, and also saps food, but will require very significant investment to create and protect.

2) Create an incentive to use local materials instead of importing foreign goods. When certain resources are simply unavailable, as roughly demonstrated in this broad map-type proposal [here](http://i.imgur.com/vgUBm3o.png), where different colors represent different biomes. Terrain height and subterranean composition will still vary throughout the world without regard to biome, as will water supplies. Essentially, biomes are large enough to be one or two of a kind, and span massive swaths of land. In order to obtain sand, a player might have to trek across the wilderness or import with a high expense for distance traveled. Melons might be rare in one area but plentiful in a region where they can be grown. Wood types, another might be largely birch and sandstone

3) Nerf players' carrying capacity. This ties in to #2 in helping to limit the widespread flow of foreign products. High-value, carrying enough blocks to craft a good-sized house is a simple feat, and transporting massive quantities of goods is really not too much of a difficulty. Reducing stack size or inventory size, or causing a player to slow down when carrying too much could help greatly in creating travel costs, giving an advantage to local, plentiful materials. Firms might compete locally for sales in ""closed-circuit"" region-wide economies instead of competing on a global market, giving a huge depth to server economics. Also, very cheap expense.

-

While CivCraft can certainly manage without it, which I think we all strive to do. Limiting transportation of both players and resources is just the first step in developing region-specific cultures. Like-minded players would want to live in cities whose architecture and traditions they enjoy, making actual communities based on factors other than political ideology or economic philosophy.

Civcraft is an irradiated wasteland. Within it lie cities. Outside the world border, nether highways, mega-cities.  Convulsing, choking, breaking under their own weight. Citizens in fear of the x-ray, the aimbot, the forcefield. Only one thing fighting for order in the chaos: The men and women of the admin team. Juries... Executioners... Judges.

Dramatic? Yes

I am the law. I am Chief Justice Dredd

**The Question**

Due process in a video game?  Justice in the meatspace is a hard enough proposition. What would possess a group to attempt to apply that principle

Or maybe the larger question - why make Civcraft at all? Why invest so much time and so much effort into something when it is not even up to you if it turns into an incredible utopia or a heaping pile of miserable slag?  Would not the sure investment be better? Time spent creating maybe a game as a work of art as opposed to a game as an experiment

*Why?*                                                        

Because the idea is to make a game that not only truly respected its players intelligence, and existed in a class of its own as a game with goals so much larger and more complex than simply being appreciated as a work of art. The goal is, in a way, to pay tribute to the awe-inspiring complexity and ability of the human mind and the universe in which it resides by pulling it into perspective - by *placing the universe in a box* and playing a *game* with it.

That said, but the worst that happens here is that you have to go play on another server. If we continued to try to implement such a stringent standard of proof here, most cheaters would go unpunished.

This presents a serious problem.  Most games deal with this by adopting a “ban first, in order to succeed, we must strike a careful balance between shotgun banhammering and total non-enforcement. To maintain the integrity of the gameplay experience, *we are going to have to ban more people than we have in the past*. Some people are not going to be happy. That’s unfortunate, but if you don’t like it, code us a new game.

Changes will have to be made.

**The Process**

Cheating inquiries are going to be significantly more private than they have been. This is not the People’s Court. You’ve never played a game with transparent moderation before, and makes the Judge’s job easier. Much of the proceeding, however, will take place in messages between the Judge, the defendant, and the accusers. This is necessary in order to get more detailed information. Judges are also encouraged to make other inquiries and gather additional material on their own.

The purpose of cheating inquiries is *not* the procedure itself. This is not a venue in which someone’s failure to get a warrant will get you out of jail even though everyone knows you’re guilty. The point is to find truth, and some things may change on the fly as needed.

We want this to be fair. We never want to ban someone who wasn’t cheating. The simple reality is, we very well may get a legit player or two in there as well. “Statistical impossibility” is far too high a burden of proof. If a few decent players end up playing on a different server in order that we may get rid of those actually x-raying, etc., then that’s how it must be. I’ll note here that this is only okay because the server is not public property, and the consequences of a ban are not actually damaging. We can get away with a lot more than a real world justice system, because we’re not talking about matters of life and death.

**The Standard of Proof**

The new standard of proof is more-or-less “[by clear and convincing evidence]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legal_burden_of_proof#Clear_and_convincing_evidence).” This strikes as close a balance as I think we can get between chaos (*anarchy!*) and administrative authoritarianism that would run counter to the ethos of Civcraft. While this may seem like a shift (and compared to a few decisions by Orthzar, refer to the forthcoming case decisions (probably today or tomorrow).

As for evidenciary standards, though it will merely be used for corroboration and will be subject to inquiry. Evidence of hacking (or alts) on other servers may also be used as corroborating evidence. As in the meatspace, the Judge will determine what is admissible.


**Reserved rights**

We reserve the right to change process at any time. What we will *not* do

We reserve the right to go back and look at previous cases. This will not be common, not process, is the goal. Process is just how we get there.

If you are a rude prick to the Judge or administrators during your inquiry

We reserve the right to hear any appeals that may be put forth

We reserve the right to keep from the general public evidence of certain methods of hacking or cheating that we do not wish to become public. The person banned will know why they were banned

We reserve the right to answer your question with a simple “no.”

**Conclusion**

We continue to hope that we can provide the best gaming experience you’ve ever had. We have something truly unique here – truly beautiful. People get emotionally involved in Civcraft in a way that rivals or exceeds what happens in other MMOs that have massive budgets, I hope, demonstrate that we are serious about eliminating as much cheating as possible from Civcraft. We want a level playing field.

The cheating policy in the sidebar will be undergoing some changes in the next few days as well to reflect what is written in this post.

Let me explain the sociopolitical situation on the server before your arrival. 

The vast majority of wealth and power was in the hands of the CKC (those you falsely call the 'ancaps' who are, however). This, in turn, meant that they were the most well-equipped, most organised and most powerful group on the server. They had a monopoly on force, as they were able to defend their property using their superior PVP skills and armour violently in a way that ensured any disagreements with that definition of property were disregarded. At the end of the day, my own disagreement with the right-wing conception of private property was irrelevant, I would be pearled as I am not adequately skilled or equipped to reinforce my actions. My political disagreements with the CKC are well-known. Your analysis of the server up to this point was correct

However, yes, but not to the point of immovable hegemony because at the end of the day they never had a monopoly on **all the server's resources**. 

Your 'ancaps' may have been the richest and most actively powerful players on the server, like you. For all their shortcomings, they played the game as it was meant to be played.

Your first point of attack was, due to the ill-informed belief that it was the ancaps' favourite city. Mt. Augusta has always been a great place for new players to start, and as far as I'm aware, actual 'ancaps' have never even lived there in numbers larger than 1 or 2. You have attacked and pearled players relentlessly from every single different group in the server. You have remorselessly destroyed the cities and settlements that aren't in any way associated with a belief in capitalism or anarchism. Your justification for your bloodlust is nothing but a mere smokescreen, aiming to build on the fears and common grievances of the servers' population. I can't even walk through the nether roads anymore without being attacked. The way you pearl players is uncoordinated, unbiased and completely arbitrary. The fact is you don't care about what group we belong to, you don't care what city you're in and you don't care about ending the old regime. You only care about ruining a great game for hundreds of people. 

So as the CKC wither away, you, the HCF, will emerge the victors of a vacuous war on community, on socialisation, and on time and effort. Amidst the smoke and the ashes, you will stand alone; your tin crown will gleam in the half-light of the setting sun, with no cities left to burn. The sun will fall over the crest of the horizon before you press the log-out button, will be no more. Enjoy your victory. ",t5_2tm1t

when i founded it with shortman back in october (october 20, to be home to growth and factories and all sorts of goodness, open to only the best of people. and it was great, we picked up some good people such as mateyHD, lat3nt, spanone and others. it was to be that until around december when eagles started to focus on the HCF fight, leaving me to look after the city while he was out *fighting the good fight*. the settlement almost died from sheer neglect at the time as it was basically just me building on the superfortress the entire time (i wanted no part in the war). towards the second half of the war things started coming back to the works but not in the good way. basically people started to come here because the works had become a place for supply storage almost had a vault for the war. little more than what used to be a pretty town and a war base. after the war i took a week long hiatus and after a day of being back an entirely new district had been started with all new citizens (unprecedented as before we had thoroughly discussed any new builds or new members, and because they didnt neither did eagles. sure, to them it was just another property they could own). they ended up using their property as storage

anyways, i lost any respect there when shitheads (sorry not sorry) moved in, and i dont agree with what actions it and its most active citizens make (whats left of them). it never became what it was meant to be, now its just half built houses, burned down wooden ones, and empty plots. im sure you must have noticed my departure was imminent by now as ive torn down most of what ive built: the cathedral, the dhingus and co lofts, much of the superfortress

Why discourage people from trying to make their city just because you dont consider it one of the legitimate cities

My warning is...

- Don't just assume the world powers are set because certain members of those cities say so. 
- Don't attempt to work out which cities are legitimate and will be world powers on reddit before the map is even up. 
- Let the experiment take place in game on the server
- Remember that all the world powers on the last server started somewhere and whatever city you lived in was once just an idea in the head of someone just like the people you are now discouraging. (edited in because i though of it later)

*Foreword - Yes my post is almost a direct contradiction to the content

HCF is here to ruin everyone's fun.  Don't look any further into the motives -- it's simply what these kind of communities do to entertain themselves.  I used to play on a ""hardcore"" PVP server that would raid other, log out when you see an unknown entity on your radar.  If you do get pearled, don't come onto the subreddit to post a long rant about how these children must be 13 and have no lives or whatever because that's just making your situation worse as it entrenches their ""ideology.""  I'm sure they're getting their jollies with the incredible response on the subreddit from their actions.


Hell, and they especially don't care about experimenting with evaluating the benefits of various governance styles and economies.  In fact, *if they can hurt your feelings by altering a few bytes on a server somewhere, then you are giving them far more power than they already have.  This is why they are flooding this server - the nature of the experiment invites huge amounts of drama and strained emotions as this is more than just a video game for many of the regular players.*  It's basically a candy store for anyone who wants to get off on griefing - you can essentially permaban anyone by winning at PVP.  It's like logging onto a creative server that has no block protection or whitelist.


I've been here from the very first week of the server, I'll just go play my guitar or something instead of validating their entire motivations to create chaos.  I've already gotten an incredibly rich, fulfilling experience from this server and its wonderful history.


Perhaps use this experience to evaluate morality

To the mods: FUCK YOU. Y_Ankees was CLEARLY using x-ray. He even said

To TTK: FUCK YOU TOO. Sure, which will work for a week and then HCF will come shit on everything up there. If you don't exercise your rights as owner of this server and ban these HCF fuckers, you will lose this server. People will leave. Maybe that's the best thing for you.

While that is not great it is an appreciable improvement considering that simply loading a backup would have brought us back 5 hours and then this whole thing would have happened again next time someone encountered one of the 4 broken chunks. 

Anyways, so our best ETA was about 5 hours. We downloaded the map to a machine with more threads, which got the job done in 1 hour thanks to the wonders of multithreading, but it does not have that great of an upload speed to send the fixed data back to Achilles.  At the end of the day it will probably end up being a wash as to which method would have been faster. 

But the fact remains that while the upload should be done in a few hours at most its going to be pretty close to [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1erhrk/scheduled_maintenance_on_our_vm_host_in_about_18/)

It is also nice how you can coexist with non-alliance-members peacefully, that the person you are talking to has spent 10 months of CivCraft 1.0 as a Diplomat. You weren't even here back then, you cunt! You are calling me close minded, and are implying you had the power to influence my people against me.

YOU. KNOW. NOTHING.

You know nothing about how the server works, no. I wrote a decent part of that treaty. Just shut up.

Who are you again? Why did nobody know about you until about a month ago? You know me better than I do? Are you my psych doc? Oh hi Dr. Meienburg

also

It took your misspelling about thirty seconds to become a meme on the Prussian sub.

&gt;I'm not one for stupidities. You're the idiot in the room.

Did you ever re-read your post history? It is a /r/CivCringe gold mine! You are a fucking moron

Made my day. Do you even know who I am? What I did? How Prussia was created? Why we are like we are? How we even are? Obviously not.

And the absolute gem:

&gt;Consider yourself closed off to Tridentia

So

We know this recording was done after the attacks on BSK because I made a reddit post over a month ago showing when fluffy first contacted me.

1) Black Stone Keep had been under attack for a week + at this point

2) Fluffy contacted me regarding BSK being under attack as he was aware or thought he knew who those players were.

3) My conversation with fluffy we even speak about him returning as a legitimate player.

4) When you hear me speak about ""Ancaps/WP"" it refers to the group Gimmick Brigade



Enjoy ;)

This is being published by me because as I have said all along I have nothing to hide. I'm happy to discuss anything in this recording

I'll tell you...Nothing. They didn't want this published because they knew it would not stand up as evidence against me.

Edit: I'm in BSK mumble if anyone has any questions ;)

To clarify some things as after talking to some people I'm aware how this may shed a bad light on LSIF in general

So when I speak about LSIF I mainly refer to StriaghtFoolish and what we had discussed

1354073627.0,13wxdf,Codification of cheating policy. ,ttk2,78,9,52,"**A Disclaimer**:
---
This server operates on a common law precedent based legal system to resolve disputes with administrators about in game legality of actions. The goal of this post is to summarize the precedent set by various cases as well as possible

----
**Actions defined as cheating**:
--

1. The use of any client side modification to the Minecraft client that changes the data being *sent to* the server from the behavior of the standard client. 

1. The use of a client side modification to gain and act on more information about the server map than possible with the default client. 


---

Players found to be cheating using evidence from the server terminal may appeal their ban with a subreddit post or modmail message.

Players who have evidence of another player is cheating according to the definition above must report such incidents to modmail with accompanying evidence and case support. If the accuser desires they can make their accusation public by making a thread and messaging modmail on the issue. 

----

**Notes on other client modifications**
--

Modifications such as player radar, texture packs, etcetera do not modify the data the client sends to the server and thus do not fall under the definition of cheating as outlined above. Ideally it would be possible to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the use of mods enhancing the display of data sent to the client for things other than the occasionally obvious use of x-ray. Since this is sadly not the case we have chosen to not ban for controversial mods such as player radar on the premise that it is better to do nothing at all than act on shaky evidence. 

--- 

**Case law and precedent** 
--

A list of important cases that set precedent. Any cases denoted as 'Vs Civcraft' are moderator as opposed to player initiated.



* Scylla Vs Civcraft : Actions that are statistically impossible are considered ""proof beyond a reasonable doubt"" 

* IPartyOnYourDog Vs Civcraft: If for some reason you want to be banned we will skip the formalities and oblige you. 

* RegalCheese Vs Civcraft: Duplication of items using a client mod is considered cheating


* Summoner Vs MineCraftIsFTW: [Use of Nodus or possession of other cheating mods is not alone grounds for a ban



------


Alt-Account policy
------

Civcraft uses a special alternate account detector script to find and prevent the use of alternate accounts to escape pearling. Any account you have ever used to log onto Civcraft is considered your alt and the script may create a chain of associations between accounts detected as your alts and other accounts regardless of other factors. If the script results in a false association as it often will you may be banned without actually having two pearled alts


------

Civcraft administration policy
---

* Civcraft admins exist to create

* In situations where the above directive has been compromised admins may interfere to correct the game world from the flaw in mechanics. The players in question are to present to the subreddit

* Depending on the conclusion of the administration from the presented reasoning changes will be made to resolve the situation to one resembling the outcome of correct mechanics

* If there is reasonable evidence to conclude that an in game action violates the directive and has irreversible consequences an individual can make a post filing for an injunction such that the action in question be paused and discussed in the policy outlined in the second bullet

* As in player accusation policy this is an adversarial system, it will be ignored, instead make all arguments with the opposing party. 

----

**Banned player association** 
-----

Due to the nature of Minecraft Civcraft may often have cases where players are banned for cheating and then proceed to return through evasive use of stolen or new accounts to continue playing with and being supplied by their same in game group. With the goal of properly enforcing cheating rules and make less effective alt evasion to continue cheating on our server we have instituted penalties for players knowingly associating with and supplying banned players. A player who associates with a cheater who has been **previously convicted and banned** in such a way that it is unreasonable to assume they where unaware of the cheaters banned status they will be banned from the server for a short period as a warning. Continued association will result in longer and longer sentences.

-------

------

* We have the fixed map now, they will now be regenerated in vanilla style, so if you find yourself in a vanilla chunk when you login, say hi! You crashed the server. 

* Updated Dyncap to a new version

* I tried messing with the nocheat settings to get the block reappearing thing to go away

* As I have discussed in previous change logs it seems that software optimization goes a lot further than hardware optimization when it comes to what we are doing. This begs the question of if it is a better investment to rent better hardware or put that same money towards development of optimizations. [Intreppid](https://www.intreppid.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0) seems reasonable, and Stammius charges an arm and a leg for DDOS protection so it makes me kinda suspicious. 


* Decreased hostile mob spawn cap from 20 to 15 per chunk. 

* consider adding easier ways to acquire ender pearls when spawn rates are heavily nerfed. 

* Downgraded RealisticBiomes to initial version from the 19th.

* We need JukeAlert SQL batching and indexing as well as a entry limit. 

* RealisticBiomes needs to use a real sql db with batching and indexing as well. 


* How are the plugins working for everyone? Any problems to report or feature requests to make?

1358996517.0,1760lw,On Operation Liberty Rising.,eaglesrock57,78,15,154,"To begin - the objective of this operation was not to fight. We were in no way looking for a conflict or battle. In this post ( http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/172pbi/gonna_free_some_prisoners_tonight/ ), tonight. It was stated, even though the prisoners had served their sentences and most all of the server agreed it was time they were freed.

That said, we were simply attempting to free those that we consider innocent or pearled unjustly.* 

And thus, Prussians, statists, and nomads of the server - and met in Liberty to move on what was once the 0,0 monument. We stopped to regroup in Chesterstead, and were met with the face of first crashete and a few others. I will restate this before I go on - *our objective was NOT a fight, we did not intend to engage these other players

I'm not sure who struck first, Atrvmis, Livided, Twiggy, and fart arrived on the scene within moments, and our two sides clashed. The battle came to grounds in the land between Chesterstead and 0,0. It started out grim for our side - two losses for us near the beginning - but things turned around quickly. Both sides gained momentum as we twirled and pearled around the battlefield,0

After some conflict at the old 0, and the same for our players on their side. The gear of the fighters on the opposing WuTang/Dionysian side had run its course, and they retreated. Therefore, we did the same, and the fight ended. 

**To conclude:** We - *a collective group of the majority of the server's dominant factions* - attempted to free the innocent prisoners of Spurion's vault. Members of the HCF/Wutang/Dionysian Empire would either have none of this, and our end objective was not reached. 

**To the HCF/Wutang/Dionysian Empire members:** I hope you see this for what it is, I'm not sure which side struck first, be it crashete or one of my group. But please understand this was not our intention. We were simply acting on the information from Fluffy's post and our own desire to free the imprisoned people of a server we know and love. Y_ankees, in his recent post, stated ""It appears that someone important to the fallen world police is housed there"" and, in fact, this is true. Not because one of our close friends is placed in there, but for the simple fact that *each and every single person that called this server home is important to us.* We all have our roots here

All we were hoping for was a few hours of time to free innocents (as proclaimed by many of yourselves along with many of us) from a vault you did not have access to.

**To the people of the server, free and pearled players alike:** I apologize if you feel caught up in all of this without your knowledge or without your consent. As I've stated in the post, we intended to get you innocents out, and hopefully return to the normal everyday life of the server. This: http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/175rwm/bad_news_for_good_people/ is not our doing, it is the result of a series of bad reactions to good things, a series of reactions that could have been avoided had the opposing side not simply wanted to fight us. 

Our intentions had been made clear well before we organized ourselves for the operation tonight, but the response from the HCF side showed much more hostility than we had ever intended. I hope both sides can see the battle today for what it is, and not an expression of power or intent to rid anyone from the server.

Thank you.

As Mayor ttk2 said, we’re taking the process in-house. There *are* going to be a lot of times when we have to reveal to the accused (if not by name at least in implication) where the alleged violation occurred, but sometimes we will just be able to confirm by teleporting to the person and watching them for a bit.

What this means for you, and have Judges handle it from there. This probably isn’t going to make a large difference, other than the fact that there may be slightly less fodder for /r/SRD.
 
Now to address a major problem we’ve been having. As many of you have noticed, some on VPNs. We take this as seriously as you do – keeping your faith in the game is my primary objective. Judges, however, have a tough job. It is difficult to tie accounts to specific banned players. I cannot just ban on suspicion, because every citizen deserves better than that. At the same time, we have to change tack.
 
The first act of the Grand Hall Of Justice is to announce and enforce new Laws against aiding and abetting banned players. Getting caught circumventing a ban may carry consequences up to and including: clearing the inventories of close associates, and in some cases pearls taken in battle that even included one banned player may be unpearled.

If you know your associates are alts of banned players, but get it done as quickly as possible if you value playing on this server.

1360291462.0,183vfx,[CivTest] Next Generation Map Generation,Jayrate,74,8,60,"The link for the map cross-section is at the bottom


I've long held that map generation is one of the most effective long-term ways to alter gameplay on any Minecraft server. If you want a scarcity of a certain ore, maps can instantly convert with few issues. Plugins also require new learning for players coming from SSP or the vanilla client, which can dissuade many. (""""What is pearling?""  ""Why do blocks reappear when I break them?""  ""What's a snitch?"") Maps generated with different ore proportions or different landscapes are much easier to adjust to. Clearly, making a gameplay adjustment in the initial map generation is very preferable to a gameplay adjustment through plugins.

In CivTest, and larger caverns are all examples of this. 

One possibility we haven't tried is a different sea level or a related different ground depth. In the real world, the depth under your feet is almost always constant. ""Bedrock,"" is synonymous with a flat layer at the literal bottom of a map. But what if the distance from sea level to bedrock varied greatly? What if mountains had bedrock cores and were therefore impossible to completely cut away?

I've made a quick sketch (Sorry, the bottom layer of bedrock would dip down, with no surface indication. Players would be forced to mine around searching for these deposits, which would likely not overlap with prime farm land. Consequently, some cities would be built over large ore deposits and others in biomes conducive to agriculture or growing trees. It might be strategic to build over land with a high bedrock level to prevent attackers from tunneling beneath city walls. Railroads would need to circumvent mountain ranges instead of just plowing through them like nothing. Hopefully, forcing players to settle in various locations in order to provide all the necessary resources would encourage long-distance interaction and trade/raiding for resources.

Another new utilization of an existing mechanic in CivCraft is widespread natural reinforcement of stone. Deeper stone would be more greatly reinforced, the lightest is barely-reinforced stone, and the in-between color is of medium or strong reinforcement. Ores would be found in corresponding layers depending on rarity.

As you will also see below, that the Nether isn't included as a separate realm in the next map iteration.)

To get a look at the problem, the front pages of the last several months. What's our top drama right now? A big exposé about hackers, cheaters, alts, and various other scumbaggery. In fact, this kind of story would find itself right at home on the HCF subreddit. That's really all this type of drama is: generic, unmotivated

Does anyone remember what big drama was taking place a year ago on Civcraft? Yeah

Anyone notice any differences between those two types of drama and server-happenings? One kind is stupid and shallow and shouldn't belong in a politically-inspired community. The other type is exactly what we want to foster; a kind of situation that tests the ideas of civilizations and societies; that provides life-blood to the server. 

Even the griefing on this server has gone down the tubes. Last June when I first formed my griefing group, we failed miserably, but that's not the point. Now contrast this type of griefing with the type we get now and have gotten for several months. Gimmick Brigade, Gimmick Brigade 2.0, and a whole bunch of moronic 12-year olds who have nothing better to do than grind out Prot 4 and throw themselves in waves against towns (i.e. Orion).

Now, you will expected to pay back full damages otherwise you'll be sitting in the end. A lot of times that's all you'll have to do. For more heinous crimes people take a more punitive stance (like myself), but those are rare instances.

Another thing we pride ourselves on here is Burden of Proof. There are ways to show that crimes where committed. Combat tag shows if you strike someone and snitches show block breaks. Usually when someone accuses another of a crime

**What Should I do if I'm accused of a crime?**

The first thing you should do is go on here and demand proof. If there's no evidence of wrongdoing

If there is evidence against you

If you can't pay back damages

Al Capone and his group had a lot of power and he was able to avoid capture because the people in the area actually supported him. He harmed a lot of people

Another example would be the Columbian drug lord Pablo Escobar. He evaded the law while having caused the deaths of many people because of the community service he did. The townspeople loved Pablo Escobar and were willing to protect him. 

Both of these situations match up with these groups

The Gimmick Brigade also used fighting the HCF as a way to make them seem like what they did was not so bad. Both of these situations should be something the community is wary about.

- The worst episode of depression I've had since starting treatment

- The worst anxiety I've had from the stress of not knowing what to do with my future. It was so bad that I finally had to take some of my anxiety medication.

- Isolation that was seeming to grow into social anxiety

- Insomnia that was just making everything worst and completely reversed my sleep cycle.

I was meaning to write this earlier but I'm a pretty lazy guy and recently one of my Civcraft friends have been dealing with things that sound exactly like what I've been dealing with. So I decided to write this to let him

So pretty much my day consisted of reddit and youtube

This sudden melting of my usually cold and dark heart really hit me hard and made me reflect on my life. I realized I was an idiot for isolating myself and cutting off contact from all my friends. I recently wrote up a huge thing on Facebook explaining my situation and apologizing for cutting them off. I'm still lonely since all my friends are in University and I still don't care for talking over Facebook chat but I can deal with it now. 

Secondly, which I'm kinda glad because I don't think I could be a part of the business world as an accountant. 

Lastly I started to put my small amount of musical talent to use and have picked up playing the keyboard and seem to be doing pretty good so far for only a little bit of practice. I almost feel like picking up the guitar again

I was feeling the happiest I have ever been in life for about 2 weeks

TL;DR: There is another side to mental illness and I want others to know that.

*Preface*
Griefing is the deliberate act of destroying or ruining the structures and creations of others in-game. It involves placing or reinforcing blocks on other structures, but can also lead to all-out war, players leaving the game, and indefinite detention in the End. 

Most established players on the server have griefed at some point during their time here. Why do they reform? Is the server able to adapt to ensure all griefers become established

Although speculation as to why players of Civcraft grief has been rife since the experiment’s conception

The goal of this hopefully comprehensive study is to shed some light on the socioeconomic factors that create the ‘gerfing’ culture, what this means for crime control, punishment and prevention on the server.

I will utilise a range of both quantitative and qualitative research methods in a process of methodological triangulation. This enables me to overcome the shortcomings of both. Quantitative methodology offers a high level of reliability; that is, although lacking reliability, offers a significant level of validity - something that quantitative methodology does not. Thus, utilising a variety of methods will allow me to overcome the problems of both.

The research methods I will be utilising will be questionnaires consisting of mainly closed questions for the purposes of statistical analysis, as well as enable a detailed analysis of the impact in-game griefing has on real-world people. I will also be discussing my personal involvement in griefing, thus involving another qualitative method - that of overt participant observation - as well as my experiences as a victim of griefing. All griefers mentioned, all respondents and all interviewees will be given pseudonyms in order to remain anonymous, to avoid any ethical problems the research could encounter.

Is it to annoy? Is it to offend? Is it out of desperation? A lack of solidarity? Is griefing politically motivated? If so


**Please take the time to respond, again, you will be given a pseudonym in the final piece of research. It will really help the study.**

* **The Gear:** In order to reach your maximum protection, this is why the best possible load out it protection IV chest and legs then protection I boots with a unenchanted helmet. The reason for this is that protection enchants also make your armor take **more damage**, with this load out you would reach max EPF on the strongest items before your armor breaking. It can be really important in long fights that you have this as armor durability is everything and can be the difference between life and death. The next thing your gonna want is some solid sharpness and power. Now this is were it comes down to personal preference, knockback or no knockback. I prefer to not have it as for me i don't need to distance to switch my hotbar up and it gets in the way pounding my enemy into submission. Reasons you might want knockback on your sword would be things like environment, your connection and fps, ability to switch hotbar, or just simply wanting all enchants on your sword ;P. After you have decided if you want knockback or not you basically just want to aim for a sharp 4 fire 2 looting 3 for obvious reasons. As far as Bows go its up to you i personally dont like them and use snowballs to combat tag enemy's



* **The Potions:** Potions are a essential part of pvp and without them dont even bother entering a warzone. You always want atleast 2 instant health II potions (splash because if you need hp stopping and taking 3 seconds to drink a potion is moronic), 1 speed extended/ 2 speed II, and 1 poison extended. The reason i don't include regeneration potions and instant harming II are 1) Ghast tears are incredibly rare it seems and getting you hands on some can be difficult. 2) Instant harming II are completely worthless against a guy in full EPF as they will do half a heart on a direct hit. If you manage to get regeneration potions though make them extended unless you are a ghast breeder. On a sort off non potion related topic some people don't actually know this but milk buckets cancel poison and can be extremely useful if you get a nasty poison extended on you.


* **The Fight:** Once your actually in the fight there are a few strategies you can use to get ahead of your opponent. Ender pearling is your life and death in large scale fights, you're enemy will never know what hit them!


To wrap it all up the gear, although most the gear is factually the best for pvp. All of the potions and enchants can take you a fair bit of time to grind out and acquire which is why i recommend not practicing with it on this server. I personally have a quad spider grinder at my base and it can take me anywhere from 45 minutes to 1 hour to get to level 50. At the very least i hope this guide gave you a small under standing of pvp so there is some actual fights on this server and not just senseless slaughter on unguarded noobs that don't know how to pvp.


**Things i forgot to put in the guide**

* A full set of protection II armor is 20/25 EPF, Legs 18, boots 22. (reason boots are higher is because it is best chance for protection 2 feather falling 4.)

* After throwing a ender pearl don't keep running in that direction there is a bunch of other things you could do in that time like drink potions

Need more specifics? Here we go.

**Ores**

There's a mod on this server called mineralvein, the mod only half worked, so there are still many vanilla chunks in the world. Can't find any ores? Want to post on the subreddit? *Don't do that, silly* just walk another half a thousand meters or so and try again

**Map Reset**

When our lord and savior ttk2 feels like it. No one except him and maybe the lesser admin deities know. Just enjoy the current map while it's there

**Economy**

If you actually read about the mods, and still have to look back at it. 

Is the economy itself collapsing? Well lets take a step back. Civcraft doesn't have a universal economy. Some major items like exp stacks and diamonds generally cost about the same wherever you go, labor all depend on who's buying and selling. Some of you may have seen posts regarding iron farms. Does this mean you should raise your prostitution fees up a few irons? If you want. If you think there's too much iron circulating, raise your prices. 

**Wars**

Civcraft has a violent history. But organized faction versus faction wars simply do not happen. The closest things to wars were the Infinius raids, Havana tnt crisis, and maybe even the recent Augusta Civil War. Go read about those elsewhere or in my upcoming book *Tears on a Keyboard.*

Is there going to be a World War soon? No

**Ideologies**

There's lots of em

""So I started my own ideology, what gives?""

Just because you ""play differently than other people"" doesn't mean others are going to sit there and take it. If you are doing something someone else doesn't like

**Griefing**

Ew, post here or go on mumble. What's mumble? Return to the page and start over. Want to grief? Do it at your own will. 

""But I have alts

That's fine and dandy, then you're banned. 

""This server is weak

Unless you cheated (xray, you'll be out. Some people who did some awful shit back in the day are contributing to society currently, probably worshiping sheep or manufacturing P.

  Back in august of 2012 when i first joined, and not once did i feel threatened. I found an abandoned city, and adopted it as my own. Some of you may know this place as wolvania. I gained quite a following, and after a while we restored the town to its former glory. That was the best time for the server for me. Sure we had a griefer here and there, but it was nothing we couldn't handle. That's when the hcf invaded. These people destroyed everything they touched, and killed everyone. All for what? Just for the lulz, according to them. 

I'm not saying the HCF are still the problem, it destroyed the SERVER. All because someone couldn't cheat and steal the way they wanted. These neckbeards with to much time on their hands would get up at 3 AM and destroy peoples virtual castles, because they could. They would get up destroy, and at the end of the day, get on mumble, and talk about how they fucked our moms. (I'm looking at you theo.) I'm at fault too. I would find myself doing this, and just think ""Wtf am i doing?"" But that's the issue, or building a town, They don't have lives

To explain this in more detail, if not it will free the prisoners (if you have more than one it feeds them in alphabetical order until out of coal) please note that the cost must be coal, not charcoal or any other substitute. 

As it pertains to the server economy and operation I think its going to be interesting and present some problems as well as some solutions

Obviously this cost will have a chilling effect on large scale pearling and long term storage

The plans very little up until a point, both are insomuch as is humanly possible for us to confirm, fair. The heart and soul of the difference is in how they talk, not to me but to you. 

The simple act of being quieter about things has made all the difference in the world, nor anyone else, has the fortitude to fight an army for every step of a long journey. Its amazing how actions devoid of fanfare pass without a mention where before they would have been covered in raging debate wall to wall.  

There is an argument, that doing things this way is somehow the lesser of the solutions. That despite all the hardship lost and achievement gained things are not quite is good as they could have been. But it is only by virtue of giving up that hardship that I have been able to avoid going insane, must less continue operating the server in any acceptable capacity. 

Ultimately Civcraft is freedom. No, has been, or can be, is a product of its players, that is the goal. Strangely enough Civcraft seems more a product of this goal than a tool designed to achieve it. 

Trying to toe the line between taking burdens we can not carry or betraying some of our core principles has been a continuous challenge for administrators and in its own way for the player-base as well. When attacked people fight

Why bother then?

Civtest, in fact the explicit goal of many of the changes I would outline in a few moments is, that if you are very lucky, you just might not starve to death in your dirt hovel. 

You see the biggest problem with Civcraft is simply that there are not enough poor people

In Civtest we strive to avoid such idealism by working to amplify your misery as much as possible. 

With that in mind

* Veins: Not some, which you have to find either through sheer luck or a deep understanding of Orthzar's troubled psyche. Now there may or may not be surface indicators that these veins exist, but what fun would telling you those be? 

* Natural reinforcement: As if the veins where not enough, no absconding with a whole vein in a few hours, you have to work at it. Diamond ore is 150 breaks, Iron 75 breaks, Redstone and coal 10. 

* RealisticBiomes and growth changes: Now you see, that is not quite miserable enough for us, so we had to do our best to make sure you starve. RealisticBiomes is a pretty simple mod, it makes bonemeal useless for growing things and make sure you can only grow crops in [these locations](http://i.imgur.com/fz7AGKA.png) or in underground farms lit by glowstone. This is combined with my own changes slowing the growth of all crops to 10% normal speed and setting wild mobs to spawn more rarely. 

* Now, is very simple, you get to use [MachineFactory](https://github.com/MrTwiggy/MachineFactory/wiki/MachineFactory-Documentation) to further oppress the dirty poor, simply watch the videos, burn incredible amounts of wealth (up for adjustment since i really don't think it was setup with Civtest in mind at the moment) and watch the wonderful machines do your bidding along with the wage slaves! 

* MorePhysics: As if starvation and poverty where not enough, get you run over by minecarts, and killed by bouncing. 

* Finally

So everyone, enjoy starving to death in your dirt hovels. ",,False,self,t5_2tm1t,1358625047.0,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,moderator

We did not build it, are making a different game to us. They make decisions based on a vision that we do not share. They prioritise things that are at best ambivalent for us, and at worst absolutely detrimental to the vision of what we want the game to be.

Thanks to a combination of breaking bugs and broken mechanics, and it has a lot going for it: A huge client base, low cost of entry for new players (most people have Minecraft), familiarity, well-documented modifications (whilst we constantly complain about Modding API, at least we have the shared background and ability to create somewhat passable mods), an intensely active dev-orientated userbase (Bukkit/Spigot etc), one that I'm proud to be a very very tiny part of. Rather

Yes, or the touch screen. You with the hair, with those eyes, with all that thang goin' on in the mid'. And me too. The main problem of Civcraft, the one that makes it incredibly difficult to administrate, is that we all (well, those of us who aren't here specifically to trawl drama and generally create trouble) fell in love with a sidebar. We fell madly, that vision. Because that's the game we want to play

Falling in love with an idea is like lusting after a ghost. You can see it, and yet one that I feel most people aren't aware of: That sidebar right there, the one just to the right of the screen? Civcraft isn't that. And as long as Civcraft is tied to the Minecraft client, it can't ever be that.

None of the admins want to interfere. Firstly, given that the Minecraft client is buggy as shit and has several features that have we have a forced awareness of, we can't not. That's the be all and end all of it. As long as Minecraft is how it is, Civcraft will be how it is.

Being an Administrator on Civcraft is an act of maintenance. Every time Bukkit updates, we have to draw back the line and maintain it. That's what we are. We aren't judiciaries or lawmen or authoritarians or developers: We're janitors, and it's our job to make sure the piles of trash don't overflow and ruin everyone's day.

As much as we'd like to never have to manually pearl someone again, dressed him up in a little colour-coordinated peacoat and hat, and taught him how to be civilized. Every now and then he remembers what he is, rears his head, goes wild for a bit and we have to put his little hat back on, and it would be a better time for everyone if the playerbase could just accept this for what it is.

In conclusion, the vision that we attempt to adhere to, the cleaned up picture of the fast food burger in the TV advert. It's what we want to be, but it isn't what we are. We've come closer than any other Minecraft server online today, maybe even any other videogame, but we aren't there yet. We might never be there, and because of that certain inevitabilities should be presumed.

Finally

1) The sidebar is not a justification for being a prick. Minecraft's shitty mechanics allow for small coordinated groups to, and does not match that sidebar-vision of an actual simulation of society, so using the sidebar as a justification for this sort of behaviour is ridiculous.

2) We are a very small team of human beings, people wont notice you've done anything at all,"" and in my short time here as an administrator I'm inclined to believe that. An incredible amount of work goes in behind the scenes just to maintain the bullshit we have now, and almost all of the work done by our devs is volunteered and unrewarded.

3) You are not privy to all the information we are. You can argue all day about how you want absolutely no intervention on this server or whatever, pretty much as good as it gets. As I said before, we are not perfect, but I think we've all done pretty well over the past 9 months. Especially me. Don't tell anyone, but I'm pretty much the best. I'm the breadwinner baby.

The players involved for the initial finding were Yakman1(me)

**We used world downloader and not x-ray.** We could have just has easily explored the vault with an older download that was publicly distributed [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/v8t4f/download_columbia/?sort=top) The same vulnerability existed then too, he was ""X-raying"".)

We found the flaw where no one else did for months and months by doing several pratice attempts against the vault in order to understand the problem. No one used x-ray during this time and I have no idea why one would even  think that x-ray would help find the path we found. There are plently of crevices of dirt and stone around the bedrock and making out a continuous path like the one we found would be near impossible with X-ray. You would just see a bunch of lines and random patterns everywhere.
We found the tunnel by digging around in a downloaded version of the map in a different server.(We were also trying to get vault design ideas for our own design, leaving a smaller path for the final 1 person stretch. Because of this, we began checking the sides and quickly saw that the outermost rim of the obsidian overlapped unprotected dirt and bedrock in varios places. The natural course from there was to find the optimal crevice in the dirt and stone that would give us a good head start. We dug out all around, and the head start we found was quite a head start. We found it not when no one else did for 6 months or more not because we did anything unfair or unprecedented, but because we were naive enough to try, and because we actually worked on it rather than accepting defeat.



**The legality:**(please read along [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/13wxdf/codification_of_cheating_policy))

**on cheating:**

These actions are definitely outside of the definition of cheating provided by ttk2 in 1. and 2. above.

There are second hand reports of ttk2 personally allowing the use of world downloader [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1584zs/so_here_is_your_question/c7k3nxk) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1584zs/so_here_is_your_question/c7k8frr).

**on precedent:**
No relevant precedent exists in the thread above about banning for use of world downloader in the manner we used it
There is precedent for the legality of the use of the world download mod is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/12zt25/is_your_computer_literally_on_fire/) and [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/v8t4f/download_columbia/?sort=top). Of course this may not imply that all uses are legal. It seems that anyone using it is overwhelmingly likely to have gained some information that they could not have gained given where they actually stood in game while the downloading occured. Also the nature of our use was very typical of what the mod tends to be used for on the server as far as I can tell from discussing with several people.(anyone reading please post more specific examples of past uses if possible)
Tactful has claimed that use of world downloader to see any blocks that one was not in a position to see is by definition equivalent to x-ray.

First note that because these methods are not real time

Further

1.) X-ray allows one to make a determination about the existence of some occluded condition of interest without any active search.(I think this is not actually true in our case as explained above) Our motivation to dig around came from a conscious exploratory effort

2.) X-ray allows one to greatly reduce the search time to find some occluded object of interest

3.) If breaking downloaded blocks is the nonrealtime ""functional equivalent"" of X-ray

I do accept the point that in a sense we circumvented snitches by gaining information about the map while avoiding the snitch networks that would have tracked us given we had done the same thing in game.(We did not circumvent citadel in a similar way because the blocks we needed to break to find the tunnel were not actually enforced at all in game.) This is a good point

Maybe one could make a new rule that normal information gathering while avoiding snitches in this way is against the rules

To summarize the legality points:

1.) What we did was not cheating under the rules and had no relevant ban precedent.

2.) There is precendent for several legal uses of world downloader

3.) Tactful's legal reasoning for a new rule against using world downloader in this way

4.) Tactful's simplistic case for functional equivalence to X-ray for producing this new rule does not hold up to scrutiny.

What we did to find what we found was legal. No one found what we found for all these months because no one tried like we tried. We came at the problem without accepting the collective defeatist delusion that the vault can not be broken and the world police cannot be beaten. X-ray would not have solved the problem

Also please remember that breaking the vault took about 7 hours during which we had to fight off several ""world police"" between 3-4 of us guarding the surface. What we found reduced the required time

1360392059.0,186kdn,PSA: Snitch Mechanics and You,Clasp,64,7,16,"One of the most powerful and under-utilized techniques in Civcraft is the expansion of the snitch range. Veterans who have been here for many months more than me didn't know about this method for altering snitch ranges so I have made this handy guide.

The information I am laying out is freely available on the [PreciousStones wiki](http://wiki.sacredlabyrinth.net/index.php/PreciousStones#Cuboid_Fields). The wiki also has a [convenient video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=d7_VVz8fIPY) that will help you understand.

**Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. Place a snitch
1. The snitch now forms one corner of its detection radius. [Look at another block far away from you and left click](http://i.imgur.com/QlGzwpd.jpg). This will set the other corner of the detection area and creating the bounding box for the snitch. The corners are demarked by obsidian
1. [Point and left click at another point that is outside your bounding box](http://i.imgur.com/z3XdJbo.jpg). The bounding box will expand to fit the new corner that you have created. You can expand the bounding box by a set amount of blocks until it is maxed out. 
1. When you are happy with your new snitch detection radius
1. You will be notified that [the snitch cubiod field is closed](http://i.imgur.com/Pc4b3hw.jpg). A bedrock frame will then [trace](http://i.imgur.com/PAOrNnc.gif) your bounding box.

**Q&amp;A:**

*-Wait a second


Yes it is. That is why people have to know about it. You are _only_ limited by the total area that the snitch can take

*-But I thought minecraft would crash when you tried this?*

It still does. There is significant trial and error involved with this method. Standing in the way of the bedrock tracing will crash minecraft. Walking through the glass pillars will sometimes crash minecraft. Placing a corner of the bounding box on a door can crash minecraft. However

What we're beginning to see is a disregard for national sovereignty. Both collectivists and individualists should see both how it is morally wrong to attack voluntary groups that enforce laws on their property

I think what we must realise that if you do not respect a nations laws, be subject to your laws. let's say hypothetically that a griefer was pearled and given a long sentence. then we see the friends of that griefer (that griefed on 1.0) attack a respected member of the community, why on earth shouldn't I feel that I am not subject to the laws of the griefers town and burn it to the ground? A violation of sovereignty leads to a massive collapse of order. 

essentially, in what way would an attack on them to force them to release him and change their laws be illegitimate?

And why is it so essential that we respect sovereignty and make sure ? firstly we don't have the nether anymore, are playing less too.

On the Moral side, and further we are seeing these grief victims that are keeping us safe from people, (who guess what, wont reform, and certainly not without a very long sentence.) being given ""a taste of their own medicine"", when all they've done is good and non aggressive. 

The development of civ 2.0 is dependent almost entirely on us maintaining order on our own in our entire regions

1360543292.0,189zui,Call for Programmers: New mod FactoryMod to overhaul Civcraft ,manintime,71,11,57,"ttk2 has expressed great enthusiasm at the design for this mod. We need programming help to make it happen. The description of it

**FactoryMod**

**Introduction**

FactoryMod is intended to fulfil four roles:

1.	Create a “Capital goods” dynamic within minecraft by providing a set of buildable

2.	Create a more balanced “consumer economy” by providing a tech tree with more inputs and outputs

3.	Balance the added difficulty of mining with natural reinforcement.

4.	Make the tech tree much more diverse and require cooperation and specialisation to efficiently utilise technology.

FactoryMod allows the creation of factories – buildings with a physical presence that produce certain goods. For most of the goods produced

A useful side-effect of FactoryMod is that it removes XP grinding as a key component of the economy (mob grinding will still be useful

**Factory categories**

There are four categories of factories

**Production Factories** are the most specialised and diverse category of factory. These factories take a set of inputs and convert them to a set of outputs. These factories are the key to making tools, armour and tools above stone require tech buildings.

**Mining Factories** dig down into the ground and scoop everything up into their chest. Mining factories require fuel or power to operate and can dig deeper into the ground depending on how high tech they are. 

**Power Factories** provide power to the other types of factories

**Farming Factories** help with the production and processing of food products. Their effectiveness can be increased if they are powered.

**Design Principles**
There are some general principles that guide the design of the factory buildings themselves:

*Diversity* – it is intended that climbing the tech tree for any type of production will require materials from different biomes

*Aesthetic* – It is intended that each category of factory have it’s own aesthetic and that each type of building looks unique – however

*Difficulty* – Higher tech buildings must require production outputs from lower tech buildings – as such

**(Tentative) In-game Mechanic**
The placing of a Lapis control block next to a chest and furnace triggers the test for whether a factory is created.
 
The chest contents are then examined for the “extra cost” for the factory – these tell the mod which factory to search for and establish it’s orientation.

If an unreinforced factory shaped building with the correct blocks is detected, the factory is created at that place.

Upon creation

Every production cycle

Each production cycle

Power supply is provided by some kind of pipe from a power building to the structure

A villager can be attached to the factory. The villager greatly speeds the operation of especially higher tech level buildings but is very hungry! Different structures require different food for their villagers and higher tech ones require multiple types of food/combo foods.

1367638746.0,1dnthf,[Suggestion] Remove the ability to dye sheep to create a larger market for dyes.,kwizzle,66,10,54,"###What should be changed

* I think that removing the ability to dye sheep would greatly expand the market for dyes.  If we remove this ability

### What this would entail

* This would encourage trade and specialization as players wouldn't simply be able to dye their sheep once and breed them to forever.

* This would increase demand for flowers, lapis and cactus.  The most recent iteration of factory mod does use cactus for an xp recipe so this would actually create an interesting dynamic where certain colors of wool would be worth more than others because of the inherent value or scarcity of the resources used to dye them (Think of the Romans and their oh so expensive and prestigious purple dyes).

* Certain colors of wool may become signs of wealth

### Notes

* If we decide to go through with this modification we should allow bonemeal to grow flowers and grass (This was removed in the last Civtest that I played

* Dye was an important factor in the wealth of the Renaissance cities of Florence (Producer of cloth) and Venice (Importer of dye components from the Ottomans).  

* It would be interesting to see such luxury goods play a role in Civcraft 2.0

* If we go through with this then we would have to disable the spawning of naturally colored sheep. 

* I have no idea if this is possible or practical to implement server side,False,self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,t3_1dnthf

The following thread is a formal accusation of cheating against players ""Richard_T"", by his own admittance. These three characters are accused of using X-ray or World Downloader as a substitute, or similar means to see through blocks. The evidence is as presented as follows. 


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Facts**

The following accusation revolves around the breaking into my prison vault. However, removed from the chests of pearls by at minimum 2 DRO in a diagonal and level-changing direction. 

* There were zero pearls in this dispenser when it was broken

The accused, 1 diamond block. It was the only dispenser in the vault.

* The only blocks broken aside from those to initially get to the pearl chests, etc... They mined right to it, as if they magically knew it was there. There were two other blocks broken going south, but the reasoning for this was completely fabricated.


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Snitch and Image Evidence**

If you take a look at the recent griefing attacks you will find one thing about every attacked city, they can not be blown up, and to level them requires a griefers greatest enemy, destruction without rage. Buildings in Minecraft are normally easy to build and repair and equally easy to destroy. But citadel changes that it makes griefers take time, so much time to level a building, and with no player yelling in rage motivating that destruction becomes more difficult. 


Stone was not meant to be ""the poor mans lock"" the philosophy of Citadel is not  like LWC , yet no one is buying, people have yet to realize that citadel is not just for chests and doors like LWC or they would be gobbling up cobble to reinforce every block they place. That's why we have a toggle command so that every block you place can be simply reinforced. 


If you use Citadel when you build when grifers come simply log out, and act as an advantage. Going out to fight them is to abandon your defenses, Citadel gives defenders an advantage, if they can change the way they think about Minecraft combat enough to take advantage of it. Your walls have a purpose now, build them high and thick give yourself something to defend.  

Citadel was made in part to address the problem that building 


So it seems I have , but forgotten the simple lynch pin of explaining the idea behind it. I hope this gives you new insight into Citadel, and griefers a challenge which they have never encountered before.

This is a tale about freedom on the 4th of July. This story will give you a warm fuzzy feeling in your heart. There is no drama. There is no circlejerk. There is only justice. 


Our story begins in Orion roughly two days ago when a group of griefers heavily griefed Orion. Lava poured from the skies, the self-named ""Butter Brigade"", bragged about having 15 members. They claimed to be from HCF, and said they were here to break out the BK. They announced intentions of pearling the leaders of every leader in CivCraft to Ron Jeremy their e-peens. Here is a list of the involved accounts:

* legitlazyboy
* StingrayJT
* ColtVonHugenDong
* Look_Out
* FuturizeHandgun
* monkeyfatzer
* Aryios
* sirdemonic3
* EldooCide (Claims to be their leader)
* yoIyo
* EpicPoodle (Recent discovery


When this all started, they struck again. This time pearling numerous Orion officials (Itaqi, firewarlord) and citizens. They were placed in a 6-7 (Someone else may remember better than I) layer DRO vault, with an additional 5 in SRO. A number of people came to help, including Shamrock Jones of The Metro and other Orion citizens. However, the group came back. Legitlazyboy, Aryios, placing them in the vault. 


**Where the story gets especially interesting:**

After pearling the folks in Orion, a force amassed in Solis. Approximations lie at 20 people in total being involved on our side. Representatives were present from almost every city in the -,-. Solis made up a majority of the force and provided hospitality to several travelers by giving them food or spare pearls. Additionally, combatants arrived hailing from a diverse range of sources, including Minas Minas, Kappi, Freedom, Haven, combatants donated armour, everybody in that market place knew we were going to kick ass


Never had 16 bit shiny teal-coloured avatars fill me with so much pride. We sprinted in waves towards the vault, their numbers spanning the minimap and our fields of view. A battle ensued for a short time before the griefers retreated. Their side's first to be pearled was Aryios, minutes into the fight. After being combat-tagged, a knockback sword (Mine) threw him into a ravine , where he promptly died. I don't think he even got a hit off on anybody. 


After this, please correct me if I'm wrong) was pearled shortly after bravely placing lava in the only exit from the vault, helping damage the fuckers before the fight even started. Hats off to her. Her Prison Pearl broadcasts played their role in the chase, giving legitlazyboy's location to everybody in the mumble. For reasons I don't quite know, (This is a story for those involved to share themselves) gongshow, while originally accompanied by others, was left alone to face legitlazyboy and was killed


Additionally pearled was StingrayJT


Meanwhile, at which point adambrooks killed, but didn't pearl him. The fight changed focus after that. Those who were still up for a chase headed towards Orion, some staying behind to store what pearls we had. Yet another wave of attacks came across Orion when the retreating forces dropped off the pearls of the casualties from The Metro - those who had still been digging at the DRO vault there found their spots lava-griefed when they logged back in. 


Without ppbroadcasts, nearby citizens from Orion and Haven came to help their fallen allies. Eff picks were shared and passed around, and food was provided for those that made the long way south through the seemingly endless mountain ranges that divide The Metropolis from the Orion-Haven area. Finally, shortly after midnight, the DR chest was broken and the victims were free. 


Warm cuddly feelings were had by all, and Orion popped up, happy to be free. The remaining group huddled together to share a p potion together as the brief celebration went on. And somewhere nearby, watching us somehow, [a cold congratulations was passed on to the survivors.](http://imgur.com/fBOHmqi)

There are many reason why you could not join the server. Make sure you entered the right address in your Minecraft client. The server address is *untamedears.com*. One of the various Minecraft service might be down which would explain why you cannot join. In order to connect to a server

The server might also be full. In that case

**I just joined and I keep on dying of hunger. Where do you find food?**

The first thing you should do is get yourself a wood sword and kill a few animals. If you cannot find animals

**I just joined and I cannot find anyone around. Where is everyone? How do I find my way around?**

The world map is pretty big. Many people hang out in towns or cities. The [Nether Map](http://www.hpoom.co.uk/CivCraft/map.php) gives you Nether and Overworld coordinates for many know places when you hover on that place. You can push F3 to see your own coordinates when you are in the Minecraft client. Many places are or have been deserted. To find out the active places

**I just joined. Where is the best place for me to get started?**

There is no definitive answer to that question. If you joined with a few friends, see which places have people in it and talk with those people. Most of them are friendly and they will most likely invite you to join them if you ask them.

Alternatively

**I just joined and I cannot find ores in the ground. I keep digging but I only see stone around. Where can I find iron

You are most likely in a mineral vein chunk. There are two kind of chunks on Civcraft

Mineral vein is a program that was ran on the original map to change the ore distribution. It removes all the ores from the ground and place veins of different ore in a compact region but all sparsely separated from each others. Places where you dig and you can only find cobblestone/stone are places where mineral vein was ran on. You still get a chance to find a vein full of the same ore

Mineral vein was not able to transform the whole map for different reasons. That left some chunks in their natural state something we call vanilla chunks. Vanilla chunks are mostly away from 0

I suggest you move somewhere else where you can find vanilla chunks. Chunks around Mt. Augusta should be vanilla chunks.

**How do I protect my stuff? Why can't I break some blocks?**

Civcraft includes a modification called Citadel that helps protect your stuff from other people and it deter you from breaking other people stuff. You can use materials to reinforce existing blocks or blocks you place around. You can also lock doors, have a look at [the wiki page](http://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=mods:citadel) for this mod.

**Some people seem to know where I am

Civcraft includes a modification called PreciousStone. The snitch is the only part of that modification that is included. Snitches are vanilla jukeboxes that were simply placed around and that act somewhat like local presence detector. They provide their owner with live alert if someone pass by and they record actions that were performed by others close by the snitch.

To make a snitch, check [the wiki page](http://civcraft.org/doku.php?id=mods:preciousstones) for this mod.

**How can I use and create shops?**

Civcraft includes a modification called Physical Shop. It enables the creation of shops where people can trade stuff without having to be online or having to be at the same place at the same time. Shops can be easily recognized by having a sign above a chest with an item name or item id between square brackets as the first line written on the sign. You can buy or sell items to the shops by having that item in your hand and right-clicking on the sign.

You will want to protect your shops with Citadel. Make sure you reinforce the block behind your sign

To create your own shop

**Where did people get emeralds? Is it possible to store experience?**

Civcraft includes a modification called BottleO. Is can be used to store experience in exp bottles

**I keep hearing people talk about pearling others. What is this? How can I enforce rules on others?**
**I am in the end world and I am not able to leave it. What happened to me?**

Civcraft includes a modification called PrisonPearl. It enables players to imprison other players in the end. [This infographic](http://i.imgur.com/XbhkK.jpg) is a good introduction to this mod. You can check out [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/149p1f/what_is_pearling_exactly/c7b5oku) for all other related FAQ about PrisonPearl.

**I keep hearing people talk about vaults. What is this? How can I secure pearls?**

A vault is simply a highly reinforced construction mainly used to store pearls. People surround their pearl (or other items) containers with a large amount of diamond reinforced obsidian (DRO). Since DRO is the best possible protection you can have for anything

**What is the world size?**

The world is limited to around a 15000 block radius circle around 0

**Would you have any other suggestions for a new player?**

Yes. You might want to install and configure various client-side modifications to have a pleasurable experience. Here are a few of them that I highly suggest:

- [OptiFine](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/249637-147-optifine-hd-b6-fps-boost-hd-textures-aa-af-and-much-more/): Better Minecraft speed/farther possible distance view.
- [Rei's Minimap](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/482147-147-jan10-reis-minimap-v32-06/): Terrain mini map and waypoints.
- [RadarBro](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1040810-146-radarbro-gui-mobplayer-radar/): Players radar.
- [ArmorStatusHUD](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1114612-147-bspkrs-mods-armorstatushud-v14-directionhud-v18-statuseffecthud-v17/): On screen armour and tools status (Mostly for PVP).
- [StatusEffectHUD](http://www.minecraftforum.net/topic/1114612-147-bspkrs-mods-armorstatushud-v14-directionhud-v18-statuseffecthud-v17/): On screen status effects and remaining time (Mostly for PVP).

Installation and configuration is left as an exercise to the reader.

    ok everyone its time to get started

    First of all I would like to thank everyone for taking the time to come here

    I am sure our hosting company is giving our bandwith graphs a very confused look right now

    More than a year ago now Civcraft first game online an I cant say I ever expected to end up here

    With 200+ of my strangest friends

    I chose the firt for this meeting because its important to me

    so long ago

    untouched after more than a year

    If you walk downstairs and find the farm you will see the hole where my prison once was

    someone in our esteemed audience today

    while it was situations like this that eventually lead to me steping down from playing

    it never stopped me from forming an attachment to this place

    20

    more than 20

    20

    Somehow it makes the 14gigs of the server map feel much heavier

    and seem so much larger

    But I could have never gotten here without the support of my players

    you know

    through thick and thin

    its nearly impossibly constant

    of the players as it is mine that we can continue to run this server

    people say that Civcraft shows the worst in people

    you will find somthing worthwhile

    but I say Civcraft shows the best of people

    the effort and commitment shown in keeping the server alive

    an incredible testimate to all of you

    I am saying goodby to the rift and this map along with all of you

    going forwards I will no longer be a player

    become a literall situation

    If civcraft is to continue to thrive

    the admins need to stay close to the game

    the players are doing anymore

    I hope to spend more time listening to all of you in mumble and continue at least trying to

    keep up with the subreddit

In light of over a year of Civcraft History and many many recent events I think it is time we all have a relevant and necessary discussion as Civcraftians:

+ Does no rules really mean no rules? Or is this an outline from the admin team that allows us to chart our collective destiny as players?

+ Is *griefing* (killing/pearling innocents

+ If griefing is indeed never acceptable is it then time we recognize that the people who are against us may not only be outsiders but rather specific individuals who have slipped in among us? Enemies within.  

+ What should be done when we catch both new and old members of the community who carry out these terrible and harmful acts? 

We are over a year into this experiment and I for one want to see a server culture where laws are respected. A community where more nations and cities can grow and prosper with out fear of oppression from criminals and/or griefers. 

Most people I speak with want to see a Civcraft Experiment where tyranny and oppression are snuffed out before it can take root.

The power to change our community is ultimately in our own hands and we need only to reject fear and move towards what we desire most.

VIII) Various historic screenshots


**To conclude**

It's been fun, who I am honored to have befriended, for tolerating my *mania grandiosa* regarding architecture and how I mostly just came up with grand visions that never reached fruition. I hope I *at least* managed to get Rapture on the map with the Grand Library I designed and built.

If I should get some time to, since that can be done where ever as long as I have a surface and something to write with.

- Base of outer city (between the 2 outer walls) is Y:10
- Each ""step"" is 30 tall. (putting the the top at 220)
- outer wall radius is 250m
- Built on world Border

Design Inspirations:

- Outer structure is a tall stacked castle inspired by: [Minas Tirith](http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100116234231/lotr/images/e/e4/Minas_Tirith.jpg)

- Inside the outer structure will be an internal city inspired by [Erebor from The Hobbit

- architectural style with have certain elven flairs to call to Gondolin's elven heritage

- Major design requirements is defensibility and home field advantage.

- Single building ""palette"" but a unique diverse design. I really love this particular [lego model](http://i.imgur.com/j8aGQgv.jpg). No building is the same

To embark on such an incredibly epic project... It will require many people.

I am first looking for:

- a group of experienced architects. (we will be playing around on a creative server quite a bit)
- Diggers to dig in a vanilla area (and keep what they find)
- Wall builders to start building the structure. (especially people experienced at technical building

I will also be looking to have discussions with leaders across the server to determine ways Gondolin can be a place they feel comfortable participating in as an external entity (past just building an embassy).

Civcraft has done an excellent job in ironing out the majority of these inherent flaws. We have varying terrain, the ore vein system, etc. We have harsher food growing conditions and factories to foster communities being built and to punish the single pioneer. 

What remains unchanged

My suggestion to fix this final problem would be to remove military enchantments altogether and to give all bows some slight improvements. This could be in the form of a default enchantment, require all armors beyond leather (or iron?) be built in a factory, and all weapons beyond stone (or iron?) be constructed in a factory. 

I recognize that this is an unpopular opinion

Some other thoughts: the EXP market would crash. Enchanted pickaxe prices would go through the roof. Experience

Diamond armor is now limited to those who have/have access to the incredibly expensive diamond armor factories. What this means is that those who have access can now set the prices for diamond armor as they see fit. This also means that iron armor will have a real place in military conflicts

Another thing that has always bothered me is that the wealthiest players on civcraft generally have Prot IV. If the best they could have is plain ol' diamond I think we would see lot of more interesting highway robberies

&gt;If NoLagg is right

&gt;If everything related to the writeLock is run on the server's main thread or as a synchronous task, by default 300 (15 seconds). That's a long time to queue up chunks to unload. Maybe manually take control of the task scheduling instead of having it a repeating task. Have it check the time before it starts unloading chunks. Once it has taken more than a couple milliseconds to run, have it break the loop and schedule itself to run again in 2 or 3 ticks. Once the chunksToUnload queue is empty have it schedule itself to run again in 300 ticks. This way chunk unloads occur slowly instead of hammering the system all at once if there were a very large number of chunks queued over the 15 seconds.

The first that I think would revolutionize combat and empower groups of people

Things pearls prevent:

- As long as you have pearls
- surrounding an enemy is impossible. at anytime they can teleport 60 blocks in any direction.
- Engagements become erratic and random to quickly. People pearl off and disappear
- A single person can ""alliojuke"" all day long a group of people and never get caught. People should be able to corner and trap an individual

Disabling pearls would buff:

- Groups. You can effectively surround a lone target
- Bows. Walls and towers ACTUALLY MATTER. Shoot away
- getting stuck in a hole SUCKS. You are gonna die.
- slowness, you are probably in trouble without a speed II.
- Speed II
- Archers not in full prot. A line of guys in prot can hold the front while archers are more protected in the back. People have to run through
- Strategic engagement and positioning. People have to think of their escape route... how they enter in a building
- Armor Weights more meaningful *(Antonius)*

Disadvantages of Disabling teleportation:

- harder to engage/disengage large groups when you get in trouble
- combat will result in one of the combatants dying more often
- closing on petty griefers (those without pearls) will be a little harder. Harder to catch people before log off.
- Getting away is to easy *(Joshua)*
- possibly crushes the pearl market *(Antonius)*

Anything else people can think to contribute? I will add them to this post as people propose them.

AnCraPzPReZaDeNT himself made it known that advocates on his behalf were eager to grief Valenti for our involvement, the day after AnCraPz's ban was announced, serverError404 took it upon himself to join the LSIF mumble channel and begin harassing bananafone31 there, calling her a cunt and railing about the perceived 'unfairness' of the ban.

And so
&gt;""You knew you were going to get pearled. I was in the Batcave when you were discussing going to Valenti and creating a Klan Outpost outside the city. You knew they would pearl you

Further, and also corroborates blueavenue's quote regarding serverError404's intentions in coming to our town.

It has been suggested that serverError404 only trespassed in chat radius and bananafone31 chased him down and killed him without giving him time to respond to her instruction to leave. Snitch evidence does not back that up.

[Here is a log of serverError404's entry to town

[This is an illustration of the locations of pings](http://makeagif.com/media/2-26-2013/o6mSkL.gif).

[This video may help put the actual buildings into context](http://youtu.be/vTMb0LkTq40). Keep in mind that a) this is simply a direct path point-to-point, presumably to find a way inside.

**The conclusions from our perspective:**

1) serverError404 has a history of harassment towards bananafone31

2) serverError404's messaging of bananafone31 was not random

3) serverError404's arrival at Valenti was not accidental; he certainly was aware that he would not be a warmly-welcomed guest due to his history with bananafone31 and support of AnCraPzPReZaDeNT; and he came with the intent to start trouble

4) serverError404 did not merely hang in chat radius

5) serverError404 was asked to leave

and finally 6) the killing and subsequent pearling of serverError404 was justified per Valenti law

------------------------------------------------

**A show of force**

Very soon after the pearling

Meanwhile

[A short scuffle broke out](http://imgur.com/a/HRPNS); it eventually petered out and Valenti was left at peace for a couple of hours.

------------------------------------------------

**The griefing of Valenti**

[whosnick's helpfully-supplied pictures from the first night of griefing](http://imgur.com/a/BGf1M)

On February 23rd a large group of invaders came to Valenti. Some focused on the vault, they retreated. [On February 24th, they returned for a repeat session](http://imgur.com/a/jRufQ), this time successfully freeing serverError404. It's been claimed over and over again that whosnick is the one who griefed Valenti and the others present were just there for serverError404. The pictures speak for themselves.

**[And serverError404 continues his harassment

------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion**

Valenti is not particularly interested in reparations from the above individuals. We are, rather isolationist town. In spite of peoples' prejudices against us, we are not advocating for SRS-style restrictions world-wide. Nonetheless, we encourage the server community to look over the above evidence, consider the nature of the people involved, and decide in which kind of world you want to exist. Don't allow hate and harassment to flourish under threat of lava reprisals, or you'll soon have a pristine landscape full of bigots and unimaginative trolls.

-----------------------------------------------

**Thanks**

The server does have a large body of truly good people, swastikas, and other blights. There are most certainly some accidental omissions from this list; so many people came through at different hours that listing them all seems nearly impossible. We're in your debt; thank you so much.

1366904558.0,1d36vt,Regarding My Earlier Post,g10greg56,68,17,270,"I've spent the past day thinking about what I should do

Last night I was in Josh's private Mumble talking to him and Tutter (we play Mount &amp; Blade and shit together).  NJPalms entered the channel and was noticeably pissed off.  He started talking about how much he hated the Adkins of the server and that if they freed the people pearled by Hamster he was going to do something stupid.  

Palms said that, or 90 stacks of DRO.  He said that he was going to coat Civcraft with DRO.  He planned to DRO over all of the portals and fuck the nether roads.  He mentioned adding onto Berge's tower with DRO.  He said that he wanted to fill 0,0 nether side with DRO to fuck with Stonato.  Josh got on board with this plan and offered to give some of his considerable wealth (at least 15 stacks of diamond blocks) to Palms' project.

Eagles them entered the channel and they stopped talking about it for a minute.  Then

Eagles and Palms then started to talk about why and how they'd do this.  They we mad that the server no longer stood for what they believed was right and were pissed off at the ""children"" who were against them.  They decided that they'd either demoralize these ""children"" so much that they quit or force a a map reset.  They specifically singled out Stonato

Their plan to implement the griefing was to originally do it all in one might

They figured that if the did this over the course of multiple nights that on the first day the entire server would rally together to clean up the damage.  They figured that after the first day

Throughout this conversation I was trying to tell them it was a stupid idea and they wouldn't listen.  I tried to explain to Palms and Eagles that this plan was worse than what the HcF initially did and based on similar reasoning.  They wouldn't listen to me and eventually I got so pissed about their bullshit that I left the channel and went to go do something else.  

I don't know what to do about this.  I feel that this isn't enough evidence against them to pearl them, Eagles, NJPalms, Suiridax and Whosnick) as you see fit.  Be aware though that in addition to this griefing they also talked about updating Josh's copy of the infamous JHoward's client and using it.  Josh also admitted to using JHoward's on CivPVP and Civcraft in the past.  

This kind of planning is unacceptable.  It is not OK to tuck a server used by over a thousand people just because your idiocy is no longer supported.

It was a quiet evening on civcraft as I logged on in Mount Augusta. Recently I had just viewed the posts detailing a conflict brewing over New Kowloon, and then it caught on.

I was quickly making my way to my house on corner of the town and the situation was going down quickly. People were popping out of their houses and marching to the courthouse. Representatives of the government were calling for calm and peace, seemed to be leading the charge against the government, calling for lava griefings and a burning of the courthouse.  I was back at my street and was ready with diamond sword  to secede from Mount Augusta and protect the Algerian Neighborhood if central authority fell apart. An apparent pearling of CSimplify seemed to aggravate things, and calls were being made to overthrow the current government and institute a communist government.

From what I could tell on the chat while hiding in my appartment was that the protesters had marched to the courthouse but had been routed. Calls were being made to avoid griefing and lava. Things seemed to be calming down. I called a lone wanderer wandering outside into my apartment

Then, and the jungle suddenly found itself on fire as violence erupted again. ZombieLenin seemed to be losing control of his revolutionaries and the city appeared strained beyond it's breaking point. 


**EDIT** 
Mount Augusta seems to be on the breaking point of falling apart. Different sectors, and others are threatening to secede officially if central authority or combat. More murders have occurred on top of the Tower of Nine and a fire has started. Player naeemt has been quoted as telling everyone in the city that can to evacuate as the political situation continues to spiral out of control

**EDIT 2**
Pro-government player Ave3ng3d7x has been quoted as saying ""people of mumble

**EDIT3**
Clear parties have been established in what can now be called an outright civil war: The LSIF have formed a conglomerate against the current government and have now attacked members of the current government. Anti-government members include brmj, and leader OfcourseIam. Government forces include Stuckinarut, kikariska, and TeaJizzle.

**EDIT4**
The first major government offensive has started as military moves into the street to retake seceded areas. RON_PAUL_2012 has been reported as pearling players. Businesses and homes downtown have been looted and public buildings have been set alight as the night brakes on the city riddled with public instability

**EDIT5**
Following the government offensive

**EDIT6**
The Augustan situation has returned to normal and the army continues to patrol the streets as the last whispers of the revolution are dying away.

-------

* We have a new login queue plugin

* I hate to say I told you so, this caused the slow memory growth we saw. Then the flash crashes were caused by variable load factors, sudden movement and overloading of the server could cause memory use to balloon and cause a crash. 

* There are two ways to increase the player cap, just with recent optimizations we went from 125 to 200-240 with worse hardware! Its obvious that software currently has higher returns when it comes to performance than new hardware does. 

* Increased hostile mob spawn cap from 10 to 20 per chunk. 

* consider adding easier ways to acquire ender pearls when spawn rates are heavily nerfed. 

* Downgraded RealisticBiomes to initial version from the 19th.

* We need JukeAlert SQL batching and indexing

* RealisticBiomes needs to use a real sql db with batching and indexing as well. 


* Remember this map is officially in testing until the 26th and we do reserve the right to reset things if there are very serious problems. As we discussed [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1eouvk/anyone_feel_like_resources_are_scarce_enough/ca2b21v) so far I not convinced that there are any problems of that scale. If Civcraft is to be about emergent gameplay we can not throw in the towel at the first sign of an outcome we did not expect. 



* How are the plugins working for everyone? Any problems to report or feature requests to make? 



* I would like to thank all of you

Really immerse yourself in your new community and home. Thrive as a team.

**Learning Skills**

This is what separates the standout players from the crowd. Learn a skill that you enjoy in the game. Practice it and master it and do it en masse. Do you like enchanting? Become your regions master enchanter and you will find yourself becoming a very valuable player. Do you like collecting items? Save up and start a general store. Like exploring? Start a delivery company that will send you to the furthest ends of the map. 

---

**Conflict**

There will probably come a time when you are involved in a conflict within Civcraft. Hopefully this will be a small issue

If someone commits a crime against you, they will work with you to capture the transgressor and bring them to justice (whether through repayment, prison time, or some other arrangement). If your government does not enforce laws, but instead allows citizens themselves to enforce justice, you can be advised as to what punishment is acceptable for the crime. 

It is important to note that some communities do not recognize a formal state, and not as a formally organized state. These users follow something called the Non Aggression Principle (NAP) and if you use force against them (the term force can be defined in different ways) they will exert their own justice. Sometimes they work together for this cause, which can create hard-to-define conflict however the best way to avoid this is to avoid aggression against these communities. 

It is wise to always communicate with your community leaders if crime has occurred. Witchhunts and vigilante justice can cause messy situations that are hard to solve without getting third parties involved. It is best to avoid those situations as they can stress international relations. 

---

**Citizen of the World**

Once you have established yourself, many people decide to explore more of Civcraft and establish homes in other cities. This is highly encouraged, but always check with the local laws regarding citizenship. Some nations require you to give up former affiliations before joining (those these are smaller in number, most communities welcome anyone). 

There *will* be a series of major roads that link the biggest communities. These will make it easy to travel

-Political &amp; Social Sciences

-English (which is rather a huge book club)

-Geography (which mainly focuses on mapping civcraft)

-Chemistry / Medicine

-Engineering / Ingame Mechanics (mainly redstone wiring)

No hat tricks, money, or both. With that in mind we have previously disallowed things like using the trap door glitch to access vaults as they defeated the primary purpose of Citadel with respect to PrisonPearl, today we are presented with a new style of vault construction that is also based on a rather simple trick that also defeats most of the purpose of PrisonPearl. 

While I tend to like encouraging cleverness in this case I am afraid I have to discourage it, although the details of its operation will be announced the day before in the changelog I do suggest going ahead and moving things out. 

As a note on confidentiality and methods of the current administration. The senior admins are the only ones with direct access to most information and what is known by the lower level admins is kept strictly controlled. TeaJizzle had been working with the group of players who had been attempting to free NJpalms by discovering the trick used to make the vault for the past two weeks at my encouragement. He has not seen the video sent to administration nor has the method been repeated to him, although not active or pivotal, they should be around and seem accessible, I do not want the joke of the Ivory Tower of Admin Crimes to become literal, if none of us play we risk becoming too detached from the community. TeaJizzle was doing his job working with the players and keeping me informed of their progress and the situation in general. While I would prefer to avoid such accusations I think that our system of information separation is effective at keeping administration aloof when it needs to be and close when it ought to be.

Both of these pearls were removed from Mount Augusta and have been taken to vaults. Augustan Law has not been followed in any way. 

You have consistantly said that the one thing - _the one thing_ - that you were absolutely going to do was to respect the legal processes of cities. This was a large part of your public justification for making war on the ""world police"" in the first place; they caught griefers and didn't submit them to Augustan justice. 

So I ask: will the pearls be returned to Augusta pending either a trial or an extradition hearing according to law?

We were all noobs at first trying to figure out how the server worked. Over time

Suffice to say

So inn the beginning there were two groups of us that originally joined CivCraft. There is the group that you called ""Baddies"" which consisted of players who had no longer played on that server for a long time and ""HCFactions"" or Gordge's group. At first it was just the Baddies that joined CivCraft and the original purpose was to wreak havoc because of a 3rd group ""MrTwiggys Group""

But that was because we failed to understand how the server worked at first. Afterwards

Yet you all still continued to spread propaganda about us. We did our best to repay our innocent victims and try to defend the ones not involved. After the breaking of foofeds vault

The war will continue but for different reasons now. We plan on fighting back against the admins for the unjust bans that were served after foofeds vault. I've talked to quite a few of you and you've talked to quite a few of us. We aren't savages out to grief the server

1368624940.0,1edqgr,[NEW USERS] Welcome to Civcraft Part One - The Basics,GuyThreepwood,49,4,20,"Ahoy there! 

So you're interested in joining us for Civcraft 2.0? Well, the second part is about the culture and advice on how to get involved in game. 

Note: See the sidebar for server addresses and other information!

---

**What is Civcraft?**

Officially, villages and cities spring up around the globe, each establishing their own laws and culture. And these laws actually matter, because there are no moderators besides the users themselves. 

---

**Self Moderation**

If a city forms and establishes wealth, criminals will be caught and sent to The End, which acts as a prison on Civcraft. They cannot escape until their captors release them or their friends steal the pearl from their captors and release them. 

So there is a way to punish criminals, doors and redstone constructions. So, if you reinforce an object, it would take several (currently 25-1,800 depending on the material) breaks before the block is actually destroyed. So, even if you use the cheapest reinforcements available, it would still take a minimum of 50 block breaks to open up a 2x1 hole to break into a house. 

---

**Realistic Map**

To help us achieve the simulation of society that we are aiming for

What this means is that there will be biomes you've never seen before, and landscapes more beautiful than any vanilla generation. The goal is to make travelling hard (the nether is disabled), but also to promote trade between cities. How will we promote trade though?

Well, so while it is normally very very hard to find diamond for example, you might find a city established on top of a diamond vein where they are very plentiful). 

---

**Other Features**

These are the basics that will help you get started playing Civcraft
 
- To create a market for XP trade
- To create a benefit for cooperating with society
- To monitor your home while you are away

The way I see it now

Really, and it's hard to really test the constraints without creative.


**RealisticBiomes combined with other mods will decrease the dependency on food and increase the dependency on beds**

With the advent of turning food into XP, food should be scarce due to other factors (diseased crops, lack of fertilization/hydration), especially not when death has little to no consequence (besides the minor inconvenience).

I don't know about everyone else, and will instead carry a bed kit with me. Enough food to get where I'm going, an inventory full of whatever I need, and enough materials to make an iron-reinforced double chest and an iron reinforced bed. Sleep in the bed, go about my business, deposit all my belongings in my chest. Starve, rinse, people will find ways around poorly-thought out mechanics.

**RealisticBiomes doesn't necessarily force people to work together** 

A world with RealisticBiomes would turn into Farm Simulator 2013. Cities would be empty because making a living in a city wouldn't be as profitable. People live in cities to build houses

**RealisticBiomes will probably increase lag on the server**

I remember in the early days of the server in my hometown, in fact. We filled an entire single chest with bread (not wheat) with a single harvest of all four towers. It brought the server to a crawl. For a while, it was funny, that our wheat tower held that much sway over the server tick. 

Point being, but I'm doubtful that farming is going to take server load in a positive direction from XP grinding (a solution we had largely fixed?).

**RealisticBiomes is just the XP grinding issue dressed up in a new costume**

Going back to the food = money trope, then going AFK and sitting in a minecart track. This will *increase* the amount of AFK botting.

I can already hear the server squealing from here.
 
**RealisticBiomes will punish casual players and serves as a massive buff for griefers/theives**

On the previous iteration of Civcraft, punishing casual players

If making food scarce wasn't bad enough, you can't effectively put farms underground with RealisticBiomes, so there's virtually no defense against farm griefing. Sure you can probably put a glass roof on your farm, but glass isn't a very reinforceable material.     


**Moving forward**

-RealisticBiomes is a fine idea

-Allow some sort of mechanic to ALLOW growing food in biomes you're not supposed to. Perhaps with some sort of material, to 'encourage' growth? Glowstone? Redstone Lamps? Don't know.

This is going to be the entire truth
_____________________________________

##1. Humble Beginnings
I joined this server some time around November of last year at the behest of some good friends from HCFactions

My first day was spent traveling thousands of blocks to reach their base of operations and get settled in. Once there I was geared by Bloo_Butterfly and I spent a fair bit of time decorating the base. When I started venturing outside of the base, sparking a dramatic stare-down. Yet I was left undisturbed to carry about my business. 

##2. The Vault

The next few weeks were fairly boring and mostly involved listening to Lego continuously be pearled in outnumbered fights. At this point I had caught word of *something* that TravisSupreme and others were working on, 2012. I was in mumble with TravisSupreme, Prerequisite, Russian_Roulette, Yakman and a few other people. It was decided that they would do ""the thing"" (the vault break) tonight, obviously well ahead of schedule and with far less numbers than previously anticipated. I was over ten thousand blocks away from Columbia at the time and had to go to my base to get armor and potions. By the time I got to Columbia, they were about 1-1.5 hours into the project, Gordge arrived at around 10 am EST. Around 11 am EST the first round of bans were issued. This ban was lifted in one hour following an apology from the administration. Travis and prereq were the two that were digging the entire time, leaving me, I DRO'd the vault in behind me and killed myself. 

##3. The Aftermath

We reveled in our success for a day before we were banned again for the use of xray or an equivalent client mod. Yakman decided it best to come clean and tell the public that he, *yet again*, unbanned following a post by ttk2, laying the fate of the case in the public's hands. The person to take up the case was Pheenixm who posted the original thread that started the case. The case was made for either side, and I still maintain that the use of World downloader was in no way against the rules as they existed at the time. That being said, ttk2 made the decision and issued bans to Ezziot, Yakman1, Prerequisite, entirely unaware of the use of world downloader. We were banned Christmas Day.

##4. First HCF War

This is the moment that I maintain that the First HCF War began

##5. Ace

I didn't immediately get on Ace613, I would accept it. This is not just."" Keep in mind that I did this without altering my IP, I did not use a VPN or any proxy service, I just simply logged on. My plan on Ace was to play the server as I would have on Ezziot, in a *moderately* peaceful manner. The first thing I did was found a city; Tux Hold. SoggyLettuce and I were the first people to establish Tux Hold, and soon grew it into a fairly nice city (almost entirely by my own hand). During this time I was asked to break into Foofed's vault (if you remember, the released pearls were repearled), AFK mining 6-7 layers of DRO, or the world border vault. The world border vault was owned and operated by Atrvmis (?) and Crashete

Back in Tux Hold, in fact, it was one of the first residences of NJPalms, at which point he had only owned minecraft for 1 week. 

The beginning of the end of my time on Ace began when I was hunting Mandy, yet there was one person in there who recognized my voice, Whosnick. He said ""Oh, Ezziot. I had a feeling you were still playing, you're Ace?"" To which I didn't respond. It became known that I was Ezziot be a growing number of people, and I was eventually banned along with numerous other alts of banned players. 

I should use this time to mention (though entirely out of order) the fact that during my time on Ace613 and into the time I was unbanned, Richard_T, and myself. He supplied all of the obsidian used to construct the black line and the vault as well as telling us information regarding the whereabouts of BHC/World Police.

##6. Redemption

I messaged Dredd at this point regarding my ban appeal. When asked wether I played on the server since Ezziot was banned I replied in a matter of fact manner

I was unbanned on March 16th and quickly rejoined Ryan at Bay City. I got a plot and built a nice house and discussed plans with Ryan for the future. This is around the time that IceeHipHop (Icee being prerequisite) was rampaging around killing all the Plams of the world and causing an all around ruckus across the server. Positronic aided in most of the kills that IceeHipHop made by supplying the coords to their bases, their plans, actions of admins in relation to their group. Without the help of Positronic, I don't think IceeHipHop would have been as much of a grievance as he was. I was obviously aware of who Icee was, and I fought along side him.

An anonymous source tipped us off (with proof) that Positronic had also acted against us in the past. It seemed that he belonged to neither side. He supplied information to us as well as to the World Police

It was at this point that I turned in IceeHipHop as prerequisite to garner some support with the administration (and avoid a possible ban if Posi revealed what he knew). I suppose I did it ""to save myself""

##7. The Beginning of the End

During the first vault raid I was pearled and placed in Foofed's world border vault. I wanted to pay reparations and told Posi to speak to Foofed about it (before we knew the truth about Posi) and he told me Foofed was going to ask for 8, I mined a massive diamond vein with clowny, an action that led to my banning. Needless to say, we had the resources necessary for a monstrous vault that could tower over every other in all of CivCraft. The vault is 46 layers to be precise and took an obscene amount of diamonds to build.

Then came RKWildCard's SECOND vault break. This is when I was questioned by Mr. Dredd. He asked me about Clowny123 and Aveelynn. I knew who both of these players were, I just said that she was described as a ""cunt"" by tehaleks. 

A couple of days ago I attacked Foofed in Tigerstaden, have since payed Foofed reparations and have been released from his vault on Ezziot. Honestly, I'm glad I decided to talk to him because he is far more reasonable than I have been led to believe by others. We had a casual, civil conversation and agreed to terms. Foofed released me before I even gave him coords to a drop chest, I could have just run off and not looked back, but I wanted to establish some sort of reconciliation between the two of us. All in all, I gave him 128d

Now here we are. Today. This afternoon I was banned from CivCraft on all of my accounts for associating with a banned player, and I don't regret ever associating with him. I will forever feel that our ban was unjust and undeserved. This situation could have been handled differently by all sides, yet it wasn't and now here we are. 

_____________________

The HCF War brought out the worst in everyone on this server. Three days ago I realized just how stressed this server made me, Ryanamidon and Tehaleks chief among them, and probably the only two people to be consistently nice to me. The people on this server had already driven Tehaleks off, and I'm left with no will to alt; it's not worth it. The drama was fun for awhile, but now it's *hateful*, I too have given into some of this hate and it isn't healthy. I shouldn't hate people over a video game, but I do. People on both sides are assholes, it's a farce. It was for the best that I was banned. Perhaps I can return to a regular sleep schedule and a more happy attitude.

I'm sorry to everyone I've lied to. I tried to be nice to most everyone I met, it was not. Maybe CivCraft will be a better place without me. I don't think much will change without me around, the ignorant will stay ignorant, and the children will remain children. Best of luck. If you have any questions, feel free to ask (that goes for you too, admins).

It has become clear that this was a futile hope

First and foremost we need to retool our mods with more administrative powers and PEX support. All of our current tools have been designed with the idea of being operated primarily from the terminal

Once we have the ability to bring people in granularly we are going to need to make use of that. I would like to draft current or former Civcraft programmers

The most significant implications of this are as follows, but otherwise the Judge may take the initiative in investigations.  

On the subject of the condition of the new admins status as players, as it is important that we remain able to obtain input about the game and interact with it ourselves instead of being entirely removed from it, we intended the ivory tower of admin crimes to be figurative, not literal. That being said, clear abuse of administrative knowledge will not be taken lightly and will be grounds for stripping of rank, or if blatant enough, banning from the server. These punishments will be lead by the Grand Hall Of Justice

I apologize if the administration has seemed slow or apathetic on the issues at hand. We are all busy with our lives as students as well as the projects coming up for Civcraft

[Recommended listening](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbwlGv9SWfY)

*A/N: Forgive the artistic license taken in regards to events. All characters and events in this story–even those based on real people–are entirely fictional. All celebrity players are impersonated.....poorly.*

'Twas a pleasant evening in the fair city of Mt Augusta. Communists frolicked and played in the dying light of the sun, labored upon unclaimed corners constructing their very own houses, under the benevolent and merciful gaze of the God and esteemed leader of the global proletariat, Zombie_Lenin.  The ever-watchful town militia guardd the massive vault, keeping those who would disturb this peace in  almost inescapable confinement, and reminding all would-be griefers of the prospect of spending ~~eternity~~ the time it takes for government bureaucracy to process their trial wandering the bleak wasteland of the end with all the other dammed souls. 

Many of the city's more cynical residents had warned in the past that this safety enjoyed by everyone within Mt Augusta's walls rested precariously upon the ability of the world police to catch criminals

Like all great storms the signs of its coming were few and far between. A broken chest here

Then it happened. 

A citizen

""Didn't you hear? MrTwiggy killed a noob outside Ataraxia!""

""Someone pearled Foofed outside Aristopolis!""

""I heard from someone who heard from someone that Twiglet raped Tactful in his Prussian sex dungeon!""

Ever the level-headed public servant, Augusta could have a full-fledged riot on its hands. With that in mind he began banging together various kitchen utensils in the hope of attracting the attention of the mob, and to his surprise eventually managed to garner the attention of all but a loud-mouthed few. He then coughed, and climbed upon the nether portal to address the rabble.

""Friends, I bring myself before thee to shed the light of truth upon the various accounts of what happened around half an hour ago, and hopefully reassure the community in the process. A heinous crime has been perpetrated this night, the likes of which have not occurred in Augusta for over a hundred years. Blood was spilt upon Augustan soil. 

""But do not panic dear friends, and as we speak the denizens of the Batcave rally their best bounty hunter sin order bring this coward to justice. It is with a heavy heart I must ask something of you- remain vigilant, Augustans. Although I can guarantee that no further deaths will occur tonight, we must all do our part to ensure such a tragedy does not happen again. Keep this in mind as you return home, but rest easy with the knowledge that you still reside in the safest and most popular city within civcraft. Thank you for your patience and cooperation on this matter.""

Sighing with relief the mayor turned to Csimplify as the crowd dispersed. Making sure he was not overheard

""Take me to the body.""

They found Ron_Paul_2012 and several other prominent members of the city government awaiting their arrival, Sami raised his eyes to a spot halfway up the wall upon which two words were inscribed, painted bold in the blood of the recently deceased. What it entailed struck fear into the hearts of all present.

**NO REPERATIONS**

""You don't think-""

Mr Ghani's inquiry was cut short by thecriminalmind.

""Yes. It was him. MrTwiggy was not acting alone."" Fear was evident in his voice

Suddenly a rumbling was heard emerging from the other side of the city

""Earthquake?!""

Ron Paul shook his head and laughed bitterly.

""Fool! Was it not prophesied that this day would come? You only had to listen. You could have stopped this!""

As if shaken from a trance by Ron's harsh words

""Huh? what's happening?""

[""It's happening.""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYD46Q0a3Qo)

A window smashed. A woman screamed. But one sound stood out above all. A guttural war cry

**""GORDGE SMASH!""**

*A/N: Congrats on making it this far. I apologize to anyone even vaguely offended by their depiction in this tale

&gt;* Fixed random issues brought up over the last week or so with biome tags and what not.
&gt;* Biomes are MUCH larger
&gt;* Added lots of rivers
&gt;* Nether biomes are now smaller islands scattered through the ocean instead of on the main continents
&gt;* Added Quartz ore to the entire map

* We have a build of RealisitcBimoes that provides for persistent crop growth, will not work out very well in a production environment. With this in mind we are trying to move it over to async queries like JukeAlert, but it seems database optimization is the current primary bottleneck of the development team, we need an example implementation of optimized table setups and async query systems. 

* RiotCraft is now online

* MineLibrary, I am currently unopposed and waiting on a .jar.

* On the subject of alts, those whom I trust enough to give SSH rarely know how to use it, those who know SSH are delegated to programming most of the time anyways to make best use of human resources. For it to be feasible to delegate the alts list system would need to be merged into prisonpearl (no external script) and then have in game commands to handle exclusions and figuring out who is associated with who so that anyone who can log into Minecraft and be given the right permissions can help out in those situations. Further action on alts can not even be considered until this is done.

* JukeAlert is the only launch essential I item that I do not have any sort of build for, or otherwise. Since its very much important to get it tested I would like to have one as soon as possible. At the same time I understand significant development work is going into Citadel as well to prepare the system to run on the same group system. 

* Updated Humbug

* FactoryMod has been updated with some improvements to xp bottling from crops as well as other minor changes.

* We are still in need of a stripped down build of Bottle0 I think there is a project bottle0 lite that fits out needs but until I get a .jar I am left somewhat hanging. 

* there is already a bukkit 1.5.2 recommended build out and other than the usual dozen or so dupe bugs at this stage it seems to be working pretty well. It may be worth it to go ahead and move on up to 1.5.2 as they will be on a recommended build pretty quickly. Can anyone comment on what plugins would need to be recompiled and such? 


* In a somewhat embarrassing mistake I forgot that I needed to restart Civtest once per day to get pearl feeding working properly

I have now added a system that makes it so you can obtain glorious bragging rights on top of blood money. Remember

* Check for their name on [CivBounty](http://www.civbounty.com) with the new search feature. (Their name will autocomplete if they have active reports).
* On their reports page
* Click 'post claims thread' to create a thread on Reddit / Even PM Author's of reports by clicking on their name.
* When people close their reports they will be asked to reward you with points
* ?????
* Profit

*But DecoyDrone ?! The person I just caught wasn't on CivBounty. What do I do?*

Tell people to use CivBounty of course! Help me spread the word. Let them know that they can put that wall of text on CivBounty and post to Reddit with just a few more clicks.

**Bounty Hunter Features**

So right now this is the bare minimum sketch of what I have planned. In the future the leader board will have different factors weighting in other than just rewarded points. For instance

**Other planned features** (please add on to these in comments below!):

* Minecraft user names / mugshots like perps on front page list
* Hunter stat pages 
* Public access to where rewards came from (since this reward system is a little based on honor
* Email alerts?
* More automation around announcing captures

##All users of CivBounty##

**Spread the word**

With the new search function you can very easily do a background check on someone you don't know. If they have active records against them

The search is only as useful as the quality/quantity of reports in the database. So please make sure everyone knows they can use CivBounty. It is very easy to post a report to Reddit once it is created (might make this a one click thing if people want it). And even if you don't have diamonds to pay a bounty hunter you can now reward them with leader board points.

I have been suggesting people post to CivBounty when I see a crime report thread. If you see one that I miss

Hey everyone. At the moment, how they work, and their purpose/benefits.

Here is a short video demonstrating some of the plugin features:

[Demo Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNX-ZEiCleM)

**Yellow Flower:** The yellow flower is used as an 'upgrade tool'. With it, and when you left click on it with the yellow flower, it will upgrade/create.

**Red Rose:** The red rose is used as an 'activation tool'. By left clicking on an Ore Gin, it must have enough fuel for one 'mining operation'. One mining operation is essentially mining the dimensions of the Ore Gin 1 block forward, whether it be a 1x1 tunnel, or an 11x11 tunnel. If an Ore Gin runs out of fuel while mining, it will automatically power off.

**Iron Shovel / The Wrench:** The iron shovel is used as a 'repair tool'. By left clicking on a broken Ore Gin, it will break down and won't be usable until it is repaired.

**Placing/Destroying An Ore Gin:** In order to destroy an Ore Gin

Name: T(L) OreGin

Lore: Status: (STATUS) ( (BLOCK BREAKS) )

Where (L) is the tier level of the Ore Gin

**Retrieving Valuables:** Certain tiers of Ore Gins have special features that make it more beneficial to the owner. One example of this is the 'Retrieve Valuables' feature that certain higher level Ore Gins possess. If the Ore Gin has this, it will drop the blocks beside the Ore Gin. (Note: I've toyed with the possibility of allowing players to place chests beside the Ore Gin, in which items will automatically be placed if the OreGin inventory is full.)

**Citadel:** If an Ore Gin comes across a reinforced block

**Tier Properties:** Every tier of Ore Gin has it's own respective mining properties. This includes such things as the mining time (how many ticks between each mining operation), the repair cost, the mining distance (how far the Ore Gin will reach before it shuts off), whether it will 'retrieve valuables', the dimensions of it's mining operations, and a few more. At the moment, all of these are very rough estimations of what might be balanced. All balance testing/thoughts are very much appreciated. The current tier properties can be found here:

But first things first

**list removed due to privacy issues

----

As for their now famously controversial actions they remain as they stand until the new policies I am about to outline are used to resolve the issue. 

First comes an administration prime directive of sorts, and expand game mechanics that allow the creation of player societies in Minecraft. For example when a player is being pearled the game mechanic is in place, and operating correctly, there are no grounds for admin intervention unless it can be shown that the mechanic is not working correctly. 

With that in mind I would like to expand the adversarial system we have previously used in cheating accusations against players into administrative issues of the manner presented to us now. The idea and method is relativity simple those proposing admin action must present their arguments that the situation violates the prime directive and should be corrected. For example ""Foofed could not have reasonably predicted the flaw in his vault and how it would be exploited without using x-ray and being more familiar than is reasonable with constantly changing minecraft player physics

Those are of course only examples and far from the only arguments that can be made

In situations where changes are too rapid or to great to be reversed once a decision is reached a party must file for an injunction with a post to the subreddit showing reasonable cause for the admin prime directive being violated. If there exists cause admins wait a reasonable amount of time for a situation to reach a stable point where outcomes are relatively clear and stop the situation from moving forward until a conclusion had been reached.

For example if an injunction where filed in the situation at hand we would have waited til the vault was fully cracked


Its the concept of injunctions that demonstrate the trade offs in this system, third there will be many small things that retroactive action does not cover nearly so well. But the ability to solve problems over time in an organized, public, and conclusive manner. 


-----

Two more points I could not seem to fit in there 

* arguments in public court are accepted as truth in good faith

* Admins reach a conclusion based on the arguments presented

Keep in mind it is subject to change. The only entry requirement is agreeing to the Contract of Neighborly Understanding below.

Principles of Metropolis:

**Understanding:**

The Metropolis is managed

Contract of Neighborly Understanding

- Do not expand past your predefined borders into other parts of The Metropolis
- Problems with other cities of Metropolis should be handled first internally (with other Metropolis members)
- Do not harbor griefers
- Respect the other citizens of Metropolis
- Conflicts with citizens are to be handled without violence if at all possible. Violence and detainment is to be reserved for when there is an immediate threat to people or property
- Do not recruit from another city in Metropolis without permission from the affected cities government/leader. 
- Land between cities are mutually owned by everyone. They can be used for herds, and small outposts. Do not exert sovereignty over these lands. It is encouraged to work with your neighbor on use of lands between you and them.

**Mutual Defense**

Although all cities are allowed to have their own Armies and ways of going about defence

One such example will be Exercitus. It was established by lem0nland91111 and will accept members from any of the cities of The Metropolis, if you are are interested in helping me with Exercitus, Lemonland91111 can send you the outline. The outline lays out ranks along with the powers and privileges granted depending on participant's ranks.

**Creative Expression**

The entire reason The Metropolis is not a single monolithic city under a government, we maximize mutual defense and trade while also maximizing freedom to build civilizations.

**Respect**

“Have fun

It is harsh trying to strike a balance between fairness and effectiveness, to be frank at the start there I knew way too little to hold the job and I ended up making some decisions which I do regret and have since taken steps to correct. By the end there I lived in fear of someone cheating in any way big enough for me to have to deal with it, I would ignore things more often than I would take action simply because it had long ago become too much for me to handle on my own. 

People are passionate about this game, as if trying to deal with Minecraft and whatever scraps of evidence it can provide is not bad enough the hard battle has to be fought uphill against well meaning but often uninformed or sometimes malicious community opinion. The only sorts of systems that can survive not being manipulated by the community are exactly the types that the community will least accept. 

This leaves us at a wonderful catch 22 the more checks and balances a system has the less effective it becomes

I get the wonderful burden of striking the balance between that we can hopefully all live with. 

The proposed system is as follows, one to second, and a third to review the action at a later date. By virtue of being a moderately sized team the need for a second on the action should serve as a check without making it impossible to act quickly in some situations. The need for a third gives a dedicated period to review of past actions in retrospect and a chance for a final check. 

The initial proposed members of this team are Hpoom, and if he cares to join us samighandi 

Obviously once on this team the people in question can not play at the very least until the next map reset if they are to ever be allowed to play again. I would hope to continue to expand this team with more varied and respected members from the community as they volunteer or are asked to join. 

---------

Finally I need to address some concerns about the Chief Justice, but I do stand by him as a genuinely good person and administrator that cares about this server and the people on it. After all if I only stood by those who were flawless I would quickly find myself standing alone. 

If he is to blame for TeaJizzle’s abuse then I am just as much to blame for not keeping careful tabs on his actions myself. But as I have said before we have not allowed ourselves the luxury of enough personnel to review each other before. But I feel that now is the time to start with the system outlined above. I hope we can all have the maturity to understand that Dredd revealing relevant information to an ongoing investigation in confidence with an assistant does not make him responsible when and if that assistant is to betray his confidence as an assistant administrator.

- MANY stacks of potion materials

Aristopolis treasury losses:
- 3 stacks of iron blocks
- 40d

My best guess is that there was at least ~~350d~~ 450d worth of damages between the 2 vaults.

1361161279.0,18qd5v,A full account from Gondolin of the battle in Aristopolis,WildWeazel,52,10,153,"A full account of the recent battle dubbed the ""Valentine Massacre"" between Gondolin and Zombie Lenin's posse (for lack of a better term) has not yet been presented to the public. I would like to tell that story, in part because the fortuitous resolution made it less urgent. I've probably forgotten or muddled a few details

If you're reading these sorts of threads, much to the chagrin of Leningrad's hegemony. As soon as this situation settled down, we started hearing reports from Zombie Lenin of an Aristopolitan griefing Buenos Aires. The account in question has never been affiliated with us and we have no idea who it is. Again, hostilities were avoided.

**tl;dr check-in: Prior but unrelated tensions between Leningrad and Gondolin.**

Meanwhile, babycham, and dethfly9 arrived in Aristopolis and requested residence in the city. A citizen, having been given permission from city leaders to do so, offered them a free plot of land, according to the council policy for new residents. The plot was an improved area in a neighborhood on the north side of town, on the main east-west highway within the clearly developed boundaries of Aristopolis. It had been cleared and leveled, and plastered it with satirical signs referencing Gondolin, Nondolin

The next day a citizen asked me and some councilors to see something, a Queen, and other elements of an independent state. The councilors were concerned by this, but I asked them not to take action, reminding them that immelol &amp; company were notorious trolls. At this point, while distasteful, nothing had been done that warranted legal response.

**tl;dr check-in: New residents use their plot to mock us and other server memes. Nothing happens.**

(edit: I had incorrectly placed this incident between visits. See Silianat's comment below for clarification.)
On the day in question, even going so far as to travel up there and hit him, but he would not go. After some time the crew decided to leave Theodius to his griefing, but then Zombie Lenin arrived with a group in tow so they returned through the portal to Aristopolis.

Unaware of any of this, citing trespassing. I asked ZL about the nature of the visit, but his company returned through the portal.

Around this time Berge arrived and took charge of the conversation. Soon the entourage reappeared on the ""Ondolin"" lot, which continued for the next hour or so. Berge repeatedly insisted that Zombie Lenin leave, and refused to acknowledge the existence of Ondolin as anything other than a private residence.

**tl;dr check-in: ZL and friends show up for unannounced ""diplomatic visit""

While this was going on, Dethfly (one of the residents) remained behind. Berge demanded that he too leave, and when he refused pearled him briefly to take him into the nether. Around the same time ZL somehow fell to his death in the nether near our portals, possibly into the hole that Silianat had dug while fleeing from igotyou. Gondolin escorts witnessed it, expressed their disbelief, and grabbed his dropped gear. They returned to Aristopolis and stowed the items, then addressed the matter now at hand: what to do about the property known as Ondolin.

During this part I was FIOSed for about 20 minutes. I came back to find that the decision was to reclaim the property and remove the structure. It was completely dismantled and returned to the state at which ownership was granted to the residents. During and following the operation arguments continued on Mumble, apparently neither upset or very surprised that the castle had been removed. Berge sent him away too, and he left without argument.

**tl;dr check-in: ZL falls to his death

Now Aristopolis was back to normal, along with insisting on Ondolin's legitimacy. At first Berge refused on the grounds that ZL dropped the items on our land while tresspassing, but eventually he decided that we would give the gear back but make no other concessions. However, ZL returned with a larger, heavily armed group before it was settled.

This time

* ZombieLenin
* Kempje
* NJPalms
* Theodius
* igotyou
* StarkBastard
* Konartist
* SerQwaez
* ividito
* Milzed
* pucker678
* Makanla

**tl;dr check-in: Things get heated; we are willing to return the lost gear but ZL returns and marches into the city with an assorted force to make demands of us.**

The group made their way through the private portal into the north side of the city, but it was becoming clear that violence was imminent. Some citizens reported the group breaking into houses on the way to Berge's tower. Aristopolitans, anticipating combat, either logged out or grouped up in the town square. Berge switched over to his alt to avoid giving the enemy an objective to rally around. I stood on the ramparts of the tower to observe, unable to engage in direct PvP due to my poor connection. After a few tense minutes, Theodius hit me with an arrow and open combat immediately broke out.

The battle raged on for quite a while, admitting defeat. Those of our opponents who were pearled, including Zombie Lenin, were freed as our own fighters were killed before they could secure the pearls. Following the battle, our prisoners' pearls were placed in vaults, and we were told that they would be freed in exchange for Berge's own pearl. Berge and some of the prisoners themselves rejected this offer. Our people immediately began planning to free the pearls until, unexpectedly

**tl;dr check-in: After some posturing ZL's force initiates combat. The situation descends into chaos and many are killed/pearled. Prisoners are held for ransom of Berge's pearl.**

I won't relate the fallout of this situation and its resolution here since it unfolded more publicly here on reddit. All of our people have been freed, Aristopolis and Buenos Aires both seem to be recovering well. I hope that my report cleared up and unanswered questions, and that this rather absurd conflict can be put behind us.

**Editorialized TL;DR: Zombie Lenin has been itching for a fight for weeks and after a few failed attempts to incite our aggression, and others. The situation that was ultimately brought to armed conflict was a farcical secession claim of a city plot built in mockery of Gondolin. No combatants are currently being held as prisoners on either side.**

1354918584.0,14guay,On the banning of RattlerTank,ttk2,55,14,106,"First of all I would like to apologize for creating yet another thread on this issue

As for your complaint about not being presented with all the evidence against you that is because Exultant, I myself was busy for most of today with the intent of responding in detail to your question after my final for the day. I am sorry for the delay, but coming to the conclusion that we are refusing you evidence after we don't respond for just 3 hours and resorting to public attack is unjustified. 

Now

So what then is the most dangerous type of cheating? What distorts the game world most? 

To most people, duping, invulnerability, or the famous god books incident. Yet historically those have been very unsuccessful. I mean going down the list, the last flyhacker was banned in 30 minutes, the last duper less than 24 hours, the last fastbreak 0 minutes (it was stopped and reversed in progress)

And for all of these incidents it was easy to track, and understand the results. Almost counterintuitively it is the most powerful hacks that are the weakest at actually affecting the server game world in persistent manner. 

If it is not the most powerful hacks that represent the most danger to the game world

The answer is subtlety itself. The hacks that are the most dangerous are not the ones that let a player break a block instantly, but the ones that let them run just one step ahead of anyone else. 


When you give an already good player just that little bit extra the game changes, potion, or block break ahead of everyone else makes a good player into a legendary player. Gives them the power to shape the game world illegitimately without anyone ever noticing. With the patience and skill to wield them the small hacks make all the difference in the world. 

The story as I know it goes like this

A rousing underdog story, never faltering and avoiding the one imperfection in action that would be fatal.  

RattlerTank is asking us to show him the smoking gun

Is what RattlerTank did last night impossible? I don't know


So then what should our decision be? If we are right then we have saved the server from the most insidious type of cheating

Every one of the involved admins is very much on the fence about this issue and we are still working on talking it out

Many of you may remember an issue very similar to this one, just a series of nigh impossible escapades. Even with the 20/20 vision provided by hindsight the grey area there refuses to resolve into black and white. 

As with that situation

Its with this in mind that I motion the other admins for the release of Rattler followed by close observation into the future.

So after much consideration, as the official banker/meth lab overseer of the Jacks, I decided to move the diamonds/pearls from the vault. This individual was too much of a liability, and clearly had some form of endgame, the goals of which $20 had been put towards to register a minecraft account. I'm not sure what his plan was, but either way, I did not wish to risk it.

As I was doing this, lost over 400 diamonds, 15 stacks of experience, high level enchanted armour and weapons sets, and 200 iron blocks, by leaving it in a chest in the open of the LAFLs area (Large Area of Flat Land) that he had made as some kind of secondary hold, putting strain on the resources for the main hold and using every piece of fuel we could acquire, development of which has been at a standstill.

Alexzandria also expressed frustration in the hold's build, and how the whole pearling of the Nazi thing was just getting ridiculous, and how the whole thing seemed to be falling apart. She said that the Nazis should be released, and we discussed disbanding The Jacks. 

I'd already gotten to work getting the diamonds out, every diamond in that Hold, and pearl, may be compromised, as myself being the Jack of Diamonds, if someone was sleepy/didn't look to carefully, this guy could do anything.

So I removed the diamonds, I considered what Alexzandria had said, about how one of the leaders had just wasted over a tenth of our wealth, how we were discussing the way the Jacks had deviated from that initial Nine meeting where we had discussed no permenant imprisonment, and how we had become an organization so far from it's roots. 

So, and safe. By my calculations, the three main contributors to this amount are Skywalker, Sigbjorn and myself, though many of the other Jacks have helped out. My current thoughts are to privately split these diamonds with those who have contributed, via dead drop points I would PM the co-ordinates to, on the conditions that they are not used to fund yet another permanent imprisonment war effort.

Due to my speed of accessing the vault, however she impeded me from freeing the griefers captured by the Jacks- as some of these are also being held for excessive periods of time, and have mostly quit the server.

At present, with zero casualties. A large sum of these diamonds liberated will also be paid to those who have been wronged by the Jacks.

In the words of Noxy, Kinetic... but I'm disappointed in you.""

It is just a game, filled with the urge to make a really fun war on this server. It was going to be a great skirmish, we had so much fun... and then you reduced us to a culling in the night, and blowing a beautiful city to ruins. You didn't just pearl them, you stopped dozens of people playing at all, ruining a wonderful facet of civcraft before it started. You then stated that it was done more because of the military threat of 30 people working together so quickly, an ulterior motive which so many loyal Jacks members were blind to. You didn't do it because it was the ""right thing to do"", and you know it as well as the rest of us now do.

We could have had so much fun. You said that I destroyed three months of hard work? There hasn't been a block placed in that fortress since the Prussians were pearled

To those griefers/others pearled by Jacks I did not free, and I can only hope that as the Jacks continue to disband, you will given the freedom you deserve.

1375881756.0,1jvqly,[FactoryMod Proposal] Drama Factory (Already coded!),landrypants,50,12,64,"###The Problem


A significant component that I see missing from CivCraft is that there is no competition for limited economic resources. There are rarely situations where there is zerosum competition over harvesting resources in game. This is opposed to the real world where resources such as fish populations

###The Solution

To this end I have coded a slightly different kind of factory into FactoryMod and would like peoples opinions on it.

The Drama Factory, such that the first factory may produce 100 XP bottles, but once 5 of those factories are constructed each will only produce 20 XP bottles, destroying a factory removes it from this count. To further increase the interaction between factory owners, each factory will report the locations of all other factories of that type. It is my hope that these mechanics will impose interesting problems for the entire population to address, since it introduces resources over which it is hard to claim ownership, however the greatest profit from these resources will be gained when there is the least amount of conflict. Really I just want to see some kick ass resource based drama.

###The Details

I have structed the economics of the first rendition of this type of factory differently than past factories. For an intial test I would like to focus on a factory that can generate XP for free. The initial cost of the factory will be 10 stacks of XP, since this is a Drama Factory, the 7 stacks is a global output, so if 7 factories exist in the world, each will only be able to produce 1 stack each week.

I have structured this factory differently since its purpose is different than currently implemented factories. It exists to place multiple groups of people in conflict over a limited resource. For example, as opposed to having the ability to quickly build a factory, take advantage of it and then not care as much if someone comes and destroys it; higher repair costs also motivate protection of ones factories. I have removed input and fuel costs since I think the higher repair costs serve a similiar role, since these factories are likely to be in constant use, and including inputs and fuel simply complicates the design and demphasizes the cost of fixing a factory someone else has destroyed. Lastly, I do not believe free resource generation will lead to inflationary issues since there is an absolute limited global production amount, preventing exponential resource gain.
 

###Your Input

I would love to hear peoples input on the overall proposal, and scaling of the suggested numbers. Particularily when it comes to scaling things I think my numbers may be a bit off.

-------

------

* This time I double and triple checked that the chunks in question are fixed and I am very sure they are. Furthermore we think we have identified the source of our problem in NCP and we think we have disabled it. So

* Please report any issues you have right away so that I can track down anything I forgot while getting this setup configured correctly again or maybe something simply lost in transit

* Updated Factorymod


* Updated Dyncap to a new version

* I tried messing with the nocheat settings to get the block reappearing thing to go away

* As I have discussed in previous change logs it seems that software optimization goes a lot further than hardware optimization when it comes to what we are doing. This begs the question of if it is a better investment to rent better hardware or put that same money towards development of optimizations. [Intreppid](https://www.intreppid.com/whmcs/cart.php?a=confproduct&amp;i=0) seems reasonable, and Stammius charges an arm and a leg for DDOS protection so it makes me kinda suspicious. 


* Decreased hostile mob spawn cap from 20 to 15 per chunk. 

* consider adding easier ways to acquire ender pearls when spawn rates are heavily nerfed. 

* Downgraded RealisticBiomes to initial version from the 19th.

* We need JukeAlert SQL batching and indexing as well as a entry limit. 

* RealisticBiomes needs to use a real sql db with batching and indexing as well. 


* How are the plugins working for everyone? Any problems to report or feature requests to make? 



* I would like to thank all of you

As some of you may have read in the daily update

**Some info about the map:**   

-The ore is currently set at 25% of vanilla except diamonds which are 5%   
-
-I forgot to remove emeralds in this latest iteration because it was 5am and I was tired. Act as if they aren't there because they are simple to remove.  
- 
-I introduced a much tamer version that I had initially prepared after seeing how many people preferred vanilla terrain. I hope to try to cater to both interests by providing and interesting terrain while still keeping it calm mountain wise.  
-
-Flat bedrock as requested by admins to avoid future vault issues
-   

-Currently using 18 custom biomes along with the 22 basic biomes   
-
-I have 92 biomes downloaded on my computer but some are far from traditional terrain that some players may not like. I could always turn the rarity on these WAY down so that they could be sort of ""wonders of the world"" 
-

**Issues I have been told about:**    

-Random wool blocks on the mountain
-


**EDIT, although it is fun to explore with no knowledge of what you will find. I have already described the ore distribution above and veins could be added by admins at a later date. There is literally nothing I could do here to alter this. It is a plugin anyone can download and run. All I did was alter config files.

1366649862.0,1cvfd9,Only YOU can stop downvoting!,ariehkovler,80,36,63,"For most of its existence

As in many things, created their reddit accounts for Civcraft. 

Downvoting is extremely common here. There are a couple of reasons for this.

1. It's called 'voting'

Reddit itself has a different assumption; the system considers a vote as an expression of the _appropriateness_ of a post or comment. Because of this

2. While the subreddit was much less moderated

Throughout the original HCF invasion I routinely upvoted posts from HCF members making threats or demands. I did this for two reasons. First, meaning most people never saw them. That's a problem for everyone, including those people who were fighting them. 

We've recently moved to a more active form of moderation. Jokes and memes can go to [civchan](http://Chan.civcraft.vg) instead. 

So two pleas:

The first plea is to stop downvoting posts and comments that contain content. If you disagree with a post, is problematic because they can disappear without a trace. People with unpopular views shouldn't be censored by a tyranny of the majority either. 

The second plea is necessary because obviously some people won't really listen to the first plea. It's to the few hundred daily readers:

Upvote more! Upvote posts especially that contain useful, important or unpopular content. It's rare for a useful post to get more than 20 downvotes. You can help maintain a good level of debate by upvoting those posts and comments that keep a conversation moving. If you _must_ downvote, save it for unfunny jokes and memes and useless messages that only say things like ""qq"".

If everyone gets into this habit then we can all stop seeing the number of votes as a measure of popularity but rather of relevance. Hopefully this will make the subreddit more useful for everyone.",self,t5_2tm1t,False,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cvfd9/only_you_can_stop_downvoting/

However lets get too it.

You've probably heard of FactoryMod

Step 1:

Aqquire a crafting table

Step 2:

Place the blocks like [this](http://i.imgur.com/6FCK8Mn.png) (the furnace and chest's location can be swapped

Step 3:

Insert the factory ""build recipe"" into the chest

Step 4:

Left click the crafting table with a stone spade

Step 5:

You now have a factory! Hurray! Now how can you use it you might ask? Well I'll tell you how! Simply left click the crafting table with a stone spade

Step 6:

Once you've found the desired recipe, the factory will then tell you [what that recipe needs.](http://i.imgur.com/aTDfioN.png)

Step 7:

Once you've inserted both coal and the recipe's [required materials](http://i.imgur.com/RzfzXtB.png). Simply left click the furnace(you guessed it

Step 8:

Wait

Step 9:

??? PROFIT! After the factory is done

Now in case you did not catch it in the first paragraph, i hope that manintime will have the config.yml done for civtest, and then I'll try to get a write up of the tech tree done(unless of course he's nice enough to do that).

My storeroom's walls are 2-3 blocks thick to prevent pearling through

Ancrapz entered the snitch field

The obsidian wall itself gave no clues that this part of the wall was 1 block thick as the surrounding obsidian was lined up with it. All of the obsidian was reinforced with the same material. 

The building also has a layer of obsidian that extends 20-30 blocks out from the storeroom, and then proceeded to dig straight to the one block thick wall.

And he did this all in less than 2 minutes.

The storeroom's dimensions are roughly 20x30 blocks

If this break-in took more than two minutes I could see a defense. If you break a reinforced block it shows the one behind it. However

Right before he broke into my store room he was on the other end of town breaking chests. 

**Pretty pictures:**

* [One block thick wall point](http://i.imgur.com/tZTSJmR.png). I had dug the obsidian out a bit more to figure out what Ancrapz had done

* [The one block removed revealing chest behind it.](http://i.imgur.com/5AOqqkb.png) You can pearl through a 1 block thick wall with a chest because it's considered an entity not a block.

* [Diagram marking out how thick the wall is.](http://i.imgur.com/0lTbOGV.png) The blocks highlighted in green show the obsidian that's aligned with it. There is no visible indication from the outside that this point in the wall is one thick.

* [Looking down from the same point](http://i.imgur.com/YH3RcjQ.png) Red line shows his tunnel.

* [First Entrance into snitch field on East end of Store Room at 8:26 AM](http://i.imgur.com/Gw4NJkE.png) Doesn't break any obsidian.

Total time: 22 minutes.

Additional information:

Ancrapz has been breaking into houses in my town for months managing to find hidden chests and vaults.

[He found a temporary vault just built by another town member and dug straight down into it.](http://i.imgur.com/XGOGsTE.png) This vault was located away from any building and not lit.

[He then escaped by digging straight down into the floor of the vault to a natural cave system.](http://i.imgur.com/ub8mSx8.png)

[He didn't use torches](http://i.imgur.com/FnUrcoc.png)

[The cave connected to a 2x1 tunnel he dug](http://i.imgur.com/lHbhM0E.png). Torches were there from previous exploration.

[Leading right to a mineshaft ladder to the surface](http://i.imgur.com/lBjL4q4.png) http://i.imgur.com/20kgcN6.png

1359731240.0,17p2vq,Pearling cost discussion part II: The resurrection ,ttk2,49,6,179,"Right now due to life in general I have very little free time and most of that is spent directing projects for and around Civcraft by email and other means. As such I think it would be best to spread the discussion about Pearling mechanics over a few threads and a few days so that I can respond in proper fashion to what I glean from the previous thread. With that in mind lets launch right into the discussion. 

On of the primary objections I noticed was that there needed to be a real death mechanic, ideally such things would be split so that we could make prisonpearl a more realistic prison mechanic with interfering with the death portion of its functionality. But the problem with that is apparent, mainly that the minute such a death mechanic exists it will become the ultimate goal of all fights, even when it really should not be. This is both an effect of the people involved (which I have no issue with) and the fact that Civcraft is a videogame, and game mentality will make it a given in any situation that the death mechanic is the goal. 

In short no one would use prisonpearl because why imprison when you can kill? 

Edit: I should not that I am not addressing non-stackable items a fuel and/or any cost *above* 8 coal pear day because I want there to still be a 'death' mechanic in that you can keep someone pearled forever without looking at them, just not a ton of people. 

Onto the cost mechanic, costly stackable food would be better, but not something that encourages more and more farming, so fish essentially is the only renewable cost worth discussing. 

I am fully open to decreasing the fuel requirements, Batman can defeat all the criminals he wants but its the police that have to sweep in and clean up after him. 

For an organized city or group it should be no problem at all collecting enough in taxes, to fund however many prisoners you have (within reason) if this is not true then the value does need to be lowered, but no matter what large numbers of pearls will scale even a truly trivial cost into astronomical levels, this is the point of the mechanic. 

If you are opposed to mechanics that require taxation or organization then you fail to understand the challenge that Civcraft presents, *can you really organize? really create a leadership, fund efforts, build a true nation or society that solves not just the easy problems like ""Whoo we wrote a Constitution!"" but the hard ones.* ",,False,self,1359753172.0,t3_17p2vq

I explicitly give all admins, if this starts happening again yell at them so that we can avoid the loss of more data. 

I would like to take the time to remind everyone that this entire server is officially still in the beta testing phase for the next week

* The testing server is now updated to 1.5.2

* [JukeAlert](https://github.com/erocs/JukeAlert) finally got the start of its Async changes and with some fixes should be able to get a working build pretty quickly. 

* With that in mind I am going to try and setup a deadline

* To note the distinction, testing servers are there to make sure things don't explode, Civtests are to actually test things like social impacts and changes. 

* Exactly how plentiful are spawners at the moment? As far as I am aware they are at 1/4th or 1/6th vanilla levels

 
* Apparently [this mod](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/firstjoinplus/) would allow us to spawn a book in the inventory of everyone who joined

Its filled with the same bullshit

You think anyone wants to hear about your fucking pleas the the public about your unjust bannings?

Fuck no.

What the fuck do you think its going to accomplish?

Oh man

Obviously the more I bitch, hastily decision making admin team will change their minds.

Oh better yet, instead of privately messaging the team, or using modmail, lets fucking bitch on the reddit, upvote ourselves to the top, downvote the very same motherfucker your trying to appeal your ban to.

Cause thats going to fucking work.

Better yet, yankees, prerequisite, why don you fucking get the hell out.

popping in every now and then to say some witty bullshit that contributes absolutely nothing

Heres a special fuck you.

This fuck you is dedicated to the motherfuckers who live, criticise, and moan about admin crimes, admin abususes.

Fuck ya, go take a flying fucking leap, and go fuck yourselves.

Corrupt admins?

Leave.

Admin decision not go in your favor?

Cant deal with the decision?

Leave.

Want to complain about the balances of the server, ancap fucking advantage, and you offer nothing as to the solutions?

Leave

If you cant handle the fact that decisions made, amongst the owner, and even a small group of consultants, then you either gotta find another server, or put your own damned work into this shit.

I dont contribute nothing to the development team, and at this point I havent even been able to donate.

But to think this motherfucker, hundreds of hours of unique motherfucking game time, handled every controversial decision ever made, having to dedicate large sums of his private time as to keep you motherfuckers, you motherfucking complaining pieces of shits content, seriously, go. fuck. yourself.

The best damn argument

If you want to actually help, Id have all the more respect for ya.

But to those special few, ran and upkept  by motherfuckers who get no reward, who alot of the time work behind the scenes to keep your shit running smoothly, and when something goes astray, something isnt just quite right, gets a shitpost.

Your the kind of tpeople I despise

Whats the point of this post?

No clue.

Like I said I come home to see shit on the front page

And to see the dozens of fucking upvotes and downvotes

It pisses me off.

I miss the early days of this server, it was a good place to be, like living in a small town.

Now its like a fucking metropolis.u got the few good here and there, but overall its filled with shit flingers.

God damn fucking based goddamn monkeys.

To all you shit flingers, right now, give it to me.

You baseless fuckers.

Now that I finish writing this I wonder if this could even qualify as content on here

Either way

With all that said

Have a good goddamn fuckin day.

To ttk, but I just want to say, I love your server, I love the ideas, the purpose of it. Ive been playing since the very first day when a dozen players could be on and get 5 tick. I love this place, and even with the shit flingers I love, to some extent the community ive interacted with. Keep up the work man

*The Movement*

In CivCraft, especially along the Nether Highways, the Nether has evolved into the only desirable mode of transportation. Naturally, this leads to some issues in the mechanics of the experiment.

With the reduced travel time, this creates unrealistic migration patterns. And as we see with the HCF, the movement of fighters to any city on the server is done almost effortlessly, because almost every city has a nether portal.  

There are a few solutions to this

* The Nether should be made the same scale as the Overworld. This would, while allowing for resources to be gathered in it. However, I imagine having a Nether that is the same size as the Overworld map would put some unneeded strain on the server; 

* The Nether should be removed

* The Nether should become a prison like the End. By disabling the creation of Nether portals and having only a select few distributed across the Overworld

In addition to this, realistically, make port cities more accessible and desirable, and introduce a new dynamic in the form of overseas trade. It would also give ideologies and factions more distinct lines on their areas of control. 

---

*The Military*

With the arrival of the HCF players

In ttk2's explanation of the [philosophy](http://redd.it/rsr8c) of Citadel, in most cases, seem to do nothing but provide the same sense of false security one gets from living in a gated community. Yes, there is a wall, but it won't protect you unless you are actively defending it. There ought to be a way for walls to function without requiring players to actively defend them. As for solutions, there doesn't seem to be a good one.

* Nerf pillaring to make it difficult to scale up to the height of the average wall. Of course, but this would at least slow people down. However, it would negatively affect other aspects of game-play, and would probably require some sort of mod. Overall, probably not worth the cost;

* Create extremely costly and massive walls, an effective wall would still be obscenely costly to build and protect, or; 

* Create complex defense systems to function in tandem with the walls. The kind that griefers laugh at while they dig around and steal your redstone

At the moment, if they don't know it's there, they can't attack it. 

Defenses on CivCraft need a makeover. The aesthetically-pleasing wall is history. If you're going to be well-defended, and building off of those ideas. I suggest you all do the same. 

---

*The Experiment*

As for the actual experiment, new ones are rising, people are going off to hide, and others have taken up swords to defend themselves. 

With the arrival of the HCF fighters, but it was never an important aspect, and there was always room for neutrality. If there was no room for neutrality (indiscriminate killing), the offender was usually put down quickly by those who were equipped to PvP, for the good of the server community. That tended to be the role of the 'World Police' and bounty hunters. PvP was not necessary for a majority of players because there was a universal police force that would be there to protect them. 

This universal police force allowed players to focus on the more political and societal development aspects of the game. Now that we see what has happened when they are unable to maintain control, instead of relying on the 'World Police' to do it for them.  

[When I first founded STAR

---

Another thing I think we can learn from this is that in a time of crisis, there are only two options left. In this case we can fight a hopeless battle against a larger force than we can muster with greater skills than most of ours. Or we can avoid the aggressors altogether. The logical choice, clearly, is avoidance. With the options being oppression or avoidance, most of CivCraft seems to have chosen avoidance. 

The way I see it

We already see that with the inability to travel, many players are retiring from the cities and towns and moving where they are isolated and safe. As I've stated before, the desirable course of action for most CivCrafters is avoidance. And many CivCrafters have found that the best way to achieve this is to retire from the server for the time being or to go off by themselves. By doing so, they reduce the risk of being attacked, as they are now both less of a target and less of a threat.

The other option is for CivCrafters to become more united. I'm not talking about some resistance against the HCF fighters. I'm talking about a resistance against ourselves; against our tendency to go into hiding and wait for the problem to end. The community that we once had, talked with other people, has been greatly diminished in-game. And it's not because we are immobile, but because we choose not to run the risk of moving.

As a result of the Nether (as I addressed above) cities were constructed too far apart for normal travel between them. We came to rely too much on the Nether, and we need to adapt to it, for the good of the server and the community.

1357494087.0,162gqh,Mining Machines: Yay or Nay?,MoonShinerZ,51,10,77,"Hey y'all

After reading some of the posts from admins on this server, which is sort of similar to something done in Tekkit apparently. I'll try to explain it:

You take a dispenser, and all the iron blocks disappear / are consumed, and what is left is a 'Tier 1 Mining Machine'. You can pick it up into your inventory, it is called a 'Tier 1 Mining Machine,' and you can place it down wherever. 

When you place down a Mining Machine, gold ingots, redstone, coal, etc. But you place this 'fuel' inside the dispenser, you power it with redstone, and it will begin mining blocks in front of the dispenser. How far the mining goes, how big the tunnels that it mines are

Example:

A tier 1 mining machine mines a 1x1 tunnel up to 30 blocks away, it will destroy the diamond block but it also consumes it, so it won't drop the diamond. It requires redstone for fuel and consumes 1 redstone for every block it mines. Once it mines 500 blocks, the machine will 'break', and needs to be repaired by placing an iron block beside it and clicking on it, which will then be consumed and repair it.

A tier 5 mining machine could require a tier 4 mining machine and 20 diamond blocks to upgrade it. A tier 5 machine could mine a 3x3 tunnel straight forward up to 100 blocks away, it will drop diamonds if it hits diamond ore. It will mine up to 5000 blocks before it 'breaks', and requires 4 diamond blocks to repair.

These are really basic examples, how to repair it, how far it goes per tier, special cases/abilities when it hits ores, etc.

The main idea is to add a higher tech tree that players can use to mine out large areas

I already tried to run it by the admins

I've had multiple conversations with individuals from both sides of this conflict. Obviously I have conversed with numerous individuals from the ""CivCraft"" side, and community-building. I've also conversed with multiple people from the ""HCF"" side, including Pikaoku, MrTwiggy, McFluffykins, prerequisite, TravisSupreme, but I will say that I've gained a bit of empathy for both sides of this conflict


The ""HCF issues"" really began with the coming of MrTwiggy, shocked the participants of CivCraft, who generally followed an agenda of non-aggression (partially due to the interventions of the ""world police""). Members of the HCF, please understand that ""hardcore PvP"" and similar ideals of total war were completely foreign to this server prior to your arrival. Although your actions fall under the guidelines of this server, they were utterly unknown and incomprehensible to those of us who wished to engage in diplomacy and statemanship. This is the fault of neither party, as these issues had never previously been faced. However, you must realize that, the players of CivCraft would react with disgust and anger.


**To the previously established CivCraft populace:**

Your knee-jerk reaction to the actions of a few players is what contributed to the massive offensive that ultimately led to your subjugation. By labelling all ""HCF players"" as evil, ""prerequisite's group"", and ""Gordge's group"" (yes, I don't know much about the specifics, but spare me the complaints), became the ""HCF menace"". Moreover, the continued villianization of these groups (due in part to my own words) united them moreso and spurred them to fulfill the server's view of them: a maurading force that ruined the CivCraft experience. Except that they did not ruin the CivCraft experience. Their actions are completely permissible, under the current server rules. It took a massive chewing-out by Orthzar for me to realize this.


This was never more apparent to me than during a conversation with McFluffykins. McFluffykins attempted to negotiate peace for Mt. Augusta, he we spat in his face and labelled him a traitor. Any person would feel betrayed as a result, when they personally put their own neck on the line. Furthermore, McFluffykins said something truly revelatory to me: ""You've called us assholes, so we'll act like assholes."" The server's knee-jerk reactions, sweeping generalizations (yes, I realize the irony)


**To the ""incoming"" HCF players:**

You guys originally came to this server imagining a populace under the iron-fist of ""the ancaps"". However, your acts of ""total war"", such as the mass lava-ing of Mt. Augusta and the indiscriminate pearling of anyone who ""opposes"" you, led to further ostracizing. Instead of attempting to clean up your act and take responsibility for your actions, you continued under the guise of ""establishing a new order"", a lie which most everyone saw through as an enactment of your own personal agenda.


When people suggest that you pearl the members of HCF who are acting like assholes


Overall

I've probably missed about 50% of what I actually wanted to say in this post

Edit 1: I just realized I posted this as ""DEER CIVRAFT"" instead of ""DEER CIVCRAFT"". However

This drove Imme into a mad frenzy, stroking his Egodick. He got over his heated thoughts after catching the sight of Oracle's slime balls, and regained composure, standing up to alert the rest of the AnCaps that the day has begun. Tact left the candid scene, hearing Oracle yell, ""YES! YES! FOOF ALL OVER ME!""

Tactful ran to his sex slave Exultant, he could hear Exultant moaning, ""AWH YAH MATE GIT IT IN DER. CRIKEY M8"". Exultant drew his ""shoiney"" stingray, plunging it into Tactful's ravine. He pulled out and the dangling cocoa beans were plentiful enough to make morning cookies later. Before the two could mine each other dry, they were uninterrupted by Orthzar. He was holding a block in his hands, amber in colo(u)r. Orethzar said eagerly, ""I have some extra ores left over from the map reset, uh, ""I hope you guys don't have netherwarts

Before the HCF came, we were still all one community really. I used to wander the map, helping people wherever I went. I spent much time wandering the nether roads, exploring ruins and meeting and talking to new people. I would take a stack or two of melon slices and a stack of cobble (from my store room) and I was off, seeing new places and finding new things. It was some of the best fun I ever had in my life, just finding someone new and talking to them, finding out their story as I helped them in whatever endeavor they were doing. I met a great many wonderful people this way, Dr_Oracle

And then the HCF attacked.

Many of my friends left, I kept on. I continued my helping work. When Augusta was burning and covered in lava, I was there cleaning it up. When some randoms I knew needed help all the way across the map, I ran through the nether and got there and helped them. This was my reality. When the mass pearlings were taking place, I decided to lay low. I went to an island base and did nothing for a few weeks. Then when the menace passed, I went back to my work.

While the server recovered

I just can't cope anymore. I used to think I was safe

&gt;The basic flaw in the liberal separation of “human rights”
and “property rights” is that people are treated as ethereal
abstractions. If a man has the right to self-ownership
control of his life
right to sustain his life by grappling with and transforming
resources; he must be able to own the ground and the
resources on which he stands and which he must use. In short
to sustain his “human right”—or his property rights in his
own person—he must also have the property right in the
material world
rights are human rights
which liberals attempt to maintain. The human right of a free
press depends upon the human right of private property in
newsprint.     

&gt;In fact
property rights. The human right of free speech is simply the
property right to hire an assembly hall from the owners
own one oneself; the human right of a free press is the property right to buy materials and then print leaflets or books and
to sell them to those who are willing to buy. There is no extra
“right of free speech” or free press beyond the property rights
we can enumerate in any given case. And furthermore
resolve any apparent conflicts of rights that may crop up.
Consider
generally concede that a person’s “right of freedom of speech”
must be curbed in the name of the “public interest”: Justice
Holmes’ famous dictum that no one has the right to cry “fire”
falsely in a crowded theater. Holmes and his followers have
used this illustration again and again to prove the supposed
necessity for all rights to be relative and tentative rather than
precise and absolute.       

&gt;But the problem here is not that rights cannot be pushed
too far but that the whole case is discussed in terms of a vague
and wooly “freedom of speech” rather than in terms of the
rights of private property. Suppose we analyze the problem
under the aspect of property rights. The fellow who brings on
a riot by falsely shouting “fire” in a crowded theater is
a paying patron. If he is the owner
fraud on his customers. He has taken their money in exchange
for a promise to put on a movie or play, he
disrupts the show by falsely shouting “fire” and breaking up
the performance. He has thus welshed on his contractual obligation
his patrons and has violated their property rights.      

&gt;Suppose
and not the owner. In that case
right of the owner—as well as of the other guests to their paid for performance. As a guest
owner’s property or to disrupt the performance the owner is
putting on. His malicious act
rights of the theater owner and of all the other patrons.
There is no need
restricted in the case of the false shouter of “fire.” The rights
of the individual are still absolute; but they are property rights.
The fellow who maliciously cried “fire” in a crowded theater
is indeed a criminal
speech” must be pragmatically restricted on behalf of the
“public good”; he is a criminal because he has clearly and
obviously violated the property rights of another person.

**The Idea**


Players spawn with a written book in their inventory that contains a very short and dumbed down guide to civcraft. This guide will include *brief* run-downs of the server's mods (and links to more information)


**Why?**


There is a myriad of pros to this. 

1. Makes it easier for new players to learn - a lone book being the only thing in your inventory draws more attention than a sentence in a sidebar of some reddit somewhere. It also will only give information necessary for them to understand civcraft (saving them from reading mass guides).

2. Clears up misconceptions for new players -  When I first joined this server, I spawned directly in the middle of nine (late december, so it was pretty developed). The large structures were so impressive I shrugged civcraft off as being too easy mode and decided it wasn't for me. First impressions make a world of difference and the guide can make sure those impressions are accurate.

3. Gives other players less to explain - I've helped my share of newbies, or didn't understand it. Having a guide like this makes it easier for others to explain, and gives us more time to go into detail about things that can't be put into a guide - history, purpose, community, economics, etc. instead of teaching them how to use citadel.


**Criticisms of this**


&gt; If these hooligans can't even read a sidebar I don't want them here at all!


This is an awfully judgmental attitude. Civcraft's largest active population of a city was 17 people in strongman's population poll, the more players we get.


I'll edit in more criticisms as they are brought up and addressed. 


**UPDATE**


A majority of people agree with having a mechanic guide, everyone, for your feedback and attention.

There is no question that an absolute sprint toggle such as the one used by Iusethisforgood provides significant advantages not possible to simulate without use of the modification, such as knockback while standing still, while moving through obstacles, and while changing direction. As such, absolute sprint toggles are a violation of cheating policy and are actionable.
	
As for “sprint buttons” that merely simulate a double-tap

Should this violation result in a ban for Iusethisforgood? This was the subject of significant discussion among the administrators. One can see how someone inexperienced in PVP might not have understood why it would constitute a violation of the cheating policy. Precedent and policy, and Iusethisforgood violated the rules. Regretfully, there is no room for discretion in this matter.

**The crime is sprint-hacking. The sentence is ban.**

The KFC is a somewhat cohesive, but will vehemently deny it (Review some more hacked clients for me on your YouTube channel, mcfluffykins), and we're almost certain they VPN/proxy (These guys are willing to push every boundary they can in order to achieve their ends, it sort of is implied that they will also cheat to do so). They can log on in a large mass whenever something vital is going on, but generally only a handful will log on regularly.


**So


* Because of the nature of the simulation, and we're somewhat hampered in our ability to respond to such attacks. 

* We can never truly know how many of them there are at any point in time

* We have superior numbers

**So


We need more coordination, all that we need is some coordination. We can have a distributed army united by a single goal who would be able to respond to any major conflict on a moment's notice. It would be the KFC's worse nightmare. They wouldn't be able to look at the player list and know whether or not it was a good idea to attack/defend. We could potentially completely shut the KFC down without even fighting them. Pearling them would be fucking trivial. Cracking their vaults would be a joke. 

This plan also has the added benefit of people being able to defend themselves in the future KFC-less world, creating a defensive environment similar to Switzerland. Everyone in the country/Civcraftia has the tools and the training necessary to help defend the entire system, when needed. 


**Some things I'd like to pre-emptively address before I continue.**


* Yes

* No, it will be an army that helps fight existential threats like the KFC, and then goes back to their cities and towns afterwards, and continues on with their 'lives'.

* Yes, and are due for retribution. This will have the added effect of instilling paranoia in the fascists.

**So how do I propose we rectify the current problems?**

* I will organize a team of people currently in the resistance to run a boot camp

* I will organize an informational network that will allow rapid response. I currently have setup a Civcraft IRC (#civcraft on gamesurge.net) channel, etc.) and of course we already have the subreddit and Mumble. Unfortunately, a subreddit isn't an ideal way to send and receive information, and not enough people use Mumble. I propose everyone create a Civcraft-specific Gmail (civcraft&lt;in-game name&gt;@gmail.com) account, and create desktop notifications, that way information can be relayed to everyone, whether they're online or not.

* A team of commanders will be trained to lead any troops in combat. Combat seems simplistic

I'm glad they came as well

&gt;It just shows what can happen when a destructive state gets too powerful.

I don't think this is a good comparison

These guys came here and outmatched every single established faction of a nine month old server in the space of a few weeks. They didn't rise like some overly charismatic dictator, because the game of Civcraft just doesn't do the job we all hoped it did.

* **The nether being a 1:8 ratio to the real world meant that all difficulty and logistics of travel between locations simply isn't a factor.** The HCF is able to be anywhere in a very short period of time for little to no cost

* Ttk2 has already proposed a possible solution to it, and potentially goes against a large point of the simulation. A global defense force isn't something that should *have* to be in every player's interest.

* Other than aesthetics and continual exposure to other players via chat range, Augusta or Fort PJ doesn't matter when it is still only going to take me a minute or two to reach any other trading area. Being in Communa, Haven or Nine doesn't seem to do anything at all to keep me safer from attack by griefers, and the failure of the The World Police has demonstrated that even combined efforts of players here don't do anything to ensure safety. Columbia, one of the most impressive virtual collaborative efforts I have ever seen, stands as a collection of mostly abandoned ruins that each voice a subtle reminder of all these locations being built for no reason at all.

---

Lets start with the ultimate question

If we are to listen to the sidebar it is an experiment for and about communities, to organize and live together in relative harmony. 

The key is consequences

The crowning achievement of Civcraft can be summed up in one word

PrisonPearl is our system, escape all consequences for their actions, and continue to create chaos. We had players cycling through 8 or more accounts, be they stolen or borrowed, never using one for longer than it took to create disorder. For Civcraft to the successful in any capacity we had to stop this cold, it was with that in mind that Exultant created a pearl script to identify and ban alts and integrated it into PrisonPearl. 

I would really love to talk more about the details of its operation

Of course while a work of significant skill the script is by no means sentient and relies entirely on human intervention to provide exclusionary data

RattlerTank was attempting to walk the finest line possible

If it where not this location, for every situation the onus should be placed on us to ensure that he was fully informed as to every detail of that line, in an ideal world this would be reasonable. In an ideal world every player would read every single document we ever write before so much as touching their Minecraft client. In this ideal would we would also be able to write a perfect document suffering from no ambiguity. 

But we do not live in that world, but a reality of the English language. Some would argue that we should reverse the consequences of this misinterpretation or have spelled it out in excruciating detail, but what is a proper level of detail and what is a proper threshold of understanding? Should we unpearl every player confused as to the nature of the server? Anyone who claims to have misinterpreted what we say? We would have to if we where to be fair. In administration you must think of the consequences of your actions on the past and the future as well as the situation and the fact remains there is no way out we can provide Rattler that is fair to everyone else. If it where not for this consideration I would be at the very least ambivalent about reversing this if not supportive of it, but I *must* take into account the consequences of this action on both past and future cases. I do not have the luxury of doing what seems most fair in this situation if I wish not to be terribly unfair to literally hundreds of other players who have not the luxury of such public support.

Civcraft is a massive undertaking of programming, no matter how insultingly they where presented. But the fact remains we are human volunteers, when Rattler attempted to report his issues to me in mumble my response was ""Send it to modmail or I do not care"" because no human can keep track of even a quarter of the players on this server every day, much less all of their problems in their number and detail, we ask for this simple consideration for our humanity and the isolation of what we need to keep track of for our sanity. 

In the end I have one final point, it means we require a higher class of criminal than any so far have achieved. Civcraft is about society, not PVP, about those people who associate with you and how they do so, not the way you fight.

I have seen too many people put work into building small villages and cities only to see them become abandoned when they only receive a trickle of new users who leave soon after

If you build your own city, not an easy task.

You also may have to form a government or management structure of some sort

I've found it much easier and more satisfying to simply go where the people are, which you could learn from without the pain of your own failures if you joined such a city to begin with.

Consider forming a private or public society

Another thing to note is that some less planned cities have a bit of a sprawl problem which you can use to your advantage. It is possible

Another advantage to this as far as the server at large is concerned is that the more populous and socially complicated a city becomes

Events ( In order):
No item events

Parkour- Whoever can complete the course the fastest.

Diving- That game dropper

Hurdles- A straight run with single blocks or double blocks/pits to run over. 25m 50m 75m


Redstone speed build- Whoever can build the best redstone invention with the items in hand (Randomized every round)

Spleef- Last man Standing Wins

Sailing- Fastest sailor wins


Archery- With a 3x3 cobble box and a wood button in the middle and painting on the 4 corners if you hit the button that's 5 points

Boxing (sumo)- Whoever can kick the other person out of the ring first wins

Gladiator- Last man Standing wins that round (In Iron armor and stone sword)

How it works: To participate in these games each athlete from a town needs to pay 1 diamond, 2nd gets Gold, and 3rd gets Iron. Whoever gets 1st place goes to the next round and faces the other people that also won diamond in other rounds. If you win this you get another diamond and crowed the best at this event. Also in the event of a lag spike the round will change to a best 2 out of 3 event for the competitors. On a similar note in the event of a tie the competitors who tied will share the highest title or (if in this case in combat) fight it out again.


Final tally: A diamond is worth 3 points, Orion, and Dumathoin along with an Official signed book recognizing that they won the First ever Civcraft Olympic Games.


To compete: To compete you must belong to a town/city You must pay the entry fee


Prizes: If you win the event you get the prize of it for example i won Diamond in parkour i get to keep that diamond. And later i get a book of all my total statistics saying that i officially won diamond in Archery

When is this?: The ETA For this event will be August 24th 4PM and August 25th 6PM. August 24th will be the Events day so all the events will be hosted that day and the scores will be tallied. The next day will be the Awards ceremonies where the Athletes are given their awards and honored.


If you are going to compete: Post in the commends with the names of the people that are coming and what events they will participate in. I will clarify you results in a reply to your comments and if also make sure to msg me in Minecraft so i can add you to the full list. Make sure that you also have the fee on hand when you get to Orion to pay to Matchbox124. If you do not have this fee you will not be accepted into the Olympic games. A list of things you will need when you come are food, and a bed. Housing with a free Apartment room for your Town will be provided but no more for anybody else (unless you have a coach).


Spectators: Everybody is welcome to spectate and come watch the games. We encourage that you bring money and also trade with Orion to collect goods. We also recommend that you rent out an apartment room. And as for safety Orion will provide a VERY HEAVY Security that will protect the spectators and the Olympians. Also betting is encouraged.


Remember: This is a time for Fun among players and not to be fighting. Absolutely no City tension must occur in Orion all will be settled in the games and if you PVP with another town/city Without a pass from Matchbox124 or in Self defense your town/city will be disqualified and you will be asked to leave or be deported by force.. What ever Matchbox124 or whoever he gives authority to says goes.

Our capital of Blackcrown is located on the crest of a mountain, either in honor of its resident or because of its location.

Appointed architects are the sole builders of the surface city, and each individual house. The undercity, on the other hand, has no such restrictions. Each resident also owns the land underneath their house's foundations, free to do with as they please.

Other perks include public cauldrons and bakeries, free lodging for visitors, large markets, international rail lines, and beautiful scenery.

We're looking for more Game of Thrones fans who'd love to role play, that's a definite bonus.

Here's some photos of Blackcrown and concept art:

Lucifelle, but the one thing I remember you said that tweaked me is when I made the comment that you need a good dick, that means I endorse the raping of you.

Its that

No

It means I dislike you because Ive had negative interactions with you in the past

But let me be straight here

I hopped into that channel because I was drunk, [I regret nothing.](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/005/342/129969639840.gif)

And while were at it

None of you people that I can recall that were in that channel knew pork not one bit.
 
He never goes on mumble, and yet you supposedly want to talk to him like you know him, like your best buds with him.

The only people that remotely know pork are people who played in Augusta

The first goddamn thing that was said when it was realized the second voice was pork was man I thought that was a girl.

Go get fucked

To the people that are disappointed in me?

Really?

How many of you really know anything of me?

hey I said the word nigger

I dont mean the casual

If thats what you want to go with fine

But if you want to get at that I have some deep hatred for people based on their color

I guess this would be where I boast I have friends of different races

But let us not forget one crucial thing, something something meme, get rekt.

But one last thing while were on racism.

Obviously the word nigger triggers something in most of us fairly quickly, or who is using it.

But what about that subtle shit?

Wigger?

What is that again

That isnt some racist shit?

Dont get me wrong though, and never will.

Maybe this is what I really need to stop me from coming back here


Hey but lets play the be the better man game right quick, cause I might offend someone.

Would you, the situation being some person, who you or may not know being a bafoon by taking em on in like a pissing match?

Ya, I accept that, never once said I wasnt being drunk and or stupid, but how many times did I say to kick me out of the channel if you didnt like how I was presenting myself?

At one point you say that the channel wasnt endorsing my behavior.

Bullshit.

You wanted a show and you got it.

If you didnt I could have been kicked, and you surely wouldnt have posted it on the reddit for even more bullshit for you roll around in.

Because lets be honest

A pigs slop pen

Thats why this server can never be an ""experiment""

Unless you take experiment in the sense of a bunch of teens taking drugs, lol ""prescribed"" then it is quite the productive drug.

And to the ones that say

Have none of you realized I dont ever play?

Like ya

Wait

I couldve sworn he was here this whole time.

Ha.

I guess this post comes off quite bitter dont it?

Like a lonely

I guess its somewhat true.

The fact that I spent my whole time for the past year, while avoiding reality, fooling myself into believing that in the future things would magically get better.

First of all, aren't particularly liked right now. The reason is very simple. Like always, the 2.0 launch wasn't exactly smoothe, and there is simply not enough space for everyone who wants to play Civcraft at the same time. Now, imagine you are a Civ-veteran. You have a faction, and you have been planning towards the 2.0 launch for weeks. Every day, every hour counts, when it is in a power vacuum


N.o 1: If you are starting a village, too. If you do reveal your position, someone will come, sooner or later, that isn't coming to admire the cobbledick statue. Stay under the radar, for the time being.


N.o 2: Be ready for guests. If you can, you have to hold what you take with strength, and a sign and a Reddit post won't keep the baddies out.


N.o 3: Hide yo' valuables. Anything that's worth having is worth hiding. Either carry it with you or bury it in a well hidden chest. Use your imagination! Unpleasant company is less bad when they haven't stolen anything that matters.


N.o 4: Reinforce and rebuild! Sooner or later, and above all, learn how the Citadel block reinforcement plug-in works and use it.
Short version: Smelt cobblestone to stone -&gt; equip stone in hotbar -&gt; type /ctr -&gt; click the blocks you want reinforced -&gt; type /ctoff when done -&gt; blocks reinforced

N.o 5: Find and associate with like minded individuals. This will provide mutual protection

And those are the best


Now, until the server's more stable and all the veterans and factions have settled in a bit, which will probably reduce newfriend resentment. If you haven't got a big plan of your own, it's better to leave prime time server slots for those who do, and join in later.

**Unoccupied does not mean abandoned!**

The nether road map has never shown abandoned portals and never will. Greyed out portals are unoccupied. This is now made even cleared by you needing to interact with a button that says ""Show unoccupied portals"".

Unoccupied means these towns might not have active players in them. This does not mean players have given up their land/property rights. These [two](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cgsit/must_see_cities/) [posts](http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1cgxlu/question_salvaging_abandoned_property/) today

I myself own land and property in towns like Liberty, and I still have possessions at them. Just because Saga and Populi are not active does not mean somebody can come and claim my stuff.

In short. Stop misusing the word **abandoned**. Instead thing twice and use the word **unoccupied** or phrase **not active**. Saying abandoned leads people to think they can claim what is not rightfully theirs.",self,t5_2tm1t,False,,MODERATOR-or-ADMIN,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/1chfvn/unoccupied_does_not_mean_abandoned/

* After significant amounts of research I keep on finding mixed reviews for Black Lotus when it comes to Minecraft, thus we will save money for trying rather than lose it as we may by diving in with Black Lotus. So, its your money, what thoughts, comments, and concerns do you have?

* What would you all think of allowing normal users to edit the subreddit wiki? We can set minimum karma and account age requirements so I think we could feasibly keep the content of quality. 

* I went ahead and made an affiliate account

* Lets start digging up those advertisement plans

* Finally if you are a developer and have some spare time go ahead an join us in the CivcraftDev google group and direct your efforts to either per day pearling cost in PrisonPearl or JukeAlert.

Changes for Civtest:

Since everything has seemingly calmed down, childish, and what not. I have been reforming my actions and I think one of the final steps of reformation is a reparations thread to make amends with those I have wronged.

These reparations will have some guidelines though:
---
* **Anyone who fought actively against me will not receive reparations.** 

&gt;This may be done on a case-to-case basis

* **Wanting reparations such as 100d / day.** 

&gt;Claims such as me shouldn't be put on me to blame since I'm paying reparations. I never had access to the World Border Vault so it would have been impossible for me to free you.

* **Crimes committed by HCF as a group. If you can prove I was there and did damages

&gt;Do not put the blame on me unless you have either snitch evidence or a verbal story that I can remember.

In order to receive reparations
---

* **Name** (Your IGN)
* **Your claim against me** (Story of what happened. This may help in me remembering if it happened if you cannot supply proof.)
* **What you are seeking** (Items / Love)
* **Proof** (This is highly recommended. Post with proof get higher attention than those without.)

Extra Info:
---
* Hurt feels and other joke claims are not wanted here

* Any Myra / BHC / Gimmick / WP that are in alliance with those who are holding innocents will not receive any reparations. 

**Why should I pay people doing the exact same thing as I did?**

* If an arbitrator is requested

* Upvote for visibility. This is a self-post so I receive no karma for it.

I'm Theodius ingame and I live in ++. I sell potions and wood and currently own a business with my friend which sells potions in opportune locations across the nether and in some cities.

Very few of you will know who I am, I rarely enter the 0,0 areas and generally dislike sticking around in any of Liberty/Augusta/Rothbard for too long. That's my personal preference.

Today, I found myself trapped in Augusta (I had been checking a shop I'm invested in and logged out there a few hours earlier). This was with no weapons, armour, resources - nothing, really, except various worthless bits of garbage. I was trapped due to the portal being blocked up, pointing to the HCF players on the other side.

After a while I volunteered to, by being let out of the city, as the guys on the inside wanted to know the situation surrounding the nether side of the portal I wanted to get back home and continue with my business and had nothing of worth so, hey, why not. I was promptly let out and the minute I rendered the other side of the portal, I was pearled. To be expected, really. 

What shocked me, whilst not quite believing that accusation, I wasn't sure that they would let me go. 

""Hey,000 blocks away, any chance I can go free?"" 

""yeah sure""

...and I was free. Just like that. So I ran home, top level potions, to dole out to the valorous citizens of Civcraftia should I get the opportunity. And so I, and friends, headed out to the portal.

This is my next point of contention and the thing that got my back up generally. As I got to the portal, just not well), the best thing to do would to log off and allow other fighters to join.

Now, shape or form; this sort of advice is probably given to people in a situation of this gravity. My issue is that it contradicts the nature of the game. We're supposed to be playing as a community of different cities and cultures and, during a time of war, chipping in to help eachother and do what we can, in any way. Something about other citizens with perhaps less-than-exemplary gear being asked to log-off in favour of those better equipped irritated me a little; especially with this wild-scale stigmitisation of the HCF and 'in this together' attitude.

The second example of this was when we got to Rothbard (Josh informed us to get to Rothbard if we wanted to help). When there, what we could do. His response? ""Not no go away"". I said I can help, and I have friends far better geared than me that could help. ""in iron?"" was the response. Fair enough; I still have highest level potions (which, I gotta point out, were required later on by a few people). Again, this just seems extremely rude and belittling of people who want to help. I don't have a thin skin; this interaction just sorta...in one ear and out the other. But again, it contradicts this idea that we're supposed to be a community fighting against the big HCF bad guys.

That was it for me until I logged in later this morning and asked about the situation. I was told the HCF guys have been banned for x-raying via world-downloader - some were happy, I started my journey back to home when, near 0,0, I was warned by Matticus that a few rogue HCF were around and about pearling everyone they saw as a protest. I stopped to eat (which would be my downfall) and have a peek around; I saw them come from the tunnel and pegged it. I was, unfortunately caught, as my speed pot ran out whilst I was eating and I didn't even notice. Pearled

I spoke to the pearler, and that I would be released when his/her friends were unbanned. I responded that I thought the banning was a little harsh myself and had been sympathetic to HCF people recently (which I had). Guess what? Unpearled on the spot for being gracious, non-abusive and talking. And they threw in a brewing stand as a thankyou.

That's pretty much where it ends and my conclusions are as follows:

1. The stigmitisation and generally pariah-like treatment of several HCF members is pretty ridiculous on the server. We all have our political leanings and views on the 'ancap clique' but in a lot of places the mere mention of the acronym 'HCF' seems to make every frown. It's ridiculous and while, I'd say there are an equal amount of horrid players who have nothing to do with HCF. (I also realise the actions of RattlerTank/Twiggy have caused the title of HCF player to become such a dark mark, but-- still.) That said, Apache and Gordge weren't pleasant people, but a lot of their bravado is the same as a lot of the absolute garbage thrown around on the internet these days. In fact, so-called 'reformed griefer' whosnick came out with some of the most appalling insults (involving Downs syndrome and the like).

2. AnCaps are, in both ingame and meta senses. Matticus was perhaps the only polite one I spoke to all day; and other people were outright ignored when trying to offer help.

3. Perhaps the worst crime the HCF are guilty of is releasing players who are far worse than they will ever be - honestly. The HCF truly seem to prefer to PvP over all else - they seem to enjoy fighting man-to-man rather than large-scale griefing (touch wood

4. On what basis have they been banned for hacking? I realise that this server is not a democracy and the admin's word is final, from the sounds of things, several other normal regulars on the server.

This is more an outpouring/spewing of thoughts on today and the general attitudes of various players. All I will say is that the HCF have risen in my estimations and the AnCaps have sunk

As a final thought, Agraria and Gerald both received pretty horrendous bouts of griefing by at least one notorious, previously vaulted criminal. I know that the HCF players released them, but perhaps we weren't chasing the real bad guys.",,False,self,1356079354.0,t3_157vwu

This is a sincere apology to all those who were banned. You are unbanned. None of the players you un-pearled were re-pearled

The last six attempts we had to deal with on Foofed's vault were all illegitimate, our programmer eyes start to well up and panic, and we assume a form of exploitation has been used. The other six times, those assumptions were well-founded. Upon manual inspection it appeared that you didn't break a lot of the blocks you would have otherwise had to break if this was a perfectly constructed vault. This obviously wasn't the case, and you have our sincere apologies.

You were banned for a period of about thirty minutes while the few of us who were online tried to work out what happened. We spent that time waking up both the Citadel coder and the coder of our logging systems, but it wasn't helping the instigators of this incident in the way we thought it was; to find this out we had to wake up Citadel's developer and talk to them about it. He wasn't very happy, we weren't very happy; it's not been the happiest of times to be honest. Citadel is our most integral plugin with a database of over 4,500,000 entries... to put it lightly, Citadel is catastrophically and irrevocably complicated, and maintenance of this data is... not easy.

I'm also bothered by folks hemming and hawing about the ""rights"" of people to say and do certain things in-game that have a very real

Words are signifiers, holocausts, and lynchings. *All of these worst crimes against humanity begin with and are sustained by ""mere words"" which became attitudes, depending entirely on how people exactly like you and I chose to use and respond to them.* Words have consequences, I know this is hard for a lot of folks to swallow but it's a truth validated again and again throughout history.

Bear that in mind next time you see bigotry in chat or mumble, just as it means you shouldn't let your real-life self get bent out of shape about in-game drama. Bigotry, however, is not an in-game fantasy, it is a real-life problem manifesting and reproducing itself in-game. Allowing bigots to hide behind the ostensible liberal freedoms of Civcraft is like playing chess with a klansman and thus excusing his insults of ""blacks"" as being part of the game, you're the one being played. How you choose to treat those who spread bigotry is up to you, and if you confine yourself to an in-game mentality you're ignoring and at worst enabling the spreading of their filth in a broader context. 

It also bears mentioning that **it does not violate your liberty to afford others a basic level of dignity and courtesy.**

This is a good time to step *out* of the game and ask yourself what kind of community you want to be a part of, if you're a decent person, so why tolerate it in Civcraft with some appeal to ""play-rights""?

My bottom line is this: **My real-world commitment to anti-bigotry trumps any in-game commitment to free speech or any other ""play"" like that.** I have no interest in humoring or ""playing"" with racists, Dr. King, Harvey Milk, Susan B. Anthony, and others would be at all interested in appeals to Augustan constitutional law or debates as to whether pearling an obnoxious bigot is a violation of the NAP. I find appeals to in-game notions of justice and principle re:bigotry extremely hollow because they imply the toxicity of bigotry and the consequences of tolerating it are contained to the game. It is more important to me that bigots be shunned, humiliated, and ostracized than maintaining the authenticity of this ""simulation"" for my amusement. Choosing to *play* with these people and humor them through in-game mechanics should not be a foregone conclusion

------------------------------------------------------


**tldr:** Get real, we're tolerating and ultimately encouraging their behavior in a broader, real-world social context. It's akin to saying, ""Racism is a detriment to society, but not bad enough that it can't be entertained in my little block-stacking game, because we're making politics n' stuff.""

So, and please blow off whatever pathetic attempts they make to pull the conversation into a strictly in-game sphere. Do the same also to anyone who tries to defend tolerating them based on appeals to in-game ""principles"" or ""legality"".

When you see people calling each other ""faggot"", please, and if you go so far as to pearl them you wont hear any complaints from me. As far as I'm concerned, they can take their ball and go play another game.

1354869782.0,14fpr0,My first couple hours in this new world.,hakrsakr,39,5,34,"Tonight, it appeared to me as a subreddit for a particular server.  As I scanned the page

I spawned, mansion, a row of portals to far-off lands, other players, or any sign of welcome.  I saw nothing.  I was alone, in a hilly forest of tall trees and snow.  A message instantly flashed across my mind: ""You wake up in an unfamiliar place.""  Indeed I had.  But I knew that I could not stand there pondering for long, for a nagging feeling told me that I must find shelter until daylight came.  And so I set out

As I collected the bare necessities and created various tools to assist me, like the kind one feels when their gut senses danger but their body cannot.  I decided to try and make contact with someone, anyone.  Fearing the presence of monsters I raised my voice and asked, ""Are there any mobs on this server?""  Another message flashed across my mind: ""No one hears you.""  Ignoring the question of this omnipresent entity entering my mind, I decide to assume the worst and find some shelter.  I trekked back into where I had dug some stone out of the side of a hill.  I start to create some more room and create a workstation to keep myself busy for the rest of the night when I hear a short hissing sound, followed by a loud bang.  Instantly I felt my mind torn from my body, placed in some sort of... limbo.  My vision was tinted an ominous red, to be respawned or leave this world.  My curiosity being far from satisfied

I again suddenly found myself in a forest, pressing question:  Where was my stuff?  I frantically searched myself and the immediate area, but none of my belongings from my previous... existence were to be found.  Hmph.  I hiked through the forest to a clearing atop a ridge, hoping to spy some familiar terrain.  In one direction the forest I had just been in extended as far as the eye can see.  In the other direction, across an icy river, appeared to be the forest I found myself in the first time.  I raced to it, hoping to find comfort in some familiarity and maybe even finding where I died.  But as I paced through it I saw that it was not the same forest; the trees looked the same but this one was more mountainous than hilly, I again started to gather means of survival.  As I worked, ""Hello?""  Again

Once I felt prepared enough to travel, swam across lakes, all the while looking for signs of others.  My heart lept when I peered down from a cliff and saw a small house with a measly wheat farm next to it.  I quickly hobbled down to it, only to find it abandoned.  The house was empty aside from a chest containing nothing and two signs on the wall.  One seemed to be a snarky note from one player to another, the other a message from what I guessed to be the owner.  He stated that he went on a trip to some sort of Greek-sounding city, along with a date:  6/30/2102.  My birthday.  Seeing that this was December now, I guessed that he wouldn't be coming back.  Nonetheless, left a sign with my name and the date I was there

I crossed more terrain, but nothing substantial.  Time passed and it was getting dark.  I decided to keep moving, for some reason feeling safer that way.  Soon after dark I strode up a grassy knoll and saw a magnificent house!  It was large, bright, well decorated, with a large field of wheat growing around the lake in front of it.  I started to run over to it, but stopped myself:  What if there was someone here?  Would they be friendly?  Would they attack me?  I drew my unwieldy stone sword and slowly approached the house.  

I didn't see anyone, it worked rather easily and I was in.  I carefully fixed the wall and then turned to survey the inside of the house, pleased with what I saw.  It was well lit inside as well and had a comfy orange and white wool rug.  Along one wall under a window was a workbench situated in a stone countertop, with a flowerpot in the corner.  Along another wall were a pair of stoves.  Above the stoves were the stairs, which led to a large upper room containing only a bed in the corner and another workbench.  I busied myself with the stoves and workbench, sorting and crafting the materials I had gathered on my journey thus far.  Soon it was daylight, and I decided to take a break and explore around the house.  

I first went back to the wheat farm by the lake.  There was wheat everywhere!  I took a bountiful harvest, I headed back to the house.  

I again worked with and organized my now many belongings as the night passed.  Suddenly, I had been roughing it for the past few days.  I tried the chests, and they were unlocked.  One contained some miscellaneous farming and food items, the other some utility stuff and building materials.  Hoping the owner wouldn't mind, I took some materials I needed out of one chest and continued working.  Once I was done, I replaced what I didn't use and gave the owner a little extra of my stuff for his hospitality.

It all began in Kizantium: NKCamp and I were hunting down a raider that Mister_Hilter had informed us of. I felt a chill, it was just the jitters. I noticed that I was unable to send or receive messages, but I shrugged it off as a fluke.

We ran at the raider, to send him to the End to learn his lesson. But when I attempted to summon him, I was met with a chilling message: This is an ordinary pearl.

**An ordinary pearl.**

But...what had happened to the man I had just slaughtered?! NKCamp reached out to him, my mind spinning. He examined it and threw it, hoping to reverse whatever terrible curse had befallen me. But it vanished, and the raider stayed in the End.

NK went into the nether, he nudged me into the Kizantium portal. I went through, with him close behind. But he was shocked to see a motionless Sami next to him, and another peering into the iron door!

I was the one at the door, but I couldn't even pick them up.

It was as if I wasn't even there. As if I didn't exist.

----

* As many ideas as we have for the second iteration I think we should strive to keep it simple and not go too far with it. That being said figuring out how far is too far may be a little difficult

* As a note

* Veins and ores

* JukeAlert is a must for our update and I would be very interested in seeing something like the proposed time delay strengthening of reinforcements. 

* Opinions seem mixed on morephysics and factorymod

* Enchanting enchanting

* Keep in mind here that addressing major problems does present major costs in its own way



Changes for Civcraft:
----

* While we work through everything Civcraft will remain situation normal for the time being

* Proposed: Move development and testing to 1.5 once we roll this new PrisonPearl version. 

* ariehkovler promoted to minion level moderator. The invitation of new Janitor level moderators is pending a short debate with existing admins. 

* I have been informed that several people have gone way out into deep nether, at the end of the week (Sunday) I will border the nether at 15k and delete all chunks generated outside that range. 

* In the next week or so we will restart the server and have double the ram and processing power from Javapipe


------


Changes for Civtest:
----

* Erocs has returned and is has now created [this](https://github.com/erocs/JukeAlert.git) copy of the JukeAlert github which I suggest everyone work off of if they desire to contribute hopefully we can get it ready for testing in the near future.

Second, no existing portals, no established farms, no nothing. Each faction can decide their own priorities, but clearly continuing feuds should not be one. 

So therefore I'm asking that everyone put down differences and work together now to help out in any way possible for the reset of the map

* **I am going to go ahead and layout the defense to what eagles is going to say so that everyone knows.** 

* Reason my brother and I waited a day to post: I thought that Hamster was going to be banned for cheating and playing with 2 pearled alts.
* Lem0nland91111s connection with Lazerwolf22022: Lazerwolf22022 is my little brothers account. During the original HCF war my account lem0nland91111 was pearled fighting crashete and because I had no alt and my brother did not like pvp, helping around Arx. 
* Any log in log out data: At my house we have two computers. A shitty laptop and my gaming computer
* Why Lazerwolf22022 does not make sense to be my alt anymore: After I gave my little brother back his account I bought an account replacing it as a combat alt. This account is Lem0nland91112
* Why it was not me who got pearled by hamster at Arx: First off I never walk around without prot4 on and some pearls. Second I know hamster is bad news so why would I converse with him at all (before being pearled) and not logout when he was looking at me? I also would not of wasted time talking to my captors. I would of immediately started messaging Allies. 
* Why my little brother told Hamster he was lem0nland91111: My little brother had gotten use to random people thinking he was me and does not like to explain himself to people so I told him if any unknown player talks to you its ok to pretend to be me unless they state things you can not understand or tell me. 
* Why I made the post for my brother: He is in 6th grade. I think it would be better if a 16 year old defended him instead of a bunch of teenagers and adults attack a 12 year old.
* I believe TTK has proof to show Lazer and I are different people because about 6 of us play at the same school. so

* I do not know how helpful this is but
* **Facts Everyone Should Know**
* Lem0nland91112(me) helping guard the miners when RK was being freed in no way represented Arx(I was the only one from Arx there) therefore it is unjust coming to Arx and killing defenseless people. 
* Everything owed to my little brother is listed in screenshot evidence and considering the way Eagles is acting I doubt my bro will ever get it. 
* It is quite pathetic that these guys say and or think they are helping people after actions like this.
* I will never pay any reparations to Eagles or his guys.
* I will continue doing everything I can to bring them to justice. 

* **probably forgot a lot because the post was rushed so ask any questions**

duplicatas - Positronic 

Now as you can see from the above with regards to myself and the accusations made against me by NJpalms you can see why he was told to leave Black Stone Keep and was not welcome

When he broke into Black Stone Keep to pearl myself and xXTB he had never been inside the keep before and neither had cliff

The other players involved in this group have come forward so far but now that we know who the rest are it makes perfect sense since they all hangout in mumble together for the most part and have close ties with each other on the server.

If we look at positronic first it has been noted before the incident where he actually had the pearl of Duplictas and released him "" by mistake ""

TeaJizzle is the most disappointing of the group after speaking to him numerous times and listening to him constantly defend the above individuals beyond the realms of any sane individual

I have been a target by these individuals I believe because of my prior association with the jacks and the fact that they think I may rebuild my new town in the same way and perhaps effect the power base they have erected around them selves

It is well known I have close ties to the LSIF and that I'm more than willing to take in anyone who has no claims against them/reformed and paying them off as long as they are willing to abide by the rules I have laid out. 

As I said in my last thread Th3Joker_ infiltrated my group and after my main account rkwildcard was pearled he attacked lalleholm pearled him and gave him to the above group.

So they have spent quite some time it would seem planning this.....

And while I have not posted any evidence at all it will be published by the source who informed me of this

So the question is what are we going to do about it? I for one have no interest in remaining pearled at the hands of these griefers and there allies any longer.

I have taken the opportunity to re-publish the journal here on the subreddit in .pdf format for popular readership. I have also broadened the scope of the content to include analytical pieces about the societies of civcraft, and histories of the server.

I should note what I envision from this publication: I'd like it to be a pseudo-intellectual thing, ""Our backstory is based on history, not fiction."" Indeed this current iteration of *Revolutionary Science* should do the same. Moreover, the publication should serve as a culture and community builder, in other words creating or supplementing the current sense of community on the server in a reflexive sense. But it is also partly tongue and cheek with some roleplaying mixed in.

With that said, and the reader can expect some thought provoking and inspiring reads, including:

* A Communist Analysis of the HCF Invasion and its effects on the Power Structure of the Server - drafted by Synthion
* A Marxist-Tolkienian Analysis of the HCF Conflict - authored by bodhidharma
* A Reflection on the Accuracy of the Modeling of the Server - authored by Tambian Sinclair
* A Durkheimian Analysis of the Server's Division of Labour using the LSIF as a case study - authored by aMerce; and
* a personal retelling of server history authored by bobpndrgn

So you can expect a very interesting read with this one.

What I'm expecting by releasing this post is three things: firstly to advertise the publication, however. Civcraft is a drama machine, regardless.

Thirdly I'd like to open the call for papers to the general public for the reasons mentioned above. If you have a novel perspective on the server (such as bopndrgn's) or a unique perspective of the recent HCF conflict

After talking with a lot of players and trying to take in as much feedback as possible

I've heard some people's suggestions for potential machines they would like to see in CivTest (for now at least)

-----------------------

**Super Furnaces:** The ability to construct a large furnace that would take a particular type of fuel (preferably a material that is under-used at the moment to stimulate the economic desire for it). Then, smelt them quicker then a normal furnace, and then place the smelted materials in the 'output' chest. So, as you can see, a super furnace. It would be more expensive/complicated/difficult to build then a regular furnace, but it would smelt quicker and would allow for more large-scale smelting projects, since you can just load a double chest full of the materials you want to smelt, and then let it go until it's finished and all the smelted materials are in the chest.

**Auto Farmer:** The idea behind this machine is still very very rough. However, see a light go on and know that their farm is ready to harvest, etc.

**Poor Mans Excavator:** The premise behind this is a (somewhat) cheap machine that players can build and place. Once they place and activate it, but the premise is that an efficient and smart player could use it to streamline their manual mining efforts to locate veins.

-------------------------------

These are all rough general ideas for potential machines, I hope you'll upvote it so I can see what players like the most depending on what was upvoted the most.

I hope everyone is as excited to add more complexity

Well you got one. 

Players who have been here since the beginning, now retreat. Beaten. 

Players who went out of their way to help others

With the numerous amounts of differing ideologies, how trials should be setup, what makes a government's or state's claims legitimate. That was the beauty of Civcraft. Bickering and discussing and fighting. And then coming together when it was needed. Fighting together. 

The war itself has and will have numerous consequences. Consequences that aren't apparent to the average player. Will the victor have the patience to deal with the fallout of pearling numerous amounts of players? When they pearl innocents and griefers alike, who's small wealth were plundered, their shops vandalized, their homes destroyed. The nether roads? Are they going to police them and keep them safe? Or is it once again going to be easy pickings for seasoned raiders?

And what of the history of the server?

Before the war, the revival of Aristopolis, the rise and fall and rise of Augusta? The Pumpkin Jacks? Occupy Columbia? SEA, Communa, Havana? Haste? Infinius? The death of Lazuli, and the collaps of Columbia? Haven, Atmora, the Citadel, and the rise of the HCF

With this new history, pros and cons, liked and disliked will be forgotten. Cities with their long histories will be abandoned. Eventually, far into the future, they will get bored. And soon enough, the lands will be empty.

That is my dark prophecy. A song no one will sing. A song of cobble and lava. ",self,t5_2tm1t,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Civcraft/comments/15qkx3/a_song_of_cobble_and_lava/
