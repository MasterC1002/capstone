1329731144.0,pxmj9,The basics. Pony anatomy and undersketching.  ,viwrastupr,160,30,60,"Hello everypony.  [](/flutteryay ""Its time for another tutorial with your second favorite mod

Ponies are put together with an undersketch.  What's an undersketch?  [Well, it is supposed to, its not the final piece.  You see, what an undersketch does is provide the *foundation* on which the rest of the pony's body, placement, angles, proportions

Now let's take a closer look at that undersketch.  A pony body is made up of two ***intersecting*** circles.  A larger one for the rump and a smaller one for the chest.  Now what about the limbs, you can figure out the placement and proportions of the legs and their joints.  

By doing these simple few lines and circles, recorrect... got it.  But how?"")

Let's take the back legs for instance.  They have an angle that is difficult for most to see on their first few pony arts.  Look at [the angle the back line of the back leg is making in these pictures](http://imgur.com/a/vzBB8).  It comes out.  *Not in*.  Out.  In all flatfooted situations in the show this is the case.  **Back legs are neither straight nor forward, it leads the viewer into the body instead of down away from it.  

Now that we know this, in order to make sure you're getting the angle right hold a pencil up to the reference and measure angles between various outside points.  Part of the undersketch can be mapping out these angles.  This really helps you to nail placement and proportions.  [](/fluttershh ""This doesn't seem so bad... wait, is this how we recorrect?"")

A quick interlude here about the hoof joint.  Look again at that album of screenshots.  The hoof joint is not straight down (contrary to vertrev's guide).  Hooves have a tilt to them that adds an extra bit of flourish to the pony leg curve and allows them to move anatomically.  Keep this in mind

Now let's move on to eyes.  For a lot of people

Wait... what the heck is that, even if just a sliver.  This is true in humans too.  Unless we're looking down, far to the side or are Pinkie Pie excited, the tippy top of your iris is covered up by the eyelid.  

What else did I do there?  I changed all sorts of things around.  The hooves are longer, so use it as a general guide and fix the placement and proportions to fit your guiding lines.  Bigger, smaller, different angle or different curve.  With a reference and guiding lines in tow it becomes all the more easier.  

For completeness's sake, and some amount of advice, you'll get there."")  

Some notes on pony proportions and general anatomy tips:  

* Their bodies are tiny.  Two intersecting circles after all.  

* They are very tall (taller than their body is long).  And their necks are quite short in most circumstances.

* Their hair takes up a huuuuuge amount of space.  Poofy hair.  POOF!  People usually make their OC's without poof and with humanized hair.  This makes me a sad pony... don't make me a sad pony.  Be aware.  Spread the poof.  

* A pony's jawline (the part below the mouth) changes.  While in general a pony [has a flat and horizontal jawline](http://imgur.com/H2V1m) when their mouth's are open

* Ponies have very small and rounded muzzles.  There is no point at the end and to make a point draws attention away from the eyes in a way that is very... sad.  They're also barely there

* Their ears are not a triangle like a cat's
[](/twismile ""So very much to learn!"")
* Pony eyes are quite distinct.  They are elliptical, but not height.  Check out the twismile emote.  Her far eye is very thin, and her near eye not a circle, but an interesting series of curves... Hence why we map things out.  

Now, the way their front hooves and legs bend, how to map out eyes and to never fear correction and also a lot of anatomy.  That's a lot of pony and there's always more.  So as always, feel free to ask questions, voice concerns, make jokes or quietly reply.  [](/fluttershy ""Oh my... there's just to much...

For ease of use I've compiled every image I'm going to use in [this Imgur album](http://imgur.com/a/LqREG)

Let's get started! Pencils and paper ready

___

**[Image One](http://i.imgur.com/DmJMr.jpg) - The Circles.**

[](/rb11 ""Easy-peasy."") Here, and the one further back and slightly larger is the rump circle.

* Measure the size of the chest circle with the head circle; you should find that it's about 2/3 the head circle.

* The top of the rump circle should also be about in-line with the bottom of the head circle. Go ahead

* Notice how both circles overlap. The body is a lot smaller than you think. The width of both circles together should be about 1 1/3 the head circle

___

**[Image Two](http://i.imgur.com/hZtgJ.jpg) - Body**

[](/b24 ""Ah'm followin' so far..."")Here, specifically the neck/chest and the back/rump. Look at the chest. It's pretty far in from the chest circle, right? The circles are *not* absolute shapes to go from. Change whatever needs changing.

Here's where you start to draw the legs. Again, as you can judge from the reference, so don't take this as the absolutely correct way to draw them. Notice how the legs are pretty long and the body is pretty thin; I don't care. Neither should you. Right now, I just care about them being in the right place.

Also notice how I drew the closer two legs instead of the front two/rear two. More often than not, will be slightly shaded.

___

**[Image Three](http://i.imgur.com/R6vYX.jpg) - Body: Refinement**

[](/b07 ""Uh

* (1) Do you see that line? Yes, faze the leg out of view, look *though* it. It's just one curve.

* (2) I've said the body was too thin and the legs too long, and so the whole composition is thrown off. This is the main reason new artists' pieces look 'wrong' or 'off'. Stop, take a step back and assess the piece so far. It will save you either a lot of time and effort later, or a lot of grief. either way, it's a bonus.

So what do we have so far? We've almost got a basic pony! Just one leg... I hate that leg. *The far rear leg*. I despise it so. But wait! How do we know it's fine to move on? That's right; We *measure*! That head circle is still clearly visible without any annoying ears or muzzles in the way

___

**[Image Four](http://i.imgur.com/CfObB.jpg) - Head: The 'Cross'**

[](/b05 ""That's not helpful, but this is 3/4 view! *Why is this artistic noob giving me irrelevant advice?* Because, it's not irrelevant. No, you can't use this to place the muzzle or eye, but the ear can still be placed. Pretend this is a compass, the ear normally joins at points NE and E, so let's try that.

___
**[Image Five](http://i.imgur.com/n0mra.jpg) - Head: The Ear**

[](/c04 ""What."")There's nothing to really measure the ear against - Or is there? The points. Draw a line from point NE straight to the right, and copy the length passed the intersection. *That's complicated!* Sorry, look at the ear, you'll see what I mean. The top point is directly above E and the furthest part of the curve is directly inline with NE.

___

**[Image Six](http://i.imgur.com/nelG5.jpg) - Head: The muzzle and further eye**

[](/a05 ""Ah know this part! Easy-peasy, I've drawn an 'X'. This is the start of the muzzle. Start here if you're not already doing that in your drawings. ALWAYS. then curve to 'Triangle', and then to 'Square'. This muzzle is pretty poor and I correct it later, but this is the general shape. Experiment. That eraser's not going to sit there.

Starting back at the 'X', and down. As faces turn, on anything, the further eye is always squished, thinned, while the closer eye is more round. Normally, such as when drawing people, rounder eye, and I make it slightly thinner than this.

___

**[Image Seven](http://i.imgur.com/XcPR8.jpg) - Head: Closer Eye**

[](/e07 ""Teach us correctly, but I like to draw them level. This helps *me* find it's size, already knowing it's height and that it's supposed to be much thicker and rounder than the other eye, but it's merely how I approach the eyes. What definately happens, though, is that the bottom of this eye always falls beneath the tip of the muzzle. Get a ruler or something, make it horizontal and check If that's correct in your piece.

Notice how it's an oval, but this 'leaned-oval' style is true to pretty much every pony in the show.

___

**[Image Eight](http://i.imgur.com/ccqFq.jpg) - Hair placement**

[](/a00 ""Pfft. So hard."")Quickly make the general shape of the head mane/neck mane/tail. Just the vague shape of it, almost triangular neck mane while mine is a quick triangle-circle hybrid shape. Also the little points that curve round so awesomely aren't even in my shape. I've noted the points in the tail with little lines, though, while still keeping that basic round shape. The head mane stands too tall here, and the tail sticks out way too far and it overall quite bulky, but again, I took a step back and I *noticed* these things, after sketching, sketching some more

___

**[Image Nine](http://i.imgur.com/VX27N.jpg) - Refinement and Cleaning up**

[](/b01 ""Get out'a mah head!"")Stop right there, with the erasing/sketching I was talking about. I thought the tail was too bulky, so I trimmed it down. The hooves here angled strangely like she was standing on a hill, so I flattened the bottoms out. The haunches were really short and the flank came down really far, so I raised the hock (that little point at the back of the leg) to stomach-level. I added the little points and lines in her mane/tail. It is not as big a leap as you think. That far rear leg still looks wrong, but I just hate that leg with a passion. The rump looked way too high, so I moved it down and in turn had to erase the whole refined tail and redraw it a little lower - no big deal. It looks correct now. The piece looks correct

___

[](/a03 ""And Ah didn't learn a thing!"")Well

1325323196.0,nxdpy,DON'T PANIC.  A drawing guide.  From beginner to expert and everything in between.,viwrastupr,95,14,14,"The number one and most important thing to remember when drawing is: **Art isn't made in a vacuum**.  Expecting to magically just know how to draw ponies without ever having copied a reference is like expecting to magically know math without instruction or books.  You'd have to create every single math theorum that everyone has ever made or you'd like to know from scratch.  It takes critiques

Taking criticism is hard.  I used to equate critiques as akin to putting one's face in a blender.  Now

There are many common problems

**1. Common thoughts**


a.  The Horizontal problem.  

All the other problems here come from this problem.  We all have a habit of wanting things to be straight, diagonal and curved lines are more dynamic and add movement and interest to a piece.  They aren't a goal necessarily, because too much can be a distraction.


b. Stiff

This is almost like the horizontal problem.  Making figures straight up and down (The legs go down


   c. Symmetry.

This is hard here because you're working from a cartoon and they're pretty symmetrical looking.  The same problem is here as the blocky figures.  Its just boring to look at.  Yep, put one leg at an angle, push an eye off into perspective, tilt things at an angle relative to other things or make an ear flop, make one smaller or more hidden.  

   d. Keep in mind

If the line for the hair coming down continues on through the face


  e. Never be afraid to ask for advice.

If you get frustrated.  If something looks off and you can't tell why.  For any reason.  This is the easiest way to never make the same mistake again.  


  f. If you know it looks off anatomically

This is




**2. On anatomy:**

   a.  **Use References**

This is The Best Way to Learn.  Copy from a screenshot (don't call the work yours of course).  You can't expect yourself to know how it looks without having drawn how it looks.  


   b. Pony legs are rarely if ever straight and never straight up and down this misconception comes from 1.a.

   c. Pony ears attach towards the back of the head

 
**3. Thinking like an artist**


   a. Art is **not** Precious.  

This is especially true when making art.  You're obviously already capable of drawing that thing you just drew, great!


   b. Art is fear.   

There is an excellent book [shown here](http://www.amazon.com/Art-Fear-Observations-Rewards-Artmaking/dp/0961454733) called Art &amp; Fear.  For those who are frustrated with art or find themselves bogged down or intimidated by art


  c. Forcing yourself to make art in a vacuum, references and creative exercises is really really bad.  

I can not be redundant enough about this.  


   d. Set long term goals.  

This is for those serious about learning


**4. Exercises you can do.**

a. [How to measure and compare](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/prx47/rabbis_guide_to_the_perplexed_or_how_to_measure/)(by dispatchrabbi) To get angles, you'll notice that it becomes a lot easier to correct mistakes that 'just don't look quite right.'  This takes a lot of the guesswork out and makes proportions and angles much easier.  

Do this everywhere.  The angle from the ear tip to the rump.  From eye to muzzle.  From front to back leg.  Between any two arbitrary points or to get the angle and/or placement of a limb or eye or tail.  Absolutely positively everywhere.  And then erase.  Mark

There has been some confusion on this, that you are measuring on your reference.  Bring the pencil over to your piece without changing its angle.  Compare what the pencil is to what you have.  Correct with said pencil.  Repeat.

b. [How to gesture

c. [Shading

d.  [How to critique and how to take critique](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/p93po/how_to_critique_for_critics_and_artists_alike/).  Artists and critiquers should take a look at this.  It doesn't only have etiquitte

e. [The basics.  A guide on pony anatomy and undersketching](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/pxmj9/the_basics_pony_anatomy_and_undersketching/).  Exactly what it says.  It is a good place for those who really want to capture what an MLP pony looks like.  

f. [Composition.](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/qd2uq/composition_how_does_your_drawing_feel_to_look_at/)  This guide is a compacted version of 2d design.  Really good for inspiration.

[](/twibeam ""Meetups!"") To be frank we need a lot more guides.  I've got more in the woodworks

1.  Which guides do you want or would you use or do you think the sub needs more?  This decides which are written first.  Also what more guides can you think of?  What is left out and needs to be covered.

2. I don't have infinity to spend on the sub anymore... sadness

* **Bonus:**  On the plus side and counter-intuitively I will have more time for meetups which I would like to schedule for some time in the coming 2 months.  This post is also for that.  List your city!  Me?  Denver, time, and funds, will travel.  We can get together, draw art, do some more involved in person helping and go out for food.  Because food.  

Guides yet to come:

* Portraying Concept in Art. Examples: Forlorn lover. Hatred.

* Twilight's Creative Checklist.  Alternate title: **Being free in art.  Anatomy

* More shading. [I've got this comment set](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/q3k7b/bi8_second_verse_ready_to_be_ripped_to_shreds/c3ugtx8) that I need to turn into a guide.  

* Utilizing references.  There's a lot that goes in here.  Help me help you.  

* Identifying Compositional Awkwardness:  Shakyness.  Tension.  Consistency of style.  Consistency of perspective.  Consistency of anatomy v. show/reality.  All anatomy points there and connected correctly.  This one is really about tips and tricks and defining certain things to help you see better.  There is a lot more to it.

1344509730.0,xxmkm,Thursday Weekly [Lesson] 1. Sketching Technique. ,mynameischumpy,56,11,140,"*EDIT: Although this is a weekly 'Thursday' lesson

[Lesson 4 is here.](http://redd.it/z3bne)

[Lesson 5 is here.](http://redd.it/zhek6)

[Lesson 6 is here.](http://redd.it/zulhs)

Welcome to the lesson post number one! (You should probably use [RES](http://redditenhancementsuite.com/) for this. Lots of picture links in this one.)

These lesson posts are meant to teach you guys the fundamentals of art. Note that whether you’re already experienced or just starting out

*The ☨ labels are footnotes for your further reading. I've not many words to put in this post so everything is in the comments.*

*I’ll be here to try to answer as many questions you guys have

---
**The Undersketch**

When starting art, you can afford to change things at a moments notice, so - 

Use this to your advantage! As a beginner, *no line is permanent, and you should not hesitate to change things if they look wrong*. [☨^1](http://i.imgur.com/3Lsq4.jpg)

**Swooshy Lines**

[](/c28 ""That isn't even a word!"") In its essence, long swooshy* strokes rather than short scratchy ones. I feel this a very important part of sketching. 

[Loose swooshy lines by TexDraws](http://24.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lyh4dkXmLm1qfj55yo1_1280.png). 

Lots of beginners wrongly use short lines for sketching, or short and timid, it will reflect in your work. 

[Linetype Examples](http://i.imgur.com/l8o6I.jpg)

Also

---
**ACTIVITY TIME**

Nuff talk. Lets have a short break here and practice how to actually make swooshy

Now

If you’ve got a sketchbook or a nice piece of A4 paper

What you’ll want to do is use your *shoulder* to draw those circles. Sound scary? It’s really not. Think of it as a [‘wax on

You should end up with something like this: [Link](http://i.imgur.com/UAWAu.jpg/).

Remember, wax off.

*Post the finished sheet in the comments so I know you’re not cheating.*

---

Had fun? Carrying on -

**General to Specific**

With sketches, precise lines*. With general lines, you should be thinking ‘This leg *kinda* goes here, but i’ll be able to change this if it looks weird. This hair *roughly* should flow this way.’ 

The idea behind this is to get your idea down on paper quick. People tend to be afraid of a blank canvas. Its so full of potential, it’s a lot less intimidating. You get a better idea of what the final piece will be as you put down more lines. This takes a lot of the fear out of starting to draw. [General lines example](http://i.imgur.com/rmJzI.jpg) [☨^2](http://i.imgur.com/i8Rss.jpg)

When you’ve got the general lines down you can move on to more specific lines. ‘This leg should be right here. This mess of lines is an ear.’ [Specific lines example](http://i.imgur.com/FiNSS.jpg) *Keep in mind that this is still not your finished product.* If something looks wrong

**Messiness.**

Be messy! How messy you’ll want to be is up to you, you. Remember that the idea is merely your idea fleshed out on paper, and not your final piece. Look at how messy [Lauren (Faust)’s sketches were](http://fc01.deviantart.net/fs71/i/2011/268/9/4/big_baddie_by_fyre_flye-d4axlhy.jpg).

[☨^3](http://i.imgur.com/dAhTQ.jpg)

**But hey

Ah

The problem with this is that these lines don’t come magically to them. They are able to draw these because they’ve done them a thousand times before. Going straight to clean linework without an under-sketch *and* no prior experience is bad plan. If things look out of place, nope.

While we’re on the topic of experience

---
**Video:**

 [Egophiliac sketch](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5NS_SAq_HM&amp;feature=plcp)

Notice how she uses those ginormous loose lines to plan out her picture

If you want to see more sketch videos

---

**TLDR; The essence of sketching**

- The sketch is not your final product. Nothing is permanent. Make mistakes. Change. Adapt.

- The sketch is a quick way to get your idea down on paper. Big

- Allow yourself to be messy.

- Long swooshy lines. With short scratchy lines your picture loses flow.


**Pony sketching**

‘Okay I get it’, you say.

I’d go deeper into this sketching ponies topic, look at the footnote comment.☨^Anatomy

Shapes are what ponies are made of.  

[](/a12 ""Not marshmallows?!"")

[](/ajhappy ""Nope. Common mistake."") 

The basis of any pony is [three circles](http://i.imgur.com/KBPGU.jpg). Where your ears, tail, and eyes will be positioned will be based off of these circles. The magic of these circles is that you can move them around along with your legs, and you will have different poses. Witchcraft, really.

Along with these circles, bones are important.

*Even as I say this, but move on after you’ve got a good grasp of pony anatomy.*

---
**ACTIVITY TIME**

I’d like you to sketch out a pony. Use guide circles

Now, however the difference is that Stup uses primarily long flowy lines while sunshine uses quick, bold strokes.

Hence

What I *don’t* want you to do is make your sketch overtly clean. Refinement comes later. If its messy, so it really doesn’t matter who’s better or worse.

----------

**Twilight says: STUDY**

-----------

[](/sp)[](/twipride ""Study!"")[](/sp)Form and styles are good areas to focus on, drawing it together."")

Everything comes down to doing studies. The different types of studies help you with different aspects of art. A 'study' means finding reference(s) that exemplifies well what you're trying to work on

Studies that bring more form and shape to the characters:

* **Volume studies.** Volumes mean using cubes

* **Anatomy studies**. Not just of show ponies, muscle structure, how things attach. [Stuff like this](http://cutiehorn.tumblr.com/post/39217148873/horse-anatomy-post). 

* **Action lines.** Action lines help your characters feel more dynamic

* **Expressions.** [This is the best guide ever for expressions](http://tracyjb.deviantart.com/art/Lackadaisy-Expressions-193978013)

---------------

Studies that help you to flush out a personal style: 

* **Other artists.** Find artists that you like (and maybe some you don't) and do studies of their work. [](/ppseesyou ""Claiming a copy study as your own work is punishable by death."")[](/twistare ""Death? But... that's..."")[](/pinkamina ""Forever!"") Now you may be thinking 'but I want my *own* style'. Well, but until you've drawn some you'll have little clue how to draw them. What is 'style' is the combination of all the stuff you've studied in the past. Doing some studies of other artists helps you to build up an epic **library of knowledge** to draw from.

'Other artists' is big. It means: pony artists, real life, art movements, impressionist artists, concept artists, real life, that one guy who you like the hairstyle of his anime characters and you'd like to bring it to ponies and anything else that comes to mind. It also means you can break things down and just study the composition of this guy

* **Sketching studies** All too often us artists obsess over making every composition perfect, to help everything along, each of these studies can be quick, messy and incomplete. [Like this](http://sta.sh/0sim5fzk66t). Doing sketches lets you learn the above bullets quickly and without all the fuss. [](/ppreference ""sketchy, sketch a sketch."")

Unlike studying math or history or pretty much anything else, don't make it perfect and work for general ideas, not specific one time only solutions."")

---------------

All studies are based upon the same principle. **Art isn't made in a vacuum**. No one makes art devoid of context

1. Planning stuff

2. Elements of placement

3. Methods to make

[](/twismug ""Art is a lie that tells the truth."") 
There are many different ways to set up a composition and planning can mean the difference between something being anatomically accurate or being interesting to look at. **The purpose of this guide is to teach you to plan and play with composition and how**  There's a whole bunch here

-------------

**Part 1:** A lot of the planning stuff

* Variety How many different elements do you want?  How different should they be?  Adding variety to a piece gives different kinds of attention to different parts. [Notice how each of the limbs on this Twilight are going a different direction and her body is facing a different direction than her head](http://imgur.com/TXR0z).  Variety creates interest.  This is not only true of positioning, mark making... a lot of stuff

* Conformity Adding conformity adds stability, but for newer artists it is best to play with diagonals and actions, try to get things interesting."")otherwise known as the most boring things in art.  To be avoided in the beginning, to be used only with intention.  [This shows very well how a vertical line can be used for stability and emotion](http://imgur.com/LNk2Z).  

* Balance[](/twisquint ""What?"") Is there as much on the left as there is on the right?  No? (good) Then why?  What is it doing?  Something to ask yourself during the creation process.  Colors, busyness of lines, **placement**.  All these things are a factor of balance. A [good contrast of two values on two separate sides](http://imgur.com/Kd7NC) is a neat balance, but sometimes you don't want it even.

* Emphasis Defined by balance. Where do you want the viewer's eye to look?  Is there contrast there? Is there an eye? Is it busy?  Is there a different color?  Where do the lines point? Then how do we know to look there?  [What is the first thing you notice with this piece](http://imgur.com/u6dvS)?

* Contrast Tells us where things are different.  You may say that 'duh things are different because they're in another spot'. Well

* Rhythm Repeated elements

* Repetition What's the difference between repetition and rythm? [A pattern is much more alike than a rythm](http://imgur.com/EN5j2)

* Scale How big the pony is makes it more or less important to the composition.  [Notice how the background characters here are smaller than Dash](http://imgur.com/XRdAh)

* Figure/Ground relationship. Separating your figure from the background is ludicrously important.  It tells us what is figure and what is not, value and color.  [This piece is separation by value](http://imgur.com/lnt0f)

* Direction -gaze, pointing out the beauty of the branches above](http://imgur.com/4507R)

* Movement/Action Diagonal lines help with these a lot

* Faces and emotions [](/twibeam ""Emotion me!"")Not technically a part of 2d design.  But  important.  Our eyes identify faces fist and start there. [Emotions make or break how we view the character](http://imgur.com/zAG9j).  Also emotions aren't be dependent on the face alone. [Value and texture also play an important role](http://imgur.com/wZu7q).

* Concept.  -Again, implied stuffs.  Things that give an attachment to a piece that isn't emotion.  [This is a piece that does a good job of combining both emotion and concept without face](http://imgur.com/ZfKeZ).  

-----------

**Part 2:** Elements of placement

* Continuance Intended or unintended.  Orientation/Implied Lines. When you have a line that flows directly into another line or a place of contrast that does the same, resting on the eye easily](http://imgur.com/X607r)

* Tension When two objects are very close or an object is very close to the edge it creates tension.  Usually this is something to be wary of

* Looseness/vastness  How much space are you allowing for the figure? [This shows very well the impact of space](http://imgur.com/k6Tsl)

* Crowdedness  Can add interest

* Asymmetry/Symmetry.  Asymmetry provides interest.  Symmetry provides order.  Both are good at times

* The rule of thirds -It is a way that artists divide the composition into three equal parts.  Placing important points like the horizon line

* Central composition. [This Derpy provides a beautiful example](http://imgur.com/QlUak).  This doesn't really qualify for its own bullet but I love Derpy and this is an excellent composition

-----------

**Part 3**  Methods to make

[](/twistare ""What do you mean there's more?"")

* Lines Known as paths

* Shapes! An area. This is what I'm referring to when I say shadow shapes.  Shapes are their own volume and learning to create with shapes pushes you into learning to think in 3 dimensions. [This Rainbow is made with shapes and not a line brush. Active](http://imgur.com/HqyUe)

* Value light and dark.  How bright do you want your composition to be?  How dark?  At first people make things even

[](/twicrazy ""Colors. I thought I was almost done and there's a guide within a guide. Jerk"")* Colors basic color theory [as seen in this awesome guide](http://purplekecleon.deviantart.com/gallery/?q=color#/d31xj5t).  Color is a class of its own. [Take this megasweet piece for example](http://imgur.com/vHZGZ). Color makes it pop

* Space Height

* Texture. Texture is very active and draws the eye in to visit all the parts of the piece.  It is a good cookie (explained later).  [This piece would be different if it weren't for the textured background](http://imgur.com/tliX0).

* Text.  -[This text is awesome](http://imgur.com/Rn493)

* Cookies. These are a reward to your audience for looking.  It can be anything from a rich texture to an easter egg. You don't notice this on first glance, the wearing of the hat, the holding hooves. [This piece is full of happy cookies](imgur.com/NH9Uj).

As you can see from the various examples

These videos are an absolute gold mine of awesome information

[](/c20 ""I really need to remember to start bookmarking some of these things."")

Well, the animation becomes vague and confusing. I learned this lesson early on while I was constructing combat cycles in class; when you actually *fight* you don't want to anticipate your motion (otherwise you get clobbered). My first tries at animating were muddy and dull due to my brain insisting that I not include large anticipatory gestures.

[](/a22 ""Derp"")

Anyway, *strangely enough*, we as artists are trying to put together (still) pieces of art that *are also interesting to look at*. Hopefully you see where I'm going with this.

[](/c02 ""See

I'm going to use dispatchrabbi as an example here, reaching waaaaay out for something. The reference is [here](http://www.bmloeffelman.com/pictures/MLP/SwBRef_stretching.jpg) (apologies for the small size). Sweetie Bell not only has a very definite line stating her intent, but it's further reinforced by the exaggerated stretching of her body; she's reeeeeally reaching for whatever it is.

**Where we are and where we're going**:

This sub.

We've got a [deviantart group too](http://mlpdrawingschool.deviantart.com/)! [](/fluttershy ""Join the group... that is... if you don't mind."") Which needs some love.

There are quite a few members with tumblr accounts

I would like to expand to youtube as soon as I get settled... in late August.  

**What happens here**:

We critique pony art!  To help all the peoples get better at art

The sub answers questions!  Not sure where to go from here?  How to fix something?  How to do something?  Have any question?  Make a self post and we'll do our best to answer.

We hang out! June 23rd &amp; 24th is official mlpdrawingschool hangout weekend.  The official official meetup is in Chicago, there are lounge posts.  **The lounge posts are largely unregulated** in that they don't have to be about pony art and anyone can post one.  However, discussion questions are just about mandatory to get the conversations started.


**Who does what**:

This sub is a community.  By no means do the mods have any real authority or responsibilities more than just enforcement.  

Everypony submits and everypony critiques.  This means that if you see something off in someone's post

**The purpose of this post**:

Voice your concerns.

Voice your ideas.  What could be improved here?  What do we need?  Something I'd like to mention is that there were a few less welcomes to the new peoples as a whole while I was gone and this made me sad... just because it's a critique doesn't mean it's not fun.  

Voice your questions. [](/loveme ""You... are going to... SPEAK UP!"")[](/fluttershh ""...please."")

What I need from you:  **References.**  I know there are more than 100 ponies in the show

I'd also like some conversation.  Questions on art are welcome and critique can happen

This is a challenge

1311318710.0,iwmd8,Stencil Art Tutorial: Part 1,The_Velour_Fog,48,11,15,"***Yes

Hello, and turning it into a final piece of stencil art. This part of the tutorial will focus on materials and prepping your first project.

First off, with a bit about each one.

* Spray Paint: The most obvious part of spray paint art is the paint. There are many kinds available. Finding the colors you want can be tough depending on what you have available in your area. Home Depot and WalMart carry a good stock of paint colors for around three to six dollars a can. Art stores in your area may have a much wider selection of colors in higher end graffiti paints, but it falls into the $10 a can category.

* Canvas: I am going to assume you want to paint on something to hang up

* Stencil Material: There are a ton of options here. Regular computer paper can work fine, transparency film, the list can go on. Print onto the material if you can, or tape the printer paper onto the second material and cut it out from there. I like to use [National Geographic Adventure Paper](http://www.amazon.com/National-Geographic-Adventure-Paper/dp/B00005OMZ9/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1311315295&amp;sr=8-1). It holds up well to multiple paintings, cuts really well, and can be taped and removed without tearing. However, it is expensive.

* Blade: I use a pretty standard Xacto blade

* Masking Material: The stencil can only cover so much of your canvas. I use Scotch blue painters tape and regular weight printer paper for most of my other masking to keep the paint from going where I don't want it. I sometimes use some adhesive to hold down tiny details that want to move around. I either use acid free rubber cement or 3M Super77 adhesive spray. For both just a tiny bit will go a long way in making your paintings look nice.

* Painting area: Good ventilation is primary here. I paint in my garage with the door open. Cover the ground so you don't get paint everywhere. Here are some pics of my painting area. Don't be like me

* Other Stuff: Many times you will need to hold a stencil with your free hand to get clean edge lines. For this just use rubber gloves

That about covers it for materials. Choosing the image you want to make can be one of the harder parts. I got to cheat for this since I asked for suggestions from Mittens2248 on what he wanted to see get made. We decided on [this image of Fluttershy](http://fc07.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2011/108/3/8/fluttershy_vector_by_issyrael-d3ec9yo.png).
I liked this one since it was funny

Prepping for making the stencils:
I decided to capture my screen as I worked in Photoshop prepping the image and talking about layers and composition. So here is your first of two opportunities to watch me talk to myself for a few minutes. [Watch it here!](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=25Z4SX8xECQ)


The next tutorial about cutting the stencils will be out in a few days

Thanks to Mittens2248 for suggesting I do the tutorial and thebestwes for letting me co-opt his drawing school subreddit.

[](/twiquery)**Question One: ""Wait

Oh look, yes? No. Not to sound like I'm raising a barrier between lurkers and submitters but joining up merely adds a 'one' to the number of subscribers. We can't see your name or account page or anything, we don't even know if *you've* subscribed because there isn't a list of subscribers. You're merely 'following' the subreddit anonymously. Harsh, right? Probably. But don't get disheartened by my assholy-ness my faceless friend - I, like other member of the sub, would be extremely happy if you announce yourself with a drawing, sketch, whatever. You're subscribed to a pony sub - love and tolerance come with the package, soon...
___
[](/twipride)**Question Two for lurkers: What

`

[](/twicrazy)**Answer:** ... May I cordially introduce - The Critique Hammer. I just know you two will get along swimmingly - You'll be seeing a lot of each other.

There is a number of people here who submit awesome pieces of art that took days

Okay

They are critiqued; their simpler mistakes (relevant to the piece) and more personal flaws (their traits as an artist) are brought forth like a seemingly harsh, being told your flaws outright is immeasurably more productive and beneficial to you than being told you did well. Of course we're not against saying how good you are but let me take a useful sentence from the sidebar; **""Praise is good, but only in moderation.""**

[](/c11) Let me explain: You know about your better traits. That's why their your better traits, soon you'll become so good that they can't pick out anything wrong with it! How good does that sound! (Though Viw will probably STILL be able to point SOME kind of error out... )
___
This is all from my head and from watching the activity on the sub over the last few weeks

* 1300+ subscribed

* ~200 voters (highest post has 50 upvotes. Seriously? Only 50 people out of 1300+ have an opinion on something?)

* ~50 rare submitters (posted at least one piece ever).

* ~30 casual submitters (posts every now and then

* ~20 active submitters (regularly posts content

* ~15 in streams (Viw's

That's less than 100 submitters - ever - to more than 1300 subscribers.

That's the same as over 5 to 1.

And that's bad - No, just sitting right there in front of the screen reading this, is - well, doing just that. Sitting in front of the screen, not becoming active. I get that time zones can get in the way of people being in the streams, but if you go into the new que after 24 hours only about 10 new submissions have surfaced. Up to 10 different people out of clear-over 1300.
___
[](/c21)**Question Three for lurkers: Feel discouraged?**

A little extra about critiques - When someone gives you a critique

[](/a23)Hey! Hey hey! See that? The background? Your drawing could be there too, right? So everyone who merely walks in on our sub will see how awesome you are!

People are starting to have flairs next to their name, some are jokes, perhaps it signifies them as a regular on the sub. Whatever the reason one gets a flair for, I'm feeling that people may see these people and think we're a 'group', making others feel kind of ostracized or distant from the community. Don't feel like that. We're here to help, have fun, chat, we even have our own [Lounge!](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/qmqp7/) I'm assuming this is a weekly thing
___

[](/b20) **DO IT! DO IT FILLY!**

[](/b16)A good way to introduce yourself and meet fellow artists here in the sub, introduce yourself, maybe post a link to a drawing? It's fine, we won't bombard you with soul-crushing critiques this time round.

[](/a24) Okey dokey lokey
Are you going to post, but [the choice is yours.](http://images1.fanpop.com/images/photos/1900000/Morpheus-Red-or-Blue-Pill-the-matrix-1957140-500-568.jpg)
___
**[edit] From Living_Dead:**

&gt;A little insight to how the flair system works. I upvote every submitted piece of art on this sub (or atleast try). With the power of res I know how many upvotes I have given someone. Generally when you hit 3 you get me off my flank to spend 13 seconds giving you flair. Now for the people who have odd names next to them is either I thought it was funny or was drunk

[](/a14)I guess there's less need to feel distant because of flairs now

I'm posting this at 3am

Since the sub has been growing so fast

For this next challenge I'd like to both expand our membership and challenge everypony here. So here's my proposal.

Think on a composition you'd like to make

Post progress shots here and ask for help and feedback along the way. If you get stuck, want a place to start, ask and the community as a whole shall oblige. That texture or style another artist does and you really want to do but you don't know how? Ask how and I'll do my best to help. From the painterly coloring style to a heavily textured style, to a clean, block style.  Anything you want to make a goal, now is the time to try it.  You never get there if you don't try.  

It won't be perfect

Once you have finished
Submit this awesome work to r/mylittlepony with a title beginning with: ""On behalf of r/MLPdrawingschool"" and then however the heck you want to title it from there is fine. Here's the catch. **Whomsoever's post gets the most comments gets to design the 1000 members background banner for the sub!** (without soliciting and minus your own

Most importantly this challenge is about proving to yourself that you are making progress.  You can push yourself to great heights.  Those amazing artists out there?  Those artists can be you.  

For your inspiration

[The simplicity of this style](http://i.imgur.com/XERrm.jpg) is capable of great depth of emotion.   Pic by kelou4.

[The atmosphere and texture in this piece](http://rizcifra.deviantart.com/art/quot-You-remind-me-of-someone-quot-212495190) is eloquent and fits perfectly with the concept.

[Some rather standard coloring](http://bioniclegahlok.deviantart.com/art/Twilight-Sparkle-FiM-253904407?q=boost%3Apopular%20twilight%20sparkle&amp;qo=47) can be pushed.

[Or you can go a little painterly/cartoon](http://harwicks-art.deviantart.com/art/Know-When-to-Fold-Em-274057023).

[Or you can even go full on paint](http://kp-shadowsquirrel.deviantart.com/art/Applejack-Gala-Portrait-279747288).

[You can go simple](http://bamboodog.deviantart.com/art/Feathering-Twilight-266886552?q=boost%3Apopular%20twilight%20sparkle&amp;qo=304).

[As always

I would like the artists of /r/MLPdrawingschool to draw sketches for the vectorers at /r/MLPvectors to finish in vector!

Here's how it works...

* We're going to use this thread to find partners. Sketch artists respond to this thread directly

* If you think you can handle more than one partner, please! (You may do one on each 'side' as well, if you like.)

* Once you have a partner, backgrounds, shading, or whatever you feel comfortable with.

* Sketch artists - post your sketch here for a quick critique before sending it off to your partner to finish!

* Vector artists - remember to post your vector to /r/MLPvectors when you're done!

* Tips for sketch artists: Try to keep your sketches clean, that's vector artist's job this time!

* Tips for vector artists: Use a [color guide](http://i1.minus.com/ibgWupUf0REKZI.png). The sketch will probably not have thick colored

This is a complete restructuring of the sub as we know it.  Please leave your feedback on what you would like

There's been some discussion lately for improving the sub as a whole.  This is your community so I want your feedback before implementing any large changes.  What's been proposed:

-------------

**Self post only**

This sub is not about karma.  At all.  They distract from the larger issue of learning.  Also

-----------------------------

**Replacement of the bi-weeklys**

As they're structured now bi-weeklys are random and quite arbitrary in the lessons they teach.  There's no direction nor does it allow for users of all skill levels to incorporate their own ideas.  As such it has been proposed that weekly exercises take the place of bi-weeklys.  These exercises would be accompanied with guides that tell the artist what they can learn from the exercise as well as several different variations or a general goal to appeal to artists of all skill levels.  

These are not necessary every week.

---------------------------

**Branching out from ""only critique"" expectations**  

Whoever posts gets a critique

Discussion is where real improvement lies.  The issue here remains artists that post and run.  It's no fun for critics and it kills any sense of community.  

------------------------------------

**Welcoming the new**

This is important.  Critique has become dry and stale when the people posting it aren't that at all.  Talking about art and saying hello isn't a job.  Don't expect the world of yourself as a critic and fellow artist.  

I have no idea what can fix this

------------------

**Branching out from reddit**

Not something I'm for

Right outside of reddit now we do livestreams, an active chat room, and should get a youtube channel.  

------------------------------

**Bringing back the fun**

Where did it go?  A large part of this is my fault.  Too many dry critiques and dry posts.  But my real life prohibits fun right now (it's true

There was once an excitement to create and use our own emotes.  Now the regular ones are hardly used at all

What I'm wondering here is what do we do?  

-----------------

**Death of the project**

There's been no excitement

-----------------------

**New first stop guide**

This is about absolutely necessary.  The sidebar is cluttered and it's unclear where new artists need to go.  A guide needs to be created to help people see where they fit in the sub and if it is for them. 

A better

---------------------------

**Requiring new artists to throw up a tag** 

To show they're at least aware of where they're posting.  All too often new artists post and run

This is one possible solution for crit and run artists.  Thoughts or ideas?  

--------------

**Moving past ponies**

Not every piece of art made is made about or for ponies.  My questions are these:

Is the Thursday pony plus enough?

Are exercises and lessons that have nothing to do with ponies okay?  

What would you like for your non pony art?

--------------

What else could be changed or improved?  What sounds good to you and what sounds icky?

Everything here is a proposal

But I thought it would be good for others to see exactly what a gauntlet constitutes.

My initial assignments: ~ 1 hour a day. Work along with PK’s Color Guide

At least 3 speedpaints a week, colors, textures, etc. So, they each need to have purpose.

Sketch compositions and thumbnails - quick and dirty!

Draw from real life.

My colors are too segregated

The first few weeks were really just me getting used to working fast and loose (my first page of thumbnails was probably ~ an hour per thumbnail, and harmony. In addition I do lots of gesture drawing and (not enough) observational drawing.

Here’s Imgur links to my workload so far
**[Before](http://porkchopsammie.deviantart.com/art/New-Beginnings-349936293?q=gallery%3Aporkchopsammie%2F34324495&amp;qo=2) [the](http://porkchopsammie.deviantart.com/art/Twas-the-Night-Before-Christmas-345580952?q=gallery%3Aporkchopsammie%2F34324495&amp;qo=4) [gauntlet](http://porkchopsammie.deviantart.com/art/Idyllic-Afternoon-338933986?q=gallery%3Aporkchopsammie%2F34324495&amp;qo=8)

**Week 1**:

[pen doodled in SAI](http://i.imgur.com/8HhLrhc.jpg). My draftsmanship is terrible

[study in limited palette and simplicity](http://i.imgur.com/zoMM1BY.jpg).

[landscape thumbnails that missed the point](http://i.imgur.com/tZ2FsXS.jpg). Seriously

[more thumbs

[speedpainting from observation](http://i.imgur.com/t1R7t6v.jpg). 






**Week 2**: 

at this point I started collecting scraps onto one image for easier viewing.[week 2 
scraps](http://i.imgur.com/e4cahIa.jpg).

[thumbs from the animated short “The Reward”](http://i.imgur.com/tULq1uz.jpg). I tried to eyeball the colors

[pony faces from screenshots](http://i.imgur.com/z9nyjHc.png).

[speedpaint trying to de-segregate my colors](http://i.imgur.com/hOkSs53.jpg). This did end up being ~2, etc.

[some junky hatching](http://i.imgur.com/z0TIzxb.png). Only including this out of honesty.

**Week 3**:

[week 3 was frustrating. I left my comfort zone and couldn’t do anything right to save my life.](http://i.imgur.com/ewbK75n.png).

[random pencil doodlings](http://i.imgur.com/kE2yttH.jpg).

[tree](http://i.imgur.com/sCjoeho.jpg).

**Week 4**: 

[week 4 scraps](http://i.imgur.com/BDeFz7q.jpg). My mission this week was to steal palettes from other artists (bottom right is a Van Gogh, and letting myself just go nuts when sketching. Scribble around like a madman until a shape pops out.

[1st round of Pokemon color studies](http://i.imgur.com/4IbcYx6.jpg). I picked up my old copy of Pokemon and was inspired by all the different designs and color schemes to work with. Each of these is ~ 15 minutes? The idea was taken from one of Viw’s uploads, and 2) it shows how much of an impact color and light have on the same pose/drawing/scene.

[2nd round of pokeymons](http://i.imgur.com/G8rUHK4.png). I couldn’t get enough

[120 second figure drawings from thedrawingscript](http://i.imgur.com/n7xlU9M.jpg). Just good practice for eyeballing things

**Week 5**:

I’ll compile all the stuff I worked on and send it to Viw next Tuesday (I try to keep it to once a week so he’s not flooded). But here’s the first image of the week to show where I’m going.

[yet more pakeymons](http://i.imgur.com/jBB5N3Y.jpg). My goal here was to move past analogous color/temperature schemes, as well as incorporating more of a sense of background to the image. I’ll keep working on it. Again, unless otherwise noted, I try to keep everything very strictly in a 1 hour time limit for each image. In this case, I think I spend 10-20 minutes per panel.

So, because you can’t just blow off your studies (I mean, you can, but it means you’re a bad person).

1. [DON'T PANIC](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/nxdpy/)! This links to all the guides from shading to composition and goes over some ways to think about art.  

2. [Lesson 1](http://redd.it/xxmkm) sketching techniques.  This goes over how to approach ponies artistically and the general sketching process.  [Dispatchrabbi has also made this guide](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/prx47/) on measuring and comparing.  Great for proportions and anatomy and not having to resolve the same problem for the umpteenth time.  

-------

**General sub etiquette.**

* Read the guidelines in the sidebar. [Also

* [How to critique is here](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/p93po/) for artists and critics alike.  

* Don't spam the sub.  More than one submission per day is generally frowned upon.  If you've updated a piece that you submitted earlier that is great, wait till they're all done and make them an imgur album.  Imgur is RES friendly and a lot of people respond well to that.  

* Redundancy happens.  Your critics will link to the same guide a dozen times.  That's because there's always more to take and a new way to approach your art.  Listen to your critics and trust them.  They may not always know why

* Respond to your critics.  Critique is a conversation.  Nothing is sadder than a piece with two or three critiques and perhaps a lone comment by the submitter.  We expect you to have questions, yes sir, huh, whatever comes to mind.  Respond.  

* [The bi-weekly challenges are always open](http://www.reddit.com/r/MLPdrawingschool/comments/q693h/).  They are here for you to improve

* **Please give back to the community.**  If you get critiques, getting better at art and and flooding the world with pony art.  Play.

Well [I put together this here set of examples](http://imgur.com/a/WV2Su) to show how simple shadow shapes are.  Numbers correspond to rows in the picture.  

1.  This is usually where newer artists stop.  One shadow, the shadow doesn't go all the way at the edge.  This is because whatever the object is resting on will reflect light back up into the object.  This really helps to give the objects a 3d look.  Notice also how the highlights aren't touching the edge.  That's what the F is for.  **Light is either in front of or behind an object.**   To put it directly to the side is... sad and makes it look much more 2d.  

2. Secondary shadows!  Let's look at the circle for this.  Look at how the shadow is a different thickness as we go about the circle?  Inner shadows are *never* parallel to the initial shadow on living forms.  On a perfect cylinder, is it?  Shadows are closer together in areas of quick change (such as the edge) and further away in areas of gradual change.

3.  Tertiary shadows! [](/raritywhine ""This is all too much!"") These here help things look more three dimensional.  Shadows within shadows within shadows.  As we increase in depth *away from the light source* the shadows increase in darkness.  Now

4.  Darker shadows.  These are the ones that really make your objects pop.  They should follow a similar pattern of shadows within shadows but these take up very little space.  Your darkest darks and your lightest lights will always draw the most attention.  These are important, if it is a quick angle, transition quicker.  

The second image is an example of pushing things that are behind back.  The back cylinder things are behind

**Edit:**

Our heads often draw too much distinction between highlights and shadows. Here the body midtone is represented by the initial shadow. The lights/highlights are the white. A light source is implied by every line. Outline, shadows. Every. Last. Line. This is why consistency of light source is so important. Our eyes recognize it immediately, even if our conscious does not.

Or I could say that #4 is the body midtone and most everything is a highlight. Or I could say that the white is the midtone, but it is true. All the ponies start out with a body color and we call darker than that a shadow and 
lighter a highlight

**Edit 2:**

There is a lot of change in an organic form towards the edge. This is true for cylinders and spheres. [](/rarityyell ""Why is there always more!"") The closer our eyes get to the edge

Honestly, I decided to make this into a challenge of dealing with water and other shiny, reflective, and/or wet surfaces, which I am really not comfortable with at all. As an additional challenge, I decided to do almost the entire thing with a hard-edged square brush because I use a soft round brush entirely too much. I guess you could say it was a texture learning experience.

1. We start with Person A

2. Person B comes up and draws [Daisy sniffing a daisy.] (http://spicyhamsandwich.deviantart.com/art/Daisy-Sniffing-Daisies-333041388?ga_submit=10%3A1350587979) Aaaanyways

3. Person C draws a Luna waffle. Then person C requests his/her own drawing. Person C uploads the drawing and does the request in the SAME POST

and that's how this game goes! a few rules: try to keep it fairly simple (i'm definitely going to keep it more simple this time, don't request your own OC.

this is a laid-back game
