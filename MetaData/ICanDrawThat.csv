When I first started this subreddit lots of people told me that I shouldn't allow free graphic design work here.  That was a while ago

Please upvote this for visibility

Thanks

Edit:

The reason the rule was first implemented was that, free or paid.  There seems to be a lot of desire for GD work here, and I also don't want GD artists to feel like they have to do work for free.  That's why I'd like to know what the community wants.

Basically

I see two choices:

1. Keep the rule requiring art to be free

2. Get rid of the free work rule and allow GD.

I've had the same dream regularly since I was about 12 years old -19 now- where I'm driving in a car with my family and our car collides into this figure on a busy street. 

A man staggers out of the wreck and shoots us what is a some sort of scowl, from numerous time periods. I get a disgusting sense that they are the results of various attempts to tear at his own face. He dashes away from the crash, crawling and scurrying over the wreckage. 

The dream cuts to me in the garage inspecting the car. It's completely totaled. The bonnet is crushed like tin foil and all of the glass is shattered. There is no way that anything could have survived being hit like that. 

As I look on I hear this demonic chuckle. Somewhere between a witches cackle and a deep beastly roar. As I look to the source I see the figure in a painting on my wall. I am horror struck and cannot move. He begins to crawl towards me

There are variations to the dream

The dreams have been getting worse lately

Description: Short to average height with a very gaunt figure which hints and wiry strength. Poor, with coat tails, top hat and a black, steel tipped cane. Because of the cane and his gaunt figure, I at some point began to call him ""The Pin Man"".

BACKGROUND INFORMATION:
So I make short films for a hobby (as well as act) and I'm getting into preproduction on a new project right now. It's a science fiction film about these manned gun satellites that ring the Earth to protect the planet from alien objects that keep colliding with the earth whilst avoiding conventional defenses.
  
The story is about one character and the loneliness he endures as he staves off these inhuman and emotionless assaults. There's a lot more that goes into the story but I won't get into too much else.
  
ART CONCEPT  
So for the poster I wanted to show the earth in the background and the satellite (artists interpretation) in the foreground. All that I really need to be shown is some sort of firing device. I want to show how lonely it is for this guy to be working alone so far from Earth

GRATITUDE  
This poster would be used to drum up excitement for the project and would be posted across all of our social media platforms (reddit/facebook/twitter/official website) you would also be listed in the credits of the film as well as the IMDB (if you wish). I can't promise the project will blow up but I'm confident that it's going to be seen by a decent amount of people and probably wouldn't hurt if you are trying to get exposure.

TLDR- Short film about manned-weaponized satellite. Need poster (artists interpretation) depicting the Earth and the satellite at the same time. Good exposure,False,,t5_2sqsz,1355617160.0,,,t3_14wrqb

1352612350.0,12zyv8,[Request] I would like someone to help me visualize a hallucination of a demon I had during a recent episode of Sleep Paralysis,Simpsoah,18,4,18,"Hey all

I hope this is the appropriate place to post this. The demon may be fairly easy to draw for some of you

I've done a bit of research on Sleep Paralysis as I have roughly 5-6 episodes every time I try to sleep. It seems that there is a correlation between these demons and Sleep Paralysis and it would be great if someone could parse through the vague details below and help me recreate it as a reference. 

* I was sleeping on my back when this happened. I could see the demon was crouching above me at about waist level (kind of like [this](http://images2.fanpop.com/image/photos/9400000/neytiri-crouching-james-camerons-avatar-9473058-634-286.jpg)) and looking directly at me. 

* It's entire body was pitch black. I remember it being darker than anything I could imagine, and legs crossed. 

* The body of this thing was thin. There was a slight inward curve like it was malnourished. The curves here were the only non-linear features of the entire creature. The arms and legs met at a point (I remember the knees being so sharp that I thought I would cut myself if I were to touch it). 

* There were these plates that came out of it's elbows and knees (I Googled elbow blades and [this](http://fc05.deviantart.net/fs71/f/2010/327/a/2/raphael_elbow_blade_by_young9tradition-d33gxyl.jpg) is the closest example I could find). These plates were straighter and thinner (as thin as the arms) than what is shown in the link and they were about as long as it's torso.

* It's fingers were about 6x longer than a normal human finger. The tips also came to a really sharp point. I remember at one point

* The face was very pointy as well. The chin came to a sharp point, and came to three points I believe. 

* The top of the arms and the head had smoke constantly floating upwards (the smoke was the same color as the body

* I don't recall this thing having a mouth at all. If I remember that it did

I hope this is enough detail to give you a rough idea of what I saw. If you need any more information,False,,t5_2sqsz,False,,,t3_12zyv8

First off I'd like it to be a full lower sleeve done with black and grey line.
The idea behind it is from Disneys The Beauty and the Beast. More precisely that Beast wasn't able to get belles love before the last rose petal fell. And subsequently had to live with the notion that he was doomed to be the beast forever
I'd like to see what someone would draw with that pretense in mind... In my head I see it as a graphic almost batman style comic book take on the beast. (Kind of similar to zombie princess' but without the gore and solid color) Maybe perched on a castle spire but of course I'm completely open to interpretation.
I can't do this myself and the only thing stopping me is a clear idea of what I would like to present to the artist.
And of course that the artist is talented enough to do it well enough to be a lower sleeve piece that will be very visible. I live in denver.

About 4 months later, having given us more happiness than we deserved. Odie stuck around (he was an outdoor cat), and it killed my little Odie cat. It still hurts my heart a lot

* Space whales (if you do choose to draw this
* Pirates are not hunting the whales
* Whales are colorful, not mine).

Maybe there is a way to turn this into something beautiful. If someone is really passionate about this (not my expectation, I may frame it for her as a gift for her birthday or Christmas.

I figure what better way to get back to what I love doing then drawing requests from reddit! I'll be excepting the first few requests and all requests will be drawn in a tattoo style. It may take me awhile to complete your requests but just be patient and I'll try to get them up as soon as possible! If you would like your request done in color just make sure you mention it with the request but keep in mind it'll take me double the time to finish. Can't wait to start drawing up these requests!

EDIT: Wow! Got a better response then I was expecting! I've chosen a few to start with which I've begun to sketch up. They should start rolling in late tomorrow and I hope to have them all finished within 2-3 days.
