Hey Reddit

My name is Waylon Thornton
All of my music is licensed under Creative Commons as Attribution Non-Commercial Share-Alike, if it's for any project which is commercial or promotional, my permission is required, and I typically ask a licensing fee. If someone is going to make money, with my music in tow, then I deserve a cut, right?

Recently it has come to my attention that PacSun has used one of my songs in a promotional video for their new Kendall &amp; Kylie Jenner line. The only issue is, they have not replied to me, and seemingly won't.

Here's the offending video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JfKJ55CCvus (currently down until a deal is reached.)

Notice that I'm credited in the information of the video, there is no crediting information whatsoever to denote that the song is mine.

I'm not a sue happy person. I prefer to settle things through a discussion or phone call and be on my way. Even if I wanted to sue

I guess my question to you all is
Here's a link to the album from which the music was taken. I'm assuming it was picked up through the Vimeo Music Store

Sorry if this is in the wrong place
Thanks!

You're ready. The CD's been recorded. The 6 hours a day you spent perfecting every beat and rhythm to carry the pulse for the guitars. The sweat dripping down your face when you call it a day. The blood dripping from your blisters from your overworked fingers. Calloused up palms are inflamed and bright red. 

It's time now. You've spent the past four months working as many hours as you possibly could to pay the rent for the month and a half you'll be gone. For the gas to go in the van. For the van's insurance payment

You try to get some shuteye

It isn't enough. 

You wake up much earlier than you wanted to and haul yourself for one last run through over the songs before you pack everything up and head to the van at the storage center. Your blisters have partially healed

You spend the next hour breaking your kit down and making phone calls you need to make before you leave town. Mom, best friends, girlfriend, pastor, everyone. They all know the years of sacrifices you've made to get to this point. The thousands of dollars you've invested, the sleep you've lost wondering if it's worth it, being there for your bandmates in the bad times, sweat

It's time. You drive out to the van, bassist, merch guy, and you. Your best friends out of the 7.3 billion human beings on the planet. The ones that know you through and through, and know you better than you know yourself. Another two hours is spent checking inventory. Sticks, picks, strings, backup guitars, electronics, stands

It's loaded up. The trailer's full after two semi-pulled backs and an overstretched ligament. But it's nothing ibuprofen can't fix. 

You're off. The bunks are occupied. Captain and copilot have the wheel for the next seven hours. You retire to your bunk built from a 3/4'ths single mattress and wood bought from home depot

Check your bag. Realize you forgot half the stuff you needed three hours later. Spend $40 at a Love's or Sheetz to make sure you don't offend the nasal passages of everyone else in the van. 

Luckily, and games. Phone charger and macbook charger. IPOD charger. Isolation earbuds. And that nifty little curtain you installed around your bunk to keep the light out. 

You miss the town you just left. Familiar faces and good friends. You miss her. 

You drift off dreaming of your own bed

You awaken hours later(it feels like 20 minutes) as you feel the big door slide open. You poke your head out for a second to see where you are. It's the venue. Time to load in. 

After a few more sore muscles, which gives you a few more hours to doze off.

You happily retreat back to the bunk. You fall asleep for an hour and wake back up. The van isn't running

You flip the electronics on for a second to roll down all the windows. The breeze flies through the van

This moment

Your vocalist shakes you awake a couple hours later. It's time. 

You grab a fresh pair of sticks from your bag and walk inside. The crowd is big. Bigger than usual. They're chanting the band's name. The stage darkens are you all get ready. 

You settle on your throne

Click click click click goes the click track in your ear. 

Here we go. 

It's 40 minutes of non stop movement and aggressive playing. You're going crazy, and you can hear them over your vocalist. 

Two weeks later

Sleep is scarce now

You hadn't showered for days. Your hair is matted and clingy, and two day old gas station burgers are 50 cents apiece. You have no choice if you want to have money when you get home. 

By this time

People are getting fed up with each other from time to time. It's cramped, and open the sliding door to let the breeze in. 

Some nights there's a breeze to lower the temp in the van to a respectable 70 degrees. Some nights there's not. 

Everyone smells now. BO and terrible food smells permeate the air in the van. Nothing can be done. Laundry hasn't been done

Some mornings you wake up

It helps. Mom and Dad say hi and wish you well. So does sis. You're three hours behind them

Three days later

Only this wasn't a shower. You used a hose behind a KFC to wash your hair and get the grime off your body. 

You didn't manage to get all the soap out of your hair. You take the hose behind the Hardee's to finish the job. 

You can't wait to be home and be clean. To have a hot shower

The drives are long

Your body has deep aches. Your arms constantly feel like you just hit the weights for an hour straight. The blisters are extremely painful. The callouses are constantly red and tender. 

Kids have been telling you what a sick drummer you are

Fast forward to the last night of tour. You didn't sleep at all the previous night

Your phone has been off for a week. The company screwed up the autopay system, and you've never been happier. 

It's the hometown show for you. Mom, pastor, friends, family, and she is there. She smiles at you as you sit on your throne, ready to go. 

The intro kicks in

It's done. The kids are cheering

Mom and Dad hug you and tell you they're proud of you. You weep openly at their acceptance and cognizance of the work you've put in. 

Friends hug you and pat you on the back and welcome you home. You politely decline requests to go out to eat. 

You secretly hope you never eat anything unhealthy again. 

You reek of BO and sweat. 

The van takes off and take the trailer back to the storage unit

You pile into your car and throw your bag on the passenger seat. You take in the solitude and sink your head into the seat for a moment

You made it. 

The drive home seems so short compared to what you just went through. 

You've got the apartment to yourself. Everyone else is with family or girlfriends. 

You'll see her tomorrow. She's got school and went home after you reconciled at the show. 

Shower time. You strip down and throw your incredibly dirty

You sit in the shower til the water turns ice cold

You notice the six pounds the tour diet added to you in the mirror. 

You throw on the clean pair of clothes Mom and Dad gave you

You're out in a matter of moments. 

Two things cross your mind before you close your eyes.

You have to be at work at noon tomorrow. 

And you can't wait to be back on the road again. 


It's that set time. It's what you live for. What you dream about.

* **Internal temps:** Processor core temp is around 32c idle, and over the top and bottom of the interface card. From there, the blower vacuums the warm air out of the side of the case. Under full load, the warm air blowing out is lukewarm, at best. I performed a 24-hour cooling test (with temp probes from my multi-meter) and the results were similar.
 
* **Interface wiring:** The Delta 1010lt comes with 8/8 analog I/O; all I did was convert the ends to an unbalanced XLR plug. In total, if someone is interested. Just send me a PM.

* **Cost:** All in all, screen, wiring, various hardware, paint, solder, came to about $1500. It took me about 100 hours to build

Basically


""Beautiful things grow out of shit""- Brian Eno

(http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=We1Cvs44i-Q&amp;t=35s)

But

* Start with the Instruments First

This means simple orchestration-if you have a bunch of tracks all in in the same octave

* Patches First

Even if you don't do synth based music, it's always better to tweak the filters in your synth before you turn to EQ to get rid of brightness or unwanted body. It's always better to change the recording or the sound itself then to try to fix it downstream.

* Stack

A lot of times you need more then one layer to a sound. If you say, the body where your hands resonate a small bit, and then the reverb tail from whatever room you are in. This isn't just true talking about synths, it's the foundation of pop music to stack vocals, you hear multiple rythym guitars in all kinds of stuff. Even coming from the same audio, using returns to have multiple FX chains on one voice is a vital part of your sonic repertoire.

* Levels

If you don't have a preliminary master done before you start mixing, it's going to be impossible to mix.

Another part of this is compression. You don't want so much dynamic range that you can't hear the low amplitude stuff, or the release too short that its abruptly changing or so long it's constant. Generally I also tweak the compressors after I'm onto mastering to get them just right.

Distortion falls into the range of compression, same thing with valve amps.

* Pan It!

Dial in the stereo field before you start with the EQ. It opens up everything so much. Bass should be panned center or very close in most cases

* Delays

Delays are very easy to get right

* Highpasses Are Your Friends

This is definitely important enough to give a whole section to.The bass is where mud can become very very apparent


* General EQ Tips

Cut before you boost, you want high Q, low gain filters, but again, trust your ears. The only way to really get a feel for the spectrum is to just fuck around with EQ for a while, but here's some rough general ranges if you're really clueless.

20-60-shirt shaking subbass. Most systems can't even reproduce this accurately. Only one voice can really fit in here

60-120-low end of the bass. Again

120-300-the body of sounds lie here and a little above. It's crucial not to have interference here

300-900-Mud. Surgically cut out portions of this on most sounds-others like pads or things in the background might need more aggresive EQ though. Again

900-1200-Presence. Voices tend to compete here

1.2-3.5K-Bightness. As you get higher up

3.5-5K-Airiness. But brightness as well-like all of these ranges it's a continuum. Esses normally lie here but don't just cut off those

5-8K-A lot of noisy stuff occupies this range. A lot of the character of a sound lies up here. Along with the hissy range above 8K. Hiss is good if it's imperceptible

* Your Glue

So you have your EQing done but it's just not grooving yet, the less high end you need. Longer predelays as well, along with less early reflection. And of course, the dry/wet needs to be dialed in correctly. Don't give much or any stereo field to things that need to be in the center.


* Use Them Ears

When in doubt, wait 15 mins till it's out of your head. Sleep on it even. Then listen to your material again. It'll give you a little new perspective. Also, watch your levels, it's easy for them too creep right up on you.

Also

* PROTECT THEM EARS!

You only get one set, and to always watch the levels of your audio:it's even more irresponsible to damage your audience's ears.

I see lots of threads on here asking for help to make your home recordings and mixes sound better. Here are some things that I've learned over the years that may be helpful to others.

Note for the pedantic among you: none of these tips are hard and fast rules. There are situations where almost all of them wont apply. Take what works for you and adapt it

1. When recording an input try to get the input volume to be as loud as possible without clipping. Clipping is the enemy. You'd rather have an overall quieter signal amplified in post processing than a loud signal with clipping all over it. Quiet can be fixed

2. Record dry

3. Mix via EQ. Relative track volumes are important, and hats, but not have lots of useless spectrum ties up where the vocals and guitars sit. If you get every track shaped right with EQ mixing will be a lot easier, and sound a lot better.

4. Learn compression. It can be hard to grasp, it'll make your drums punch, and it'll even out your vocals so they sound consistent and professional. Spend time learning this. It will set you apart.

5. Double and triple track vocals. This doesn't apply 100% of the time. For example

6. Unless you want to go for a specifically cold, or some sound, and drone it low in the mix (barely audible) through the whole track. Just leave it there and ignore it. It will take up the space hiss and recording noise would have taken up back in the day. It will make things sounds ""more real.""

7. A little bit of reverb on (almost) everything. Take a decent reverb

8. You probably want delay on your vocals, compression, and a nice stereo delay.

9. Practice good digital recording hygiene. Name your tracks something descriptive. Name your projects something description. Color code tracks and group them. Keep your project folders organized. Backup, backup. This stuff pays off and makes you more productive and keeps you from losing work. Take your work seriously in this regard.

10. Technique is more important than equipment. I get better mixes out of a 100$ audio interface, tracks are clipping on input, and your mix is mushy. Put in the time, experiment, and get good at the craft. Then throw equipment at it :)

11. Leave headroom in your mix. Let your mastering engineer squash it if that's what you want.

Hope this stuff helps some folks.

EDIT: Bonus point I thought of:
Plan your stereo image. Don't pile everything up dead center, vocals dead center, hats slight left, and strings mid right, etc. Just like with EQ use the stereo image to give things space.",,False,t5_2qmah,True

](http://pitchfork.com/features/guest-lists/8735-guest-list-best-of-2011/5/)

**Top Ways To Not Completely Eat Shit on Tour**

1. Do NOT hire a tour manager. This one comes with a big caveat. Only do this if you have your shit together, and are not intimidated by having some semblance of responsibility for your own career, you can totally do this yourself. It's really not rocket science. If you are the kind of person that likes being on time, and can book a flight to somewhere in the continental US on your own, you will be very good at self tour managing. While it is work, so is touring. This right here will save you 10-20% in commission, as well as the expense of an extra person. I have done this for many tours, you will avoid herding cats.

2. Hire a tour manager, or c. generally don't like being responsible for yourself. While I say this last part with some modicum of sarcasm, really, you'd be surprised. Some people just aren't built like that. I have met a lot of musicians who would rather have a bad guy to take the blame than to be responsible for their own fuck-ups.

3. Buy a vehicle to tour in. This may seem elementary, you have a head start on that fruit basket delivery service you've had your eye on.

4. Make merch people actually want. Posters are great, and restock as needed. T-shirts are second best in terms of something people always want. It's tempting to go for some cutesy mercy thing that nobody else has, but a lot of them are duds. So unless you're determined to roll out smorgasbord style, stick to the stuff that actually works. One item does not fit all. I know some artists who still can kill on CDs. I can't. C'est La Vie.

5. If at all possible, the kind of folks with interesting shit to talk about other than music. I guar-an-fucking-tee that you are not going to want to debate which Zep' album is definitively their best by day 13 or day 26. East coast scrabble champ 2007-2009? Sign me up. Opinionated annoying music encyclopedia? 'Scuse me while I fucking choke myself to death. While this won't always affect your bottom line, successful touring is best thought of as buying a timeshare; it pays off incrementally over many years. One three-week stint with a complete dickface can sour you to the whole idea.

6. Get yourself a good booking agent. This is frankly easier said than done, and yield you considerable sums. I often talk to artists who can't find an agency to take them on, thus, I know this can be hard to source. Nevertheless, get in where you fit in. For what they do the commission is without a doubt worth it.

7. Pretend you joined the army. This may sound like a joke, and b. eat well. You know how they say that in the military, they tell you not to touch your face for sanitary reasons? It's true. If you love picking bogs, you better stop now, cause you are entering ground fucking zero for germs and shit. For food stock up on rations. Peanut butter, dried fruits and nuts, soymilk and cereal-- all your friends

8. Know what a properly functioning show looks like. Don't know? Watch. I have been telling myself this for years, and if I didn't step in and make things happen (backline, soundcheck, set times, etc), no one would have picked up the pieces on my behalf. Most nights, it's clear what roles people play. Other times, again

9. Sell your own merch. I guarantee this will double or triple your sales. It just does.

10. Don't be an asswipe. I've gotten gigs from promoters, etc, just from them saying ""Oh, we had him last year and he wasn't difficult at all, not like artist X was, jesus that guy sucked"". You can be supremely talented and popular and people will put up with your shit to book you. You will also be the 3%, sooner or later they become one of the rest of us 97%ers. And when that happens, just pretend that you're the same guy that was stacking boxes 5 years ago for $9/hr,,False

Since day 1 I have run Radio Rebel without paying myself a dime. And as of now, Radio Rebel does not even make enough to sustain itself. I pay for everything out of pocket. 

I have been actively honing my development skills, I will need to completely rethink my ideas.  This is why I need help! I am searching for a talented developer who is willing to dedicate themselves to the cause of changing the music industry, and who is willing to take a risk with me. 


I have *dedicated my life* to this project. I *will not stop* until I am successful. 

If there is anyone out there that can help me

___________________________________

**Edit:** I would like to shed some insight on part of the plan to make this idea a reality.  

**Stage 1:** Get musicians interested in Radio Rebel's independent radio station. - CHECK

**Stage 2:** Build a prototype of the ""free to sell digital distribution platform"". 

**Stage 3:** Launch a kickstarter and/or indiegogo campaign. Contact numerous media outlets to get exposure for the campaign. Also

**Stage 4:** Use funding from crowd sourcing to complete the platform

**Stage 5:** Launch! Cross fingers.

I see there are lots of talented people here on reddit from all sorts of disciplines but collaboration is always a daunting prospect

As an instrumentalist/vocalist etc you record yourself and upload your riff or stem with a little info about it and/or a suggestion as to its use. And as a producer you can download this material and use it for free in your tracks and upload your finished/wip material that perhaps someone else can take even further.

Of course there is plenty of room for everything in-between such as uploading stems from your tracks or partly finished projects like i mentioned earlier but the emphasis would have to be on original material and not just interesting riffs that you like/found that you would like to hear in a tune.

I feel that this is something radio reddit could very much get behind too and would provide a nice stream of original content!
Anyway

**Edit:** You don't have to be kind necessarily. Just make the responses appropriate.

**EDIT 2:** I'm really happy we are actually discussing this! Now if anyone reads this I don't know but there are quite a few people I'd like to address collectively on an issue that seems to be popular in this debate. So the song is, punk music. Now I know from experience playing with him that he is a talented musician and could easily play a plethora of other things, but he always comes back to punk, because he enjoys it! Now the post we have been arguing about was a comment in a ""shitty pop"" post, and I guess it really got to me because I could see one of my best friends posting something very similar. Not for the fame and fortune, but just to build feedback and get his stuff out there, which is what we all essentially want, ""*Hey,False,

1289779565.0,e640p,Key points I've learned after making electronic music for 10 years.,ElGreatScott,293,23,102,"I want to post this here in hopes that some of the aspiring folks will find some technical nuggets of wisdom. 

Some quick background first: I REALLY started from scratch. I started messing around with composition on computers a bit over 10 years ago, no YouTube tutorials, not really any tutorials in general.  Making music on computers was *just* on the verge of becoming a workable route to take. 

It's been a long journey. About two years ago I started getting my first legit deals with labels that have proper distribution (beatport/addictech/etc) and marketing.

Here are some simple things I've learned:

1. ""It's not what you have, and nothing more than a cheap MIDI controller, a pair of decent headphones, and a decent soundcard.

2. The best way to learn is to f$ck around. Pure and simple. Tutorials are great for expanding your knowledge, but you'll have the added benefit of discovering new ways to do accomplish things/make new sounds along the way that other people haven't thought of! Don't rely solely on tutorials.

3. Don't expect to make banging tunes in any short-term time frame (a few years) unless you have some good outside help. I didn't. It took me 8 years. I know a few folks who get it down solid in &lt; 2 years

4. There are 3 important skills to develop: a) Writing/making music b) Proper mixing c) Mastering. A lot of people tend to focus on (a), then you can provide the unmastered version for their people to take care of.

5. The process of mixing and mastering is really different in electronic vs acoustic music. Don't get lost in the wrong area when trying to pick up on this stuff.

6. Think in the frequency domain. Making a song ""sound good"" (melody/sequencing aside), if there's too much frequency separation, things can sound bland. Something to be aware of when creating parts/layers.

7. I'm really glad I learned piano

8. Don't pull all of your inspiration from other electronic music. That's a quick way to make really generic tracks.

9. Constantly ask trusted sources for feedback. Ideally from other producers who have a good ear / are putting good things out (the pros). Don't always expect good news. When I say ""trusted"" I mean people who aren't afraid to criticize your work and tell you what they truly think about it / what they would do to your song if they were in your shoes.

10. Never get full of yourself or your work.

11. Make music because you enjoy it... not to make money or get famous... this will subsequently increase your chances of making money and getting famous.

12. Constantly analyze the music of artists you admire. Take it apart. Try to pick out all the layers and fx.

EDIT: A clarification for #4. Labels are generally expected to take care of mastering for you. Not always mixing. It's good to get a rough handle on both

1. Play music and go to concerts with other music lovers.

2. Visit various baseball stadiums across the country.

3. Eat the best BBQ the heartland has to offer.

4. Figure out what the fuck to do with the rest of my life.

In some of the cities, I have no idea where I'm going to stay. If you live in or around any of the cities I'm visiting, and are not an axe murderer, I would love to meet up and jam, or go to a show, or just have a beer and talk about music.

Since hearing the news of his death, anything to supplement my fading memory of our time spent together. I scoured school yearbooks and old computers for photos but my search came up empty. I remembered our recording session well but I feared the music was lost forever. Last night I was finally able to find the original files on a noisy old hard drive roughly the size of a shoebox. 

Hearing Alex play the guitar after all these years was a deeply emotional experience for me. I was overcome by grief recalling the memory of his presence. He was a good humored and loyal friend and our shared experiences came back to me all at once. I saw him standing in my garage with his trademark white t-shirt and blue jeans shredding on an electric guitar. I remember sitting on concrete in the corner of our high school quad eating lunch together in the shade day after day. I remember knowing him almost exclusively by his last name because Teves seemed to fit better than Alex did at the time. I remember driving aimlessly around his neighborhood in our friend's van so we could appropriately rock out to Cream's ""White Room"" until the final note. I remember a series of events that escalated quickly from watching Fight Club for the first time to starting a short-lived and dreadfully misguided boxing club in his back yard. I remember when he introduced me to an obscure little blues-rock band called The Black Keys. I remember video games

Though we were close for only a few teenage years, my old friend is alive again. 

Rest in peace Alex Teves.

Therefore you have time to listen to other people's music and comment on it too.  

I have seen forums and music communities come and go due to the dominance of selfishness/self-promo and a lacking sense of community. A community based on selfishness will fall apart.  

**You guys really want this subreddit to be all it can be?  
I then declare this as an unofficial rule of [Listen] posts.**  

Keept at LEAST a 2:1 ratio. Feedback will KEEP THE MUSIC FLOWING.  You'd be surprised what some positive comments and constructive criticism can do for people who share the same desire to make good music as you do.  

Leave your selfishness at the door if you want people (especially your fellow music-makers) to listen to your music!
  
EDIT: Not even necessarily before posting. Returning feedback to people just to those who give it to you works even better in my past experience.

EDIT: So apparently I am being overly crass about this. Declaring an unofficial rule != Demanding. I'm not policing it nor do I plan on it being enforced. Some of you guys are pretty sensitive and I'm TRULY sorry if you were offended by me saying that. I'm just being realistic though. This is just a tough love post. If you guys REALLY think I am intent on creating a FORCED SYSTEM

I have helped a lot of people improve their beat-making skills through giving constructive feedback and some tough love here and there. You can be selfish if you want as this is not r/pyongyang. If you're mad at me for being blunt

The community I was a part of before, it didn't happen all the time and wasn't perfect and that was fine too because people understand that we don't have all the time in the world.

I see this come up in almost every thread. It seems that so many people think music theory is some instruction set or algorithm that will dictate their playing and style and not allow them to try new things.

**Here is my definition:**

As I see it, make sentences, and form complex thoughts that others can read later an understand. Yes, you can learn this yourself by tinkering with things on your own, but it may never be as concrete (example: Am and C have the exact same notes in their scales. So you could solo over a tune/progression that is in Am with the C major scale). This is the same thing as with chemistry. Yes, you can learn all about atoms, compounds

It is corporate greed at its finest

I will most definitely contact Feinstein

-------------------------


Hi there

This is Tim

I am writing to ask for your urgent help. An important piece of legislation has just been introduced in Congress that could end long-standing discrimination against Internet radio. **I'm asking that you contact your Senator to urge them to support the Internet Radio Fairness Act.**

This bipartisan bill will correct the incredible inequity in how different digital radio formats are treated under the law when it comes to setting royalties. The difference is quite extraordinary. In 2011

As a lifelong musician, and is playing the songs of tens of thousands of promising artists who would otherwise never be heard. It should be given a fair chance to succeed. 

To voice your support for this initiative

Senator: Dianne Feinstein

Washington D.C. Office Number: 202-224-3841

You can also tweet your representative: @SenFeistein


If you'd like more information about the Internet Radio Fairness Act you can learn more here. 

It's crucial that Congress hears from fans of Internet radio today. Thanks for your support
 
Tim Westergren

Founder


 
**EDIT:** The main thing I'm learning here is that most of you don't know the real numbers involved at all. I've put a detailed response to one poster here

The most common thing being said here is that Pandora pays, hardly a ""vast majority"". In the last fiscal quarter, that meant Pandora had *over 40 million dollars after paying royalties, to run their company*. That's for a 3 month period, or about 13.3 million dollars *per month*. 

Pandora is working to expand. That costs money. Rather than make a profit

**EDIT2**: Here is some info on the exec pay

*CEO Joseph Kennedy:  $732

*CFO Steven Cakebread - $446

*CTO Thomas Conra - $3.4 million

*CMO Simon Fleming-Wood - $2.7 million

*CRO John Trimble - $4.6 million

To contextualize
I had been labeling myself as a dubstep/ EDM genre producer for about a year and been solely pumping out bass music... until very recently.
Ive started just sitting down and making tracks, supersaws) and it feels so much better to just make the music that comes naturally to me.  thats not to say dont make genres that you like, but when youre not feeling inspired to make that raw electro track youve been dreaming of, just sit down and play.  It feels so rewarding to create a piece that is not limited by genre specific conventions.

to the more experienced producers on reddit what do you guys think?

TL;DR: stop forcing genre boundaries in your music and just make music

One thing I've learned and learned well: there is no such thing as authenticity in music. You wanna be heard? You gotta pay. The bands that seem so ""authentic"" and hard-scrabble actually have thousands of dollars behind them

That's just how the game is played. This is a business like any other

Over the years, because I've accepted the reality of the situation. So here are my past experiences and what I've found. Please share any info you care to share :)

Grooveshark: mostly a ghost-town now, and some of them actually bought my music. But it's a dead site now, for the most part.

ReverbNation: I spent less than $100

Noisetrade: have you seen their newsletters and website? Wow, you pay $1000 for a front-page and newsletter feature. Has anyone tried this? I'm on Noisetrade as an artist and have gotten like 50 downloads without paying for promo, and you'll get the downloaders' email addresses, but that seems like an awful lot of cash just for the pleasure of giving your music away for free.

AAM College radio promo: I live in NYC, you'll need to spend like several thousand dollars with them, and I'm not sure college radio is very high-yield for promo.  Anyone else?

Spotify: THE big daddy, which runs promo for a month. MINIMUM! So next time you see a hard-scrabble, bearded, poverty-stricken, authentic musician being promoted on Spotify, realize it's costing well over $10,000. There's your fucking indie DIY for you.

1. Songs too long. Unless you're going to change something

2. Songs too repetitive. 16 bars of that verse riff is too much. The song needs to grow and change. See #1.

3. Playing guitar solos out of key. Doesn't matter how fast you shred if you're playing noise.

4. Bad appearance. If you're going on stage

5. Not changing it up. Predictable is boring. Put a stop, there's a problem.

6. Not harmonizing. Harmonies take vocals from good to great.

7. Standing still. Move around

8. Not interacting with the audience. They paid to see your show

9. Not interacting with your band mates. Have fun with the other people on stage.

10. Being too drunk on stage. What sounds awesome to you will sound sloppy to the audience.

11. Fiddling around making noise on your instruments between songs. Makes you sound like a high school garage band.

12. Begging people to come to the stage. Don't sound desparate. If they're feeling it

13. Not bringing extra guitars. Broke a string? Sorry

14. Turning amps up too loud. Great

15. Being out of tune. And we shouldn't hear you tuning either. Use a pedal tuner which mutes the guitar.

16. Too much downtime between songs. Keep the show moving.

17. Begging people to bring you shots/beer. If you suddenly run out of drink that's one thing

18. Singing out of key. I feel like I shouldn't even have to write this

19. Playing a bunch of slow, don't get all slow and depressing on them. They want to have a good time.

20. Not taking it seriously. Play every show like it's a big show

Edit: I see a lot of comments here about how music is art and you should be able to do whatever you want. That's true. But I'm talking about how to be an engaging live performer and put on a great show. This comes from years of experience, you have to think about live performance.

* **Obstructive Ads** - Sure, websites need to cover costs, but the ads on tablature sites have reached porn-level proportions. Banner ads would be fine, but no, there are pop-ups, screen-dimmers... it's a ridiculous amount of bloat when what you're attempting to access boils down to a .txt file.

* **No Consistency -** From tab to tab, some space everything out evenly with time-counts underneath, others write a blurb saying listen to the song for timing. And yes, there are generally accepted symbols for things like slides and hammer-ons, but someone always has to be different.

* **Bogus / Incomplete Info -** This one gives you the right chords, but the tab lines are all skewed, so you'll never know. This one has the chords for the entire song written out in one line, or are those notes? You've got to love the guy who posts a tablature which consists of five notes of the melody.

* **Redundancy -** Many songs have 5 or 10 versions posted

**But

* **Clean, light design.

* **Community-Enforced Style -** Style guides to ensure tabs are all in one format.

* **""One song, obviously if the artist has an alternative version, like an acoustic version, it would warrant it's own tab) but you get the idea. Let's cut out all those duplicates. In wiki format, things are collaborative and errors can be corrected, so we'd have one version, and it would be the most complete and most accurate.

* **Only see what you want -** Collapsible sections (for instance, time counts, etc.

So for the last few months I've been working on a mobile app idea for songwriters who want to find out if their music is any good. I regularly use /r/songwriters/ and other music forums

Below is the idea I came up with. This is the kind of app I can imagine using myself

* You open-up the app and - via the SoundCloud API - see your library of SoundCloud tracks - pick a track you want to share and hit 'publish'
* That track gets pushed out to five random users of the app
* They listen to the track and rate it either ""OK""
* If it's ""OK"" the track pushes out to 1 more random user
* The process repeats and the track continues spreading virally throughout the app userbase
* There's an animated UI that uses the metaphor of a garden. So you get to see your tracks as seeds
* Then there'll be a blog that publishes the top ten tracks each week.

**EDIT:** a few quick points I didn't originally mention that people are asking about - 

* Yes there will be an optional genre filter of some kind
* You have to rate a certain number of tracks for each track you upload
* You can have the option of breaking-down ratings into different aspects of the track to get more detailed feedback (such as production, etc - thanks to evan274!) 

I think the key appeal is that critiquing becomes 'fun' and you don't need to spend ages building up a following on SoundCloud or YouTube in order for people to listen to your stuff. Everyone starts off equally

So anywho... What do you guys think? Is this something you personally would want to use (i'm also open to collaboration if anyone wants to help out)?",,t5_2qmah,1372977043.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WeAreTheMusicMakers/comments/1hms55/app_that_makes_music_critique_funlooking_for_some/

* Pouch: The G has half matt finish. The F will be bright and shiny.

Ok

I made a music video for a major label record company.  The contract for this project was a work made for hire (meaning that I promised to assign my copyright ownership to them for the compensation I received).   But the record company has not paid me a substantial portion of the contracted total.   

Any copyright lawyers out there who can answer this, but I am just looking to see if such a precedent already exists.

In general

What makes this most frustrating is that the Artist

Anyway sorry for bringing a downer to subreddit that usually brings me such joy.   Keep up making the beautiful music

EDIT - I totally agree with all of you who are advising to get a lawyer and to see - but holding off a bit cause the 2 recommended to me sound like they will want a retainer that is 50% of what I am owed.   And my goal isn't to sue.  

My Goal is to make a legitimate enough sounding threat of pursuing an infringement case that they will just pay.  There is no argument that they owe the money or that the project is delivered as they wanted.  They just are not paying cause they have what they need

Hoping that there is a really cool lawyer out there on Reddit, or at least sometimes does.  (In my mind this Lawyer is a really cool cat who plays Jazz on the weekends, still reads the newspaper cause he likes the feel of the rough print between his fingers, happens to know copyright law like the back of his hand, and likes to stand up for the little guy.  Not sure why those details are important : ).

But even if not lawyer

TL: DR;  Record label ain't paying

EDIT: Thanks all for the Advise!  After talking to a Lawyer,  and to small to make it worth someone else getting involved. 

This company is a huge conglomerate, seems will only hurt my other work there.  I did ""accidentally let it slip"" to one of the heads of another department that usually has my back about the situation I was in.   So hoping that they are able to put some internal pressure on it.  Anyway,  Thanks for the support, kind words and Advice!  No go create some amazing music and call me to make a video for you!

Soundcheck all went great

The band are stoked

But... the stupid fucking club owner thought she could smell burning

Sooo, everything was coming from the monitors on stage and my subs. Nightmare. It sounded worse than dreadful. 

I ran over the the bar and I'm like WTF

This stupid cows response ( she was Italian ) ""I turn the speakers off as I smell burning"" So I'm like: Well turn them back on again

Her: I can't do that

Me: What the fuck do you mean you can't do that

Her: Well they can just play

Of course the band can't hear this as they're behind the rig so they just keep playing and by this point I've got the management people hassling me over the obvious i.e. it sounds fucking shit. 

Anyway I've lost it with this stupid bitch and I'm threatening to jump over the bar and flip the damn breakers myself just to get some power. 

She's like: I can smell the burning

Me: Well if you can still smell the burning then it's obviously not the damn speakers, A BAND THAT HAVE BOOKED OUT THE WHOLE VENUE FOR THIS ONE EVENT!!??

Her: I don't care about band

Me: Fuckin

I swear to gawd some people are just born stupid. 

The management have cottoned on to what's happening at this point and they're now screaming at her too. So eventually after four songs

I mean just...

We pulled it off by the skin of our teeth for the last three songs

Anyway, or my advice isn't relevant to you, that's fine.  It doesn't apply to everyone, only myself and hopefully a few others.

* **Your technical skill is of the utmost importance.**  I used to think technical skill was for the virtuosos, you don't know enough about your instrument.  There were people mastering the guitar, or the drum machine, or the sampler, or the synth, or the piano, or the voice *long before you*.  What I'm saying here is that you're complaining level 3 is too difficult when other people struggled with level 20.

* **Learn to communicate.** When I was 18 or 19, but I was in charge, and I'd written the songs.  ""Play an Eb chord here"", I said.  ""Uh, I don't know what that is,"" he replied.  ""I have my own style, and I just play whatever.""  He's a nice guy, and you'll find yourself with less problems in the practice room.  Music theory isn't the final word

* **Your lyrics matter more than you think.**  If you're involved in every aspect of a song's production

* **Feel matters more than specifics.**  This ties in with ""less is more"".  You can make the most overdone chord progressions sound meaningful.  Take The White Stripes as an example.  They weren't doing anything particularly special, that's totally fine.  But remember that some things work for a reason, and that what differentiates these songs is the *feel*.  That's what people grab onto, what keeps them thinking or dancing or feeling or singing or clapping along.  A great actor can still move you with crappy dialogue.  The greatest things happen when a great actor has great dialogue.


* **Don't underestimate the 'sound'.**  This is more important than ever in our digital age.  How instruments 'sound' is *so* important.  If you're using stock VSTs and presets

* **Find the spaces.**  There is only enough room for, one instrument can shine through.  If one track is playing a melodic part, everything else should be holding back in response.  If that isn't enough, your one melodic track isn't compelling.  Fight the compulsion to force other voices to compensate.

* **Less is more.**  You hear people saying this all the time, more tracks, more voices.  I'd need vocal harmonies, a bass line that moved around a lot, weird chord changes and so on.  Then I'd hear something like Smog's [The Well](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8VLdOGtG1g) and wonder how the hell he managed to make such a repetitive song so utterly compelling.  Think of it this way:  if you can make the simplest of songs sound brilliant using only your voice and your instrument of choice, everything else will follow.  **If something doesn't sound intriguing by itself, it's easy to cover it up with more tracks**.  Think about it.  Are you trying to improve the song, are you *trying to prove how clever you are by throwing more parts on the song*?


That may have been a rambling diatribe.  If it was

1370031716.0,1ffbd2,"How to acoustically treat your studio or workspace: Monitors, Modes, and Materials (x-post from r/audioengineering)",chillsun,191,11

I keep seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head on this subreddit and /r/audioengineering . I am making this post in hopes that I and others in the community that have knowledge and experience in this important aspect of recording can impart some of it to those that don't have as much knowledge or experience. I am also hoping this can get added to the sidebar so we can stop seeing this topic/question rear it's ugly head. Note

So you want to make recordings? Maybe you already have made one. Maybe you have made a couple and some of them sound great, you should begin to think about how you monitor your sound. That is, how sound gets from your monitors/speakers to your ears. First, you will need a ""trustworthy"" set of monitors if you don't have any. I put trustworthy in quotes because it doesn't ""matter"" what you buy. I put matter in quotes because it only matters what you buy as your ears become attuned to certain subtle sonic characteristics in music. Buy monitors with the best qualities you like that you can afford. Personally, I use Yamaha HS80Ms and have for years. I picked the HS80s some 5 years ago for a few reasons. The first was that they look like NS10s (rad!). The second, to my lesser-trained ears 5 years ago, those monitors sounded pristine compared to other options. Did I mention I got a crazy discount on them at the time? Oh, though

You have monitors. You are most likely in an apartment, or some combination of those three things. Maybe you are in a project studio in the G ""room"" that hardly passes for a drum booth. If you are the last option, I hate to say it, but you need a larger space. You can try to make small spaces work, but you really need at least a 10x10 room to dedicated completely to this. Room dimensions you say? Now is a good time to check out these ratios of ""ideal"" room ratios. Also, grab a tape measure and measure your room. Write it down, dummy.

**Height**:**Width**:**Length**

**1.00**:**1.14**:**1.39**

**1.00**:**1.28**:**1.54**

**1.00**:**1.60**:**2.33**



courtesy of Ethan Winer http://www.ethanwiner.com/acoustics.html

If you have a room that falls into this ratio, but it comes closest to the second. The dimensions of my apartment bedroom studio are 8'x10'x13'. Why does this matter? Modes!

Room modes, as long as the listener places their ears anywhere in front of the monitors they will hear essentially every frequency at equal volumes. Your mileage may vary. In apartment bedroom studios it is close to impossible to get rid of all of your room modes. Why? Something something parallel walls, square dimensions, sheet rock. What we can do is tailor a specific area that sounds accurate and depending on how well you do this your area can grow quite large! So how exactly does a room mode get created? As you know, all things resonate at a fundamental frequency, even you. Rooms are no different and the size of your room is actually part of a wave form. If you have your audio unit converter handy, convert 16' into hertz. You should get close to 70hz. That means 70hz takes 16' to go from 0 to +1 to 0 to -1 and back to 0. That is

Waveforms have the most energy when they are changing polarity. That is, speakers are striking the walls through convection of air.

You can calculate your room modes here. http://www.bobgolds.com/Mode/RoomModes.htm

If you calculated your room modes you will notice that all of the frequencies fall in a pattern. Halves and doubles, 280, 560, and possibly even 1120. (You know I did, playboy.) Mind you, this is just for the height of my room! You might be thinking of quitting now, but don't

You know what your room modes are, some reflections can be good. 

Reflections, because the word itself says nothing of the direction of the reflected wave which is important if we're trying to direct excess frequencies away from our ears. There is a specific class of reflectors called diffusers that cause reflections to splay out in lots of random directions instead of one consistently unknown location. As far diffusers go, the beauty is in the curved surface that reflects in infinitely random directions. I have some reflectors in place to balance the color of my room. All rooms will need a balance of all materials. Some things in your room can be used as reflectors. Flat walls are reflectors. I use a combination of strategically placed absorbers and the existing walls to achieve my most accurate results.

Ok, and/or diffusers? With mirrors. I used a handheld mirror with a hole in the handle just small enough for a push pin to pin the mirror to the wall. I pinned the mirror to the wall, sat in my chair, and looked to see if I could see any portion of my speaker in it. If I could see the woofer I made a mark of it on the wall. If I could see the tweeter, I made that mark, too. I went all the way around the room except for behind the monitors where I knew I would be placing a broadband absorber. I have also made a large effort to pull the monitors off of the wall. Walls have a nasty proximity effect, if your ears or your monitors sit too close to them you will notice. In the end I ended up putting one absorber behind each monitor hanging vertically

I decided to setup up my room with the longest wall in front of me, it would not work if I wanted to work in the room. Ok, modes, my ""front to back"" mode is 55hz. Yikes! The complimentary frequency spread includes lots of low frequencies. I went super hard on broadband absorbers and stuffed my acoustic panels with rock wool. Rock wool and acoustic fiberglass will absorb frequencies as low as 125hz. Fun fact, HS80Ms aren't behemoths when it comes to producing 85hz and under so I don't have to worry ""much"" about that. I have easily 4"" of rock wool in my front and back panels and it cleans up that room mode nicely. For those pesky short walls I ended up putting a bookshelf stocked with heavy books, vinyl, and cables on the window side and free standing broadband absorbers on the closet side. I also hung curtains (on the rare occasion I want a brighter sound in the room I draw the curtains to reveal shiny plastic sliding closet doors). The main idea here is I wanted to put as much mass as I could between the speakers where they reflect off the wall and the walls. I don't have any figures to back this up, low frequencies pools where planes meet). One corner is occupied by a gigantic square armchair (another bass trap

I want to double back to that thing I said about your ears distance from the floor. This fact is why studios with hardwood floors sound so nice. For my studio I went out and bought one of those hard plastic office mat rollers. It makes a world of difference.

**Don't let stacked hanging panels touch. The one on the bottom will fall.***

Fogel contacted my friends band to book a show with them, Fogel harassed the lead singer about the turnout.  She declined to engage as the show had already begun, but later in the set she explained to the crowd what happened while thanking us for being supportive.  The band left immediately with no discussion, and no money.

Apparently the ""deal"" was my friends band bring 35 people, and they promoted as normal but ended up with a light crowd. I am close to these people, and know the other fans, I do not know the exact count, but it was at least 18, and I personally left with 10 friends.  I knew every single person in attendance by name, with means that he brought: 0 people. 

More importantly, complaining that only 8 people came when he specified that 35 people must come.


What does a promoter do if they don't bring people to a show?  We all have off nights, especially since the venue will easily book you directly and not take more of your money.

Keep in my mind my musical tastes are all over the place.  Honestly.  I grew up on piano with classical music, then jazz/classical guitar/world music at around 18-19 years old and then dance music, EDM, and all variances of electronic music from 21 and up.  I'm also leaving out hip hop, celtic music of various sorts, and a bunch of other sub types of music.

Classical music is the history of music for the past few hundred years, or Mozart or even Wagner if that's your thing, to remind you where this is all coming from.  For example, i'm listening to Debussy on piano, and the compositions are blowing my mind each time I hear them, the textures, the fluidity of motion between all the different voices and lines of melody......all done on one instrument, who had naught but pen

So let's take a step back from out computers, renaissance, or other traditional/worldly music to invigorate our aural synapses.

some thoughts about putting together a band.  Here's my shot. 
Quinn  
 
		On Leading
				By Quinn Martin
					6-6-11
 
All the following should be followed to the letter
feel right.  In that case
 
						I.
	HAVE A VISION. BE POLITE.  BE PERSISTENT.
 
 
		For an Audience there are two kinds of music.  Music
they know and music they don't.   Decide what you are gonna play to
them. 
		Your style is based on limitations (artificial
technical
		What you don't play defines who you are. 
		Musicians listen with their ears.  Audiences listen with
their eyes. 
		Bands are organic living things.  Relationships on large
scale.  The members need to give and take to achieve the goal. 
 
						II.
				WHY HAVE A BAND?
 
		There needs to be a point
Succesful bands have had points as varied as:   
				Women (John Lennon said the Beatles were
started to get chicks).
				Politics (Rage Against the Machine)
				Money (The Eagles)
				Personal Glory (Lady Gaga)
				Art/Expression (Dylan)
				Avoid Hoeing Cotton (Buck Owens)
				Fun (Early Red Hot Chili Peppers)
				To have a team/companionship of group
 
		The point can change
Sha Na Na was an intellectual protest.  Later it was a party nostalgia
band.
  		Know your point and work to make it. 
		Dreams shared can be dreams realized.  If you want to
play a blazing lead in a  stadium to 80
The journey is the thing but there is no journey without a destination. 
 
					III.
				LEADERS
 
	All bands have leaders.  Two types of bands are: 
 
A: Leaderless Democratic Friend oriented Jam Bands.   These bands
actually have leaders they are just hidden. 
        Things are done by consensus
break up easily.   Advantage is that all members are committed to the
group.  This is how most beginners start. 
 
B:   Bandleader with Sidemen.   More ""professional"" but less  about
group collaboration.  Sidemen move around.  The vision is with the
""leader"".   
 
	Leaders lead by example.  People will follow if you are sincere
specific
responsibility for it.   Leaders share credit. 
	The leader doesn't necessarily set the goal.  He just takes the
group towards it. 
 
 
 
					IV. 
			BAND MEMBERS
 
There are several ways to look at building a succesful group/team/band.
Here are two.
 
		A:   A band is a body.  To be a functioning body you
need 1: Head
		2: Heart
		3: Hands
		4: Feet
The Beatles: 1: John, 4. Ringo.
	John was an artist and intellectual.  Paul a heart throb and the
emotional center.   Each individually great but together
powerful. 
 
		B: This is my own theory of a band.   You need to have
these positions covered: 
	1: A Musician
	2: An Artist
	3: A Front Man/ Visual Focus	
	4: An Enthusiast
	5: A Promoter/Water Carrier
 
It is possible to have one person cover more than one position.   It is
possible to have people share a position. 
	1: A successful band really only needs one good musician.  The
more ""musicians"" the more fight for sonic space.  
	2: Artist: the guy with the vision.  The writer.  Think David
Byrne from the Talking Heads. 
	3: Front: See Roger Daltrey from the Who.
	4: Enthusiast: Paul MacArtney in the early Beatles wanted to
play wanted to progress.
	5: Water Carrier:   Charlie Watts from the Stones. Max Weinberg
for Bruce Springsteen.   Keeps it going.	 
 
					V.
			Choosing Band Members
 
A: Chemistry:   This is the key to greatness.  It's the combination.
Take out one ingredient and it don't work anymore.   See REM without
Bill Berry (the drummer). 
Music is funny.  You can play really well with people you have nothing
in common with and not be able to play at all with your best friends.
Chemistry is the magic.   You can't force it.  If you find it all you
can do is try to make it possible to continue it.  
B: Commitment: 
	Bands usually last a couple years.  People move on
babies
	The bands that are friends stay together longer
committed to each other.   
C: Bonding:   
	Any team or Band has a moment when they bond
breakfast, something that makes them a
distinct unit.   That can be artificially induced but the natural
bonding of doing something as a group
occur over time. 
D: Successful people are better in a band than great musicians.   People
who can commit to a goal and work towards it.   Better to get a bass
player who likes the idea/vision of the band and is a successful tennis
player or  4.0 academic than to get a seriously good bass player who is
just lookin' for a paycheck.   
     The tennis player can get better and will commit to the goal and
work at it. 
 
					VI.
				Equipment
 
(HE WHO OWNS THE PA
	The point of playing for an audience is for them to hear you.
In order to do that you need equipment. 
	A list of stuff you need.  
						Instruments (including
Rhythym Instruments)
						Microphones	
						Cords (extension
instrument)
						Amplifiers
						PA
						Speakers
 
						Lights (2 or 3 clamp
lights min.)
 
Optional gear.  Power Amp
T-shirts.
 
 
					VII.
		THINGS TO LOOK FOR IN BAND MEMBERS
 
Positive:   
		1: History of Success in Life (Graduated College
College ball
		2: Good people skills
people.
		3: Able to commit and work on a goal.  (Shows up for
practice.  Has a car
band)
		4: Willingness to learn and try different things.  Full
teacup thing. 
		5: Willingness to sweat. (Metaphorically and physically)
		6: Willing to move while playing.  Schtick is important.
		7: Willing to switch instruments. Changes the sound
without adding new personnel.
		8: Willing to communicate. 
 
Negative: 
		A.  Won't help load in/out. 
		B.  Get's to loaded to play.
		C.  Negativity ( ""You can't sing.   That's not the way
it's played on the record.  They suck.  We could never play there.""
		D.  Borrowing money.
		E.  No car. Needs ride all the time.
		F.  ""Star"" who won't listen to the other people while
he's playing.  Won't ever quit playing. 
 
 
 
				VII.
		       Aphorisms/Dichos
 
1.  I never make mistakes.  I play jazz sometime. 
2.  If you make a mistake
genius. 
3.  To excuse oneself is to accuse oneself.   
4.  Never Apologize to the Audience.
5.  The song is not over till the drummer stops playing.
6.  Always end a set with a Monkee's song.
7.  Sweet Potatoes are a good thing. 
8. If great things are not attempted
9.  To be free of conformity is not to spurn it
deceived by it. 
10.  Audiences Listen with their eyes. 
11.  An Audience would rather see someone have fun
play brilliantly. 
12.  They pay you to sell beer
13. Resist the temptation to put it in the middle. 
14.  Loud is only Loud in comparison to Soft.
15.  Fast is only Fast in comparison to slow.
16.  A beat is a note
17.  Art is leaving out stuff.   But you have to know it is there before
you can leave it out. 
18.   Be willing to dress up.  The band should be dressed better (or
more interestingly)  than the audience.
19.  A band is never better than it's rhythym. 
20. The song goes wrong when it's goes to far from the dance. 
21.  No wind blows in favor of a ship with no port of destination. 
 
 
 
 
					IX.
				Sonic Territory
 
Theoretical split:   Drums should play 90% of the time.
				 Bass should play 80% of the time.  
				 Vocals.... 50% of the time
				 Rhythym Guitar.... 50% of the time
				 Lead Guitar... 30% of the time. 
 
 
					X. 
				Communication
 
Work out some way of communicating with the entire band.  Facebook
phonetree (I call Greg,    E-mail.
Something.  Bands require organization and organizations require
communication. Lack of communication results in frustration and
frustration kills the band.

3. The Blues is simple. After you get the first line right

""Got a good woman with the meanest face in town. Yes

4. The Blues is not about choice. You're stuck in a ditch

5. Blues cars: Chevys, BMWs, or Sport Utility Vehicles. Most Blues transportation is a Greyhound bus or a southbound train, blues NEVER go on the northbound train. Jet aircraft and state-sponsored motor pools ain't even in the running! .

Walkin' plays a major part in the blues lifestyle.  So does fixin' to die.

6. Teenagers can't sing the Blues. They ain't fixin' to die yet. Adults sing the Blues. In Blues

7. Blues can take place in New York City but not in Hawaii or any place in Canada. Hard times in Minneapolis or Seattle is probably just clinical depression. Chicago

8. A man with male pattern baldness ain't the blues. A woman with male pattern baldness is. Breaking your leg cause you were skiing is not the blues. Breaking your leg 'cause an alligator be chomping on it is.

9. You can't have no Blues in an office or a shopping mall. The lighting is wrong. Go outside to the parking lot or sit by the dumpster.

10. Good places for the Blues:

    a. highway

    b. jailhouse

Bad places for the Blues:

    a. Nordstrom

    b. gallery openings

    c. Ivy League institutions

    d. golf courses

12. Do you have the right to sing the Blues? Yes

     a. you're older than dirt

     b. you're blind

     c. you shot a man in Memphis

Not if:

     a. you have all your teeth

     b. you were once blind but now can see

     c. the man in Memphis lived

     d. you have a 401K or trust fund

13. Blues is not a matter of color. It's a matter of bad luck. Tiger Woods cannot sing the blues. Sonny Liston could. Ugly white people also got leg up on the blues.

14. If you ask for water and your darlin' give you gasoline

     a. muddy water

     b. nasty black coffee

The following are NOT Blues beverages:

     a. Perrier

I decided to take it upon myself to post a basic guide on how to do just that. 

I'm not going to hold your hand through every step

**Who Am I?**
Why should you listen to me? Well, what the next steps for their career should be, and how they can get their name out there without breaking the bank. 

**Where to put your music**
You have 2 pretty standard options

*Soundcloud*: For whatever reason, sharing new music, etc. It's not as easy to set-up links to buy your music on here, but for embedding the player, music bloggers have been giving it a lot more love than Bandcamp recently. 

*Bandcamp*: Bandcamp is the other main platform that people have been using to release music for the last few years. It's easy to get tracks up online, shirts, etc) up for sale within a few minutes. Soundcloud doesn't offer this. For this reason alone, I recommend new bands have both a Bandcamp and Soundcloud. One to use for sending to music bloggers and those in the press and the other for selling merchandise. 

*Your Own Website*: If you're going to take this thing seriously, it's time to learn. Have a friend help you. Just figure it out. When I'm looking at new bands to work with, the website is the first place I check. You need to have links to your music on here like no tomorrow and have an easily usable music player ON THE HOMEPAGE (Use your soundcloud player).

*Reverbnation*: Don't use it. I don't care if you think it has a lot of cool features. As I mentioned about the website, I ignore it.

**Planning/Getting the word out**

You need to start thinking about your album release 6 months before it actually happens. This is for a number of reasons. 

**Print press**: (magazines) works on a 3-4 month lead time

**Shows**: 6 months before your album comes out gives you some time to start playing shows locally and remind people of your existence, or street corner that will have you. If you're new, exposure is king. You'll probably hear about how you shouldn't saturate your market. If nobody knows who you are and you're playing in 2-3 cities around your hometown, this generally won't be an issue. Play weekly and make friendly with plenty of other local bands during this window of time. 

**Local Press**: This is something you can do on your own without the help of a publicist. I guarantee that there are at least 3 local newspapers and music magazines in your metropolitan area. There are probably also some music blogs, maybe 2 or 3 (don't get pushy). Introduce yourself and see if you can buy them a beer (assuming you're of age). If you don't have the balls to invite anyone from the press to your shows, find out which shows they're going to and meet them at those ones. Introduce yourself and start to make them familiar with what you do. Please don't ever underestimate the power of local press. 

**Local++ Press**: Alright, XYZ Express, said POSITIVE PRESS QUOTE."" It doesn't matter to anyone else what you, your mom, or your bandmates think about your music. Of course you think it fucking rules. Press outlets want to know what other people think. Give them a reason to click on your links and at least give you a listen or come out to a show.

**Music Blogs**: Use hypem.com (Hype Machine) and Google Blogs to find blogs related to the type of music you play. If you take a week during your 6 month planning phase to write down the contact information of as many blogs as you can find (I generally aim to email 300-400 blogs during an album release, expect to hear back from about 5-10% of them. Remember to personalize EVERY email you send. I know it's tiring, but grab a beer and get to it. Let the blogger know you read his blog, like what he's doing, and aren't just spamming him/her and 400 other people just in hopes of getting coverage. 

**Email List**: If you've been a band for a little while already, and shows in the area, you'll see better results. 

**Flyering**: I don't care what anyone says, they're not. Flyering works because the more you do it, the more people begin to think that you've actually got something going on. It works if you're persistent and don't mind flyering for every show, event, and interesting thing you have going on. 

**Branding**: Every band needs a brand. No, fonts, and logos. Keep them the same for everything you do. 

**Images**: Since you've starting planning so far in advance of your album release (right?), but what I am saying is that you need a clear picture of your face.

**Videos**: Assuming you have the money or the know-how, images, shows, charity events, etc), the more chances you have of emailing a press outlet and getting coverage. Music videos just give you another thing to add to your roster of content and will put you above other folks in terms of preparedness. Find an iPhone, take video of the city you live in

**Social Media**: I hope this isn't news to anyone, album release dates, or music video information on it, and that you have music streaming capabilities on the page. People still use Facebook to find new music, so please for the love of God make a professional looking page. Take a look at the Black Sabbath Facebook page and see what they've got going on in terms of professionalism. They have an events tab, photos, and a cohesive brand going on. They're interacting with their fans, and keeping their page up to date. There's no excuse. You're using Reddit

**Youtube**: If you manage to get a music video online, we generally try to set up a new piece of video content every 2 weeks for about 2 months before and 2 months after an album is released. These can be covers, acoustic versions of older songs, live performances, interviews, in-studio footage, and even goofing off. The more high quality content

**Keep it local**: Yes, starting locally and getting your music into the local record stores, played in local coffee houses and thrift stores, played by local DJs, radio DJs, etc, is the easiest and most cost effective way to get started. Spend your money advertising on Youtube locally, printing up promo CDs with 2 or 3 of your best songs (or even teaming up with a few other local bands and making a best-of XYZ town CD) and leaving them anywhere and everywhere that will let you put them down, or venue. Make friends with every band in town

Building a fan base takes a long time and it's the bands that stick with it the longest that ultimately succeed. I'm sorry to tell you up front that there's a good chance no one will listen to your first album. That's not because it isn't good

Obvious throwaway. 

I have a song that was written freelance for a record label, so I'm not going to use it for my own music. 

A Solo artist in my city has just released her first track

A close source has told me that the price they paid for this producer was $30

This artist and her management have previously contacted me about a previous song of mine and wanting to acquire it. They had taken it off Soundcloud and put their own lyrics over it. I refused to let them buy it

Now to present times; they have heard the song

Her management has offered ""$$$$"" for the song. I hate all this dancing around numbers game. 

I'm thinking of asking for $2000 and 20% of the song profits (Just to cover my ass in case the song does get off the ground) does this sound too high/low?

That cost covers me recording the vocals with the artist

 I want no other involvement. 

I want no face to face meetings apart from the recording day. 

I know I can make her sound half-decent and can produce a quality sounding pop track.

Help me out?

**TL;DR Artist wants my song. Need to name a price

* EDIT 1: Here is the demo version of the song I'm selling. Obviously needs to be tightened up quite a lot.

Those of us who have been around for a while know that this statements pops up quite frequently. A common response/resolution to this issue is to tell people to downvote the things that they dislike. This is a very valid point

I originally had the downvotes removed because members were downvoting submissions that were of a music genre that they didn't like. I didn't like this idea

We have grown in size and, assuming that the posts are relatively on topic.

We use wireless pickups for several of the instruments in my band.  The new guy joins the band and doesn't have equipment he needs. We stop by a Sam Ash in Cincinnati to get one.  Normally we order online

Naturally

Then his tone changed when he asked if we were thinking about getting a better model.  He said that he might be able to get us store credit for the old one if we bought a new one

In the end we walked.  I told the douche that I thought he was lying to us.  He continued to refuse to give us store credit (because what we wanted to buy wasn't in stock) and wouldn't even let us order the unit we wanted to pick up later with said credit.

He kept saying: ""I'm just trying to help you guys!"".

I won't talk about what kind of haircut he had or what kind of music I'm sure he listened to.  It's not about that.  This guy claimed to be a musician and was trying his damndest to rip us off.  $100 is a lot of money when you run a business with a tight bottom line.  Let alone the principle.

Shop online...or even better

1375896281.0,1jw8tm,My tip for coming up with new music when you feel like you're in a creative rut,TheLostCaterpillar,175,29,54,"Firstly this might not be for everyone, full band

I set up my loop pedal with my guitar and play 4 consecutive notes in 4/4 time (switch that up if you want). I usually use my higher strings for the first time. 

Then I'll go down a string and come up with four consecutive notes that match the first four I played. Then I go down, until I add a bass line. 

The result is basically four new chords that probably have cool voicing due to the ability to use notes you couldn't reach by hand in a normal chord. 

I usually let it play out for a bit and try to sing or solo over it

The song isn't done then but now I have a new idea, and ideas about where to take the song. 

Example (not that great): On high e string in 4/4 time, E, D. Then go to your b string and play D, E, C, A. Then continue on and on. (Just an example). 

**TL;DR** Come up with a chord progression note by note, and you have some new ideas.

I have decided to switch my focus over to Bandcamp. I can release tracks and EP's with a 'Name Your Price Download'. The money from these releases goes directly to a paypal account under my name. I am going to try this out for a while as I forget about these labels. The downside to this is that I lose the promotional power that labels have (facebook followers/blog posts/email lists/whatever)

Is this making sense at all?

Could be fun. Could be hilarious. Coudl turn into a true long-distance collaboration.

I don't want to say, because I find that's often moer limiting than anything. But I play a lot of vintage-style Americana, I'm big on tight harmonies, I love catchy hooks, and I love bands with male AND female vocals. And I do love the Beatles (I only mention them specifically because there were three different guys singing songs they wrote, even they were all in the same band ... and that's kind of the same thing I'd be talking about with this project. Except that each singer/songwriter would have his/her own set of three other Beatles there to perform with).

As you can tell from my rambling, we can start thinking about a band name and get this thing going.

Okay, good.

Now that the know-it-all's are gone, I'm gonna do it in a step-by-step process. Some of these steps, you have already done, so don't be all like, ""Hey, mynameisnotjonas, I've done that already!"" Think of it as progress you have already made. Here are the steps you should take:

1. **Be good.** Be really, label, manager, press or promoter is going to want to touch you with a ten-foot pole unless you have something good to offer. Make damn sure you're happy with your sound. And make sure there are enough songs for a 20+ minute set. 

2. **Play local gigs, but this is crucial. I'm not going to go into what you need to do in order to book a show, but if you'd like to get info on that, PM me. This step is assuming that you already secured a gig. Play whatever gigs you do, and win as many fans over as possible. Stick around after the show, talk to some of the attendees, and establish relationships with them. If they like you, and they will tell people to book you.

3. **Branch out to shows beyond your hometown.** You're not gonna get to doing a full-on tour yet, San Diego, Fresno, Oakland, etc. Treat every show like it's a home show. 

4. **If your band rakes in considerable profit, then you don't need a manager. But if it is economically wise, then do it. Managers typically get paid 15-20% of a band's earnings, so don't hire a manager if your band gets paid $50 for a gig. That's just stupid. And may I add, if your band keeps growing, this is the guy who will find you guys a label and a booking agent. Not just that, but he also handles the financing side of it by covering expenses such as gas, and each member's per diem rate. Make sure you hire somebody who is ready to take on those duties. 

5. This is the last step

&gt;**Murphy's Law (if anything *can* go wrong, you might get a flat tire on the way to Chicago and be forced to cancel a show at the Metro. Bad things *will* happen. But remember that it is never the end of the world. Unless the Apocalypse happens, in which case, you're doomed.

Here's an exercise that's all about controlling your timing

Now try 2 notes per beat. Try 1 note per beat. If it's hard work to settle into the click

Practicing with a metronome is hands down the best way to improve your rhythm. There comes a point where the click is no longer a rigid guide

1316903982.0,kqdom,How to solicit useful advice/input on your music.,otherwiseyep,148,17,26,"In response to a lot of stuff lately...

- First

- However, if you ask them to rate the songs from best to least favorite, or if you ask them whether the guitars are too loud, or if the song sounds too static and needs a key change. 

- Protip: asking people which aspects sound most/least ""professional"" can give them permission to tell you what you want to know

- **If you want useful input, but there might be something a little off about the way the bass was recorded."" Musician immediately launches a lecture on how they were going for a McCartney/Jamerson-style ""expressive"" bassline to get that vintage feel and how they used flatwound strings and the counterpoint of the bass blah, blah, blah... Listener replies, ""Oh yeah, I see what you mean."" This person is merely being polite. They were on the verge of telling you something useful, but you just shut them up to satisfy your ego. Don't do that. That's why you only ever get bland ""sounds great""-style input.

- Please, to phrase the request this way. The musician is hoping to hear, ""That's the best thing I've ever heard!"", but is hedging their bets by announcing it doesn't really matter. It's just begging for a bland response.

- If you **do** genuinely want feedback/input on something that is half-finished or that you're working on/struggling with, and how it's *supposed* to echo the oppression and monotony of modern life, or whatever. It's like, oh, okay, so you are *purposely* writing music that is meant to sound like boring drudgery. Congrats, you have succeeded. Hit the nail on the head. 

- **There is NOTHING AT ALL wrong with needing a little validation/support/encouragement.** That's what friends are for, and a little disingenuous. Instead, say something like ""I'm feeling really overwhelmed/discouraged/down, and I need to know whether this is a complete waste of time. Believe me, I know this isn't perfect, but I'm going a little crazy and need someone to tell me whether there is anything here worth working on."" This is vastly better than ""be gentle"" or ""keep in mind it's not finished"" or anything like that. 

- To that last point, and then tell me what you think of the pretend song. It's fine to ask for input on unfinished work or raw ideas, but make it clear that you are asking for input on what currently exists, not what it will be when it's done. You can ask people whether a vacant lot is in a good location, etc, but asking them to pretend that it's landscaped with a dream house on it, and then asking them what they think of the house is delusional.

I'm going to go ahead and give some background. I'm a jazz guy, alternative, funk, gospel, hip hop, blues, gypsy, but I call jazz home.  I also double on flute and clarinet.

Jazz isn't a genre dominated by the singer-songwriter types or dreams of making it big.  It has a fairly small audience and a wide variety of sub genres. It can be complex and heady, and ultimately, you can tell. That's cocky and arrogant, but hear me out.

Now here's what I want to say:  practice your goddam instruments. I hope it's an issue exclusive to my city, etc. that are completed limited by the fact that they can barely play their instruments. I'm not demanding that you be the next Joe Pass, but shit guys, get it together.

By hanging out with musicians who don't know my background while staying under the radar

You hear the guys talking about being able to play guitar

Even better, etc to us. In case you're not aware, the vast majority of studio players and session artists have a jazz education. Jazz might introduce flexibility, but more importantly, it makes you learn how to really play your instrument.  We earn the gigs because we practice out asses off. Not because we have a cool band name and tshirts.

The last thing that comes to mind at the moment is more aimed towards horn players: unless you're actively studying and practicing a horn

In conclusion (and in my defense)

TL;DR: Practice makes perfect.

Edit: That's a pretty lame TL;DR. As pointed out, just competence. As predicted, some of you took offense. My apologies.

Edit 2: I'm not claiming jazz is the only genre with musicians very proficient on their instruments, also have a large percentage of skilled instrumentalists. Obviously other genres do as well, but they seem more afflicted by the aforementioned issue.

Edit 3: I just wanted to shoot down a counter argument that some people are trying to formulate- being self taught DOES NOT means someone hasn't spent hours practicing their craft. Self teaching leads to unorthodox habits and often innovation,False,,t5_2qmah,1340402080.0,,,t3_vf9yk

Lately

What would you think of a full-on pop music writing challenge on Reddit?

* We could suggest artists that would be interested in songs from other people and choose two or three of them. It could be anyone from an aspiring artist to a superstar. We could even ask help from other Redditors if we hit front page with our challenge idea. 

* The writing phase could be a mix of contest and collaboration between Redditors. For example, my English is not perfect. Maybe someone could give me a hand with the lyrics if needed. 

* We could publish the results on Soundcloud and hit frontpage to show our work to other Redditors. And

I’ve seen Reddit do awesome things in the past and the idea of holding a friendly contest could yield awesome results. But the important thing here is to have fun and practice our songwriting skills.  And who knows

What do you think?

**Edit:** Questions about musical direction and organization are starting to pop-up in the comments and my mailbox

* Regarding musical direction

* Regarding organization, recording an analog bassline, replacing the vocals, adding back vocals, etc.). Since everyone works differently, I think we could let the ""teams"" find their own way of collaborating using the tools they choose. 

Eventually, airplay, etc.). I suggest we let things flow for a couple of hours. Fell free to come up with any suggestions.

**Edit**: I don't see a definite timeframe for this project. What I'd like though

There are many paths to becoming a paid musician, I have tried to condense what I have into this post. I hope you find it helpful…

1)	**Your Product**

a.	Your music is your product. You are (in addition to being the manufacturer) the lead sales representative for your product. This follows all of the rules that a normal product would follow to make money (you have a product

b.	Your product must be at a quality that people want to buy. This means professional sounding recordings, a DIY bedroom recording is not going to cut it as a sellable product. Go to a studio, find someone with experience and pay them the money to help you. (sidenote, always haggle with these people, they will ask for a budget, tell them your budget and then come back later with half the budget.

E-flat comes back the next night in a three-piece suit with nicely shined shoes. The bartender says, E-flat soon takes off his suit and everything else, and is au natural.

Okay. Enough examples. So what have I tried (besides manually chopping and shifting my vocal tracks)? So far

* **[iZotope Stutter Edit](http://www.izotope.com/products/audio/stutteredit/)** $249: I've had some limited success with this one. It offers a lot of options and a pretty big variety of sounds. It's also midi triggered- each of the effects within a given preset is associated with a specific MIDI note. This makes triggering the effects pretty simple. Unfortunately
* **[Sugar Bytes Effectrix](http://sugar-bytes.de/content/products/Effectrix/index.php)** $129 - This one works decently with vocals. A lot of the presets mangle things too much but it still has quite a few that work. The UI is not very good though. Effects can be triggered in one of 2 ways: (1) using a pattern editor (that's synced to the project timeline) or (2) using MIDI. The problem with the pattern editor is that you can only get 12 patterns per instance of the VST- so if you want to do a lot of processing
* **[dblue Glitch](http://illformed.org/plugins/glitch/)** $0: This one seems to have great potential- both from what people say about it and from what I've been able to hear. Unfortunately though it doesn't quite work for me. When I add it as an Insert on a track, as many of the options are named vaguely (ex. ""Rand FX 7"").

There are some other plugs that I've read about but haven't spent much time playing with yet:

* **[Sugar Bytes Turnado](http://www.sugar-bytes.de/content/products/Turnado/index.php)** $179: I've only just installed this VST recently so I can't comment on it yet. It sounds like it has some neat effects
* **[Native Instruments - The Finger](http://www.native-instruments.com/#/en/products/producer/powered-by-kore/the-finger/)** $79 - I haven't tried this one yet simply because the demos NI posted don't sound any different from *Stutter Edit* or *Effectrix*. Since I already own those
* **[Image Line's Gross Beat](http://www.image-line.com/documents/grossbeat.html)** $99: From the makers of the much-beloved FL Studio. Haven't tried this one yet but after going through IL's demos I am interested in giving it a try. The UI seems at least as good as any of the other ones I've mentioned and the demo sounds are promising.

And

Which plug-ins or techniques have you guys used? I'd love to hear about them.

Check the video out for the features. My favourite is probably the WAV mode. You can run audio files through the synth instead of playing live. Got a recording of a trombone part? Synth it up!

info@strongerthanthestorm.com

Dear STTS
I recently saw the contest you are running to find the Jersey Shore's official song of the summer.  As a life long New Jersey resident and a local musician I was interested

As far as I can tell from the website, and shoot a video for the song, and then give you non-exclusive, irrevocable rights to the song, as well as forfeit all proceeds generated in this context by the song.  As a prize for winning this contest, the winner gets to perform (for free and at your discretion) opening for an unnamed band.  

While I understand this is a campaign to help restore tourism and business to New Jersey, not to mention a lifetime of training, practice and dedication.  Exposure and being recognized for artistic output are very nice things, but they do not feed my family or pay my mortgage (or taxes...this is New Jersey after all).  

I am sure there are many people who will enter this contest, a nice guitar (think a “made in the U.S.A.” Fender, or Gibson Les Paul) signed by the headlining act, and reasonable compensation for the opening performance slot is all it would take to make this contest a really great thing for a struggling musician.  

I hope this email doesn't come across as cynical or jaded.  If I have misunderstood the terms or any aspect of this contest please forgive me and feel free to correct me (I am a musician not a lawyer

Best of luck
