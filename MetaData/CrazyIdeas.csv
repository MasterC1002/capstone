1370445381.0,1fq3z0,A Sims crossed with GTA MMORPG with realistic breeding.,Expir,1176,270,123,"Ok so my idea for this game revolves around this unique selling point:

&gt;To join the game you must be 'born', and the mother must carry you around for 7 days (I thought a realistic 9 months would be a bit too far).

&gt; There is a 50% chance of being a boy or a girl.

&gt; The players who conceive the child get to name it

&gt; Your parents can choose to aid you or not

&gt; Each woman is limited to 15 children

The game would hereby be made exclusive, the baby would just gestate in the womb.

Players would have all kinds if different 'needs' meters, players would need to fulfill dark desires, be it through crime, having an affair, etc.

**Now for the good part.**

Like a modern-day Godfather, but not easily, it's much easier to smash your neighbor over the head with a frying pan that you got from the stove. Prepare for the police to come and gun you down though if you're not discreet enough.

Remember house building in the Sims? That'd be here too, as in reality there will be more people than jobs, so some people will be forced to a life of beggarism (?) or crime.

Anyone played puzzle pirates? No? Well 'working' would essentially be playing minigames. That sounds boring as shit. Well if you want to become a prostitute there is a minigame for that (and boy would it be graphic).

You will be born as a child and be forced to undergo a tutorial

The richest players would be able to build skyscrapers

A few extra points:

* To kick-off the game

* They would pick who to give their child invite to (this would only be in the early stages

* The map would be reset after alpha but the players would remain

* Dying would cause you a lengthy medical bill

* Public service jobs such as policemen would be available to players, he wouldn't remain on the force for long, but damn it'd be realistic.

* You can steal from other player's houses, and obviously you can get caught and be imprisoned.

* Players will have skills

* Once a realm is full the men will shoot blanks and the women's ovaries will be more barren than the Sahara. Until of course people begin deleting their characters

* This would definitely be subscription based

* Parents can petition for a child to be 'disowned', just a different family).

* Surely the game would be named 'OH THE HUMANITY!'

* The children will look like a cross between the parents

**If I had the chance to play this game, we'd make friends with other families, then form a neighborhood watch, which would involve us stealing things and pretending we have no idea who the culprit was. This would of course continue until I was cruising around town in a merc popping caps out of the window, immune from the law due to me bribing the police.**

I thought that one way to achieve this would be to have Redditors uploading recordings themselves singing various notes / sounds, whether that be just manually compositing the audio clips together (in a digital audio workstation) to make a complete song, or making the choir playable on an electronic keyboard.

I've even come up with a plan to achieve this. Here's how it would go down.

##1. Crowdsourced Recording

Via /r/music, etc.) clips of themselves recording the following sounds:

**a**. Tonal Sounds

i. *High Priority Tonal Sounds*

""ah"", ""oh"", ""oo"", ""uuh"", ""mm"", ""nn"", ""rr""

ii. *Low Priority Tonal Sounds*

""rr""

**b**. Atonal Sounds (only need one recording of each

""ss"", ""k"", ""j"", ""ch"", ""sh"", ""b"", ""f"", ""g""

(suggestions welcome on this list of required sounds)

Each Redditor would then create
    
    &lt;username&gt;.zip
    --tonal
    ----ah
    ------A4.wav
    ------Bb4.wav
    ------B4.wav
    ------C5.wav
    ------Cs5.wav
    ------ (etc.)
    ----eh
    ------A4.wav
    ------(...)
    ----(...)
    --atonal
    ----ss.wav
    ----p.wav
    ----(...)

Of course

The original post would probably need to state something to the effect of ""please upvote for visibility; this is a self-post

##2. Verifying the Recordings

While the above step is in progress

All the experts would then be given access to the recordings (which would be PM'd to the coordinator of this effort

##3. Releasing the Recordings

Once an archive has been approved in step 2

##4. Usage

Any Redditor will be free to download and use the raw

- The samples are compiled into a patch for use in the Kontakt sampling engine
- The samples are compiled into a soundsource for use in Spectrasonics Omnisphere
- The samples are combined with + without reverb into one master archive called ""choir.zip"" which features all the Redditors combined

I want to see handwriting become the professional standard for the internet in the near future, and then all their comments and creations, on the internet, will be submitted in their own handwriting. We could have moderation so that way people don't have penises for letters or so that all letters come out correct. And one can edit their own kerning (horizontal spacing) for their own handwriting to look as close as possible to their actual writing. It would personalize content on the internet a lot more than it currently is, and remove the unpersonal feel that the internet has. You could get to know a user a lot more from their handwriting, as you read the things that they post. People could be encouraged to focused on fixing their handwriting too, if that is really such a problem.

* The player:	

You are a spy given secret missions. You enter the game by jumping out of a cargo plane over the city.  You deploy your parachute and land on the ground with nothing but the clothes on your back

During the game you plant bugs, etc.  At some point in the game you are contacted by the KGB and offered a deal to become a double agent.  The player controls which missions they take, allying themselves with MI6, the CIA, or the KGB.  The missions you take affects the outcome of the game.  And of course, you fall in love with a beautiful enemy spy and are forced to make decisions regarding her.

* The city: 

It would probably be best to change the name of the city, West Berlin has the razzle-dazzle of neon lights and gaudy billboard advertising; East Berlin is dominated by dull gray apartment blocs, shitty communist cars, and impressive communist statues.

West Berlin is totally contained within communist East Germany.  This gives the gameplay world natural borders

* The radio:

Propaganda Radio is played by both sides.  Of course they would both be really satirical. There is a Voice of the USA radio station that rails against the evil communists and their accessible heath care. The USA DJ is Laslow's father (voiced by the actor that does Laslow).  The USSR Radio is DJ has a thick Soviet accent and is excited that bread lines are now 30% shorter throughout the city!  There could also be a swing music radio station, etc...

1370703460.0,1fxeyz,My crazy movie adaptation idea,ActingPower,120,13,14,"Okay

1. Write a series of 5 basically unrelated stories. (1st is fantasy, 4th is romance, 5th is sci-fi.)

2. Characters in the stories are one-note archetypes. (The Hero, The Mysterious Hermit, etc.)

3. Make each book into a movie

4. The first movie is played out exactly like the first book. No changes to the plot

5. In the second movie, his best friend betrays him again, he meets the same hermit, etc. He intimates that he's the same guy as the last story, but other than that, he doesn't try to change the plot.

6. Now he really starts to freak out. He's going through another story again, he starts to predict what will happen based off of these archetypes and change the plot of the story. When his ""best friend"" invites him over to his house, he refuses, since he knows it's a trap. His character has no reason to believe that, but he knows just from who his best friend is that it'll happen. (And it did in the original story.) Maybe he has a steady girlfriend, but he meets the Love Interest and starts to get confused. He's not supposed to start falling in love with her until later, but the story foreshadows her early on. Now that the Hero sees the foreshadowing, besides a few choices

7. I chose to make the romance 4th because it'd be hilariously easy to derail. In the original story, he knows he loves her. She's the Love Interest, after all. It's destiny. So this will probably be the movie where he really buckles down and tries to understand what's going on. Against the backdrop of the original story, he explores what he recognizes from the previous three movies. Maybe something that was supposed to happen, like a car accident, happens in a different context, so things start changing wildly.

8. This is the movie where I imagine the character just completely derails it. In the original book, so he shoots the guy in the face on page 1. But the guy was a big deal, so now The Hero's a fugitive, the original plot is in tatters, and everything is in chaos. Maybe the final movie ends with him getting shot, releasing him from his continuous loops.

There can be obstacles on a course where people are just allowed to get drunk and do crazy shit. some days you could have drunk olympics or obstacle courses

there will also be stadium seating where people can watch and get drunk, pay a fee, and don the equipment and act stupid for others entertainment.

1361332894.0,18v6gx,An alarm that shatters into a thousand pieces if you don't get up and defuse it in time.,shakedown_st,77,12,15,"So I'm glad I found /r/CrazyIdeas because I have had this one for many years.

An alarm clock that ""explodes"" into a thousand tiny pieces if you don't get up and defuse it in time. Why? Because too many people have the problem where they just keep hitting snooze for like an hour. This alarm clock will make sure you get your ass out of bed with adrenaline rushing so you are wide awake.

The alarm clock should be reasonably expensive since it'll be a ""one-and-done"" thing if it explodes. If it's cheap, then you don't want it to go to waste. Secondly, no one will want to have to pick up 1000 pieces of scattered across the room. Better to defuse the clock.

To defuse the clock

And I believe it would genuinely work and wake a person up out of bed. It would probably be fun too. In the beginning at least. Then you might get bored and your alarm clock explodes and you get all pissed off. Then you buy another one.
