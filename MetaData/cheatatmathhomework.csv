1297107337.0,fh174,Dear CheatAtMathHomework...,SenseiCAY,26,4,16,"I have a request for frequent submitters on this board. I hate to get on a soapbox/high horse/what-have-you and lecture

From high school onwards (it's been 10 and a half years since I started high school), a private math tutor, a swim coach, and an instructor for a college programming class. I majored in computer science with a minor in math in college. Suffice to say, I love math, and I love to teach others about various things, including math. I don't claim to be great at math, by any stretch of the imagination

I love to see a concept just ""click"" for students, I've forgotten how to do certain problems on exams or contests, but I managed to find a solution through a little bit of lateral thinking. As an instructor, I absolutely hated seeing an e-mail with the subject line ""Help"" and the body saying something like, ""Where do I start on this problem/program,"" especially if that person had been skipping class or had a habit of asking that question.

I think Reddit (and the internet in general) is a great tool for asking for help, find someone who is knowledgeable about your topic. If you want to ask for help, though, don't be like this guy:

http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fgloj/help_hw_due_in_2_hours/

...or this guy...

http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fgu3e/find_the_area_of_these_figures_for_me/

Rather, like this guy (yes, I up-voted this one for effort):

http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/fghcs/need_help_with_a_precalculus_problem/

In conclusion, not only because teaching towards standardized tests can discourage students from exploring the beauty that is inherent in mathematics and science, but because many students are afraid to try different approaches to solving problems. I'll leave you with the following thought. Most of my students in my programming class were majoring in mechanical, aerospace, or nuclear engineering. In the real world, a failure on the job could result in catastrophe. On an in-class program, if they didn't know where to start, they could save their work

Good luck to you all

We have been able to understand it enough to figure out that:

Because of polar coordinates of vectors and stuff.

However

Rearranging the first equation (the one from the video) gives

 ln(-1) = i pi

And when I type ln(-1) into my calculator it tells me that it equals i pi. This agrees with the formula. However

ln(1) = i 2 pi

If we do this with all possible permutations (eg fabcde=100000f+10000a+1000b+100c+10d+e) and sum up all of those integers, we obtain (111,111)(a+b+c+d+e+f). And 37 divides 111,111.

The volume V cm^3 of water in a container at time t seconds

V = (1/3)(x+3)^3 - 9

(a) Find the rate at which the water level is increasing after 5 seconds if water flows into the container at 1.2cm^3 /s

(b) Find the rate of change of the area of the surface of the water after 5 seconds if water is still flowing into the container at 1.2cm^3 /s.

For a, sort of. I have V = 1.2(t), which at 5 seconds would be 6cm^3 /s, so I set that equal to V in the original equation and get 0 = (x+3)^3 - 45. Looking it up on Wolfram|Alpha, the only real root there is 0.56, which when plugged into the derivative formula, I get 0.095, as how on earth would I get 0.56 as a root non-algebraically.

(b), but the former, dA/dx, I can't get. I need to take the derivative of the surface area with respect to x, but I have no formula! I don't even know the shape. (The answer is 0.6747cm^2 /s)

The problem:

An event has a base probability (p) of happening on any given time step (t). This base probability is increased by a constant value equal to x times the number of time steps since the last time the event happened.  Assuming an infinite number of time steps

For example, if the event happened during the first time step, there's still a 75% chance of it happening. If it *didn't* happen, there's an 80% chance of it happening. At t=2, there's the following probability map:

    0  1 
    y  y  = 75% 
    y  n  = 80%
    n  n  = 85%

Then

    0  1  2 
    y  y  y = 75% 
    y  y  n = 80%
    y  n  n = 85%
    n  n  n = 90%
    y  n  y = 75%
    n  y  y = 75%
    n  n  y = 75%
    
At t=4 and beyond

Brute forcing the problem programmatically (averaging number of times the event happens per time step over a large number of time steps)

If p is lower

    base         actual
    p = 0.00     0.15958
    p = 0.05     0.19021
    p = 0.25     0.33055
    p = 0.50     0.53631

This is how I would solve it:

A = l * w

60 = 10 * w

w = 6

A' = l' * w'

68.25 = (10 + e) * (6 + e)

68.25 = 60 + 16e + e^2

What I've got:

Since the nilradical is the intersection of prime ideals, which is the product of the individual prime ideals each to that power n - zero is a product of powers of prime ideals.  Then taking the product of these powers of the prime ideals minimal with respect to inclusion (there's probably a better way to filter out the unneeded ones) will also give zero.

1343851926.0,xiv93,Traveling to Andromeda in twenty years using binomial expansion and probably a rocket of some sort.,occasionalphysicist,6,1,6,"Hi there

The question below is the last question in series of four. It recommends using binomial expansion to obtain the answer. Unfortunately I haven't retained much of my knowledge of that subject from my school years so I'm posting here in hope of receiving a quick walkthrough of how it should be done in this question. I think I have the correct answer to the question from using 'my own' method of calculation. I've included the lead-in to clear up any possible sources of misunderstanding.

Assume the Earth-Andromeda distance to be exactly two million lightyears in the Earth frame

**d** Set the rocket time for the one-way trip to 20 years, which is the first two terms in the binomial expansion

(1+z)^n ≈ 1+n*z if |z|&lt;&lt;1

So as I mentioned above I didn't use that approximation

20 years in rocket frame. Space separation for rocket is 0.

Using *(earth time separation)^2* - *(earth space separation)^2* = *(interval)^2* = *(rocket time separation)^2* - *(rocket space separation)^2*

*interval*=20

*earth time*=20*sqrt(10000000001)

So now we have the time and a distance. Divide the distance by the time and you get 0.99999999995000 which is the decimal fraction of the speed of light at which the rocket would be travelling relative to the Earth frame.

I'm using log base 10 here because it's easiest to represent my question. I understand why the natural log makes the most sense for doing this because of the relationship between complex numbers and e.

I found out that log(-x) = log(x) + log(-1) (about 1.364i) if x is positive. This makes sense

log(ab) = log(a) + log(b)
log(10) = log(-2) + log(-5)
= log(2) + log(-1) + log(5) + log(-1)
= log(2) + log(5) + log(-1) + log(-1)

It seems there's two ways to evaluate this. The first way is to just evaluate each term and add. This gives 1 + 2.729i. 

The second way is to group log(-1) + log(-1) into 2log(-1) = log((-1)^2) = log(1) = 0. Evaluating it like this gives simply 1.

Here are my thoughts on the problem

It seems that lim_(n -&gt; infty) (x / (1+nx^2 )) = 0 for all x so f(x) = 0.

(f _ n '(x)) = (1-nx^2 )/(nx^2 +1)^2 so lim_(n -&gt; infty)(f _ n'(x)) = lim _ (n -&gt; infty) ( (1/n) - x^2) / (nx^2 + 2x^2 + (1/n)) ) = 0 as well.

So far it seems that g(x) = f(x) = 0.

When I look at solutions of these sort of problems it seems like the maxima of the sequences are found. By inspections of (f_n ' (x)) we see that (f_n ' (x)) = 0 when 1-nx^2 = 0 i.e. when x = +/- 1 / sqrt(n)
From plotting or a few calculations we see that the sequence takes its maxima in the positive solution.

Now

Similar calculations give that (f_n ' (x)) takes its maxima in sqrt(3/n)

The last question is the one that raised a warning flag. Assuming all my calculations are correct

So the question is: Using the determinant

        [1  a   b ]
    A = [1 a^2 b^2]
        [1 a^3 b^3]

to be non-singular.

This question is practise for calculating possible determinants

Using the diagonals we find:

det(A) = (a^2 b^3 + ab^2 + a^3 b) - (a^2 b + a^3 b^2 + ab^3 )

= ab (ab^2 + b + a^2 - a - a^2 b - b^2 )

And all of this is straight out of the textbook. The book then ignores that mess in the brackets (I'll be referring to this mess again

    a = b
So

    (a - b)

And I'm still following along fine. But then it makes this jump in logic

    det(A) = (ab)(a-b)(a-1)(b-1).

But I've expanded these factors and found that in fact expands not to D

I am working on an optics problem in the lab I work in and am running into a bit of mathematical confusion and was hoping someone could verify a theory I have about what is going on or shed light on a new one.  

In essence, I am trying to construct a transformation matrix.  

My initial methodology for constructing this matrix was to send through the simulation the two states which describe the basis,1].  In doing so, I created my transformation matrix with the output of those two states as the columns.  This works for all input states, however does not generalize as much as I'd like because it still requires the simulation.  

Next, which is a diagonal matrix of the form exp(i*t1) and exp(i*t2).  

In constructing my transformation matrix in this way, by having its indexes ""cross-swapped"", as if being multiplied on both sides by the row-exchanged version of the identity matrix (diagonal in / direction, not \ direction).

My question for you all, because after simulating the phenomenon, I end up with the light pointing antiparallel, and consequently need to ""adjust"" the results to switch its handedness back.  

In essence, but can if desired.

Which grows faster: (n!)! or ((n-1)!)!(n-1)!^n!

My first approach was to replace n-1 with n in the second formula to get (n!)!n!^(n+1)! which would clearly grow faster than than the first formula

The back of the book merely gives the solution with a small hint: Take logarithms to show that (n!)! wins.

Well ok

    log[(n!)!]

        = log[n!(n!-1)(n!-2)...(n-1)!((n-1)!-1)((n-1)!-2)...3\*2\*1]

        = log[n!(n!-1)(n!-2)...((n-1)!+2)((n-1)!+1)((n-1)!)!]

and

Assume that a tiling with no fault line exists.  Let x1, x1, x2, and x3 are all positive.  **A horizontal domino covers two squares in a row, while a vertical domino covers one square in each of two rows.  From these facts we conclude that x1, x2, and x3 are even.**  Hence

1367470967.0,1dj8tx,Graph Theory Question -- Sophomore Undergrad x-post from r/math,graphtheoryquestion,4,0,4,"So this isn't actually a homework question

My discrete mathematics course just finished a unit on graph theory

Now the obvious way to go about this is to do a proof by contradiction: Suppose there are NOT at least two vertices of degree one. Suppose there is at most one. So we have then (n-1) vertices with degree 2 and at most with degree 1. Then we have (2*(n-1)+1)/2 edges (since each edge connects two vertices). Now this works out to having n - (1/2) edges
So that wasn't bad. But I thought of a different way to prove it and was wondering -- just out of curiosity -- if it worked as well. It goes as follows:

Suppose for a contradiction T has no vertices of degree one. Then all vertices have degree greater than or equal to two. Then pick a vertex, we will be able to ""come in"" and ""come out"" since all have degree greater than or equal to two. Sooner or later we will end up back at b or at a vertex through which we have already passed. Thus T will have a cycle, which is a contradiction since we assumed T was a tree. So T must have at least one vertex of degree 1.

But now we look at the case where T has just one vertex of degree one.

Suppose for a contradiction T has just one vertex with degree one, of T where every vertex will have degree greater than or equal to 2. Vertex v must connect to some vertex in H. Call that vertex x. Now remove v. If x still has degree greater than or equal to 2, H must have a cycle (as we can imagine ourselves starting a walk at x and going into and out of each vertex until we end up at x or some other vertex where we have already walked). Since H has a cycle, T could not have been a tree and we have the desired contradiction. If x has degree one after the removal of v, then H still must have a cycle. We can see this by noting that we have a second subgraph where x connects by one vertex, call it z, to all the others. All the others must have degree greater than or equal to 2 and by the same argument must contain a cycle and again we have a contradiction. So if T has just one vertex of degree one, is not a tree

Can someone explain why the y(t)= sin(pi*9)+pi*cos(9*pi)*t function is incorrect? 

[SOLVED]

If you simplify the sin(9 * pi) you get 0 so the first equation x(t)=cos(9 * pi) 
 
For y(t) you need to change t so that at t=9 you get the equation of the given line. To do this you have to change (t) to equal (t-9) so plugged in with cos(9 * pi) simplified to -1

if we apply this change in t to z(t) we get
z(t) = 27 + 3(t-9) = 27 + 3t -27 = 3t.

So that's the reason why y(t) was false and the others were correct. Thanks for the input!",,t5_2rbfw,1364490769.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cheatatmathhomework/comments/1awdz7/parametric_equations_trouble_calc_3/

a) sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) &gt; 1

b) If n is an integer such that n^2 is even

c) If n= m^3 - m for some integer m

----------------------------------------------------------

I will rely on P - &gt; Q and not Q - &gt; not P to try and prove the above statements.

a) I think I cant use direct proof (P - &gt; Q) here, I will use contradiction.

Contradiction: not P - &gt; Q(false)

sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) ≤ 1

6- sqrt(24) + 2 ≤ 1

2sqrt(12) ≤ 3 (false statement). Negating this statement makes sqrt(6)- sqrt(2) &gt; 1 true.

b) n^2 is even - &gt; n = 2m for any integer m

If we assume not P

From here it's obvious that n should be even to avoid contradiction.

c) not P: 1+ 6m = m^3 - m where n is not a multiple of 6.

To force n to be a non-multiple of 6


1+ 6m = m^3 - m

0= m^3 - 7m -1 ( I will assume that this result is false because solving for x introduces imaginary numbers which I am not sure if I am allowed to work with).

Here is an example of what a bilge might look like. Imagine a 20x40 room where the work area is 3 ft high. So just the deck alone would be 20x40=800 square feet. Above the deck imagine that there are cubes which are all 2x3. So in a 20x40 room you would have 100 cubes with no ceiling ( as the deck plates revealing them are removed). Each cube is 2x3 thus each cubes surface area would be 30 square feet. Since there are 100 cubes this would make 3000 square feet. Thus total square footage of the bilge would be somewhere close to 3000 square feet.

So I've been given the equation 

(1 - x^2 ) y'' + xy ' = ky

I have three tasks. The first is to rewrite this differential equation in the form L_x [y] = kwy where w is a weight function and L_x is a differential operator in *self-adjoint* form. I'm then asked to show that using a substitution x = cos(t) I can rewrite the differential equation in the form

d^2 y / dt^2 = -k y

And the final problem is to solve for the k eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors

So far I think I've done the first task. My working:

First I divided the equation by (1- x^2 ) to get

y'' + [x/(1 - x^2 )] y' = -ky/(1 - x^2 ) 

Next, I fairly quickly determined w(x) to be w(x) = rt(u) = rt(1 - x^2 ).

Multiplying everything by w(x) we can now rewrite the operator in the form

-d/dx (rt(1 - x^2 ) y') = ky/(rt(1-x^2 ))

Working backwards

From y_tt = -k y

y = A cos(rt(k) t) + B sin (rt(k) t) 

from the boundary conditions we see that y is actually an even function, y(x = -1) transformed is y(t = pi), y(t = -pi).  Thus we know that A cos(rt(k) * pi) = A cos (- rt(k) * pi) = 0, so that rt(k) = (n + 1/2) -&gt; k = (n+1/2)^2 . 

However

B^2 int(-1 to 1) rt(1 - x^2 )  cos((m + 1/2)t) cos((n + 1/2)t) dx. 

As x = cost, and w(t) = sint. Thu we have the integral:

 B^2 * int(-pi to pi) sin^2 t cos((m + 1/2) t) cos((n + 1/2) t) dt = -1

I have no idea how to evaluate this integral though! I'm aware that n must equal m for the integral to be normalised but I'm totally sure it's not right. Can anyone point me in the right direction?

The fact that the answer to this math problem was a smaller number than the length of the side was simply impossibly wrong in her mind.

I told her just to trust the math &amp; not worry about understanding 'why' or having it make sense

So here is what I have so far...

1. I know that the subgroups of a group have orders corresponding to the divisors of the order of the group (if |G|=12,3,4,6, and 12), so this would mean that if there is only one nontrivial proper subgroup (only one of them has more than one element), then |G| must be a prime number (call it p) squared so that its only divisors (and thus the orders of its subgroups) are either 1 or p (it can't be p^2 otherwise it isn't a proper subgroup). This would make it have only trivial subgroups or subgroups of a single other order (namely p).

As for the showing that it is cyclic part I don't have very much to go on yet. Any revisions that can be offered to my reasoning above would be appreciated and any insight into the cyclic part of the problem would also be great!

2. I have no idea where to start on this :)

3. Based on a google search

For instance, and so for (a^2 )^3 = a^6 = (a^3 )^2 = (e)^2 = e thus |a^2 | = 3 also.

C'(t) = F(x,y,z). Also, V(x,y,z)=V(C(t)).

We have d/dt (V(c(t)) = (del)V(C(t))*C'(t), V(C(t)) should be found by integrating. int(e^2t)dt = (1/2)e^2t. Evaluating at t=3 we have V(C(3)) = V(0,1,0) = (1/2)e^6.

The Pareto Condition states that ""if every voter prefers candidate X over candidate Y

1) Does the plurality method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition? Explain.
The plurality method states that you count the first place votes for each candidate and the one with the most votes for first place wins. The Pareto Condition states that if every voter prefers candidate X over candidate Y, then there is no possible way that candidate Y could have more first place votes, thus making the plurality method satisfy the Pareto Condition.

2) Does the Borda count method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition? Explain.
The best method of figuring out if a voting method satisfies a fairness condition is to try and form an instance in which that voting method violates it. If you are able to make one, it satisfies it. Although that is true, I found the logic of the rules to be fairly straight forward with the Borda Count method and the Pareto Condition. Because the Borda Count method is based of off the logic that the candidate that is generally preferred (not necessarily with the most 1st place votes) will always win. Due to the strict rules of the Pareto Condition (if every voter prefers X over Y, then Y should not win) there is no way that a candidate who is generally less preferred than another candidate could beat that candidate.

3) Does the plurality with elimination method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition?
When using plurality with elimination method you count the first place votes, like the normal plurality method, if one candidate is preferred over another candidate by every voter, it would be impossible for that less preferred candidate to win.

4) Does the pair-wise voting method satisfy or violate the Pareto Condition? Explain.
In a pair-wise voting method each candidate is paired head-to-head with every other candidate. 1 point is received for a win and ½ point is received for a tie. The points are added up and the candidate with the most points wins. Again

*TL:DR* All four methods satisfy the Pareto Condition.

**EDIT** I TeXed it up for you.

Let A be a 2x2 matrix (not necessarily diagonalizable) and define

`[;\begin{bmatrix} x_n\\ y_n\\ \end{bmatrix} =A^n \begin{bmatrix} 1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};]`

Assume `[;\lim_{n\to \infty}(\frac{x_n}{y_n})=1;]`

Show that `\begin{bmatrix} 1\ \ 1\ \ \end{bmatrix}` is an eigenvector of A.

Hint: explain why we can find `[;c_1,  c_4;]` with

`[;A\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix}=c_1\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix}+c_2\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};   A\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix}=c_3\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix}+c_4\begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};]`

What do you need to show about `[;c_1, c_4;]` so that `[;\begin{bmatrix}1\\1\\ \end{bmatrix};]` is an eigenvector of A?

Now compute `[;A^n \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix};] and compare with [;A^{n+1} \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix}=A(A^n \begin{bmatrix}1\\2\\ \end{bmatrix});]`

I started with the hint. I suppose that for the part of the hint, 

    c_1[1] c_2[1]
       [1]    [2]

I would like to build a Markov Chain with the following characteristics:

P(x(t)=1)=1-p, try again distribution), as you go 'forward' in time (t+1,t+2, ...), the probabilities are adjusted as follows P(x(t+1)=1)=p^2 , P(x(t+1)=0)=(1-p^2 ).

I am currently reading ""A Markov-Binomial Distribution"" by Omey, P(x=1)~1, so this should be a very fairly small chain, with desirable characteristics. Whether the probabilities do not match the convention [P(x(t)=1)=1-p instead of the usual P(x(t)=1)=p], is currently irrelevant, I want the success to be marked when x=1, and the probability of that outcome being ""forced"" by (1-p^2 ).
