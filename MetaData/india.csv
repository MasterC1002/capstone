1360996065.0,18mkwq,Do your bit to make /r/india a friendlier place! (Please upvote for visibility),Reddictor,276,61,159,"Hi /r/india! 

The most common complaints about /r/india arise because of it's culture. Downvoting, from the cesspool of comments on a particular thread.

Nevertheless, and _spokesperson accounts. How can we nurture and sustain this delicate green shoot of civil discussion? Here are some guidelines, adapted from [reddit's ettiquette guide.](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

###1. The downvote is not a ""dislike"" button
Please do not downvote a post or a comment only because you think it's wrong

Downvote **posts** if you think these kinds of posts do not belong on /r/india, and links to FB flamewars are good examples of posts which I would downvote. 

Downvote **comments** if you think it is harmful to the discussion. Rude attacks on other users, but many times I have upvoted comments which support him because many people have different opinions, and I respect that. 

###2. Redditors are real people too!
This is an anonymous internet forum, likes and dislikes. So before you call someone an idiot, retard, chaddi, Congie, etc., please think: would you do this to a real person in your life? What makes you think it's okay to do that to people on reddit? 

###3. /r/india is mainly what users make it
A subreddit is mainly determined by what its users do. If you want more self posts, ~~downvote~~ IGNORE politics posts, and submit and upvote more non-political content.     
If you are not okay with insults and rudeness

----

tl;dr: The next time you feel an urge to downvote someone politely saying something about Modi, SRK, or how your hometown sucks, please DON'T. Even worse, don't insult them for their opinion. _Explain_ why you disagree, instead.

",51,202,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/tl0ux/rant_the_indian_culture/,"Do you know that feeling when you're playing a race game on the computer, against the computer and on the highest level? If you're a novice gamer, the experience is nothing but a never ending story of trying to catch up with the computer player. Trying to catch up. Trying to catch up. Trying to catch up and just that.

The above scenario reminds me of a Social Science chapter I had in school three years ago. It was about the Industrial revolution that took place in Europe in the 19th century and the challenges that were faced by the people in coping up with all the new kinds of machines and gadgetry.

I believe India is going through one such revolution right now.
 
Let's just call it a cultural revolution for brevity's sake, this revolution might also have a billion varieties and types and segments and reservations and quotas.

All I'm trying to say here, everything around us: our culture, the way we speak, dress, talk, communicate - is changing. Rapidly.

Now saying 'rapidly' is relative. Let's discuss this relativity.

Take my father for example. He's just one generation - one hierarchy level - above me.
 
In his time, mundane clothes, went about their jobs and ... I don't know. I didn't live in that time, but they were mostly non susceptible to a variety of cultural changes every day. Why? Because MTV, Bindass, Discovery and Google.

Let's talk about today.

I'm 18. I can speak English. I know plenty about the world (which in itself is subjective). I can speak English. I can use computers and I can find the answer to any question using a search engine like Google. 

I know plenty about sex.

But my parents never told me about it.

Which makes sex-talk with parents a very awkward time

——

I have a beef with older generations. Yes

I grew up with a generation gap. A lot of it. There are several things I just simply don't understand about older people.

I want to know how they expect a boy or girl going through puberty to know about all the changes going on in him or her. That stuff isn't taught in school until grade ten. Now unless you have a rocket-boosted Pineal gland that delayed your puberty

Sex talk is taboo. Porn is taboo. You have a girlfriend? That's taboo. You had three boyfriends? You must be ""character less"".

Then suddenly marriage.

Oh wow

When are you getting us grandkids?

In the name of Shiva's lingam

Yes

Then you don't like the terrorists.

Basically

I'm going to put ""social terrorist"" in my goddamn resume.

——
The current year is 2012. If some people are to be believed

But this lady in my neighbourhood would rather worry - and quite devoutly - that her daughter must not ""hang out"" with guys. That girl is 19.

I have a 20 year old female friend in South India. She would rather not tell her parents that she's dating.

A good male friend of mine

I know twenty five year old guys who would rather not discuss their relationships with their parents. Or the fact they they ARE in a relationship.

And then I got threatened with my legs (to be chopped off and thrown in the river) when my first girlfriend's mom found her talking to A BOY! Oh god

Dear older generations, but acting on the simple biological response brought forward by their hormones, do you have to be all Bruce Willis-yippi-ki-yay-kiddo! on them?

You love your kids. You know they love you back. But you don't want to hear that your kids might like other people too.

Oh god you sure are a selfish bunch.

——

Here's a fact. If you hide something from somebody for too long and especially make them know that they won't get to see it

That reminds of Delhi.

No, groping, eve teasing.  

I'm pretty sure that most people who rape others haven't had sex before, ""Haivaani raakshas"" son. That rapist son would probably have had the kind of upbringing where he was not allowed to hang out with girls, where, in his own home, women were berated, objectified, degraded and given the least magnitude of respect. Where, he was taught that ""ladkiyan to parayi hoti hai"" and that ""jaa beta

But I quote India TV again

I do not condone rape. I do not condone any such vicious actions. I

——

The teacher.

The teacher is ""Indian Culture""

If I had the chair of the Prime Minister
I would cancel the license of any news or entertainment channel that passed of it's anchor's views as ""Indian Culture"".

Oh wait

Thinking about it

However, I really hope that it can be segregated and chopped down into pies. I really don't want a pie of the ""Indian Culture"" by my name that says disgusting, meaningless, anti-scientific, anti-social and anti-freedom things such as that my female friends, those who I have known since I was 6, can't walk the street with me at 9pm wearing something as graceful as a skirt; that two people who like each other and are totally minding their own business without hurting other people physically

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that says wearing what makes me comfortable (without showing my privates) must be approved by a ""moral police"" (which, violent minded and unemployed people.) 

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that belittles people for being opinionated

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" following which schools and colleges suspend students for showing affection on-campus.

I don't want any part of ""Indian Culture"" that tags me a rebel

And lastly

If you have an ""Indian Culture"" that has none of these things

I bought her a packet of biscuits everytime I passed her for the next few months

One exhausted day I sat beside her and shared some fried rice

She stopped sitting there one day

I would place some clean water and food beside her. I used to put aside rs. 1000 a month for her, convenient commute to spend some time with my city.

I've met many people now who spend some time doing the same

I go hiking regularly to clean the route of waste and plastic

I do not bribe, I do not think about the larger scheme of things. I like honesty but I've cheated on my girlfriend a few times, and there I am a dishonest man.

The roads are always dirty

But there are always people who care for stray dogs, I've met so many people and they do so much I can never dream of achieving.

Then I read about people complaining about India, etcetera.

I've breathed the air of the Alps, then buy another car, buy a large tv, but just get out of my way.

i can't tell you how happy i am today. i just gave a presentation in front of my class. for most of you it would not be a big deal. but to tell you about this day's importance i have to go back a little in my history;

i was a very achieving student until my high school. i took part in every kind of extra curricular activities(sports, chalk or anything they could find at me. but the one thing that affected me the most was how much i hate i got whenever i went to speak in front of a mass . i was anchoring an event and whenever i would come on stage , my classmates, seniors and even juniors started screaming ""homo"" . i am very ashamed to admit that i thought about committing suicide on that night. 

i changed school and cities but could not remove the fear of crowd from my mind. For a person who has an opinion about everything under the sun

In the morning i stood before the class and was shaking like a leaf. i could feel everyone judging me. but then i looked at my friends and slowly started speaking and didn't stop . It was amazing. i felt a feeling that had gone too long from my heart. i have been jumping with joy but i can't still share it with my friends. so i am sharing it with you.please have hope if you are in a place of darkness.

This is how the conversation around me went. I was the only woman in an overnight bus full of north Indian males (going from Dehradun to Delhi) and one non-north Indian male friend

We had the option of getting off the bus, one with one or two women in the least, we were still at ISBT. But after an hour's mulling, I decided to stay and see this through. 

The five men were drunk, except my friend and I, pretended to be asleep even though the abuses and laughter were too loud for anyone to fall asleep.

The lights were switched off. I wondered when and how this would escalate

I tried to stay upright, and when and how they would start it.

I had lost my phone. My friend's phone was almost out of battery and we probably had charge enough to make just one call. I could think of only two people to call and one of those numbers I couldnt remember. So I called the one I did remember and spoke loud enough for everyone to hear. It was a small bus. 

""Hello, could you send me the number of the helpline for women in north India? Yes, it was started after the Dec incident in Delhi. Yes, online."" 

I knew there was probably no such helpline, but they stopped, by and large.

The man behind me, mere seat se aapke payr hataiye."" 

I tried to speak loudly and clearly

When the bus stopped at a dhaba in Roorkee in the middle of the night

When the bus started again, I wont leave them alone. I will search out and destroy each of them. And if I dont get back alive, there are friends who know where I am, who I know will do the exact same thing for me. Log darte hain, so yeh sochte hain kuchh bhi chalta hain.""

Then I said: ""I should start using my phone camera. Can you get on the internet now from your phone?""

The last two were bluffs. I didnt even have a phone

I sat up awake most of the night. We reached Noida safely at dawn.

Had considered not writing this down. Was a reasonably minor incident: that could have escalated

On the other hand, or nothing. 

The men would have probably joked around and fallen asleep anyway. Even if I hadnt spoken

I considered not writing it because it might sound like some weird tale of stupid bravado

I was just determined to finish that journey on that bus, I wanted to see it through. If it was more, I wanted to see how far they would go.

This is how it happened

A minor incident. Getting on a bus. Minor it should be. Then why this torrent of fear that I had to cross?

1371987785.0,1gwku1,AAP needs more love from r/india. Especially since the mainstream media essentially have a gag order.,anirbanc,172,32,82,"Copy pasting a text from their facebook page:

A newly married woman was gang-raped in the rape capital of our country (Delhi). She approached Aam Aadmi Party - Delhi. AAP volunteers immediately rushed to help her.

Delhi police were back to their old attitude &amp; refused to register an FIR. But

15 of the volunteers were arrested &amp; later presented before the magistrate. The state in which the volunteers were brought was SHOCKING. They had been beaten mercilessly. The volunteers said that police kept saying - ""Aam Aadmi Party se ho

When they asked for WATER

What was their crime ???? They all had gone to the police station ONLY to demand FIR in a gang rape case.

Arvindji has tweeted :

** In police walon ko or sarkar ko pata nahi ham kis mitti ke bane hain.

** If police or govt thinks they can threaten us or stop us like this

** Volunteers will be presented at Karkardooma at 2 pm

Today if we do not see Arnab Goswami / Rajdeep Sardesai / Rahul Kanwal / Nikhil Wagle / Rajiv Khandekar / Uday Nirgudkar taking this issue big time. They are NOT fighting for the cause

If they don't cover this......I will assume that......

* They don't care for a rape / Gang rape. They talk about it just when they have some extra time

or

* It is NOT being taken up because they have been directed NOT TO COVER Aam Aadmi Party volunteers.

* Those stupid volunteers who have made the blunder of fighting for the country.
* Those idiots who have a dream of changing their country &amp; make it a better place to live in.
* Those silly people who have defied the system by putting their life at stake
* Media cares only and only for TRP &amp; for their balance sheets which are likely to swell as we go close to 2014 (if they don't cover AAP).

I am really upset, where media is existing and yet selectively covering only the mighty and most importantly where ........ The ELITE citizens of my country care a damn for the country &amp; want their children to go to US / UK and never come back.

I am deeply distrubed............. very very disturbed

1358332309.0,16ogbd,"Of puns, Pakistan, and post removals (please upvote for visibility)",Reddictor,169,77, so here's a clarification of the rules from your friendly neighbourhood mod team.

**1. Posts which are puns on the word ""border"":**    
Saree borders, google maps of borders, the movie border... We all appreciate puns as much as the next person. What should have been a pictorial pun thread, though, became a deluge of nonsensical posts with no relation whatsoever to India. We've removed the worst offenders (a DOZEN people thought of the Allan Border pun), but let the ones remotely related to India stay.    
The next time you guys think of a hilarious pun, or TWO DOZEN seperate posts which quickly kill the joke.


**2. Posts about Pakistan:**    
We understand that the events in Pakistan have a bearing on India. However, link all the articles you want, and explain how it affects India. The same goes with articles about rape, sex, corruption, etc. etc.: If it isn't happening in India, submit as a self-post and make the effort to explain how it affects India.

**3. Marking NSFW:**    
If there's any doubt that your post might be unsafe for work, submitting pornography is NOT OKAY, even if the actors are speaking (grunting?) in Hindi or any other Indian language.

**4. Self-promotion:**    
We discourage links to your blogs because then this forum degenerates into a way to get views. If you're a new user, if you're a regular contributor, occasional links to your blog or website will be tolerated. This is inherently subjective, of course, and we will leave a message when we delete self-promoting posts.

Tl;dr: Posts not related to India even if they are very punny, and self-promotion of your own blogs will be deleted",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,False,,moderator

###1947: The state of agriculture

The biggest influence on agriculture in India today can be traced back to the British. Through centuries of destructive trade policies, they destroyed the eventual process of industrialisation, and left Indian artisans and farmers in a pitiable state. Nevertheless, there were some positives, characteristic of the British rule. The expansion of canal irrigation, which the British initiated and supported, provides irrigation to areas across the country till date. 

On the eve of independence

- Land problems:
    Most of the land was owned by landlords or moneylenders, through sale and inheritance, into very small plots of sometimes untillable sizes. Thus, most farmers were subsistence farmers, growing only enough for their own needs.

- Production problems:
    Indian farmers, yields of most crops were woefully low, due to the utter absence of any kind of technology or capital investment. 

- Financial problems:
    Most farmers were extremely poor, and cartels of traders who conspired to buy crops at lower rates. 

- Human problems:
    Agriculture, for example, nearly 4.5 million tons of food grains had to be imported, compared to the production of of about 45 million tons. The threat of famine was ever-present. Most farmers were illiterate and unaware of modern practices. The land situation was intricately tied in with the complicated and stratified rural society, making change incredibly hard.
		
###The first five year plans

The  first five year plan attempted to tackle most of these problems on a war footing. Giving the ""highest priority"" to agriculture, was to try and provide an economical livelihood for the farmers, with a degree of financial safety, while simultaneously ensuring that sufficient food was available to feed everyone in the country. 

Perhaps predictably, top-down approach was adopted: several large irrigation/hydropower dams were constructed, agricultural research institutes were founded, as were PSUs for the production of fertilisers and pesticides. ""Community development programs"" and ""agricultural extension services"" were provided throughout the country, and efforts were made to promote rural credit. 

Simultaneously, though, varied wildly from state to state. In several states, land reforms were half-heartedly implemented due to stiff political opposition from landlords. 

The first Plan was fairly successful in achieving its overall production targets. A production of 62 million tons of foodgrains was targeted
	
###Government intervention in markets
	
- PDS (Public Distribution System): The PDS was first intended to be a mechanism for ensuring minimum food supplies to cities. In a situation where famine was a real possibility, and limited supply through fair price shops, would help avoid famine. By the 1960s, the PDS had morphed into a food supply scheme at subsidised rates to the entire population. 

- MSP (Minimum Support Price): The Government announces a minimum support price for certain crops. Essentially, as any farmer who gets a lower price than the MSP, can in theory choose to sell to the Government instead. The government buys and sells food through the Food Corporation of India
	
The PDS and the MSP form the two legs of the Hercules that is the food subsidy system in India. The overall system at present operates as follows: http://i.imgur.com/3eAMM.png

		
###The Green and dietary revolutions
	
Since the PDS/MSP regime was put into place, due to the usage of high yielding varieties of crops, machinery, and chemical inputs. Thus, the overall situation of the economy was transformed from a calorie deficit to a calorie surplus economy. 
	
Everyone's heard of the green revolution, people started shifting from a cereal-intensive diet to a more diversified diet. For example, in rural India, the consumption of cereals declined by 17%, while the consumption of edible oils, dairy products, and meats increased by 45%, and 65% respectively

There is some debate on what the dietary shift implies, the absolute amount of calories consumed have reduced, which means that malnourishment has increased. What is not disputed, though, is that the change in diet has taken place, across all sections of society.
		
	
###The curious case of the rotting grains
	
Now we have all the ingredients to explain the situation.
	
- The states
- This causes the FCI to procure grain at rates higher than the open market rates for newly harvested grain. 
- The eventual sale of this grain at these higher rates ends up increasing the price of wholesale grain
- This higher price further reduces the demand for foodgrains
- In an ideal scenario, more valuable crops. However, the artificially high MSP hides the fact that there is reduced demand for foodgrains from the farmers, many of whom continue to grow foodgrains
- When there is no demand for these foodgrains
- Thus, and is forced to dispose it a huge loss.
		
Earlier, now that we have enough food in aggregate to feed ourselves. 
Of course, this means that grains in Haryana and Punjab sit idle, while BPL individuals do not benefit from the extra procured grains.

After some time of her trying to convince her parents

We formulated a plan around this. She desperately wants her parents to accept us, she was going to spend 6 months working at this contract while still trying to convince her parents. If they would still not be convinced after 6 months, she would cut ties with them and elope with me. She told me that she wanted to be with me more than anyone and that she could never dream of an arranged marriage and being forced to spend the rest of her life with another guy whom she didn't love.

Fast forward to today, I will do anything, including buying a ticket and going there to find her. She lives in Andhra Pradesh near Chittoor about 5 hours from Bangalore. Her parents have locked her in her house and taken away all forms of communication. If they keep her there, her visa will expire and she will not be able to return to the US. 

I am seeking your help r/India. What can I do to get my love back? She told me her parents are crazy to the point that they may kill her and then themselves. I cannot imagine my life without her and she cannot imagine her life without me. PLEASE HELP!

Edit: As recommended by a commenter

Edit2: I am still waiting for Love Commandos' response. I will keep you all updated. If you have any other ideas please tell me. I am very tempted to go there but I am afraid to get arrested and put into jail.

Edit3: I just received a message from her brother. He told me never to contact her again and I have no chance because of my X. I am still waiting for a reply from Love Commanders.

Edit4: Here is a picture of us https://www.dropbox.com/s/yzygxrmc20b70d3/2013-01-20%2013.11.10-1.jpg
*Picture removed*

Edit5: Love Commandos told me that action should be taken tomorrow. Direct quote from them:
""We have already started taking up the matter at the highest level in Central
Authorities may also contact you if they need. Likewise your girl friend may also contact you in due course of process. Hoping to save your love and re uniting you. Pl have patience. As action has been officially initiated they may not be able to do any harm to her or move to any undisclosed place. Other senior authorities are likely to visit your girl friend tomorrow""

Edit6: No update yet as it is 4AM in India. I will keep you all updated. Please continue to provide feedback. I will take any help I can get and I will spare no cost to bring her back.

Edit7: Still no update and I am getting worried. At around 1:30AM EST Love Commandos emailed me and told me that they expect action by late evening and they will update me. It is now 8:20AM EST and 6:49PM IST and I have not received an email. I have sent them another email requesting for an update but there has been no reply. I want to go to India but if her parents have moved her I have no way of finding her. I am panicking I have no idea what to do next.

Edit8: I just received an email from Love Commandos: ""As per last update her voluntary statement may be got recorded tomorrow afternoon. It would be followed by a judicial statement.
The authorities or your girl friend may contact you after that process. As today was a working day
I am frustrated that there is no official word of what has happened. Maybe I am used to the US where if you call the police they are at your house within 30 minutes. I am planning to secure a same day Indian visa in NYC and fly there if I do not hear from her soon. Is there anyone willing to help me once I arrive? I have no idea how to navigate India. I would be flying into Bangalore airport most likely and if anyone

Edit9: Last update at 6AM EST: "" LAST UPDATE JUST RECEIVED SAYS THAT HER VOLUNTARY STATEMENT IS BEING RECORDED. THINGS WOULD BE CLEAR LATER. IT ALL DEPENDS UPON HER STATEMENT NOW AND WHATEVER SHE WILL DESIRE THE AUTHORITIES WOULD DO ACCORDINGLY""
I am not sure I trust the police there

Edit10: Love Commandos have asked me to wait until tomorrow (IST) for a response. If I still do not have a response, PLEASE let me know. I will cover any expenses you have. Please message me here if you are willing to help. 

Edit11: I will not be going to India. She has just contacted me... her parents have made her get married. There is nothing I can do now. Thank you for all of your help. :-(

Edit12: Thank you to everyone that messaged me. Because of the large amount of people that refuse to believe I am American based on the way that my grammar is
As stated in my previous edit, her parents relocated her to another city and she was married within 48 hours. When I questioned her if the police had knocked on her door she said that the police never visited her house asking for a statement, so I am not too happy with Love Commandos, but it is a moot point. That is the long and the short of it. Again, thank you to everyone that offered their advice and went out of their way to help. I don't wish this outcome on anyone and I hope India becomes more lax in regards to parents respecting the wishes of their children.",,False,t5_2qh1q,True

The Metallica show was awesome. It gave a lot of people what they were waiting for. It even gave some folks new iPhones, the crowd’s gone, our belongings are gone and all that remain are some horrifying memories of a night that should have been epic.

Prologue:

Most of the tickets booked on the last few weeks never got delivered to their owners. Instead

What happened before the concert:

Gates open at 4:30 P.M. letting in an ocean of 25000 fans. Everyone is frisked at the main entrance, have no choice but to leave it at the ‘baggage counter’. Just like the secret ingredient in Mr. Ping’s noodle soup, The ‘baggage counter’ is NOTHING! There is no baggage counter. The master plan that DNA had cooked up left us fans gaping! They are instructed to leave their bags in an open ground (completely filled with mud), stacked one over the other. Out in the rain. Nothing to keep our belongings safe from the rain OR the muck. Left with no other option, fans decide to leave their belongings in the muck counter. Now comes the best part. DNA refuses to give tokens to the owners of the property, thereby escaping from additional responsibility and also destroying any chance of cataloging the items. So, all in all, no tokens

What happened after the concert:

Having left my backpack at the muck counter and being highly unsure about its safety, but after observing for a few minutes, we noticed some random men checking backpacks looking for heavy ones and waking away with them. Worse, little kids were opening the backpacks in situ and pulling out headphones, goggles and iPods out of bags and walking away. There was not a single cop stationed at the spot. One security guard was present, taking care of about one thousand bags and dealing with about the same number of exasperated people.

Now

What happened next:

Having unsuccessfully searched for our belongings for over 2 hours, caught him and brought him to the crowd, introducing him as the solution to our problem. Soon, angry fans spotted another guy doing the same, and caught him as well. The two gentlemen were turned over to the cops, who started shouting and swearing to the crowd about how they should not have brought their backpacks to the venue. The cops roughened up the suspects a bit and took them to the High Grounds police station, without a word to the stranded fans. No information was given about what was to happen to them, another fan spots a guy sneaking into an adjacent wedding hall with a backpack. A few people follow him into the hall and find a stash of 15 empty backpacks, said by a cop to who seemed like the supervisor of the hall. Confused fans who now see some hope, they go INTO the wedding hall and lock it again. We then went to the high Grounds police station

So there we were, having none to go to. DNA denied any responsibility. So did the cops. And to emphasize that point, they beat us up with lathis. Who’s going to return Anuj his laptop, external hard disk and 4 months’ worth of research notes? Who will return the couple from Malaysia their flight tickets, passports and money? What will happen to the iPods and iPhones that went missing? And what of the dozens of passports and ID cards? Frankly, we don’t know.

DNA will have to pay. So will the cops.

We will pursue the case with all we have. But well,False,self,t5_2qh1q,False,,,t3_lwmnd

[Part 1]

Why am I posting this?
-----
I've been in the software industry for many years now. I've interviewed and been interviewed in all kinds of situations

I see a lot of interview advice geared towards the west, there is a lot to interviews that varies across cultures - ranging from demeanor to dress code. I also see job seekers and employers making a few common mistakes, and I feel somewhat alarmed to see some things getting repeated so often that they are becoming almost cultural. So consider yourself warned: I do have an axe to grind.


Who is this for?
-----
You're one of these:

- A fresher (aka: new grad, etc )
- A mid-level lateral hire. Someone with &lt;=10 years of work experience looking to move.

Or

- An engineer interviewing people to join your mid-size (&lt; 1000 employees) company
- An engineer looking to hire for your startup

Or you are just curious about the process in general.

Prerequisites / Related work:
-----
There is a ton of information about interviews already available on the Internet. I don't want to repeat this corpus of information. I would recommend that you go through a few resources that I feel are important. Many of them seem to be pitched for a specific company

- Process: http://www.kchodorow.com/blog/2013/02/28/guide-to-tech-interviews/
- Content: http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/03/get-that-job-at-google.html
- Questions and approaches: http://www.piexposed.com/
- Useful websites: Glassdoor

Who is this NOT for?
-----
- You hate the software field but like the money
- You cheated through your basic C programming course. Please go shoot yourself. You're part of the reason there's a negative stereotype about Indian developers.
- You work in roles other than design/development/QA. I know nothing outside these fields so please don't take my advice.
- You're a prodigy without a formal tech education - I honestly don't think the university degree matters

So

Candidates:
-------
Here's the first thing you need to know: The concept of the 'interview process' is a myth. There's no single interview process. No one seems to have any clue why certain candidates get hired and some candidates get rejected. As an interviewer

It's your job as a candidate to maximize your chances of being ranked 'good'. There are no shortcuts to achieve this: you need to be a good developer. There's no cheatsheet or magic list of things you need to know. 

**Fresh graduates:**


You are in college and it's time to look for a job. Here are a few things I would strongly recommend:
First off, and considering how random hiring decisions are, the only thing you can do is to honestly and sincerely work on being a good developer.

- Don't be a rat in the rat race. This industry can be very enjoyable if you take time to cultivate and follow up on your interests. You may have to sneak time to do what you like to do while you do something else to earn money - sadly

- Be curious! Why do you fall for the general rhetoric that liking your subjects is uncool? I find even the most minor things to be endlessly fascinating. (Seriously
- Learn to use the Internet as a source of information
- Work on stuff in your spare time. For some reason

- Whatever field you are in, instead of one giant kick-ass project in Scala. Hardware girl? Work on embedded systems alongside your Verilog behemoth. Systems ninja? Learn a bunch of simulations and topologies, or learn to build an Android app. Get your hands dirty with different things! I hate seeing a girl from college who is an expert in MATLAB but can't explain why it's not used everywhere. You're wasting your potential. Your professors will tell you to be an expert in one thing, but you need to understand the ecosystem you exist in before you can specialize.
- Join student organizations that are involved in tech. Your college probably has an IEEE or ACM student branch. Perhaps there's an LUG nearby. Maybe a few friends are building an app for your college fest. Whatever
- Do an internship if you can. The benefits should be obvious
- Keep an updated resume at all times after your 2nd year. Get your resume reviewed by many people. Check if members of your faculty have industry experience. Hit up your seniors who are in companies. Maintain a personal website perhaps.
- Don't have a ""dream job"" or a ""dream company"". There's no such thing. You may think that your life will be incredible if you join $company but chances are it'll be just as good in many
- Don't plan to be a job hopper. Loyalty may be underrated
- Don't be cynical. Your peers will tell you that ""No good work happens in India"" or ""IT jobs here are just people who cut paste code"" or ""It's just a software coolie position"". I can go on for hours with detailed examples about why they are wrong
- DO NOT LIE AND CHEAT your way through college.
- Try to cultivate non-technical interests as well. You're going to be cooped up in a cubicle farm for months on end with a bunch of people. Would you rather be with a group filled with bookish nerds? Or in a group that has smart people who happen to play mridangam/take photographs/go dancing?
- Learn to talk to strangers about yourself and technology. The hardest thing to do in an interview is to walk in and be ""on"" immediately. Especially in India
- Seek out smart people among your peers or teachers/juniors/seniors/relatives and cultivate relationships with them. You know all the sports guys hang out with other sports guys
- Learn to function in a team. What does this mean at your level? Basically
   * Learn to make time commitments and keep them
   * Learn to listen to your team mates and help them out 
   * Learn to ask for help where appropriate 
   * Learn to describe your work clearly and concisely
   * Learn to be impersonal: There is a world of difference between ""Why didn't you do it this way?"" vs ""Would this way also work?""
   * Learn to manage your time well (really
   * Learn to deal with people who don't do any of the things above (this can be the absolute hardest. It was for me.)
   * Learn to take feedback (solicited or unsolicited) without getting riled up about it.
   * Learn to separate your 'professional' connection from your 'personal' connection. If you end up doing all your projects with the girl/guy you're dating or your roommate

  You probably notice that ""team work"" basically means ""be a good person"". Well, the things on top should help you go a long, long way. Work in teams in college where possible, and don't stick to the same team forever.

I have stopped posting here and having seen the quality of posts and redditors who frequent the subreddit, I thought I might make a plea to all you people on r/india who think it's fun to ruin this forum with your shit..

You wax eloquent about the complex sentence structure in Narcopolis

You had opinions on every Indian story - Arundhathi Roy's, the stories in your Gulmohar reader, Tinkle, etc. At some point, probably in the early angst-ridden teenage years, you put pen to paper and let the ink express your feelings. You showed your diary, and later on, to a few friends and family. They read your dark poems, your stick drawing reviews of movies

""But, ""first get off that engineering degree, and do whatever you want. Of course, you also have to get married and all, na? Then you can do this writing-titing. Okay?""

So you hung your towel to dry, staring at the mirror, shirting, panting, tying and dying, and wondering where you lost that zing thing, that once Gold Spot in your life. You wonder if you still have it in you. You ask yourself in the shower what would someone think if they read that one blog post that you recently wrote, you are the hidden Pico Iyer, who has sailed and discovered many beautiful lands of words

Well, at /r/indianwriters are here to precisely talk about these things, and more. When a group of (pretty serious) writers found ourselves without a voice on the Pangea of a writing sub, /r/writing, we decided to form our own little Ceylon, a small tropical writing paradise strictly for writers from india/writers who write about india/heck, anything loosely connected with India and writing (Yes! Editors

We love the mayuric usage of the English language, borrowed and wordnapped from Indian languages, and strung together like a wedding garland. Some of us are serious writers. Some of us are serious amateurs. Some of us are just serious, but love to read! 

We talk about vernacular usage, story arcs, the whole nine Kanchipuram silk yards! We want to invite you budding authoresses and authors, you regal kings and queens of Reynolds, you magnificent Facebook status-smiths, you one line twitterati zing-slingers, you lovers of the English language, talk about writing

**TL;DR**: /r/indianwriters is a new sub for indian writers.

With whatever has happened aside

**Comment score hiding**

This is not going to be implemented. The results of the informal poll set up by our fellow mod /u/rahulthewall is very clearly against it. I also agree to the fact that a discussion should have been had regarding this before implementation and experimentation. Apologies to the community on the slip up.

But surprising fact in the poll was how close it was and how many people actually supported it.

*****

**Banning**

We haven't banned anyone for ages as we haven't seen any major transgressions against the community policy [Available in wiki] by anyone. Wherever there were serial offenders going about their business with complete disregard for the very minimal rule set we have

**We are not banning anyone as of now** Personally I don't believe this works well with the current Reddit love for anonymity. Even in the worst case scenario

*****

**Mod Policy**

Pretty much most of the moderation is in a Laissez-faire attitude over here except on couple of instances where we had to deal with users like /u/lungilungi and /u/wakthoo where we had to use certain amount of discretion in handling the situation [Discretion over and above our rule set] The situation warranted an exceptional measure and I believe we handled it as it was required. 

Apart from these instances

For a more moderated version of a community related to India

*****

**Way ahead**

There is no change in any community policy as of now. We'll try and keep /r/india as free as required from direct moderation. This may change later and we would keep you sufficiently informed and would not pull a fast one. 

*****

**Changes in the mod team**

Contrary to the popular opinion

We would have a mod election shortly. This election is more to understand who is interested in the community's well being rather than who is more popular. So the final discretion of the selection of the new mods will be still with us. There will be a separate thread with the eligibility criteria posted within this week. So watch out for it and do participate.

*****

Having been here since its inception, we can still stand apart and contribute something positive to our country from this community.

Reginald E.H Dyer,000 people including women, children and elderly, went with a group of riflemen and fired on the gathering. He continued firing until ammunition was exhausted. 

The Indian National Congress estimate that about 1500 were injured and almost a 1000 people were killed. That included women and children. It was an outrageous act

**Reactions**

Winston Churchill described it as ""monstrous"" and many British officials openly condemned it.

Sir Rabindranath Tagore gave up his knighthood in protest.

I'm posting this here hoping that you guys will ""get it"" better than anywhere else on reddit. I'm a 32 year-old male, religious and my sibling and I mean the world to them. I'm very liberal, an atheist and very ""individualistic"". I've been living in the US for about a decade, and although my parents think that's what poisoned my mind with ideas of individualism, that's not true - I've always been this way.


All my friends who I grew up with are married (many with children) as of now. My parents think that I'm already three years too late, go to India for a ""vacation"", meet the girl and ""get engaged"", come back to the US, chat/talk to her for a few months ""getting to know each other"", go back to India and get married - which admittedly is not very different from what many of my friends did. However, I cannot bring myself to do this.


I don't have a girlfriend now - so it's not that I'm against arranged marriage BECAUSE I have someone in mind. I just don't find myself at a point in my life to make as huge a commitment as marriage. We've had many arguments in the past, but my point is that marriage is such a big deal that before everything else, I should be ready for it and the readiness should come from within myself. I hope I'm not painting a demonic picture of my parents, because that would be very far from the truth. They are actually very polite and sound helpless (""Look at me, don't you see how much I love you? Don't you see how much I'm suffering because you won't get married? All I want is for you to be happy!"") Sometimes I wish they were rude and trying to force their ideas upon me, because then I could simply tell them to fuck off.


That being said, because I won't be able to forgive myself if, god forbid, something happens to them before I fulfill their wishes. Sometimes I feel differently - this is my life, I and only I should have any say in when or whom I get married to, and while it is sad that my parents don't agree, it's not really my fault. I'm torn and don't know what to do - this may be the biggest dilemma I've ever faced in my life.


Have any of you gone through something similar? Any thoughts or advice? I hope I don't get responses like ""Dude, because unfortunately, it's not that simple and who can understand better if not r/india? :)",,False,self,t5_2qh1q,,http://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/lr0mm/parents_want_me_to_get_married_i_dont_want_to/

I know it's topic that's been beaten and re-beaten to death a hundred times - Delhi is rough city, Delhi men are like that. I'm fine with staring but I get bloody irritated when people invade my space and sense of security, like the many men who have slowed down their cars alongside me and asked me inside while I was walking down the street in South Delhi, or even the more persistent ones who one time offered me money and stalked me down the block for a while, at night. Or the ones who have groped me on the sidewalk in Old Delhi. It's fucking scary, and fucking irritating!
 
Yes, how bad my new website looked, etc. That, or he was hitting on me. What the fuck? 

I also had some genius try to pose as another foreign woman who had come to Mumbai to live and 'befriended' me. I figured out it was a fake when I realized they were ONLY Tweeting me
 
I don't think this is just an issue for foreign women

So, only worse. Even Africans and Asians (or even Northeasterners) have their own sets of problems, many worse/more racially driven than my own.

I was in first year B.Com when it happened. My parents had stayed back in the gulf and I was here in India under the supervision of an extended family. They didn't bother me much so I was under the influence of new found freedom.


Two months had passed, I was smitten by her looks and the way she carried herself. You know how sometimes one female partners up with another female and are always together? Well, the girl she became besht friends with was already a good friend of mine (Girl_B) and I told her how I felt about the new girl.


It is important to also introduce my good friends at the time, which for us, at the time was a very big deal. 


Moving on, Friend_A, Friend_B, Girl_A, Girl_B and Girl_B's sister sit all packed up in our Zen and go see a movie. I think the movie was 'Deewane Hue Pagal'. Things were going kinda okay with Girl_A and we had the whole day planned out. I was standing in queue for the tickets and that's when the first warning came.


A guy from my college who I had never really spoken to much comes up to me and says with a smug smile 'You shouldn't have brought her here'. I ignored him and Friend_A asked him to mind his own business. He whips out his cellphone and walks away. We go watch the movie


It was actually Friend_A and Friend_B who first realized that we were in trouble. I had no idea that something like this could happen and didn't have the slightest clue of what was going on. My initial thoughts were that Friend_A or Friend_B's friends has spotted his car and were waiting for him. I was asked to stay with the girls while they went and talked. 


Three guys each put their arms around both my friends and walked them away from the car in different directions. Me and the girls are still not concerned and are just standing and chatting. Enter Son_of_MLA. Slimey fellow goes straight for Girl_A and politely asks her to leave. Girl_A says something along the lines of 'You have no right to tell me what to do any more'. I am standing there confused looking like an idiot. The girls make for the car and I follow them. Girl_A also seems to be joining us. I still have no idea what is going on. Son_of_MLA seems to be whispering something to Girl_A at this point but she seems pissed. I see Friend_A and Friend_B coming back to the car and signalling us to get inside. Friend_B opens the car and gets into the driver's seat. Girl_B and Girl_B's sister enter the back. I wait for Girl_A to enter before I stuff myself in at the back. But just as she was about to enter, that didn't happen. As if I were trying to break a fight between two kinder-gardeners, I stand between them and remove Son_of_MLA's grip from girl's hand. Bad move.


I was sucker-slapped 5-6 times. My beloved Friends A and B were dragged out. Some guy head-butted me to the ground. While on the floor, but the pride and ego were screaming out profanities. Then a familiar face of some other guy from college shows up. He stuffs me and my friends into our car and keeps repeating that we should leave. I meet eyes with Girl_A to check on her, she's getting into an auto. Thankfully, alone. She tells me that she'll join us later and everyone around us is screaming at us to leave. We comply and drive away. We stop a few kilometres later to do a damage report. That's when my friend told me that Son_of_MLA was in fact, the son of an MLA and Girl_A and him had broken up quite recently.


I wish I could say that it ended there


Part 2


So we drop Girl_B and her sister back at their home. I receive a text from Girl_A stating that she's ok  and is very sorry for what just happened and at this point I choose not to respond because I am still reeling from whatever the fuck just happened. On our drive back to the neighbourhood


Friend_A: Tu ch_tiya hai baap! *You are an idiot!*


Me: Main ch_tiya hun? *What?*


Friend_B: Teku bola tha chup chap gaadi main jaane ko. Kya zaroorat thi beech main padne ki? *We had signalled you to get in the car


Friend_A: Poore college ko pata hogaya hoga ab tak ke humne apni phutwali hai. *Probably


*Silence*


I chose not to speak because those friends also had an advisory role through out those initial few days in India. I was too freaked out to care


At around 6pm I get a call from Friend_B stating that we're being hunted. Apparently, my understanding of India was limited to what I had seen in Bollywood and the experiences/instructions of my cousins. I decide against informing my caretakers and just go with it. We reach the rendezvous point at 8.30pm with The_Cousin.


The ground seemed awfully dark and deserted. After we parked


He looks at Friend_A, ___school main pada, ___se intermediate kara aur ___ colony main rehta aur tere 2 bhai aur 1 behen hai, na?' *You are Friend_A, you are Friend_A_Dad's son and you've studied in these ___schools and college. You also have 1 sister and 2 brothers and you live in ___ colony?'*

Friend_A nods in affirmation.


Then he turn to me and gives a 'Tell us something about you' answer on my behalf and the process repeats with Friend_B.


I guess the aim of telling us information about us to ourselves was his way of trying to intimidate us. It kind of worked. By this point


The_Cousin steps in with the predictable 'Bache hai, Son_of_MLA asks us to apologize which we do in unison and claims that he is letting us go just because of The_Cousin. 


Epilogue:

That entire year we ended up becoming the bitches of The_Cousin. Meaning, he left the country soon and has left our lives.


The incident shot us to fame in our college. Opinion was divided whether we were too stupid and naive or just well connected. We were randomly asked about it for about a week or two


Girl_A stopped coming to college after that incident. I told myself that I didn't want to talk to her because she had lied to me about a few things. In truth

Things you should keep: Chillispray/Pepperspray

1. Guy tried to scare you: Spray chillispray over his eyes.
2. Guy on a bike follows you while you are speaking on the phone: Scream out the numbers on his number plate.
3. Guy following on bike: Take out your phone and take (or atleast pretend to take a picture of him or his number plate)
4. Guy follows you on foot: Take out your chillispray.
5. [VERY IMPORTANT] Be confident. Don't lead them on. Don't ignore the ones that may cause harm. Don't let them think you are weak. Make noise and let someone around know. Better paranoid than dead.

Remember: Some guys will tease you no matter what you wear. Be confident and reach your destination.

Waiting till you are 30 years old to 'get married' and then be with a woman goes against every natural urge a guy has since he hit puberty. Sex until marriage is a crime against nature.

Provide free (or at least very cheap) contraception, pay women equally so they do not feel inferior and dependent, and MOST importantly, make prostitution legal and regulate it!!

- Littering
- Pooping in public restrooms and not flushing

I see a typical barber shop - chairs, or telgu so I'm just communicating with gestures and nods.  I sit down and expect some electric shaver or something, but the old wrinkled Indian man with lots of character just starts in with the scissors - *shingshingshing* rapidly!  Really fast, my hair is flying everywhere and he is doing a great job!  It is amazing and I'm looking out onto the street and taking in all the sights and sounds of the busy city, and am really enjoying this small event.  Then...



Then I get slapped up side the head - and again!  *Whap* *Whap*  *whapwhapwhap*  Bends my neck this way and that - OUCH!!! WTF!!!??? This continues for some time, and while I was not injured, I was very surprised to say the least that I thought I was being abused ;)

1363145558.0,1a706q,The decline and fall of Indian Civilization,karma_hunter,119,37,225,"*At the outset

Socrates, this concept has been lost to humanity and no literal translation exists in English. The essence of ‘Thumos’ can probably be summed up by the saying – “When making a decision, a man is faced with two choices. An easy path and a tough path. The easy path leads to barbarism. The tough to civilization"". And it is this tough road that every society must traverse to reach a peak. Taking the tougher road is an informed decision, for the natural impulse of every man is to take the easy path. He has to consciously take the tougher path, and avoid the easy. However, a man might unknowingly go down the easy path and end up where he did not want to be. Retracing your steps back to the tougher path is often a thankless and sometimes nigh on impossible task. Most men do not make it. India too, is at this cross roads today. And we might not make it.

It is indeed, but to merely show how far we have strayed from it.  Make no such mistake. For the Vedas, the ultimate repository of Indian philosophy, were written long, long before Socrates’ ancestors even took up the plough and decided to grow the weeds they had observed in the wild and gave them nourishment. We had reached unimaginable highs and fallen from those highs, long before Socrates even had his first coherent thought. All Socrates did then, was re-discover what we had already known. We were superior in all respects. And it is in this very attitude, past, gave a concrete answer to this question. If they gave an answer at all.

The most common response to my question was anger and a rebuke for asking too many questions. How then are we superior? IF we are superior at all?  Let us look around the world today and ask ourselves, and objects that I use in my daily life on a day-to-day basis emerged from purely indigenous sources?” I asked myself this question many times, over and over again.  The conclusion was the same everytime. None. To further clarify this point, let us look at the last invention of consequence which had a purely Oriental origin. Gunpowder. And this too was taken up and advanced by the West. If the Chinese invented Gunpowder, it was the West that developed the cannons that used them. Indeed, there is nothing that we can call truly our own except the past.  And as all of us have seen, we revere the past. It is drummed into us in our schools, in our families and at the dinner table. Indian culture always was and is

It is important to realize that I am not saying that India or Indian culture is inferior or all that we developed as a civilization is a fabrication. It is not a fabrication. We were indeed a highly advanced civilization

How did we then fall so low? How did we, colonialism, British rule and all that. But the problem lies much deeper than that.

Every empire is built on one strength. One strength that sets it apart from the neighbours and allows it to grow while others around it stagnate. The Roman empire was built on the discipline of its Legions. Most armies of that time were little more than unruly mobs and this proverbial discipline of the Roman Legion made it a formidable attacking force.  The British Empire was built on the strength of the trade links between Britain, to sitcoms, our thought processes and ideas, to even what we eat and wear, it is the cultural power of the USA in full show. Every empire in history has had its one strength. And India too had a cultural empire similar to what the USA has today. A thousand years ago, students flocked from all over the world to study at Nalanda and Taxila. Just as they flock to the USA today. Great ideas were born in this crucible of free thought. Religions, philosophies and sciences were established by enlightened souls. Just as they are being established in the USA today. However, as we all know

The strength of Indian civilization was always in its openness to new ideas. And a willingness to put in the hard work to further those ideas. Today however, but also in every detail of our lives. A teacher in India does not like it if his student questions him. For in that question, lies the seed of a new idea. And in that seed, lies the implication that the teacher may be wrong. And that is why we Indians do not like someone who asks too many questions, as I found out to my cost when I questioned India’s supposed cultural superiority.

A far more dangerous symptom however, nay, as a civilization have become addicted to shortcuts. And hence we have fallen. Everything in India can be resolved by a shortcut. If you stand in a queue, there is always a tout who will be happy to help you jump the line for a fee. Instead of paying your taxes, it is far easier to just hide your income under your bed. Why wait for the light to change from red to green when there is no one crossing your path? Why be orderly when you can be disorderly and get away with it? Why work hard when you can steal from someone? Why be polite when you do not have to be? Why throw the garbage into the dustbin when someone is there to collect it from any spot in the city? I could go on and on. Everything in India has a shortcut. And this culture of taking shortcuts has struck root in the very mindset of our society. Every single thing is now a shortcut. Jugaad. Why take the tougher road to civilization? Why apply our minds when someone else can do it? It is easier to run away to the West than stay back and make this country worth living in. Why perform original research in India where you have to build your own apparatus, when you can just hop across the pond and perform that same research in the West, where that same apparatus can be bought off the shelf? Why? Why indeed? Because, it is a historical inevitability.

Historical inevitability? Yes, but only in vestiges. And as we have already seen, it is being gradually eroded. It is historical inevitability. The point is further clarified by a study of entropy. Entropy, in layman’s terms, is a measure of the disorderliness in a system. In any spontaneous process, Entropy always increases. So if we consider human history to be a spontaneous process, interspersed by periods where Man has consciously tried to improve himself, taking the tougher road is an informed decision, it begins to decline. Every civilization has declined and so shall we.

And so we have declined. Our fall has only begun. And we shall keep falling, which laid the foundation for the current dominance of Western civilization. Kemal Mustafa Ataturk’s radical measures of Westernization and his suppression of anything connected with the decadence of the Ottoman empire, gave rise to Modern Turkey. A nation that is a beacon of hope for the Muslim world. What kind of shock treatment can reverse the tide of India’s decline? I do not know. But the least we can do, is acknowledge that we have a problem. And when you see the problem and the scale of it, it will give you the shock treatment.

**TL;DR - We are in decline because our culture has lost its ability to question and innovate. We also prefer shortcuts. It is a historical inevitability and there is nothing we can do about it.**
