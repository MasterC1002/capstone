Thank you guys so much for your stories. In case you didn't notice (many have not), it's always very straight, to the point, and sometimes a bit awkward with them expressing themselves.


I am very glad I made this thread if for no other reason for men to be able to express themselves and what they are going through and to open people's eyes to this phenomena. I have a decent handful female friends who think it's a turn off if a *male* shares his emotions and I think that that gender expectation has got to change.

Date night rolls around, so I asked her since I only had a $5 if she wouldn't mind paying the other $3. She agreed and did so by card.

When asked what to drink, she orders the most expensive bottle of white, saying ""I've never tried this one before! and giggling."" I'm cool, we're splitting the cheque. No issue. She orders the most expensive starter, followed by the most expensive main (as well as a glass of red to compliment the meat) and finally a dessert. 

The total comes to around $180. My food and half of the bottle of wine came to around $50, more than half but that's all fine with me. She doesn't look at it or anything. After about 10 minutes of her obviously avoiding the subject, she asks, ""uh, I think the bill was a bit more than 100."" I smirk, tell her that we've agreed to split it, at which point she asks me if I was ""actually serious"" before saying ""I don't have my purse on me anyway."" I see what's happened. I smile at her, and say that I've left my card in my coat so I'll go over to get it. I pick up the $100 from the table. I walk over, walk the other way to avoid her seeing me from the window

We have a pretty good sex life.  She wants it almost as much as I do and usually our foreplay includes toys

Full disclosure I had always known my gf kept in touch with some of her ex boyfriends that she was still on good terms with and had been friends before and after their relationship ended.  This one guy Tom I knew after hanging out with him once or twice when we were all drinking together

One day recently though I saw on her facebook page that she had been tagged in a photo with tom from another mutual friend in some photo from when they were all together + friends from two years ago.  I was reading through the comments when the mutual friend said something along the lines of ""omg u guys were so cute together!!1 :)"".    Well Tom replied to it with ""lol haha well at least [my gf's name] still has something to remember me by ;)"".  I thought of course at the time they were just talking about the photo, all of them, which weirded me out.  I asked my GF what Tom had been talking about, about what he meant with the something to remember me by comment.  She didn't know what I was talking about at first but then told me about the dildo.  Apparently, when she and Tom were still together, they had the idea together to make a mold of his cock using one of those dildo molding kits so that my GF would have something to use when she went to study abroad for the semester.  And the dildo was the very same favorite one that we used during our foreplay.  I'll admit i freaked the fuck out at the time and told her to get rid of it that instant, that I can't believe she wanted to be fucked using Tom's cock while we were having sex.  She yelled back at me telling me that I was acting like a jealous child and that it was just a dildo in her collection and that i was trying to control her.  So yeah that convo didn't end well and we kinda cooled off a bit separately.

We had sex since the argument a few days later though we hadn't used the toy.  When she was in the bathroom I looked at it again though and started feeling mad all over again.  I never really thought about it before but it is bigger and thicker than I am so to speak which of course brought some feelings of inadequacy.  I talked to her about it again bringing it up and told her how I felt about it

Still, or Tom?  I know she said she thinks of me and what can I say, that she's lying?  Ugh.  So what should I do cause I don't want to start resenting her for it but I don't want to start another fight.

**welp If it makes you people happy** *I just got lectured for 5 minutes* about how important it is to own a plunger and why I should buy one as soon as he leaves. I asked him if it was bad. He just stared at me and said this is the worst thing he's had all day. But he looked away when he said he's seen worse :(

I really wish I didn't. Turns out, he had a moment of clarity that he really did want to be with me and that sex with others wasn't that great (so apparently you need to have sex three times with the same girl before you can reach that conclusion -_-).

So after listening to this

She's pregnant. After hearing that

I was shaking with fury. I was so angry with him I didn't even cry. I'm still shaking right now as I type this. I pretty much told him off and then told him that I wish him the best of luck with his new family.

1359443790.0,17hhan,The answers to most of the questions on this subreddit.,,819,131,88,"This is one of my favorite subreddits

1) I like a guy

A) Fucking tell him.  Don't beat around the bush either.  We guys suck at taking hints and we can rationalize almost anything to mean the exact opposite of what you say.  If you like a guy

""Date"" is important here.  Make sure he knows it is a date.  

When in doubt

Quasi-edit 1: 

Do guys like girls who make the first move/ask the guy out?

Yes.  It takes the pressure off of us

In my experience

2) How do I flirt with guys?

A) Again
(i) Talk to him

(ii) Laugh at his stupid jokes.  (We are guys

(iii) Initiate physical contact.  A touch on the arm goes A LONG way.  

(iv) Pretty much done.  Show interest through positive communication

(v) Be blatant.  Guys miss a lot of hints.  Say what you mean

3) Do any guys like X type of girl?

A) Yes... there is always somebody who like a certain type of girl... Don't worry about it.

4) Being friends with guys?

A) Most guys are not initially looking to be friends with a girl.  Keep your intentions clear without being insulting.  If you feel friendzoned, don't lead him on.  Be friends with him, it is possible.

5)  I like this girl. Now what?

A) Ask her out...

5) But what if

A)No

5)How?

A) Hey

That was bad

6) Friendzone!

A)Go away


TL;DR
Relationships are not that hard... Guys are generally easy.  We don't pick up on hints well.  Be obvious.

Girls are also easy

This is not rocket science.  Be kind


EDIT: Respect yourself as much, don't be afraid to walk away.  


EDIT 2: Billy Joel was nice enough to remind me that I missed a few things.  

Blow jobs? 

Yes.  We like those.  How do you do them? Put your mouth on my penis.  DON'T BITE DOWN!!!! 

As much as I may say that you are the most important thing in my life, be creative.  

Do I facebook stalk my exes? 

Abso-fucking-lutely.  Why? Because we are masochistic assholes, but realistically a couple of times per day at first with an exponential decrease as time goes by.  


Because it feels relevant: 

Getting over a girl (or guy, realize why you are so fucking awesome and why she (or he) is missing the fuck out.  Additionally, spend time with friends.  Be careful with the alcohol, but realize the healing properties of straight whiskey or tequila when used responsibly.  Keep busy, pick up a hobby, and love yourself (This does not mean masturbate, but yeah

I'm afraid of their strength the most. Any man would be able to take me and do as he wishes. I'm a very

If I am alone in a room with a man

I'm afraid of men's sexual drives. Most pedophiles are men. Most rapists are men. I'm afraid of these facts. Most men that get raped

I hear countless stories from females about their rape experiences, molested by their brother, raped by their father, etc. 

I'm afraid of how men treat women. Sexism on reddit is very obvious, and I fucking hate seeing things like that on the front page, because it just confirms my fears/sexism. 

There are so many creep posts made on reddit about men jacking off into their sisters shoes and creepy perverted stuff like that. I'm afraid of this.

Er... what? I love my girlfriend; I've been with her for almost 6 years, no one can be perfect; I'm certainly not.

But if I ever came out in one of these topics and said 'actually, y'know, and I'm sure they can handle the fact that not everybody will find them perfect; they don't need to be shielded from this, it's natural.

And what's even worse, when I used to sleep around I very much did notice the details on my partners body. Some times I'd be really attracted to them, sometimes I wouldn't; it was never the end of the world.

1371824343.0,1gsmm9,I (25M) have a friend (28M) whose virginity is fermenting into super creepy weirdo stuff.,,597,135,454,"For whatever reason my 28 year old friend is still a virgin.  His creepy levels have been increasing over the years.  

It started with simple stuff

He plays a ""fake drunk"" sometimes.  We run out of alcohol at 11pm and he gets more and more drunk by early morning.

A girl talked to him for 5 minutes

He spends countless hours of early morning on facebook

He does have some type of anxiety problem nowadays.  I don't know if lack of sex caused it.  Every conversation is a way for him to reassure me and others he isn't gay...last night the question was if you made 1million per year,000 on fucking 100 of the hottest supermodels.

So do i hire a prostitute?  I'm slowly watching him get worse and worse.  He is a decade away from either pedophile or rapist or super isolated creepy.  


edit:  Just to clarify:


1.  this isn't highschool level mindset

2.  He is averagely attractive (according to my GF and other girls who know him)

3.  He is very social

4.  He has had opportunities to sleep with women, she looks 14 maybe""  If we went the prostitute route, it would have to be elaborate....like wanna-be-actress meets hooker kinda of girl.  She would literally have to play him through the first couple days if not weeks.

5.  Gay?  Very interesting but as a close friend I highly doubt it.  Back in high school we used his computer without his permission.  Tons of porn


More odd examples:

We both met this girl (my now current girlfriend) at a party, but still messaged her at 3am to obtain info. on her older sister.

Group of us went to the beach.  One of our female friends put her luggage in a bedroom (sleeping space was tight) but we figured all the girls in 2 rooms, long after female was in bed and only a few of us were awake smoking cigs outside.  He made comments like ""Whats her problem, where am I suppose to sleep tonight?""  Claiming the couch or any other surface was too problematic for his back, insinuating the only acceptable sleeping quarters we in bed with female. 

We went to a college party where he knew everyone.  Since there we no female strangers he just paced the living room for hours waiting for it to be over.  Claiming all the girls we his friends (he had met them all already) and the guys he sees all the time.  This was a bangin like 50 person party during NFL playoffs.  We had food and plenty of beer/pot.  He didn't indulge in any of it.  He literally paced a 15 foot line for hours.  


Edit 2:  My friend is a creep.  My friend is also a virgin.

Here's the problem: the cuteness stops below the neck. First off, moles, scars, not curvy, big flappy stomach et cetera. But my main problem is with the naughty bits. I have more roast beef than a deli- and before you link to the Great Wall of Vagina, none of those women come close to the amount of junk I have going on.

Now I don't know what to do about dating or sex at all. I don't let the way I look affect my behavior or display my lack of confidence. But I feel like I'm false advertisement, rather than the controversial tab. Should I wait to get to know someone before sex, instead of sticking to casual hookups, or would that be unfair (because they are 'locked in' to the situation)? Is there a way to spin this so I don't gross guys out? Do I have any hope of regular dating or a relationship, even if nonmonogamous? I won't have money for surgeries for a few years at least.

I've always just been okay being alone. I don't feel lonely, I'm a physical guy and I like to touch, or even just cuddle. I like to devote myself pretty hard to a woman I care about, and I'm very selfless and always thinking of their needs first.

The thing is, nor do I really think that when I'm in another serious relationship that a girl will care that I haven't been in a lot of pointless endeavours. I almost think I'm holding out for the perfect girl at times, which I realize if I did I'd be alone for eternity. I know what I want in a relationship, I've had a lot of time to get to know myself, and what I want, and need from someone else.

I have been burned a couple times on long term relationships. So I am pretty sure that my opinion is biased. I am also a pretty strong introvert. But basically, what I would say, is a solid 7. I'm not rich, but I have a nice car and can afford some toys for myself. And my life stays pretty solid at a 7. Sometimes I get behind on bills or other responsibilities, and it's a 6. Other times I get to see new parts of the world and it's an 8. I firmly believe that if I was in a relationship, my life could be a 9, or even a 10, like cheating

Right now, there will be aspects of my life that are not directly my fault that I can't fix. Whether it be a fight between us, or a problem in her life that I am obligated to help with. Now, make no mistake, I understand my role in a relationship and would not hesitate to do everything in my power to help my significant other. But that's still two lives worth of life problems that I am now involved in, instead of just one. 

I am not trying to attack women and say that they ruin everything, so the capabilities of a female to hurt me are all I care about. And I'll be honest, the many failed relationships that I have seen have been the fault of the woman (adultery). But not all women are the same, so I try to not judge the gender based on the actions of a dozen. But it doesn't help convince me that I'm wrong (which I may be). 

Relationships just seem like such a big risk. I share the most intimate details of my life, my free time, my happy moments and my sad moments. And there is still a chance that she'll leave me after I retire and she can take half of my pension (seen it). There's no way to guarantee that the woman I pick to spend my life with will stay faithful and loving for 50 years. I feel it's just human nature. A portion of the population (a good portion it seems) are unreliable. Is sharing every aspect of my life, and connecting myself to this person forever through children, really worth the risk? 

My hormones say yes. The desire to date and make babies is strong. When I see a happy relationship, and I imagine a relationship. But in every case, I think about what I've said above, and I return to my life of 7 level happiness.

I just can't get past the odds of it all. I am not a gambling man. When I go to Vegas, and much higher in dating relationships. And I feel like ""winning"" doesn't return a massive payout like a slot machine, it returns a life better (but not drastically better) than the life I had. In other words, I wouldn't bet half of my income and belongings for the next however many years for a return of ""you get to keep those things, and sometimes be happier than you are now"" at a slot machine.

His father elected many years ago to not be a part of his life so approaching him for help or advice isn’t an option.  A coworker told me about this large forum so I thought I’d give it a try. Read all the rules first

It’s been a rough couple of months for him lately. Just generally depressed

But it’s been bothering me more and more. So Saturday evening I wrote him a handwritten note and left it on the kitchen counter for him to find the next morning. I just expressed that no matter what was going on he could talk to me. No judgments

He kept to his bedroom all day on Sunday. Late last night he finally came out of his room

How can I help him gain self-esteem? Is this something a Mom can do for a young man? The same coworker that suggested this forum gave me the advice of finding him a male personal trainer to help him with his diet and putting on muscle. Is this a good idea or is he a too young for this approach?  He eats A LOT

From a mother prospective I know that he’ll grow into his height. I’m not at all concerned with him getting a girlfriend

So I guess to end this long ramble my main two questions are this. What else can I be doing to improve his self-esteem? Is he too young for a personal trainer or does that put TOO MUCH emphasis on appearances? 

Any advice from personal experiences would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

I have spent my whole life thinking I was unattractive. The teen girl icons of my time were Brooke Shields and other models like her (google her- as a teen she was around six foot

So fast forward a couple of decades. My marriage is over (it was an abusive marriage but I didn't have the confidence to leave for a very long time- my insecurities about my looks playing a large part in how long I stayed) my kids are grown and no guy has given me a glance for about 25 years. So I am thinking I am going to be alone for the rest of my life. 

Then I find Askmen

So I have changed the way I dress and present myself. Gone are the loose clothes designed to hide my thighs and hips and boobs. Today I went out in my tight black bootcut jeans and clingy blouse with my long blonde hair curling in loose waves and a light spray of a nice perfume to finish.To be honest the jeans were a bit outside my comfort zone- I am not used to wearing tight clothes that cling to my thighs and ass- I felt a bit naked but thought what the hell I'll wear them and see what happens

I had to pick up something for my car, within minutes all four guys had come over to offer assistance. Suddenly I am no longer invisible! And then outside a different shop some random guy spontaneously started a conversation with me and was trying to find out more about me. Today was a really good day!! All is not lost- I might now be a mature lady but maybe I will find another man to keep me company! 

 The things I have just found out about how to present myself to attract a guy must be so obvious to you guys (and probably a lot of women)- but I honestly didn't know until recently that many of you liked thick thighs and a decent ass (mostly thanks to the media and fashion industry who are clearly not run by straight guys.) Thanks a million guys!!

Once I got to college this year, a month long FWB situation, and a few hook ups here or there.

Ultimately, and I feel like the dynamic between men and girls is so asymmetrical that my needs wouldn't be really met. Since my sex drive has kind of fell, I don't really see the point of pursuing girls at all.

He's been able to do the same before

Then when I said, bought himself some time, and said, ""you weren't as horny as usual yesterday?"" 

*I have a feeling he was going to say that I was more hostile than usual

As of this morning, hello period. It's **two weeks early**.

To put in perspective, who was a quiet nerdy guy. When she and I met we always talked a lot about relationships and men, and so I came to hear a lot about Thomas. And because he and I worked within the same narrow field and had many of the same interests, my friend often talked to me about what her and Thomas talked about, and I got the impression that she also talked to Thomas about what she and I spoke about. I never met him, though. But from what I heard about him, to me, decent and intelligent guy.. but my friend was somehow always really unhappy with everything. In the end

Fast forward to now: I have been single for 6 months after having ended a long-term relationship

We have no common friends anymore

So my question is: would it be weird to contact Thomas given the circumstances? I would love to just email him, no? Wouldn't it seem desperate? I have no idea ho to approach this situation without seeming desperate of crazy. Maybe I should just forget about it all?

I know I can't be the only one out there.  Every time I've told any of friends they all laugh and joke about it They think it isn't possible for a woman to rape a guy.  I didn't think it was possible either.

This past New Years I got black out drunk.  I woke up to this woman that I would not have consented to had I been sober

I was able to push her head off of me and button my jeans but then she tried mounting me.  She sat on my stomach/chest and squeezed nearly all the air out of me.  It took all the strength I had just to push her off of me and fight her off the rest of the night.

I didn't remember any of this until later on the next day when I noticed my lip had been cut.  Then I remembered her biting my lip hard enough to break the skin and wake my drunk ass up and it all came flooding back.

She apologized to me the next day about my lip but she supposedly doesn't remember raping me

I was pretty upset about this, especially if I am engaged to be married.  And honestly, the fact that he wouldn't be bothered if I slept with another man hurts as well, even with his knowledge/permission. 

When he saw my reaction, he would hands down have a one night stand before our wedding if we were to get married.

He has been married before and he and his ex-wife had this same arrangement, this is typical, normal behavior that happens at bachelor parties all the time.  But is it?

I trust him and know that he would not cheat on me, is wanting to have one last fling at your bachelor party normal behavior?

It seldom comes in the form I might prefer.  What is wanted vs what is needed.

It is a particular thing

Particular here means that most of the language, fora - are geared toward women.  Statistically this is perfectly understandable.

But there is a place where understanding breaks down.  

As an adult man who lived through more than a decade of sexual abuse at the hands of an adoptive father, from personal experience only, YMMV.

- Guilt, the social (and particularly empowerment) implications of having been a child at the time...the guilt and associated shame remains.  

- Vox, attempts to re-enter this part of myself have never been met with anything other than sexual politics or a narrow framework of understanding.  *fucking listen to me - I enjoyed it - why can you not hear what that means to me, how it makes me feel?*  This plea, uttered in many ways and to many well-intentioned friends, lovers, professionals - does not get heard.  I suspect it makes others uncomfortable, so it must be silenced.

- Relationships.  To say my relationships with women are difficult is to vastly understate the matter.  How do I express that I know what it is to be entered, at the wrong time, by the wrong people?

How do I move from frozen, which continue to affect and define my love, needs, sexuality?  Yes, I am damaged goods, but I am unbelievably beautiful, if you dare to look beneath the rough exterior to the...well...rough interior I suppose

- Guys.  I do not understand them.  They bore me, their swaggers and their use of others.  I fucking despise professional sports and must consciously, deliberately refuse to hate the men in groups who use this spectacle as a vehicle for bonding and drunken revelry.  With just this one aspect of 'guydom' being something on the order of that scraped from the bottom of a shoe (IMO), I find myself isolated from the majority of my sex.  In many other ways such people bore me - and most of my closest friends are other men.

These are a few issues I face

What is your problem?  If you are in any way similar and want to share

I would hear from other men about your own story, what remains to be done.

It is interesting that more men preferred to be asked out (16%) than there were women who preferred to do the asking (6%).   That difference suggests that 10% of men may be waiting quite a while for a woman to ask them out on a first date.

This came up when I was setting up a date with a girl I met at a bar. When fixing up a time for the date she mentioned she would have to get a sitter. I just ended right there. This is one of the things  (probably the only thing) that I consider to be an immediate deal breaker. I just won't get involved. I'll cut the whole thing off before any sort of feelings can develop. I don't know any guys who have dated girls with kids

It's not that I don't like kids. I love them. It's that they make everything more difficult. Like going out. Can't do it spurr of the moment. Have to plan ahead so she can get a sitter.

I'm also not sure how much of this is coloured by my work/life balance at the moment. I currently work about 60-70 hours a week and my schedule is pretty unreliable. I often find out that I have to work late or on weekends without any notice. So the idea of having to plan isn't something I can really do at the moment.

I knew Violet was crazy because her two favorite stories to tell at parties were; the time she'd held a sword to a guys throat at a party

Fast forward a year or so and Violet and I are throwing a party.  I like to throw a party at least once a month, and then, somehow, the conversation allowed her to tell the room full of people the story of the time she had repeatedly shoved a sword up my ass.

 The following are common complaints I hear. They don't necessarily represent my views. I think many of them are just lame excuses for guys who can't admit that they're not attractive to women.

* **Women are too choosy**. Lots of women give off the impression that they'll settle for nothing less than Mr. Perfect. Guys learn this by getting repeatedly rejected despite their best efforts at self-improvement

* **Women aren't approachable.** I agree with this one. The average lady I see during my daily routine is staring at her phone screen and/or has headphones in her ears. It's rare that I see a woman who gives off the vibe that she'll be receptive to a rando striking up a conversation with her.

* **Women have a self-entitled attitude.** They want to be our equals yet they want special treatment from us. They want relationships to be a one-way street where they control us.

* **Women want ""jerks""

* **The laws are skewed in favor of women.** Obviously this is true and a good reason to eschew marriage. We have a gyno-judicial system that royally fucks men over.

I've always imagined myself to be this badass guy who went to a stellar university and got a job at a place like Google or something, but it's hard seeing the light at the end of the tunnel at this point.

I'm not giving up on pursuing my goals. The motivation is still there. It's just that I keep asking myself ""Is this the best that I can do?"" and the answer is almost always ""Yes"". My self-esteem has slowly been decreasing over time

My distress is further increased by the vast amount of success stories that float around here. It seems like there's so many people here who simply worked hard and became uber successful. But what about the guys who work hard and don't make the cut? What happens to them? I fear I might end up in the category of failures you never hear about.

He said he was worried about what other people would think -- didn't want them thinking he was cheap or ""didn't love me enough"" to get me a diamond. He said he felt like I was testing him. I've assured him... it's not a test. I just really place very little importance on ONE piece of jewelry. What if a stone falls out? What if it's lost or misplaced?

I'm simply sick of the unequal effort present in dating. I have a slightly more attractive than average face, have my own apartment, and know that I am funny and smart (obviously I don't come off as either in this rant because I'm being a whiny bitch). I dress pretty well, I'm not a ""nice guy"" TM either. 

As far as dating, me that needs to make the plans, me that needs to carry the conversation. When it comes to paying the best case scenario is that we split but most of the time, I'm paying. I'm the one that needs to ask her out on the second date, I'm the one that needs to make the move for the first kiss, I'm the one that needs to escalate physically. I'm the one who needs to initiate sex and her pleasure supersedes mine. Shit is just exhausting. I'm just a dude that's looking to find a relationship or get laid and it seems to not be worth it. 

The advice is always, work on yourself, etc. and then the women will come. I feel like I am already in good shape, have good hobbies, and am interesting and a good conversationalist but the effort to get women is just simply frustrating. A girl less attractive than me, less smart, less funny, can find sex or find a relationship with so much less effort that it's just disheartening. 

I like to think of myself as pretty progressive and egalitarian but I can definitely feel the disillusion seeping in and I can see how MRAs are formed (no I'm not an MRA).

A road trip from Chicago to central Texas was planned.  It wouldn't be all of us, but it would be the ones who cared.  Geoff, Andrew and I would drive down to St Louis, and just ride I-57 to 55 to New Orleans where we met our buddy Dustin.  Along the way another bro joined in

And it was exactly what you would expect.  A van full of 6 dudes.  Jerky, farts,  weed, Simpsons, Seinfeld, Community and Happy Endings.  3 tablets, 5 laptops, headphones, between the bars and the groddy strip club we accidentally wandered into

But Saturday.  Saturday was just... * divine*.  We woke up at 11

7 hours, I found myself on some stoop with some radiant woman reciting her poetry to me, telling me about her HBO job.  3 hours after that I was asleep on a chair after attempting to stay awake for pancakes and coffee.  I can barely remember her name already, and same goes for the women who accompanied us.  I don't care (ok I do).  it was an amazing experience.  After two nights in New Orleans I had 4 hours sleep and I couldn't be happier.  Oh there were other fun experiences, the *Friday Night Lights* stadium, depressing trips to a McDonalds that experimented with Dadaism design, or sneaking on the field at University of Texas

Were now in Austin, but the dynamic is going to change again.  Next time I see him will be years and years from now, and we will be different people.  We barely recognized each other.  I can feel it with the others too.  Our relationships are flowing and changing, and the people I was closest to 5 years ago are not the same I am closest with now.  And that's ok.  But for now we're going to do what we used to do.

We're different people now.  It's clearly not high school anymore.  Husbands, drunker or weirder.  Some of us love baseball and others fell in love to youthful women who lightened them up.  But I can't shake it.  I am happy.  Things are changing, and I am growing, and so are they.  Things are weird and things are intense and serious and scary and *weird*.  

I don't know what happened.  It ends soon.  I can't wait.  I am so tired, and I just feel gross.  But I am fucking *happy*.  And I am happy to share.

He has been living as a bachelor with roommates for at least 6 years but now we are living together but it seems as if he still thinks of himself as living as a bachelor. This is not a deal breaker per-say but just something very frustrating for me to deal with. I am not a neat freak but I do keep my house and myself clean and all that I am asking from him is to take better care of himself. Is that wrong of me to try and ""change"" him in this fashion?

I asked my BF to bath more frequently since he only does it about once every 9 days and he got mad. He showered but he was still upset. Was I wrong?

So maybe one of you guys here can explain this mentality better than he can. Or maybe he's just a scumbag boyfriend who makes too many demands. I would really appreciate you guys weighing in and it would really help me to understand this about men. 

Thanks!!!

**Update**: Holy crap! I go to work and I come home to this silly question being top post in /r/AskMen! 

I really appreciate all of the comments

Now I'm more embarrassed that I told a whole bunch of strangers over the internet that my boyfriend and I share poop-details. Some of you were pretty grossed out by that... wells

Those of you who feel like my boyfriend is probably sexist. I can honestly say that I have never gotten that impression from being with him for the last 3 years--and this was the only occasion to ever have set me off. In this case, right? 

Anyway, advice, and comments! 


-----------------------------------------


**Another Update (I think you guys will like this one)**:

When my boyfriend got home last night

Honestly, even though he still finds it difficult to get used to a visual of bloody vagainas. We talked about it some more and we decided a on a middle ground--I'll talk to him about my periods, but I just won't go into as much visual detail as I tend to do (I have the tendency to ""show off"" when it comes to gross things) because we do want to keep our sex life alive and well. 

So yay for communication. I guess this is why we've been together for 3 years in a virtually perfect relationship.

Anyway, But she has this childhood friend... She swears up and down that she would never cheat on me, her family was broken up by her mother cheating on her father, but he and she are *close*.

He knows things about her I dont,yea i know), I think mainly because she knows I dont like him, when he in our apartment and im in another room the whisper to each other, his mom likes my girlfriend, when it time for him to leave its a 20 min 'goodbye session' rather than a 'see you later' and heres the kicker, on the last vist he brought a gun with him just in case I attacked him...


It all sounds pretty sketchy, Ive been cheated on before, and if anything I feel like she having an emotional affair with him. Im inclined to turst her because she despises cheating and I love her. Some advice would be much appreciated.

**UPDATE**

reading your replies really made me think I'm a royal idiot

First of all the gun situation: This is the United States, but to me that sounded like he was using his mother as a scapegoat. Perhaps I'm blowing this out of proportion.

For him to feel threatened i have no idea. I don't think Ive ever said anything more than i absolutely had to greeting, etc. I'm 5' 11"" almost 300 pounds, I played football as a linemen and practiced amateur boxing, and still lift regularly, so i guess I may be intimidating, to him who is slightly taller than me and very thin, but I never show dominance. I don't own any guns myself but i do have a large knife collection.

Im not abusive at all. She can do what ever she wants when ever she wants, but im not here to dictate it. Its just this is a bit strange and odd behavior I think.


I talked to her about it briefly to day and i suppose i will again later tonight. She was upset. Very upset. she defended all of her behavior as such; *the long walks together* they both enjoy nature, *the texting* apparently doesn't happen as often as i think, *the discussing personal things with him and not me* she says hes been through similar situations and can relate better than i can.

I told she can keep him as a friend but some of this behavior frankly makes me jealous and has to stop and that i feel like its an emotional affair, all i know right now that loneliness and the worrying what she maybe think hurts like hell...


**UPDATE 2**


Things got really fucking rocky after she got home. She came home locked herself in the bed room for 2 hour and didn't talk to me. After that she came to talk still tears in her eyes saying that there is nothing romantic going on between them but she does get emotional satisfaction from it. It was never her intention of me feeling hurt and feeling as if she is getting something from another man. She agrees  that from another point of view other than her own her action seemed questionable and she doesn't resent me for questioning them. She then explains that she is ready to end all with him in order to keep me. At this point I feel like shit.


The gun thing... I blew that *WAY* out of proportion, so take everything said with a grain of salt. I really make my girlfriend out to be the villain in this post, and she isn't. She one of the sweetest nicest women Ive meet, that's one of the reasons i love her.

While he is very sweet and I enjoy hanging out with him he has zero social skills. He has never had a girlfriend and has a tendency to hit on every female that talks to him. Recently I introduced him to a friend of mine. I made it clear before hand that she had just gotten out of a relationship and it would be inappropriate for him to approach her as anything other than a friend and I would appreciate him not doing so. We all three went to lunch and played board games at a local game store and got along really well. 

Since then (about 4 months ago) he has taken to bothering her a lot. He texts her about four or five times a week and will blow up her phone with messages if she answers. He sits very close to her when he sees her in public (mostly at that same gaming store but he's gone up to the resteraunt she works at a few times). She doesn't feel threatened by him but is hesitant to tell him off because he is so nice and can be overly sensitive.

He doesn't realize it but it comes across really creepy. I'm one of the few female friends he has that is close enough to him to point this out. But he can be so sensitive I'm just not sure how to approach it without hurting his feelings. Is there any nice way to tell him how others view this behavior?

I just started dating a guy who'd previously been my study partner and who generally was in my circle of college friends. Foreplay and oral are out of this world, instead he goes on to make me cum with fingers and hands, so kudos for him. 

I've read the /r/sex FAQ on this very subject, since he is a bit bigger than average. I also want to suggest that he masturbates with a condom on so that he gets used to it. In the absolute worst case, I'm on birth control so I'm also willing to work towards going no condom + birth control + pulling out. 

The big obstacle is how to bring this up. He definitely seems NOT to want to talk about it, and when I come, cuddles me and kinda ignores the fact that we were preparing to have penetrative sex.

[Guest: What’s wrong with Seattle’s dating scene](http://seattletimes.com/html/opinion/2021142903_daniellecampoamoropedxml.html)

&gt; I quickly learned that Seattle men are far different from any other I’ve encountered: shy, our men’s apprehensive tendencies leave them incapable of finding either the open lane or the open bar stool.

&gt; However, truck-driving men of my hometown are born with confidence in their veins and courage in their one-liners.

&gt; It’s true not every man from the last frontier can be described as such.

We have been together for about 5 years but recently she just got a new job and met a lot of new friends that she goes out with at least once a week. When she goes out it is usually to meetup with these friends at a restaurant and then they go do whatever. They usually end up at someones house drinking or going to bars etc to drink and then she ends up getting a ride home from one of them very late at night.

Here is my problem. She does this every weekend now and at least half of the group is guys. I am always freely available to hang out when she is and I never get invited to hang out or meet these people. In fact she doesn't want me to meet them because she says that they wont like me and that they talk shit about people like me ""long haired metal head"" and she doesn't want me to end up getting in a fight with them. I asked her why she would even hang out with those types of people then and she says because ""they make me happy and I enjoy their company"" etc. I have called her out asking if she is embarrassed of me which she says no but who really knows. All I know is that if I meet new friends or if I have existing friends that she is more than welcome to hang out. In fact I would want her to meet my friends. I am just a bit upset that she is leaving every weekend

Also I am not worried about her cheating. I know she wouldn't do that so that is the farthest from my worries.

She's kind of the always has to have all eyes on her girl. She likes attention no matter what she says to deny it. She's a flirt. But she's also beautiful

Just a little backstory. Before I legitimately started to date her we had this kind of thing going on where we were basically together, the usual when in a new relationship. Then she was at some party and met a guy. I was entirely unaware of this and still thought we were together. She dropped the bomb that she was in a relationship with him and that we were through. She was very sympathetic and felt really bad, but I played it off as no big deal. We still talked for a few months here and there. Then after a little while we started to fall for each other again and finally were in a relationship. I gave her a second chance after cheating on me the first time.

Now to main point. I have had lots of suspicions about her cheating on me for about three months now. She always talks about her exes and other guys she's been with. For some reason she feels the need to tell me all about her past relationships and what kind of you know, one of exes is LIVING with her. He was in trouble with the police and needed a place to stay. She still lives with her mom, wether that means anything or not. Now, tonight I was talking to her about seeing her tomorrow night and she was saying how it would be much better to do it earlier in the day. I'm alright with this normally until I asked why and she changed the subject. Eventually I got her to speak and she said that it was too late and that I never can just say okay I always have to argue. I was talking about meeting her at 8PM then having her home whenever she wanted. We have done this all the time and now suddenly it's too late?

With this in mind, but I know he's wanted a Vita since they came out but he never buys himself any games until they've been out a year or two.  So I bought him one, wrapped it up in a frilly pair of my bra and panties, and gave it to him after Sunday-morning-happy-birthday-nakkies at my place.  

He said he didn't want it.  I said too bad, I said no.  He asked for the receipt so *he* could take it back, and I said tough shit, he has to accept that people love him and want to give him shit and I didn't have the receipt anyway (a little lie; I kept the receipt in case I got the wrong games to go with it).

He got quiet, and went outside and smashed it.  He turned around at me and screamed, ""I told you not to get me anything!"" and hopped in his car and left.  Now he won't answer his phone and I'm just dumbstruck.

&gt;
&gt;I can cognitively understand the idea, media, movies, dating, adult industry, books- they tend to be catered to the man getting off, the man being attracted. The woman is the object of desire
&gt;
&gt;In my personal life- sex has generally ended when the man gets off
&gt;
&gt;It reminds me of the quote- ""Everything in the world is about sex

Now this might be unnecessary to tell but I'm not building up an ego - I am actually more hurt and confused by these comments than I'm flattered.

Because regardless if I get a lot of male attention, I flirt and I socialize. I just can't seem to find interest beyond sex. Some guys frankly behave really disrespectful to me, like they're entitled to have me when THEY feel like it.

After talking for a while we go to her room and lay down. As I'm laying there she slowly works her hand down towards my dick and starts giving me a handjob. She then proceeded to get up from the bed and gave me a pretty amazing blowjob. The only thing is, ""why didn't you tell me you were so horny?"" After it was evident that my whiskey dick wasn't going to do anything she asked, ""would you want to help me squirt?"" Uhh... does a bear shit in the woods? 

She goes in gets a towel and lays it under her. I put my fingers inside her, she starts GUSHING all over the bed and my jaw drops open. I take my hand away (which is soaking wet) and just look at her and kiss her.

Fellas, and to go out a few nights a week.

Growing up, went to college, and prepared for life. But you know when you're in school you don't know a damn thing about life? All you know is that tomorrow is the final exam and you've spent all month not preparing for it. Your prime concern was to make friends and pass your exams. **The Real World** was this mystical place that everyone talked about but really had no idea what it was. So you graduate and you trick yourself into thinking it's a piece of cake. After I graduated, I partied my ass off. Clubs, bars, raves, house parties, you name it, *Haaaaave you met Ted?*...literally that easy.

Then I met the girl I was going to marry. How did I know I wanted to marry her? Because for the first time I didn't have to try to be cool around her. I could just be me. She told me she didn't care about my income or my status, and I found a job ASAP so I could support us. She wasn't just my lover she was my best friend. A few years later she ended it, saying that I was just too stable and she wanted some danger in her life before she got too old. Essentially I was traded in for a spot on some guest list. This changed **everything**. I was suddenly alone, and very much aware of it. I couldn't understand what happened. I gave that relationship 110%. Hardwork was suppose to pay off right? Nope. Food stopped tasting good. The weather always seemed cloudy. I lost 40lbs in 2 months. She started sending me pics of her new boyfriends, and calling/texting me non-stop. This is still happening today. My parents finally asked me to go talk to a shrink. Recently, I asked her why she decided to burn our bridge, and she said because if she couldn't get a positive reaction out of me, and they might get married. I asked why she keeps calling me then. She doesn't know. Fuck.

That was 2 years ago, and even less of whom I can really trust. Loneliness is the killer. **ALL** of my buddies are either in long term relationships or engaged or married or have kids, and buying homes, and climbing the corporate ladders, or starting their own businesses, and the one single friend has become a recluse. On Friday night I'll literally go down my contact list and see what people are up to.

When I do make it out to the bars and clubs, I'm suddenly labeled as a *creeper* and I don't even really want to get into their pants, just looking for conversation! I dated one other girl (F22) which ended because I wanted to be with her and she wanted go meet more guys. Can't say I blame her, she was pretty, and I remember what it was like to be 22. Suddenly, I'm concerned with school shootings and recessions and interest rates and credit scores and gas mileage and healthcare.

I've been told that life will significantly improve when I'm 30, fitness, and career (interviewing for new jobs and studying for the GMATs). I'm just really confused about the way things turned out. I feel like those in relationships at my age are too scared to break up because they might end up like me. 

So each morning as I put on my tie and gel my hair I look into the mirror and I force myself to smile. As far as my co-workers are concerned, awesome family, a few friends, my apartment, my car...then why am I still so unhappy? So fellow redditors in my age group: **WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON?** How did you guys get through this? Does it get better? It's like I have so much pressure to succeed that it makes my head spin. **Should** I be buying a home? **Should** I be engaged? **Should** I be making 6 figures?

I (23/F) have a problem with my guy friends, or because I don't have feelings for them) they get upset and eventually creepy, as in stalking and random 4 am angry phone calls and so on. I keep losing friends and it hurts. I don't understand why this happens, it's not like I'm super good looking or anything, I'm pretty normal. I wonder if I send signals without realizing but I don't think so, I'm pretty obvious when I flirt. I have lost girlfriends because of this too, they get mad at me if the guy they like ends up with feelings for me. Other than a core group of friends that I made as a child I can't keep friends because of this. Is there anything I should do short of beginning my conversations with men with ""I don't find you attractive and while I would like to be friends because you seem decent I will never, ever date you"".

I almost always do the first choice, but I never just walk up behind and grab her without permission. But obviously, you see people do that all the time. Maybe I'm just a sap, but I feel like that's not cool. And as a result, I dance with far less girls than your average guy probably does, haha.

So, monogamous, happy/sexually fulfilling relationship, how often do you fantasize (sexually) about other women? I'm not talking about noticing a hot chick and going about your day. I'm talking about seeing a hot girl and then going home to fap to thoughts of her.

How often (percentage-wise) do you fantasize while masturbating? While getting a HJ? While getting a BJ? While having vanilla sex? While having (whatever passes for you) kinky sex?

Personally, never think about other men sexually. I have no desire to because i find my boyfriend just *that* damn sexy and fulfilling. I also don't watch porn (hate the stuff, but that's a different topic) and have no desire to start. 

I know everyone will see people on tv, etc and think ""that is one damn fine attractive man/woman"" (hell, i do too!), but i'm curious how often men will then go and fantasize sexually (aka while giving themselves or otherwise pursuing an orgasm), since it seems women generally don't.

I never really thought that I could have been raped and am still unsure of whether or not it's considered it or not. 

This happened 5 years ago. It was the first week that I started dating my gf, but a little too good. I was really scared of cumming because it was the first time having sex without a condom on and I knew for a fact that she wasn't on birth control. I told her that we should stop and that I didn't want to cum inside of her. I tried to get her off of me but she held my hands saying that it was okay and that I could cum inside of her. Admittedly this was kind of hot, being dominated like this and being told that I could cum inside. A few thrusts later, I came. I remember it very clearly. The pleasure of the moment combined with the anxiety and fear that came over me when cumming inside of her. I just got her pregnant and she was okay with it because we went to buy a Plan B right after. 

I never really thought anything of it because we were in a relationship and have been for so long now. This happened once

Thanks to everyone who replied and helped me.

So basically, respected each other and loved each other. No major fights or issues. We each did our own thing from time to time (I'm not really clingy). I thought I was the love of his life (or so he claimed).

His female best friend has known him since middle school. He kissed her once in high school but she never reciprocated (he had feelings for her). Fast forward to college, fall in love. Fiancé still kept in contact with best friend. I never had a problem with it (like I said, I'm not clingy and trusting) because I can't tell him who he can and can't be friends with. Over the summer, we would be long distance and they would hang out. I never had a problem with it.

Fast forward to present times. Fiancé proposed last month and we are in the midst of wedding plans. Female best friend calls him up and claims she is having a sort of mental breakdown. I tell him to go cheer her up. He does and then spends the rest of the week super distant. 

Today

So

I'm not really seeking words of advice or sympathy. I am just trying to make sense of what happened and whether I was really stupid and naive to be okay with my ex having a female best friend.

UPDATE: You guys have been great. I'm doing okay (chocolates and cat videos help). I'm also packing at the moment and will be staying at a girlfriend's house while I find my own place. I'm hoping to be gone before he gets back and I've decided that I will not speak another word to him or keep any contact.

Over the last year or so I've really come out of my shell and have built up a lot of confidence around women. Girls just seem to assume i've had tons of sex (even saying as much)

I've just always been picky I guess. I also hate the idea of pretending to have feelings for a girl when i don't

I don't really have any amazing sex drive that guys always seem to talk about

I'm considering just losing it and getting it over and done with. I'd just like to know some things:

1. Does your sex drive increase? Does sex become harder to resist? 
Is my current immunity to women's sexual charms (which i'm oddly proud of) something only a virgin could have?
Guys always talk about the psychological effects of going ""that long without sex"" (for example guys in the army etc.)

2. Does your view of women change?
I'm not a guy to go easy on girls (just for being girls) or to give them any sort of sexist special treatment. Does such an egalitarian mindset become harder to maintain? Do you start seeing women as more weak/vunreable/needing your care?
What about when you fall properly in love? If these urges are unavoidable
Or will I inevitably start seeing all women in this way?

Anything else that changes when you first have sex/a proper loving relationship?
Or am i just over-analyzing everything....

So first off

It took me a while to get a chance to speak to him alone but we finally got an opportunity last week. We went to lunch, proceeded to tell him how he comes off to a lot of people. I mentioned specific instances of inappropriate behavior with myself and a friend of mine as well as generic statements about girls at a gaming store we hang out at together. He seemed to take it well at first. He told me that another mutual male friend of ours had had almost this exact same conversation with him a few weeks ago. So I thought it was going well.
 
Then the denial started. While he did agree to back off of my friend since he knows for a fact that he has made her uncomfortable he shows no interest in changing any of his behaviors towards anyone else. He says that people from the outside commenting that his behavior is creepy doesn't bother him

I really don't know where to go from here. I want to help him. This stops him from making friends (and it definitely hinders his ability to hit on girls) but if he won't recognize the issue I'm not sure how to address it.

I must admit, lets not go into that). I know, I should love myself before I love anyone else, yadda yadda. But I'm horny, guys.

Anyway, less than 3 times a month, maybe. (I'm not a psycho who keeps count I'm just guesstimating.) Last night, it was before and then we put a regular movie on while we fucked. I'd like to think it was just to get himself hard since I had been sucking him for a while without getting him *super* hard. He *had* just cum a little while ago, this was going to be his second load. But the fact that I couldn't get him hard myself made me feel pretty bad.

It makes me feel like I'm not enough for him, you know? It gets to the point where I don't even want to have sex anymore and I want to tell him to just finish himself off because he obviously doesn't need me there.

I know he loves me very much but I just can't get over these thoughts. I would love some male perspective on this to really understand the situation. Is my insecurity just getting the best of me? Do you watch porn before or during sex? Why? If so

Findings from the research: [Link](http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2007/08/09/study_iq_linked_to_virginity.aspx).
&gt;Recent studies on sexual activity among adolescents and young adults show that being an ""average Joe"" may have benefits outside of the classroom. The studies show that female and male adolescents with an IQ score either below 70 or above 110 are more likely to be virgins. Adolescents with IQ scores ranging from 70 to 110 had the lowest probability of virginity, 80 percent of men and 75 percent of women lose their virginity. According to a survey held by Counterpoint Magazine at Wellesley College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), 60 percent of undergraduates at Wellesley are virgins and 47 percent of undergraduates at MIT are currently virgins.

Background: my bf had somewhat of a traumatic upbringing. His mom was abusive (mostly emotional, slapped him so hard his ear bled, etc. Awful. This has left him quite bitter, angry at the injustice of the world, resentful of the way he was treated, and how others can treat others so badly.


We were watching a movie tonight; he was drinking, screwing over husbands and loved ones. He continued to get frustrated throughout, and at a point I laid back down to put my head on his chest and told him we didnt have to continue watching. As I did this, he grabbed my forearm sharply and shoved me off of him, and spat out ""You chose this movie, so we will watch it until the end.""


I was shocked, voice raised, saying it was my fault he was angry, I have terrible taste in everything, that I know he had a difficult time growing up and how could I have suggested we watch it? And finished it with a ""Fuck you.""

Problem is, when blacked out, he backed me into a corner, screaming at me for defending the author of Game of Thrones because he was disgusted by a certain scene in the show that we've been watching together for the course of the series. He's gotten this angry maybe 3 times over the past 9 months. 


He doesn't seem to think it's abusive, my movie choice, etc. He's thrown things (not at me) and punched walls. It happens when he drinks a lot.


He swears he would never hit me, I'm sorry if that upset you.""


I love him and I wish it wasn't like this. 90% of the time we're wonderful. It's just his spitting rage is really scary.
Should I be more sensitive to things that might possibly be triggers for him? I agree that movie was a mistake. Is there any hope for anger reduction??

**Would you have casual sex with someone you find unattractive?**  How do you define that

So

Basically, I often feel insecure about my appearance thanks to some weight struggles and body issues, but it hasn't held me back from hooking up with guys who are very attractive pretty regularly.  I'm guessing this has a lot to do with how I carry myself socially, because I seem to have a much easier time finding guys than some of my better looking girl friends.  I'm pretty confident in my ability to approach guys and be charming, so I figure my chances are good if I pass the test of physical attraction to that particular guy.

Simply in terms of my appearance, kind of shook me up.  I know I'm not the hottest girl, and my size alone counts me out with some guys (I'm not huge or even what most would call fat, but I'm a size 12 hourglass with some chub), but I figured it was safe to assume the guys who seem into me think I look good.",,False,t5_2s30g,True

I think the reason that people have this impression is because it is accurate - for a small subset of the population. That subset is the most successful men with regards to dating

For these people

By definition, personality, status, etc. And, as the most attractive men also receive the most attention (again by definition) their viewpoints and likings are assumed to be the norm, as they are far more likely to have any individual women be attracted to them, and thus attempt to enage them.

It is odd; many women argue that, with the men who need something extra for an initial approach to be interesting have their likes and opinions overrepresented, as they are more attractive.

It's pretty much the same issue as women noticing that being forward in dating is not so well recieved as /r/askmen would lead them to believe; if the only ones being approached are the most attractive

We're both in our early 20's, had to leave school for money reasons, I feel I should note that her parents are insane, so distancing herself from them really helped us). I have a year and a half left, she has 1 year left, so theoretically we will finish at the same time if she comes back at the beginning of next year.

Anyway, but it sets up some back story/insight to my personality. I treat her to a nice night as an early birthday celebration, since I have exams during her actual birthday. While we're driving back from dinner, she's slightly inebriated and I'm sober, she mentions offhandedly that she tried cocaine recently(this isn't the big deal), and didn't find it very appealing. I pretty much get instantly annoyed, and while I know I can't control her actions/desires, and it put a damper on the good feels. I see trying cocaine as dangerous(yes

We're talking about it later, ""If you're still not telling me something, now's the best time to tell me for us to have the best chance of talking things out."" I'm paraphrasing. Got slightly more than I bargained for with that one.

So I find out a few months ago in August, during this party she got drunk, and invited an old friend(guy) of hers to watch a show with her(arrested development if you just have to know). During this, they apparently cuddled on the bed to watch (already getting a sick feeling from writing that, yeah I'm sensitive). So she says that he started grabing/touching her, and she responded by ""sucking on his thumb""(no shit). I guess he felt up her boobs/thigh, and she only ""sucked his thumb"". I am having a very hard time believing this, I probably would have been much more liable to believe her. The thing I feel the most annoyed by is how she kept it a secret.

We didn't discuss it for a bit because I had exams and some other academic things to do for the end of the semester, it takes a backseat to more long term things like school. Exams are over and I'm back at home getting over a relatively bad illness(totally fine). We're talking more, and the more we talk about the angrier I seem to feel. I've talked with some friends about it and some are telling me to run while others are saying it's not a big deal, get over it.

To me, or just advice on how people think I'm acting/overreacting/feeling. I'm feeling pretty tired and conflicted. Lying like this just really bothers me. Never thought I'd be in this position with this girl, or so conflicted about my emotions. As a side note, basically all the women I'm related to tend to cheat on their S.O.s, and I'm sure this is effects me. ( I can never remember affect vs. effect).

I love him and I want to contribute to his happiness in every way I can.

So I did some soul-searching. I've never been the jealous type - I am secure in my attachment style - and I'm pretty sure I can handle it if he has a one-night stand with some random woman and then comes back to me. So long as it's just about satisfying that sexual urge for some variety

I am inspired by the Ernest Hemingway quote where he says that his idea of heaven is ""two lovely houses in the town; one where I would have my wife and children and be monogamous and love them truly and well and the other where I would have my nine beautiful mistresses on nine different floors.""

But I rarely hear of an arrangement like this in practice except in the context of loveless marriages where the couple is staying together for the sake of the children

TL;DR: I just gave my SO permission to enjoy some casual sex outside of our relationship every once in a while. Am I naive for thinking he will continue to love me as before?

Edit:

&gt;aren't you concerned about him contracting diseases as he sleeps around?

I'm here asking for perspective on how it feels to be a male in a world of expectations. **What myths about being a male do you wish were entirely eradicated from the public conscious**. Why do you believe these ideas are still being propagated? Who propagates them? How do you react when you hear them being repeated? Do you ever try to correct others? Tell us your stories on what it really means to be a male in 2012. 

**Going even further** : Provide evidence/statistics to disprove such myths.

**Big Update**
I'd like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for participating and having these discussions. It's always exciting to see people learn something new about men. That being said

* Expected to succeed / No recognition of success

* Men as something to fear : Rape/murder/violence/pedophilia/intimidation

* Sex as accomplishment - the idea that there are winners/losers

* Men constantly want sex/hypersexualization of men

* Expectation to provide/protect/step in

* Men are simple creatures - Emotionless

* ""Man Up"" - Men can't ask for help/complain for fear of appearing weak

* Showing emotion = Weakness

* Masculinity as opposite of Femininity(mutually exclusive)

* Men just don't care - ""Don't give a fuck""

* Badass/Real Man/Idealization of male identity

* Unable to have meaningful relationships/afraid of commitment

I just started working at a Mexican restaurant a couple weeks ago and I've settled in. I like everyone there a lot, I'm 20) and for a long time he acted like the rest of the staff. However, the past week he started joking around with me, which consisted of holding my hands in front of me so I couldn't move and fake pushing me out of the patio door (he never got close besides holding my wrists) and joking in Spanish. It didn't bother me at all, whatever, people mess around.

However, doing those things. Then he got more playful and tried snapping me with a wet towel (having brothers growing up, I was up for it and even got him good a few times). So we were being goofy, chasing each other around the restaurant passing the time, which I never in my life expected to do with a manager. Then he got more bold, and began holding me again so I couldn't move, but this time he was right up against my back fully pressed into me. He did this a few times and I laughed it off, like sitting while he put ice cubes down my shirt, but towards the end I was looking forward to the arrival of more servers. When people were around

I'm not very up-front or assertive, so I don't want to do anything drastic.

So now I have a good looking boyfriend. He's always being hit on by other girls but he chose me and that makes me happy. He does, but..."", ""she's not bad, but..."" is how it always seems to go. And then he tells me that he always says, ""doesn't matter to me"" or ""she's great"" or something.

So now I'm torn. Yay my bf likes me for who I am and not necessarily what I look like. It still upsets me, but that's not always how it comes across. I guess a part of me doesn't want to hear ""it's not about looks"", I want to hear ""she's beautiful even if you don't think so"". (becaus it almost sounds like he agrees with them, despite having reasons for dating me)

Is it irrational of me to be upset by this/want more from him or should I truly be happy with his responses?

Does it change things for you? Do you still see the girl as your friend or just someone you can go back to and hook up with whenever? Or is it subjective. 

Essentially does it alter the friendship and the way you look at the girl?

Do you guys ever talk about it with the girl or do you generally take it as

Edit: By hook up I mean anything. Sex or just kissing someone. The general shift of being platonic friends to then realizing the potential to do things platonic friends don't do.
