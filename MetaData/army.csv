I have received a set of the new PT uniform prototype for a 45 day testing. After the 45 days I'll have to give feedback on how I feel about it. They have made some nice changes for each piece of the uniform.

For the shorts there is a spandex like underlining, one for the keys like the old shorts and and ID pocket on the spandex part. Also the shorts feel really nice on my skin, the texture is smooth and silky. They are longer in length so no ranger panty's.

The short sleeve shirt feels nice too

The PT jacket looks great in my opinion. The cuffs are looser to so you don't get that balloon effect. The PT pants are easy to put on and off now

So if you have any questions on the prototype PT uniform please feel free to ask. As a note I want to say sorry for the poor quality I only have a camera on my phone.",self,t5_2qtr8,False,,signal,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1exgre/new_pt_uniform_prototype/

We met at the base of the Wata Pur Valley where we met with the Route Clearance Package. A specialized team used to clear routes of improvised explosive devices. A great thing to have, so driving multi ton armored vehicles on these roads was especially nerve wracking. At some parts one side of the vehicle would rub against the mountain, while if I looked out of my window I would stare down a steep cliff, then we would take a turn and I would have to navigate around a gigantic boulder and a rock slide, or whatever else could go wrong or slow the mission up. It can take up to two hours to make the journey no longer than 5 miles. 


We finally reached the village of Qatar Kala, leaving two guns facing to the north, and two on the other side of the district center, facing Qatar Kala to the south, we had one more vehicle left where the road forked around the District Center. There was also a small sniper team and a few riflemen in an over watch position in the mountains to the Northeast of the village.  After Route Clearance uncluster fucked themselves and got on their way we went to ground. I went to the district center to help the platoons Forward Observer set up his Satellite communications. This was half of our mission, our medic was also setting up and we would be giving free medical care to any villager that stopped by. Being as how they were in the habit of using cow shit to patch holes in the walls of their homes, any chance to get medicine was something to get in line for. We also gave out food, sugar


I got back to the truck and joined in on the miracle of minds that is lower enlisted Infantrymen making small talk. We ran through the usual; “Who’d You Rather?”, Kill”, “How much would it cost for you bang a guy”. We covered all the scholarly stuff, and the conversation turned to killing. The mortar guys talked about how it didn’t bother them, it was indirect fire so they didn’t see it and felt no impact. Then T shocked us all. He said he hoped he had never shot anybody, and that he would never have to. This is practically sacrilege in the Infantry. Even if you think it, you’d never say it. It’s like correcting an old man for saying a derogatory word about an Asian dude. You just don’t, we talk about them as though they are sub human. This isn’t anything new. This is what soldiers do. This is what we must do. We have to dehumanize our enemy, asked him what he had been doing during those fights he had been in if he wasn’t trying to kill the enemy. Trying to kill those wishing to do harm to him and his brothers. We asked him if we could trust him in our turret and he swore we could.


We had been in position for about an hour, they put us on edge. We noticed one of them checking out the setup of our mortar tube so we told him to leave. We wanted to detain him, but had no grounds to do so.  About an hour later we set up gun rotations in the truck, because sitting in a sling in the sun for hours is draining and more awful than it sounds. That’s when I heard the first shot fire. It was a sniper round. I woke up the mortarmen, had to slap H in the helmet to get them alert. Then we started getting rifle fire from multiple positions. We were officially under enemy contact, but had no idea what was coming out way.  


Our mortar guys got out of the truck and started to hang 60mm high explosive rounds. Not wanting to just sit behind the drivers wheel I asked SGT D if I could go give them a hand. He said yes so I grabbed the vehicles extra Mk46 light machine gun and a few drums of ammo and ran over to them. As soon as I opened the driver door  I could hear rounds cracking past me, not taking it seriously. Idiots. I was teaching them about how the Mk46 worked and letting them shoot it, and they were teaching me how to fire a mortar.  Then it got serious. The district center was on the valley floor, and well over 100 heavily armed Taliban had slipped into fighting positions surrounding us. All at the same time Rocket Propelled Grenades, and heavy machine gun fire rained down on us from all sides. I was stunned momentarily. I finally came to as I saw H and N sprinting back to the vehicle for cover. They had a few seconds lead on me. I jumped up, and sprinted back to the truck. I’ve never ran so fast in my life. My chest was on fire, my body crushing under the weight of armor, and water, It was the only thing giving us any cover. I reached in for my M4 and saw it was gone. H had taken it, and fired. Silence. Nothing. Misfire. I fired again. Silence. Then a Rocket Propelled Grenade hit the driver side tire


I couldn’t believe it. Six months in country, grabbed T, and pulled him out of the vehicles gun turret and got behind the 240b machine gun. I had entered a new world. I could hear rounds firing off, and cracking past my head at almost the same time, I could hear them hitting the shield in front of, and the ballistic glass all around me. I could see multiple muzzle flashes from multiple positions. I let a 200 round burst go into the village, spraying hundreds of 7.62mm rounds into the windows. Normally you would never do that large of a burst of gunfire, 60mm Mortar tube, I had to let them know we were in the fight and there to win it. 


I dropped back down and yelled at T to prep cans of ammo for me.  240b cases can be a pain in the ass if not prepped because the canister has two 100 round belts in separate boxes. They have to be removed from their separate boxes, and are losing. That’s when it becomes a seconds game and every second counts. I saw SGT D standing over T, my M4 jammed under his vest, into his ribs. He was screaming at T for his cowardice. Asking him why he shouldn’t kill him. I didn’t care. In those moments, T valued his life over ours, and he showed it, when we were all willing to die for each other.  I shook my head, and stood up to reload. I saw SGT D step out with a LAW rocket and fire at a nearby enemy position.


That’s when the call came in over the radio. We had taken a casualty at our overwatch position. One of the snipers had taken a AK47 round through his shoulder. They were blowing claymores to stop the Taliban advance on their position. I We could not get to them,  heavy machine guns firing, a constant barrage of mortar and artillery fire, and an aerial bombardment made a deafening indescribable sound. I remember at one point taking a breather, and making peace with the fact that I would die defending that position that day. Then I got right back up and into the fight. By the end of the fight I personally fired over 8,000 rounds at the enemy.


Rounds were cracking by, two 120mm Mortars nearby, and our 60mm was hanging rounds. The explosions were constant and deafening . Reloading the 240 seemed impossible. I had so much adrenaline, and fear, and hate coursing through me that my hands were trembling. I opened the latch, and was able to sweep out the links and casings but I fumbled with the new belt. My hands were shaking furiously. I tried to calm down and control my breathing. Precious seconds tick by, as dozens, as I am standing and exposing my entire upper body fumbling with this ammo.

1369536845.0,1f2a85,I am a new soldier but I love the army already,E-Fuzzy,113,34,56,So i am so happy to be in the army i got my first choice of job 11X and i made it to my first duty station i wanted to go to bragg where all the hard core soldiers go and i got to go there i picked airborne and my recruiter got that for me too he really helped me out we got a pass at bragg so i got to go off post and see somethings like the airborne museuem which i will be inducted into j/k i got a tattoo the aa just like the 82nd guys all have to get i also got RANGER because even though i am not a ranger yet my recruiter said i will get first shot at it because of my pt score. The sergeants here are so cool a couple even took me out for a few beers even though i am only 20 years old they took me to this bar where the women dance topless the sergeant who took me said that he could get me beers if i acted cool and paid him 10 dollars a beer and let him get them from the bar i thought the price was a bit high but since he knew the owner and all and he said the owner would look the other way on my age if i paid more i got to drink beer for the first time i also met a girl at this bar she dances topless and said that she likes me i know that she really likes me because she said that she could get in trouble if she didnt dance for me in the back room i took her too but instead we just stayed there and talked she told me about her three kids and how hard it is to find a good guy with her job i think i really like her we are going out tomorrow so i can meet her kids when she charged me 200 dollars for the time spent in the back room i gave her 250 because she said she only got to keep the tips and the rest had to go to the bar i know 50 dollars isnt enough to pay for her college that she says she is going to but i really hope this works out she is way more beautiful than any other girl i have been with tomorrow i am going to buy a car so i can take her out there is a car salesman i met at the bar he has an office just off post and he said he can get me a mustang for 400 dollars a month that will leave me enough to pay for this brand new phone i bought today that is why this is not formatted correctly i dont know how to work the dam thing I LOVE THE ARMY,t5_2qtr8,True

1375546350.0,1jmqe0,A long-winded rant/vent session regarding the current counseling environment (IMHO),SlinkyJoe,50,1,44,"I have a Soldier who runs to the nearest CSM everytime she is counseled. It's happened multiple times. The CSM hands her a ""get out of jail free"" card everytime and backs her. He calls my NCOIC into his office and proceeds to bash him and pick apart every counseling statement or email like a lawyer. He ***always*** backs our worst Soldiers. She's wrong. Everyone in my shop knows it. She's a terrible NCO. Totally unreliable. Lazy. Despised by her subordinates. She'll put more effort into trying to find ways ***out*** of work than it would take to just do her job. We're coming up on the end of a tour. My NCOIC and I sat down and wrote her NCOER. It's not even bad. He's been in a while and so have I and we both grew up in a different Army. Even just 5-6 years ago to me it seems like it was a much different Army. We both grew up in a system that was not anywhere near as insane about documenting everything as today's Army. I've never had a group of Soldiers in my Company/Battalion/Unit that were such a bunch of barracks lawyers. As a result

It's gotten to the point now that we've been discouraged so much from counseling poor/non-performers (as have many others in this Unit) that we stopped doing it. We had to. Every negative counseling was picked to shreds by the CSM/BC (until the CSM got booted out of theater - then she simply went to the next higher CSM - it's her M.O.). After enough times we both stopped doing it. It wasn't worth the ass pain we'd have to put up with, overall 3's represent an overall ""good"" rating. Since when does every NCO get 2's guaranteed to them? When did 2's become average, and 3's become poor? I digrees - anyway, so then she proceeds to print out every email and counseling she's received so far during the tour, walks over to the 1SG's office, tells her she's going to BDE to talk to the CSM (open door policy), and leaves. Not a word to anyone else in her chain. BDE CSM calls my NCOIC up to his office and proceeds to pick apart his emails and counselings. ""You didn't explain in enough detail how to do this task"", ""you can't negatively counsel if you didn't provide retraining (on an MOS task)""

WHAT DOES THIS ACCOMPLISH? HOW DOES THIS HELP THE ARMY? WHY WOULD A SENIOR NON-COM THROW ANOTHER SENIOR NON-COM UNDER THE BUS FOR A CRAP NCO? He even said ""good Soldiers don't come by to see me about this stuff. Only poor performers come through trying to find loopholes"". He ***knows*** she's trying to get over

So we're rolling over. She gets a free ride and some other Unit will inevitably pick her up where she'll do it all over again. We had two negative counseling statements lined up for failing to accomplish a task and for showing up late to work before she ran to BDE to cry to the CSM. Now they're toilet paper

This is happening because of two reasons

1. We have been discouraged from counseling Soldiers negatively. All they have to do is run to mommy or daddy and they don't have to be held accountable for their actions. Mommy said no? Daddy too? Run to grandpa. Sooner or later someone in the chain is going to find fault and blame the leadership. ""Coach, they'll say. And we'll lose the backing of higher. The Boss will get a phone call. He'll tell me in his best lawyer-speak to let it go. And it'll slide.

2. As a result of #1 up there we'll get to the NCOER and there won't be enough negative counselings to give anything less than a 2/2. The NCO will get promoted. The vicious cycle will continue.

Some people will say they're right. But its getting to the point now where you have to pass the bar exam to write a counseling statement. One wrong word, and when it comes time to evaluate no one is around to back your assessment of the Soldier's potential. It's like everyone gets a participation medal or something. 
This compounds the issue that the word of leadership no longer counts for crap. Verbal counselings don't exist. They are meaningless. If you don't spend all day documenting the shortcomings of poor performers, then the Soldier gets away with murder. My current problem child is at the point now where ***every single task*** she is assigned requires a step-by-step instructional counseling statement outlining what her duty entails in perfect detail. If one item is missed, or the job changes at all, you have to write a new statement or else she won't be held accountable.

Whatever happened to the days of the verbal order? The days when a Soldier was told to do a task

Maybe it's just this unit. Maybe it's just me. I don't know. But I've never seen anything like it before. And most every leader/senior leader in my vicinity is complaining about the same issue. We've been ham-stringed by regulation and a series of higher leaders who refuse to back their subordinate leadership if a Soldier wants to complain about having to do her damn job. 

Anyways this issue has had me fuming all day and I just wanted to get it off my chest. I'm sure lots of you have dealt with problem Soldiers before - hell

tl;dr: It seems to me more and more everyday - leadership is not being backed on counseling/NCOERs. You can't counsel without being a lawyer

First of all

ROTC is a program designed to commission officers in the United States military. Although designed to take 4 years, such as if you already have a bachelors and are going for a masters).

For the 3 year program

For a 2 year program

That being said, there's a 5-year plan for you guys), if you are an incoming sophomore, you can only enroll in the 3-year option, and if you're an incoming junior, there's no way to participate in ROTC unless you can get a slot to LTC, or have prior military service. There is an exception if you plan on going to grad school

Now, which, including lab, is between 4-7 hours of the week. PT is 3 days a week, typically Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings and you show up to those sessions in your PT uniform. Outside of those commitments, you're free to live your life as a normal college student.

Going into the financial aspect of ROTC. First, enrolled Cadets, and contracted Cadets. Participating means you're just taking the MS lecture, and perhaps the PT class. There's no paperwork, and you have not agreed to serve in the Army. A participating Cadet will not be able to attend labs or FTXs. An enrolled Cadet is someone who is taking the MS lecture, PT class, as well as signed up for the lab. There is more paperwork to clear you to attend labs, there's no distinguishable difference from a participating Cadet.

Contracted Cadets, background check for security clearance, ect). All contracted Cadets draw a stipend and book money. Stipend starts at $300 a month for an MS I Cadet, and increases to $500 a month for an MS IV. Once you've contracted with ROTC, you can also compete for a scholarship. This is an important point to understand: Although scholarships are competitive, you do not have to have a scholarship to commission through ROTC. 

The scholarships through the schools are generally 3-year or 2-year scholarships

I think that's enough information to get us started. I'll answer all questions posted here, PM me and I'll help get the paperwork started for you and put you in contact with a ROO.",,False,self,t5_2qtr8,False,medicalservice,

1370414889.0,1fphdq,The 68W (Combat Medic/Healthcare Specialist) FAQ,HeyPrivate,38,7,52,"I have seen more questions about this MOS than any other so I figured it was about time we had one of these. I'm going to do my best to answer the most commonly asked questions and I invite my fellow medics to add to this FAQ to their heart's content. I especially welcome input from the newer medics in regards to the training practices.

----------------------------------

* **What do 68W's do?**

Medics, you will examine and treat patients under the license of a higher practitioner such as a Physician's Assistant or Doctor. As a combat medic you will be deployed with your fellow Soldiers and potentially providing emergency care in combat. These two jobs are both under the purview of the 68W and you will be expected to be proficient in either role as the situation warrants.

-----------------------------------

* **What kind of training will I undergo?**

After you have graduated BCT you will be sent to Fort Sam Houston, providing the medical training for all branches. Army 68W AIT is approximately 16-18 weeks long depending on when you go. The first half of AIT is the EMT course, where you will gain national certification as an Emergency Medical Technician-Basic, provided you pass the NREMT certification test. Failure to pass after a certain number of attempts will result in being removed from the rest of the course and processed for reclassification to another MOS. Once you have finished the EMT course, the rest of AIT is comprised of combat medicine training, consisting of things such as combat casualty care, advanced airways, trauma management

This portion of your training culminates in a two-week Field Training Exercise (FTX) at Camp Bullis

----------------------------------------

* **Alright, what about downtime?**

This is where your mileage may really vary, you were released to do your own thing, as long as you didn't leave the company area. On weekends, if your company was given an off-post pass, you could travel off Fort Sam to do whatever it is you felt like doing. If it was an on-post pass, you couldn't leave the base, but you could travel freely (more or less) on the base itself to do things like go to the Main Exchange or the Shoppette. Smoking was allowed in designated areas

-------------------------------------

* **This sounds easy! But is there anything I can do to get a head start?**

Sure. If you currently hold an NREMT certification, you will be fast-tracked into a company that is starting the Whiskey (combat medical) training.
If you don't want to do that

-------------------------------------

* **Ok

Once again, with the rest going to support units such as a Combat Support Hospital or medical units. You may be deployed right away, or you may never deploy; such is the way of the Army.

-----------------------------------------------

* **I have a question that you somehow managed not to answer in that long-winded tirade!**

You're a big boy or girl now

-----------------------------------------------

That's it for now. As always
------------------------
-------------------------------------

EDIT 1:

According to [this post here](http://redd.it/1ffkvi) TRADOC policy now prohibits overnight passes and alcohol consumption

------------------------------------

EDIT 2:

I can't believe I forgot to include this the first time. Yes, FALL IN LOVE WITH OR MARRY THESE FEMALES. JUST DON'T DO IT. I HEAR YOU THINKING ABOUT IT. YES, EVEN YOU. DON'T DO IT. THEY ARE TRIFLING BITCHES.**

**THAT GOES FOR YOU TOO LADIES.** 

Seriously, but there are plenty of sex shops in San Antonio and your PSG will be much less pissed if he/she finds a fleshlight/vibrator in your locker than if you come down with the down-below-drips.

--------------------------------------

EDIT 3: I Found an old post I wrote about Bullis so you get a bonus.

&gt;It's either going to be cold as fuck or hot as hell. There is no middle ground. When I went through it was January and therefore cold as fuck. We were in hemi-tents with heaters that worked maybe twice a week. We were there for two weeks. There's no tobacco or anything but water allowed. Of course that didn't stop anybody. There was a civilian service that did our laundry at the end of the first week. They take it off site and bring it back within a day or two.

&gt;Each platoon cycled through the training lanes because there weren't that many instructors. The instructors out there are cool as shit but don't fuck up or they'll make you regret it. You'll basically be relearning room clearance, we had a ""supply shortage""). The most memorable part for me was being forced to stay up for 36 hours then being put through a combat stress run in the BAS. You'll be doing lots of marching, running, dragging, and all that other fun shit so make sure you're in shape. Chow was MREs except for dinner, which was hot As.

&gt;Each platoon cycled through platoon leaders

&gt;The second week is ""War Days"" and you'll just have to find out about that for yourself.

 First

**Skill level 1 (PVT-CPL (SPC)**: Get some college. College won't do a lot for you know

 Do those schools that are offered to you. It doesn't matter if it is Ranger school, or First Aid. You want to get the schools done as early in your career as you can so you can get more done later if needed. 

This applies throughout your career, but if you start in a clinic, hospital, or office job, try to get into a deployable position. 

**Skill Level 2:** You need a leadership position. Squad leader, right? If you cannot get a leadership position, make sure you can demonstrate on your NCO-ER that you are remaining technically proficient. Did you conduct training? Did you create a training model?

Get those schools that you didn't get to do when you were skill level 1. Again, or advanced or specialized training in your MOS or CMF. 

You can volunteer for special duty

**Skill Level 3:** At this point you should not have to worry about college. You should at least have your Associate's Degree. Continue to work toward your Bachelor's Degree. Ideally, Drill Sergeant, Instructor, something of that sort.) 

Let's say you have made it to this point in your career and you have been in TDA assignments for your entire career and you can't seem to break the cycle. Go to boards. I don't mean the NCO of the Quarter Board. I mean the NCO of the Year Board. Audie Murphy Board, are all ways to overcome the lack of TOE assignments. You should be working to achieving EFMB or EIB if that is available to you. 

**Skill Level 4:** You should have at least an Associate's Degree. You should have your Bachelor's Degree if you can't show a lot of deployment time. If you can still get a special duty and you have not had one before

**Skill Level 5:** If you get a 1SG position offered

**Tips throughout your career.** Keep in mind that branch knows what is best for you. If branch is telling you to take an assignment

Let me start by saying that I've never fully understood the policy against keeping pets overseas.  I've played with a few puppies and cats that lived on our base while deployed, I think that I finally figured out the *why* behind the policy. 

I've had the opportunity to work with a few Army Medical folks (Doctor-types), originally a reddit post, has been making a few rounds in the Medical Community: http://nation.foxnews.com/military/2013/02/06/soldier-takes-nap-adopted-cat-kuwait So, I asked the doctor types to explain it to me.

The big fuss is over rabies, yes we have shots, but thats not the issue.  An untreated rabies bite can turn into a case of Clinical Rabies.  How serious is that?  Well, according the the CDC, less than 10 people have survived Clinical Rabies.  Not 10 people this year, 10 people *ever.* 
**Source 1:** http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/symptoms/index.html

Granted, the Army has a complex dynamic, where those who seek help are thought of as weak, as in the case of the stigma associated with mental health treatment.  As a result, many do not seek help when they may need it.

Case in point

I know that I'm not going to prevent anyone from keeping pets overseas


Rabies is pretty serious and can be transmitted via bite or saliva.  If you do come into contact with either

* Have someone other than your sponsor look over your uniform before you go into the board. Your sponsor has seen your uniform a few times and knows what fixes he suggests. Get another NCO to look at your uniform to find the things your sponsor doesn't see. 

*  Listen to the questions asked. You may not think you know the answer, and he had no answer. He wanted the study guide answer, but I wanted the fast answer of call 911. 

* Be confident. Hell, I will give you more points than if you look at your hands and say, I don't know at this time, Sergeant. 

* Be loud. Everything you do in the Army can be loud. When you do facing movements

* Do what you are asked to do. You can do it. The president of the board tonight asked the participants to sing the NCO Creed. No one took the challenge.

I'm in the Army. I'm an E-4 and I've been with my current unit for almost 3 years. I went on leave in the last week of May.

Before I left, and that I needed to submit a 4187 in order to be put in the class in July. Mind you, this is after my leave had already been approved. I got with the schools NCO, submitted my 4187 and was told it was taken care of and I didn't have anything to worry about.

Yesterday, 1SG is yelling in the background that I'd better ""get (my) ass back here"".  I talked to my first line and he wasn't tracking anything. He said he would call but then said he never got through to our platoon sergeant. 

The class is a half-day recertification class that happens several times a month. I'm on leave with family that I won't see again until after deployment and a wedding that I took leave to be here for hasn't even happened yet. My leave was approved weeks before I left. 

My return tickets are already bought and paid for and I cannot afford to pay for different ones or to have it rescheduled.

What can I do? What can I expect my punishment to be if I don't go back for this class?

You need approx. 20 classes to earn an associates degree. If you start when the Army gives you your 4, and take just two classes a semester, you can have your degree in just shy of 2.5 years. That's including taking April through August off. (I'm using the prices for my school, UMUC, which would be higher than a local community college. If your tuition is lower, the quicker you can get your degree).

1. Don't ever say can't or won't. That is the quickest way to get sent home. You can

2. Don't spend all your money on the stupid s**t the vendors try t  sell you. Many people come in and this is their first time to have money in their pocket. You want to come out of BCT with a few dollars to your name. The Drill Sergeants may say you won't be released until someone buys from the vendor, the coffee mugs, the whatever. You can get this stuff at a better price when you get to AIT.

3. Buy the unit T-shirt. Seems to contradict the above, buy two and have your class sign one. They don't cost much. 

4. Write home. It doesn't matter if you have anyone who reads your letters. What is important is that you remember that you have someone to write to. It also helps you see that it ain't that bad. When you put it down in words

5. When you do call home

A little background about me so you know where I stand: I am an MSIII SMP cadet attending a decent public university (BA Economics). I am enlisted in the Guard as an 11B which will be null once I commission. I also plan on serving only my required time (min. 4 years). Who knows

I am fairly confident that I will be ranked in the top 10% based on my OML

To give you an idea of where I am on my OML: 3.7 or 3.8 GPA, some extracurriculars (IM sports) and I'm aiming for an E at camp hopefully with Recondo.

I have three branching options that I have in mind and was wondering if any currently serving officers or retired could offer me any input.

1. Branch AV: Why? Flying would just honestly be kick-ass and exciting. I like adventure and I believe aviation would provide me with that in excess. The downside I see is that I'm not sure how applicable that is after I retire.

2. Branch IN: Why? I have ""some"" experience in this branch and I like the aspects of being a PL of a combat arms branch. The downside is the same as if I branched Aviation.

3. Branch MI and branch detail IN/AR: Why? I believe this would give me the most experience in different fields for the limited time I would be serving. It would also give me great experience to transition into the civilian sector. 

I know ultimately the decision lies with me and that my decision also depends on what I plan to do after I retire. However

As to what I'd like to do after I retire

Thank you in advance!

So last night I was at a crazy wedding celebration and in a partial family setting I was confronted with much negativity on my thoughts of joining the Army or any military branch (with small exception of the Air Force).  

The funny part is that up until now I've never really been confronted by any of my immediate family due to the lack of caring and interest

My mother has basically said nothing about me joining the Army.  With the random exception that ""it might be good for you"".  


Something I didn't quite expect to happen during the party: my cousins repeatedly sat down with me to tell me extremely negative views of the military, so I took what they had to say lightly; but my cousins also claimed to have a lot of military friends that had experienced nothing but negativity from their active duty.  Their conclusion was that if I joined the Army I would be in the front lines, the first to be expended and used.  Now this sort of implies that I'd be a grunt- but my goal is to be medical in the Army (or Airforce).

Then I had someone, using women's track times and PFT results as one example.  This guy and most of the people at the party seemed, I want to say ignorant and even extreme, but the man served for 6 years beginning in 1992 and I have not.  Although very notably, he was dishonorably discharged and seemed like a trouble-maker from his recollections.

Stunningly though, who had been serving for over 20 years before retiring.  She loved the airforce and shared her positive and negative experiences of her job of being a B52 pilot (I'm a little fuzzy on the details here since I was drinking, but she was a pilot of something- derp) when it was amazingly rare for women to have this kind of position.  I very much enjoyed everything she had to say, even hearing that she served in the Vietnam war, transporting thousands of caskets, and her very close calls.  AND her losing her dearly loved husband in the military who followed her nearly everywhere.  Now she was the most willing to talk in depth about her experience and didn't hold back details.

First about me, active recruiter wouldn't give it to me)
was talking to my S2/G2
For the past 7-ish months we have had a group of prior service guys come to our unit with this huge training event
Being the only recently trained 35F I was asked to join these staff drills to help with the S2 shop
These drills for me was at first just being in the back, after which the 2 kept me at his side at all times, mainly having the two of us stay up with the 3 and XO into 12-1 AM and getting up at 5-6ish, the other month I was awarded a coin and told by the CSM, HHC 1SG and HHC CPT that they were all very impressed, 
to put it simply and sound conceited

Now my questions (for any prior/current service/35F/11B/18X


-What is it actually like being deployed in an S2 shop? I mean i was told all the BS AIT rumors
but seriously? I know it depends on Deployment but any insight other then that would help.

-Directed mainly to 11B, I've heard some pretty bad stories on how the intel guys haven't had enough and gotten some guys seriously messed up, In a DIGEX the S3 messed up bad and kinda dismissed my prediction of OPFOR in this town, he said there couldn't be, I told him i predicted at least X, and there was X times 2 we lost alot of guys, and I still cant stop beating myself up over it

-mainly to NG or NG to Active re ups, But I Don't want to fuck over this unit, I know a few guys in the companies, and I fee like i owe it to the unit, I am seriously one of 3 recently trained 35F in this BN any advice here will be helpful

I'd like to give as many details as to were we are going

Well I have a few questions that have been on my mind and are in no specific order.

-Boots. I have the basic training standard issue

-Extra clothing. I already have 6 (brand new) t-shirts and 5 pairs (brand new also) of Fox River socks ready to be packed and shipped to our new home. All of this is on top of what I have already and use on a daily basis. Should I splurge and buy more brand new clothes?

-Underwear. Any suggestions? I free balled for a month at NTC. Don't want to soil my brand new issued gear.

-Reading material. Is there any specific books or references I can read prior to deploying to give me some insight on OPFOR's tactics? Last thing I want is being on a patrol not knowing what the enemy is capable of.

-Special workouts. Besides our morning PT

-High Speed hooah gear. Figured I may as well become a ""gear queer"" and spend a little extra money on gear that will be above the standard. I'm thinking about making my rifle (SI M4) lighter and more customized to myself. Any suggestions on how about to do this?

This is all I have thus far

The problem is primarily logistics. I'm based in HI, we're the same age and have comparable accumulated stuff, etc. She's got strongly established roots. A life. Considering all this, it'd be enormously expensive and difficult to move all this to HI. I'm trying to figure out how to do this without destroying our respective bank accounts, and to minimize the detrimental impact on her. My greatest fear is that coming out here might feel like giving up her entire life. This is our (though she doesn't quite come out and say it) biggest reservation at this point.

1333126715.0,rl4x8,My great uncle passed away this morning. He served in the Army during the Vietnam war. This is a letter he wrote me in 2005 per my request to interview him for a Veterans report I was writing.,purpleghost89,11,1,4,"I was born in Phoenix, I now like to go to casinos and do a little gambling. 

I will start when I was drafted by the U.S. Army in June, California for advanced training. My first permanent unit was with the 41st artillery headquarters in Ft. Still, Oklahoma. That was the unit I was with when we were sent to South Vietnam in April of 1967. We were flown from Oklahoma City, OK to Oakland, California where we boarded the USNS Geiger, U troop transport ship for our travel to South Vietnam. The trip took 18 days, which included 3 days of of seasickness for me. Our arrival was in Quihnon, Vietnam. For your info

In September of 1967 I was promoted to the rank of Specialist 5th class

During the month of January 1968 was the time that that the people of that country celebrated their holy days. We called it the Tet New Year. During one night that month all units of U.S. services were attacked by North Vietnam armies along with Viet Cong (South Vietnam communist fighters). That had to be the bloodiest days for U.S. troops. There were a lot of Americans killed and twice as many enemy troops killed. Some of the cities were taken over by communist units and it took weeks of fighting to get them back. In April 1968 I was sent back to the United States and reassigned to hospital personnel

As far as medals, I became ill and was taken in for tests. It was determined by V.A. hospital doctors that my legs had been damaged by agent orange. I am now helped by the V.A. hospital. There is still no cure for what I have. My legs from the knew down are numb and hurt everyday. The only thing that doctors can do is to give me pain pills for the pain. 

I have lost track of any of my buddies that Belonged to the same units with me. As an American I was mad as hell to see how someone could do this to our country. I was glad that our president sent troops to weed out those responsible. As far as Iraq

The national security in this country has now made all Americans think that we are no longer as secure as we thought we were. We now try to question any package that is left behind. We will have to safe guard this country of ours so that one day we can feel as safe as we used to. I don't think it will happen any time soon, I probably won't be here but, this country has got to stop being the protector of all countries. As we have seen, this country has sent troops to all parts of the world. We are now weak since we don't have the troops to handle every problem that comes up. This is, and should be, the problem for the United Nations, not just the U.S. We should and must remember countries like France who have depended on the United States to save them during any war...and what thanks does this country get. We are hated and shunned by our friends. I know that our country can only count on small nations and countries like Great Britain and Australia to help us. Hopefully we will be able to protect this country when the time comes. ",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/rl4x8/my_great_uncle_passed_away_this_morning_he_served/

I can do a grand total of 3 push-ups right now. Any tips on doing more?

And the kicker- 
I have a...shall we say top heavy body type. And even with constant workouts I'm not losing any weight :/ So I'm not super overweight or anything, I weighed in at 158 one week, and 167 less than a week later, only to drop back down to 164 the day after coming in at 167....how do I make sure I make weight when it comes time to ship?

I'm going for a position that requires a Secret clearance. I had a conviction as a juvenile. I'm not sure exactly what the charge ended up being or felony/misdemeanor/etc. but it was a pretty serious crime. I've done everything I can to forget it. It was a bad decision, as much as I remember. He told me it didn't come back on my record and I need to just forget it again. The 1Sgt in charge also said the same thing. Said it wouldn't matter for a secret clearance, and probably not for a TS/SCI clearance either. 

I've also got quite a bit of debt. I was told to forget this, most from student loans for a degree I never completed. I was told I can't get a TS/SCI because of it since they will pull my credit, but that I should have no problem getting a Secret as they shouldn't even look at my credit for it.

I've noticed that when a joe screws up they get put on blast

When a senior nco or officer screws up (save generals raping someone) it is under wraps. Example being my unit had a brigade sgt maj get drunk at a get together with officers and after disagreeing about college football said sgt maj knocks the officer down and kicks him in the mouth breaking his jaw. Afterwards the sgt maj drives home drunk and is later arrested for aggravated assault and dwi. 

I found our about this from a SPC

This sgt maj was notorious for holding quite public incident reviews whenever a soldier screwed up at anything. From spousal abuse to speeding tickets he tore into soldiers and NCOs alike. When he screwed up I was wondering who would hold hid incident review but it never came.

I briefly spoke to a Recruiter on Friday but would like the opinions of those of you who have served or are serving.

- I have a GED and some college so I meet the requirements but was thinking of taking a semester full time at a local community college prior to enlisting. In your experience does more or recent college experience make much of a difference if you don't have a degree? 

- I am mostly interested in Military Intelligence and should have no problem passing the ASVAB in the 95th percentile. My line scores shouldn't be a problem either but my credit might be an issue for these positions because they all seem to require clearance. I have a little less than $10

- If I do have to choose an MOS outside of MI will I be able to put in for retraining once my credit is straightened out? How likely are they to allow you to change career paths once initially trained?

- Which MOS choices that don't require security clearance are good to learn skills that will translate well to MI positions. My ultimate goals are 35F with eventual 35P. I am very interested in linguistics.

I know the standard (read recruiter) answers for some of these but I know that because none of you have a vested interest in my enrollment you aren't going to be as likely to sugar-coat the answers. I really appreciate any insight you could give me. I like to have things well thought out and prepare for multiple scenarios. Even if I can't do MI I am still interested in joining the service. I'll just have to re-evaluate my goals.",self,t5_2qtr8,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/13diby/31yo_f_almost_ready_to_just_sign_the_papers_and_go/

I spoke to them about the possibility of passing within those 45 days, is to be separated into the IIR, something they told me is at the CO's discretion. 

What bothers me is that both the CO and the SGT I spoke to at retention never dealt with an APFT related separation...they claim to have never seen one. One thing the retention sgt told me, unless you were a fuck up.

I took her advice and went to speak to my CO again. He pretty much treated it as if he would be making an exception and that he had ""no reason to do so."" He said he would consult with another officer but that his mind is pretty much made up. 

I am not fighting the reasons for the separations, prior service will more then likely be refused from re-enlistment. Therefore, going into the IIR would be beneficial for when that time comes, which will not be long if granted.

I'm currently writing a story and I have a part where a unit is trapped by their enemy. This would be Iraq and one of the soldiers needs to call on the radio for reinforcements but I'm not sure how he is suppose to say that. I did a google search but could find anything so I thought maybe some service men and women would be willing to help.

1359988021.0,17v82o,Resigning commission to enlist 18X?,TristanRecord,9,4,17,"Sob story time: Some years ago a buddy of mine convinced me to join ROTC

Fast forward to the Reserve, not to mention my unit probably won't ever send me because of budget tightfistedness. Over the last few years I have figured out what I want out of the Army, and it's Special Forces. I love rucking, running, shooting, studying the couple of languages I speak, I'm in the top 5 PT score in the battalion (beating a couple former Ranger/SF guys we have milling around); My unit's never going to deploy again, and gotten nothing. I would apply for SFAS as an officer

I talked to a couple of recruiters and they were really elusive about whether or not I could resign my commission and enlist. One said I could, but you can't go to SFAS as an E-5"" which sounds like complete garbage. I am completely willing to go to OSUT, Airborne, WLC, pre-SFAS, start right over from the beginning as a private if that's the way it is.

Does anyone have the straight scoop? It's not like I'm resigning my commission to be a pussy and get out

I'm considering joining again

Is this the wrong reason to join? I've been told if someone does x years in the reserves he then has the obligation to be called back at any time within the next few years. I don't trust recruiters and I'd like to get the straight answer from you all.  

I don't have issues with asthma and I'm athletic enough. But I don't want to lie about it again and I would plan on admitting I lied if asked.  Would this disqualify me in any way?
