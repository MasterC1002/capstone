Last night

It had happened before

We talked for a while, it made her seem more attractive to other guys. He grumbled a bit, and I was surprised when he didn't disagree. But as nice as it was to catch up with him, his woe-is-me attitude annoyed me.

His phone rang, and was hanging out with me.

Who'd have thought it

She let my brother have it, for his messages, everything. Fortunately, he actually stood up for himself, and told her flat out that he wanted to be more than friends.

She gave him a shocked look. ""But we've always been friends! I don't want to lose that!""

He looked about to break and apologize

I asked her when my brother's birthday was. She couldn't tell me. I asked her how old he was. She made a guess

She couldn't answer anything about him. Not what his favorite books were

I stared at her

Pursuing Masculinity for its own sake is a trap and here is why and how I finally realized it:

Iv been bodybuilding for about seven years now. In that time iv gained approximately 10 pounds a year and am starting to get bodybuilder proportions at 225 pounds at six ft. I lift weights for myself

Anyway my family routinely shits on me for my bodybuilding:

Why do I need to do it? What am I trying to prove? Its a waste of time and money. Women are not attracted to muscular men

At every point in this argument it is clear that the usefulness of something is based on the female opinion of it. Nobody cares that bodybuilding makes me happy

When women have fun: go to clubs, Glitter paint each nail individual, they get encouragement

However when men entertain themselves:watch porn, play video games they are immediately shat on.: Lol neck beard why do you stop doing X and get laid?

Don't define yourself by how useful you are to women

1373229522.0,1htjda,Last night I went undercover,somedickcream,308,98,72,"**The skinny**: One of the girls I used to orbit back in high-school (5 years ago) texted me to set up a meet to ""catch up"". She will be referred as **A** from now on. Our relationship was textbook beta orbiter with some harmless sexual *incidents* (I was/am reasonably good looking).

At first I ignored it, skinny torso with a gut (lol), bad posture, cankles, hipster with a arrogant attitude.

**So I had this idea. Go in as the guy she's expecting - hopeless blue piller, see the hamster in a live performance and write a report. So this is how it went...**

I arrived at the time and place she chose. She was not yet there. She was 30 minutes late with no heads up.

 (*TRP advice: your time is valuable. There are legitimate reasons for being late

 She didn't even aknowledge the fact that she was late. Given my blue pill persona

(*TRP advice: even if she gives notice/apologises you should still playfully call her out

The night began with some light supplicating in the normal blue pill fashion.Then :tryhard jokes, no touching, taking a lot and fast, with all the fixins (bad posture, no eye contact, excessive smiling, agreeing with everything she says etc). 

Even after all of that she still throws some shit tests my way. 

**Me**: People that read on the bus are just trying to show off (their tablet) and the ones with books are just trying to look smart. Posers

**A**: I read on the bus...

(**Op Comment: She's doesn't even take the bus

**Me**: Yeah, but the people that I was talking about read crap like Twilight.

**A**: Twilight is not that bad.

**Me**: Yeah the movies are okay.

(*Op Comment: shit test failed as hard as possible: qualifying + explaining myself + backtracking*)

After more of the same she started taking about relationships.

**A**: I've been really bad.

**Me**: What do you mean?

**A**: I've sort of  cheated on my boyfriend.

(*Op Comment - this would be the third one she cheated on -  that I know of* )

**Me**: With whom? how did it happen ?

**A**: &lt;giggles&gt; with one of his friends

**Me**: So this happened just once ?

**A**: &lt;giggles&gt; Not really. 

**A**: We're not married or anything.. I just don't know what I want right now.

**Me**: Yeah I remember...

**A**: Come on ! &lt;smiles&gt; You know you were the special one.

(* Op Comment: I forgot how good of a manipulator she was* )

The discussion went in the same hamsterific direction, making sure to laugh in a crass disrespectful way every three sentences. Apparently when they first had sex this guy started thrusting in  really quick short bursts, so she *had to put her face into the pillow so he wouldn't see her laughing*. Charming.

Even with the determination test everything out

**Me**: Is it ok if we go ?

**A**: Sure.

**Me**: We can  continue some other time if you want to.

**A** : Can't you stay 10 more minutes ? I could drive you home

(*Op comment: Even after all this crap

**Me**: I could stay a little bit longer I guess....

So she drives me home (even though I lived 10 minutes on foot from the bar). The car is small (BMW Z4 - manual gearbox) I'm 6'2 and athletic. So every time she puts in 3rd gear she touches my leg

**Me**: So what did you want to talk about?

**A**: I wanted to ask If you wanted to come to my parents' lodge next weekend. 

**Me**: Oh? what did you have in mind ? 

**A**: &lt;touching my leg&gt; You'll have to come and find out. 

**Me**: Don't you have a boyfriend? (*Op comment: saying this one made me nauseous* )

**A**: Haha. It's a party

**Me** Haha no

**A**: I'll text you the details soon. Byee

**Me**: Bye.


So there it is. As blue pill as my stomach allowed me



I am considering going to the party and pulling a complete 180. I have no interest in A

I might edit this post with updates from her texts. I may write a field report on the party weekend if TRP is interested.

1374676586.0,1iyhjd,Nobel prizewinner explains red pill,Guurzak,253,59,93,"Here's an excerpt from ""Surely you're joking

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Eventually I told them that I was struck by something: ""I'm fairly intelligent, mineral guys, important businessmen, and so forth ­­ and all the time they're  buying the girls drinks, and they get nothin' for it!"" (By this time I had decided that  nobody else was getting anything out of all those drinks either.) ""How is it possible,"" I asked, ""that an 'intelligent' guy can be such a goddamn fool when he gets into a bar?"" The master said, so that hereafter you can get something from a girl in a bar like this. But  before I give you the lessons

I say, ""How the hell are they gonna do it?"" The master continued: ""Now you must do exactly as we tell you. Tomorrow night  you should sit some distance from Gloria in the bar, and when she gives you a sign, all  you have to do is walk by.""

""Yes, sure enough, there's some guy sitting with her, and  after a little while longer the guy's happy and Gloria gives me a wink. I get up and  nonchalantly saunter by. Just as I'm passing, Gloria turns around and says in a real 

friendly and bright voice, Dick! When did you get back into town? Where have you been?"" At this moment the guy turns around to see who this ""Dick"" is, and I can see in  his eyes something I understand completely, since I have been in that position so often  myself.First look: ""Oh­oh, competition coming up. He's gonna take her away from me  after I bought her a drink! What's gonna happen?"" Next look: ""No, it's just a casual friend. They seem to know each other from some 

time back."" I could see all this. I could read it on his face. I knew exactly what he was going through. Gloria turns to him and says, Dick Feynman."" Next look: ""I know what I'll do; I'll be kind to this guy so that she'll like me  more.""

Jim turns to me and says

""Fine!"" I say. ""What'll ya have?""

""Whatever she's having.""

""Bartender

So it was easy; there was nothing to it. That night after the bar closed I went again  over to the master and Gloria's motel. They were laughing and smiling, ""I'm absolutely convinced that you two know exactly what  you're talking about. Now, what about the lessons?""

""OK, or especially a cheapskate. As long as the girl knows the guy's motives so well, it's easy to steer him in the direction she wants him to go. ""Therefore,"" he continued, ""under no circumstances be a gentleman! You must disrespect the girls. Furthermore, the very first rule is, don't buy a girl anything ­­ not  even a package of cigarettes ­­ until you've asked her if she'll sleep with you, and that she's not lying.""

""Uh. . . you mean. . . you don't. . . uh. . . you just ask them?""

""OK, and it may be hard for you to be  so blunt. So you might buy her one thing ­­ just one little something ­­ before you ask. But on the other hand, it will only make it more difficult."" Well, someone only has to give me the principle, and I get the idea. All during the  next day I built up my psychology differently: I adopted the attitude that those bar girls are all bitches, that they aren't worth anything, and all they're in there for is to get you to  buy them a drink, and so on. I learned it till it was automatic. Then that night I was ready to try it out. 

I go into the bar as usual, Dick! Wait'll you see the girl I got tonight! She had to go change  her clothes, but she's coming right back.""

""Yeah, unimpressed, and I sit at another table to watch the show. My friend's girl comes in just as the show starts, and I'm thinking, ""I don't give a damn how pretty she is; all she's doing is getting him to buy her drinks, and she's going to give him  nothing!""After the first act my friend says, ""Hey, this is a good friend of mine

I say ""Hi"" and keep looking at the show. A few moments later Ann says to me

I think to myself, ""I can see fine from here."" A little while later a lieutenant from the military base nearby comes in, dressed in  a nice uniform. It isn't long, before we notice that Ann is sitting over on the other side of the bar with the lieutenant! Later that evening I'm sitting at the bar, Ann is dancing with the lieutenant, and  when the lieutenant's back is toward me and she's facing me, she smiles very pleasantly to me. I think again, and then I smile back at her

A few minutes later she's not with the lieutenant any more, obvious voice, ""I'd like to go for a  walk. Does anybody want to go for a walk with me?""
I think to myself, or you won't get anywhere. There comes a time when you have to go  along."" So I say coolly, ""I'll walk with you."" So we go out. 

We walk down the street a few blocks and see a cafe, and go over to my place and eat them."" The idea sounds pretty good, so we go into the cafe and she orders three coffees and three sandwiches and I pay for them. As we're going out of the cafe, I think to myself, ""Something's wrong: too many  sandwiches!"" 

On the way to her motel she says, because a lieutenant is coming over. . .""

I think to myself, and I flunked. I bought her $1.10 worth of sandwiches, and hadn't asked her anything, and  now I know I'm gonna get nothing! I have to recover, if only for the pride of my teacher.""

I stop suddenly and I say to her

""Whaddya mean?""

'""You got me to buy these sandwiches

""Well

I called her bluff: ""Pay me back, I went back to the bar to report to the master. I explained everything, and told him I was sorry that I flunked, but I tried to recover. He said very calmly, ""It's OK, Dick; it's all right. Since you ended up not buying  her anything, she's gonna sleep with you tonight.""

""What?""

""That's right

""But she isn't even here! She's at her place with the lieutenant.­""

""It's all right."" Two o'clock comes around, here comes Ann, unning across Route 66 toward me. She puts her arm in mine, and says, ""Come on, let's go over to my place."" The master was right. So the lesson was terrific! 

When I was back at Cornell in the fall, and suddenly I got this idea:  ""Let's go to a bar and have a drink,"" I said. On the way to the bar I was working up nerve to try the master's lesson on an ordinary girl. After all, you don't feel so bad disrespecting a bar girl who's trying to get  you to buy her drinks ­­ but a nice, ordinary, Southern girl?  

We went into the bar, ""Listen, before I buy you a  drink, I want to know one thing: Will you sleep with me tonight?"" ""Yes."" So it worked even with an ordinary girl! But no matter how effective the lesson  was, I never really used it after that. I didn't enjoy doing it that way. But it was interesting to know that things worked much differently from how I was brought up.",Red Pill Example,False,t5_2ve1u,True

At the beginning it was very difficult, that could be just common sense.

Obviously 95% of the customers were women. My first thought was ""only crazy women ask to Tarot cards"" but after a few months I started to change my mind. What if the average women is just like this?

I got to know a lot about women problems and from the answers (it was some kind of instant message system

A common story, no attractive guy, no game, just beta neediness. She was happily married, but the relationship was boring and she ""missed"" something.

All the time the questions from her were the same. ""Is he looking for a relationship or just sex?"" I learned the right answer here was always ""he is only looking for sex at the begining

Just for fun

Women were never scared about this part, anal new experiences or lack of sexual protection.

Other common story was about a married woman with an ""internet boyfriend"". Dozens of cases, but just told them he has other potential woman waiting. One minute later they wanted to be with this guy only interested on a dirty fuck. Their questions were always why this internet guy disappeared from their virtual lives (bored of their romantic internet chats). Not a minimum doubt about infidelity.

They always wanted to cheat their partners

One of the scariest things were when they asked about the potential lover, you can tell this kind of stuff on Tarot and crazy people believe it). She is happy with the idea, and after that ask about one female friend from his husband. Is he chatting with her? Usually I worked on the husband's side, just telling they are just friends. But if I just mention he has some attraction because the girl is beautiful, but he will never do anything ever, as he is a faithful husband, the woman just got nuts: he was attracted to other women

I can tell a million histories about that period, confirmed by psychic assistance he was only interested in hard sex. No remorse at all.

There are a few key issues that pave the way to the Red Pill.  As humans are sexual beings

**1.  Many men have trouble finding physical and emotional intimacy**

* Men cannot obtain emotional support from each other as women do - society teaches us not to. We want a woman to open up to.

* Men cannot obtain sex as easily as women. Most guys like me consider some 90-95% of women their age to be attractive. But getting sex as a man requires much more work and effort (unless you're a model or Brad Pitt).

**2.  Men are given terrible advice to fix this**

* ""Just be yourself! Girls love that!"" Clearly this is wrong

* ""Treat every girl like she is special and she will reciprocate"" This abhorrent thought is imprinted on guys at a young age by society and their mothers

Many men in similar situations have realized this.  Western women are now empowered with being the 'gatekeepers' to sex and relationships. If a woman wants sex

# *This is why game exists. This is why men are taking the red pill.*

A few years from now you’re probably going to want to marry my son. Perhaps you already do; he’s kind of hot (if I’m allowed to notice) and his potential is quite obvious, and when he lets is hair grow long it’s thick and wavy. He has his father’s beautiful eyes, and my dimples look much better on him than they ever looked on me. Also, he’s in the military; he has finished his deployment and doesn’t expect to go overseas again, so he’s now preparing to start earning college credits. I don’t hover so I’m not certain, but he’s probably going to major in engineering. Or possibly actuarial science. He surfs, rides a motorcycle and a mountain bike, and respects him. Girls hit on him regularly.

I’ll be surprised if he ever marries though. You see, dating, working with, and probably sleeping with, the product of sixty years of American feminism. I’m pretty sure he won’t find many women worth considering for marriage.

How about we look at it from his perspective

Half of you have been raised without your fathers, your mothers, taught you their values by example. Not an auspicious start. Most of the rest of you were raised by fathers who knew damn well that if they displeased your mothers, they too could be kicked out of your lives according to your mothers’ whims. They knew full well who had the real power in the family; they quietly accepted that “mother knows best.”

You were raised in a culture that permits, but to demand more and to expect more. You were punished far less severely for your transgressions than were your male peers. Indeed your female peers egged you on to be even naughtier, and to be defiant about it. It’s Grrrl Power, after all! The boys of your acquaintance were expected to give in to your shenanigans and your shit tests, and those who didn’t were labelled “problem children” and medicated. Usually, a boy’s best bet was to shut up and grovel, and maybe win your approval. They weren’t allowed to go around offending the Special Snowflakes

You were raised in a Disney Princess Culture, at least through your twenties. Go to college. Establish a career. Don’t get married until your late twenties or early thirties, but DO NOT under any circumstances, repress your sexuality. Your foremothers fought hard for your right to be promiscuous with no consequences; don’t you dare let their efforts go to waste.

And since you’re not looking for a husband, you have plenty of time to ride the best cocks you can find – thanks to modern medicine, you can get pregnant after menopause if you want, so there’s no hurry. You are expected to waste your youth and your beauty on hot guys who treat you like shit, then give your leftovers to the guy you’ll promise to love, honor and cherish for the rest of your life. Wow! How lucky is he!

My son looks around and he sees bitchy, undisciplined women. (Yes, even in the military; they had to lower the standards so more women could “serve.”) He sees overweight women wearing unflattering clothes that display muffin tops and rolls of fat, who drool over his biceps while telling him that “looks shouldn’t matter.”

He sees slutty women who dress to attract men, yet have absolutely nothing of value to contribute to a relationship. He sees women who flirt with their hopeful, geeky JustFriends, juuuust barely enough to keep them on a string while simultaneously panting after Alpha Hotteies, then run crying back to those JustFriends after being pumped and dumped by said Hotties. “Oh, why can’t more men be nice like you?” (Answer: if they were, no woman would fuck them.)

Look around you

There’s something you should know about my son and his peers. They’re not gay, they’re not unambitious, and they’re not weak. They’ve merely figured you out. They know that you don’t give a rat’s ass about them, and that you see them as nothing but providers and fantasy sex objects. They are wise to the game and they’re done playing by your rules.

They have the same job titles as you and they take home the same pay, everything they own is yours, but nothing you own is theirs (except your debts) and you can walk away with cash and prizes, at any time, for any reason. Or for no reason at all.

They’re calling Bullshit.

A few years from now, and you’ll just know that they could be “doing so much better for themselves,” if only they would “Man Up.” You’ll shake your heads in wonder at their “immaturity,” or their “wasted potential.”  Here’s a little secret. Yes, a few men are immature or weak; they’ve had the masculinity abused or medicated out of them, mostly by their single mothers and grandmothers. But most of them?

They no longer give a rat’s ass about you.

That’s right. They don’t need to work hard and earn a good living. They have no intention of fathering and supporting any children, and they don’t want to finance the personal choices of “Empowered Women.”

Those Empowered Women can buy their own damn birth control. These men refuse to feed your Beast. And you, can’t cajole them or shame them into giving a shit. Men are dropping out, ladies. Chivalry has died of blunt force trauma, in a beatdown administered by Grrrl Power. Your mothers, your grandmothers, your schools, your family courts, have spent the last two generations telling men that the are unnecessary and unwelcome. And now they’re leaving.

This is the gift that feminism has given to you: Independence. Scary, potentially impoverished Independence. For yourselves and any children you may have. Most of you won’t blame feminism though; you’ll blame Male Privilege (which doesn’t exist.) You’ll blame The Patriarchy (which always gave women a better deal than it gave men.) You will stamp your feet, flip your hair, and blame anything except the single cultural force that has devoted itself to suppressing and controlling masculinity. And you’ll go home alone every night to your cats, your Facebook Friends, and your vibrators. I sure hope that’s what you want.

Here's a Glossary of Shaming Tactics

http://exposingfeminism.wordpress.com/shaming-tactics/

&gt;Why so much hate?

Charge of Irascibility (Code Red)

Discussion: The target is accused of having anger management issues.  Whatever negative emotions he has are assumed to be unjustifiable.  Examples:

“You’re bitter!”
“You need to get over your anger at women.”
“You are so negative!”
Response: Anger is a legitimate emotion in the face of injustice.   It is important to remember that passive acceptance of evil is not a virtue.

&gt;You need to get a hobby

Charge of Unattractiveness (Code Tan) – The Ugly Tan Charge

Discussion: The target is accused of having no romantic potential as far as women are concerned.  Examples:

“I bet you are fat and ugly.”
“You can’t get laid!”
“Creep!”
“Loser!”
“Have you thought about the problem being you?”
Response: This is another example of “circumstantial ad hominem.”  The target’s romantic potential ultimately does not reflect on the merit of his arguments.

&gt;I don't know why you feel so intimidated by strong women

Charge of Cowardice (Code Yellow)

Discussion: The target is accused of having an unjustifiable fear of interaction with women.  Examples:

“You need to get over your fear.”
“Step up and take a chance like a man!”
“You’re afraid of a strong woman!”
Response: It is important to remember that there is a difference between bravery and stupidity.  The only risks that reasonable people dare to take are calculated risks.  One weighs the likely costs and benefits of said risks.  As it is

&gt;I feel really sorry for you

Charge of Instability (Code White) – The White Padded Room Charge

Discussion: The target is accused of being emotionally or mentally unstable.  Examples:

“You’re unstable.”
“You have issues.”
“You need therapy.”
“Weirdo!”
Response: In response to this attack

I wanted to talk to you about objectification of women really quickly. It's upsetting because I love women and would hate to see anybody treat one like less than a person. But it seems feminists are doing a great job of this as of late.

Let's address the word object. Objects have no agency. They cannot act for themselves. They can only be acted upon. I pick up a coffee mug and put it in the dishwasher. It is an object and cannot put itself in the dishwasher.

Let's talk about agency

Feminists used to be pretty upset at the idea that anybody would objectify women. This was the concept that women have no agency

Well gosh that sounds terrible.

Feminism agrees! Women aren't objects. They should never be treated as such.

So feminism

Feminists keep telling me I'm disgusting

But feminists- *you* were the one who told me women are people and make grown up decisions for themselves! Are you saying that women are incapable of saying no?

I just don't get it. I'm trying to understand. Why would you deny women agency? 

I have never had sex with somebody who didn't want to have sex with me. I respected their wishes because they are people. They're people with personalities and *agency*.

But you criticise them saying they are objects- that they have no agency! That they are tricked and manipulated

How could that possibly be? If I am handsome and they are attracted

You're skeptical. You don't think I'm a doctor and millionaire. I'm betting you just decided reading this letter that you don't think you'd have sex with me. But.. if you made that decision.. as an adult person with agency...

...*why would you deny other women the right to make the same decision?*

Do you think most women are incapable of critical thought? Do you truly believe that if I lie about being a doctor that somehow absolves a woman of her right to choose

Feminists, we don't need some big bad woman-group telling the little woman she can't make decisions. That **objectification** seems like something we should push against. We should start a group that represents the interest of women.

Because feminism

1372695646.0,1hflxi,[Mod] A note about reddit and their policies. Please read.,redpillschool,168,32,80,"I'm sure a lot of you all noticed this weekend that the admin of reddit went on a banning rampage

I have contacted the reddit admin for clarification of what the rules moderators need to enforce to ensure we are in good standing. I'm sure nobody here is surprised when I say the admin were *not forthcoming* with any useful information

I messaged the admins:

&gt;Can you give me a definitive list of guidelines for moderating subs that can protect our users from potential shadowbans and protect us from possibly breaking the rules?

To which I got a curt and useless response: 

&gt;Don't break site rules. That's a pretty definitive list.

The site rules are here: http://www.reddit.com/rules/ 

A brief look over the rules are, no child porn, don't break the site.. and finally, this overly broad and impossible to understand rule:

* **Don't ask for votes or engage in vote manipulation.**

I was, so I responded to the admin with follow up questions, which have been unanswered as of this posting.

The main problem here is how much room they leave open for interpretation. We do not ""manipulate"" votes

* No-participation is entirely voluntary and was made-up by redditors
* No-participation does not guarantee that admin will see our posts as non-brigading.
* The nature of reddit is participation across multiple subs. At what point does user participation across multiple subs become ""manipulation"" and how responsible will we be held for the individuals' actions?
* If individuals decide to vote or comment in threads *because* they're linked here- or *in spite of* the link here
* Can the admin actually discern between participation and brigading? Is there a discrete difference?

It is clear that if this behavior was not desired

Making inconsistent rules that cannot be followed

If linking to other posts was discouraged

If brigading other threads was discouraged

If participation in other subs was discouraged


There you have it folks, just a precarious line to walk of not breaking ""our rules."" *Whatever they may be*.

Of course the moderators of multiple subreddits have already taken action - including our sub- of making rules like ""you must use NP links"" or off-sub linking is entirely against the rules. These are desperate pleas to be seen in a good light by the admin, or if the impending bans are coming no matter what we do. We are as mere mortals attempting to appease the gods.

It's obvious that moderators such as myself are set up for failure, of course, we don't have to enforce that. But you see, I have no goddamned clue.

To the reddit staff, we can only assume your tolerance of some subs and not of others shows your intention of controlling the message and is implicitly endorsing some views while attempting to silence others. If I'm wrong, please let me know.

In the mean time: my advice to the subscribers of /r/theredpill.

* Do not participate on any thread that is off our sub. Do not downvote

In some instances I can regret not having done what I should

To give a brief outline of me and how I got into it, let’s call her Bambi. She was a housemate, and although we kissed on many occasions, she had a BF (long-term, long-distance) and shut me down every time, but those are other stories. Bambi invited me to lunch a few months after I’d got a new place (already graduated by this point) and her new housemate was there, who we shall call Rose.

Now, and I was really interested in knowing how she did so, and what it was that she did. Fortunately, 22 years prior to this point, the stars had aligned and my genetic code meant that I was growing into a very good-looking chap, and she was attracted to me. We got on well over lunch and then continued to talk on other occasions. We exchanged numbers so that on occasions I could pick her brain into getting me into her agency and what she did etc. She gave me one of the bosses’ numbers and said I needed to ring for an interview, which I did. Rose and I both went to meet the boss (Tiffany). Tiffany was an ex-escort and ran the agency with her partner (also an ex-escort), direct, but I got through it. Tiffany rounds up the interview by saying, I can see that you’re very attractive

It wasn’t a formal or clinical incident, I honestly had no idea women could be that good in bed, it was a real japs-eye-opener for me. Now, I wasn’t normally like this, but at the time, and because she was so forward, I was able to have the balls to be forward back and more dominant with her. She enjoyed it

So, they either **have** that, or **had** that, so either way wanted something different. If you do what you always do (or what everyone else is doing) you will get what you have always got.

My work-phone blew up for the first few months due to being the new guy at the agency and (so I’ve been told 100+ times) for looking like Robert Pattinson. I was very busy and I saw a lot of women. I will talk about specifics in a FR sort of way (if there are questions)

* Be dominant in the bedroom. We men are solely responsible for this going either way. The woman you’re about to sleep with has probably had sex passionately, not permission – pull that hair, slap that ass, throw her on her back, get her legs up, etc.  You achieve more by doing what you want more than by waiting for it to be asked of you, always. (The very act of hiring an escort kind of suggests they’re prone to more outlandish acts

* A lot of women weren’t bothered for the sex. We (the male escorts) were hired to perform, and whatever concoctions the woman had run-up prior to us going to the event. (Women would get their groundwork set weeks or months before with out-calls so that it wasn’t weird for anyone to see them with a younger, attractive man; think *’Wedding Crashers’* where they plan who they are and how they know each other). In short; women dig status, and they will fabricate a part of that status if necessary to save face (is this hamstering? I think of it as unique to the situation/job). We were shown off, lusted after, and used to incite jealousy in the women and to make the men seem less-manly by proxy.

* As sex wasn’t the main goal most of the time (women can get sex anywhere) I did a lot of conversing, and very wealthy. Of those 90%, the majority were childless, and all of them were very used to getting what they wanted and being in-control. Typical strong business-orientated women, who had little time to forge (or maintain) proper relationships. A lot had husbands, and/or boyfriends, more were divorced. I scoped a lot of white lines where wedding rings should have been. I never asked

* Because they were rich, and independent they struggled finding anyone that would a) pass their shit tests and b) be more so than themselves – at the time I couldn’t understand why they wanted me when they were obviously used to going for whatever they wanted; something had knocked these women back. 

* This created extreme privilege (I actually have a story about the worst client ever that I may explain in the comments regarding this) that resulted in hyperinflation of their self-worth. They wanted to act, whose value only went up. This bothered them; they had played the rules of feminism to a tee but were still losing in the end to men, despite their efforts. Many never linked their self-worth with their actual-value (SMV).

I'm about to finish work so I can't continue until this evening as I'm going out straight from here. I'm no longer an escort and haven't been for a number of years. Just to confirm why I left the agency (and prove that TRP is more fact than fiction)

I saw her on a night out after having left my old job about three months prior (where I did nothing to act on her by the way). She could tell I was different, and she sensed it. We fucked that night and I kept on fucking her, eventually succumbing to oneitis, and I got it hard. She knew what I did for a living at the time because I told everyone at my old job that I was leaving to do it. **She never once complained about it**, but I figured, due to chivalry an' shit, that I should quit and focus on a proper relationship. I did, and alright with myself - I really questioned my actions on every level. Everyone has a story of being the bluest blue

Now I can see that because I a) stopped earning money, and this is another direct quote, ""I don't know why, and I can't give you an answer you'll be happy with but I..."", well, you know the rest there. I stand by how TRP has been the picture I've used to create the puzzle from the bits I had left over. Any questions, and I'll do my best to answer later.

1369965399.0,1fdme0,Married Man with 10 years of Red Pill,married_red,176,48,85,"Hello everyone. I’ve been reading posts here for a few weeks and wanted to introduce myself and start contributing. I’ve been with my wife for 10 years

I took the red pill about 10 years ago. Just before I met my wife. But back then it wasn’t called the red pill (I didn’t exactly know what it was called). I just knew that I had enough of the bullshit.

I dated a lot before I met my wife. I read most of the PUA material (that was available at the time) but honestly I learned most of what I know from trial and error. Trust me

By the time I met my wife I was angry. Angry at women and angry at the blue pill bullshit. (Although at the time there was no such term.) I had given up. I was done. And then an interesting thing happened: I met a woman who wasn’t a feminist. She even told me on our first date: “I’m not a feminist.”

I’ve had a great marriage and a great relationship for the last 10 years. No, in a concentrated format, you guys have access to all of this information that I had to learn the hard way. I’m sort of pissed about that. (Just kidding.) But seriously, this is some great information and you are on the right track.

However, and I sometimes see posts from married guys or men thinking about getting married that get “shot down” by the general consensus. There isn’t really a lot of good information from married guys on this forum. I hope to give another perspective.

I do think that it is possible to take the red pill and still get married. It is challenging. And I’ll never say it is for everyone. But I think this forum could use a bit more advice from a man who has played the game a lot and has a relatively successful marriage. And yes

Don’t worry: I hate feminists more than you do. My advice will not be “not all women are like that” bullshit or feminist garbage. I just want to genuinely help other married guys who might be taking the red pill for the first time. Or

I have a lot of dating and marriage experience and I’ve screwed up a lot of things. The funny thing is that nobody I talk to ever cares. People are so comfortable with their “blue pill” world view that my advice always fell on deaf ears. So I stopped giving advice. But then I came across this awesome subreddit and I realized that I might just be able to help somebody.

I really enjoy reading most of your posts. Keep up the good work and don’t let the feminists get you down. Maybe NAWALT is bullshit, but at least she isn’t a feminist. And that is a very important distinction and a perspective I hope to bring to these discussions.

But most importantly: I agree with the charter of this subreddit. The goal is to help men get laid and have successful relationships. If anything I’ve learned over the last 10 years (being with my wife) or 15 years dating in general helps someone get laid then it was worth it. Because despite what feminists think: I actually like women.

1374184277.0,1il86r,Why promiscuity devalues women and not men. Analysis of the double standard.,omen1078,170,42,62,"This seems to come up often enough around here for me to attempt to break this down.

First

Her being unable to “pair-bond” after “x” number of partners.   I don’t really buy into this


Her vagina getting stretched out.   Nonsense.  They are elastic.  My experience has not shown sluts to be any looser or tighter.

Men are afraid of being compared to past lovers.  This, most men outgrow it or are confident enough in themselves sexually not to give a shit.  

Let’s get to the real reason:  Female promiscuity is associated with low value traits. Her inability to gain commitment from the men she slept with in her past sends a red flag to the rest of us that she is probably not someone worth keeping around.  Just how women take their cues from other women on which men to find attractive

Once a woman sleeps with a man, because if he hadn’t, she wouldn't be fucking with him in the first place.   [Superman analogy]( http://youtu.be/k5Xl8UCjMQI?t=1m50s).

High quality women are able to get commitment.  Men lock them down by marrying them and/or committing to them because they value what she brings to their life.   These women have a very low turnover rate because men keep them in LTR’s.  As a result
  
Women who have consistently failed to gain commitment from men they sleep with will be assessed as lower value, insecurity, low intelligence, laziness, unladylike behavior, etc.  They are seen as unworthy of commitment and subsequently used for sex until they are bored or pushed to commit and dump them.   

So we can conclude that a high number of partners for a woman is associated with low value traits.  One only needs to look at the revolving door of men in an overweight or homely woman’s life to see this pattern.

Now, but eventually they will assume it is because he is lazy and un-hirable.

Men make this same subjective judgment based on a woman’s sexual past.  Everytime she slept with a man who didn’t end up committing

So

Because the man is the *employer* in the analogy.   Women assume a man who has rejected a high number of sexual partners (applicants), and to be hired by him will put her in a good position.

A high # of sexual partners for a man is associated with high value traits.  Women know this, wealthy men, etc. constantly have women fighting for their attention no matter how many women they have had in their life.  Promiscuity between the sexes is simply not comparable because they have opposite perceptive value.  

Tl;dr  Men are the gatekeepers to commitment

There is a beautiful woman who adores me sleeping in my bed right now. Ive never been in such good shape. 

Core redpill truths and their corollaries:

1. Women are attracted to confidence; No one is more confident than a narcissist.

2. Women are attracted to calm strength

3. Women are attracted to dominant men; Disagreeable

4. Women are attracted to men who embrace risk; Dangerous men

Dark triad traits make for the most attractive men. A high pitched voice and a soft weak body won`t do it. Sorry.

I fully acknowledge, in love, with women, professionally... The only people who dont like me are the feminists and the manginas. Why dont they love me too? Why dont they love TheRedPill? Because its very existence, and the successful nature of the men who frequent this little corner of the internet is proof positive that they are full of shit.

It pains these people to think that some of us are hard working, just be yourself and the right woman will fall in love with you, shes not sending nude barely legal pics to zionController right now. Take your blue pill and go to sleep :)

Im only here to tell you the truth. Nothing more. I hope all you  become so great at life that your mere presence makes you hated by all those who dont have the balls to /r/becomeaman .   

I realize a lot of my posts piss people off. No one was madder about me saying women shouldnt vote than my own woman when I told her I would support taking her voting privilege away. She says Im a jerk. Shes right. I ask her if she still loves me. She says unfortunately. I say then it doesnt really matter that Im a jerk then

It doesnt really matter how much hate this sub gets, redpillschool gets... Its normal for the sheep to dislike the birds of prey. 

Keep lifting, pursue your dreams. Remember that women are children and that they shouldnt vote. Good women do dishes and dont withold sex from their spouses. Unmarried women over 30 are pathetic, and no one will ever care about your problems if you are a man. Lift heavy things, become a strong man, disregard females and be in a perpetual state of reading and learning. Its up to you to make your world into something you find desirable. Good luck and God bless.

* Frame Control

Frame is everything! Never enter into anyone’s frame. Think of frame like a bubble surrounding a guy. Never enter someone’s bubble! Establish your own frame and stick by it. People will test your frame continuously both men and women. Stay congruent with your voice and body language. E.g. When a loud gorilla motherfucker tries to start shouting and being hyper. Everyone else starts become hyper too. Girls will jump in their seats. Guys will stop what they are doing. The loud fucker got what he wanted. Attention. Now everyone is watching him and everyone has entered into his frame. Don't do that! Stay in your frame. Don't become hyper or excited. Let the fucker do his thing. Do yours.

* Manage time 

Most people are lazy and unambitious assholes. They engage in meaningless banter and small talk. Why? So they can avoid facing the drudgery of their pathetic existence. I see this in workplaces all the time. Co-workers talking absolute nonsense. Friends calling you because they need company to go somewhere. Guys talking about sports. Women gossiping. Stop that shit! This is not bonding. These people will drop you like a hat when you leave your job or change schools. You are not going to live forever motherfucker. Every second your life is ending. 

* Be decisive

No one knows what the fuck is going on this rock flying through space

* Be congruent

Be congruent in what you speak and do. Women especially look for cues to see if a man is congruent in his thought and action. Beware

* State control

Master your internal state. You master your state by knowing what you want and then going after it without hesitation. Most people are clueless of what they want in life. Don’t be that guy. Be what you want and where you want to be and go after it. Have a PURPOSE. Repeat after me. I will have a PURPOSE to my existence. 

* Be genuine

Be a genuine guy. Don't be a fake motherfucker. You become fake by caring what others think of you. Stop that shit right now. Don't care what people say or think. You are who you want to be. You are on a path to GREATNESS. Trust yourself,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,t3_1ifnxq

If you look at it this way

TRP enrages feminists because basically it says **if you leave plenty of freedom-room to women

Let's see step by step:

1) In a pick-up, don't hover, don't chase her, just value drop, tease, make yourself a high value target etc. and let her chase you. If you look at it this way, this actually respects womens freedom much more than the usual average, clingy type beta pickup attempts.

2) TRP says the best way to protect yourself from false rape accusations is to never get into a situation when a women regrets having sex with you

3) Regret after sex typically comes from drunken sex. We rarely talk about it but I think the general opinion is that bedding piss drunk girls is something any moderately OK looking beta without any game can do, date game etc. etc. Again you can say that it is in a way a very deep respect for the ""ability to consent"", another key feminist term..

4) In a relationship, express that you have other options. This is nothing but being conscious and expressing your own freedom to choose.

5) In a relationship TRP recommends to be a aloof and distant. This actually leaves her plenty of breathing room - i. e. freedom.

6) This part can be misunderstandtable... TRP recommends that you don't tolerate certain behaviors in a relationship. But this does not mean you enforce them by aggression or push and force things on women they don't want. It just means you simply express that you don't want to have a relationship with cheaters or big toddlers throwing tantrums or women who are unable to show some basic respect

7) It is true that TRP has general opinions that don't rhyme with the full freedom of women - it tends to look down on career women, and foreveryoung cougars, it tends to have a traditional view, i.e. that really good women marry young and virgins or almost virgins, are sweet and submissive, and become great wives and moms. But it's not about using authoritarian methods force and punish others into doing something that is not good for them. Rather, TRP plain simply says it does not make women happy in the long run so wise women should choose the traditional path, they are up for a nasty surprise at 35 when all the 35 - 45 years old men simply use their own freedom to choose to ignore her and chase younger tail, and have a freedom to choose too

Let's analyze this potential hypergamy hamster.

&gt;We're both educated people. I have a degree in Engineering and he has a Masters in Linguistics. When we first got married (I was 28 and he was 24)

So they've moved up to a very comfortable life and he's happy with that. She's not. Solution? Work harder at her job and maybe pitch in more and take more financial responsibility? 

&gt;We started fighting when I asked him to change his career. 

Nope. He needs to do that. 

&gt;To be honest

Must be complicated and rather academicish. I hate when I can't explain my job to people...

&gt; He works at an agency teaching foreign immigrants English and gets about 40k per year. 

Oh. Well that wasn't so hard to explain. What is hard to explain is his paycheck.

&gt;I thought it was fine when he was 24 and just graduated

AKA: He's happy at the expense of my happiness of neverending consumerism.

&gt;Most people his age (with his education) make more money than that

But MARY'S HUSBAND MAKES MORE THAN YOU!!!!

&gt;We argued more when I discovered that I wasn't around (our work hours don't exactly overlap)

Keep in mind

&gt;I think it's a colossal waste of time

PULL MORE

&gt; kind of feel like people are laughing at us as title and salary wise

Dat hypergamy feels....

&gt;When I confront him about this... he just says that it isn't a big deal, but at the same time when people get into a rut it's ugly.

AKA: Work isn't everything unless you're the guy. Hamster wheel should be powering a city by now...

&gt; I'm considering getting counselling or pushing him to get counselling to break his addiction... I don't know. Doing 20-30 hours of something like video games seems so counterintuitive to me. 

Now it's an **addiction**. Dat hamster gonna hamst. What the fuck does miss perfect do in her free time? Notice how she fails to mention that.

&gt;I did ask friends about this and people have told me I'm being to high strung and that he does enough and to leave him alone. He is really good about doing all the housework and house related and stuff seeing as how I work 10-12 hours a day and he works 6-8.

So he seems to be pulling in his share (work + housework) despite his rabid ADDICTION. In fact

&gt;tl;dr My husband isn't living up to his full potential. I want him to do more with his **wife**[sic].

At the time of this post

So what we have here is a decently successful woman married to a man that makes less than her, if despite all the warnings you choose to marry, make sure you pull in more income.

I regularly read through the threads on here, for the most part. Sure there are trolls here and there, but it's one *report* click away from being taken care of. I highly enjoy the discourse here, as much as day one, if not moreso.

The only thing that actually lowers the quality of posts is people complaining about low quality of posts. I have always treated it as concern trolling

There are people who claim that we've changed direction

**Field Reports**

It has come to my attention that field reports are becoming a little overwhelming. It's good to report back about your experiences, feel free to start it yourself.

--------
**Videos**

Our general rule we've been using is no video links without a self-post with your analysis. We try to remove them when it happens, and so we don't remove it.

I have decided we're going to get more strict on this rule. If a moderator sees a direct video link, make a self-post and add it to your analysis.

------------
**Self-Post Links**

I've seen people adding self-posts with nothing in them but a single link. Don't do this. They will be removed on-sight.

------------
**No Participation**

Please remember that no participation is for your own protection. I will ban anybody caught following an NP link and participating

**Doxxing**

Recently we've had a few events with various users attempting or allegedly doxxing eachother or attemping to call out *real life rapists (tm)*. It's drama I don't care for.

It's friggin ridiculous, but some people used to lynch black people too, so at this point just assume people will be idiots and think it's their job to deliver justice.

Everybody has a different opinion, and they're not expected to toe any line. We judge them based on their contributions up until that point. Sometimes they'll say something somewhat ridiculous- but as an exception, not a rule. For the most part, they're solid thinkers and we want to be able to distinguish good solid theory from the noise. 

That's the reason they exist. Just wanted you all to know. It's one more method to help keep the signal high

I'm sick of hearing people say that sex in real life isn't like porn sex and that we shouldn't watch porn because it gives us unrealistic expectations for our sex lives. What a load of shit

Is this just another lie fabricated by feminists to absolve them from having to perform in the bedroom? Do blue-pill betas rock gently back and forth in the missionary position thinking they're sexually satisfying both themselves and their partner? How bad must most people's sex lives be for there to be a general consensus that 'real' sex isn't anything like porn sex?

Once a woman is secure in a relationship she will begin to yearn for beta security over alpha novelty. She will tell you she thinks you should quit staying out drinking with your buddies, she will like you more for it, promise!

The problem is that while she may indeed want these things from an economic [**'Marriage 2.0'** perspective](http://www.mgtowforums.com/forums/marriage-sucks/17123-marriage-2-0-clarification.html) as an intellectual being... As an emotional being she will still be driven by the same attractions she had when she met you. And if you no longer attract her... better have another girl lined up.

...

I've been with the same girl for about 4 months now, but show them to her in the hopes of increasing self-awareness.

A great example of this inability/unwillingness to see emotional desire comes from how she perceives *what she thinks now* versus *what she felt with me before*. Every day I tease her ruthlessly. She drops her jaw

Even though this happens on a daily basis, it is 'mean'.

There are tons of other examples of this I see with her

If you keep doing things in your relationship that demonstrate you have the higher SMV and are the one able to walk away easier - teasing, etc. - maintaining attraction won't be a problem.

Imagine two guys interacting with a girl.  One is a gentleman, it is simply part of who he is.

Right now one of the girls I'm seeing is also telling me about other guys that hit on her on campus. They are all nice to her and she texts them a bit and then comes to me, I say something nice to her and she falls head over heels for me.

But it got me thinking. So I came here start a ""Red Pill lifehack"" thread where we can list some items we have that make our sexual escapades easier or more efficient. 

I can list a few of my strictly home items:

* I have wet wipes

* Candles and tissues on my bedstand.

* Another ""because I live in Korea"" thing; I have tons of facial/body lotions I have accumulated (and don't really use) since they are given as gifts very often here (even to guys as Kguys use cosmetics). Most girls use these when they get out of the shower. I've gotten compliments that it was cool I had them there to use.

* I have a giant mirror headboard almost exactly like [this](http://www.chariotrv.com/media/images/photogallery/IMG_0247.jpg). This gets tons of shit test-like comments from girls

* Bottle of cheap vodka

* Best for last: I have this [exact school girl costume](http://i00.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/602820568/Free-Shipping-Sexy-3Pcs-Cosplay-Girl-School-Uniform-Adult-Costume-Set-Wholesale-Retail-Min-order-ISet.jpg) that I bought like 4 years ago for an ex-fwb. She always left it at my place so I ended up keeping it. I also kept the packaging, and I have ended up using it for the past 4 years with each new fwb or gf. I tell them I got it especially for them and it makes them horny as hell (and it's fun for me too). I have had girls seriously lose all self-control and beg me to let them wear the costume because they get so horny and they really lose themselves in the fantasy (pretty much almost every girl I have slept with has had a cosplay fantasy actually). I highly recommend investing in one and keeping it at your place in the original packaging (just say you bought it for them but don't present it as a gift, so you can keep it at your place). The one I bought was from [Gmarket](http://www.gmarket.co.kr) in Korea for only $25. I wash it and iron it before repackaging it each time~

I'm a 40ish dad 3 kids

I recently read your slave labor ""rant"" and I felt the need to tell you how insulted I was reading it and that the overwhelming situational result of divorce ends in financial difficulty for dad.  

I'm no deadbeat, living off the charity of family members because of crushing support obligations.  

It has taken me 7 years to return to financial normalcy bearing the financial encumbrance.  I lost everything in the divorce and had to rebuild from more than $50K in the hole.

I had to work day and night for years while also attending college.  It was excruciatingly difficult.  Not once did anyone ever feel sorry for me.  It was by sheer force of some sort of otherworldly will I can't believe I managed to possess

The thing is...  My ex said many of the things you say about your ex.  She claimed I was a drug addict, both very sad and disenchanted with unmet expectations.  The difference was - I was duty bound to the children to try and make it work and she was not.

She opportunistically used my guilt and sadness against me to crush me in the divorce and leave me in abject poverty.  Then with the struggles that I faced afterwards

In the end

Ex-husband fathers are not an automatic means for a financial perpetuity you can manipulate for the sole sake of financial gain.  The kids need us.  You destroying us out of greed and a need for revenge destroys them.  You're negative blogging about your ex hurts the kids.  It's completely immoral and selfish of you.  Shame on you. Even if the things you say are true

You think divorce is easy on us men?  For us it is life changing in a profoundly negative way.  The worst part of it all is, you are now free to seek out an additional income source from another hubby if you were so inclined.

1373727873.0,1i7x2w,How feminists fail to understand masculinity,Sheckless,130,34,41,"I am posting a comment I made on a blog. It was made in regards to some comments about masculinity made by one of the feminists over at thegoodmenproject.com that supposedly cares about mens issues:

In another thread she called conventional masculinity ass hatery. Going into detail she mentioned things such as being competetive, aggressive and strong as toxic masculinity and ass-hatery or something like that. The problem is all those are normal traits in a person with failry high testosterone levels. I am like that to a large degree although I have other traits as well. She and most feminist completely fail to understand such traits in a reasonable way.

Aggressive drive is interperated as anger motivated or ill intent. Which it most certainly is not. I use aggressive drive when I want to achieve something and when I focus. I use it when I spar in martial arts. And when I use it like that trying to knock out a friend I am sparing with I have no ill feelings towards him I only wish him well. This aggressive drive

Being stoic is also a positive masculine trait. Feminists think this means repressing emotions but it does not. It means being able to remain calm and composed AT THE SAME TIME as you are experiencing strong emotion. It means having a still center within a storm. It is related to the quality of an impartial observer that you develop through Buddhist meditation. It is about having equanimity. For me that is quite natural and to me it seems obvious when observing men that this is a strong tendency in most and more prevalent the more masculine they are in general. Women on the other hand (and more feminine men) tend more towards experiencing emotion in a way where they are fully outwardly embodying and expressing the emotion and sort of get caught in the emotion (being caught in the emotion is not meant by me as negative). When they look at masculine men (and more masculine women) they interperate what they see as repressing emotions because the men don`t get caught in the emotion like they do. They seem far to still and unexpressive. So something must be wrong. Because if a highly feminine person was still and unexpressive like that it would mean they held emotions in and tightened themselves up to remain composed because they are not able to do that any other way. So the misinterperation of male stoicism that feminism has and has spread to the rest of society stems from the projection of the experience of feminist women (and some feminine men) onto men.

The result of such projection of course is to try to feminize men as the logical conclusion is that these men holding back emotion must start to display evidence of processing emotion in a way these people find believable for them to be healthy. Which is precisely what feminism has done and what feminists continuosly do and what I constantly see in feminist men and it is exactly what happened to me. The result of a man that is naturally masculine trying to process emotion in a feminine way is that he becomes dysfunctional and weak. Actually becoming like a feminine person and living that successfully does not work. I tried for years and it only made me miserable.

Being competetive is not a negative trait either. It is a drive to achieve that has been responsible for much (most?) of human acomplishment. It is also fundamentally misunderstood by feminists. When men compete directly it is combined with a form of respect for the competitor and deference to whoever wins out at any given time that makes the competition also into a form of cooperation. All male groups form dominance hierarchies and these are based on respect for the skills that are deemed relevant and the personal strength (dominance) and leadership abilities of the men involved. Men constantly compete in these but they constantly form hierarchies based on the competition that leads to highly efficient cooperation. The competition drives the effort which in turn powers the effectiveness of the cooperation of the hierarchy.

Women struggle to undestand these dynamics because they themselves feel much more threatened by clear hierarchies and direct competition in their female groups. Both those lead to hostility and the break down of cooperation in all woman groups. Women don`t understand how content men can be with a position that is not “equal” and they don`t understand the willingess of men to seamlessly (mostly) swap position and status and to seemingly fight the other in competition without it being seen as hostile but just a “part of the game”

Dominance is not evil either. It basically means vying for leadership and authority and power. WHAT you do with that dominance is what makes it moral or immoral. You can combine the will to dominance with the intention of shaping that which you have dominion over for good for those close to you as well as your self, since the begining of time. And nothing fires up a mans energy, willpower and drive and willingness to sacrifice like when his quest for dominance is motivated by a higher purpose such as his women and children or a wider group of people or a divine power. The quest for dominance flows nicely with the competetive drive it is a brother of within the male hierarchical competetive cooperation structure.

I use it when I spar in martial arts. And when I use it like that trying to knock out a friend I am sparing with I have no ill feelings towards him I only wish him well. This aggressive drive if you see it as imoral gets not turned of but turned inward where it becomes depression and self loathing and anger towards oneself. It tends to reassert itself as passive aggressiveness and I belive is largely responsible for the snarkiness of feminist men. Once it does boil over and start turning itself outward again THEN it has ill intent.

Being stoic is also a positive masculine trait. Feminists think this means repressing emotions but it does not.

Womens groups cooperate overtly and punish outright direct competition and challenges but are full of indirect competition and challenges and have very clear hierarchies that are covered up and not made explicit or clear. So when feminists want cooperation what they want is feminine cooperation. That in turn means more feminisng of men and more shaping society ina one sided way to suit women

What is the Puerarchy you ask? Let’s look to Ian Ironwood for the answer:

&gt;The Puerarchy, of all people, points out): the tendency for young men to spend a decade or so getting drunk, high, laid, and wiped out from video game exhaustion and porn marathons instead of applying nose to grindstone, getting a college education that will allow them to support their future ex-wives.  It’s perplexing for feminists because it means the pool of “acceptable” men for marriage and procreation (and productive tax-paying to support the welfare state) is drying up.  It’s perplexing for conservatives in the Manosphere because the Puerarchy seems to be thumbing its nose as traditional Conservative values of hard work and ambition

1) Looks have no effect on a woman   
2) Changes her mind and says yes looks do matter if you are hitting on a woman
3) Hitting on women out of the blue is a bad strategy and doomed for failure. This includes bars.  
4) women don't like being hit on  
5)  ""Hi my name is ____"" is the WORST pickup line in the book   
6) The only way you can have any type of relationship is by befriending a woman first and then developing feelings for each other.   
7) the key to winning a woman's heart is speaking to a woman on a woman's terms. It's so simple!

They were both 6-7 (but too old for my tastes). Turns out they aren't from my city, but from a super conservative town south. A town you would never live in unless you were super conservative. We bail.

We switch venues to another patio bar. While walking Bill gets a text from a girl he's working hard to sleep with. He invites her to join us. At this time I get a text from some other friends looking to go out

After a few drinks I realize there are no girls to hit on, a hostess should always be smiling, let me see you smile."" She smiles. I flirt for awhile, my regular push-pull. She eats it up. After 5 minutes her boss comes over and gives her shit and tells her to get back to work. I laugh at her and go back to my friends.

20 minutes later, it works a treat) She laughed.

15 minutes later I'm back with my friends. We're talking about a local beach volleyball tournament. I make a joke about looking for my speedo. I get a text ""I'd like to see you in a speedo."" BOOM! It's on!

As we leave

My friends all work the next morning so they bail. I have no problem rolling solo

The next afternoon the Hostess texts, I'm go to XXX coffee shop to read the paper and sit in the sun, join me."" ""I'm running errands, give me an hour?"" 

She's good to her word and meets me in an hour. During our conversation I use my Sherlock Holmesesque deductive abilities to figure out she's 21. 

My initial thoughts went something like

What I say is

Her: Um yeah

me: I don't know

Her: Yes!

Me: I'll be the judge of that

For the rest of the conversation I maintained the frame that she was too young for me

We made plans to get together after she was done work that night (read: late night). She flakes. I scolded her and told her flaking was unacceptable. She asked how she can make it up to me. I gave her 3 options:

1. Come over now

2. Never flake again

3. Send sexy pics

She chose number 2.

Friday night I went to a local sports event. She texts and asks to get together. I tell her I'm at the game and that I'll text her later. 

Brief aside: I use Friday and Saturday nights to develop new plates. Sunday-Thursday is for harem girls. The Hostess didn't really qualify as either

The weather was shit. No one was out. So I decided to change my mind and contacted the Hostess. She's excited to hear from me. Tells me she'll come meet me. 20 minutes later she flakes.

This has been 3 flakes (2 too many). I write her off. She completely fell out of my interest. 

Saturday she texts me: I know how to make it up to you.

BOOM! Nude pic!

Suddenly I'm interested again.

I respond: Not bad

I'll fast forward a bit (this is already too long). We set up a time to meet Sunday evening. 

She comes over. I pour her some wine. She gets a bit tipsy. She then starts talking about all the sex she's had in the past. I quickly interrupt her and tell her I wasn't interested in the sex she's had in the past, what she means is you are going to have sex. Sure enough, within a few hours we're having sex. At one point she actually stops and says:

""Not bad for a 21 year old hey?""

Later, ""Why should I have to pay a higher price than the guys before me?"" After some hamstering she comes right out and says, ""now you wont chase me, because you've already had me.""

**The Lessons**

Approaching the girls at the first place warmed me up

Having another girl at my table likely worked as pre-selection

Young girls are attracted to an older guys experience. She ""bragged"" about past sex as a way to show that she too has experience. She just wasn't smart enough to understand experience isn't attractive to men.

Perceived disadvantages can be turned into advantages. Instead of thinking I was too old for her

Girls like to be chased. When they flake it could be because they want you to work harder. When she realized I wasn't interested in playing that game

Young girls are very fun to sleep with.

Bonus tip: When getting a girls number always hand her your phone with a blank contact screen. If she enters her full name she's interested. If she only enters her first name you haven't developed enough attraction/rapport.

A new trend I'm seeing is a lot of newbies here are wondering if they're applying the red pill properly in their lives. 

Now

Introducing /r/askTRP 

We are leaving the ask trp flair here because there will still be relevant questions to ask our main sub

* What do you think of this theory?
* Has anybody else noticed this trend?
* What's TRP's position on this or that?

However personalized questions will now be directed towards /r/askTRP such as:

* I had an argument last night with GF
* My GF is giving me trouble
* I ran into a weird shit test

As always, frustration, and other emotions. While most places try to temper the message by ensuring it's politically correct, we have no such compulsion.

So instead of removing personal questions

I don't usually do this but I'm going to break this shit down because of how much it pissed me off. 

First: the title.

&gt;Why are guys so bitter about dating?

Starts out with shaming language right out of the gate. 

Second: The OP goes to askwomen instead of askmen. Arrogantly assuming that either women know what's going on in men's heads better than men themselves

And what does the top post in the thread say?

&gt;Guys don't seem to have this. You can read on the ask men or the posts her about being a virgin. One really common phrase I've seen is feeling like a loser, especially a hot girlfriend, is a status symbol. It is a marker of success, and an important one at that. Having casual sex gets them a social status in many male social circles, and failing to do so can be stigmatized, but that's another discussion I don't want to go into. When they can't get a girlfriend, they feel like they've failed majorly in a important social status way.**

That's right

First: It shows women's downright refusal to empathize with (or even listen to) men.

Second: It shows the way women think about men. Women love to assume that men think the way they do. It's why feminists think that rape isn't about sex; it's about power (because women use sex to control men.) It's why feminists believe in rape culture (at least half of women have rape fantasies and assume men fantasize about raping women as much as women fantasize about being raped.) And it's the reason women accuse men of misogyny (because they think men hate women as much as women hate men.) and entitlement (while at the same time expecting special treatment because they're women)

That's right. To the denizens of askwomen

So I've probably read through this book about 20 times now. (It's that good) but anyway after being hooked on theredpill for some time I'm starting to see some connections between lessons in it and Game that might be helpful for you guys. 

All of you know what the [Rationalization Hamster](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/17xmry/acronym_and_glossary_thread/) is and how often women use it. Well what I'm really seeing here is a connection to women attempting to be ""noble."" As Dale Carnegie says in his book ""*The fact is that all people you meet have a high regard for themselves and like to be fine and unselfish in their own estimation.*"" So what I'm going to try to do here is redefine the hamster in a way that makes it more understandable and allow you to use it to your advantage when picking up women. 

The idea for this hit me when I was reading [a post by zioncontroller about 5 days ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1h7hrn/seducing_a_woman_with_a_bf_quick_pointers/carmoj5?context=3) and I had a viola! moment after hearing a TED talk I made a post about earlier today. This is something that zioncontroller (advanced PUA) has been using to his advantage already

So here it goes. The link at the top is a summary of chapter 10 of Carengie's book

To understand this, dodge a bullet and run away). This is possible because in fact because EVERYONE is at least a little selfish, but almost nobody(especially women) want to appear that way. 

This is advanced game. To use this you need to be able to size up the circumstances you are in, so let me give you a few examples.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Example 1) Zioncontroller's field report is a great example of it. (see the link above)

A girl with a boyfriend texts zioncontroller giving him a clear IOI. She then goes into talking about relationship problems. 
**At this point the hamster wheel is already spinning
So what does zioncontroller do? He uses that to his advantage by appealing to her nobler motive and giving her a valid excuse to come sleep with him.

&gt;Me: Is he with another woman? Maybe you just need to releive your frustrations on someone

The move was flawless really. In one sentence he fed her hamster a logical motive (my boyfriend might already be cheating on me so why can't I do the same?) and got her thinking about sex as a revenge tactic rather than the dirty shameless cheating that it really is. 

---------------------------------------------------------
Example 2) [RSD Julien on making women fall psychotically in love with you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFuMi36mg2k)

This scrawny guy has some serious game

&gt;*She'll come up to me and be like ""I can't believe you fucking pulled that shit on me

His response:

&gt;*You know what

What he does is guide the hamster's output. Instead of it putting the blame on him

----------------------------------------------------------
Example 3) [Scottishredpill with women getting mad about him not buying drinks](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1cf803/asshole_nice_guy_in_disguise/)

&gt;After a beer and a smoke, and a brunette called Sara sat at the bar next to me. I had seen them close down 3 approaches and decided to practice getting closed down.

I'll get to why the above part is important in a second. Here's the story summarized:

So two girls start racking up a tab and then get furious when he doesn't pay for their drinks (that they ordered on their own tab). SRP does the sensible thing and walks away from the hysterical women. About 30 minutes later the calmer (who is wearing a large wedding ring) of the two runs into him while out for a smoke and asks for him to sit next to her. They talk for a bit and then here's where he drops the Nobler Motive bomb:

&gt;She (Sara, smile, I change the subject and then her hamster goes into overdrive.
&gt;She (Sara, and we continue like nothing happened. Oh, except Sara will not let go of my hand.

You can see her hamster spinning here. At this point she saw SRP's value and wanted him herself, by giving her eye contact and a smilet, it let her hamster come to that actualization she was his type. Leap for joy, she was his type.  From there the hamster told her that she should totally fuck him since her friend isn't going to get it anyway, and after all, according to him she is better than her single friend so she must be a good person if he likes her.

The end result:

&gt;After the club I walk her back to her hotel and give into her seductive ways.

------------------------------------------------------

There you have it. The hamster is really just her internal conscious looking for a noble motive to get down and dirty. I especially like RSD Julien's motive ""this is my chance to live the fantasy fairy tale! I have to go for it."" And in that TED talk earlier today: ""Why don't women leave abusive mates before things get really bad?"" A: Because they think they can help them (Which is a nobler motive generated by the hamster

For the rest of the night my Iced Tea rarely even hits halfway and we banter back and forth about the other patrons. One of her tables has a bunch of HOO-RAH Marines who are randomly barking and just being obnoxious. One of them ends up puking so she stops by and we bullshit some about that. She sits down at one point and we talk about the fights as I had mentioned that's the main reason I was here

**SH**: Big fight tonight. I'm pumped for Silva.  

**Plate**: My ex-boyfriend did that whole cage fighting thing

**SH**: Well

**Plate**: Definitely!!





A few hours go by of more back and forth and she sits down to chat yet again. This is where it gets interesting. A very *nice* fella sits down next to her

**Plate**: Nope.  

**SH**: &lt;Laughs&gt; That felt like ""I don't really have a boyfriend

**Plate**: Exactly. My ex cheated on me and we broke up a while back and just recently stopped talking so I am really just interested in focusing on me

**SH**: Plate

This is what is known as a ""confirmation text"" and it is very important to avoid the reset. If you're not familiar with a reset it boils down to this. Women, and in real life from orbiters and men hitting on them constantly. My theory is that the reset is a coping mechanism. These broads are getting sensory overload with all this attention, so their attention spans are very short and they tend to ""reset"" on what seems like a daily basis. Anything that happened in the past is nearly forgotten and they tend to only live in the moment. By sending the confirmation text I carve out a little bit of territory in her brain, set the expectation for my next escalation, and avoid the reset. Now, I'm in my early 30's and have some ""old school"" strategies that work for me. I despise using strictly text to communicate with women because my sense of humor is extremely deadpan, sarcastic, but do whatever works for you. Basically

Just got a reply a few hours ago.

**Plate**: Mkay. Lol your added SH! (:  

A ""Lol"", I really wish she didn't have a bunch of visible tattoos. When are these dames going to learn you don't put bumper stickers on a Ferrari? Ahh well, what are ya gonna do?


**Conclusion**: It doesn't matter if she has a boyfriend, learn to hold your space well and pace conversations. Escalate properly and never listen to what a woman says, *watch* how she says it. She even caught me starting at her tits a few times and I would just make eye contact and smile. None of it matters, none of it. Your attraction level dictates the vast majority of how any encounter plays out and it is your job to steer it in the desired direction. Non-verbal cues are *huge* and I could tell based on her randomly checking me out, constantly sitting down to chat, and general friendly attitude that she was interested.

&gt; The primary conceptual domains[...]promulgated to represent the various phases of human courtship include Attraction, despite the growing success of this industry, few psychologists and social scientists have taken a critical look as to whether or not the various concepts and teachings promoted by this Community can be substantiated by empirical psychological research.

**Community Literature on Human Courtship Strategies**: 

Introduces background info on *The Mystery Method* and *The Game* for readers who are uninitiated. 

&gt; Markovik situates his teachings within a Darwinian framework, 1990) noting that, “while unimaginably sophisticated and complicated, [we] are nonetheless an out-of-date model. Put simply, nature has not designed [us] for the world in which [we] live.

**Parental Investment Theory and Conflict between the Sexes**

Basically, women are much ""choosier"" than men when it comes to mating and sex. 

Here's the most important part of the paper:

&gt;In the absence of a clear understanding of the biological bases of such differences, 1993), often coined “the war of the sexes”, can be a significant cause of conflict and ultimately failure to find and maintain a lasting long-term relationship. However, as we will argue, this conflict is not inevitable. The knowledge of our evolved sexual strategies gives us significant capability to improve interactions between the sexes by choosing appropriate actions and deactivating others – ultimately reducing conflict between men and women. In this respect, we argue that when properly and ethically understood, despite its provocative label and origins outside of academia

**The Three Phases of Human Courtship: Attraction

The paper then goes on to discuss these three parts of sexual strategy. For attraction

&gt;A typical example of [a direct type] of opener might be: *Hi, and wanted to say hello*[...]Research has shown that expressions of social dominance (Sadalla et al.1987), social risk-taking (Wilke, Hutchinson, Todd, and Kruger, 2006), 2005; Kelly and Dunbar

&gt;Indirect openers often include apparently random queries such as, psychological research has shown that many of these qualities, when well-presented, can often be quite attractive...

This section is very long, and a good sense of humor as among the most desirable"". Research has also shown that humor is VERY important and universally appealing. In fact:

&gt;Humor has been further argued to be an honest signal of other cognitive abilities, 2008; Kaufman, Kozbelt, Bromley, and Miller, 2007)[...]Bale, Morrison, generosity

The paper next discusses ""pre-selection"" (social proof

&gt;The phenomenon where females will copy or imitate the preferences of other females for a particular male mate has been documented in a wide variety of species, 2008; Dugatkin, 1992; Freed-Brown and White, 2009).[...]Place et al. (2010) found an increase in male attractiveness among women who observed mutually interested romantic couples, while Jones, DeBruine, Little, and Feinberg (2007) found a similar effect if other women were observed smiling at male faces; a reverse effect was found for unsmiling faces (Jones et al. 2007) or uninterested romantic couples (Place et al.

For Comfort &amp; Trust:

Lots of research listed in the text...

&gt;Indeed, for a review)[...]From a study of courtship behavior in singles’ bars, Moore (1985) found that incidental touching, prolonged eye contact, swaying the upper body towards a prospective romantic interest while talking, and a number of other tactical devices designed to attract attention were frequently implemented.

For Seduction:

This part isn't as interesting but it basically discusses how all humans inherently seek closeness, etc...and then states that the PUA philosophy recognizes this and tailors itself to satisfy this need in females.

TL;DR This is a very recent and current study that seriously takes a look at seduction strategy and whether or not it is anecdotal or backed up by real research/empirical data. Blue pillers can say NAWALT as much as they want

The purpose of this thread is to start a discussion on a subject that I deem extremely important to everyone within this community.

Disclaimer: *By no means is anything in this post fact. Below I have compiled tidbits that I have picked up from various unscientific blogs &amp; posts (however often citing scientific articles themselves) that I have compiled in order to facilitate discussion within this subject.*

**Lets start by discussing the basics**

* Testosterone is produced during sleep
* Testosterone levels of the present day are due to your behavior and consumption patterns of the previous day and prior
* Increased testosterone levels ellevates mood/energy levels and eliminates mental fog
* It has been considered that if you are not achieving morning wood you may have sub-optimal testosterone levels
* Consumption of specific items contain estrogen derivates and will have negative effects on your testosterone levels
* Cortisol levels negatively affect testosterone levels. Manage stress through any method that works for you. Consider meditation.

**Simple methods of increasing testosterone**

* 8-9+ hours of sleep a night to produce the next day's necessary testosterone levels
* Sex
* Diet: Increased fats &amp; cholesterol intake has been shown to raise testosterone levels
* Avoid pesticides as they contain estrogen derivates. Eat organic. Wash fruits/vegetables thoroughly.
* Fitness: Lift. Consider short &amp;amp; heavy sets. Sprints. Intensity.
* Supplements; **Core**: Vitamin D3, Magnesium, Vitamin B6), Vitamin C, Creatine. **Debatable**: Testosterone supplement/steroid use are largely up for debate. Consider making a large lifestyle change prior to evaluating alternative help or shortcuts.
* Limit alcohol intake. Specifically

**Lets squash some misconceptions and answer some questions**

* What exactly is testosterone?
* Why is testosterone so important for us?
* Is melatonin use a testosterone inhibitor?
* Does extensive caffeine use affect testosterone levels?
* Zinc? Creatine? Other natural supplements? Do these help?
* Does refraining from masturbation and/or porn use have initial positive effects but result in a flatlining testosterone level going forward?
* Does enhanced testosterone alleviate erectile disfunction?
* Are unnatural supplements/[steroid use for increasing testosterone levels that bad](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1ftlrc/testosterone_is_the_red_pill_how_steroids_changed/)? Have you used them?
* What exactly can a doctor do for you that you are unable to simply do on your own?
* What exactly is a solid level of testosterone to achieve? How is it measured?
* [How does one get tested? Should you](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1eqeec/day_1_a_practical_mans_journal_of_the_effects_of/)? How accurate are the tests? Have you been tested?

Avril had a Skater boyfriend who she met in High School. Avril loved Skater boy in high school. But now that she was graduating college it become apparent that skater boy lacked real career prospects so she began mentally distancing herself from him. Avril began going to clubs and flirting dudes.

My girlfriend was complaining to me about how controlling Skater boy was and how he insisted on reading her texts. She then nervously asked if I would ever do that. I said no I would never **ask** to read your messages. She was happy and the conversation ended with her telling me how she was so happy that our relationship is built on trust.

You see I would never ask to see those messages because given enough notice she would just delete whatever is incriminating. Anyway

I got a piece of paper wrote out her messages with times and dates. I later cross referenced those times and dates with when we were together

Here is the unsurprising thing I found out. You know how our generation, and telling her friends how hot her boss is. You could be snuggling in bed, going on a hike, watching a movie, introducing her to your mom, it doesn't matter. Woman are constantly seeking sexual gratification in one way or another via texts.

I think of attention as a form of currency - something to be distributed for gain or when merited. Betas devalue their own currency by constantly printing more whenever the demand arises. Alpha currency

When a female demands attention from the beta, thus giving the currency *value*. This is why a woman will pursue validation from an alpha because their attention has value and isnt mass produced.

When a woman seeks attention and goes to a beta she may gain temporary satisfaction, it is much more satisfying than when a beta provides the same amount of attention.

A ""not bad"" and a thumbs-up from an alpha has far greater value than all the flowers and gifts from a beta could ever have. This is why when a woman finds an alpha

I grab my usual cocktail, and turn to the girl on my left (blonde, 7 face, 9 body, Pam) and ask if it is her.  She seems... a little drunk.  She shakes her head and says no.  I turn to the girl on my right (black hair, 8), ask her and she responds no.  I put the jacket to the side and ask the girl on my right if she has a light.  She hands me a cheap bic lighter in a Stoli case, and accuse her of stealing it while putting it into my pocket.

We chat for a little while, and I eventually let her go into my jeans pocket to get it, telling not to cop a feel, which she does anyway.  She heads in, saying she was hanging out with 2 friends, and I should join them.  I tell her I might later.

During my conversation with the Brazilian, I asked if the red jacket belonged to her.  She said it was, and I reply:

""That's a shame

She laughs and informs me it's worth more than a fiver

When the Brazilian leaves, two blondes and brunette.  I can tell that the brunette is a lesbian from her hair style, clothes and posture, and dating one of the blondes.

I find out the two original blondes are out celebrating Pam's birthday.  When I ask how old she is

Everyone is clearly shocked, while the three other women give me into trouble for guess so bad.  I tell them I am terrible at guessing peoples age.  They tell me I should apologize and I agree that I probably should, and change the subject.

I find out the lesbian is from a city I stayed in for 7 years, she is gay, and the blonde is her lover, and that they are out having a drink because she starts her chemo the following Monday.  She is pretty good natured about it, and we tell terrible cancer jokes.

During this, she does the same and also gives me the middle finger.

I'm bantering with the lesbian about where I am from (Mars) what I do for living (wash ducks).

""I bet your single""

""It's complicated""

""Ha

""I meet this crazy 18 year old here the other night

""scottishredpill

""Don't be nosy""

At this point Pam interrupts

""I'm 38 today""

""That's nice

I turn to the lesbian and try to continue chatting.

""Why did you say 45?""

""Because that's the age I thought you were""

Her pal ""scottishredpill

""I'm not being mean

Pam ""Buy me a drink""

""No""

""But it's my birthday!""

""I know

""You're an asshole""

""We just meet

She gives me the finger and starts staggering around the table, and she is falling into me.  I put my hands up to catch her, and she falls onto my lap and badly kisses me.  When we stop kissing:

""Well that's the least smoothest way someone has kissed me

""Shut up

""No""

""You're an asshole""

""So you have said""

""Buy me a drink""

""No""

""Fuck you""

""Ha, it makes you look fat""

I push her off my lap

I managed to make a deal with her and her pal about drinks, expensive bourbon cocktails out of them.

After about an hour

When introducing themselves to me, saying ""Too slow"" I laugh and reply ""Nice, I haven't had that done to me since I was 12"".

He then proceeds to say ""I like your style"" I thank him, first time was funny, now you're just being a fucking childish asshole""  He looks shocked, and apologizes and shakes my hand properly.

They start running some game, ""He isn't your boyfriend, your boyfriend is a fire fighter?  Who is he then?  Oh, a birthday snog, him?!  He said you looked 45!  What an asshole, you look 25!  You go to the gym, wow, Pam insists I get a glass and enjoy two drinks on them.

We have now been chatting with the two AMOGs for about an hour.  Her pal has taken a liking to one of them, but you know, gotta keep the stats up), and head into the bar.

I head into the bar

Pam is sitting with one of them

""Pam broke out her smooth move and fell onto him""

""She really needs to work on that

The AMOG chatting to her pal calls me a few names.  And I sit between him and the lesbians.

I chat to them all for awhile, he looked a little confused and replied ""Yea, well, I'm taking him under my wing""

20 minutes pass

Once they have left the smoking area

""Ha, teaching my mate how to pull the ladies like a man""

""That is true, she was fucking wrecked, there was no chance her mate was going to let her leave with anyone; she isn't from here.  Your mate and I gave her some birthday kisses.  But, lets look at it this way; I got them to buy me two cocktails and refused to get them any.  You got them 4 cocktails, that's about £30-40, and the champagne, the cheapest bottle in here is £50.

I was at a dinner party and the conversation soon turned to politics a Russian national pastime. As soon as it did all of the women shut up and let the men speak. When one of the American women tried to offer her opinion she was shamed into silence by the men and some of the women. I asked later why women were culturaly disallowed from speaking with men on politics at the dinner table. The response I got was 'In Russia women don't speak while men are discussing politics."" 

Back then I thought this was backward and misogynistic. But ten years of talking with women later iv come around and thing this is a wonderful cultural norm.

With regard to abstract

* Women are not abstract thinkers. You know the logic question where you have to rotate the letter L in a three dimensional space? Women suck at that shit. So when an argument is very abstract a women will **always** make the conversation about her. Once the conversation is about her favorite subject she will speech vomit about herself drowning out anything interesting you or your friends have to say.

* Women are emotional thinkers. Given enough time in a conversation a women will always use an emotional appeal

* Women are protected by betas and white knights. Women have no problem throwing insults at you when the argument gets a little complex or doesn't have enough feels to understand. But iif you throw some shit back at her. The white knight will start valienly defending and all intellectualism will be torpedoed. What you will be left with is retarded baboon yelling which is not that enjoyable.

* It is very difficult for a women to understand the distinction between a heated political discussion and personal argument. Now my friends and I can argue all day about any host of issues and we often disagree. But in the end we will be friends and we'll  grill some steaks together. For a women this distinction is impossible to make. If two of her friends are having heated discourse she will break up the argument. Its kind of what little dogs do when people have loud discussions they start barking because the feel excitement in the air. Shell say cant we all just get along? Or politics is dreadful businesses we should talk about something else. Tadaa!

Bonus: One of the reasons why America has become for less intellectual in the past 60 years is because women began being included in all sorts of things. Thus destroying all available space for intellectual discourse.

Time and again, the excuse factor creeps out.  I learned that when I sit around and entertain this excuse factor, I start to get angry and wonder why things aren't easier.  This makes for a pitiful night and ends up with me jerking off to porn.  I sat around and allowed the default conclusion to take place.  Losing.

In my progression, I will get blown out in front of several people and they will laugh at me for my failed attempt, but since I have pushed past the excuse factor by constantly approaching and thoroughly enjoying myself, I am able to withstand their attempt to degrade my social status.  Many times, I will literally stay my ground, make direct eye contact with the girl, make a big smile, I stood my ground and didn't move.  The worst thing for anyone trying to degrade someones progress is the realization that your opponent is never going to stop no matter how hard you stomp on their skull.  I felt like an oil fire.  No matter how much water you pour on it

Everything women do in the western world is in one way or another tied in with victim mentality and resource extraction.  They will ALWAYS be a victim.  School teacher fucks an 8 year old boy and gets pregnant? SHE WAS COERCED.  You find out your not the father?  SHE WAS RAPED/COERCED/CONDOM BROKE/DENIAL/DENIAL.  

Shit like this is no longer a shock to me.  It actually bothers me when people post articles on this sub about crazy shit some woman did.  ""GIRL DOES SOME GIRLY SHIT AND RUINS A MANS LIFE.""  Seriously, shit throwing, insecure creature that will take as much as you let them, and will only fuck people that don't put up with their shit.'  Yes, some are cool, nice, and feminine

Embrace your faults and stop living the victims life.  That's literally what a woman does her whole life.

Women are gatekeepers of sex, men who sell emotions for cheap or no sex are betas / niceguys / whiteknights. Women train and punish men by withholding sex, although usually not admit it and rationalize it away, i.e. ""not in the mood today"". Men train and punish women by withholding emotions, some do it consciously, most will similarly not admit it and rationalize it away ""tired today, not in the mood to talk

So for example hover beta friend behavior is not simply signalling low own SMV vs. signalling that you consider hers high

The reason women shame sluts is that they reduce the price of sex: they do not ask emotional commitment for it. Thus it is much harder for normal women to ask it.

Similarly betas make ""I love you"" and ""you are so wonderful"" cheap. She doesn't even fuck them and yet they say things a normal man would only say after the tenth time of having sex in an LTR. Or wedding night or whatever. They make romantic emotions cheap. They make women think they don't have to earn romantic commitment. With sex of course. 

This means it is not good for you if 90% of men are beta. They are selling romantic commitment and emotions all too cheap. This makes it harder for you to demand lots of good sex for it. It's the same problem as decent women have with sluts

&gt;She likes me to stop talking to a lot of girls, which I'm fine with, but she doesn't want to do the same. She wants to do what she wants to do, and if im going to stop her, shes going to resent me for it. As far as that goes, **I honestly don't mind too much, but it's definitely created some problems.**

Emphasis mine. Yeah

&gt;Anyways, her ex boyfriend who was at the time in jail called her, saying he needed a place to stay for a night and that he had no where to go until he went to rehab for his drug use.

Incoming alpha

&gt;She had been with this guy for 2 years, and he broke her heart because he kept doing drugs and screwing up their lives and eventually stole from her just to continue to do drugs. They went on and off for a year or so, he went to jail, and then I came into her life.

But he didn't, and N came back to her house to stay the night again. It's now Saturday, and he'll be staying the night tonight as well as tomorrow night too.

1376043150.0,1k0nlm,FR: Weekend in the UK,BirdieBurgler,94,29,31,"So as a long time lurker I have been feeling like it’s time to contribute for some time and recently I have been seeing a lot of requests for field reports. Since discovering TRP I have had countless experiences that would serve as good examples here

The following story contains several examples of sexual strategy

Short background: I am 34, putting them on pedestals and taking their irrational shit seriously. I had 2 (very) long term relationships previously, got fucked over on both of them. My fault. More details on request.

So here is the story of my cousins wedding weekend in the UK (I live in a different European country).

Thursday night: Dinner with the whole family after which I decide to have a pint on my lonesome in a pub before heading back to the hotel. It’s nearly closing time

Cute barmaid peeks her head out from behind the drinks shelf thingy in the middle of the bar. I ask her jokingly if she is trying to hide from me and she says she is closing in 5, not been in the city that long. We chat for a bit I’m joking around eventually I say ‘Jenny, you are my one and only friend in this city, Come with me to the centre, I want to see if this bar is still there that I went to last time’. She says she is going to the centre anyways, some mates are coming to pick her up in a minute, I should come along.

Her friends show up and I chill with them while she goes to get changed. Most of them work in the same pub. I get on with them immediately, won’t shut up about her. He’s not sure what I’m doing there and is worried because I am the centre of attention at this point.

On the way to the club I am chatting with everyone, but create a situation in which it seems like we go way back and have our own world, separately from the group, even though I’ve only known her 15 minutes longer. I tease her, steal a ciggie from her mouth, give her a piggy back ride at one point. I Alternate between focusing on her intensely and then not at all, talking to her friends.

In the queue to the club some gel-haired suit starts chatting up Jenny, escalating quite early and whatnot. I start talking to the Italian girls in front of us (I can hold a conversation in Italian), I make funny mistakes on purpose and have them all in stitches. They find it endearing.

In the club, staying beside her at the bar, paying her full attention, while I’m dancing with her mates and the Italian girls. I’m talking to everyone, meeting everyone in the club, including bar staff. Carlos is my biggest fan and follows me like a puppy.  I can see Jenny constantly peeking over at me, bored with gel-hair talking at her. Now and then I grin or wink at her.

 Around 3am I figure I’m ready to leave. I go over to the bar, and walk out of the club with her over my shoulder. Probably one of the coolest things I have ever done. We take a cab back to hers and bang until about 6am.

Friday: Wedding rehearsal in the afternoon. After the rehearsal, you should go talk to her’. Lol. One step ahead of you dad… Most of my cousins are trying to flirt with her after a few drinks. She is gagging for my attention all night and giving me free drinks. One cousin asks me about it and I say we met last night. ‘really? Did you try to get with her?’ heh.

Bar gets packed as it’s Friday. There is a group of girls there, kind of classy. I am at the bar next to the group. I turn to the one next to me (ugly one), catch her looking at me and do a sort of surprised looking away - looking back - looking at the ceiling - purposefully awkward thing with wide eyes, then crack up and give her a high five.

They ask me where I’m from, massive eyes, nice dimples, 25, let’s call her Amanda. She’s the designated driver, so isn’t drinking. I talk to her, escalate a bit, even though she doesn’t. As soon as we get outside

Back inside her friends are blatantly jealous and start making fun of me, applaud, bow and keep talking to Amanda. Jenny is giving me the evils at this point and even refuses to serve me. I get Amanda to buy me a drink. The girls want to go clubbing, but I really don’t want a hangover for the wedding. They manage to convince me, but I say that at exactly 2:30 I’m leaving.

They actually take me to a casino type place. It’s members only and the bouncer is refusing to let me in. They beg and plead with him. I tell the girls to calm down. I look at the bouncer, it’s just to show them that I am ready to spend money. Inside I Isolate Amanda in a couch area and we make out. She says it’s such a shame that I don’t live there and have to leave so early, ‘stay longer, we can go back to mine after’. She asks me when was the last time I got laid. ‘Yesterday’. ‘Oh. Wait, it was that barmaid from the bar wasn’t it?’ ‘Yup’ I can see her spirit sink. ‘Ohh nooooo’ she says and looks at me like I just farted in her handbag. ‘She was so hooooooot!’ Insecurities… I just grin and say nothing. She is now going crazy over me. She keeps trying to convince me to stay, but at precisely 2:30 I say my goodbyes and leave. 

She texted me for days after this and I know I can call her next time I’m in her city for a hookup.

As you can imagine, and he will refuses to engage with them beyond speaking when spoken to and gives me daggers when I try and include him in a group banter.  He also gives me an earful the next day for putting him into that position.  Over the past 2 years I have been feeding him some seduction things.  No routines, just the basics: say hi, make eye contact, be sure to touch, ask her out.  No interest, at all.  He knows what I am like, he still refuses to listen.  I also explained some RP to him, but ""it seems cultish and too much to read"".  **sigh**

So I suggest a hobby

He invites a mutual girl friend (Jill), and won't say no if he made a move.  The exact phrase was ""She tired of guys like her ex (lesser alpha) and wants a nice guy"" 

Awesome(ish, but he needs it!) :D

I subtle quiz him about her

""Dude

""No""

""She won't say no

""No""

""Ok

""No

""Man, trust me""

""No""

""If you don't

""No she won't""

""Yes she will.  I promise you

He refuses, bar, club or casino, what could go wrong.

We hit a Brazilian steakhouse for dinner, etc.  They sit next to each other, and we start to eat.

Straight away he starts rolling out the beta game, gives me into trouble every times I tease her (I know I probably shouldn't, but it's so ingrained I do it naturally).  Aaaand she starts doing it to me, ""scottishredpill, you have to try this"" sticking her fork in my face, checking I had plenty of wine.  So, not going according to plan.

Our waitress is a petite Brazilian girl, tell her it was great and she tells me ""It was made with love"" while making that stupid heart hand thing).  This seems to annoy Jill, and she starts flirting more, stealing food off my plate, trying to grab my hand, staring.  When the waitress leaves us at one point, she snaps ""Try not to fuck her in the toilet""  During all of this

We leave the restaurant (I got a pleasant surprise when the bill came and discovered the waitress has ""forgotten"" to add a few of my drinks, I suggest to my friend to be a gentlemen and offer her his arm.  We had shared 4 bottle of wine, she was wearing high heels and the we were walking up a fairly steep hill.  He of course said no, and said don't be an asshole and offer to do it.

We grab a table in the bar, and she sits next to me.  &gt;.&lt;  First topic of conversation, how one of our other friends told them I was a filthy bastard in bed.  Cue 30 mins of being quizzed about my sex life, during which I have to move her hand off my thigh, and my friend looks more and more uncomfortable.  I try to bail everytime I see some cute girls, but she either stops me (""They look like tarts"" ""Well, duh"") or follows me.

We head to the casino, walking between us.  I give my friend a ""I told you so look"" and he shrugs.

On arriving to the casino, I see them playing blackjack together, so I decide to join a different table.  A few hours later my friend turns up at my table, sans Jill.  Turns out she left, and he didn't go with her, or even walked her out the place. **faceplam**

A month later I caught up with him:

We broke up a few times, but I always caved and came running back to her. Then last summer, she finally broke up with me. We promised to stay friends (bad idea) and for a while we did. It became a true 'Alpha pays, Beta plays' scenario where she was with a few guys while I still gave her rides and helped her with school and all sorts of shit. What was I thinking?

Then after she'd had her fun, but my mother of all people was the one who told me that I deserved more respect than I'd ever get from a girl like her. So I said no and my ex flipped a shit. I promptly responded by asking one of her friends on a date, which was successful. I told my ex that I was entirely done with her. A few months later she started hitting me up again and going to the same parties as me, and I would act condescending and aloof towards her. At the end of last semester, she asked me for help the night before a final. I countered with the suggestion that she should come over and have sex with me instead. **And she fucking did.** 

I didn't understand what the fuck had happened at first. But it's all here. I demonstrated I had other options. I stopped putting her on a pedestal. I found my confidence and self-respect. Oh, as much as the poor bastard probably deserves it. Also, I just don't need the hassle.

(For those of you who haven't seen the movie, spoilers ahead.)

When the movie starts Phil is toxicly arrogant

Then he starts to repeat Groundhog Day and the first thing he does is to go on a quest of wish fulfillment (seducing Nancy

Then he gets bored of that and starts to try and seduce Rita (whom he fell in love with at the start of the movie)

This is where he becomes depressed and suicidal

After this Phil starts to try and be a better person (tries save the life of the old hobo, takes up ice sculpting, starts to educate him self).

For this he is rewarded with the admiration of those around him. And is bought by Rita at a bachelors auction. On the following date he is much different from the man that was trying to seduce Rita and so in the end he gets the girl of his dreams. (It's a 90's movie so of course it's got true love in it)

******
To me the film can be viewed as an allegory for the transformation many RP men have gone trough. We are weak and have less than stellar personalities. We do what doesn't work and become frustrated and jaded by it. Take the red pill/hit rock bottom and start to focus on things that matter to us. This change in behavior changes how we perceive our selfs and so how others do as well. Witch in turn changes the quality of our lives and our relationships with people.

1366166040.0,1ci9lr,Don't marry young girls with crazy mothers.,GeneralUnderpants,88,27,67,"I've told my story in a few other places

5 1/2 years ago I met a very attractive woman on the internet. We video chatted for a while and talked on the phone. Sometimes her mom would get on the phone and ask me for relationship advice, but her daughter (the one I was hooking up with) seemed perfectly normal. We ended up dating for a while and then living together for about 6 months before getting married. I was in the military at the time so we moved around quite a bit. After a while she started hinting that she wanted me to get out of the military once my contract was up. I really didn't want to do this, but she kept going on and on about it more and more over time. When the time came I said screw it and got out to make her happy. I got a civilian job and worked there for about a year and 1/2. Our relationship was still great at this point even though I gave up my career for her. I quit my civilian job because she wanted to get some experience in the degree she was working on getting. She found a job paying decent money in that field and I quit my job to stay at home with our child. 

A few months go by and I think it hit her that she didn't really want any of this life that she had. Something happened that sucked the maturity out of her and she decided it was party time. For about 2 months she was going to clubs and house parties 2-3 times per week and sometimes wouldn't come home for a day or two. I begged and pleaded for this nonsense to stop and explained that it was ruining our marriage and family. After 2 months I finally convinced her to stop

Sadly, and move back in with her a few states away. She tried to talk me into it, but I refused to give up a stable income, home, food, etc for our family just so she could go live with mommy. Fast forward to 1 1/2 months ago my wife comes home with a box of things saying that she just quit her job and is taking our child and dog and leaving in two days. I was speechless. I literally had no words because just not long before she swore up and down if she left she wouldn't screw me over. 

I was so busy trying to figure out what to do that I didn't notice until after she was gone that she had drained the bank account (right after we had gotten our tax return) and taken almost anything in the house worth selling. She even took many of my things that I had long before I even knew her. 

After she left I have the Sheriff beating on my door delivering protection orders claiming that I'm armed

Bring on the lashings. I deserve them. I will even swallow my pride and say she has slapped me around numerous times because she was mad at me for trying to stop her from doing whatever she wanted even though it was ruining our family. I was a pussy. Never again.

TL;DR Don't marry young girls with crazy moms. No matter what people say women DO turn out like their mothers sooner or later.

&gt;I have read half your book thro', e.g. you say ""women are more sympathetic than men"".

&gt;**Now if I were to write a book out of my experience

&gt;Now look at my experience of men. A statesman, out of sympathy with me, remodels his whole life and policy - learns a science the driest, the most technical, the most difficult, that of administration, as far as it concerns the lives of men - not, in the field from stirring experience

&gt;I only mention three whose whole lives were remodeled by sympathy for me. But I could mention very many others...

&gt;**I have never found one woman who altered her life by one iota for me or my opinions.**

&gt;Now just look at the degree in which women have sympathy - as far as my experience is concerned. And my experience of women is almost as large as Europe. And it is so intimate too. I have lived and slept in the same bed with English Countesses and Prussian Bauerinnen. No [other woman] has ever had charge of women of the different creeds that I have had. No woman has excited ""passions"" among women more than I have. Yet I leave no school behind me. **My doctrines have taken no hold among women...and I attribute this to a want of sympathy.**

&gt;It makes me mad, would consult one for my work.

&gt;I do believe I am ""like a man

&gt;**Women crave *for being loved*, for they cannot remember your affairs long enough to do so...They cannot state a fact accurately to another, nor can that other attend to it accurately enough for it to become information. Now is not all this the result of want of sympathy?

All of my conscious thoughts have been shaped by what the media/movies portray as the ""ideal"" man and trying to mould myself into that image. The only success (I feel) I have had in my life has been through substance abuse. And by what I mean by that

Reflecting on that is pretty eye opening. The only time I feel like I have been successful in my life was through a means I didn't control internally. When I just followed my natural instincts through substance abuse I always improved my personal situation; until following the obvious conclusion of repeating my behavior of what was rewarding, and bringing it all crashing down on my head. 

All of this feels like it's connected to me because of this: Sober, movies, and women's advice) and fucking. hates. myself.
Substance abusing me lowers my inhibitions and makes it easier to follow instincts, risk taking ( obviously the higher I get the worse this behavior gets ), doing whatever I feel like doing and seeing immediate effects. Translating into an immediate rise in my social position, literally more vag and sexual opportunities than I knew what to do with (not for lack of trying), deeper bonds with everyone I met, and just a general increase in feeling of self worth. This is just my personal experience and is obviously possibly skewed by said substances.

This thread and all of the reading material I have absorbed the last few days, sense of self worth, and just general self worth are curable. I think they are directly attributable to my quest of self actualization, by which I mean thinking that I can become the man I want to be by following everything I have absorbed consciously and subconsciously through whatever means by a feminist society. 

I have come to the realization (thanks to this community) that I have been struggling and fighting myself into the deepest, hasn't, and never will work for me. Instead this community has opened my eyes to the fact that the only way for me to realize self actualization as a man, is to make myself into the man I want to be. I've always believed that hard work, perseverance, and educating myself will get me the life I want. I have only just come to the conclusion that I have been aiming for the wrong thing my entire life.

Thank you to the people selfless enough to spend a portion of your time in the world trying to educate other people. I feel like if I had never found this community and the material provided I would spend the rest of my life in a darker and darker spiral fighting my own instincts to be a man because that is what society wants.

I felt the need to post this as the easiest way of shifting through all the emotions and thoughts that I have uncovered the last few days. I feel like writing this has helped me put some of my thoughts and goals in concrete instead of just floating around in my head.

Now... now I know she was hamstering. Because I found out two years ago that she had actually been cheating on me towards the end. She slept with three other guys - one of whom was actually my ""friend"" - before breaking it off with me, she was twenty and wanted cock. 

Once I realized that this girl, deceptive, and cruel, I began to wonder about other girls I dated. The more I dug around, the more I realized that I'd never been in a relationship where I truly knew the other person. I never realized how women's minds work and every time I thought I was dating my ""best friend"", I was being played a fool. It was hard, but it made me stronger. I began working out, taking care of *myself* for *myself* instead of sitting around waiting for some woman to come into my life.

My confusion is where do I go from here? What do I do with this knowledge? Because right now

I see this as a spectrum. On one end you have totally blue pill guys who are blissfully ignorant, and when faced with the evidence or consequences of her true ways, can incredibly fool themselves into thinking it was his fault or that she didn't actually do anything wrong or that they're still better off with her. Just read /r/relationships for non-stop examples of this. These guys, in some ways, are lucky.

On the other end of the spectrum are totally red pill guys, to girls. The ones who don't get fooled into thinking that this girl is different. The ones with the skill to get enough sex that they don't get dependent on one, and can drop her once she stops adding value to his life. These guys are the most lucky. They see reality, and they use it to their advantage.

And in the middle of the spectrum is limbo, even if you wanted to (which you never will). But you haven't really *accepted* it. And you continue making the mistake of thinking 'this girl is different' when you go on a date with a girl who has the innocent face and says exactly what she thinks you want to hear. (Every time, I've been proven wrong to get swept up in the good girl show they put on for me.) And you don't have the skill and confidence to seduce enough women. So in this limbo, neither do you get blissful ignorance nor do you get to be the beneficiary of reality which includes, among many other things, her propensity to cheat. Hence the bitter aftertaste of the red pill.

I quickly find out what the point of the writing was. They had lost a bet another barman and had to see who was the first to get someone to kiss it. Amateur hour

First set is 2 girls and 2 guys, giving them a quick hi and lock eyes with girl on my left. This doesn't go well, as it turns out one of the guys may have been dating her, and was fairly annoyed.

I return to my table

I go straight to asking for her to kiss my arm

Steve starts asking about what I said, we can wing each other.

He agrees

- why rejection doesn't matter
- the importance of outcome independence
- the concept of situational openers
- not being the first to buy a drink
- if he doesn't open

He seemed to get most of it, a touch taller then me, skin tight white jumper with black short shorts on, standing with a fairly overweight guy.

I suggest them

I come in at a slightly bad angle

""Ouch man"" grabbing both their arms as they turn towards me ""You just stood on my foot!""

Steve is laughing

We spot a 2 set,  probably after 4-5 mins, exit and return. He listens to me and then leaves the booth.

He walks over, I'm sure he is about to bail and return when he seems to catch is never and opens them.

It looks like it is going well, slowly lifting his wallet out.

I get up from the booth and approach. As I do, and turning to the girls

""Hi guys

""Eeer

""It's me

""Ahhh, I turn her round so her back is towards her and my friend.

""Jill

I turn to the bar maid ""Hey pal! Isn't this a surprise!""

She stops, it's been too long!"" she says, stepping towards me.

I stop towards her and we hug.  When we break, she doesn't break eye contact.

""How have you been?"" I ask

""Good

""Aw

""I live round the corner

""Well

Giggles ""It's really good to see you""

We hug again and this time we kiss.

""Well

She giggles

""Ok

We kiss again and she leaves.

I turn back to my friend, who is now talking to some guy. I return to out booth and resume drinking, Frank has vanished.

I look over at the booth the guy I told to get lost, probably on her way to the toilet.

I yell her name, and she actually skips over, smile getting bigger as she approaches.  She hops onto the seat next to me, puts her legs over mine and snuggles into me. I put my hand under her chin, and kiss her.

After we kiss

She giggles ""Maybe""

""Come home with me""  I repeat

""Ok, he would be annoyed if he seen this"" she says, looking back at here she came from.

""Ok, down the street outside &lt;bar name&gt;""

""Ok""

Steve returns, I share some more theory with him while we open random set. Steve has work in the morning, so he leaves and I head back into the bar. Frank is at our booth, talking to two guys. Turns out they are brothers, and are here on holiday. I leave him to it and open the group I had earlier told to fuck off.

The guy of the group tries to give me shit about telling them to fuck off, but there is a 4 set of 2 girls and 2 guys sitting on a wall.

I go out at least 4 nights a week, that's at least 1000 women a year, most sets are 2+.  I've been doing this for 2.5 years, and been red pill aware for about 6 months.

I've meet at least 2000 new women

I spent my early teens to my late twenties in numerous 4yrs+ relationships and was once married. I know how long term relationships can deteriorate and fail. Luckily

While this is not representative of every city or country in the world

1374965580.0,1j6p6a,"A ""Hamster"" primer",grubstake,78,22,15,"I've been seeing more and more posts that use ""hamster"" or ""hamstering"" broadly to define pretty much anything coming out of a woman's mouth.  It devalues the usefulness of the term.  Here's primer for those new here.

Hamster is short for the term rationalization hamster which is a tool used by both men and women to rectify cognitive dissonance.  Cognitive dissonance occurs when you have two conflicting perceptions

**PG Example of hamstering**

Here is a simple example of cognitive dissonance taken from an [old story](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Grapes): ""A fox sees some high-hanging grapes and wishes to eat them. When the fox is unable to think of a way to reach them

There are a number of ways that this applies to TRP.  I'll throw out a couple of the big ones.

**Hamstering to resolve subconscious desires and higher-conscious needs**

One is that women have two modes of thinking when it comes sex and their attraction to men. At the subconscious layer, confidence, dark triad, etc.  At their high conscious layer, women are attracted to the things that you generally hear them talk about - kindness, stability, etc.

When traits in a given male do not satisfy both her subconscious and conscious layers, she will find a way to rationalize that he is good for her.

**Hamstering to resolve slutty behavior**

Another TRP application is that Western women (and those slut-shaming cultures) will also hamster to rationalize their slutty behavior.  A common example is the mental hoops a woman will jump through when you invite her back to your place at the end of the night.  Her subconscious is totally DTF at this point.  Her high conscious is telling her that it's a bad idea though.  Her subconscious is going to usually win out

**On Nice Guys**

A common trope I continuously hear is that nice guys aren't really nice

Niceness need not be contrived to fail. I was a genuinely nice guy

And I let people take advantage of me. But this wasn't contrived niceness. It was naivety. I was taught from an early age, respect people and they'll respect you. What really happened was nobody respected me and everybody took advantage of me.

And I think that's why I dislike the recent reframe of the nice-guy problem. They're not typically disingenuous. They're simply misinformed. They can be as genuinely nice as anybody can be.

**On Confidence/Assholes**

I keep seeing here on the red pill this common trope. **""You don't have to be an asshole

So the argument is that you don't have to be an asshole to be confident. I disagree. Part of having good game (for men) is conveying (not explicitly) that you have options. The only way to do that is to send signals that you have options. These signals must act counter to what would be expected from somebody following the ""rules"" of our society. In other words, I must make offenses, albeit small enough ones to maintain attraction. 

Some examples:

* You text me

* I cancel dates 1/3 of the time.

* I make plans with multiple people and only go to the one that I'm most interested in that day.

* I won't buy you a birthday gift.

* I won't buy you drinks.

* You'll try to get me to open up

These are all not just confidence traits

And it drives women wild.

Enlightened women mention they like the combo of asshole and gentleman. I agree that's the most attractive way to go about life for a man. But don't forget

It's not enough to be confident. You must convey your value by showing you have options,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,theory,,t3_1c7khz

You all know this, the whole cheating story...so you may get it how this works

I was in my 2nd year of college, I liked that...getting drunk, hitting on girls, all that shit.

I got used to hit on girls all night, 1-2/month...I got more pussy after 2nd- 3rd dates. I did ok, better than many of my male friends, and was not about the look, I'm 5'8 tall, a bit skinny looking with small frame...but I didn't give a shit about anyone. I would get in a fight with 6'2"" guys even if I knew I would get my ass kicked(and I did, twice). 

Ok, big breasts...a good 7.5(others said was &gt;8). I decided to go for her.

I approached few girls before so I was in my state..I waited a few minutes to settle on the table and went after her, convinced her to dance, all that shit...and tried for the close with no luck. All that time she mentioned she has a 2 years boyfriend who loves, and I just said ""let's have a good time, feel the moment, it's your night"" and stuff like this. When dancing and things got a bit hotter, I tried kissing her few times, I managed to get her number.

A few days later I texted her something like ""I had a good time"", C&amp;F and she got hooked. Finally I said something: ""Maybe I'll run into you in the mall"" (she said she has some stuff to do there). She replied ""maybe, but you know, I have a bf"".

I knew when she would be there so I got there and texted her ""Where you are"". She responded...few minutes later

We talked about half an hour than we went outside the mall and went to a little park. Initially she said she needs to go home(only her rational thoughts)

I made some cold reading, I played my usual kiss close routine and even if she lightly resisted first time, second time she couldn't, she wanted it. The reaction was unexpected, her legs were shaking and she starred into my eyes saying 2 times ""why did you that? You shouldn't have done that!"" . I stayed few minutes with her, not talking much, she was weird, that I couldn't let her go.

The next 2-3 days I had no contact with her, but she also told that she never felt so much attraction for someone.That was her telling ""don't let me stop you"" ... Of course, we met again. We made out pretty heavily. She got so horny when we made out that she was moaning...

On the 3rd date she was accepting the affair, I had a fuck buddy I was banging pretty often and occasional sex with my ex...so for me it was just interesting, nothing emotional. Finally, she allowed me to put my hand in her pants and rub her pussy, after initial resistance and about 30 mins of make out...she was so wet. We were in a public place, on another park, at 10-12pm, but I didn't want to ruin everything. However

We took a cab and got to her apartment. Her room mate was not home. On the whole drive to her place I maintain the sexual state
On her place, my that time ex, after a break of 2 months). I started undress her roughly, remove her bra with no resistance and the last resistance was her panties. However, the panties were all wet, she was moaning and still hold her hands on them, so I won't take off... Well, I just put my cock inside her. Fuck

After we finished, What i have done"" almost crying. ""This was the one and only time"" and things like that. Guess what? 2 days after, she initiated the conversation again...my reply was ""Did you room-mate get back from home""..""no"", ""ok, i'm at you in 20 mins""...""Hmm...ok"". What's next you can figure yourself...lots of animal sex, cum in her mouth(she didn't make her bf a bj so far because she thought is disgusting....WTF? and she gets my cum all over her mouth saying that it tastes good...and women tell you should listen their words). After sex she admitted she was the best sex ever she had...I loved when she screams and uncontrollably shake his body when I fucked her hard.

After about 10 fucks I dumped her because I started to feel a bit attached and I didn't want that with a girl that cheated her bf in such way

She was crying, to meet, how much she thinks about me and so on. I never replied but she kept sending all those messages.

Another reason I was making this post is because I met up with her accidentally 2 weeks ago and we kept in contact a bit which made me remember all this. She was the same girl. She was still very attracted to me, she wanted to feel that fling again and started to flirt with me. However, I played beta(consciously), I said her I'm a good guy, that I don't appreciate what I did to her, basically I played the beta male game the 2 times we saw each other and talked.

Guess what? Her attraction got away...she even told me that: ""well, I haven't hard anything from her. 

The moral here: Even the most innocent looking, she's a keeper"" can surprise you pulling stuff like this. Begging me to fuck her hard, making bj and tasting my semen when she thought was disgusting and never done in her life (21 years old) even with her 2 years bf.......makes me think a lot about how women really are.

Today I discovered just how much they will edit your point to serve feminisms purpose.

I wish I could say I had a recording of the original interview

Here's a copy of my notes from the interview that I prepared/edited/used during the interview.

----------
Let's accept the premise that there is a level of crudeness in the tech industry, I have the same right to be offended that they do. Why aren't we seeing an equal number of men avoiding the tech industry?

***

First of all


**

Well let's ask the real questions

1. Do women feel unwelcome in the tech fields?
2. Are men purposefully causing women to feel unwelcome?

I think I'd like to address the second question first.

Let's say a woman decides to work in a coal mine. The first day she arrives she finds men in dirty clothes with dirty faces going down into the pits and 

doing hard strenuous labor. She may not prefer to get dirty- she might find that she can't wear her shoes of choice. She might hear men making jokes she 

finds offensive. She might find herself physically incapable of even completing the work.

But this isn't uniquely a female problem is it? I grew up in a christian home

perform the duties required. If I don't like getting dirty

So do I feel welcome? Well maybe I don't. But does that mean they're discriminating against me? Does that mean they should change how they work?

There's this myth going around that nobody should feel uncomfortable at work. I disagree. First day on the job

Obviously a good employer should ensure that employees are not mistreating other employees

I think one issue is that women over-estimate how comfortable men typically feel in new environments.

Whether it's a new job, for men it can be extremely uncomfortable until they are able to prove themselves to the group and make themselves a place. It can be daunting, and down right difficult. Often times I feel discouraged in my endeavors, like I should quit.. but I push on anyway- despite not necessarily feeling welcome.

And I think therein lies the problem. Women are offended because when they break into a primarily male group

That's how you become successful. It's not a boys club.

I couldn't understand how women could just stop loving men, as I slowly realised what I now know as Briffault’s Law. It was pure torture for me everytime I got dumped, I nearly killed myself the third time it happened, couldn't cope as reality became hell for me.

Luckily I no longer believe that I'll ever find the right one, I accepted the buddhist view that attachement leads to suffering, so this red pill philosophy only reaffirms it for me. I don't hate women anymore because I don't need them (or one woman) to be happy anymore. I define my own worth and what is important to me, sure it's lonely but with time it's surprisingly easy to cope with. I've come to accept that I'll be lonely for the rest of my life, it doesn't scare me anymore as I feel that I'm in charge of my life, with a mindset that nobody else can dictate. I don't hate women anymore because I do understand them better, there's no need to hate reality and how it all fits together, deal with it.

I have some fantastic little nuggets you usually never hear from women

I decided to meet up with 3 seperate women (1 on 1), how I dont tolerate bullshit, and how I go for what I want. They all incredibly came out with some interesting points individually on what keeps them hooked;

1. ""You're arrogance is just sooo, Im assertive, and cocky, but she interprets it as arrogance. How many times are the beta's told ""I hate arrogance"" by women? So they introvert and try and be shy guys?

2. ""You just don't care"" - Carefree right? Ofcourse Im human, I feel no remorse. I've walked away a dozen times and kept my dignity. Not actually caring if I ""fail"" or succeed with any woman, is what keeps this lot at bay.

3. ""You make me laugh like nobody else"" - Probably because I speak my mind. I will ridicule her

4. ""You always have an answer

5. ""I love it so so much when you talk dirty to me"" - A necessity. Roosh said ""If you aren't being creepy

I suppose draw from it what you will

Just another minor note, but sex but nothing"" swear that was her text.

Our mission is to get the Media to finally take responsibility for our feelings and our self-worth.

We must protect women from any negative messages in the Media because we will naturally adopt them as our own beliefs — immediately

When we are bombarded with images of women who are prettier than us, it makes us feel as though there are women in the world who are prettier than us, thinner than us, and sexier than us.

The Media needs to change it's message

The Media needs to tell us that self-esteem can come from things other than beauty

The Media needs to start telling *all* women that they are beautiful

The Media needs to grow up

The Media has abdicated this responsibility to us for far too long. 

It's time for the Media to take responsibility for what we believe

---

As a member of GiveMeSelfEsteem™

How many more years do I have to keep on living with no self-esteem and no self-worth before the media will finally let me have some?

Why must the Media continually insist on perpetuating the illusion that there are women in the world who are thinner

How am I supposed to feel validated if men don't pay attention to me?

How will men pay attention to me if the media does not stop showing them women who are sexier than I am?

How am I supposed to feel pretty if there other women out there who feel prettier?

How am I supposed to feel thin when there are women in the world who are so much smaller than me?

How am I supposed to feel sexy if the Media doesn't tell me I am sexy?

Let me be clear, not my friends, not my family — YOU! 

That's why I'm so upset about the things you make me think

Only you have the power to decide what I believe.

What do you expect me to do? Just decide willy-nilly to believe something other than what you tell me? To all the sudden just choose to believe the opposite? Who do you think I am?

I don't decide what I believe

I am upset because I wanted to be healthy

I am upset because I wanted to be happy

I am upset because I wanted to have self-esteem in spite of my body

I am upset because I wanted to have self-worth in spite of my looks

I am upset because you are responsible for what I believe

It's not my favorite, but eventually the feminine imperative forces it's ugly head into all interactions and reminds women ever-so-subtly that I am not giving them ultimately what they desire (or think they desire) which is monogamy.

Funnily enough

Relationship strategy isn't discussed enough on here

**The Rotating Soft Harem**

I have ditched monogamy as an effective mating tool. As per Rollo's advice

The dating market is stacked seriously against men

The only rebuttal that I see fit is to keep a rotating harem of around three women at a time. It satisfies the plate spinning requirement

I have learned through trial and error that what we understand as monogamy is only to benefit women. They would like the security and validation that you are a one-gal-man. They, as well as analyzing all other potential mates. It's only a matter of time before another more apt branch is found.

To take your commitment from you

So we introduce the rotating soft harem.

**My Approach**

First of all

You don't start off on that note

I approach it very simply: ""I'm sorry

Some decide it's worth it. Others don't.

I don't talk to them about other harem members

I attempt to keep around 2 - 3 at a time

Most girls seem to do alright in it for about 3 - 4 months after ""the talk."" I've had a few last over a year.

(The bolded parts are verbatim; as soon as I had heard these words

I work with all women.  100%.  They are all relatively young (20s-30s), upper-middle-class, all health care professionals with good degrees from good schools making probably $30-$40/hour with full benefits.  They all have at least one kid, most of them have two.

Their husbands range widely in all those demographics (except race; they're all white).  Some are, making upwards of $100,000/year.  Some are working-class stiffs making $15-$25/hr at blue collar jobs with no post-secondary degrees.  Some are comfortable small business owners living from boom to bust with enough extra to be able to take their broods out to Red Lobster each Friday night and still pay the monthly mortgage bill.

One is unemployed.  This is his story.

This guy found out he had a congential defect (not sure what exactly) and has to have a heart transplant and has already undergone several surgeries. He is pretty much bed-ridden until that happens.  So his wife has been coming to work completely exhausted from taking care of the kids and house by herself AND working 40+ to pay for their daycare bills, YES, COUNT 'EM, THREE mortgages.   At first I felt sorry for her.  Then this conversation took place today where they were bashing the shit out of him for being a lazy father snd husband and that his wife deserves better.

Now I'm comfortable enough with these women that I felt safe stepping in to come to a brother's defense.  I said, there's not much he can do.""  They didn't attack me. They did something worse. 

They metaphorically left him to die, he needed to have saved more for emergencies or whatever, 'cause, like, if you're a mom, you need to be able to not work whenever you want.**

The concept of romanticism has been corrupted into the polar opposite of it's original definition and it's pretty fucking ridiculous.  Romanticism is a concept that was rooted in masculine thinking.  To romanticize something is to take something with little or no context and breathing your own context into it through allegory and philosophy to make others understand your state of mind and emotions.  I know just saying 'emotions' here can cause a big stir, and being tricked into irrationality.  Emotions fuel competitiveness, pride, reflection, domination, and many other masculine traits.

Seeing a man hunt down an animal, dominion, rivalry) than the raw act with no context.

That's all romanticism is

This is originally why women were attracted to romanticism in the first place.  It took the tales of common man and turned them into tales of good vs. evil, and strife.  

Somewhere along the line 'romantic' went from allegory to simply appeasing women.  Things that are 'romantic' in modern convention are exclusively female things

Is anyone else bothered by this?  I think being romantic is awesome.  I like taking all the cool shit that happens to me day-to-day and then retelling it to a group of people in a way that makes them fully understand.  Through allegory, the 'big picture'.  People never forget who you are.

Yet some bitter hags have the nerve to tell me I'm 'not romantic'.  Wine, and all that shit isn't romantic.  It has a clear context; ""obey the pussy"".  The cliche 'romantic' acts and gifts and dates have no metaphor or thought behind them BECAUSE they are CLICHES.  Anytime a chick brags to another chick ""Look what (insert nancy-boy here) did/bought me! Isn't that ROMANTIC?"" translates to ""Look at all the hoops this kid jumps through to appease me!"".

She gives me an incredulous look. ""You really shouldn't be dating girls that young! Remember when you were that young?? You weren't ready for a relationship back then!

- banged a co worker for a while on a temporary assignment

- banged an army officer who was touring her area

It's one thing to discuss the principles of SMV on this forum. Its another matter entirely to see how the mighty have fallen. All of her best eggs have been bled out. Unlike us men, and the older the eggs get, the more likely they are to produce unhealthy babies.

We all know the reason why brothers and sisters shouldn't procreate right? The genes are much more likely to produce birth defects. When eggs get older, she has the same chance of producing an autist or a downs baby as a healthy 18 year old would if she reproduced with her blood brother. Its not the vaccines that cause autism, ladies, its your aging eggs.

As always, I know I wouldn't have when I was younger, but seriously... becoming a man and embracing the masculine qualities that make one changes the whole dynamic. I read an article on the front page of Macleans while I was at the dentist which read ""Women, man up- the way to having a powerful career is to act like men"".

Roosh is being uncharitable to his fellow men here. He is essentially saying that the only opposition to feminism he cares for is that from those men who ""game"" endlessly. Let's be honest here, bitter sexual losers as a consequence of the sexual revolution allowing desirable men to hoard female erotic capital.

The Mark Minter story is, no matter how much you rail against the marriage racket and how men are screwed by it, there remains the fact that men yearn for the sexual companionship and company of women. For Minter, the price of maintaining the consistency that Roosh demands would have been loneliness, which ultimately proved unbearable for Minter, as it would, really

Yes, or date multiple women simultaneously. This is, in fact, a zero-sum game. Your win is their loss. Conservative societies, by encouraging women to be modest and to save themselves for the man they marry, were nudging their societies towards a form of sexual socialism where every man finds a partner. Roosh -- the freedom YOU enjoy to easily sleep with multiple women ALSO means the freedom of women to reject, in their most beautiful years

OF COURSE the manosophere has in part significantly been driven by ""loser"" men. I'd argue that so has the entire PUA industry in fact (the gurus

Here's what I came up with:


* We know that female nature is essentially solipsistic.

* That means they're mostly concerned with how things and people affect them

* In other words

* Since they have relied upon men for survival throughout the eons

* Thus

* Ideally

* Therefore, but not responsibility, while the opposite is true for you.

* The key then

* I'd like to think about it as creating a sphere in which you

* You allow the woman and her little sphere into your larger sphere. Putting it another way

* While her sphere is part of your sphere, her actions rebound on herself, since she is essentially part of you.

* Therefore, they'll affect her in a positive way.

* Thus

* Essentially

* By working for yourself

* Remember though

* As long as the terms of the symbiosis are upheld

I know its a self delusion. I know they don't honestly think they'll get to be Mr. Universe from going to the gym once and a while.

There are so many small increases you can make, and you can stop your intense growth program and 4000 calorie a day diet whenever you are comfortable.

It is one of man's great joys in life to lift heavy objects. It is a role you were born into. Short? Great! You will fill out quickly. A little muscle will look great. Tall? Great! Fill out your shoulders and get a strong back / legs. You'll glow.

The excuse ""I don't want to get too big"" is a humblebrag of sorts. Its like saying 'yeah, haha, I'd look like Arnold Schwarzennegar afterward, and uhh, that could be inconvenient for me sometimes"". It sounds funny.

Any skinny or skinny fat guys who don't want to lift should just say ""I'm okay with being a puny pussy boy"" and save the false bravado of ""I don't wanna get too big"". 

For anyone looking at getting into lifting

Lifting has a lot of health benefits. It will release dopamine into your body, and your acheivment in the gym is accomplishing something, and you get to wear your trophy on your chest and shoulders and arms and legs everyday. Its also a hell of a lot cheaper than any other hobby. It will also make you learn to eat healthier, cook a certain type of food and get better at time management. It is also great for pushing out bad habits. Smoke? You won't want to after a set of heavy squats. Drink? It'll affect your gains. Cut back. Have trouble with women?

1364919069.0,1bit0x,"The Crunch - First post, it's pretty damn long, been lurking a while, if you fancy an uplifting read then have a look.",Jonny_SD_Alpha,15

I had recently asked a girl I liked out. She was sweet

I was pretty cut up. The pattern had repeated itself again. This is generally how I had tried to manage my relationships until that point. I would fall for a girl, get shot down. Ad infinitum. I spoke to my Dad about this. He said I shouldn't lose faith but instead wait for the right person and not get too cut up over individual failures. I still don't know what to make of this.

What made this example worse was the fact that I worked with two of her friends. Clearly they had been filled in on the situation. One of them asked me 'So you like to be dominated then?' I said nothing at the time but really I wanted to backhand her and violently penetrate her with a fucking corkscrew. She was soon promoted by my female boss. I'll come to the repercussions of this later. The second friend started to use me. Constantly making demands, grassing me in at every opportunity and generally trying to make my life difficult. My devastation deepened and I worried that I was going to lose it.

I had two jobs at this point, my confidence had gone negative and was troubled at my inability to find a girl to love. In short I was a mess, I considered myself a nice guy and couldn't understand why nothing was working out for me whilst other people were given everything they wanted without showing any visible effort or desire. Now I see this was depression, jealousy and blaming other people for my own faults and pussification. I was burning out because I was saying 'yes' to every demand made of me. I seriously considered suicide but realised that I couldn't hurt my family in that way.

Then strangely things started to fall together. I started to read Strontium Dog and began to identify with Jonny Alpha. A friend recommended reddit and I stumbled across TRP. My name is John so my mantra soon became 'I am Jonny Alpha'. I started doing weights, cigarettes and weed. I stopped drinking. I stopped asking permission. I stopped apologising. I looked people in the eye when I spoke to them. I didn't lean into conversations. I asserted myself and stopped backing down at the first sign of trouble. I stopped fiddling with things and broadcasting my insecurities. I began using three phrases a lot; 'stand for what you stand for', 'call 'em like you see 'em' and 'hold 'em tightly, lose 'em lightly'.

Not that this was easy. I was pretty well conditioned. I was disgusted about what I was reading. I thought this was the most vile form of mysogyny imaginable. That you guys treated women like dogs, but then why should I. Every ideology is flawed and has exceptions. I began observing the world around me and soon found countless parallels that tied into TRP ideology.

Some examples I hear you cry... OK but only because I want to provide them.

1) One of the waitresses at work was leading on a chef, he was pretty much a puppy. At a staff do she got off with the head chef, another chef and the manager. They all found this out later. Tony continued giving her lifts and all that shit. She turned up at work a few days later with bites all over her neck. Nobody knew where they had come from. Tony allowed himself to be convinced that he had done them. He went from angry to supplicant in about two minutes. I wanted to go over and slap him but that would only have further lowered his standing. I might send him a link to TRP now thinking about it. He might just read this and see the parallels. Other girls when they hear about this say that she is 'liberated'. I thought there might be some slut shaming at least. But no, they think this is an OK way to act.

2) Another girl I know has kept a fella infatuated with her for years. It's sad to see now

3) A girl who I used to fancy years ago. I asked her out. She said she wasn't looking for a boyfriend. Within a week she was going out with an arrogant tosser. Ended up miserable because he treated her like shit and physically abused her. Did she actually enjoy being treated like this and just used me to vent the negative aspects? Who knows? Who cares?

4) Guys in LTRs becoming miserable because they acquiesced to their GFs who invariably betafied them

5) Hell even the language of sex. 'Grow some balls', 'Pulling birds' etc. Who fucks who? Guys fuck girls. Girls get fucked by guys.

6) Shit tests are everywhere. Don't back down from them. Be funny

7) Just thought of another one. A girl I used to work with told me she had rape fantasies, started calling me 'pussy' and 'stupid' to my face, bad mouthed me to other members of staff and eventually started going out with a 35 year old guy who 'reminds me of my dad'. In the end I preferred the company of her dog to her. If only I knew then what I know now. She was pretty fucked up though. The dog's cool though. We still hang out. That was always because I wanted to though. 

So what is the point of this diatribe? Basically TRP community I want to say thanks for opening my eyes. It was difficult and it has taken a good three months to get through the denial parts of this. I know I have a lot more to develop, slept with her, met her family, seen how she lives and tested her to see if she is to my satisfaction.

If anybody has any questions or needs clarification don't hesitate to ask. I'm still not entirely there but every day I grow and strengthen. Now I am like steel; every challenge tempers me and makes me stronger. My biggest source of confidence is that I did this myself. Nobody helped me. I took advice from online but in my own life nobody was willing to lend a hand. I'm pissed at my Dad to be honest because he never took the time to explain these things to me. Perhaps he doesn't know. I don't know. Perhaps he can't articulate his own thoughts and behaviours in the manner that I'm attempting to here. There are issues between us that need to be resolved.

Oh yeah the repercussions of that bitch getting a promotion. The same day I quit my job. I did it in a calm and controlled manner. My bosses asked me to stay. They offered me a pay rise to stay, Taiwan, Indonesia or Malaysia wherever I get a solid offer and a contract first. Hell wherever I choose to go. I have interviews tomorrow. This is something I've always wanted to do. So now I have the confidence to just go and do it. I'm 25 this month. I regret that I hadn't taken TRP sooner. I would have been happier earlier in my life. But I'm still young and have plenty of time to practise before I hit my prime. 

Cheers guys.

Moved in with 2 male blue pill best friends and a HB7.8 who we kind of knew. 

The girl we lived with wanted a relationship with me but I didnt want to. I can do better for a relationship and would have no space if I was living with her

Heard/sort-of-saw her sleeping with a good friend of mine. Didnt care too much but she saw it as stopping us from being together, as she knew i knew.

I did not know what getting gaslighted was. I thought such a concept was exclusive to horror films. 

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaslighted

The extent to which I had it was: she convinced me I had psychosis and had had multiple hallucinations. She convinced my closest friends and then growing circles of mutual friends that I was hallucinating. I went from a dominant of a large group to the butt of jokes. 

Thing is

Your brain cant put something behind you if you arent sure if it was a hallucination or not - your brain kind of has-to-know whats real in order to move on. I stayed strong (believing what i saw was real) for a month before I gave up and believed everyone. My sleep was fucked, and then after about 3 weeks started to get paranoia ('she must be a psychopath! look at all these things she is doing!'). Nearly lost my job. Bear in mind i had quit the weed the first sign of trouble so it wasnt that. Had to take a week off work to confront the fact it might not have been real. 

She did lots of little things, was used:  http://www.rickross.com/reference/brainwashing/brainwashing11.html .

I really did suffer - I believed I was mentally ill after enough people told me I was for enough time. When people started making fun of me for it for their own relative status boost it was more hurtful than I want to admit, but you cant leave your own head.

Anyway it all fell apart when one of the later hallucinations had a second witness

Now NAWALT. But I generally learnt about the bad side of all people

------

**Lessons learnt:**

- A very good way to model people is to know about their upbringing. The girl's dad is the biggest loser (hate to say it...) i have ever met. Mother treated him like shit in front of us when we met them briefly. Her opinion of men growing up must have been that they are inferior... She has an older sister who looks nothing like her at all but they are supposedly related. My housemates were both completely blind to the most obvious lies and social cues

- Majority of men are truly oblivious to most obvious things, even if you demonstrate total understanding...

- My mother said: 'There are two types of liars in the world. Those who cant look you in the eye when they do it, who confidently tell a lie'. This generalisation ignores many of the self-cognitive-dissonance methods, but for a massive cant-even-fool-yourself-into-justifying-it lie i think she is correct on there being two main types. The second one is lethal when used right! Even when warned of it it feels like your belief alters a little nudge.

- When somebody is trying to alter your memory they will get you to think back

- Look out for people making their ideas sound like they are your ideas.

- Dont trust anyone if they tell you 'you cant trust your eyes and your ears', a good honest man, but he ultimately was self-interested and fooling himself along with me.

- Blue pills will always side with an attractive woman in some way. Abundance mentality is needed not just for seduction.

- Your mother is a woman and she also will 'hamster' to protect her baby. Understand her incentives.

- When somebody says 'Are you calling me a liar?' when you happen to point out a logical inconsistency

- Do not always be rational. If you are 99.9% sure something is not a hallucination then say 100%

- Learn to keep your mouth shut about subtle signals and lies you pick up

- When it comes to people treating you well / helping you out in a real time of need, so they believed her as they didnt care about what really happened. If you become weak then they will leap at the chance to get above you, no matter what you have done for them in the past. Old friends with nothing to gain, strong good men, and some good caring women tend to be the exceptions. The people who still help you when you are weak and low value are your real friends, its worth faking low value once in a while to find out who stabs you in the back. 

- If you get ostracised it doesnt matter. Depression and anxiety were probably survival responses to stop our ancestors from being ostracised from their tribe

I'm unsure if TRP can really save a husband who has been lost in beta-land for years

Here's a little about me:  I'm in my early 30s, but will be jumping off the kid cliff within the next couple of years.  I discovered TRP-esque techniques about 10 years ago, 4 years before I started dating my future wife.  When I met her, I was thoroughly finished with my transformation, so she knows nothing of the old me.  She was an overlord bitch in her previous dating life because she dated beta douchebags.  The power vacuum of a beta doormat boyfriend will always be filled by the woman.  ...and it's not pretty.  Ever since she started dating her first alpha (me), she's become submissive, and she highly respects me.

My married life is as kick-ass as married life could possibly be.  There is no fighting.  Her shit-tests are basically non-existant.  We have sex when I want to, ""So how's married life?""  I look them squarely in the eye and respond truthfully with, ""exactly the same as before we got married.""  That usually gets me incredulous looks from the old, broken down, beta married men.  ...but it's the truth.  She's still madly in love, and I'm still the hero.

It is indeed possible to get married, and have an awesome time doing it.  It's hard for me to quantify just how much I play the game, because it's who I am now.  The insecure dumbass that I used to be is so long gone, and the person that busts women's chops and steals thunder is just who I am now.

I've discovered that women will live out a fantasy WAY longer than it's even remotely rational to do so.  For example, so she stuck out like a sore thumb), she introduced herself as my stalker, not even saying her name.  People would ask her what she did for work and she would reply with, ""I stalk alpha_husband.""

Years and years later, I give her shit and accuse her of stalking me, and you can see it in her eyes.  She's still just as infatuated with me as she was so many years ago.

I don't think I'll ever get tired of flipping those switches inside her head and playing her like a fiddle.  She is still very concerned with her weight and looks (she hasn't gotten fat like the millions of wives who've left the dating market and let themselves go).  My wife feels like she needs to keep trying to be good enough for me.  This is EXACTLY where she should be.

One day I got a huge bonus at work. For a while I was thinking about going on a trip or spending it on my girlfriend. But in the end I spent most of it on gear; Dbol and Test-E. My rational was I was always tired at work and test would help me be more energetic. Also it would help me push past my platues.

**Gear ended up changing my Personality**

There is a lot of talk about what it means to be an alpha male or a high test male. And you think you know what it means. However the only way to realy know is to add test into your system.

The first thing I noticed is I had more energy. I was more awake. A fog was lifted.
I needed less sleep to feel rested. I had a bigger appetite. I moved more quickly and with purpose. And with all that extra energy I felt like I could accomplish much more.

However there was a problem. I was energetic and more productive. But everyone still moved at their old slow pace. I wanted to do things I wanted to try things, boring. I wanted to have deep conversations, question common wisdom. No one wanted to have a conversation if it wasn't 100% politically correct.  I grew bored with talking to most people. Those conversations felt boring and scripted.

My sense of self worth grew. I felt like a god. I saw myself as truly better than the slow masses

Women picked up on my confidence. I no longer had approach anxiety. I would walk up to girls because I was bored and I saw them as a source of entertainment. I would start stupid conversations with women just to be entertained by their reactions: 

Hey are you the girl from Craigs list?* NO!* I was supposed to meet a girl who looks just like you
*Ew No do I look like a prostitute men are such pigs! Fuck You!* Oh im sory I was trying to buy a textbook and the girl said she was blond at about your height. Girl feels terrible starts apologizing. I get infinite lols maybe a phone number.

When I came of my cycle. I no longer had the same feeling of superiority. However the behavior patterns that I developed while being a high test stayed with me. Being an Alpha felt realy good

The author is of the previous generation of Afrikaners that tend to be religious and conservative. 

Translation:

While writing this letter, need to hold back my anger. I see my daughter – a successful young woman – beautiful, soft, following God, yet still unmarried, just like many of her female friends.

I also see large groups of men, successful. What I don’t see is young men taking young women out on coffee dates to get to know each other better. I only see large groups socialising together. I see men in their comfort zones – the choice is his to ask a girl out or not. In the mean-time the girls are waiting, uncomfortable, because after all it is the roll of the man to take charge, isn’t it?

I see young men, who sit on their porch in the evenings drinking wine [note: Afrikaans culture is big on wine so it’s perfectly acceptable for two masculine heterosexual male flatmates to sit on their porch drinking wine], and I ask myself “where is the women in their lives? Why sit on the porch with your flatmate and at this age still make no attempt to find the woman of your dreams?”

I see young women becoming increasingly independent. WHERE HAVE ALL THE GOOD MEN GONE?

I see women struggling to carry heavy shopping bags; I see women washing cars; I see women going to dangerous places to make a difference in the lives of others
Did the word “expectations” become too taboo? Nobody wants to go on one-on-one coffee dates because “what if…”

What if an “expectation” is created? What if it doesn’t work out and it means the end of a friendship? They would rather socialise in a group where everybody is comfortable

1365929424.0,1cbglh,Thank you TheRedPill... my eyes are open and I will no longer be a beta,killerbyte1985,63,20,17,"In 2011 I had my first long-term relationship. Before my ex I had two sexual encounters so I was relatively inexperienced when it came to women. I had only come out of my shell when I was 24.

So back to my ex. I was attracted to my ex for her physical qualities as well as her personality traits. Being raised by a single mother I didn't really like weak women. Oh how I was a fool. I assumed the beta role perfectly and my ex loved it. She had a man slave to do anything she wanted and who wanted to do anything to make her happy. I was also a giving lover

She broke up with me and I was devestated. Then she found out she was pregnant and I moved in with her. She maintained that we werent in a relationship

When I found out that she had given birth I contacted her and asked to come see my little girl. She then professed her love for me. She maintained that lie for a few months with me happily paying child support and seeing my daughter for a few hours a week. 

By this stage my sexual experience had increased. I had been with far more women and had found that legs spread quicker when I showed Alpha qualities. I am 1.95m tall so when I hid my natural beta behaviour behind a confident Alpha mask I found that women submitted to me. Single women, older, it didn't matter. I had married women begging me to come over while husband was at work. They wanted to be dominated by an Alpha. I will be honest, this both frightened me as well as excited me. I was, and still am, drunk on this power.

My ex had grown more distant at this point but I think she could smell the Alpha at this point and one day asked me if I wanted an NSA relationship. I rejected her offer

The new guy in her life has more money than me and owns a house in a very nice neighbourhood but he is obese

I am still internalising many of the materials on this subreddit. My sexual encounters are increasing in number because of the Alpha tactics I use. I am a writer so I find that texting is a serious weapon for me. I can get inside their minds

Yeah, high-quality partner who knows her preferences and cares if she comes or not, or, sloppy, drunken copulation with the first passable male who comes along?

As always, that's why we get it up and finish with ease, no such thing with women though. It is beneficial for them both from the biological as well as social perspective to have sex within longer-term relationships.

Why don't they then? There are a few key reasons I can think of:

* Crippled self esteem and the need for validation  

That one is self-explanatory, whatever gets you through the night.

* The need for novelty

That's probably the healthiest incentive of them all. We all like the thrill of the unexpected and wonder what else is out there

* The lack of control over primal urges

A simple irresitible need to fuck right there and then when a suitable opportunity presents itself. The crowning attribute of ""cheating whores"". I don't have to explain why you don't want a girl who has no control over her animal brain.

* The inability to commit

Again

And the most common one:

* The quality gap between men willing to have no strings attached sex and those willing to commit.

A phenomenon well-described in the red pill writings. Inflating her ego with vanishing alpha cock can really send her perception of her Sexual Market Value and standards to the Neverland. The oh so sweet sperm of a drunk

One Tuesday night about a month ago I dropped by a usual cocktail bar.  I know a lot of the staff, only real option was a 2-set with a group nearby watching them.  I sit next to them and catch up with some of the staff.

After a beer and a smoke, and a brunette called Sara sat at the bar next to me.  I had seen them close down 3 approaches and decided to practice getting closed down.  

Sara was next to me, to come over and shared her plight with him and ask him to make them something awesome. I also ordered a cocktail, which I tried to get the two ladies to pay for, but was turned down.  I had my drink added to my tab, and made sure their drinks went on their tab.

We chat, they are both 34 and work together.  Their boss was paying for the whole thing.  Who I was told was a lovely, sweet guy but a little weird.

Jane was single, and sounded like they ate well.  Jane is the life of the party, but hasn't aged as well as Sara. They had spent the day at a spa, their make up was either very light or natural, nothing over the top.

Jane clearly knew the game; constant escalating kino, but she initiated kino and flirted, but it was far more subtle and restrained.  During our chat, Sara sat directly next to me with Jane to her left, opposite me.  Jane spent a lot of time leaning over Sarah to interact with me.

After an hour or so

They were furious

The slew of profanities I was called was astounding.  I feigned innocence, other people are watching as Jane argues with bartender.  My pal suggests I hide and let him take care of it, so I grab my coat and head to the other side of the bar.

After 30 minutes or so I head for a smoke and bump into Sara.  She calls me an asshole and asks me to sit next to her.   I tell her I forgive her for making a silly assumption like i would buy strangers a drink and causing a scene.  She calls me a cheeky bastard and apologises for the drama. We discuss why I'm an asshole when I'm actually a nice guy, lotta diamonds), how many kids I want, why she has none, her travels around the world.

She informs me that I messed up and could have gotten with Jane, I change the subject and then her hamster goes into overdrive.

She drags me back inside, except Sara will not let go of my hand.

She insists up buying me drinks for the rest of the night (""are you trying to get me drunk?"") and covers the door charge for a club.  All while dragging me by my hand, and an asshole.

She tries to k-close 4 times and I turn her down; remind her she is married, so I head over and in the time it takes me to spin and hug two, she is dragging me away.

She demands my number, and calls me more names.

And girls want to fuck alpha males. Let it piss you off as much as you want, and no matter how long you listen to her, she'll never think of you as anything other than asexual? The one who will curl up next to you on the couch, hug you close, kiss you on the cheek, and never let you fucking touch her beyond that?
Yeah
The hot girl who won't even look at you when you nod at them and smile? The one who laughs when you trip in the hallway and drop your stuff? The one who comes up and coyly aks for your help with her homework
Yeah
The geeky girl you think might be enough like you that you have a chance with her? She plays warcraft on your server
Guess who just sucked me off and told me they'll always love me?

And what's more? I laugh at guys like you. When you cry about how much girls treat you bad, don't give up hope man. But inside? I'm laughing my ass off at you you pathetic fuck. Every girl you set your sights on, who isn't a disgusting pig-monster, I'm going to fuck 6 ways from sunday before you even tell her you think she's cute. I won't bother trying when you finally settle for that 350 pound girl who works at hardees, you can have that. Anything else I'm going to cum on her face before you get those lips near it.  
And the biggest reason I laugh? It's not me doing all this. It's the girls. When you cry about how lonely you are? Or talk about how you just want to curl up and disappear, you're great for that. But her baby-maker is barking orders at her, telling her to wrap her legs around me and hold on for as long as she can. She needs it, on a primal level you'll never get to see first hand, even if you do get a chance to fuck her. Sooner or later one of them will lay back and spread their legs, but you won't see any hunger in their eyes. They won't beg you to love them forever and make them yours. You won't know what it's like to see her animal side needing you as much as she needs to eat and breath.

And she's cheating on you, wanting you to just back away and leave her alone, it's not her period. It's because I haven't called her for a day or two and her instincts are telling her to go find me. The primitive section of her brain doesn't want to risk smelling like another man when she gives herself to me, she wants me to know she's completely mine. We do things together she tells you she never would. Her pooper? Mine. I want to give her a facial? of course. I want her to suck the cum out of my dick, even though I just finished pumping away at her ass? she's never going to tell me no. She doesn't WANT to tell me no. She wants me to know she'll do anything it takes to keep me. She'll rim my ass while she's down there sucking me off if it means pleasing me. She'll drink my cum from a shotglass. She'll wear a buttplug when we go out to dinner. She'll sleep handcuffed to my headboard. Anything.
And then she'll go home to you and tell you she's not in the mood today.  
I'd say you should become an hero, I'll keep that pussy warm while you're crying in the corner.""

I thought about her a lot. She talked to me, listened to all her problems, gave logical advice to all of them. I bought her stuff for her birthdays like vodka and other small items that I knew would be useful to her. This went on for a long time.


**A _long_ time, but I'm just now realizing that I was probably failing them at a record pace.


**SO**,"" and what hers were, and asking what mine were. I took this opening and told her outright that I really liked her and wanted to take her out sometime. She flat out refuses to answer me. I let it go and return home.


The next day, similar story. She would *only* lay with me on the couch, nothing more, for over a month. Eventually, we made it into her bedroom, where *nothing changed.* She would have no touching of private parts or kissing or anything. I pretended to be super okay with ""taking things slow."" Eventually, after over six weeks of the worse cock teasing you could imagine, actually. This was my first sexual encounter of any kind


A couple days later, you have to realize that I had spent my entire adult life pining after this damaged girl, hoping to be nice enough to her that she would decide to sleep with me regularly. Clearly, this plan did not work, and I was frustrated, angry, sad


This story isn't over.


After agreeing to give each other a little time/space and being a miserable shitbag for a week or so, I think it was a ""rebound"" effect, looking for validation anywhere I could find it.


When I met Candy, I had moved to a girl who was younger, hotter [7+], and smarter, by a _lot_.** She took my virginity, and we started having sex regularly.


Something had clicked in my mind. I was now aware that it was in fact possible to talk to a girl and get them to sleep with me. I was just as fucking shocked as anyone else who knew me that I had scored.


I then learned that Becky was **extremely** distraught over these events. She didn't have the nerve to tell me directly, ect ect. I wasn't sure how to feel about it.


I developed... feelings... for Candy, because the Becky game plan didn't fucking work. I had to do something else. I decided the best way was to be freely honest about everything and not worry or give a shit about anything. I was me, for better, and certainly for worse.


**This worked for a few months until she broke up with me for ""no reason.""** I took this event a little better than I took Becky's rejection. Either I was just getting numb to rejection


A week later, that ""over"" didn't always mean *over*, that doubletalk and newspeak weren't shit when compared to the unchartable tangle of dialogue that is woman.


I had learned through my robust network of broformants that Candy had spent the last couple days fucking another guy. She did not mention this to me. I thought about it


I mean, we got along so well.


This is where something *actually* clicked in my head, but I had reservations about being her ""boyfriend.""

At this point we had sex. Some sort of underlying anger must have seeped out during this event, in almost a **DECADE**. It was pretty awesome sex though.

Following this, and perhaps I have. But I did not forget. I cannot readily describe the latent feelings of... *something*. Resentment maybe? Mistrust? Those feelings still don't make sense though because I really think I love this girl. She's perfect.

I didn't immediately notice, sometimes I would refuse. Sometimes I would ask her to do stuff **for me**, and she would actually do it. Often I would do stuff for her, sometimes I wouldn't.

I still cannot accurately describe why and how I was treating Candy differently, who she was with, shit like that.

Becky and I still talk as friends. It's *really* strange for me to know that I could just go back to her, but Becky fucked with me pretty badly on a level I wasn't prepared to deal with.

Candy and I are still going out. We interact a little differently now

Anyway, who had been in her orbit for a number of years.

So BA has a woman who is the throes of [1] Hashimotos disease Some of the symptoms of which are wild mood swings

So you can imagine what living with her was like. Even despite the condition she still followed the standard pattern

She lost her job, who paid all her bills and looked after her while she took on work when she could. To be fair she was pretty sick by this point, with really awful fatigue.

Anyway, and I really wanted to surprise my wife. I was in a completely different country when they had the weekend, but BA loathed what I did. BA was (and still is) of the opinion that I was trying to steal his gf, despite the fact I was in a long term relationship, and I am now married.

Perhaps it was because I represent what he wished he had. I will admit I have a hot wife, while BA constantly talked about moving to the UK and earning the big IT bucks there.

I would politely remind him (via MT) that unless he had a UK passport (he didn't) the ability to get one easily (he didn't) The UK was a fucking stupid idea, so he stayed in his crap ass town, and earned crap ass money.

At this point I managed to convince MT to get a proper thyroid function test set done, but also that any time she approached him for sex and initiated, he'd turn her down because he found sexually aggressive women a turn off.

So with no outlet, she decided to go back to Uni and study law. (lol)

So anyway

Anyway

BA then suggests ""not tells"" MT that maybe she should move back home until she is well

That's the story so far. MT is still hamstering hard because she doesn't want to move home

So yeah.. that's happening..

Hi guys

I'm posting here because I'm not interested in the advice I would get from anywhere else on reddit. From what I can tell

I'm in my late twenties and so is my girlfriend. We've been in a relationship for three years

We don't ever fight. She is really down-to-earth, never talks back, knows how to deal with my occasional bad temper, jumps into my arms every single time I come home, perfectly matches my sexual appetite and we have a lot of fun living toghether.

I made a common mistake at our early casual sex stage, I never had a definite moment of heartache although it did bother me a bit from time to time. She also cheated on one of her exes while moving on to the next guy. That's bad but I chalked it up to the guy being a loser and her being young.

This one night

What I found out and made my heart sink is that the guy she had a threesome with contacted her a few months ago and along with some friendly chatter he asked for her permission to include the story of that night in a porn novel he was writing on his conquests. My girlfriend starkly forbid it saying that her life was to fall apart if I ever found out.

I couldn't stomach it. This guy was not one of her loser boyfriends who got lucky once

I confronted her and she broke down

I did calm down. I guess it had to do with the fact that she seemed so utterly shaken for the coming day and begged for forgiveness without trying to excuse herself

A week has past and although everything seems okay again, always a cheater? She was raised by very decent parents and if I didn't know she had a dumb first year in college, I would have never guessed. I'm asking for your thoughts.

I know my anguish comes from my own insecurities. I've never had problems with women

What would you guys do? Has anyone had a similar experience? Does it get better over time or should I dump her? It would break my heart but it still seems easier than erasing this stuff from my memory.

  So we're at a popular sports bar, then I make some glancing eye contact with the Asian when they walk by and let her see me checking her out.  I tell my buddy to sit tight.

Well about 10 minutes later, ""I like your watch, is that Michael Kors?""  But he didn't sound too confident and when she didn't really react he shrank away like he hadn't said anything.  The band was really loud, and I was having trouble for a few minutes thinking of an opening when the band suddenly stopped for a break.  I said something like ""I can finally hear my self talk..  wow I sound old huh?""  Admittedly one of my worst openers but I said it with confidence, and really just needed *something* to get them talking, at which point my buddy jumped in and started his natural gift of making them laugh.  The Asian that I was into was the queen of shit tests - I've never been barraged by shit tests like I was from this girl, but it seemed like every time I 'passed' she would give me a little smile.  (btw, but it was cute).  After talking to them for about 20 minutes, it's still really early.  We stuck around for another 30 minutes

  So we decide to leave - I have a good idea exactly which bar these girls will be at, but I tell him, we need to ignore them, lets go to the back, get some beers and scope out the talent. 

After a bit, and other random guys are striking up conversations with the girls.  I can sense we're losing them, so I first try acting aloof - the pool table was right near us so I go and talk to the guys getting ready to play, ask if there are people on the table, yadda yadda.  The Asian girl (the leader) was losing interest, and it's getting late, so I tell my buddy we need to display higher value (DHV) now.  I we go over to two girls at the bar alone - they look like complete bitches but they're all dolled up in fancy clothes and hair done so you could objectively say they were hotter.  I wasn't attracted at all, we return to the table and guess who is suddenly all over me?  Tells me she is from Bangkok and grabs my crotch.  

The bar is now closing and we have them reeled in so start to head to the cars.  One girl says she wants to go swimming in a pool.  I tell her I live across the street from the beach, so after a little playing with the brunette (sorry I couldn't resist) I tell her to go out to see my friend.  

After the Asian girl gets out of the shower, and within minutes we're back in my room fucking.  

  I think we could have easily had a nice big orgy..  but I don't think my buddy would be into that.  After I finish with the girl she asked if we can go watch her friend getting fucked.  Sure

I continue to be shit tested - afterwards she says ""You are big tall guy, but she claims her husband doesn't care if she fucks other guys).  She texts me after ""Thank you :)""  ""Call you sometime sometime""

1374960802.0,1j6jf4,[FR] The Flight Attendant and the Damsel in Distress,Radikus_Rex,60,18,32,"First time posting after a month of reading through TRP theories. I don't generally agree with everything I've read on this subreddit

**Background**

I drive 18-wheelers for a large trucking company, I do this job because I love travelling and I think it gives me some interesting stories. 

**Inviting the Blue-Pills along**

I called up my cousin and asked if he wanted to come out, I like meeting new people.

They show up at the bar and we play some pool. We're having an okay time, baseball hats, converse/vans shoes, etc) This doesn't normally bother me, but I feel that just putting a little effort into your outfits makes a huge difference.

**The Flight Attendant**

We take turns paying for the pitchers, introduce myself and we all go through the rounds of awkward introduction. I make some jokes about them not remembering our names, talking about the band, etc.

A couple older guys come up and act annoyed at us ""stealing their spot"" (aka their targets) but I just smile at them, you should come sit closer."" She gets up and sits next to me. We talk back and forth, I find out she was a flight attendant for a year overseas. 

I can tell she's probably in her late twenties, and tell her to put her number in my phone so I can text her naughty things. I immediately text her ""naughty things"" and she laughs. 

I'm sure as a flight attendant she is used to turning down awkward pickup lines from desperate men, and I think that detachment really helped me out.

I go to grab another round of drinks (My cousin and his friends have all run out of cash, Ben, and his girlfriend, Jane. I introduce myself to her and she immediately says ""I'm Ben's Girlfriend!"" before she even gives me her name. I shrug it off and go drop off the round of drinks with my cousin and his friends.

**Ditching the blue-pills for new ones**

My cousin and his friends are chatting with a couple new girls at their table

Whatever. Not really interested. My brother's friends are leaving to another place

I just look him in the eye and say ""No man, so I say goodbye to my cousin and leave with the new group.

**Shit gets ugly**

We go to a few new bars, and I notice that Ben and Jane are having a fight over [random drunk relationship bullshit]. 

I leave the club alone and am walking in the street, and Ben even pushes her at one point and storms off. I don't really know Jane that well, but I go make sure she's doing alright, and offer to call her a cab home. She refuses, says she wants to go out and have fun without him. (Yeah, okay).

We go to one more club, eye contact, smiling, making it very obvious she wants me to validate her to make her feel better about her relationship. She keeps asking my height but I keep giving her bullshit answers (""I'm this tall"" holding up my hand at head level). 

I get ridiculously sweaty dancing with a number of people and so I head out to the patio to get some air. Jane follows me, but I know her boyfriend, and I'm mostly just looking out that she doesn't go seeking attention from someone who might actually go for it). So instead I try to get her to wingwoman for me, which she refuses.

She keeps trying to escalate things, and always standing next to me. I basically ignore her advances and don't reciprocate, but it has the red-pill effect of making her want me even more.

**The Damsel makes me realize something**

I finally realize that this whole bar/club scene is starting to gross me out. I keep seeing examples of women and men all there to get attention or sex, or initiating contact, but I'm not really having it. But the more I push away, the more of a pulling effect it seems to have. At the end of the night a number of girls are talking to me, inviting me to after-parties, numbers, etc. I turn them all down. Some get really offended and just go to the next guy over to try their luck with him

I haven't been drinking since midnight, thankfully) but Jane is stranded. Guess who she wants to drive her home? I reluctantly agree, since it's on the way, and at least I know she'll get home safe that way.

In the car ride she is obviously drunken and emotional, but I just offer her a handshake and tell her good luck. She obviously wants my number or something more, but I just put the car in reverse and drive off.

**What I learned**

* I know this wasn't the traditional field report since I didn't really escalate anything

* I know I had a chance to go home with a number of women

* It was more important to me to make sure Jane made it home safely, but her neediness was just sad to me. In the end I'm more satisfied with getting her home safe than going home with some drunken bar girl. 

*Thanks for reading. Hopefully you found this report helpful, I'd appreciate your stories*

Give yourselves a pat on the back

If you're not in the mood

&gt; So I met this woman on the internets see, with sex an option but not primary. We had gotten together once, a month or so ago (I have very little time free of child care responsibilities where I can make visits like this happen) and had lots of wonderful cuddles and some outstanding sex.

I can't fucking stand that opening sentence. Fuck. And considering the rest of his post

A month later, but she doesn't want to have sex with him. Naturally, being a male, he feels irked. In fact, he tells the readers of /r/SRSMen that he found himself thinking the following, and he was _so ashamed for thinking it_:

&gt; wait, and you know I won't be, and I don't get too...

And:

&gt; oh

Dude

&gt; What the deal was is that she's had a few situations lately where she had said ""yes"" to men that she didn't really want to say ""yes"" to

In the ensuing one month, so she couldn't help but keep saying ""yes"" to all those different evil men. **Naturally, she decided to wipe the cum from her exploits on this pitiful creature, using him for emotional support while saving her pussy for the real men.**

What's his takeaway?

Background:
I've had this girl A [HB 8] in my harem for the last couple of months, she was hooked and everything was good. Apparently, last week she found out that I have been seeing two other girls, and she went into full desperation mode. So she calls a meeting of all her feminazi friends, who all tell her that I'm a lying asshole and should be thrown to the side of the road. She thought she had me since I had no idea this was going on. So she thinks up (and rehearses) a full verbal beatdown, and gets psyched for the most epic moment of man bashing she'll ever have in her life. 

That moment came on Thursday. I was chilling at home

Bro 1 gets the door. ""Hey A

A: ""Is uvraise here

I heard the tone in her voice

Me: ""Hey A what's got your panties in a knot?""

This enraged her further. A: ""HEY ASSHOLE MY FRIEND TOLD ME YOU'VE BEEN SEEING TWO OTHER GIRLS YOU FUCKIN PIG."" 

I saw this becoming a pretty big scene. She keeps yelling at me, come over tonight. I'm heading over to (some person)'s house for a party, get dressed up and meet me there."" 

I hang up

If you are non reactive the comments start becoming more honest and reveal how her mind is working during the interaction. 

It usually happens when I stop talking and just make eye contact through awkward silences in the conversation.  This is what happened last night when the girl I was talking to said ""you seem safe.""  At first I didn't understand what she meant. Did she mean I was a safe boring nice guy?  I asked her to explain. 

She said almost every guy she talks to has and extreme variance in their mood, not genuine. 

She said that everything about me was consistent (ie frame). If I didn't want to smile I didn't smile. If I didn't want to laugh I didn't laugh. I didn't change the pitch of my voice. She said ""that makes me feel comfortable and safe.""  (Once I understood what she meant I found her choice of the word ""safe"" interesting. The first thing I thought of was her biological function to seek out a mate that can provide safety and security.)

I thought back to the times where I had been that inconsistent guy talking to girls for hours while unbeknownst to me they were probably all thinking what this girl just described but didn't say anything.

I have no qualms with her life choices (I just wouldn't date her). However, what's the long-game? Marriage? How long would it be after everything she wants is secured before the hamster kicks in and she doesn't have sex with him again? Suddenly this nice gesture of her affection becomes an ""obligation"", then a ""chore"", then (if the hamster is on a roidrage) ""oppression/rape."" The hamster is spinning to cover up the idea that *she is done fucking around and wants marriage, but needs to fuck this guy's brains out long enough to secure that*. 

It goes without saying that the fact that she's an ex-prostitute means sex has been reduced to a chore. A sexually promiscuous woman would have similar feelings I imagine. Bad long-term investment if you value sex in your relationships where she holds the power of the family courts. 

An important note is not one person on that thread is saying ""break up with him so he can find someone that's truly sexually compatible.""

So

Last night though was a real break through for both myself and my wife. My wife really is a good woman and tries her best. She is a good mother and really takes care of me (in a very traditional way). I do my part, she has a very strong personality and will speak her mind to anyone. This is something that I love, but its always annoying when it is directed at me. 

We don't argue much anymore as we are both re-learning our roles in our marriage and get along much better than before

Right as I was getting to my boiling point, she can't have a honest argument without getting personal because her rationale is based on emotions.
I waited for her to finish her, at the same time her argument was completely based on something else, so in her mind it was correct.

She just looked at me and started crying. She replied that she was frustrated all along because I would argue with her like we were equals

For so many years I thought that having an argument/disagreement with your wife was supposed to be like I was told in health class, is free to disagree or ask anything she wants; but, at the end of the day, I will make the choice and she will support me.

After that she talked about how what I was saying in the argument was right but that she was scared about the choice because of ""Insert Example Here"". She knew she was being irrational but needed me to be a man and tell her that it would be ok. 

I will say that for the last few months

TL;DR -- Last night my wife told me that she needed me to be the ""captain"" in the relationship at all times. She told me to start treating her like the soft woman she was and not to argue with her like she was a man and my equal because she said she wasn't. Jesus,False,,t5_2ve1u,1369979036.0,rp,,t3_1fe0bg

I grew up from a very young age without a father.  This is a tremendously disadvantageous starting point in terms of developing a full and positive masculine identity.  Naturally you look to the men around you as examples.  I grew up with uncles and family friends who were marines, iron workers, and carpenters.  On the surface all of these men had the trappings of masculinity and as a child I never questioned it.  As as an adult it's painfully obvious that these same men are not and never were in control of their lives.  

Most of them, taken out second mortgages, and don't have enough money to retire.  They they haven't taken care of their bodies.  They are essentially mindless robots who take orders from their wives and go to work to pay a mortgage they they're never pay off.  

I feel like I'm surrounded by these kind of men even in my own peer group.  I have a friend who did two tours in Afghanistan.  He is 6'4'' 230lbs.  He goes out of his way to assert his masculinity.  He always tries to show that he is the biggest

Why are these seemingly masculine men choosing to live like this (if you can even call it living)?  I believe this goes beyond societal pressures and norms.  I believe on some level this is a choice because despite how hellish it obviously is in many ways it's easier to not take a harsh look at yourself

I’ve always wanted love; I think that this is the natural instinct in men. With love
I’ve kissed quite a few girls, but mostly due to fear of her opinion of an old virgin. I’ve figured that male virginity, for most girls, means lack of pre-selection at the sexual level, and is a turnoff. I was embarrassed about this at 20 and every year the embarassment increases. Even the incel in the sidebar lost his virginity at 17. Everyone here seems to have had his heart broken by acting completely bluepill or had his ass handed to him in a divorce. I feel alone in my situation. 

I’m fairly outgoing. I go to parties, I’m not really into video games or religion, which is what I think explains some incels. I spend time on my wardrobe and working on my body. For the most part, I get along fine with everyone and I don’t think about my virginity except in moments of occasional introspection. Last night was one of those moments; I couldn’t sleep because these thoughts kept me up. All of the sudden I realized that I’m not young and I may not lose my virginity until my mid-30s.

I’m in medical school, then starting next year, there is no time anymore for any social extracurriculars. Studying and medical extracurriculars are all that I will focus on. I realized this and it frightens me. I can’t fuck up medical school for something as fickle as losing my virginity. And, like I said, I don’t think about this most days. In med school, I’m surrounded by people like me. There are people who went into school in a relationship and others, like me

I asked my parents about this problem in an indirect way a while ago, it’s worked well for them, but they are products of a different time and place. A major milestone in my life is missing.

I could just go for the bottom of the barrel, part of my brain says it needs to be special. Also, I genuinely am not attracted to fat girls; they’re about as sexy as men are to me. I don’t avoid them in daily life or anything, but I can’t actually imagine having sex with them. 

The best scenario would be this: I meet a girl and we hit it off and fall in love. I open up to her and we have sex with her understanding my virginity. But unless I’m really close to the girl

If I were to predict advice from other subreddits it would be this:
 
Any female-dominated relationship subreddit:
*Virginity’s not that big of a deal. I’d love to meet a virgin man
When in actuality

I could go online dating

The seddit community looks like it is full of college students with posts like 
*I just got a phone number! What do I do now?!*
And to be honest
More recently

The med school girls split into a dichotomy: the straight-laced, this is true for the men too. Ideally, I would hit it off with one of them and live happily ever after, but that hasn't happened. The problem here is hypergamy: they don’t want a peer. And like the men, they tend to cut dating out completely and just plan to get married when they are professionally settled. 

I want redpill advice. For months

TL;DR: I’m a 26-year-old virgin in med school. I have three months where I have a lower workload and I want to lose my virginity in this timeframe. 

Edit: Alright, if I get a girl, I plan to not mention anything about virginity and just having awkward virgin sex with her. Thanks guys.

A friend of the host had told her that guys won't date her because they are intimidated by her being funnier than they are. A whole bunch of callers called in to tell her that isn't true. One caller actually fully demonstrated hypergamy by saying that she is having trouble finding a guy that is on equal ground as her. ""She doesn't want to date down."" One guy even called in to say that ""A woman should be seen but not heard."" He got ridiculed like crazy. 

About a month ago I had tweeted the radio host telling her she was full of shit for complaining about being single because she is attractive she should be dating. She responded by saying she doesn't have time. 

So I tweeted back this morning saying I had a crush on her because she was funny. She had already told me she didn't have time though. Her response was ""I have time if you're Robert Downey Jr."" 

I told her that her problem wasn't that she was too funny

Women consciously understand that professional, however, it seems there are a number of mental shortcuts they use to **subconsciously** test for these traits. 

They look for outward signs of the above attributes, dark triad traits, passing shit tests, putting women second to your life mission, demonstrating passion, demonstrating mastery, taking initiative, amused mastery

I think this is what’s responsible for the cognitive dissonance that so many women experience when they complain about not being attracted to the fit, but subconsciously are attracted to the latter because he is displaying those signs. Similarly, a guy can be consciously aware that some girl is a bitch with BPD, but still gets a boner from looking at her ass. 

Women subconsciously seek for and filter men based on outward signs. These signs can be faked


And this is why game works - PUA’s and jerks either understand and imitate


We can talk about love,” but I think any guy who can demonstrate to himself (and I think this is the eye-opening, TRP-is-true moment for most men) that more women are more attracted to him as a result of changing his behavior, literally overnight, to display these outward signs, regardless of his own underlying attributes, then all such illusions will be dispelled. Love, are conditional

This brings us to one of the major criticisms of game - that it is manipulative. In a sense, perfume, tight clothes, cosmetic surgery, and push-up bras are manipulative - both seek to influence unconscious attraction factors. 

For women, professional with access to resources. For men, wide hips, a thin waist, large breasts, etc, are all just markers for what we’re ultimately hardwired to seek - good mothers for our children. Game is male make-up. 

NAWALT means that all people get certain impulses or unconsciously respond to certain stimuli. Just like chicks can’t help but dig amused mastery

When TRP tells us “she's not a special snowflake

* understanding sexual relations and attraction as they really are

* demonstrating the above mentioned outward traits (this is Game)

* and finally, professional with resources), which are demonstrated by the outward traits described above, for my own sake

I want to change. I want to be a better woman. I respect a strong and dominant man and I feel most at home when I am following a good leader.

1374338020.0,1ip8pv,"From flirting to ""you've been degrading me all night""",harigeorgeson,62,26,43,"I went out with a friend last night and had a pretty bizarre experience that I thought was worth sharing.  What happened was essentially the polar opposite of what happened in my last post which can be found here.

[http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1i8ecj/girls_are_constantly_examining_your_frame_you/]

I reference my last post because my frame and general attitude were very similar during both of these interactions but the responses were wildly different.  I'll try to make it brief. 

I walk into a bar around midnight with a friend.  It's busy, relax, and talk to each other.  Next to us there is a group of 3 girls.  HB4, HB7, HB8.  I am closest to the HB4 and HB7.  I see them drinking beer out of a straw so I ask them what that's all about and tell them it's not ok.  The 4 loves it and offers to buy me a drink on the spot.  We talk more and exchange names. I introduce them to my friend. I didn't engage the HB8 at all and they didn't introduce me (this may be relevant later).

Anyway I do the usual push/pull.  The 7 tells me they met a guy earlier who looks just like me.  I say he must have been hot.  She smiles, local bars, guess each others ages, and have a decent conversation.  

At this point the HB4 goes home.  I go to the bathroom and tell my friend to talk to them while I'm gone.  Unfortunately he was shy and didn't talk to them at all.  I get back and talk to my friend about five feet away from the two girls who are now talking to each other.  I look over and see the HB7 who I had be talking to shoot me a look of anger and disgust.  I immediately say ""what was that for?"" She says she wasn't looking at me and was trying to see something outside.  

This is where it gets weird.  Sitting at the bar with them I finally try to introduce myself to the HB8.  She tells me her name in the most bitchy

The 8 says ""We both just got over a breakup and we're not interested.""  

I said ""What makes you think I'm interested?""

""You're talking to us.""

""I talk to everyone.  I enjoy talking to people.""

The HB7 says ""I don't like you.  You've been degrading me all night."" (we had been talking for 20 minutes)

I ask how and she couldn't give me any specific examples.  She just kept saying I was rude and degrading over and over again.  The only example she gave was that she went to take a sip of beer and picked up my glass by mistake and I corrected her.  I said ""that's my beer.""  This was her only example.  She said my whole vibe and the way I was looking at them was creepy.  (Again contrast with the last post)

As shocked as I was I sat as calmly and relaxed as I could at the bar. 

This seemed to upset them ever more as the HB8 said ""why are you still here?  we aren't interested. you need to leave.""  

I said ""I'm not interested either.  I'm going to sit here until I finish my beer.""

""You can finish it somewhere else.  It's a big bar.""

""You're right.  So can you.""

""If you don't leave we can go get the bouncer and tell him you're harassing us and he'll throw you out.""

""That's fine.""

I finished my beer and told them they would benefit from improving their social skills, I'm just surprised about how quickly things went from one extreme to the other.  Thoughts?

Informational background: Normal Kgirls wear high heels and miniskirts in the winter, they embrace their femininity and submissive roles (although many Kgirls can be fiesty and emotional). They like guys to take care of them; in fact, they *require* it. One quirk is that Kgirls will act really shy and innocent, when in fact they are slutty and are down to do stuff in bed no American girl would (because degrading!). In other words, many Kgirls got *game* and know what to do to attract guys. Although Kgirls are unique, I've been with many girls from Indonesia, Singapore, etc and the same is usually true; much more feminine without any feminist hangups. 

So onto my REAL topic: Korea has really become global the past few years. Tons of people are becoming obsessed with Korean culture (not to mention all of SE Asia already loves Kdramas, US, Canada, UK coming to Korea to teach English, study Korean, and just travel. Even 4 years ago, there were hardly any foreign girls; 9/10 foreigners here were guys while now it's like 50/50.

Basically, femininity and appearances. As a result, many complain &amp; Hamster about Kmen &amp; Western men. Then, my favorite: they shame Kwomen for loving cosmetics, beauty, and for being *too thin &amp; cute* (as if weighing &lt;120 lb is a crime). They are forced to start wearing leggings, heels, for the first time

Basically, relationships, work, etc. These are typically Canadians/Australians/American girls. 2) Women who have experience living as minorities, have healthy sexual attitudes, are open-minded, and most of all ***lack the typical feminist attitude that embracing femininity is a terrible/weak thing***. These are usually European/Eurasian girls. They are almost always thin, and are *super* open about sex. Both groups must adjust to Korean culture

For me, and **Sexual Market Value** are the heart of TRP.  These concepts alone can explain so much of sexual strategy.  Of course other concepts have been validated by real-world experience: White Knighting, Mate Selection, Shaming Tacticts used by women, Female Privilege, Hamstering, etc...  

I think a lot of the posts we see on here are related to tactics, SMV explains why people end up with the mates that they do, and hypergamy expands on why women act ""predictably irrational"".

* Experienced PUA has a successful system for sleeping with a lot of women.
* Predictably sleeps with a lot of women.

He refused to be subject to the decisions of others. He fought his own noble battle, even past the age most men have given up and retired. He created his own reality, and children and adults alike were drawn into his reality, and awarded him their undying love. TRP is not just about becoming a sex machine, or lashing out at real or imagined oppressors. TRP is acknowledging that a man does not react to the decisions of others, but acts

It ruined the nuclear family. Prior to the feminist revolution, now the government provides if the woman wants to be a single mother.

It ruined marriage as an institution
Each generation that came after the feminist revolution spawned more masculinized and less feminine women. How is this good? How is being more like a man good? WTF are women thinking?

It spawned today's generation of sluts that are unsuitable for marriage or raising a family. Today's American woman wants to fuck around with 100 guys before settling for a provider husband in her late 20s early 30s. WTF?!? How is this right? Then after that

Prior to the feminists coming around, and to work in whichever field they decided to specialize. All feminists did was fuck everything up. Every report or study I've seen clearly shows that women today are unhappier than they were in the 50s and 60s. I'll look a couple up if you're interested. Traditional gender roles are BIOLOGICAL, not imposed by society. If they were imposed by society, we wouldn't have found civilizations halfway across the world with the exact same gender roles we had in Europe in the middle ages and renaissance. Which were: men provide shelter and food, women rear the children and keep the home.

And the worst for last: since feminism told women they could fuck around, have a stable job, and he'd be basically guaranteed a wife he could have sex with all his life. Now these nice men don't have sex until their 30s when the sluts get tired of fucking around and are looking for a provider husband to rear the cost of her children. I hate feminists for this. I hate that I had to learn game to have sex. I'm great at game and have had 21 different girls over the past few years, but still I hate doing this to have sex because I know I'll never have a 100% stable girl I can settle down with. I hate that I can't have a wife and children without the fear of her taking all my money and my children away from me (which is the most likely scenario, I remind you).

Feminism has nothing to do with women's rights

**DLV** - Display of lower value.

**Feminism** –  ”A doctrine built on the pre-supposition of victimhood of women by men as a foundation of female identity. In its goals is always the utilization of the state to forcibly redress this claimed victimization. In other words, these two basic features are common to every doctrine using the label feminism.

**Game** – A loosely based set of behaviors specifically designed to increase attraction.

**Hypergamy** – The instinctual urge for women to seek out the best alpha available. This is marked by maximizing rejection (therefore women are the selective gender).

&gt;**Abstract:** Males tend to cooperate with physically attractive females without careful evaluation of their trustworthiness, identified only by photograph, who had decided in advance to exploit the male participants). The results show that trusting behaviour in male participants significantly increased in relation to the perceived attractiveness of the female partner, but that attractiveness did not impact trusting behaviour in the minocycline group.

**Introduction:**

This is normal

&gt; While these traits should be adaptive in terms of mate-choice

In other words, as they *will* screw us over.

So what's with this drug?

&gt;Recent studies with human subjects show that minocycline

Okay

&gt;Minocycline is also known to improve symptoms associated with psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and depression

Anyone else find it funny that the same drug used to inhibit the effects of both psychiatric disorders is also effective in protecting against the ""honeytrap""? No wonder husbands say that their wives drive them crazy! 

**Method**: Here's a [flowchart of the ""economic game"" they played.](http://imgur.com/8SSVPdG). Very easy to understand.

**Results**: [Bar graph of the results](http://imgur.com/8TefVI2)

&gt; * Placebo and Minocycline groups gave the same amount of money to the non attractive female

&gt; * Placebo group gave larger amounts of money when the partner was more attractive

&gt; * Minocycline group did NOT give more money when the partner was more attractive

**Conclusion**:

The authors mainly focuse on Minocycline as a drug and it's usefulness in the future. 

But I think the RP lining in this study is that the *same* drug that improves schizophrenic symptoms *also* was shown to improve resistance to irrational thinking and the ""honeytrap"". If our brains process both of these the same way

This is my word-for-word response to her latest [response](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1e58ta/im_a_f_who_just_got_out_of_a_shitty_relationship/c9yiog4) to me:

&gt; I've decided that you are an asshole

That's fine. You're still very unattractive.

&gt; If I feel like a 7 or an 8 then I am

If I feel I look like Ryan Gosling -- I DO!

&gt; I don't need you to validate how I feel or make me feel worse than I am

You came on the internet looking for validation. If you found any -- you DON'T deserve it. Besdies

&gt; I'm obviously not your type

Or the type of 95+% of other men who know you're the bottom rung of what they can get

&gt; I don't know what you are working with

The girls love my personality. Where I work I am asked all the time how I am able to talk with so many attractive girls and have them always coming back for more. And I'm talking real 7's

&gt; That being said

You need to improve your appearance to improve your results. I gave you an honest assessment of your photos (that you provided and asked for an assessment) and you didn't like what I had to say. You're a broken women and like Humpty Dumpty -- nobody wants to put you back together again. Especially men. Especially

&gt; I just got out of an emotionally

But that is no reason to delusionally inflate your ego because you claim you were a victim. I don't know if you're telling the truth about your previous relationship (as most women outright lie or really exaggerate the severity) but I can ask you one question -- Why did you stay in an abusive relationship for so long? I don't feel much sympathy for you knowing you could have left but didn't. They say the door to abusive relationships is locked from the inside.

&gt; So the last thing I need is someone like you judging me.

You asked us to when YOU provided photos to do so. So don't blame me for granting your wish

&gt; I do alright and the people I like and care about find me attractive.

Then bang them

&gt; They like my tattoos and they don't say sexist

Please show me where I made one sexist remark. To you (and 99% of women who have been brainwashed by modern feminism) anything that is said that is in any way critical of you is sexism? Criticism about you (and not your gender) is not sexism

&gt; You are the reason I prefer imgur to reddit and you are the reason I can't take people seriously online

Online or offline -- we men all feel the same. You are unattractive and don't deserve the caliber of men you desire. Lower your standards because a majority of men will need to do likewise if they choose to bang you

1367693466.0,1dovmp,[Mod] State Of The Subreddit May 2013,redpillschool,59,24,25,"Well Red Pillers

Since we're growing at such a fast rate

I would like to take this moment to address the stance the moderators have on a few topics- and the direction we intend on steering this subreddit for the foreseeable future.

Spousal Rape
-----------

A commonly repeated trope is that we support rape because one of our moderators said ""I don't believe in spousal rape."" I will only address this once.

Any forcible exertion of will over somebody else's will is clearly wrong. Bodily autonomy should always be respected, and not one dismissing basic human rights. **Nobody here advocates denying anybody else's autonomy, not even our moderators.**

As rape is being defined as wrong because it denies the basic human right of agency

Any force that requires a man

Therefore we will refer to alimony as divorce-rape

If we accept that not all exertion of will over somebody else's autonomy is wrong

This will be the last time I address this: If we revisit the definitions

Any attempts to conflate the two will be immediately removed and banned. It is a disservice and insult to victims who have actually suffered the terrible tragedy of rape.

Trolls
----------

With the influx of new users

Posts that utilize any kind of concern or shaming language are immediately suspect. We will take a look at each post on a base-by-case basis. Typical phrases that we will be looking out for include:

* ""I feel so bad

* ""You're bitter."" 

* ""Misogynist"" 

* ""You all...""

Please note, and not ad hominem attacks or concern for our well being. 

A new trend that we have been seeing recently are the passive aggressive trolls that disguise themselves with plausible deniability. They attempt to cloud their true purpose by representing themselves as honestly inquisitive or perhaps genuinely mislead, or insults to our moderators.

It is very possible to be here and ask questions

* Leading with a presumptive conclusion. ""The fact that you're bitter is getting in the way of..""

* Asking complex questions (fallacious questions) to which any answer is an endorsement to a presupposition that has not been determined or agreed upon. ""Can anybody tell me why you guys hate women so much?""

* Ad hominem ""just because you are bitter..""

* Condescension ""This just seems like a bunch of chest beating to me..""

* Unfalsifiable rhetoric - phrases

* Concern ""I feel like this sub is focusing too much on.."" (If you are genuinely concerned

* Accusations of echo chamber/circle jerk. This is a combination of just about all of the above

* Insulting the moderators - If you disagree with a moderator, and we spend a lot of time learning every day. However, if you show disrespect to the moderators by using ad hominem attacks or thinly disguise an insult as a ""genuine"" disagreement, you will be banned. 


If you feel you were unjustly caught we have no issue looking at appeals on a case by case basis

Our moderators do a lot of work to keep our sub clean and functioning on a daily basis, and attempting to discuss solid red pill theory. Please do not make our jobs harder.",Meta,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,,
1367051992.0,1d7i11,How are female bursts of outrage tolerated?,MustNotFfff,54,16,62,"I just saw this thread on Reddit - [1] http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1d6wvf/she_posted_this_facebook_her_bf_cheated_on_her_so/ - and it just reminded me again that women get to get away with some ridiculous shit. If a woman determines that her husband is a cheating scumbag or such

And this is a recurring phenomenon. I personally recall a situation where the mother of one of my friend's mom pulled something comparable in nature. This mother insisted that my friend and his stepdad go and sell some worthless crap in a garage sale, because it was too long ago. What I do remember, however, was seeing that woman throw all that stuff from one room into the corridor in the most ostentatious manner possible. [Useless, abandoned] things were breaking, sparks were flying, major drama was had. All because that woman was not willing to do that shit herself (while her husband and son were rightfully in favor of throwing away that worthless stuff

At least in that case, can you even imagine a guy pulling that kind of ****? Can you imagine having a temper tantrum because someone did not handle a situation precisely in the way you felt was ideal? Or can you imagine a guy going and trashing his girlfriend's apartment because she cheated on him?

I feel like women are just institutionally encouraged to do whatever they please and with no consequences. Things that would get a man's ass kicked so bad

1374596775.0,1iw4qb,3 ways to keep your motivation to stick with the gym.,ANAL_PRO_LAPS,52,19,66,"I'm glad things have been focused on fitness here lately, etc).

**Disclaimer** My weight before working out was 140lbs at 5'11"". Just to be clear I'm not at my goal weight yet, but I still think I can write this now. My best lifts (@165lbs) were a 475lb deadlift, 255lb bench, and 345lb high-bar squat (I don't like low-bar). Currently I'm into olympic weightlifting.

I've been into fitness for a while, I'm going crazy in the gym every day and it feels great.

----------------------------------------------
One thing I've seen from many people is they lack the motivation to keep going to the gym. Everyone should have their own reasons for staying motivated

* **Focus on beating Personal Records**

Nothing feels better during a gym session than breaking a PR. You get an adrenaline rush, along with breaking PRs, the muscular gains just become a side effect, rather than the goal. Find me one guy who can deadlift 600+ lbs that doesn't look great (unless they are 20% body fat) 

* **Have a big mirror in your bathroom/room or somewhere you can admire your body's progress**

This may sound shallow

* **Compete**

Competition: The great motivator. For people who are trying to pack on muscle

- Bodybuilding
- Powerlifting
- Olympic Weightlifting
- Strongman (a bit harder to find)

These are great because there's hard deadlines for competitions, and you want to make sure you put on a good performance. The people I know who are the most fit and most obsessed with keeping in shape all compete.

-----------------------------------------------------

Playing off the competing for motivation bit, the best routes a man should take for packing on muscle quickly and actually getting some real size.

Some areas of exercise that probably won't give you decent muscle:

- Jogging (lol)
- Marathons
- Cycling
- Triathlons 
- Rock climbing (although rock climbing is really cool)
- Yoga
- Pilates
- Any type of aerobics

The Red Pill is Misogyny
-------------------------

False. I'm going to break this answer into two parts.

**Part One**

There is no systemic hatred of women here. The red pill is a subreddit dedicated to helping men find the truth regarding inter-gender relations. The sad truth is

Finding love isn't an unreasonable goal, tv), the ones their mothers and fathers advocated, they actually work against them if they are to find a mate. It actually makes them unsuccessful.

Of course upon hearing the reality of what it is that makes some men successful with women, she'll be disgusted at the very concept... *it must be wrong!*

But nevertheless, and putting them into practice on the field, and getting real results.

We call learning and internalizing the red pill ""swallowing the pill"" or ""unplugging."" Yes, it pulls the proverbial carpet from underneath your feet. Everything you believed about society, marriage, relationships, women, it's all wrong. You've been lied to.

It's a very difficult transition between being plugged in and really understanding the concepts here. Often this transition is met with anger. This is a normal step in the transition.

*Why would people lie to me? Why would mom lie to me? Why would my girlfriend lie to me? Why would society lie to me?*

This stage usually doesn't last too long, and system that has propagated lies. And rightfully so. I believe anger is an important step. It's the first real step in taking control of one's own life and understanding happiness is yours to take if you want it.

But this is not to be confused with a systemic hatred of women. While these men may curse god and all that live on this planet, ""how can women do something like XYZ??"" It is an expression of anger a perceived injustice.

Our critics would like to paint this anger as hatred. It's a temporary anger, and the red pill changes everything we know.

When men begin to realize that their goals are unrealistic, and why they are told.

This transforms anger into something constructive: understanding and setting new goals. With new goals

This is not the systemic hatred of women. This is introspection and understanding

Now, we analyze the public face on their strategies, the rationalizations they make for their actions that they readily admit to on threads in askwomen or relationships. This does not constitute hatred, and anybody trying to conflate the two is disingenuous and flatly wrong. Critique and hatred are two very different things. 

**Part Two**

The term misogyny is a thought terminating cliche. We disallow it's usage in any way that isn't' strictly ironic on our sub because the term itself is terribly meaningless and serves no other purpose but to attach a negative stigma to a very real experience these men are having. The term itself is part of what we refer to as the feminine imperative

The very act of discussing ideas that are different or not specifically politically correct is what draws this fire, the term ""misogyny"" rears its ugly head. It's an emotional trick, to try to stigmatise our subreddit- and it always points to one logical conclusion: If there were a solid logical argument against the red pill, would opponents not rather use those instead of cheap tricks like the word ""misogyny?""

Usage of the word misogyny accomplishes precisely the goal of those using it, to ensure arguments are not heard over the cries of ""misogyny."" Any who attempt to defend it be wary, as they themselves will associate with said misogyny, and themselves risk the label misogynist. Instead of having to reason on merit,  they declare evil the very debate itself. An effective tool to silence people. Except, of course, not any more

My suggestion: Couchsurfing. For those who don't know, or ""surfers"", who stay at your house. It promotes cultural exchange, gives you a free place to stay, and a free guide (and save $$$). You make a profile and can either ""host"" or ""surf"" or go to ""CS meetings"" where you can meet new girls who are traveling. 

This is all within the context of ""CS community"". This is SUPER important as that very fact lowers the ""bitch walls"" of many girls. You're just a cool

Why does it work? Truth: traveling girls are down to fuck. Hostels are cesspools of hookups and sex if you have ever traveled that way. CS is the same way. You get the ""foreign country effect"" (sexual inhibitions are always lowered while traveling because girls' sense of self-accountability is way off; she can act like a new person and no one will ever know). Also

In my experience, I get a great mix of different nationalities since I live in a huge Asian city and lots of tourists come through here.

So, going to meetings is simply a great way to dominate the local betas who are also looking for hookups. For me, almost every meeting I go to, I end up with a girl. And I have 32 positive reviews, and 25 are girls I've banged.

tl;dr Try Couchsurfing. If you have ever heard ""CS is not a dating site""

We don't subscribe to typical gender assigned roles of the relationship so I don't feel it's above me in the least to do dishes

Through out talks and readings together I have seen the destruction that can come from men using male privilege to try to dominate and control women putting them in cages and prevent them from reaching true self actualization and fulfillment.   Parts of this are incorporated in our daily morning mantra.

Now on to some issues.  I'm asking for help with two issues.  The first is with America's predefined standards of beauty and what is considered attractive.  My girl and I are looking to spice things up a bit with some exotic eveningwear and we recently took a trip to Victoria's Secret to find some sexy undergarments.  

While we were both delighted with some of the fragrances available to the discerning provocateur

I want to discuss an aspect of my Courtney's life that has recently visited some trouble upon my soul.   Courtney has met some new guy friends recently on the subway.  A diverse group of inner city fellas that are local aspiring rappers and she likes to hang with them sometimes late nights and weekends.  

I'm happy for her and encourage her to maintain many types of friendship to help in her life journey of self discovery. Again

I'm not nosy but we've had some discussion of what she does when she hangs out with her guy friends during one of our share/care talks.  She says they often like to just hang out and watch and smoke a little bit of weed while they kick some rhymes.  

I'm all for the idea of her expanding her musical horizons and enjoying the poetry and prose of these local street talents but I have a problem with some of the lyrical content.   She recently brought home a demo CD and I gave it a listen. 

I believe firmly in the idea of a compliment sandwich so I'll start with some positives.  The beats are nice.   It's actually a bit reminiscent of Timberlands earlier stuff with Missy Elliot ...but I digress.  My ~~problem~~ concern is with some lyrical content.  

Their raps consists mostly of the ol male patriarchy archetypical content found in some rap today that is degrading to women and filled with braggadocio and tales of sexual conquest without much regard for for monogamy or fidelity.  A couple lines that stuck in my brain.  ""Come get some

This was an emotional moment for me and I called for one of our sit downs.  When it was my turn with the talking pillow

I trust what she's saying.  No problem there.  But I feel the desire to contribute with an example of some more positive ""phat rhymes"" that will highlight women in a more respectful manner and perhaps accentuate the pros of monogamy and marriage.     This type of thing is maybe not typical for this sub-reddit but I'm challenging you to help me.  Thanks so much.

Who would've thought in two short months we’d be at a thousand readers?


As we grow


Every time I see a discussion denouncing our viewpoint I notice they all have something in common: They all mischaracterize our standpoint and rally the troops against it. 


It’s easier for them to characterize us as rapists than for them to develop a coherent argument against our viewpoint. There’s a reason for that. Because there is no argument against us. There is only truth and that which fails the truth test. We already dismiss the lies.


How much denial must one embrace to assume that we’re just an outlier group of misfits that don’t understand women? We’re growing, men wouldn't stumble upon our group and think, “wow, these guys describe everything that’s happened in my life…”


We’re at a thousand members now. And that’s two months. Consider that. Think about it.


We’re not a hate group. We’re not violent. We’re not rapists. We’re just men. Doing what men have always done.  And you don’t have to like it. Because all the other women *love it*. 


We don’t care if you understand. We think you shouldn't

**You reward men who won’t be attentive.**

All right guys there is a lot to be said about this video from a Red Pill perspective.

Lets start with indisputable facts:

The Teen Choice award live audience demographics is predominantly females 20 to 25. I know this because iv actually gone.

Ashton Kutcher isnt just an attractive actor

Ashton Kutcher has extensive experience in entertainment and has a firm understanding of how the industry works.

**Analysis:** When Ashton walks on stage he knows that the Teen Choice Award is bullshit

**My real Name is Chris**: Being a celebrity makes you a fetish object. Ashton begs the audience to listen to him he wants them to know that he is human just like them and begs for them to connect and listen to him on a person to person level.

**Opportunity is hard work:** This is an indirect attack on female entitlement. Ashton talks about how he used to work menial jobs and how hard work breeds success. A concept lost on this entitled generation.

**Sexy is being a well rounded adult:** Ashton attacks the entertainment industry for pushing consumerism. All a woman needs to be desirable to men is a good brain and a good heart

**Life is made up by people no smarter than you:** Challenge norms push boundries life is what you make it. Don't let others make rules for you.

Chris wants the audience to snap out of it and see the world for what it really is. The chances of this happening is zero unfortunately these women are going to clap retardedly and fantasize about having sex with Ashton. No one gives a fuck about what Chris has to say.

These are twenty year old women and they cant see the man all they can see is his status. These women's inability to connect with the man makes them something less:

Out recently with a few friends, but he rejects most of my advice and is happy with low hanging fruit from OKC and letting me do the opening.  One of the others is married and the other is getting married in November.

We hit a local bar for some food, I love lesbians.

Somehow we got onto some TRP topics, I was out with his fiancée two weeks before, nothing happened beyond sexy dancing.

 At some point a lovely blonde (claire, which he refused to do so, sarcastically responding ""why don't you use your awesome powers"".

As we were all going out for a smoke, and she suggested I join her and her mother (the older lady with her) for a drink when I came back from my smoke.

When we returned I noticed there was a guy sitting at their table across from them, so I figured he was no one important.

As I walked to their table

She introduces me to her mum, and her mum is reaching over to also initiate some touching. The other guy was pretty much out the conversation as soon as I sat down and left, I didn't notice when.

After about 20mins, I offer my arm, which she accepts and as we walk out I let it drop and take her hand, which she squeezes.

As soon as we are outside I spin her into me and k-closed her.  After a few mins I pull back, he wants her to move back in, but she likes living on her own.  We kiss a few more times between her moaning about her boyfriend and me calling her a terrible person.  It's closing time in the bar, so her mother joins us, as they head home.  I never #-closed her as she lives across from the bar, and I said I would see her around.

My wing and I head to a club, from our work.  She has a boyfriend, but her and my wing have kissed a few times drunk.  I've turned her down numerous times and used her as a wing women.  She has 4 pals with her, one I'm crazy about, who endlessly flirts with me but has a boyfriend, one that I know fairly well but not interested in and two I've never meet before. One is a black chick called Sabrina, easy 9.  We say hello and leave them to it.

Wing and I dance a little, #-closes and a slap or two, while he hangs around with the first set I opened.  His game is so slow and awkward, it's painful to watch.

I spot Jill and friends sitting down, Sabrina asks me to get rid off, so I nice guy him out and he leaves.  We hit it off instantly, lots of kino, heavy eye contact, whispering in each others ears and creating inside jokes. Things are going well. We head in to dance, and I pull the usually arm to hand holding trick.

On the dance floor I'm dancing with them all, etc.  At some point Sabrina isolates me and pulls me onto her so her ass in my crotch and starts to grind it.  I figure this is as good a time as any for the k-close, so I soon her round and k-close.  During the dancing I have been holding a can of beer, and out of no where Jill smashes into us, sending my beer flying.

I turn to say ""wtf"" and she cuts me off by yelling ""Someone with a face like yours has no right to flirt with girls the way you do."" And proceeds give me shit for hitting on her friends, etc.

At first I thought she was playing around, continuing to call me names and curse me out.  When it became clear she was not going to stop, I walked away, got my jacket and left the club.  Unfortunately she completely broke my frame, and I wasn't up to doing any post-club street game.

I'm currently living with my brother in a small apartment in a suburb of Dallas. Let's call him Drew. Both Drew and I are similar in a lot of ways. We share common interests and hobbies. He has the worst taste in women and got burned because of it. Because he's well educated and is pretty rational in general, mostly). But in general, he's a blue pill factory.

Drew met his current girlfriend online through a dating site and they jumped headlong into an LTR. They probably had about two dates before they moved into the LTR.

For financial reasons, rent free. In exchange for rent, her duties included keeping the common areas clean and cooking semi-regularly so I don't have to when I get home from work (my income and his unemployment make it possible to live where we do).

Generally speaking, and went on with my life.

I get home from work and I can hear shouting from our apartment. Its pretty late as I have a long commute

They're standing in the living room going at it like George Foreman and Muhammad Ali. Because my memory isn't that good and I can't remember what they said exactly

But I didn't write this to describe the first bit of the conversation. The worst part was when my brother said ""If you won't cook

Shit hit the fan.

In no time flat she was on the floor (literally), so she was forced to. I did my best ""who, me?"", went into my room, and locked the door.

The next morning my brother told me that after I left, she would be gone. He agreed.

If you've read the sidebar material then you know modern day dating is a trap. Sure, and feeling rather hopeless about the situation. 

Luckily

This is why I cannot preach enough to new followers of TRP to find something you are passionate about. There are too many of us, but you'll be much happier in general. Every morning becomes a challenge you look forward to taking on as opposed to the enslavement of doing something you hate strictly for money.

Don't know what you're passionate about? Make finding out your passion your passion. Try new things, however, pushing towards a lifestyle that you want is one of the greatest journeys a man can take. It doesn't happen overnight and, if you're lucky, you may realize that the journey itself is the reward.

On a completely unrelated side note, but slut shaming is still a reactive behaviour. Real men act, they don't react.

I'm a student of TRP seeking advice on how to best respond to a girl (we'll call her M) who's trying to pull the LJBF line. M is a very attractive girl and thats largely why I pursued her when I was still a blue pill. Among my cringeworthy mistakes was allowing my emotions to get the better of me; I told M guarded secrets about myself, I was crushed and her question, ""can we still be friends?"" seemed innocuous. Foolishly, I said yes. In retrospect, I've realized that I dodged a bullet with my own incompetence; M is emotional, impulsive, indecisive

Since then (8 months ago) I've entered grad school and used the transition as an opportunity to improve myself (clothing, learning RP theory, etc). Applying the Red Pill is like seeing the power of realpolitik in a market full of idealists!

Anyway, so I anticipate that she'll want some explanation for why I'm not speaking to her. I realize that she is simply seeking attention and favours from an orbiting beta, but I've decided that I'm not interested in playing along with the LJBF game. She's just not worth keeping around when there so many dateable women, and its not like I would keep her around for intellectually stimulating conversations. In short, I stand to gain nothing from this ""friendship"" while she looks for attention and favours.

Now the reason I put these up (not tooting my own horn, we are all animals, civilized animals.  We can create skyscrapers, build nukes, fly planes, yet deep down, there is that subconscious that we still strive to understand. 

In TRP, I have seen alot of ideas and some ""growth"" to these ideas, leading to new ones, one of which I am proposing today.

We, in 2013.  However, these issues have existed since man has existed.  Instead, we are putting words to these issues, giving them light, and most importantly, comprehending them.  

These two links I put up brought to light something very important.  The perpetrators of the issues that we, are not just women.  Its EVERYONE.

Kids will shit test you, people won't want to be your friend if you don't pass their shit tests, women won't want to fuck you if you don't pass their shit tests.  Men and women BOTH hamster (or rationalize), who does it more is another question.  

Now, identify, and EXPAND the ideals of TRP into more than just sexual strategy.  This is about life, primal, unadulterated, pure, animalistic, but we still maintain these concepts like ""shit tests"" to see who is better than who

TRP is all about becoming a man.  This man must be a leader, not take anyone's shit, and will let you go at the drop of a hat in order to ensure his own survival.  This may seem selfish but remember, the only person responsible for your own actions is you.  People will do mind boggling, eye opening things just to ensure their own survival.  So just remember how selfish other people can be, and how they could easily leave you in the dust when it comes to saving their own skin.  But also use good judgment too and make sure your actions are justified.  The ideas of being a leader to everyone, not just women, but I

Basically, and possibly in this subreddit, we can talk more about growing as men, and more importantly focusing on what social concepts we encounter in everyday life that affect our survival and our standing in society, instead of focusing on JUST women.  In a sense, climbing to the top of the proverbial ladder and staying there.  By being a leader to everyone, we assert our social dominance over everyone

It was a Tuesday evening, and if you know Edinburgh, you will know this is one of the most popular places for tourists as it leads to the castle.

I get us to sit at a table next to the main entrance so I can keep an eye on who comes in.  After a few drinks I head out for a smoke.  While standing outside, she holds it while she walks past me, turning her head to maintain it as they enter the bar.  Intriguing.

I enter the venue and notice them standing at the bar, a male/female set of tourists usually end up being boyfriend/girlfriend (which can go interesting, I have banged a girl who was on holiday with her boyfriend because she really wanted to sleep with someone from Scotland).  I join into my friends conversation, keeping an eye on her and making faces at her when we make strong eye contact, she smiles or laughs.

About 15 mins pass, he tries to drag her away from the bar.  After a few minutes of this, he storms out the bar.  Game on.

I head out for a smoke, plans out, legs apart, and she is eye fucking me the entire time I am walking to my friends.  I stand at my group:

""Guys

I get the orders and then tell them ""Look, so can you keep her company for me?""

I head to the bar and stand next to her with her on my right, her left side is pointed towards the bar.  I turn to her:

""Hi"" in a thick accent

""Tourist?""

""Yes

""No

""Haha"" touches my arm ""Are they that bad?""

""I am here with my brother

""Is that right?""

""Yes

""Seen much of the city?""

""Yes

""Wearing your terrible shoes""

Laughing ""Yes

At this point the barman has finished pours mt drinks ""Grab those beers for me

I grab two of the drinks and walk off

""Wait here

She laughs and nods and I head to the toilet.

As I return, knees pointed towards me, legs apart.

I start discussing her plans for her trip, making sure to bring in emotional phrases.

""It's amazing walking up some of the hills here

We discuss clubbing, her hands are either on my thigh, or in my hands and her eye contact is pretty much constant.  After about 20 mins or so she starts talking about how she has to have an early night because they are leaving early in the morning.  I take this as a signal to move things along.

I tell her I am going out for a smoke, I pull her into me and kiss her.

After a few minutes we stop

""I can't

""You don't strike me as a person who ever behaves""

""Ha

""You shouldn't smoke

""I know

It didn't make any sense to not be as nice as possible to a girl, the first I ever had (my looks department began to mature and I actually looked like a man).  One relationship lasted a month

Pathetic, she looked like a very young Sela Ward.  I was extremely attracted to her because she was the most feminine girl I'd ever had a chance to hang out with (I had never really appreciated a very feminine girl until I met her, I was attracted to athletic girls primarily) and we had a ton in common, everything from humor to comfort food.  The first, and only, week we were together was stellar, I had never experienced being totally infatuated with someone before and her infatuated with me.  The sad thing was the first, week we were together we were separated because it was spring break.  We spent hours, I couldn't stop thinking about her, I was in complete and utter disbelief.  It didn't feel real

It wasn't until I started to read red pill stuff that things began to make sense.  I smothered her in Beta.  I had written her several extremely beta love letters on facebook, like practically worshiping her because I liked her so much and she was giving me attention I had never had.  Before the red pill, I had no idea how much of a turn off those actions would be.  Had I known game, I might possibly still be with her today and kept her attracted to me, but that's oneitis speaking (she still invades my dreams now and then, which is annoying as hell).  It's so obvious once you realize it, that pedestalization of a woman is relationship suicide, it is up to the red pill community

My story ends well in the present.  I met and married a woman who is very feminine and athletic and we've been very happy together for several years.  I know how to keep her attraction, and turned off when I act like a boy, and it feels goddamn good to finally have some sense of control over my life.  I am also not worried about losing my wife, not because I'm some cold hearted asshole who doesn't love his wife, but if she ever leaves or dies I know I can get another woman.  It is very liberating for any beta male to know that he has a plan, a base of knowledge, on how to get other women should his current one fail.  To be honest, but that's the risk you take when you get married, even among the Christians).

I feel like it would be good to have some quality (non-""game"" themed"" books that illustrate and inform on understanding TRP.  So please

Here are a few that I've liked:

Meditations by Marcus Aurelius----Philosophical book about ""stoicism"" and finding meaning in yourself even when faced with uncertain events.

Anything by Thomas Sowell.  This guy is a genius.  He writes on a variety of topics including economics, the ""isms"", and much much more.  His works are very informative yet very easy to understand.  He is def. NOT PC...he tells it like it is and he backs it all up with data.  I really like ""A Conflict of Visions"", ""Intellectuals and Society"", ""Economic Facts and Fallacies"", ""Every Wonder Why?"", and a whole lot of his other works as well.  A good place to start would be with ""The Thomas Sowell Reader"".  It's a collection of articles from a lot of his works and gives a very broad and encompassing look at all types of issues that are at play with TRP.  

Rhetoric by Aristotle---This is the book, the fallacies used in arguments, and how you can become more persuasive.  Also, like many older/ancient books, you can get them for free online.  This book, and others based on it, can REALLY help you see things from a logical standpoint and quickly identify bullshit arguments/statements.  

The Virtue of Selfishness by Ayn Rand----Some people like her, there would be less burden on others to do so, and we'd live better, more meaningful lives.  This is a quick read and I feel it really applies to TRP b/c it's about how striving for your own happiness IS actually a good thing.  

Thus Spoke Zarathustra or other works by Friedrich Nietzsche---His works have strong themes of becoming what you want, the ""Master-Slave morality"" (From On the Genealogy of Morality.  This is very relevant to true unplugged human behavior)

The Road to Serfdom by F.A. Hayek----This book pretty plainly spells out the dangers of collectivism and collectivist thought.  It highlights the disdain for the individual at the behest of the collective.  

Economics in One Lesson by Henry Hazlitt----Pretty short, aside from all the bullshit you'll hear on TV, major newspapers, etc.  Hazlitt and Hayek were colleagues.  

The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and F. Engels----I would include this book

Rules for Radicals by Saul Alinsky----A lot of these rules are being used against people everyday and they don't know it.  If one can identify the tactics

My background is in politics/philosophy

I'm a US Marine and I consider myself an Alpha. I've been married for 2 years now and it seems I'm fighting a losing battle with my marriage. I have always been the sole provider and I trust my wife to take care of things at home e.g. cook and clean

Over the course of these 2 years I've experienced what felt like is her relegating my role as a Marine and husband from being an Alpha male at home to more of a beta. When we first met I believed she was attracted to me because of my assertiveness and the control I just assumed over our relationship

It's like I'm being marginalized by her. Working on my bike or my car in the garage is a ""waste"" to her and I spend too much time using the computer rather than watching TV with her. And the things I used to do to help her out have become more of a responsibility rather than a polite gesture. The only guilt-free  time I get to myself is at the gym. 



Is my wife turning me into a beta? and how can I fucking change this??

1367346526.0,1dfd3x,Philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer: On Women,ubercoolhipsterguy,65,33,19,"Full text: http://www.theabsolute.net/misogyny/onwomen.html

""Women are directly adapted to act as the nurses and educators of our early childhood, and short-sighted—in a word, are big children all their lives, something intermediate between the child and the man**, who is a man in the strict sense of the word. Consider how a young girl will toy day after day with a child, dance with it and sing to it; and then consider what a man, with the very best intentions in the world

""With girls, fulness of charm at the expense of the rest of their lives; so that they may during these years ensnare the fantasy of a man to such a degree as to make him rush into taking the honourable care of them, in some kind of form, for a lifetime—a step which would not seem sufficiently justified if he only considered the matter**.  Accordingly, **Nature has furnished woman, as she has the rest of her creatures, with the weapons and implements necessary for the protection of her existence and for just the length of time that they will be of service to her**; so that Nature has proceeded here with her usual economy. Just as the female ant after coition loses her wings, nay

Man reaches the maturity of his reasoning and mental faculties scarcely before he is eight-and-twenty; woman when she is eighteen; but hers is reason of very narrow limitations. This is why women remain children all their lives, take the appearance of a thing for reality, and prefer trifling matters to the most important**. It is by virtue of man’s reasoning powers that he does not live in the present only, like the brute, but observes and ponders over the past and future; and from this spring discretion, care, and that anxiety which we so frequently notice in people. The advantages, that this entails, she is intellectually short-sighted, affects women in a less degree than men. This is why they have greater inclination for extravagance

**So that it will be found that the fundamental fault in the character of women is that they have no “sense of justice.**” This arises from their deficiency in the power of reasoning already referred to, as the weaker sex, to be dependent on strength but on cunning; this is why they are instinctively crafty, and have an ineradicable tendency to lie.** For as lions are furnished with claws and teeth, elephants with tusks, boars with fangs, bulls with horns, inky fluid, it is as natural for women to dissemble at every opportunity as it is for those animals to turn to their weapons when they are attacked; and they feel in doing so that in a certain measure they are only making use of their rights. Therefore a woman who is perfectly truthful and does not dissemble is perhaps an impossibility. **This is why they see through dissimulation in others so easily; therefore it is not advisable to attempt it with them.** From the fundamental defect that has been stated, treachery

**Nature has made it the calling of the young, and **it finds its expression in the passions of women**. **This law surpasses all others in both age and power.** **Woe then to the man who sets up rights and interests in such a way as to make them stand in the way of it; for whatever he may do or say, they will, at the first significant onset, be unmercifully annihilated.** For the secret, unformulated, nay, because they care a little for us, have been put into our hands and entrusted to our care through the medium of the next generation which proceeds from us; let us fulfil our duties conscientiously.

But women are by no means conscious of this leading principle in abstracto, for in the darkest depths of their hearts they are conscious that in violating their duty towards the individual they have all the better fulfilled it towards the species**, whose claim upon them is infinitely greater. 

Because women in truth exist entirely for the propagation of the race, and in their hearts take the affairs of the species more seriously than those of the individual. This gives to their whole being and character a certain frivolousness**, and altogether a certain tendency which is fundamentally different from that of man; and this it is which develops that discord in married life which is so prevalent and almost the normal state.

It is natural for a feeling of mere indifference to exist between men, but with women embraces the whole sex; since they have only one kind of business. **Even when they meet in the street, they look at each other like Guelphs and Ghibellines**. And it is quite evident when two women first make each other’s acquaintance that they exhibit more constraint and dissimulation than two men placed in similar circumstances. This is why an exchange of compliments between two women is much more ridiculous than between two men. Further, while a man will, as a rule, address others, even those inferior to himself, **it is unbearable to see how proudly and disdainfully a lady of rank will, or because while a hundred things must be weighed in our case, because of the one-sided nature of their vocation they stand in closer relationship to each other than men do; and so it is they try to render prominent the differences of rank.

**It is only the man whose intellect is clouded by his sexual instinct that could give that stunted, and short-legged race the name of the fair sex; for the entire beauty of the sex is based on this instinct.** One would be more justified in calling them the unaesthetic sex than the beautiful. Neither for music, nor for poetry, nor for fine art have they any real or true sense and susceptibility, and it is mere mockery on their part, in their desire to please, if they affect any such thing.

This makes them incapable of taking a purely objective interest in anything, as follows. **A man strives to get direct mastery over things either by understanding them or by compulsion**. But a woman is always and everywhere driven to indirect mastery, namely through a man; all her direct mastery being limited to him alone. Therefore it lies in woman’s nature to look upon everything only as a means for winning man, and her interest in anything else is always a simulated one, a mere roundabout way to gain her ends, consisting of coquetry and pretence. Hence Rousseau said, Les femmes, n’aiment aucun art, or the play; the childish simplicity

Nothing different can be expected of women if it is borne in mind that the **most eminent of the whole sex have never accomplished anything in the fine arts that is really great, or given to the world any kind of work of permanent value**. This is most striking in regard to painting, the technique of which is as much within their reach as within ours; this is why they pursue it so industriously. Still, **they have not a single great painting to show, for the simple reason that they lack that objectivity of mind which is precisely what is so directly necessary in painting**. **They always stick to what is subjective**. For this reason, ordinary women have no susceptibility for painting at all: for natura non facet saltum. And Huarte, in his book which has been famous for three hundred years, contends that women do not possess the higher capacities. Individual and partial exceptions do not alter the matter; women are and remain, to which they give the tone and where they have sway, Chamfort says very truly: Elles sont faites pour commercer avec nos faiblesses avec notre folie

**In the West,” finds herself in a fausse position**; for woman, rightly named by the ancients sexus sequior, **is by no means fit to be the object of our honour and veneration**, or to hold her head higher than man and to have the same rights as he. The consequences of this fausse position are sufficiently clear. Accordingly, it would be a very desirable thing if this Number Two of the human race in Europe were assigned her natural position, and the lady-grievance got rid of, but would have been equally ridiculed by Greece and Rome. The result of this would be that the condition of our social, is a creature who should not exist at all; but there ought to be housekeepers, the greater majority of the sex

While reading this subreddit, such as for example I think women who are never willing to have sex and then get dumped shouldn't complain, because sometimes relationships involve doing things you don't want for the sake of the other person. But I'm not here to ask about the stuff I agree with.

One: do you believe that there are exceptions to the generalities about women? I see a lot about hypergamy, and the degree I am working on (computer science) is one that will give me as much money as I need. I don't need excessively extravagant material items. I've always been glad that I won't need to burden someone with supporting me, and thought it was a 'plus'. There are guys in my class that I would date, and I'd also 'date down'. I have no desire to be an over-controlling or nagging girlfriend (that type of thing is just annoying), and on that matter I like a guy who is confident and decisive enough to assert himself and do his own thing. I just don't really want to be 'the submissive one'. Compromise is part of the relationship but I'd feel useless and like a burden for letting someone else be in charge of me or treat me like a teenager.

Two: I often see it mentioned that women do not have the same capability for achievement as men. I think, but do you think it is impossible for women to be on some sort of higher level, even if it's rarer? I've always thought that life without the possibility of achievement would be fairly pointless.

It might be cheating, but essentially its all down to you.

I'd like to give some great pointers that I am sure you know

1) Physique - Vital. Absolutely vital. People look at me differently now I work. I now have muscles. I stand up straight

2) Read - Beyond important. The things I've learnt Red Pill

3) Get a look - I'm going to say that I've completely changed my look. I was trendy-ish then wore loud t-shirts with spiderman on them to appear cool

4) Watch Two and a Half Men - Watch Sheen and how he acts

5) Start a business - Times are hard, and make some money. Better then searching ages for a job that might not last a year due to the economic crisis.

6) Get a ride - Don't have a car? Get one. Don't have a good car? Save up and upgrade. I hate to say since I bought my new car, ridiculous. But hey, im not complaining, would you be?

7) Remove yourself from social media - Its more harm then good

8) Read Bang and Day Bang by Roosh - Forget Mystery Method

9) Eliminate Sorry from your vocabulary - It may be hard to do

10) Lastly, learn the way you did. It is a waste of time preaching it, and even worse mentioning it to women.

I hope this helps, you think you've nailed it but you haven't. It takes practice and time. ",Red Pill Theory,False,,t5_2ve1u,False,,

1367944764.0,1dvc8m,Beta Disambiguation,RedPilkington,40,8,66,"Fairly regularly I read the label 'Beta' used to denote negative traits or behaviors in guys. Some times it is used in reference to things that are specifically beta: asking a girl where she would like to eat on a date; while other times is used simply to say 'not alpha'. While these are reasonable uses and largely correct

Considering how much effort is spent in understanding alpha, beta's did pretty well. Women wanted them because they were providers and stayed with them because of marriage. Obviously that has all changed now that women are free to wander off the moment they get the scent of the alpha cock, but it's important to remember. 

Beta is not simply all things un-alpha. In a recent conversation stemming from [this](http://i.imgur.com/AEeUohV.jpg) photo, pegging doesn't really fit in anywhere. It's its simply 'un-masculine'.

I propose a new way of using the terms alpha and beta. An alpha is a male who derives more value from sexual interaction than he puts in

That is a sexual strategy that works remarkably well under the right conditions. In a resource scarce environment a beta would be a woman's best bet for successful reproduction. In that scenario and alpha

Of course today the beta is playing a losing game. The beta sexual strategy is no longer effective. What we have is an environment of plenty, alpha game works. But let us not forget the value of the beta and all he once was.

1362087008.0,19f4zt,Why Can’t I Use a Smiley Face? - Review of Roosh's upcoming book.,redpillschool,37,7,11,"There is a bittersweet calming feeling reading somebody else’s life experiences and identifying them as if there were your own.  On one side of the coin

I was recently given an advance copy of Roosh’s latest work

With all his latest books detailing his various adventures throughout the world

It’s a short book, while I read it, I felt like somebody else knew my experiences. I felt like I was reading a book written *by me!* 

I’ve had a hard time identifying with certain parts of the game community. Although my game is tight- it really is- and despite past success (quite a bit of it), and surely a lot in ten years.

There must be a regional issue, being friendly and outgoing. Around where I am, I find myself going nuclear on women more than being friendly. And it sometimes works, though recently I feel it’s rarely worth it.

Through the book, meeting up with a few friends and sarging the bars. The most amazing (and depressing) thing I kept seeing over and over is how Roosh’s mind worked like my own. In the book, he’s able to detail his thinking process, which is a form of validation to me. 

Perhaps this book is a form of catharsis. For those who have seen the decline in American women, “It’s not you, it’s them.” Sometimes that affirmation is enough of a kick in the nuts to make a plan, start saving, and decide it’s time to leave the country.

We discuss on TheRedPill exactly what mechanisms are causing the degradation of American women. It still surprises me when women have such terrible attitudes. It makes me wonder

&gt;I walked downstairs and approached a mediocre girl. She told me she was a model but even in the dim light I wasn’t seeing it. When I tried to get things moving, “I’m hard, you have to work for me.” No thanks. I left and went upstairs.

*“I’m hard, Facebook, OkCupid, and then bars- there is an entire network made to inflate women’s self-worth, making the streamline of attention from everybody towards women as efficient as possible. And with almost no negative feedback, why would a woman keep her feet on the ground?

My only solace is that long term happiness is not something promised by their lifestyles. 

Throughout the entire book, the bitches, the drunks, etc. The most interesting part about reading this book- the biggest connection I’ve had with a book, mind you- was that each interaction described not only experiences I’ve had, but demonstrated his responses being similar to mine. I’m sure it’s said over and over that bitches aren’t worth your time- but when you’re faced with a population of only bitches, what do you do?

Well Roosh describes in detail exactly what he did. I won’t give away too many spoilers, a new life plan.

Book is slated for release in the second half of March

1. You are physically fit. You don't need to be Don Draper

2. You are moderately accomplished. You won't get anywhere without a paycheque you can be proud of

3. You have pretty sharp game. You are going to need to have some grace and tact. This comes from gaming people.

Those three things are things everyone here *should* be trying to acheive already

*********************************

One of the 10 basic principles of economics is that *People respond to incentives*. This serves as the basis for most of these lessons. If a company want to inrease sales by ten % in a quarter, just because it was like getting 50% off? I know you have. And most people have. The company dangles a carrot in front of your face and you get your things and they get their money. What I'm going to show you is how to do this to your woman. You want her to act more feminem, and what does she want? A strong man thing to tell her what to do, and praise her once in a while. Your praise has to be scarce. Reserve it *only* for when she's done something good. 

**Lesson 1 - Sex**

You have to dominate your women in bed. This means being selfish. This means doing whatever you want to her. Unapologetically have your way with her. Finger her and make her suck your fingers off. Then tell her how hot that was and how well she gets you off. Blow your load on her face

It is important to take it whenever you want. When a woman tells me she's tired, you need to *know* you're in charge. Its okay to tell her you're in charge too. ""I'm in charge, you do what I say, do you understand? Say *yes*"" She'll say yes.

If she actually resists and its not fake resistance (ie- dom sub or roleplaying resistance) than obviously stop. 

Doing this sets the tone for the rest of your relationship and makes everything else come naturally.

**Lesson 2 Dishes and cooking**

If you're buying food

You can get her to do the dishes and clean by a) ordering it and then b) following up with delicious praise. 

Example: ""Why are there so many dirty dishes? Why aren't you doing the dishes? If I buy all the food, then maybe you'll just need to go to your own apartment. This doesn't work for me"". Its really important that you are firm with this. You demonstrate a lot of value by being able to legitamately say this. Your game should be tight enough that you don't care about her loss if she does leave, which she might.

When she caves and is cooking for you and doing dishes, remember. So praise her for cleaning. 

**You're a good woman, follow up with 'I'm serious. I love it when you clean for me. I'm really glad I have you' DEAD PAN SERIOUS FACE. Fuck her like Lesson 1 after this if you really wanna drive it home.

Get her used to hearing ""You're a good woman"" and if she says something snippy back say ""I take it back, tell her she's a bad woman, or a failure as a a woman. 

This all depends on you being successful as a man. Learn as much as you can about positive masculinity to effectively do this.

**Lesson 3 - Positive Masculinity**

Be a man, but you're a man so you can do it. Earn MORE MONEY and STOP SPENDING frivolously. MOVE MOUNTAINS TO MAKE THE WORLD AROUND YOU INTO SOMETHING YOU FIND DESIRABLE.

Learn to build things. Learn abotu tools, even if you don't need them RIGHT NOW. Get skilled. Learn to program. Stop being a lazy pussy boy slob. Go game, swallow your pride. Do squats and deadlifts. Its hard. Most people don't like doing them. But you're a MAN NOW. Learn how to FIGHT. Especially if you don't want to fight. How can you boss around a woman when you're a woman yourself?

I love shaving with a straight razor. My girlfriend was telling people at her work a story and it involved me shaving with my razor on a Sunday night. 

One of the chode managers with a failing marriage says ""pff what kind of person shaves on a Sunday night"" she says ""A *MAN* with a *straight razor*!!"" She brags about my manliness to other men who would try to DLV me when I'm not even there. If you're a man who embraces positive masculinity, she will resent you and defer her affections for a man like me.

Anyway I'd like to find love or at least a commitment before having sex (I have no intention of waiting for marriage... I don't even know if I want marriage)

Took the redpill 1 month ago.  Regretted it at first (just being honest-hard pill to swallow)

I am seriously considering leaving my wife of almost 6 years.  I am 38.  We have no kids (she can't seem to have any).  I am NOT considering divorce because of that.

I married her because back 7 years ago, forced to move back in my parents house in my late 20s.  She was the only girl who gave me any attention. I was needy. But she and I never clicked in terms of chemistry, and I never really had any attraction for her.  I just thought ""I should put that aside, and over time I will grow more attracted to her"".  Nope.  I remember telling a close guy friend that I don't seem to have anything in common with her. He raised the red flag, but I ignored it.  I assumed that over time ""We would grow closer"".  The opposite happened.

I don't know what is up with her, and was very scared of sex.  The first time I was about to go in, her face of fear, you would have thought I was trying to put my fist up her butt.  

Since day 1 of marriage , or seeing other guys.  Past relationships of mine, the sex was anywhere from ok to incredible, so I know that I know at least something about good sex. I've tried so many things to try to ""wake her up"".  Nothing.  Good lord, it took her a year to warm up to the idea of different positions.

Since getting married, she fights.  Nag is her middle name.  She tells her friends that I am trying to ""control her"", like some dude you would see on Oprah that literally controls a wife (tells her what to wear, eat, when she can go out, etc.).  I am not like that at all.  I just stand my ground and not put up with her shit.  (Me standing up for myself is a more recent development)

She does almost nothing around the house except watch TV, and read books.  The only thing she does for the household is the laundry (I ruined a shirt of hers to convince her to not let me to do it).  I do EVERYTHING else, cook, food shopping, finances, clean, yard stuff, and to be fair she also works full time

I read some threads on redpillwomen, and wouldn't be upset if I left her. Sister told me when we were both out getting drunk with friends.

The flip side is that I feel guilty

Thoughts? Am I being selfish and too entitled?  Or am I justified in my consideration of calling it all off?  Hoping to get some RedPillWomen input too.

**UPDATE:**  Thanks for the brutal truth.  I wanted to hear from you guys, doing something I really enjoy.  I've even found a niche in the field that I am growing in, a niche that I MIGHT consider starting my own business with.  Been in it 5 years now and I am even growing into an informal leader here in my team.  And at home, I am the main income earner by a margin of 2:1.

- Partying is defined as going to someone's house, drinking, being chatty, and most importantly dancing to typically pop-like, romantic, sexual music. It is feminine music, it is music more liked by women than men. Masculine music from country to metal to dubstep noise is generally not partying in this sense. Party music always has sexy tunes and lyrics that are all about romance, relationship, but in the nineties it was Ricky Martin, because if women start dancing men will start dancing too

- Partying is a highly sexualized environment. The music is all about romance. Women try to look their best. Men show off their best moves on the dancefloor, pairing off or at least getting some confidence improving flirts and validation.

- You can add to this idea the traditional disco environment with the colorful lights, the idea is to make women relaxed and happy so that they open up sexually.

- Generally the only thing men like about this all is women. I.e. that this environment, this whole thing is meant to make women happy, relaxed and sexually open. All it delivers to men is the women. (This is why the often unequal entry policies i.e. women often get in for free, men pay an entry fee.) This is not something that is meant for men, neither the decor nor the music, men are not meant to enjoy it much, the idea is just enjoying the women there. If there would be some kind of a male-only event meant to make men happy it would sure as hell not have mirror balls and red and yellow lights and music like [Samba di Janeiro](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bx1iclqbNyM). It would more likely to have a cowboy-saloon decor of wood and leather and some kind of country-rock music.

- In other words, open up sexually, and for men it is a mildly boring/annoying thing to endure because it delivers sexually opened up women.

- So if you can satisfy your sexual and relationship needs elsewhere, if you can find your GF or soft harem or adventures elsewhere, then you are really not losing out if you avoid it. You can feel free to go to places that don't have such a sexual athmosphere and plays music you actually like. (If all you know is partying pop music, try the following 7 genres: country, metal esp. Turisas type fighting metal, hard techno, dubstep
jazz

- Even if you think you could use this ""crutch"" because you are not (yet) full alpha, in a more chatty place like a party in someone's house or a bar they may downright cut in and aggressively invite a girl you are talking with to a drink. I have always felt downright 
suppressed, because I did not know how to react, my only idea was a punch and I did not have the nuts to do that. Partying is a **crazy competitive** environment and a guy who is decently confident in normal circumstances can very quickly be betaized into a total wimp at a party. So unless you are the top of the top, you better find your GF somewhere else.

Parallel to make it clearer: suppose you own a construction company and John, and everybody but the most aggressive loses. This is partying - a form of entertainment that is extremely focused on being a competitive sexual 
marketplace. Now making a pickup or finding a GF in some other place from jazz club to library is more like you approach John at a golf club, the whole thing is just more relaxed.

Of course if you enjoy partying and works for you then do it. But if you have this dread in your gut that oh no Saturday is coming, you can meet women elsewhere, there are other forms of entertainment, other and much likely more enjoyable musical events to spend the Saturday night (see above 7 genres), it's not something everybody but stay at home losers MUST do. (And even people who stay at home are not necessarily losers, some just decide to.) Modern culture tries to cajole men into thinking that partying is necessary and a MUST or else you are the hopeless, ridiculous guy with no social life and no chance at women. It is NOT true. It is luring you into a trap. There are other options.",False,theory,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1h124t/partying_what_it_is_really_is_what_it_is_really/

1371594077.0,1gm5um,What I've Learned from Roller Derby,culofiesta,35,9,23,"I had some requests to talk more about the time I spent dating a derby girl and what I've learned from women because of it. I could write a book on this but I'll try to be more succinct. Most of the women I met in derby are awesome people I consider friends to this day. This is not a slam on derby women or the sport (which is actually pretty impressive)

- Roller derby tends to attract a lot of women that see themselves as ""alphas"". What ends up happening is they all talk over each other. I was the only male present at a ""girl's night out"" where my then gf hosted a dinner in our apartment. They were all talking over each other

- They also try to outdo each other when it comes to drinking. As a result many women in derby are serious alcoholics. 

- Also with sex. They try to outdo each other with sex stories. There is a lot of girl on girl and every fantasy imaginable. There is a clique of lesbians that have slept with a good percentage of the entire league.

- At their parties there would be at least one pair of breasts flashed

- The shit talking is unfathomable. At any time there are a dozen dramas with a number of women not talking to each other. Out of nowhere they will be friends again

- Just as in any sport there are some worthless players and some great ones but the cream rises to the top and most of the worthless ones don't even last a season. A number of women join just to call themselves derby girls and drop out after playing a game or two. I know one woman that barely played one season and still writes a blog about being a derby girl though she hasn't played for years. 

- Cheating is rampant. One team is full of cheaters and one girl is notorious for it. She's so good at cheating she is on the national team and is rated as one of the best players in the country. She's very good but she got most of her points from crying at the ref and stamping her feet.

Mistress:

A few months ago, but it did set our wheels turning down in LO.  We have been expecting this for a while.

Fortunately

The word

Now, to bring the Knights to heel.

However, even the most deluded of Knights could temporarily defect in cases where the inconvenient meaning was absent from actual circumstances.  ""Online rape,"" for instance, has still failed to gain traction (although this department still counts ""raping [me/her] with his eyes"" as a solid victory).  Further, we were backstabbed by the unfortunate...fantasies...that some of our number have been having.  Worse, some of the Knights noticed this and joined the ranks of the hated misogynists!

What we needed was a way to *maximize* a threat to get the Knights to fight

The word ""rapey"" solves all these problems.  Observe:

--- What does it mean?  Nothing!  It means that something or someone ""feels like rape.""  Of course

--- Its root is taken from 1.0

--- (This, ""-ey,"" is diminuitive, belittling---similar to a nickname we might use with a child.  No one would call an *actual rapist* ""rapey;"" they'd call them a rapist!  As such, whatever dangerous sick edge our hated enemies might acquire as a side effect of our labeling, has been successfully blunted.

**Prep**

I got a phone call on Friday. Its a bar tender I know who is a successful pua in town. He invites me to a gala. I look up the gala and without hesitation I agree to go. Tons of babes in dresses

**Pre drink**

I go to his place for the predrink. I meet some affluent gentlemen who are going to the gala too. We have a few mixed drinks, worth it everytime. Why? Because pussy is easier to get when you look rich. I'm wearing a $400+ dollar watch my dad gave me for my highschool graduation 8 years ago. Its broken, but no one's gonna know that. Its shiny and big, looks so alpha. I'm wearing 40 dollar calvin klein boxer briefs, and 16 dollar socks. Your undergaments say a lot about you to any bitch you're gonna nail. The devil is in the details.

**At the gala**

We enter together, they like me, the environment is warm. The betas move in, and in beta fashion, all surround the hottest girl of the bunch and orbit her. Now, if they were schooled properly, they would have left her to me and gone after the other lesser girls. But they didn't. I don't have time for this shit, having spotted a pretty brunette standing by herself by a table.

**First set**

I walk over in front of her and say ""So I got this phone call last night..."" She looks at me, having a great time and her friend shows up. Blonde, kinda chubby, but cute.

**Enter blonde friend**

""I guess this is who you were waiting for"" I say. I start to kino and chat the blonde. I'm showing both of them a great time. I run through some bullshit material like the Ring routine (works everytime) and my standard line ""I bet there is some hilarious story about how you two met right?"" and ""We should start a band together, and you get the cowbell"" blah blah blah. Later that night the girls laugh at me because I was only 25 and they thought I was 38. It ruins my chances with them because they're in their 30's and they have kids and shit. I felt a little weird, they started calling me a baby and stuff. Weird. We had a great time but I could see it wasn't going anywhere. I grab the blonde's number and leave.

**Second set**

I go to my bar tender friend and he's got a few girls with him. He introduces them to me. There was a hot hot blonde there who everyone afterward said looked like [7 of 9](http://imgur.com/gallery/VmtcPiT). She shakes my hand, but she goes ""you looked like you were having such a great time with them... I couldn't interupt. You must have great game""

*Red pill comment: Preselection rears its ugly head. This girl was madly into me because other women were madly into me. Also

**First cock block attempt**

She's got her hands on me, takes and awful picture of me, and tells me that ""I'll show it to her in the morning and if she still likes you she'll call!! Lets go Natalie!!"" I quickly put my arm around the brunette's waist. ""Natalie, you have such great friends... look at how much she cares about you! You're a lucky woman to have friends like this."" I look brunette in the eye, give a sly grin ""I like you, I want you to me *my* friend... Are you having a good night tonight??"" Brunette blushes and goes ""Oooh, look at him try to win me overrrrrr"" Bitchface brunette approves of my after that. All good

**Cock block attempt #2**

Big muscular meat head guy in a not so stylish suit comes up. He's clearly bigger than me by a lot. He grabs her arm and asks to talk to her. I look at her talking to him for about 2 seconds and decide I'm not even gonna try to compete. Feed her ego? No. I got my number close

A friend of mine tells me that the big muscle guy after was saying ""What the FUCK! I work out SIX TIMES A WEEK! Why would she leave with HIM?!"" - Game. And the guy was being beta. She said he was asking if he could come over to sleep on her couch. She said she wanted to run in the morning, tryhard, and he wouldn't let up.

**F close**

I'm back at her place, she remarks about my nice underwear. I take off her clothes and since I don't have a condom I'm thinking to myself ""Zion... if you get herpes from this bitch... its totally worth it. She's so hot"". I bang the shit out of her, raw dog. I flip her around and I'm wailing on her doggy style and she lets out the cry of a true slut ""CUM ON ME NOT IN ME!!"" I gladly oblige her. We bang two or three times. She passes out. Farts on my leg all night. Like the most disgusting farts you ever smelled. Disgusting. She made me a great omelette in the morning. She's about to go run with her dad and she says ""I don't know if I can run... you split me open last night"", she tells me him and her never got along til recently. That explains a lot. Daddy issues. She drives me home. 

I bang her a dozen times over the next week and stop talking to her because she develops an attitude and I got what I wanted already.

**Final thoughts**

You can pick up the hottest bitches with Pre-selection. I did not get herpes, but I game erryday. All of the betas that night and the few alphas present gave me mad props and respect for my conquest. It was merely one of many though. It was how I started my reputation as a rake.

Hope you enjoyed reading.

I read an analogy that sums up my feelings on most of these occurences tonight that I thought was worth discussion.

""Let me explain by means of an analogy with something less emotionally laden. Consider someone who purchases a lottery ticket which does not 
win the prize. Suppose he were to argue as follows: “I put my money down 
because I wanted the prize. I wouldn’t have paid if I had known I was going 
to lose; therefore I have been deprived of my money against my will; therefore 
I am the victim of theft.” No one would accept this argument as valid. Why 
shouldn’t we?


For the very good reason that it denies the fundamental principle behind 
all personal responsibility. Those who want to make their own choices in life 
must be willing to accept the consequences of those choices. Consider the alternative: If every loser in a lottery were entitled to a refund there would be no 
money left for the prize
institutions depend upon people taking responsibility for their actions
agreements and fulﬁ lling obligations regardless of whether or not they happen 
to like the consequences.""

Jerry had been given everything from the get go. A coddled only child, Jerry is also very physically attractive with great game.

He is also very dependent on constant validation, which is why his severe need for validation confused me). He was my older brother's college roomie for six years and even my bro has told me that he's always been a validation hound from the beginning. 

I found very bizarre that this sexual conquistador was even seeking validation from me (freshly post-blue pill and pretty inexperienced with successful scenarios, Jerry still unknowingly slips in the blue pill puddle from time to time because of his need for validation and his inability to cope with disappointments in general.

Relationship problems are generally caused by broken rules and over-familiarity.  

By ""rules"" I refer to unspoken beliefs that usually involve the word ""should"" or ""must"".  
""She should have called me back."" ""She shouldn't have acted like that."" ""She has to see that I'm right about this."" And so on.  

Over-familiarity occurs when two people spend too much time together and share the same space for too long. Subconsciously

&gt; The other advice you will get here on answers is to gather more power to yourself. Ironically this is also the opposite of what you should do. The problem facing modern wives is that they live in a de facto matriarchy. This means that your mother in law not only outranks you, she disregards him when he is acting merely as your agent. The solution is to make your husband the head of the household. Husbands are naturally protective of their wives, and if he understands he is leading he will feel a strengthened sense of responsibility to protect you. If he pushes back on her from the legitimate position of head of his own household, you will be astonished at how quickly she will settle down. Part of what this kind of mother in law is craving is firmness from the men in her family. I know of some cases where the mother in law changed so completely that she now takes the daughter in law out to lunch and they are like best friends.

Taken from [the social pathologist's blog](http://socialpathology.blogspot.com/2010/09/sexual-partner-divorce-risk.html):
&gt; Cohabitation

&gt;Jay Teachman, which is available online, makes for interesting reading. Teachman's genius was to look stratify the cohabitors risk of divorce by the by the number of sexual partners/cohabiting history.

&gt;The study was based on data from the National Survey of Family Growth 1995 cycle and involved over 6500 women.

&gt;It was controlled for a host of variables.

&gt;The study was in no way sponsored or funded by any conservative organisation.

&gt;&gt;Teachman's conclusion: 
&gt;&gt;The results presented in this article replicate findings from previous research: Women who cohabit prior to marriage or who have premarital sex have an increased likelihood of marital disruption. Considering the joint effects of premarital cohabitation and premarital sex
&gt;Executive summary: It's not the liberal values

&gt;And

&gt;&gt;This limitation notwithstanding, the relevant distinction to make is between people who form multiple relationships and people who form a single, longer lasting relationship.**

***TL; DR:*** He also [super imposes Teachman's findings onto the heritage study](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_R-WhB9g9eYk/TJDSr8V_ShI/AAAAAAAAAOg/VmMGTymAVcI/s1600/teachman).


**Promiscuous women have an elevated risk of depression**

There was a study done on college students a while ago, Vol. 43, No. 3, August 2006, pp. 255-267](http://life.umt.edu/curry/DOcs-SOS/Current%20Peer%20Educators/Articles/Grello_et_al.pdf).  

On page 263

Further up
&gt; The CES-D was developed as a self-report instrument to measure depressive symptoms in the general population. **Higher values signify more symptoms of depression.** A score of 0-14 has been found to be equivalent to the levels of depressive symptoms in the general population; a score of 15-36 has been found to indicate the individual is ""at risk"" for depression; and a score of 37 or higher has been found equivalent to scores found in clinically depressed individuals.

**TL; DR:** Men's depressive symptoms were roughly unaffected by their number of sexual partners; in contrast

All important human preferences are biologically hardwired to ensure maximum reproductive capability. 

Humans naturally find corpses unattractive. Why? Because the same bacteria that digest dead human flesh can  infect a living person.

Humans find certain landscapes inherently [beautiful.](http://miriadna.com/desctopwalls/images/max/Landscape-with-calm-river.jpg) Why? Because a bright green field with an adjacent river is lush and fertile and will support many huntable animals or an abundance of  crops. Humans are drawn to pristine landscapes because they make an ideal place to make a home.

Humans are hardwired to fear certain things. Heights

Mate selection is by far the most important decision am organism makes in its lifetime. You can bet your redpill ass that, full lips and wide hips. These woman have the easiest pregnancy, and children with lowest incidents of birth defects or miscarriage. Older and obese women are not attractive regardless of feminist propaganda, because they have more difficulty caring a child to term without defects.

Woman can hamster all they want. They can write persuasive tumbler articles. Teach sexuality classes in university where beauty is relative

Dont take no for an answer if I stop trying then it will be awkward because I have a year and a half left in the same class with her. Keep asking her out on dates. She keeps going with me.

Come over to 'study for class' in her apartment, 3 Dollar Cupcake. Her roommate sees this. Made her look good in front of roommate. Has some shit to put on Facebook to brag to her friends about feels wanted. Received a shit ton of affirmation. 

Month later ask her out, dislike the dating/party scene and alcohol need stability for bodybuilding and school. Doesnt want to have sex because of jesus, fuck her in the butt, tired of butt fucking take virginity. Three years go by. Chill low maintenance relationship. No arguments, No yelling, she buys me food sometimes, Spend Christmases with her family so I don't have to be lonely jew on Christmas. Enjoy faling asleep on nice warm boobies every night.

Last April her Slut friends invite her to Vegas with them. She spends spring break there getting hit on by all sorts of dudes. Inundated with male attention and validation. Comes back feels bored by our relationship. Breaks up two weeks later because she needs to discover herself. Tell her that her self discovery is not about herself but throttling dicks. She denies this gets angry. Tells me we should stay friends because im the only other friend she has in University

Sleeping by myself feels terrible. Cry at night. Start fucking again in an open relationship

It made me think about the stigma associated with infidelity, and who monogamy benefits. Then i realized that women, the masters of doublethink, practice hypergamy and (in the same breath) say that **cheating is wrong.**

1.) The Stigma Of Cheating

Our culture (for the sake of this thread, for people who break the social contract of a committed relationship. Society has created a culture of shame associated with people who not only break the contract, but the people who aid in it or do not prevent it from happening. The question is *why?*

I would **guess** it is because 51% of the american populace is female

2.) What the women gain

 By promoting monogamy

 This dynamic also serves to keep men from pursuing other women while in the ""committed relationship"" for fear of social reprisal. Women will appeal to a man's sense of honor to keep him loyal. Worse

3.) What beta's gain

 By promoting monogamy

4.) The thing that really counts

My boyfriend has, if you will) relationship to women.  

I think it started with his mother.  His mother is overbearing and forces everyone around her to bend to her will.  She is on her fourth marriage; my boyfriend is her second of two children.  His mother is not nurturing at all.  She would complain about their fathers to their faces when they were young.  She was never loving or affectionate.  She worked night shift, my boyfriend usually tries to avoid her.  When they are in contact, he feels as if he is always walking on eggshells.  He does not have a good relationship with his father--they haven't spoken in years.

His brother (from a different father) is an alpha in many ways.  He is older and works a high powered job.  He is the dominant partner in his relationship with his wife and with others.  He spends a good deal of time on his appearance.  As far as I know, but maintains a certain amount of, let's call it pity, for him, mostly related to his job and social status requiring a certain amount of slavery -- slavery to his work, social expectations, trends

My boyfriend has dated a handful of women before me.  There are a number of qualities that the majority of them share.  They are high-maintenance, who was so emotionally distant and whom he saw so infrequently they might as well have been an online relationship.)

I love him.  I do not want to break up with him.  But

Some examples:

1.  He thinks that I, partially out of selfish desire because I strongly value my alone time.  He thinks that I will feel jealous and lonely, no matter how many times I state otherwise.  

2.  His beta personality doesn't just affect his relationship with women

3.  He is physically intimidated by other men.  His past girlfriends told him about their ""dream guys""; just one example included firemen.  My boyfriend is tall and thin

I love him and care very much for him.  I like to think that we have a good relationship going, which I think makes him feel good.  After good sex (our most recent, for example), he says that he felt more like a man than usual.  

But what if we break up

In a half-burned house

None had ever such faith | as to trust in them all.

Nor trust too soon in thy son;

Men false to women are found;
When fairest we speak
Against wisdom we work with deceit.

And the beauty praise | of the maiden bright;
He wins whose wooing is best.

Ever with any other;
Oft the wise are fettered
By beauty that breeds desire.

94. Fault with another | let no man find
For what touches many a man;
Wise men oft | into witless fools
Are made by mighty love.

95. The head alone knows | what dwells near the heart
A man knows his mind alone;
No sickness is worse | to one who is wise
Than to lack the longed-for joy.

And long my love awaited;
As my life the maiden | wise I loved
Yet her I never had.

In slumber bright as the sun;
Empty appeared | an earl's estate
Without that form so fair.

The warriors all were awake;

I've created account today for the community's advice. I'm a 33 male with a 33 old wife. Married 9 years

This past weekend I caught my wife making out with another woman. The woman is a ""consultant"" who came to our home the weekend after spending a few days with my wife at work. She's from across the country and while I know they've communicated before her arrival I'm fairly confident they have never met before the incident.

Anyway, leaving my wife alone with this ""consultant.""

For some reason I had a bad feeling in my stomach so even though it made me feel ridiculous I camped out at a window overlooking the firepit and watched my wife with this other woman (the consultant). My wife eventually began touching her neck, but could only make out parts of the conversation. At one point I hear my wife say to her ""I promise I won't hurt you.""  After about 20 minutes of sitting incredibly close, and touching in very friendly ways,  I see them kiss.

A few minutes after they kiss

I pull her off the woman and demand to know what is going on. They are both clearly VERY intoxicated. They lie and say they were just cuddling. I asked if anything physical happened and of course they say no. They only admit to kissing after I told them what I saw. Of course I'm angry and yelling. Meanwhile this other woman is telling me to sit down and calm down on my own property. I tell her to leave and since she's too drunk to drive that I'll take her back to the hotel. They both tell me that she is not comfortable with me at the moment and won’t ride with me. I tell my wife I need to talk with her about the incident right then and that she should ask the woman to leave. She doesn't.

After that I packed my kids up and took them to my fathers (at 3 am). It took 40 minutes for my wife to realize what happened but what followed was a series of phones between my wife and I were she was yelling at me and calling me ridiculous for taking the kids. 

Eventually I came home later that morning (around 7) and had a 6 hour conversation with my wife.  She said she was just drunk and eventually admitted to kissing the woman several times. She insisted that nothing else happened. I was skeptical and asked several challenging/cyncial questions. 

She basically she said was curious (even though this isn't the first time she's kissed another woman). I told her my problem wasn't that she kissed another woman

She eventually provided answers that satisfied about 98% of my curiosity, doing more with the children and around the house. It SEEMS like she's genuinely sorry. 

Things were great for those few days

I was pissed, and the only significant interaction with her.

I later checked the phone records and found out the call was 20 minutes not 2. She said that they really didn't talk that much

In short, she’s been incredibly apologetic, has fucked me more in the last 5 days than in the last 5 weeks, and is basically giving me whatever I want.

I’ve been following the mate guarding advice

Should bisexual/lesbian infidelity be treated differently than classic infidelity?

How does a bisexual encounter factor into hypergamy? 

I’m pissed about the lying (of course) but I can’t figure out if this is a case of her wanting to explore with another woman

1369002751.0,1ennyw,A realisation I'd like to share,somedickcream,46,17,21,"This post is a result of seeing the video in [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1emrfa/in_this_video_girls_who_dont_like_their_boyfriend/). I started a new thread because I want to tie other aspects in the discussion

So the premise is, while themselves have platonic (from their standpoint) relationships with other men. 

On the surface it may seem like hypocrisy or obliviousness on their part. But hear me out

The way I see it, and (most of them) can get sex whenever. They use this asset to gain what they value tenfold, emotional intimacy, to gain another link in the support chain of companionship and validation (the other links being friends and family).

So you have two major needs: sex and emotional intimacy. Each one being more important than the other to both sexes. Men value sex &gt; emotional intimacy

Let's apply this to the premise. A woman (like one from the video), even if they want sex from her, all she wants from them is someone to talk to/go to movies/chat/spend time/etc. She thinks it's ok because sex is off the table with these men - so the boyfriend has nothing to worry about, nothing to be jealous about. 

At the same time

1. The other girls are maybe using her boyfriend for emotional intimacy -  taking one of her links (with it - attention/love/validation/companionship) away from her. I can't be the only one noticing how terriotial some women are.

2. The boyfriend is sexually attracted to them.

3. Both 1 and 2

So from her standpoint, so her boyfriend shouldn't be against it. And thanks to feminism, guys are perceived as slaves to their own libido, so any assumption on her part about her boyfriend and other women are automatically validated by society. Moreover, any other woman around her man interferes with the network, takes some of the attention away. Sexual or not, she won't like it. 

The conclusion here is not just hypocrisy

The outcome is  she can get what she values most without any scrutiny. You can say that she can have her cake and eat it too. 


This also explains why you hear stories where a woman is jealous when one of her platonic male friends gets a girlfriend, therefore losing something she deems valuable.

Because you have a penis, men, we will fallaciously attack a component of your anatomy.

* Slurs get you benned.

Apparently they can't spell ban.

* Being a misogynist, transphobic, homophobic, creepy chucklefuck also gets you benned.

Sounds good. Define misogynist. Anybody who disagrees? 

* You post in MR? Thats great

Because men don't deserve rights. I mean

* Misandry? DONT REAL. NO BAN

Honestly though

* Diet/Weight loss talk is benned.

When you speak to someone (different than when someone is speaking to you, be totally unwavering. Get used to letting your eyes go out of focus a little bit. Yes. That much eye contact. Do this almost any time you are speaking to someone, especially if your portion of the dialogue at that moment consists of any more than one sentence. 

You do not want to stare someone down every time you talk. That is not what I am talking about. There is a fine line between staring and looking away that is solid eye contact, you will appear a thousand times more alpha, and more importantly, a thousand times more charismatic and credible overall. People will start respecting what you have to say. They will naturally want to interrupt you less, even if you aren't looking at or talking to them.

 Don't look at people hard when you speak, focused, but easy. 

When people speak to you, this can make people slightly nervous, not in a creepy way but in an intimidated way; they might even pause to try and remember what they were saying. (This can, however be employed as a killer strategy during any kind of conflict)

 You will, and their eyes do not divert from yours, keep eye contact yourself. This displays equal charisma and credibility. To divert your eyes from a man when he speaks to you can be interpreted as weakness on your own part. 

 My personal rule of thumb when being spoken to (in non-confrontational, and anticipate (use your peripherals) when the person will look back at you. Once they have come back, wait 2-3seconds or wait until you begin to speak in reply, whichever comes first, then make eye contact again. Wait for them to break eye contact 3-4 times during conversation, then break it yourself that 4th or 5th time for just a couple of seconds. This will keep the listener engaged without making them feel uncomfortable. The nonverbal aspect of the conversation will remain natural and uninhibited, as led by you. 

If you are in confrontation (conflict, you probably want them to stutter and stammer all over the place; you are right, and they are wrong (hopefully, if you know what you are talking about); you want the frame of the conversation to appear as such. Don't stare them down too terribly hard even still (you don't want to seem like you are ready to slug them unless you actually are),  just take out all breaks in eye contact on your part. They will be at a loss for words, because they will be trying too hard not to say the wrong thing; they know that their opponent is poised and ready to rebut. 

In pickup situations, instead of maintaining eye contact most of the time with short breaks as I previously described, you want to drop eye contact to almost a nil. To do this properly with a woman implies something different than what it implies with men: not weakness, but aloofness. Look at her eyes just long enough to give her the impression that you are somewhat listening to her, and that is it. You want to keep her questioning in her mind whether or not she is actually getting through to you at all. Then, when you reply, keep that same unwavering eye contact as you did before. To look into a woman's eyes incessantly while she speaks to you is to give the impression of desire on your part. Once she knows you want her, but gauge yourself and your partner in your relationship to know when and how and how often to drop your defenses. This strategy of eye contact in pickup is basically a defense mechanism, and don't look in any one place for more than 3-5 seconds. Look at your drink, the coasters on the table

If you ever have to pause in search of words (not a deliberate pause for emphasis, break eye contact immediately, as looking into someone's eyes without having something to say constitutes staring right off the bat (staring is creepy). Don't take it too far by looking away like a nervous schoolboy; you don't want to break frame. You want to remain facing them and divert your eyes (to the side,usually). You can also divert your eyes to the forehead to send a subconscious message of superiority. Avoid the mouth and chin altogether; it is a subconscious faux-pas (what's wrong, is there something in my teeth?). 

Of course these are all rough guidelines, and then as in anything a true man does, you have to fully own that shit. Consciously, deliberately tailor yourself a set of nonverbal practices, starting with eye contact as a foundation and moving through other gestures such as posture, body position, and last (and also least) hand gestures.

The best way to get started with this is to find a frame of reference in an alpha male role model you look up to and blatantly steal qualities you like from them (you still have to make these gestures your own

[Bill Clinton.] (http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7ffbFvKlWqE&amp;desktop_uri=%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7ffbFvKlWqE)  Here is a great example of what you should and should not do in body language. Regardless of what you subscribe to politically (I don't personally agree with everything that Clinton stood for) we all know that Clinton won the hell out of this debate. Everything about his body language, confidence, and earnestness, without coming across as overbearing or too intense. Bush, on the other hand, in this video provides us with an example of all the things in a man's body language that can be interpreted as a sign of weakness. He barely makes eye contact with the guest during the first half of his answer, he keeps his body turned to the side most of the time that he speaks, it is a harsh

However sometimes it does make you think what they say

1. ""You are so immature,"" etc. Thats because I believe the people closest to you envy your carefree outlook, and the fact we aren't pessimistic. Did you know there is also no historical account or thesis that men throughout history were ""mature?"" That probably means even Henry VIII used to say ""yo, pull my finger biatch, or off with your head.""

2. ""Do things for others, pathetic manipulative way to try and make you feel guilty. Don't. Im not saying dont give to charity. But I am saying do not become the charity.

3. ""You are being rude""; Unless youre effing and blinding, and what have they always said ""you are being rude, she thinks you are rude."" Is that why shes laughing? Is that why shes smiling? Is that why she's always coming over. They only think you are being rude because they havent got even one of the balls YOU have to do what you are doing.

4. ""Just go up to her and tell her you think shes beautiful""; No comment

5. ""You got to make more of an effort with e.g. family,""; Let me tell you something, if you aren't making an effort with family etc, theres one reason. You dont like them. You don't share the same interests. They don't stimulate you. Don't misinterpret that. Last time I watched a film with my family, was the Dark Knight Rises. My mum critiqued it, my dad almost fell asleep. I remembered why it had been 3 years since I last sat with those morons to watch anything. Don't feel guilty.

8. ""You like to be single? When you going to settle down?""; Yawn.

9. ""No wonder you don't keep women around long

I was 7, and 5-year-old brother.  Across the street and one house to the right, there lived a family with two girls, also 7 and 5.  They were the only children our age in the neighborhood, so we ended up playing with them quite a bit.  And they had a Nintendo.

I should explain that my mother was very anti-videogame and -television for most of my childhood.  Two hours of Saturday morning cartoons and the occasional family movie night were allowed

Well, and was far more interested in Duck Hunt and Super Mario.  And so one day they exercised their rights as Strong Independent Women In Training to try to lay some domestic ground rules.  This is the scene that played out:

**Brooke**: ""We're not going to let you play Nintendo.  We're going to play house instead.""

**7yo _whistler**: ""Nah

**Brittany**: ""No!  Play house with us!""

**7yo _whistler**: ""That sounds dumb.  Turn on the Nintendo.""

**Brooke**: ""All you ever do is play Nintendo

**7yo _whistler**:  *shrugs* ""Okay.  Later.""

*30 seconds later as I'm walking home

**Brooke**: ""Okay!  Come back!  Okay!  You can play Nintendo!  Come baaaack!""

Many ducks were hunted that day.  And the dog got shot a few times.

I got a text last night from a girl I used to know. She has a bf so hasn't really talked to me in a long time. She asks how I am and what I'm up to. 

*I take this as an IOI. She's clearly thinking of me. Something is probably wrong in paradise with the bf*

*The hook* 

I tell her I miss seeing her and it would really turn me on to see a sexy pic of her.

*Some casual text escalation*

**The real issue**

Her: You'd have to work for it

Me: What does that even mean? ;P

Me: If you're not gonna have fun doing it

Her: I guess I just like teasing because its nice to feel like at least somebody finds me attractive

*boom. Cats outta the bag. BF doesn't make her feeeel attractive. She's unhaaaaaapy. hahaha oh man... this is gonna be cake*

**Sowing the seeds of discord**

I ask her where her boyfriend is. She says 'you tell me! He's not here right now and when he is

Me: Is he with another woman? Maybe you just need to releive your frustrations on someone

*haha I know

Her: Maybe I just need some male attention

Me: You should come over and see me this weekend. You can take some of those frustrations out on me. Send me a pic before bed. Night

She sends me a nude pic almost immediately. Gonna get some extra sexy time this weekend. Score. Almost too easy.

Firstly I'm so glad that a place like this exists

Now I grew up always questioning gender norms since i was in elementary school - starting off with ""never hit a girl"" being shoved down our throats. 
I was pleasantly surprised in 2011, GWW, Stardusk and manwomenmyth to see people pointing out things I've always felt about society but could never articule. 

Now to my questions

1) What is the diplomatic/alpha way to respond when you get cut off mid sentence. this isn't happening in a meeting with big-wigs, she just jumps in quickly asks a question to the person i was talking to, and he gets involved with her existing conversation. It's just frustrating because I have no idea to react. It's happens very quickly, It's annoying as hell, but you can't respond agressivly, because the whole vibe at lunch is laid back and people would just be like ""it's no big deal calm down"". And then she acknowledged it and gave me an over the shoulder ""sorry"" before contining with her conversation.  i think a lot of it is due to tonality, posture and perception - all things i'm working on. But surely there is a way to fucking assert myself without being shamed out of the office or told it's not a big deal


2) Again office related. Myself and 3 women i work with were leaving office and walking to a car, and she was carrying a big box (personal things), somewhat struggling but seemed like she could manage. And obviously one of the other two started with ""are you going to let her carry that!?"" and you see i'm a red pill inductee but how the hell can i deal with people, shaming you into being whatever they define a man is on that particular day. And I work with them, i can't go on a rant and jeopardize the working relationship/friendship especially in a company where literally every other male is a blue pill white knights. And it's just ridiculous, because you know, i know and they certainly know that had it been just the three of them they would've managed just fine. It's just pure laziness.


**TL;DR:**
Red pill taker
1)how do you deal with alphafemale (or alpha anyone) cutting you off mid sentence?
2)how to deal with being casually shamed into chivalry?

Whenever a discussion occurs about why men prefer female virgins

Well

- Girls think guys who are still virgins are not desired by anyone.

- Guys think girls who are still virgins are pure and desirable.

I am proud and quite excited to report that I ""swallowed the pill"" and my god

As a 23 year old college senior on the verge of graduation

I had a modicum of familiarity with TRP philosophy, thinking in terms of accomplishing goals) which led to the meeting of the first girl I would truly ""love"".  Unfortunately, over the next 2 1/2 years I would slowly -- but surely -- acquiesce to the Blue Pill mentality and eventually become a walking proponent of feminism.  

Despite a visceral disconnect with my own masculinity, and still fucked like jack rabbits.  I was working through school and working -- she a stable job too -- and we had created a ""successful"" and ""loving"" relationship.  However, I couldn't reconcile the feelings of want with the Blue Pill oasis I had created.  I reached a a breaking point and abruptly ended things with my first ""love""/co-ed roommate/emotional confidant/ ""best friend"".  I immediately felt a sense of empowerment and freedom, however they were ephemeral and fleeting.  My empowerment was overwhelmed with a resounding regret and my celebrated, brassy freedom melted into an anvil that anchored me to the bottom of a pit of despair; I sewed a seed of Oneitis for this girl who -- although a good person -- was incapable fulfilling my needs, and that seed sprouted a weed that choked off my budding masculinity which was trying to grow and liberate me from the shackles of Beta.

I hate to admit it, and all the while she had begun exploiting her SMV and had immediately began sleeping with our crossfit coach.  Like a true beta, I told her i was okay with it -- she needed to see other people and have a broader horizon of experience (read: hop on the cock carousel).  I had allowed myself to be victimized by hypergamy, and I was desperately trying to lay the blame on anything and everything except for myself.  I tried ""reaching out"" to my former coach who was 10 years my senior to ""work out a solution"", and eventually accepted the role as an orbiter who was waiting in the margins to shower my ex in affection whenever she had a moment away from slurping her own pussy juice off his cock.   

For the next 3 months

And then I was fucked up with a TRP knowledge bomb.  After a co-worker told me to look up *PIMP* by Iceberg Slim on the internet, and asking myself if the Beta, Blue-Pill-Swallowing, Orbiter role I had assumed could ever get me to where I wanted to be as a man.  The answer was painfully simple: the only way I was ever going to get back to glazing faces on a daily basis was going to be through (metaphorically) murdering the bitch-made feminist pussy I had become.  It is with great pleasure that I report that a new thrivingivory has emerged from that dark Oneitis underbelly.   

Change -- starting with my thoughts -- was a necessarily fundamental force for initiating the transformation to Alpha; I realized that the only sonnuvabitch who could actually help me was myself.  So, and found a prime studio apartment in a socially robust neighborhood; I quit watching Netflix &amp; pornhub and started reading; I deleted my facebook; and most importantly, I **CHOSE** to quit defining myself by the unreciprocated feelings of an ex girlfriend, and started to assert myself as the reincarnation of Adonis.  

It's been 2 weeks since the entirety of these changes and modifications to my livelihood have been actualized.  My confidence is so high and my self-assuredness so sound, and I haven't found a girl -- or guy for that matter -- who doesn't stare in awe at a sculpted physique with 8 pack abs.  TRP has effected a plethora of positive changes in my life, and I am a man going my own damn way. 

tl;dr: I was a hardcore Beta-bitch after a breakup and I underwent a paradigm shift sparked by ""swallowing the pill"" that has sent me down the path of an Alpha

My gf told me in december that she wants to explore.  we talked about it and she wanted me to ""stick around"" while she explores and comes backs to me at a later date.  I said fuck that and I gave her the ultimatum of coming to a decision in a week or 2 but she stayed. However, every now and then, the thought of exploring and seeing what is out there is on her mind and now its really making her go crazy.  she tells me she loves me but her feelings on exploring is stronger than ever. 

now she has had 2 boyfriends before but they were never as serious as we have been, I think that she fears spending the rest of her life with just one person and wants to see what is out there.  she tells me that i've been great and really supportive and hates that she is doing this to me, but, essentially, i think the hamster is going off and she is rationalizing that going out to explore, will satiate her fears.  

she is one of the most genuine girls you would ever meet, I feel as if its something on my end.  I have thought about it and feel that I haven't been as red pill as i should be in this.  I feel that subconsciously, she isn't responding to me like she used to and that speaks alot on me.  grad school took alot out of me but i'm in the homestretch and i have more free time.   

The red pill side of me says that i should just tell her to go explore and really show her that I won't take any more of this disrespect she is showing me.  While the other part of me, and that I won't have the abilities to move on from this and that I won't find someone to replace her.  To be honest, TRP is the best thing I've ever found but changing your old ways and habits is one hell of a tough thing to do, especially when those fears kick in at inconvenient times.

I've been beta for a large part of my life, but I need to be more alpha to keep her, because we've both talked about having kids, traveling the world, etc and we both want those things, yet for the past 7 months, those feelings have faded from her.  We even discussed looking at wedding rings (I know, by being more alpha.

Looking at this with this kind of girl in mind, more experienced red pillers, establish more alpha dominance in this situation?

I realize that alot of you will tell me to ditch her (and I am prepared to do it), planning on reading books, and going out with friends so i can find out who I am as well.

I hope that you guys will give me some good advice on this because I want to grow and be better out of this situation as well

The first thing I noticed when I got here was how full of advice this subreddit is. Stuffed full of game and advice on Why women act the way they do and Why game counteracts it. This is the difference between the RedPill and Seddit. We deal with the root problem. And trust me

The second thing I noticed was the seeming anger and resentment that could present itself here. It would appear like a bunch of women hating misogynists got together, I made a post asking to drop the Us Vs Them mentality. In the comments that followed, I learned a Lot.

1. This Is Not Seddit:

	Like I said, in fact we're not even upset. We're becoming strangely good at a sexual strategy, and we're using evolutionary theory to lead the way. We're very similar to Seddit on that front, except we take a different approach. We want to understand why women act and think the way they do.”

2. This Is Not Sugar Coated:

	One thing you have to realize is that what you consider correct is in fact dictated a lot by what Feminists consider correct. We are not equal to women. The Red Pill is about realizing that men and women are Different. 

    To quote zionController a la Morpheous, you look around, what do you see? Businessmen, teachers, lawyers, carpenters. The very minds of the people we are trying to save. But until we do, these people are still a part of that system and that makes them our enemy. You have to understand, so hopelessly dependent on the system

3. This Is TheRedPill:

	Take a moment and ponder this. “Why do we need game?”.

	We need game because the system is backwards. Women reward Alpha Males (read: Jerks) with sex. Women reward Beta Males (read: “nice guys”) with nothing. Then

**Blog**: Delicious Tacos

**Example Post**: His best shit is fun, and very not boring. When he sits down to write, it's like he's questioning the post that wants to be written, as if to say: prove yourself to me that you're not some stupid bullshit that no one wants to read, and that everybody's already heard a million times.

Some good examples are his [Relax

He's a writer who's in touch with the depressing, optimism is annoying and usually stems from denial. 

I'm not saying you should wallow in it, well, that realization is freeing... if/when you can climb out of the pit of despair it puts you in.

That's all folks.

I've done a lot of reading over the past couple years, and start taking action. 

Embrace the inevitable boredom and frustration that comes from too much theory and not enough practice. Your yin needs some yang.

Quit porn. Limit masturbation. Limit internet. 

Too much sitting on your ass and not enough smacking dat ass. Too much fingering keys and not enough fingering clits. Too much holding devices and not enough holding titties. You get the idea...

Put a hard limit on your time spent in virtual worlds, TV, internet, video games and porn. But that's good. That will motivate you to make the real world fun again. Which takes effort, yes, but it's more rewarding, because you've just tricked yourself into being human and living life.

* Find your target

* Initiate conversation

Direct approach vs indirect approach? Doesn't matter. Do whatever makes you comfortable. Stupid conversation starters are fine too. ""Hey whats the time?"" ""What are you reading there? ""Whats your name?"" Rhetoric statements are fine too. ""You smell good!"" ""I like your dress"". Doesn't really matter TBH. Just talk!! Most introverts including me dont like to talk to girls because 99% of the times they talk asinine bullshit. I like to have stimulating conversations but the truth is interesting people are few and far between. But hey, intellect and then determine if they are compatible with me.

* Isolate her

If shes with friend/s isolate her. If shes alone great!! If not

* Get her number

Get her number after the chit-chat. No need to ask permission

* Set a date 

Set a date preferably near the weekend. Ask her what her plans are for the week. If shes open

* The date

Congrats you got the date. Don't go out for dinner etc. A girls inner whore will kick in. Avoid any veneue where you'll have to spend money on her. Keep it playful and cost effective as possible. Date is a perfect way to get a kiss close. The easiest way to eat her mouth is to do kino first. You will literally feel the electric tension when you touch her. Get close to her

* In conclusion

Keep it simple. Introverts think a lot so don't over-think anything and go with the fucking flow. If you find your wife using this method

Guess what? She and her husband were trying to get pregnant three months ago! And they were successful.

I'm not sure if it was biological or what but it's pretty amazing to see how a woman changes when she is receptive to becoming pregnant. And it probably also explains the apparent mate guarding behaviour I saw from her husband the night I dropped her off.

I found out yesterday, I enjoy the attention. I don't reciprocate the attention much so I don't feel like I'm doing anything wrong. I think she enjoys doing stuff for me and gets her emotional/hypergamy needs fulfilled.

1373817714.0,1ia3xs,Exploration of RedPill Ideas,noPTSDformePlease,46,23,36,"A couple of things that I've been thinking about over the past couple of days.

First, so I get a lot of female attention: Sergeant of Marines, leader of men, muscular, well educated, very social and I get along with everyone and am able to converse about pretty much anything with anyone. I make eye contact and strike up conversations with everyone and am able to read social situations like a fucking book. It might sound like I'm bragging, but I wasn't always this way. I'm 27 and have spent the majority of my life working towards self-actualization. I'm pretty proud of my accomplishments but I'm also aware that there is much for me to improve upon.

I found the redpill about a month or two ago and it agrees with much of what I already knew and believed. The discussion here is good and many threads explore topics in detail that aren't explored anywhere else. Overall

And yet there is a lot that doesn't fit in with my experiences in real life. In this thread lets discuss any issues/ideas that still need to be further developed. 

One thing that seems to be ignored is the fact that it is not just women who conduct shit tests, because of its negative conotations) in order to figure out where in the social hierarchy they fall compared to you. If you pass their tests, then you are ranked higher then them. If you fail, then you are ranked lower. Nobody wants to be friends with someone who is too much lower then them, because it brings down their own percieved value, and everyone wants to be friends with someone who is higher then themselves because it makes their own value higher by association. The crazy and wonderful part about this is that other people notice if you pass or fail. This is why social proof is so powerful: If someone (man or woman) sees you pass a beautiful woman's shit test, they subconsciously think: ""huh. that guy is ranked higher in the social hierchy than that beautiful woman

an example is when I was at my friends house the other day at a BBQ. I was playing catch with his 6 year old son in the backyard and every so often he would get super excited, seeing what he could get away with. Or, in other terms, conducting a shit test on me. Every time this happened I was firm with him, saying ""no, you have to throw it back nice"" and making him go get the ball and throw it back right. Interestingly he loved the fact that I had boundaries and kept coming back to me throughout the evening asking if I wanted to play with him again. His mom, my friend's wife, and she has started throwing interest indicators my way. Subtle ones

Which brings me to the next topic i want to discuss: How to deal with women who want you but you have no desire for. I literally want nothing to do with his wife. I've got a lot of respect for him and won't do anything to jeopardize his marriage. My current strategy for dealing with her is basically to just ignore the fuck out of her. I am polite and say hello, I'd love to hear them.

There are a couple of other ideas that need further developing here on the redpill that I'm aware of but this post is getting long and I don't want to dilute the discussion by presenting too many of them at once. If there is good discussion here

1373139098.0,1hrgw0,How men and women dress at the gym and why,GayLubeOil,57,35,57,"Iv worked as a personal trainer for several years

[The Plain Clothes Man:](http://i01.i.aliimg.com/img/pb/265/337/433/433337265_047.jpg) Most men fall into this category. They wear loose fitting white t shirts and shorts. The colors they wear are White Blue Black or Grey. They wear cheap clothes that they don't care about and are not afraid of them getting sweaty. Thier goal is to go to the gym get a good workout and leave even if they aren't the most knowledgeable at what they are doing they still strain and push themselves.

[The Bodybuilder/Gym Bro:](http://www.riptclothing.com/skin/frontend/base/theme147/images/bodybuilding-vest.jpg) Unlike the affer mentioned this group intentionally expose their muscles in loose fitting tank tops or cut offs. The reason for this is once you get larger you heat up more easily. Your biceps and lats rub together if you wear a conventional t-shirt. You can get a better pump if you focus on your muscles in the mirror and squeeze at maximum contraction. Contrary to feminist belief

[The Homosexual who is looking:](http://bodysphere.de/images/C-IN2_SS13_3467_green-flash_F_zen_mens_clothing_shirt_tank_top_squaretank.jpg) Not all homosexuals fall into this category many fall into the previous two. However it should be be no surprise that gyms are major gay meetup spots. Arnold's Gold Gym was filled with homosexuals and was a major pickup spot for gay prostitutes. This category of gym goer wears tight fitting bright clothes that out him as gay to other gays. Often this group of people is more concerned about their appearance than a good workout. However that is understandable considering that they are predominantly there to meet other men

[Plain Jane](http://www.buzzle.com/img/articleImages/301521-50728-48.jpg): Often overweight or clueless about working out. Plain Jane wears plain clothes so no one will notice her while she works out. Often overweight plain Jane is  embarrassed about not fitting in at the gym. The last thing Plain Jane wants is male attention at the gym. +1 Point for trying -1 for not having an effective plan. 

[The Attention seeker:](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSC3NdIpQHkCk1Li9Qe-kFfBkwwovkxzGb4G_IpQdm2gL9tDGSqfg): Most women at the gym who are sexualy fertile fall into this category. Their Clothing is bright and tight similar to the homosexual. They have no idea what the fuck they are doing from a fitness standpoint and yes that is my professional opinion as a certified personal trainer. The gym now a days

[The Hardcore Gym Girl:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTEJ-Ec9XOE) These are the only women I have any respect for at the gym. If you are reading this and your a woman, Squated 180? No? Then this is not you and I don't want to hear your rationalization about how your an exception because you played volley ball and volleyball is hard. The hardcore gym girl is focused, motivated and has an effective plan on how to improve her body. Often but not always the hardcore girl has a boyfriend/man that pushed her to success in spite of the bullshit of mainstream Bosu Ball fitness and all of the stupidity her friends have to say on the subject:Lifting makes you bulky etc.

1372870386.0,1hkrmj,Thoughts on teasing.,yankeetiger,42,16,11,"I've long been told that teasing is such an important tool in the attractive man's arsenal of game. It's the alpha's multitool in social interactions. Some of the reasons I've considered are that it establishes sexual tension

The problem is, I decided to break down the art of teasing and classify types of teasing so that they'd become more accessible in the moment:

* *Setting unreasonable standards*
* *Obfuscating*
* *Situational criticism*
* *Hyperbole*


**Setting unreasonable standards** is a way of informing a woman that you must be of such high value

*""I only like girls who can recite the Pledge of Allegiance while unicycling across the Grand Canyon. So is this gonna work out or not?""*

**Obfuscating** is intentionally causing confusion in an attempt to differentiate oneself from the mass of beta men who engage in boring conversation

*""Excuse me

**Situational criticism** is probably what would be considered the classic tease. Using the circumstances to point out something you don't approve of in a way that's lighthearted

*""I really like that dress! My mother has one just like it.""*

**Hyperbole** is just exaggerating- the often mentioned ""agree and amplify"". It communicates to a woman that you don't take her inquiries seriously, means that you've got better things to do with your time.

*""You look so young!""
""I know


I would really like EC's and the redpill community at large to weigh in here and let me know where this could be improved and built upon.

I officially joined the seduction community in the summer of 2007 when I separated from my wife that spring. I was looking online for tips on how to break the ice and had no knowledge of the seduction community at that time. (it was still underground, so this is saying something! 

When I was going out on the weekends I was dabbling with things I read in the book, time to go balls to the wall' effect to why I got as good as I did so quickly. 

Back in the early days, which IMO was largely derivative, but did have an incredible breadth of information for those still using structured game (following a model and using canned lines and routines). Then came RSD and some others who introduced us to ""natural"" game. Since that time I've seen a variety of changes in the community, with a lot of revolving door aspects. One standout was AFC Adam who really helped reshape my style of game. The model he introduced me to closely matched how I naturally interacted with women and it's what I've stuck with ever since more or less, largely because it allows me to be ""normal"". The only time I really think back to the structure he presented in class is when I go blank or run into a tricky situation that's not heading in the direction I want it to. 

Back in the day, and then you've got more holistic approaches by typically one-off companies most people have never heard of (and guys like myself). The focus of this latter segment of the community is to ""skill up"" students' social attributes, get them experience using some structured material, and then put them on a self-improvement path so 6 months down the road they're not one of those guys who gets a girlfriend while still on the training wheels (routines et al) and then she dumps him when he runs out of material. 

I eventually got my skills where I wanted them, have been active in the SoSuave community, and a variety of community forums. If you look back through my old posts you can see how I evolved. I'm still active in the local community, but I've pushed back from the table. These days my interests are more in teaching newbies, men's issues, and the manosphere in general. I'm also currently dating a former model/child actor 13 years younger than myself. (yay for matching SMV!). I take that former model part back, she just did a gig for Paul Mitchell a few weeks ago.  Anyway, The Attraction Vault, and was in on the ground floor when Rollo started up Rational Male. I'm also a fan of Athol Kay's blog and book.

Just to reiterate, and introduce them to Red Pill philosophies and what's essentially our sidebar material.

If you were to extrapolate these to a relationship, and we frequently discuss things on the team regarding women, and very open about his lifestyle at home (which is actually very Red-Pill

Over the course of several weeks, she has been married (no children) which ended in a divorce when she was quite young (24-27, haven’t asked/don’t care for specifics, but I do know it lasted 9 months) to which she rationalised the failure to “I was too young, and wanted to be married”, although she had actually never lived with her husband in a house prior to getting married. She had a house with him, but as far as I know, who she dumped after going through his phone and seeing texts to other women, Nice Guy; more on him later) who got in touch with her out of the blue via a long four-page email confessing/explaining/white-knighting/self-hating, not creepy. The guy works in banking and earns roughly 10x her annual wage (we’re bordering on £200k a year with all his bonuses in check)

So

* A trip to Vegas, yada-yada-yada.
The trip to America will continue for around two weeks whilst she goes around Arizona/Nevada sight-seeing.
* A house (£250k) of which at least £125k has been put down as a deposit. (Not by her, something important about that, she tells me/us that she “likes her space”, therefore (hamster) the house has four bedrooms so she can go off and be on her own sometimes, and in addition to that, most weekends he will be out at the football, allowing her free time to herself. I swear these words have actually come out of her mouth.
* She will get his old car as he will get a new company-car due to a promotion. She is also pushing for a convertible “whilst we’re still young”, to give you an idea that she’s living quite vicariously.

Now, indicating a want for spending/possessions to be equal. The latter received the response “I’d give it him, but divorce him afterwards, because you need trust for a marriage, and if there’s no trust, then there cannot be a happy marriage”; dat logic. That was despite my protestations about men ‘never knowing 100%’, and also bringing up that babies can be mixed at the hospital, the unfairness of having to pay for a child that is not biologically bound

There was some clever hamstering going on here. Firstly, where she classified ‘types of women liable to do x/y/z and what x/y/z should/could do in return), and regarding the baby-swapping, she actually brought examples up of several soap-operas where this has happened… but then quickly changed the subject and walked off before I could say ‘well, that could happen’.

Now, and she must leave the house, i.e. she cannot claim squatters rights, or say “but, but I *live* here!” in an attempt to stay/claim something. She’s not happy with this, and let slip at the start of the week with the following story.

Her husband-to-be is a die-hard football/soccer supporter, and you’re lucky if you can get one (even if you have the cash). He goes every week he can, and to the additional matches for cups, etc. Always has. 

So, where he decided to drink and eat what he wanted with his mates. He declined to ring her back, and stayed out for quite a while whilst she has at home ‘waiting for him’. He gets home late, with a takeaway, and she’s angry, but really only because he didn’t have the stones to tell her to STFU. He slunk out of things by saying “oh, well I don’t know if we’re going to ‘x’ pub yet”, because she said “you should have seen the look on his face!” She said it as if she was proud of this.

I proceeded to question her regarding him and what I believed she’s taken for granted. She maintains this air of worthiness, I’d tell her that her current/future lifestyle would not be possible if it wasn’t for his wage, and that she should actually be very respectful about him/to him regarding this, and let him do whatever it is he wants. Of course, because he’s so Blue-Pill she knows that she’s onto a winner here (oh irony!), due to his spongy backbone. I’ve also got information regarding him; he’s had an overbearing mother (a Jewish mother, and I’m not being anti-Semitic with that remark

So, she doesn’t know I browse TRP whilst at work, she doesn’t know I know what she’s doing, and neither does she (well, not totally). What I am seeing is The Hypergamess at work here, and it’s never been more true to me. Just thought I’d share my musings and findings without having been on the receiving end of it.

&gt;But this does not address the fairly glaring concern of why there is such a preference in long-form drama for male protagonists. After all, ambivalent behavior.

However

&gt;The reason could hardly be more apparent, much less one with whom you are expected to sympathize.

A woman in power who likes to (promiscuously) fuck isn't untenable; she is merely unattractive to men. Her power over men clashes with their biological desire for a submissive wife; her promiscuity is unappealing because it signifies a greater possibility of being cuckolded. It is as if McGreevy has forgotten that the purpose of television is to attract more viewers for commercials

&gt;Granted, but these are comedies, where the double standard is less pronounced (somewhat).

Inverting gender roles by placing females into masculine positions, in this case the reality that men are the motor that turns the world. Women are, at best, the grease.

&gt;Try to come up with a dramatic female lead who is permitted to be a selfish piece of shit in the same league as her masculine equivalent and still be relatable and you come up dry. Having written a novel that hinges on the machinations of a violent

 I was wondering if people that saw the movie could comment on what they  saw and what their reactions were. Some of the conclusions and rules I made connections with were:

1.Romance is a male conception.

*Gatsby comes back from the war

2.Women change their mind depending on the the feeling you give them.

*When Gatsby is taking daisy around his mansion and showering her with all sorts of clothes and experiences

3.Women have a high attraction to those men that other women are attracted to 

*Daisy's main dude

*The first man to say ""I love you"" looses. The scene with the whiskey drinking in New York

5.Do too much and you will become beta suplicative

*The scene where Daisy and Gatsby meet again after 5 years

And the biggest one of all

6.Man cannot be in love

*He was the go to man, point a finger and its done, man of all men. Then came along Daisy and he fell back in love with her, all his drive disappeared, all of his moxy faded, infact the movie demonstrated this fact succinctly; his house dimmed, the parties stopped and the he fired his staff so that no one knew what they were doing.

I've talked to many friends and people. Even rockstars, I know of who is dating a model, has consciously made an effort to date more girls, and make sure he is not falling to hard for her; this guy is still partying and being adventurous with me

A naive man will look at that and say what I'm suggesting is extremely exhausting and is just plain old dishonest. A red piller or anyone with common sense should be wiser.  

They're playing a role not for the sake of lying
and perceive them how they want. They're playing a role to make you fulfill the duties they wish. 

Let's picture a very promiscuous woman. She can tell you about all the fucking and sucking she's done
This applies to both genders. Telling you might trigger a fight

They need to do it.

One needs to accept that chances are you won't see her true self

This bring me to my next point. 

Ever noticed how some women will turn into sex freaks with some guys and with some relationship types will carry themselves like dick doesn't cross their mind?

There a choice there

This is for anyone whose not up to speed on this.

- I'm 99.9% sure I'm a sigma whose ""alpha manifestation"" is wolf alpha. Ian Ironwood's articles were awesome (thanks u/roe_).  

- Some of my problems come from the fact that I was raised primarily by my mother. I need to start bonding more with my father and guy friends, u/iamme2 and others).   

- When it comes to selecting non-LTR female partners

- I will be working on my game this summer. I'm a lot less hesitant now that I realize that game is not just purely to bag ONS's. The Real Social Dynamics Youtube channel seems pretty awesome and helpful
 

  
So thanks a lot everyone

Hello all. So I've been lurking here for a bit and decided to post. I've been reading a lot of the sidebar literature (e.g. Involuntary Celibate) and it intrigued me
  
I'm a 22 year old heterosexual male, 188 lbs.). I'm funny and incredibly smart (graduated top of my class for both of my bachelor's degrees; currently pursuing a biochemistry PhD). I can sometimes be a bit socially awkward, mostly because I don't care to learn the rules/conventions rather than that I am weird and incapable of being social.    
  
Anyway, promiscuous girl that came on to me. I was without sex for quite some time and I just went with it. I didn't always enjoy being FwB with my last sexual partner either. She is a shitty person but was super hot and gave the best BJs ever. So me thinking she sucked as a person (read: she's a huge cunt) helped me want to just fuck her and not connect with her - so I rationalized by degradation I guess. Between every sexual partner, I spend about a year or so without any sex. I usually have a drunk hook-up or two in there, but I'm usually so drunk that I can't get it up and we just give each other half-assed oral. But it's not because I can't get a girl to have sex with. I just don't really look for it or care to pursue anybody. I'm attractive enough that I could easily pick up a girl with a little time and investment in learning ""game."" But I just don't care. I wait until something just pops up. That was the story of the FwB. I can't get sexually excited about dumb girls that are super hot...I in theory want to fuck them silly, but when it gets down to it, I just don't have a sexual reaction to them. The FwB seemed to be pretty smart and she was pretty forward about her attraction. I made all the moves and got a good FwB. I would invite her over between classes, fuck her silly for thirty minutes
  
I was sexually unsatisfied in my last two LTRs (beta of me I guess?)
  
So basically I don't know where I fit in the classifications put forth by TheRedPill...I wouldn't say I'm alpha or beta. And I don't have trouble getting sex (such as the guy in ""Reformed Incel"")
  

  
EDIT 1: (Quoting myself from a comment below) I'm just a man that has tried many, I should at least have the desire to have it. I've explored all the reasons and came to the conclusion that it has to be about my outlook on sex and relationships and potentially (as I mentioned in my other comment replies) some kind of weird social confidence issue. That is why I turned to this subreddit, to see if maybe the problem lies in my outlook on sex and relationships between man and woman.  
  
EDIT 2: (As pointed out by mmj4mil that it seems like I'm qualifying myself to you guys; quoting myself here) I have read a lot of the posts on this subreddit, body type, etc. So that's why I did it - to avoid future clarification. It wasn't to make myself more attractive in the eyes of TRP.",Ask Red Pill,False,,t5_2ve1u,askrp,http://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedPill/comments/1dwnrg/i_would_appreciate_your_thoughts_on_memy_sexual/

Trying to see if I played this right

Saturday night, but a lot of fun but a bunch of baggage that made me friendzone her, still good dhv) we are bouncing around a few bars and end up at a rather nice one in a boutique hotel.

After meeting some people, I notice a decent girl sitting alone on a couch. My friend heads to the loo and I engage. 

Playful banter, mentions she lives about an hour away and is not staying in the city tonight (no SNL), but I hit a bump when she suggests going back into the loud bar to get a drink. I calmy say why don't we stay here and get to know each other better ( bar is loud, the couchs in the lobby are quiet) chat for a few more, and she says again let's get a drink. My friend is done, and motioning to head back in so I agree. We escalate kino, her arm around me as we push our way through the crowd at the bar. She asks me what I would like to drink, nice interest and we seem to be having a good time. Bartender finishes the drinks, why are you not paying? 

She gives me a look that could be best described as a snarl, I was always taught who does the inviting pays. I simply then say, maybe it is like that in your culture (she had said earlier she is American, but philipino and Mexican) why don't I just pay for mine and you pay for yours?

To this a get a look that is best described as disgusted shock

I apologize to the bartender, and give him a tip close to the value of the wasted drink (I come here enough that I want to bartender to know I am not screwing him) and continue on with my night. I have a good time with the rest of the evening, and see her later with some guy that has paid for her drink(s), but she is clearly not interested, shooting daggers at me each time I pass. 

This amuses me greatly. 

Few things to keep in mind, getting a hotel room in SF on a Saturday night is $200+ so a SNL unless the girl lives in SF is not going to happen. Best I was hoping for was a number and/or a kiss.

I have several other plates in the air so no big deal on this one

What should I have done different? 

Tl;DR Girl gets pissed off and walks away when I don't pay for her drink after she invites me to come with her to the bar. This amuses me as her radiations are shocked that her looks aren't getting her expensive drinks for nothing.

1367693841.0,1dovzd,The Importance of Confidence.,Gentle-Mang,38,15,28,"The fact is that the silver bullet, is confidence. That's why PUA works

I used to be very depressed and have very low self esteem

**Circumstantial confidence**

This form of confidence is rooted in your possessions and achievements and comparing them to other people's possessions and achievements. You feel like a boss when you're walking around in a nice suit, ripped abs, or you have a hot girlfriend, you're in a cool band or whatever. These things give you validation, you feel good about yourself and that which is yours.

If you are starting from nothing, I recommend putting effort into improving your circumstances so that you can attain this kind of confidence. Solve your problems one at a time. Start lifting and the hormones released from that will lift your mood and give you the energy to make other changes, do some PUA, have new experiences and expand your comfort zone.

There are problems with this kind of confidence though. 

Firstly it is situational, in the store you are the boss, you are the alpha male... outside of the store you're just some guy, nobody gives a shit. You can be the owner of a successful business, a self-made man. You go to a nightclub and you will still feel anxious about approaching some hot girl who probably only works as a hairdresser. How does that make any sense?

Second problem is if your circumstances change for the worse, and once it disappeared they lost their self esteem along with everything else.

Third problem is that no matter how nice your stuff is, because all of that stuff is just a facade. You see celebrities who have everything, fame, fortune, riches... and yet they still have mental breakdowns. Why aren't these people happy when they have so much? Clearly there's more to it than that.

I think that circumstantial confidence is a good stepping stone

**Inner confidence**

You came into this world as a happy little baby. You were happy and confident in learning to walk and talk no matter how many times you fucked up. Then one day you were in the playground playing with a ball and little Timmy came over, and the things that you saw were your possessions and achievements, thus they became the basis of your confidence as described above. This is called the ego. ""I'm so much better than that asshole Timmy because I have this cool toy car, fuck Timmy and his bullshit"" you said when you were 4 years old. ""Ha, look at Timmy now driving a forklift while I have this sweet job with my own office and future prospects"" you said at 25...

But here's the revelation that blew my mind when I had it. We as people have the inherent right to be happy and confident regardless of our circumstances

The ego is the scar tissue that surrounds our emotional wounds, so does everyone else.

Acceptance of yourself and being a genuine motherfucker is the key to deep-rooted unshakable confidence. It frees you of dependence on circumstances and outcomes because you don't need validation from anything outside of yourself. You have no reason to be needy or insecure, social and romantic endeavors.

There's no instant solution to attaining this, ""I'm so much better than Timmy, because I've achieved true inner confidence and he hasn't"" - no. You need to learn to recognize the ego if it resurfaces.

**Transcending the self**

I will only mention that I think that there's a level beyond what I've described above that is an even deeper and more robust form of confidence

**tl;dr: Being confident because of the stuff you have or the things you have done is okay
