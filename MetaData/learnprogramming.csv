I want to do something more ambitious

I would be live streaming the entire process from start to finish, logistics, setting up servers, etc. 

I feel this would be valuable both for those who are looking to obtain real employment in programming related fields

I have seen a lot of coding tutorials online

So after some prompting from my wife

* I almost never lecture.
* Students learn programming by DOING it.
* They work through the assignments at their own pace.
* Each assignment is only SLIGHTLY harder than the previous one.
* The concepts move at normal person speed.
* Hopefully the programs are at least *somewhat* interesting.

Anyway

My assignments are at [programmingbydoing.com](http://programmingbydoing.com/).

(And my knowledge of all this is fuzzy). Even at the basic level, so many lines of codes, all comes down to series of zeros and ones. They are meaningless in themselves yet somehow we can arrange them in a meaningful way to produce something that we can understand and manipulate.

Then you get to graphics, creating variables, defining them, doing this and that, rendering this, and then finally to display it on the screen with each individual pixel with a certain color that can change at many times per second. It completely blows my mind.

The more I learn, and that it's so complicated, I feel like I will never fully understand the process, only parts of it. The idea that binary code can be arranged in such a way to provide all the games, programs and things we use everything on the internet is just unbelievable. We are truly the smartest monkeys on the block.

Anyways

EDIT: I made this thread last night at around this time and I'm amazed how much you guys responded in that time. Since last night, logic gates, and now going to half adders, full adders, compliments, and now learning about feedback, basic set and reset memory. OMFG MEMORY!!!!!

Its very early on and I am just getting started on the game but I was hoping to get some feedback from people who are interested in learning JS so that I can try and make the game more approachable

The game itself is open source and you can also view and learn from all the game code at the link above or fork it and use it to make your own games.

1363814905.0,1aotxk,18 months ago I didn't know there was something called programming language. Last month got an internship offer and recently got hired as junior developer. Thank you guys - you made it possible for me ! ,ShermanMG,706,121,88," I really want to thank you guys what you are doing here.
I wanted to say this place is one of the least where people are really helpful and with nice attitude towards eachother. 

Thanks to you I was able to turn around my career. I've lost almost 3 years of my life studying things I didn't like and was really depressed about it. Then I learned about programming and loved it right away. Thanks to this subreddit I was able to learn so many things and was saved so much time


Ps.Sorry for any mistakes and grammar . I am so happy right now I cannot focus on  proper words !

Not sure if this is the correct subreddit. If I'd get a better answer from another one

So specifically what I'm talking about are game trailers, but more along the line of game trailers and animation. Am I correct in saying that those are created using CGI and the likes of that, or is it something else?

Whichever it is, if I remained interested in it. Is there any book or online introductory course on either a programming language I need to know before I even get started with the actual CGI (or whatever it is if I was wrong above) or the CGI itself that you would recommend? Are there any college or online courses that would be a good introduction? I figure if I can get started with it I would be able to find the right path towards a major in the respective field I'm talking about. I've done a bit of research already but it's kind of difficult to find a starting point and I would rather get a recommendation from someone who already knows what they're doing rather than just google.

Basically what I'm asking is for a starting point in CGI, I'd appreciate it even more. If there's a website that's a good introduction you can just link me that, but even after a bit of research on my end, I'm still a little unsure of where I should start. And again, if this isn't the correct subreddit, please send to the appropriate one. Sorry for the unorganized post, but as you can tell, but I am willing to try hard. I have a whole Summer to see how far I can go in learning the basics. Thanks in advance :)

EDIT: Just read the FAQ and noticed the programming subreddit. If you really recommend I go there for help, it'd be a great help. I'll probably end up asking there eventually.

EDIT2: Thank you so much for the responses guys! Really appreciate them and am taking them all into consideration :)

irc://irc.undernet.org/bookz

irc://irc.irchighway.net/ebooks

If you don't know how to use IRC to download books

&amp;gt;*IRC Guide*

&amp;gt;You obviously need an IRC client installed

&amp;gt;Load up the client and then type:

&amp;gt;/server irc.irchighway.net



&amp;gt;This will connect you to the irchighway server. Once you're on there

&amp;gt;/join #ebooks



&amp;gt;This will take you into the ebooks channel

&amp;gt;@search ""Author or book title""



&amp;gt;... removing the inverted commas.


&amp;gt;You'll get a message saying that your search has been accepted. A few seconds later a searchbot will offer you a file

&amp;gt;Say I wanted to download the first book. I'd copy the text shown below

&amp;gt;!bald Lian Hearn - [Tales Of The Otori 02] - Grass For His Pillow .rar



&amp;gt;Then just paste that into the IRC window then press enter. After 2-3 seconds you get a prompt asking you to accept or decline the file.You know how to do the rest.

1333484920.0,rrpak,"My advice to new programmers, so we can avoid ""I am a new programmer, where do I start ?"" threads every two days.",add7,553,96, where all newbies can find guidance. 

Here we go.

Most popular languages:

* Java
* C
* C++
* Python
* C#
* Objective-C
* Ruby
* Perl

[quoted from [LINK](http://www.tiobe.com/index.php/content/paperinfo/tpci/index.html)]

So what should you learn as your first language:

Well

**Python** is always a popular suggestion to new programmers

The most widely suggested links are: 

[Learn Python The Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/)

If you are into game development: [Invent Your Own Computer Games With Python](http://inventwithpython.com/)

Then there is **Java**. It's a little hard to start with at first, there is a lot of stuff you won't understand at the start, because as a newbie you don't need to know that yet and it'll be very confusing (e.g. what is main method ? what is class ? why do we need void ? and such..). 

Where to learn Java:

I would strongly recommend The New Boston tutorials. This guy makes one the best tutorials on the web. [Java tutorial.](http://thenewboston.org/list.php?cat=31)

And of course the ""official"" tutorials from Oracle: [Tutorials.](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/)

And the third one on my list

*Do you really want to learn programming but have no skill? Are you a system administrator who wants to learn Puppet or Chef? Are you a designer who wants to build your own websites? Are you a Ruby on Rails programmer who's ashamed that you don't really know Ruby? Then you should read this book. It assumes absolutely no prior programming knowledge and will guide you carefully and slowly through the learning process.* [quoted from ""Learn Ruby The Hard Way""]

To learn Ruby this would be most useful links:

[Learn Ruby The Hard Way](http://ruby.learncodethehardway.org/)

[Try Ruby In Your Browser](http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0)

[Why's \(Poignant\) Guide to Ruby](http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/book/chapter-1.html)

1351460868.0,128lzm,I want to really dig into programming but I am feeling a bit overwhelmed.,Glothr,618,167,628,"Sorry my title is vague. I didn't quite know how to put it. Over the last few months I've started to dip my feet into programming by using the Code Academy website. I started with JavaScript and liked it a lot. I didn't finish all the courses for it at CA yet because I took a short hiatus from programming due to other things coming up. 

Recently I've wanted to get back into programming in general. I started doing the Python and HTML/CSS courses at Code Academy but haven't gotten very far in either. I think I'm most interested in writing apps for smartphones and simpler 2D video games and such to start. I like the idea of coming up for an idea for an app

What worries me is that I read posts here and I am absolutely lost in the amount of technical jargon and such. More than jargon I am worried about the mathematical aspects of programming. I've struggled for most of my educational career up to and including my 2 years at a local college with anything beyond advanced algebra. I've changed a lot since then as far as how I think so I might just have to give it another try. Can anyone give me some insight into what level of math I should be proficient in or expected to be proficient in if I want to go anywhere with programming?",,t5_2r7yd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/128lzm/i_want_to_really_dig_into_programming_but_i_am/

I think if there's a high enough demographic I can spend maybe a few hours a day going through it.

I'm a pretty good programmer, like those which are most frequently on this subreddit, but maybe around 90% of the kids in my class still handle everything through the main() method).

So yeah.  Let me know if you're interested.  I'll go over the details of the game if I get positive feedback.

The position is in a really great medium sized software company that uses Java as their primary development language.  This was my second interview (first was with HR

1. What kind of data structure would you use to hold an arbitrary amount of objects in which retrieval is not an issue?  

2. Follow up: what are the advantages and disadvantages of using a linked list over a dynamic array structure? [good time to talk about Big-O performance]

3. Describe the main properties of a binary search tree.

4.  What would happen if you inserted a sorted list into a binary search tree?

5.  Follow up: how can you avoid this problem?

6. Say you want to retrieve from a data set a person's name based on an alphanumeric ID number.  What kind of data structure would you use?

7.  Compare a hash table and a map type structure and their big-O performance on various common functionality (search

8.  What is the worst case retrieval time for a hash table and how can this happen?

9.  Briefly describe object oriented programming and it's main principles (MAKE SURE TO SAY: encapsulation, (and abstraction if you want)).

10.  He specifically asked me to elaborate more on encapsulation and polymorphism.

11.  Why is polymorphism useful?

He then asked me if I had done any multithreading, which I have done a little. For SQL questions he asked:

12. What is a join and an outer join? 

Despite not knowing 12 and not doing any multithreading

I think my situation is unique and many budding programmers will find my profile interesting/helpful in context:

I have a BA in philosophy from the University of Michigan

On my resume I put the projects I've worked on

I've spent a LOT of time outside of class programming on my own and hammering in concepts that I may have missed by not completing a full CS degree.

1358280744.0,16mxpr,My 1 year experience from internship to full time job.,viceflow,368,38,144,"So here's my story :

When I was 25 back in 2008 I decided to get a bachelor degree in Computer Science. At that time I was working as a Front Desk clerk for a resort here in Cancun. So I managed to convince my boss to let me study in the mornings and work on the evening. So basically I was in school through the morning and then to work.

Four years passed and its 2012. Got my bachelor degree and really wanted to leave the front desk job and start taking advantage from my degree. My main goal since I started university was to learn to code

So as I was saying , I wanted to code and build software, the only problems was that most companies needed at least 3 year experience... fuck my life.So I made a huge decision and started to look for a internship somewhere in Cancun... I started to send emails to a few companies (to my surprise there's around 8 software companies down here) . 1 week later I got an email back from one of them, they ask me if I could come over for an Interview. Feeling nervous and dumb there I went.. lol I remember they ask me to do two exercises... the first one was to take any kind of string and reverse it.. without using functions...(they use Java) the other I don't remember cause I fail miserably on both... I got to nervous and couldn't think of a solution...  bummer. They said....thank you.. we will call you, ouch.

A month pass by and suddenly I got another email. Another company , they ask me to do online test's for basic and some advance C# features + TSQL. I didn't fail miserably but got enough basic concepts to got me another interview. 

The interview goes pretty good, on the internship place I convince them to let me work from 9 to 2pm even without pay, they agree and still pay me. For 4 months I spend all day working like literally ,I started the internship at 9am then rush out at 2pm and start at 3pm at the resort were I leave at 11pm. 

This was from Monday to Friday. So as you can imagine I started to feel miserably.

On the other hand... I was learning a lot.

Right away I get my hands on books 

They put me on a MVC4 project that was going to start from zero. The project leader was kind enough to go easy on me and started to explain everything... so there I was learning Entity Framework, Moq,SCRUM  .... at some point my brain almost explode from all that information.

One day I talk to the wife and decided to leave the front desk job. This was like 4 months into the internship 

As you can imagine I pass the certification and land me the full time job.

Its been almost 1 year since I decided to do a complete change on my life. I think it was a good decision.

So far I been working with ASP, Jquery, JavaScript, Unit Test,Reporting Services  and hope to get a new certification in a couple of months in HTML 5, CSS3 and JavaScript.

So 

Beers on [me](http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/116/154/DUANE.gif)

My sincere apologies for my broken English

**TL; DR I went from a Front desk clerk to Developer in 4 years and how perseverance land me an internship in a software company** 

** EDIT **

Thank you all for taking the time to read my story. I feel very humble reading everything here.

In my experience at least with C#/.NET this things help me a lot :

[Plural Sight](http://www.pluralsight.com/training)
Lots of videos of pretty much anything related with .NET with examples.

[Code School](http://www.codeschool.com)
This help me to learn HTML5,JavaScript... and they have great courses on other topics(Ruby,Git)

[MSDN] (http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/)
The oficcial .ne documentation. Everything is here.

[Code Project] (http://www.codeproject.com)

Nice blog with examples

[Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)
Always a starting point if you feel lost through a project or how to do x task.

Like I said previously you are never to old to learn and apply something new. Life is funny on how the decisions that you make change everything. Something that I realize now that I'm close to 30 is that you need to plan ahead, that steam game can wait. 

The rewards will come sooner or later but it's up to you.

I think it's important to understand the aims of the course. 6.00x is a *computer science* course, as such, the point of the exercise, and the skills learnt are transferrable to other languages. To view learning Python as the *primary* goal would be a mistake, though it's certainly *a* goal.

Beyond that, as well as computer scientists just starting out.

On an apologetic note towards those who took it last semester: we know the site was‚Ä¶ buggy. And unreliable. Some of the backend is a great example of how *not* to design a system.

It would be a lie to say I had absolutely no experience

**Timeline**

Week 1 - lynda.com [objective-c course](http://www.lynda.com/Xcode-4-tutorials/Objective-C-Essential-Training/77860-2.html) completed. I originally went for the lynda iOS SDK course but in the first section it tells you to do the objective-c one. Not completely necessary if you're familiar

Week 2 - lynda.com [iOS SDK](http://www.lynda.com/iOS-tutorials/iOS-SDK-Essential-Training/92179-2.html) course completed. Great videos that come highly recommended. All done through screen capture so you can watch them code in real time

Week 3 - I took this week to brainstorm and draft a practice app. This may be a very difficult step for some and can be skipped but it helps keep you motivated to learn more. You will immediately discover something you want in your app (paged scroll views) that you dont know how to implement. So **google it** and begin learning. I can **guarantee** someone has already tried it and there is a tutorial available.

Week 4 - complete a decent, their criteria (i.e. price, graphics, ect.) and how much they care about each criteria, then an algorithm I knew would tell them which was the better product for them. PM me for source files.

Week 5 - Here is where I hit roadblock #1: Paged Scroll View. Hit up one of my developer friends and he sent me to [Ray Wenderlich's site](http://www.raywenderlich.com) which has **tons** of very helpful

Week 6 - completed [Stanford's iPhone App course](http://itunes.stanford.edu) on iTunes U. This is very informative with a good instructor but you dont get access to homework or grading so all you can do is follow along. Still worth watching.

Week 7 - completed Nick Kuh's [Foundation iPhone App Development](http://www.apress.com/9781430243748) book. This was a great read

Week 8 - if you haven't already started on a legit app, right? to make stuff we would use. So make something. In the end, the cycle of having problems, finding a suitable solution, and implementing it, is the truest way to learn.

I just finished my first app with the help of a designer friend and I'm submitting it to the app store after this post!

1. Set a goal and talk about it. You‚Äôll need the pressure.
2. I recommend Codecademy as a learning platform. CodeYear 2013 has just started. No better time to start than now.
3. Once the euphoria is over
4. Allow yourself a few weeks‚Äô break after failing for the first time.
5. Get an account at Github. Be it only as an ironic statement first.
6. Tackle your first personal project as soon as you feel comfortable enough to apply some creativity.
7. Find an experienced programmer you can ask for help when you‚Äôre stuck.
8. And then it all comes together. From there
9. Don‚Äôt fixate on the journalistic value. It will get obvious soon enough.
10. Being able to code is a USP for journalists and allows you to think beyond existing formats.

------------------


So, people who are skilled at certain technologies, languages, or whatever, and have them preside as curators over a set of projects which encourage open hacking. I've created such an organization at [github.com/LearnProgramming](http://www.github.com/LearnProgramming). I also included this in it's (presently sole) repository, detailing the idea behind the organization:

-------------------

#Overview 

LearnProgramming is an organization that grew out of the subreddit /r/learnprogramming, it seems, new programmers feel daunted by the task of contributing to open source, they don't know what to do, how to write code that meets standards, or how to really contribute in an effective way to open source projects. This organization intends to provide a playground, staffed by the best and brightest self-elected members of the /r/programming community, without fear of reproach or denial due to their beginner status.

-------------------

So, I'm interested in volunteers. Presently there are three people, I think 6 or 8 is a good number for a first iteration to flesh out the idea. I hope to set up a fairly lightweight standards to help guide how we deal with projects. In principle, the members of the organization are responsible for the overall architecture as well as the more Product Owner-y duties of determining features and such. Of course, being a member of the organization is not requisite for participating in discussions regarding how it does it's work, or what works it does (in terms of projects, etc).

I would like it if anyone self-electing themselves to potential membership write out what kind of experience they have, I'm a Ruby and Haskell developer with a strong emphasis on CS Theory and 'Architecture'; Another might be a Java developer experienced with enterprise style development; another might be a C hacker who writes kernel code; etc), the aim being to give us a broad mix of people from which to draw ideas for projects. The guiding principle always being high code quality standards (for whatever that means for the given language), clearly defined standards for patch acceptance, and -- crucially -- an emphasis on not rejecting out of hand with minimal explanation, but rather taking opportunity to use patch rejection as a teaching opportunity. Emphasizing that rejection because you need to refactor/because you lack documentation/etc is not  something to be ashamed of, but rather an opportunity to learn why it is important to have good docs, and clean code.

------------------

To clarify, it often comes in the form of 'RTFStandards Doc', rather than taking time to tell them that -- ""You need to refactor this code to use X pattern, it will make it more maintainable in the long run"". The reason they don't is understandable. Big project maintainers have better things to do then say, ""Hey, your code needs to change in ways X Y and Z because of reasons Q and R."" To that end, I hope that this organization can take some of that burden of training new programmers to contribute to open source away from the big projects. In essence, we get the learning contributor to understand how to craft a quality patch, and all of the things we -- as experienced developers -- know intuitively.

-----------------

In summary, I hope to have many projects operating concurrently, to provide a wide target for contribution. 

Please, or fantastic, or anywhere in between.

If you are interested in being a mentor in the org, I'll add this information to an AUTHORS in the standards and practices repo, so format it as if you would like it to last for perpetuity.

Also. Sorry for the wall of text. :)

A project with OSX applications
I took on the project entirely in applescript (with a few lines of bash) -- a mistake
  
On my own, I conquered problems more difficult than anything I have ever experienced.  
I figured out how to input user supplied variables into a 14.5k line XML file to edit a Motion template using sed.  
I suffered through the limitations and idiosynchrosies of applescript.  
I used sketchy workarounds.

I tend to strongly doubt my own programming ability, we had ungraded practice assignments, and the professor pointed out that I was the only person in the class that finished them all, and that I had clean code.

At my internship, making debugging logs, and looking through the source code to potentially find fixes.  I ended up fixing a minor bug that's plagued us for months, and found the cause (though not a fix) of a major bug that's been bothering us since I discovered it a couple months ago.

I've written code that can read Minecraft worlds and exports them to a ray-tracer for high-quality renders.

My supervisor asked me to write some code to extract status data from the driver we are developing and display it in a UI.  My supervisor was impressed that I pulled it off in only a few hours

And yet...I feel like I have no idea what I'm doing.  I doubt myself.

I have worked as a professional web developer and I am currently finishing up an internship at Intel as a Software Engineering Intern. Though

 I have tried to prepare, not reimplement  data structures then analyze it's BigOh complexity. That's been done millions of times.

&lt;I think what I mean here is I see little incentive to redo a problem from a book when I can look it up. I would like a more interesting approach that allows me to see the value. Or possibly an approach with feed back where creating a custom solution makes sense because people can inform me what I am doing wrong and why. I think they have a training package on Cracking the Code website but I am not willing to spend all that money for that.&gt; 

 I was wondering if anybody had a fun way to prepare for this type of interview.

Continuing from the recent success of my previous post on dungeon generation (**[Procedural Dungeon Generation Explained](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1dlwc4/procedural_dungeon_generation_algorithm_explained/)**) I decided that I will post more game development articles and videos in the future to inspire the community and also hopefully promote my game [TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com) as well!

This is the first of the multi-part series of updates about TinyKeep's AI

I've posted a detailed **[YouTube video of the Roaming and Chasing behaviour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAxfnFRB1Dg)**

In a nutshell

1 . A connected waypoint graph is calculated for a new procedurally generated dungeon. Generally we will have one waypoint per room (though some larger rooms may contain 2 or 3)

2 . By default a monster will be in non-alert (roam/patrol) mode

3 . The monster has a FOV of 90 degrees

4 . Once an enemy is detected

5 . If the enemy escapes line of sight

This is the most important part of the AI, by leaving behind the trail to follow.

6 . Trails decay over time (smells disappear), looks around for a bit, decides that he has lost the enemy and goes back to the patrol routine.

7 . All the while - a handful of rays are cast (about 6) around the monster to detect nearby walls. If it exceeds a certain distance the monster is repelled from the wall using the Separate Steering Behaviour. This pretty much guarantees that monsters won't get stuck on walls


That's pretty much it!


You can have a play yourself on the interactive demo shown on the video:

Here's what I propose:

* Top-level comments should be a single language (might be worth it to separate C# and .Net as separate topics). No commentary or book recommendations here.  
* Second level comments should be a *single* book recommendation
* Third level and below

Skill Levels:
  
* Intro: Aimed at programmers new to a particular language. Use 'Basic Intro' if it assumes you've never programmed before at all.  
* Intermediate: Assumes a familiarity with a language
* Pro: Nuts and bolts of a language. A new programmer would have no hope of getting through these books without serious struggles. Specific implementation details are discussed in depth

Here is the agreement that my new boss and I came to:

&gt; REDACTED will contract with you on a project-by-project basis for an agreed price on delivery and approval by the client. It is understood you will invoice REDACTED when the work is complete: a simple numbered and dated invoice will do.

&gt; Work undertaken for REDACTED but not directly involved in programming for a project or in getting information about the project (e.g., or seeking clarification) should be tracked and invoiced at REDACTED/hour. I have in mind client meetings, or assistance with technical matters for the company, etc. You would track those hours, when they occurred and what they were for.

&gt; You will likely also want to track the time you spend directly on projects to see how you're doing in terms of effective $/hr. I expect that as you learn and become familiar with the toolset your productivity will increase to a level much higher than REDACTED/hr. I would want that too since it means we can deliver projects more quickly. Time you spend in learning the toolset is not billable.

**He is basically taking a chance at me;** a self-taught programmer with no **real-world** (filling a clients needs) experience.

I quickly got a new major, C++ turned into computer science, visual basic, java, html, sql

My fall term ended up being a disaster.  I was working 5 days a week and had 6 classes at the same time.  I got burnt out and began to question why I was even doing any of this.  I had lost sight of learning and was trying to have the worlds greatest GPA and graduate as fast as possible.  


Then came this winter term.  I had run out of pell finacing due to my major switch, Assembly and Computer Architecture.  One of the scarier beasts in the programing world.  I walked in prepared to have it proven to me I didn't belong in coding, what really happened was instantly bliss.  I was back on the ground level , all of the layers of abstraction that were confusing the hell out of me were gone.  I was back to learning to problem solve in tandem with a machine.  Epiphanies occurred while working on each assignment.  My enthusiasm was becoming obnoxious.  I was spending 16 hr sessions fighting bit by bit trench warfare and loving it.  I was very likely spending 40+ hours a week just learning/coding assembly.  After the first month I would come to class and watch as the same classmates I felt inferior too were struggling with the problems I thought were obvious.   Yesterday, after 5 days straight of doing nothing but working on my final project (a program that makes building sprites in assembly, with assembly , fast and easy) I received what I consider the first high praise of anything I have ever coded (or done in school period) , and I still need to finish a few things

(If you are thinking about stepping forward as a mentor

---

You're a new programmer. You're a high school student; you're studying computer science at a university; you don't like your current job and you want to try something new; you've been programming for fun for a while but you want to get serious; whatever. I think a mentorship might be a good way to go about that.

I don't have a lesson plan or anything. This isn't a tutorial,"" and I'd tell you the sorts of things you need to study in order to do that, helping you along the way. Or if you just want someone to consult every now and then when you get stuck, I can do that too.

I found the hardest part of learning to program is just getting a handle on what's out there: where do you start? What's the first step towards making a website? What's a ""compiler""? There are few high-level overviews of this sort of thing

This isn't a homework helper or anything. If you just want to pass your CS classes

**Do you have any weird pedagogic opinions that will impact your mentoring style?**

I would like to try teaching multiple programming languages at the same time. That might sound a little crazy, not because it has to be that way. Strings are immutable in Python but mutable in Ruby; that's another decision.

Optimally you would have single language that you want to learn (or I would help you pick one). It can be just about anything. But along the way

I am very experienced with Python, Java, CoffeeScript, Objective-C, C, and C++. I have light experience with Ruby, Haskell, Clojure, I'm also very proficient with HTML, Cocoa Touch

**Who are you?**

I'm a long time Stack Overflow contributor who recently discovered this subreddit. I like helping people program; I don't know why. I'm about to graduate from one of the top ten computer science programs in the US. I've been programming for over ten years

I've definitely still got a lot to learn

**What do you get out of this?**

I'd like to write a book for beginning programmers. But it's been a while since I learned how to code, like ""make sure `/usr/local/bin` is in your `PATH`"" -- that's the sort of thing that an experienced *nix user would say, but would probably turn off a beginner. I want someone to call me out on that sort of thing.

I'm also designing my own programming language

**What do I do?**

Comment or message me with what you want to do (specific is better than general) and we'll go from there. Email is probably the best way to do this long term

**TL;DR** You want to learn how to program; I want to teach you.

**Edit**: Okay

If you're really serious about this, a ton of detail, but it'll be a lot easier to differentiate that sort of post than a bunch of people saying they're interested.

If this turns into something valuable I'll compile exchanged messages or something into something more useful for a larger audience

**Further edit**: I've gotten a ton of requests so far but they show no sign of slowing down. I'm going to wait until this calms down a bit before I start sorting through requests and responding to people, so apologies in advance if I say I can't help. (I've never done this before!)

Also, I can help, but if you're an experienced Java developer looking to get into the ecosystem I'm not going to be much use. Maybe there are some Android pros out there who are interested in mentoring?

**The first session was done on Monday



**SCHEDULE**

This will keep getting updated

* Monday 21 May - 8:30AM EDT to 10:30AM EDT - Day1 - .NET Platform, understanding your first application.

~~Tuesday 22 May -  8:30AM EDT to 10:30AM EDT - Day2 - Data Types/Variables

[Learn C# at Justin.tv](http://justin.tv/sanddy19)


--------------------------------------

I have been a Microsoft MVP C# for 4 years as well as I have co-authored and edited a couple of books on the MS .NET Platform. 

I have some free time in office in the coming weeks and would like to teach C# over Skype (or any other video sharing platform) to redditors for **free**! 
I have not completely planned it

Only hiccup is that I stay in Mumbai

It makes sense for me to conduct these sessions if there are at least 5 people interested. More the better. So let me know your views and if you would find this kind of training helpful. 

Disclosure: I own a software small development company [AksTech](http://akstech.com) in Mumbai as well as I write articles on my site [Master C#](http://mastercsharp.com) (older content). I am not a professional trainer
If there are any questions please do ask

**EDIT**: 
It will help me if the users who are interested could verify if the time 8:30 EDT to 10:30 EDT would work out for them as well as their level of general programming knowledge.   

I do plan to upload the recoded videos later. 

**No Need to Sign-up:** I have got enough interest expressed

**System Requirements**
Windows Vista/Windows 7/8 PC

Please install [Visual C# 2010 Express](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/en-us/products/2010-editions/visual-csharp-express) - its a free download from Microsoft. Make sure after installation you have got the product key and activated it.

I first made a carbon copy changing only the syntax. Last week I got it running with matching results. The run time in my fortran version was 14 seconds with the original code taking about 21 seconds. Hooray fortran is faster. I then made some small changes to get a runtime of 12 seconds using output from gprof. But then I noticed the output from the gnu profiler (gprof) only accounted for about 1 second of run time. So I looked it up. Apparently gprof does not track standard function calls like read and write. So I broke out the big guns. I installed valgrind (an amazing open source profiler). I used the callgrind tool and kcachegrind to make a call table that showed where my program spent all of its time. My program spent 80% of its time in a simple routine. The routine interploated a table. The reason it took so long was that I reread the table each time the routine was called. So I made it read once and store to a variable. I ran it again and the new run time was 1.6 seconds. Almost an 8x speed up. The original plan was to go parallel

EDIT: A lot of people are making good points about when to optimize. Optimization should only be done when it is worth your time. My program currently runs in 12 seconds, this is a code that will likely get passed around to other researchers and it is likely that some poor sap will later inherit this code to change and adapt for their research.

Hello everyone

Today (Sat

In this course, such as Apache. You also will typically need a server side scripting language, to handle everything that happens to your code in order to create what the end-user will see, and for that we will be using PHP. You also need a database to store your information, and for that we will be using MySQL, and so on.

In this course you will learn about how to build your own complex web applications

When you have completed this course, version control, and more. 

In the previous sessions

----

[Session #1

Major topics that were covered:

* Setting up a server (Amazon EC2
* Setting up a web server (Apache 2.0 on an Ubuntu Linux Machine)
* Configuring a development environment (GNU Screen, etc.)
* The basics of networking and IT security (firewall rules
* The basics of using a version control system (GIT)
* The basics of server side scripting (PHP)

In this session

----

[Session #2

Major topics that were covered: 

* How to use GNU Screen to save your work/session for later.
* The basics of HTML and Forms
* The basics of how to use log files
* Using .htaccess to force all URLs to go to a central ""controller""
* The basics of Model View Controller methodology.
* The basics of Regular Expressions.

In this session we explored GNU screen more

----

[Session #3

Major topics expected to be covered:

* Setting up a MySQL Server
* Creating simple PHP scripts that store data in a MySQL database
* The basics of using Sessions
* More about using GIT for version control
* Further development of the MVC itself

As with all sessions, so expect me to Google for things when I get stuck, and to perhaps spend some time troubleshooting when something doesn't work right.

Something I realized today though, things slip through the cracks.  I end up in the middle of a paragraph and forget how I got there.  

When reading dense material (as in information-ally dense), you're just making it harder for yourself.

I also realized that concepts won't sink in immediately, your eyes open to the complexities of the material and you see it much clearer.  I used to say to myself 'I shouldn't have to watch something twice, I should understand it the first time.', but that isn't true.  Programming is too complex, and it's not always going to be that way.  

It's not a race.  The goal is to learn.  If you have to read something 5 times to get it to sink in, but I thought it might be relevant to others.

Mentors are mentioned countless times all over the internet when it comes to how someone really got going in improving their skill level. People are also encouraged to talk to us about becoming a mentor! The help is greatly appreciated

**Google+ Community:**

We'll be using Google+ pretty extensively due to the fact that it has Hangouts. Hangouts are great in that we can video chat with multiple simultaneously and archive our sessions for those who may miss a session or someone who might just be visiting (also will be uploaded to YouTube). Link below.

I've been programming for nearly 1 year now, also decided to write one at the same time. I came across a problem in the midst of my work that I asked him for some help with. When he looked at my code he was astounded at how ""overly complicated"" I had made everything. He was referring to the way I had made nearly every aspect of the chess game an object. For instance, I had a Chessboard object that held subclasses of the Chesspiece object, like pawn/knight/rook/etc. His implementation, on the other hand, was more or less an array representing all the chess spaces with integer values in each index representing which piece if any was there. This seems pretty smart, and maybe much easier to me, I don't represent the car as an array with car parts as integer values; I make a car object with smaller objects composing it.

Am I thinking about OOP in the wrong way? Is my friend thinking about OOP in the wrong way? Is OOP not the end-all-be-all of programming?

Each programming language is like a specialty Lego set.  There a dinosaur sets, etc.  You can adapt them to make anything you want, but they will always excel at the task for which they were intended.  It's the specialty pieces that make this so.

I learned to program when I was 10, it was just playing with something new.  Each time I hit a road block, I would see it as a puzzle to be solved - a mystery to figure out.  Each lesson learned resulted in a new puzzle piece to add to my repertuar.

That's the thing about programming that is akin to magic for me.  Eventually, a machine shop that will cut the casting dies to make any piece you desire.  The statements of any programming language aren't limited to that which you've been given.  You can add your own special statements and make your own special purpose Lego sets that build the things you want to build.  This is why colleges try to teach you the fundamentals like C++ or Java.  These are the core sets which can make anything.

This project is my first ""big"" one. It's been a really exciting experience to write and develop, especially if it takes an audience wider than just my friends (which is not something I particularly anticipate, but oh well). Anyway, the point is: I'm invested in it, and to me the quality of this project is worth more than my feelings about this first draft, so criticise it brutally. I've already rewritten it a few times for reasons smaller than what I predict you will point out, so I'm not hesitant to start over if it means a cleaner/more stable/more modular codebase.

[Here](http://paytonturnage.github.com/Charl/) is a link to the github pages. The pages includes download links for binaries if you don't feel like configuring allegro, good and bad, so I know what I can do better, what to change and what to keep!

If you'd like to test it, you can run the server and connect clients all on your own machine (the ip would be 127.0.0.1).

A few things I'll note first though: 

* I am learning how to use make

* The code indicates mute, and a few other commands that aren't implemented yet; those are coming.

Then of course, I fall into this category. Initially, Group A blows us out of the water because they've had more experience writing really trivial programs. But after a few semesters, IF Group B works insanely hard, the skill level between the two groups seems to level off.

I started to wonder if the people who started early really have a significant advantage in programming over those who started in college. On one hand, how complicated are these games honestly? At a young age its probably easy to develop bad habits and have them persist throughout the years. I think a college aged student would have an easier time wrapping his/her mind around abstract concepts and learning good practices from professional instructors.

Just as an example. My current Data Structures class consists of Groups A and B

#My Learn to Program Manifesto

My view of learning to program is that you can't learn everything from
one source
subject matter. Some sources favor a Project-first approach and some
favor a Fundamentals-first approach is lots of small exercises. I
personally favor the later.

So my suggestion is to start slow and view learning Ruby on Rails as a
journey
Course](http://www.learnstreet.com/lessons/study/ruby) by Learn
Street
just teaches you about a concept then gives you an exercise to try it
out with. To help cement this knowledge I suggest you read the online
book [Learn to Program](http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/) by Chris Pine.
It's written for those brand new to program and very chapter has
exercises with it. I suggest you work on those exercises in [Ruby
Fiddle](http://rubyfiddle.com/). After you finish the book and the
Learn Street course
Complete 3 beginner projects

Having a solid grasp of Ruby now it's time to fill in any gaps in your
knowledge around some of the intermeidate concepts. I'd suggest you
check out the intermediate course called [Ruby
Bits](http://www.codeschool.com/courses/ruby-bits) by Code School. The
reason I'm recommending Code School's course here over Treehouse's
[Ruby Foundations](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/ruby-foundations)
is because there are Code Challenges after the videos in *Ruby Bits*
in *Ruby Foundations* there are only quizzes. As I'm sure you probably
learned with CSS
solve problems.

Quizzes do little to cement understanding. Programming languages like
natural languages tend to be **use it or lose it**. So you tend to
forget the syntax you haven't used recently to solve a problem. Now
you can offset this issue by taking notes on the syntax during the
videos and then creating out your own exercises to solve and doing
them in [Ruby Fiddle](http://rubyfiddle.com).

Now that you are pretty solid with Ruby it's time to get an
introduction to Ruby on Rails. Rails has a lot of moving parts so
first a guided tour of all of these moving parts is in order
what [One Month Rails](http://onemonthrails.com/) is for. It won't
teach you to build a whole Rails app in a month (despite marketing
hype to the contray) however it will provide you something essential
an understanding on how these parts fit together. The goal here is to
get high level overview on how stuff fits together so you can spend
more time worrying about the actual Ruby on Rails when you get there
than worrying about tools that are merely a means to end. About the
time you finish *One Month Rails* you probably won't get learn about
Twitter Bootstrap.

You've probably already built a your site from scratch using HTML &amp;
CSS and learned all about nerding out on Typography as well as other
important design concepts. If you don't know about all of those things
well there's a [Learning
Adventure](http://teamtreehouse.com/learning-adventures/learn-html-and-css)
for that. So since you've got all of that down
you are learning Rails you should be doing just that **focusing on
Rails** no trying to decide at which weight your body typeface looks
best. So my modest proposal is that when building a Rails app for
learning purposes don't worry about design.

The easiest way to not worry about design is to use Twitter Bootstrap
which happens to be the very same framework that is used the *Build a
Basic Ruby on Rails* course. So work through the [Twitter Bootstrap
101](http://webdesign.tutsplus.com/series/twitter-bootstrap-101/)
tutorial by tutsplus to get up to speed on Twitter Bootstrap. Build
yourself a site with Twitter bootstrap and now would be a good time to
learn about changing bootstrap's default stylings. Practice
customizing everything so it looks like it was coded from scratch and
put that knowledge in your back pocket for after you make your first
Ruby on Rails app from scratch you will no doubt want to but your web
design skills to use then.

So now that you've gone through all of that
put everything you've learned together into a functioning app with the
[Build a Simple Ruby on
Rails](http://teamtreehouse.com/library/programming/build-a-simple-ruby-on-rails-application)
Application.

#### **User Flair**:  
There was a lot of discourse and questions about whether we should implement user flair, we've decided that we're going to allow users to edit their own flair, and flair will be used to display your **points of interest**.  This is in no way a statement of qualification, and if it is used as such, it will be removed.  
  

The point of flair on LearnProgramming is to provide a convenient way for like-minded community members to find eachother.  This will (hopefully) give members an easy way to find open source projects, and resources.  User Flair will be implemented in the near future once an appropriate style/template has been figured out.

[Original post](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/xwd16/had_a_technical_phone_interview_today_for_an/)

Here's how the final in house interview went:

When I first arrived I met up with the hiring manager for the software engineers

They asked a lot about the projects I listed in my resume and put on github

After lunch

Given two arbitrarily sized linked lists

For example:

List 1: [1]-&gt;[2]-&gt;[3]

List 2: ........[5]-&gt;[6] (right justified)

Output list:  [1]-&gt;[7]-&gt;[9]

Rather than giving me a linked list class

    public node sumRightJustified(node firstList

I'll leave you guys to solve it.  It's not terribly difficult.  I was allowed to write other functions too.  I wrote a simple constructor in the node class and a function that finds lengths of lists to help me out.

Writing code on a white board in front of employers is pretty nerve racking

After the whiteboard part they asked me some more general questions.  Here they are paraphrased to the best of my memory (recall this job uses Java):

1) Give us your methodology for commenting code and tell us about how you can write readable and maintainable code.
-Obviously fairly open ended.  I talked about the importance of good variable names

2) What's the difference between an interface class and an abstract class and why would you use one over the other -I'm a C++ guy so I'm not sure I got this one right

3) Say you have a giant block of code that sort of works
-For this one I said depending on just how buggy and poorly commented it was, that block of code might haunt them as new engineers come in and need to maintain the code base.  I said it would be a good time investment to clean up the code for that reason.

4) They asked about experience in SQL and multithreading

After that portion of the interview

They sat me in a room with a laptop (WITH internet access

I was given a half hour to read over the code, so pretty slow) and asked why I thought it was running so slow.  I figured out pretty quickly how things were working and why it was bottlenecking so I described to him the problem.  After that I was given over an hour to figure out a solution and implement it in the actual code.  When I was done he said I had found the optimal solution, which was great.  It's probably also important to note that I was careful to write clean and well-commented code.

###CodeCademy Feedback

For those who don't want to read all the comments here is a summary of the feedback so far:

## Positive
 
* Q&amp;A forum: helpful when you get stuck; good to see how others solved problems; encourages a community culture; helps you learn to work with others
* Gamification: Badges are very motivating; easy to share to Twitter and Facebook
* HTML/CSS courses: enjoyable
* Good coverage of introductory topics: variables, arrays, functions, objects, recursion etc.
* NON-BEGINNERS: Great review and practice for those who have some programming background

## Neutral

* Lesson quality: some are ""great""
* Lesson topics: some are ""interesting""
* Lesson examples: some give good examples that show the usefulness of code; more of these types of examples are needed

## Negative

* Different authors: courses are have varied and inconsistent teaching styles; courses repeat material from previous courses; seem to assume knowledge of concepts not yet introduced
* Lesson descriptions: are necessarily long; the important information is not always in the bold section; are often poorly worded; contain technical terminology not introduced in previous lessons
* Code checking and feedback: some courses are buggy and have been so for months; many lessons will pass your code even when it is incorrect
* Course design: lessons tell you the what (code syntax); but many don't teach the how and why very well; learners get to the end and feel as though they didn't learn much
* Course pace: lessons progress too fast for the average beginner
* UI: Minor complaints about unhelpful error messages in the code editor

A little background on me:
  I'm a 28 year old programmer that is a web developer professionally.
  I know a lot of languages, from low-level assembly to high level scripting / dynamic languages.
  I've professionally worked the industry for about 6 years now.
  I did not graduate college; I began learning to program at around 8 years old. By the time I was an adult
  I have spent a large amount of time (around 10, philosophy, basic statistics, and logic in this pursuit. Additionally, I've read every white paper I could get my hands on, even those going back to the 70's.

In this time

This comes up often because people ask me how to get into the profession or the hobby

So

1) If you do not enjoy learning, get out now. This is a profession/hobby that lends itself to a lifetime of homework. Furthermore, it is a world that exists in idea, and is not tangible: if you do not have the motivation to sit and think about it, you will not be able to understand it. If you can do anything else and be happy, I suggest you go do that.

2) Speaking of the world of intangible ideas: Despite what you may thing, and they are essentially your bitch. You are the user. You are the one that uses. Do not get used by the computer; if it does not do what you want it to do, what you want it to do is either impossible, or you are approaching it wrong.

3) You, Stallman, Dijkstra, etc; we're all effectively idiots. Do not ever get into the habit of thinking you truly know everything about anything. You only know what you know, and you do not know the things you do not know are out there to know. Information is doubling every 2 years, at least, do not think for a second you have all of it. There is an effectively infinite array of programmy 'things' to learn and do; keep an open mind and always seek novel ideas.

4) That said

5) This one is important, behavior driven programing, functional programing, graph structure, relational structure, structured programming, etc, etc are ideas and paradigms. They are not the solution to everything, but it just might help (alot).

6) Just as important: XML, etc are just documentation languages: ways of containing and presenting data. Avoid putting logic inside your data. It is unavoidable or even useful for somethings to do so, but those are a tiny minority.

7) There are exceptions to everything.

8) Your code today is somebody else's code in half a year. Be kind to yourself and comment.

9) The community of programmers is a wonderful place with excellent people and awesome dialog. There are a lot of assholes (myself included). Just ignore them.

10) Teach somebody else how to program. It will put what you do in a new light.

11) You need to know C

12) There are no bad languages. There are a surprising amount of bad programmers.

13) Stop hating on Microsoft. They are a horrible business and evil and whatever else

14) If, then it's time to dust of the resume and find a new job. Do not get stuck in a rut.

15) Do not work more than 50 hours a week. It is very easy to do so. Do not drink too much caffeine. Eat correctly. Get up at least once an hour.

16) A large portion of programming happens in your head. If you are stumped

17) Learn to talk to non-technical people about technical things. Half your profession will be spent doing so.

18) Try not to play more than one video game at a time. Avoid MMORPGs. Video games are wonderful

19) Always be making something for yourself. Have a personal project.

20) Concurrency is the future.

I've been interested in programming for a long time, the further I've progressed down my chosen path of study, the more I realize that knowing how to do stuff in a specific language is nowhere near as important as knowing how to be a good programmer. I *really* want to be a good programmer. Unfortunately, I suffer from a crippling lack of ambition (I play too many vidya), and a woeful inability to not look at what I have to learn in small sections. I recently started a development internship and have been given a ""reading list"" from the guy who seems to have taken the responsibility of mentoring me. I'm reading up on the stuff he's mentioned, and it's interesting, but I feel like a lot of it isn't really sinking in, which causes me to shrink away and go back to other

Anyways, such that I can learn how to be good at what I do, as opposed to just know a lot of languages and be bad at all of them? I know that the key is practice, practice, practice - I'm just afraid that I don't have enough knowledge yet, and that I'd only be reinforcing bad habits.

All techniques demonstrated are implemented in my game **[TinyKeep](http://tinykeep.com)**


Interactive demos for Parts 1

http://tinykeep.com/ai


**Part 1 Improvements**

Before I crack on with Part 2

[Part 1.1 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/YttkpNdS5bY)

In short

1 . The co-ordinate of the last detected entity (either player character or breadcrumb) is saved as a variable every frame. So, he will still continue to head towards this last detected location as its final target and re-evaluate from there. This is an improvement from the previous version where a monster would stop and go back to patrolling even though it has detected a target in the past - which is not expected behaviour.

2 . If the Skeleton still cannot detect anything from this point (all raycasts to the player and breadcrumbs again return false), the best guess waypoint remains the same. I admit it's a little bit cheaty of the AI - since it now knows exactly where the character is in order to set the waypoint - but it works well and looks realistic enough because of its slow movement during non-alert patrol mode. Most players won't know the difference, it just looks like the the monster is heading in the general direction and its likely the player has moved on from this point anyway. Still - for completeness I may modify best guess to take into account the target's last seen velocity and extrapolate from there.

Given these changes, lest we give the impression that the AI is cheating all of the time! This also gives the player the opportunity to hide behind corners and ambush monsters walking past.

Let's move on to the fun stuff!


**TinyKeep AI System (Part 2 of 5) : Retreating and Defense**

Today we'll be following a little Fire Imp as we discuss Retreating and Defensive behaviours. Fire Imps (and other monsters marked with the ""Shy"" personality flag) will run away from the player if he gets too close. Put him in this level of distress for too long

[Part 2 YouTube Demo](http://youtu.be/dIBuIELYd4c)

1 . For the demo

2 . Like the Skeletons, Alert mode is turned on and the Fire Imp faces the target. It will continue to face the target while in Alert mode, as long as it can still see and smell the target. At this point the Fire Imp will not flee just yet - the target is not close enough to be a major threat, but it is alerted and wary, and constantly tracking you with its sight.

3 . While in Alert mode, rather than the other way around). The resultant vector is normalized and scaled to the Fire Imp's max speed, so now the monster is repelled away from the player if it gets too close.

4 . Unlike the Seek Behaviour, another monster etc.. We don't get this problem with Seeking, because the target is always the player, who is always in the an empty space. To prevent problems with getting stuck - we must increase the wall avoidance distance. The Fire Imp now follows the corridors and rooms rather getting stuck on them. This is also useful for when the Imp is stuck in a corner - it will slide nicely away if the player tries to advance further.

5 . Each monster has it's own type of defensive behaviours while retreating. For this demo, a cooldown period is activated before it breathes fire again.

And that's it! Quite simple reactive behaviour but effective. I did try to use some kind of pathfinding to accomplish fleeing but the results were buggy and there was a lot more consideration required to make it look realistic. In the end the reactive technique using Fleeing Steering Behaviour returned better results. The key takeaway with game AI is that a combination of simpler rules often work better than a monolithic and complicated top-down system. Also - exaggerate your behaviours! Make them look around often, if the player isn't given cues as to what is going on under the hood - the monsters will not SEEM intelligent.

I've done some searching and I've stumbled upon these few promising APIs.

* [MyMovie](http://mymovieapi.com/)

This seems good

&gt; The TV series's episodes(only TV series). Fields: date season episode title.

I can only manage to get the season + episode number of an episode, but not 3. even though I confirmed on the website the titles are shown there.

* [TheTVDB](http://www.thetvdb.com/wiki/index.php?title=Programmers_API)

Looks very promising

* [TVDB API \(C#\)](https://code.google.com/p/tvdb-api/)

This is a API DLL written in C# that is supposed to take away some of the work. It's 5 years old though



**How to start?**

The main problem I'm facing is that I don't know how to start. I've never used an API before

One of the things I've noticed is that there is no such option as 'retrieve all tv-series'

I'm building a C# ASP.NET MVC 4 application
If needed I could also look into writing it in another language

      Your experience may vary.

* **Relax!**

 * The people you will work with know you are fresh out of school. The environment I worked in was extremely low-pressure. I was able to set my own deadlines for the project I was working on.  I didn't have to handle tickets

* **Network!**

 * Get to know people around the company.  When your name comes up during the review

* **""Think outside the box""**

 * Consider this: The problem you're solving may already be solved. The best software developer is one that doesn't have to write any code to solve a problem ... or one that can solve the problem with one line of code.  

 * An intern I worked with was given a project and 3 months to complete it.  He searched for a full day through documentation and found a tool which already solves the problem.  In essence

* **Don't be afraid to ask questions when you get stuck**

 * By ""stuck""

* **Check in with your boss/mentor at least once a week**

 * This helped me immensely.  My boss/mentor would tell me how I'm doing (positive feedback) and also how I could improve (constructive criticism). This is much better than hearing ways you could improve *after* you've completed the internship.

* **Be honest**

 * I didn't expect this to come up, avoid headaches, and admitting your own faults and shortcomings shows integrity.

 * I [accidentally] submitted code to the repository that was not peer-reviewed (which is against the company policy).  No one noticed but I was worried about getting caught, and helped recover the situation.  Other companies may not be so forgiving, so be sure that if *you* don't know what you're doing, *someone* does, and *fast*.

I know I left some things out but these points stood out the most to me.

*For those who have found this topic via search

Now

As I'm growing more and more able to solve problems recursively, and should be.  Is this way of thinking outdated?  Is there a rule that recursive structures are inherently more resource intensive under such and such a circumstance?  When is it acceptable to choose a recursive problem solving structure?

I'll compile a list of pro's and cons below and try to update them as they are mentioned.  The list is currently just my opinion.

**Recursion**

**CONS**

* each loop adds a frame to the stack  &lt;---but when does this become a problem?
* trickier to conceptualize
* difficult to read for the non-recursively inclined.

**PROS**

* simple
* fewer lines of code
* can often be just as resource consumptive as a non recursive approach
* once conceptualized
* easy to read for the recursively inclined.



Edit:

Okay

* **1. Recursion arguably increases the possibility of a crash.**

I'm not entirely sure whether it is meant that recursion is intrinsically less stable, what are the most important trappings to keep in mind when programming recursively -- where does it usually all go wrong?

Furthermore, is it any more dangerous than, say, using pointers or other ""dangerous"" techniques?

* **2. There are no definitive rules for when to and when not to use recursion.  There are some times when recursion is necessary

As it has been pointed out, now that I've been exposed to it so much.  Where does one go about acquiring this intuition that experienced programmers have concerning recursion?  I mean, I realize I can't go pick some up from Staples, but are there certain ""case studies"" I can examine, or do I just have to wait until I ruin a program from mishandling recursion to get on the level?

2. Click a save button in this program to save the file as a text document.  I must manually enter the name of the file and browse to the path I want to save.
3. Next I open the file with MS Word to format it nicer (The file is saved as one long text file with no carriage returns
4.  Re-save the file in MS Word.
5.  Then repeat...  

All of this get very old and I feel like there must be an easier way to do this.  I'm willing to learn but not sure where to start.

This is just one simplified example.  There are other things like this that also get very repetitive but I figured I could start here.

I've been given the opportunity to do a bunch of Microsoft Certifications for free and I've got to decide which ones I want to do. 
I've done a bunch of research and read around a bit but I'm still unsure of a couple of things. The person paying for these exams is setting up a 'technology solutions' sort of company. So he'll have a few people with different skillsets covering all areas. I assume it will be web development

What exactly is ASP.NET? Is it the same as .NET? 

The web applications certification uses ASP.NET

What exactly is Azure? How is it used?


Long term goal is to get into serious software development and create applications that people use in their everyday lives but I'm thinking that it might be best to follow through with the web development route through to the end before I dive into C#?

https://gist.github.com/4059839

**Syntax Highlighting**

This can be turned on with the command:

    :syntax on

Vim comes packaged with syntax highlighters for most programming languages. Look at how pretty C++ can look:

http://imgur.com/cQPlB

In this image I am using a few things to get this effect:

* http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/256_colors_in_vim (enabling 256 colors in your terminal and vim)
* http://robotsrule.us/vim/ (extra information if you are using screen)
* http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id*3797 (Syntax highlighter for cpp 11 (default works fine as well if you aren't using cpp11 stuff))
* http://stackoverflow.com/questions/736701/class-function-names-highlighting-in-vim (make the functions and scope highlight)

my .vimrc stuff related to this:

    syntax on
    set background=dark
    set t_Co=256
    colo desert256
    au BufNewFile

ViM comes with syntax highlighters for basically all programming languages (and if it doesn't come with the language you are using

**Source Tree Navigation**

One of the best things about ViM is its ability to jump around large code bases with out
requiring the user to touch a mouse. Here some of the tricks I have:

**ctags**

ctags are a special file that index your code and allows you to jump from file to file based
on the name of a function and its parameters.

eg: Say you have 50 files in your project. File myThing.cpp contains the implementation of some function:

    void myThing::do_stuff(int arg){ ... }

else where in code you might have something that looks like:

    myThing thing; //create a new ""myThing""
    thing.do_stuff(42); //call do stuff

For the life of you
implementation.

With ctags you can move your cursor over the ""do_stuff"" method call and press 

    ctrl+]

and like magic
read the method

    ctrl+t

Alternatively you could type:

    :tselect do_stuff
    or
    :ts do_stuff

and ViM will list all known ""do_stuff"" functions in a list
jump to.

to create a tag file

http://linux.byexamples.com/archives/177/vim-with-ctags/ (creating tags)

**split screen**

Another handy feature when moving around code is to simply have a split screen within vim so
you can look at one thing

You can achieve this by using the commands:

    :vsplit filename "" vertical split
    :split filename  "" horizontal split

to move between windows you can use:

    ctrl + w  followed by up, or right ( or h j k l ), or w to toggle

to change the file in a window

    :e filename

**file system integration**

Don't know the file name you want to open? or the directory.. no problem.. open a file system
explorer:

    :e .

This opens the current directory in a file browser you can navigate with the arrows and enter:

http://i.imgur.com/qcw4F.png

I will often split my screen into a file explorer, edit

**Editing tabs**

ViM has things called markers. I don't really use them. Instead I suggest you try a program
called screen.

This tutorial seems short and simple

http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/a-quick-tutorial-on-screen/


**Code navigation

ViM is amazing at general editing of code and has a lot of tricks which can speed things up

**First and foremost

To jump to a line number

    :42

That will jump to line 42 (surprising how many people don't know this)

To move to the start of a line and end:

    ^    "" start of line (first non blank character)
    $    "" end of the line

move forward to the letter:

    fz   "" move to the next z on the line

This is very handy to get used to

    gg   "" move to the start of the file
    G    "" move to the end of the file

There are many more

**Copy and pasting**

so you can copy and paste like a normal text editor quite easily.

    yy  "" yank the current line
    dd  "" cut the current line
    d$  "" cut to the end of the line from the cursor
    p   "" paste what is in the clip board


Often you don't want to yank/cut a single line
cut a chunk:

    shift + v   Start visual highlighting line wise (select full lines) (capital V)
    use the arrows to select the chunk I want to copy/cut
    press y or d to copy or cut

    navigate elsewhere

This makes it similar to how people usually do it a graphical editor. But.. no touching the mouse!

http://imgur.com/iaVRb (here is what it looks like)

You can also do amazing things with visual blocks (not visual lines). I might explain in comments. someone remind me.

**Regular expressions find and replace**

Once you understand how to use regular expressions you can make very expressive single line
modifications

Here are some ViM specific tips:

    :s/foo/bar    ""  Switches the first instance of foo to bar on the line your cursor is on
    :s/foo/bar/g  ""  Switches ALL instances of foo to bar on the line your cursor is on
    :%s/foo/bar/g ""  Switches ALL instances of foo to bar in the whole file

I often use it in tandum with visual select

    shift + v and select some chunk of code

when you type : it will say -

    :'&lt;

This means ""for the range I've selected"" and then you can type:

    :'&lt;
    :'&lt;
    :'&lt;, put a comma at the end of the line
    :'&lt;

I could keep going

**Searching**

I have discussed how to search within your code base with :tselect but often you just want to
find something within the current file

ViM uses regular expression searches (as described above) there are a few ways you can use it

    /foo    "" search for foo
    ?foo    "" search for foo

after you have started searching you can press:

    n   "" next result
    N   "" previous result

you can search for the word under the cursor:

    navigate to a word with the cursor
    press * (shift + 8)

I have vim configured to jump to the search phrase as I type it (very handy). You can turn
this on with the following .vimrc command

    set incsearch

**Code completion**

Everyone loves intellisense in Visual Studio.. Not many people bother trying to set it up for ViM. (I must admit
I often don't bother) but.. You can

http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/C%2B%2B_code_completion

It can be set up for any language you can generate ctags for (basically all languages)

To use it

    ctrl + n

You will get a drop down list of all possible ""valid"" things you can type. It will also search the current file
you are editing for matching keywords (this is how I often use this feature)

Here is what it looks like:

http://vissale.neang.free.fr/Vim/OmniCppComplete/ScreenShots/screenshots.htm

Here is how I use it:

http://imgur.com/JFWOn


**Interaction with other coding products**

ViM plays pretty well with other programs

**Building**

To build a simple program I often type:

    :!g++ -O3 %
    :!./a.out

This will build the program (with optimisation) and then run the a.out binary. The bang (!) denotes ""run this in a shell please""

ViM also has a nice integration with makefiles

    :make makerule
    eg
    :make hello
    this will compile hello.*** with the appropriate compiler (the make program will decide)

Using this

You can also suspend ViM

    ctrl + z
    do your stuff now
    fg

**getting the output of another program**

Sometimes I want to grab the output of another program and throw it into something I am editing.
You can do that with:

    :.!ls -la

Dump the output of ""ls -la"" into the text I am editing now

I'd like to get some reviews of the book on Amazon

**Just PM your mailing address (and email address if that's more convenient than your Reddit account for communication) if you want a copy. I'll try to respond to everyone (whether I can get you a book or not). I'll probably send out two or three reminder emails over the 30 days

The book is about 360 pages, and features the source code for 7 games (clones of Tetris, Nibbles, Sokoban, etc.) and explains how the code works. (There's also the source only for four additional games.)

Important: You need to have an account on Amazon that you've made a purchase with in order to write reviews. (This is their basic anti-spam policy.)

I'm paying for these copies out of pocket, you don't have to return the book. Maybe you can hand it over to someone else who could read it and do a review.

If you'd like to review the book anyway

Here's some things you can talk about in your review:

What's your level of coding experience? (Beginner? Professional? etc.)
Do you feel like the book helped you learn the Pygame library?

Do you feel like you know how to program games better after reading this book?

Was the book enjoyable to read

How old are you? (Teenager, etc.) Do you think other people your age would be able to follow the book?

------------------------

[LPMC on Github](http://github.com/LearnProgramming)

## Why we Mentor

Recently (okay
dedicated to providing free
contributors to work on in an environment conducive to learning
more usual environment of comfortable (usually polite) hostility that is seen in
so many major FLOSS projects.

In particular
rejected pull request and use it as a teaching opportunity
individuals interested in OSS contribution on _how to contribute effectively_.

To those experienced among us
idiomatic
contributor -- full of vim (or emacs) and vigor to contribute -- they may not
know better
unfortunate in it's content.

The idea of LPMC is similar
focus is not on the projects
aims to take maintainence of open source projects which are being EOLed (like
Wave)
of a new home. LPMC aims to help nuture and grow effective FLOSS contributors
to the benefit of the whole community.

## Why I'm posting

To that end
which should hopefully motivate us toward our aforementioned goals.

First of all
Benevolent Dictator. This is to facilitate rapidly forming all of the structure
needed to build out the community of mentors, irc channels,
mailing lists
I'm in charge[1] as the ""Dictatus Benedictus Perpetuum"" (because if you can't
say it in dog latin

Secondly, very
many of you) who posted in response to my previous post with your interest in
being a mentor
time amidst my other responsibilities. However
and rounding out the mentoring team soon.

Thirdly
on for those projects). In particular
on the Cinch framework. Because of Cinch's plugin architecture
to write isolated code which will work with Percy without issue. There is also
opportunity for building a better testing apparatus for Percy. Right now there
is a very simple mock IRC channel which he interacts with to exercise some of
the plugin functionality

Fourthly
the creation process than Percy[2]
phase. I'm working on a minimum viable feature list
(designers especially) to look at the site's sole issue on github to get an idea
of where I'm going

Fifthly
at #lpmc. I'm in there most of the time
LPMC IRC bot) will be (though thats a feature that needs to be implemented).

Finally
based in C++. One is an idea for a generic
when provided an interface to your coordinate system and some other information
-- will provide a fast pathfinding algorithm with minimal fuss.

He will also be adding a project to port [galib](http://lancet.mit.edu/ga) to C++11.

As we add more mentors
languages, more styles of programming. If you'd
like to participate (and you haven't already posted on the previous post) please
feel free to PM me with your name, and a description of your
experience. While there is no strict requirement of professional or
non-professional experience
is better
in this subreddit and elsewhere are also important. If I don't respond to you
don't take it to mean you are not welcome to contribute (and even mentor)
unofficially on any of the LPMC projects. Official mentor status will
come through community merit _most of the time_.

## TL;DR

LPMC is live! There are some tickets on Percival and the site already. Shortly
there will be some C++ projects up there. I'll be messaging more of you to drum
up some more projects and mentors. 

I'll be adding more tickets to the existing projects as they come up. So -- get

I took an intro programming class a long time ago and loved it, just a hobby, or maybe an iPad app or something if stuff works out.

I'm wondering what language to focus on. The class I took was based in Java

I'm a comp-sci student
All the projects I've done have been for school

In C, dice games, a small shell, a small webserver etc. 
I've never done anything with a graphical user interface in C and I have no idea where I'd even start or what to look for.

The latest project I did in java was a game using swing (a tower defence game). It was lots of fun and I really want to make more non-text based programs.

I'm not too fond of java though. I love C and I want to learn C++ so I thought I might be able to combine learning to use C++ into this little project of mine.

I'm not saying I want to create Call of duty here. What I would be happy with right now is having a window
with a circle in (a character) that moves up, obviously. But slowly.

What I'm looking for is: What do I need? My genius roomate mumbled something about a renderer when I asked him but I have no idea what that means. 
What do I search for? Are there any basic tutorials for these things? GUI's and c++? Eventually I'd like my game to use 3D



**Edit: SFML seems to be the most popular suggestion so I'm going to start looking into beginner tutorials on that. I've ordered a new C++ book (Accelerated C++ by suggestion). I also got curious about Qt for user interfaces so I will probably be researching that as well.**

A fella approached me and stated that he needed someone to redesign and reimplement his entire website.  It includes login forms and customer information where they can view their invoices, so on and so forth.

I told him that I could code.  I didn't think about anything else.  I started laying out the relationships between data tables, invoices, balances, and inventories would be calculated and stored.

I didn't think about the fact that I've never touched HTML, or CSS.  I've never had to deal with the configuration of a web server, LDAP server, or POP3 server.

When I hunkered down, it isn't difficult if you are good at rote memorization. 

I sucked.  I sucked so hard.  The website turned into shit.  I don't understand what colors looked good together, or why my goddamn &lt;p&gt; is just *a liiiiittle bit* off center.  My images looked like crap because I can't edit worth a damn (and I don't have the patience).  Nothing was turning out right.  The guy ended up thinking I was a joke and was lying the entire time to try and make a buck.  I'll see if he'll let me create a desktop application that can generate reports...

Don't make assumptions about things that you hear are easy.  I never took the time to really sit down and understand it because I thought when the time came that I did need it

A little over a year ago, and web-hosting. First I wanted to build a website to show the locations of all the DC-area foodtrucks by mining their locations out of Twitter. After a few weeks I abandoned the project because I found a couple of other sites that did the same, though they did it poorly IMO and because I found the natural language parsing rather difficult.

Then I thought about making a map of all the Capital Bikeshare locations along with some data analysis on station and system usage

The site uses a few snazzy plug-ins like [flot](http://code.google.com/p/flot/), and [sorttable](http://www.kryogenix.org/code/browser/sorttable/).

Fast forward a few months and I realize the company that runs the system was actually using my site along with another to assist their re-balancing vans!

It might be worth mentioning that I was employed during this time, I got a CS degree in college 7 years ago, so I knew java, database theory, software design, etc. I just had to learn PHP, databases in practice, etc. Also

This is my first 'big' coding project I've completed. I've been dabbling in coding for the past two years, so I'll take this opportunity to share my experiences in the hope of helping other beginners.

* Start simple. It took me 2 months of sporadic coding to complete this project, keeping track of image location, and how to detect collisions. Most importantly, it gives you an early confidence boost that you'll need to deal with the more complex challenges.

* Really think about the system you are trying to code and don't be afraid to start from scratch. DO NOT try to shoehorn in solutions just because you are married to your code. The version I posted is my fourth rewrite. I hit a wall with the previous three, I kept thinking about why it did not work and realized I can make it work better if I rewrite the program. The best feeling was writing the final fourth version, where I would still come across unexpected problems (bad), but my code was clean enough for me to write simple solutions (good) that did not feel like bad code.

* As an example for the above lesson, as each card had to have it's own behaviour depending on it's location, my code soon became a mess. I threw a tantrum and stopped coding. However, it soon dawned on me that the basic currency of Solitaire wasn't the card, but it was the pile the card was in. Suddenly, I went from 52 giant and convoluted objects to 3 different types of piles. The pile takes a card and keeps track of all the logic. In hindsight this was the obvious solution to the problem, but I did not think ahead.

______________________________________

Hey guys


I've created a website (forum) for it and I'll keep it up to date and whatnot in the next couple days.  We will not be starting the ""class"" for a few days

I'll post the link to the forum

Here is the link to the forum: [mcbadass.com/forum](http://mcbadass.com/forum) and the [post in question](http://mcbadass.com/forum/topic/python-learning-class) and here's the info:

Here is what I'm thinking and please leave some feedback.

* We will agree on a free source of classes. I've been pointed to [here](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html) and this looks like an excellent place to start. It may not cover everything we want but since it's totally free and includes video
* We will pick a ""schedule"" that works for the majority. This is always going to be tough because of everyone's different schedules. I would love some feedback on the way to do this. As of now
* I will post the lesson for the cycle on my website as well as one of the learning Reddit forums (unless that ticks people off) and it will include all the links for the lesson that cycle. We can discuss it here on this forum (if this forum sucks

* Server = Freenode 

* Channel = #McPy 

That should do it!

Let's see if we can make this work! I'll take it upon myself to keep things going and keep us all motivated. I am self employed with time on my hands and I would love to get some programming knowledge down!

I have a small amount of knowledge now and totally understand the basics but it'll take some work to get proficient. I hope we can make this happen and that enough people will be interested in something like this.

Let me know what you guys think!

Allow me to draw a comparison between linguistic syntax and programming syntax. You have variables (nouns) and functions (verbs).  Using those two things you can do a lot.

Functions do things to variables

    verb(noun)

Most of the time this makes something new as a result:

    new_noun = verb(noun)

Then you get classes, so even the most lowly noun/variable can verb/perform actions.

Now that you have these two things down

    for item in collection_of_things:
         noun = verb(item)

Computers are also great at logic.  The trick about logic is that you have to break the problem down to simple yes or no questions that the computer can answer. This is because the way that the computer answers questions is by doing math.

    if noun == other_noun:
        other_noun = verb(noun)
    else:
        noun = other_noun

There‚Äôs shorthand to make typing all this information into the computer easier, namely, and, or and but (except but is called not or !) Everything else.... is just building on those ideas or combinations of those ideas and technique, just like English or any other language.

You take packages of proper nouns called libraries and do cool things with them. In the example below

    import requests
    website_page = requests.get(url)

Boom, videos etc. and using them you are only limited by your imagination.

Now why should you invest the time to do this?  Well

In 2008 I was making $9.50 an hour as a temp customer service representative.  9 months after I taught myself Python I made 2-3x that

This would all be fine and dandy if the professors did not insist on using Visual Studio 2005 for the projects and NET framework 2.0.

I can't talk the professors into using VS2010 or 2012 since then they would be ""out of their comfort zone"" or something and I do not wish to resort to piracy to procure VS2005.

Edit: I was able to build sin. The rest is just a matter of time now.

Edit again: cos is done

Here's the trick:

  


    **! = factorial            ie
                                        4! = 4x3x2x1 = 24 
                                        5!  =  5x4x3x2x1  =  120
                                        6!  =  6x5x4x3x2x1 = 720**

**--------And this is the equation--------**

**sin = a - (a ** 3)/3! + (a ** 5)/5! - (a ** 7)/q7! +** 



**Note**: if you want to do this without using higher-order symbols

    def fact(x):
    a = x
    b = 0
    c = a * (b + 1)
    d = 1
    while d &lt;= 20:
        c = c * (b + 1)
        b += 1
        d += 1
        if d == a:
            return c

**And**: You will be entering a -DEGREE-
  
    deg = input('Enter the degrees: ')          # rads = degrees x (pi/180)
    a = deg x (3.1415 / 180)
    rad1 = a

Then write it out like this:

    sin = a - (a ** 3)/fact(3) + (a ** 5)/fact(5) - (a ** 7)/fact(7) 
    print sin

And lastly:
- TWO IMPORTANT POINTS
1) Make sure you see that the signs in

    **sin = a - (a ** 3)/3! + (a ** 5)/5! - (a ** 7)/q7!** 

are alternating

2) The more chucks of numbers (what do you call those)
    
    (a ** 5)/5!         #these

The more precise your equation will be!


Here is the entire program :D :

    def fact(x):
    a = x
    b = 0
    c = a * (b + 1)
    d = 1
    while d &lt;= 20:
        c = c * (b + 1)
        b += 1
        d += 1
        if d == a:
            return c

    def fn():
    deg = input('Enter the degrees: ')
    a = deg * (3.1415 / 180)
    rad1 = a
    sin1 = rad1 - (rad1**3) / fact(3) + (rad1**5) / fact(5) - (rad1**7) / fact(7)
    print 'The sin of', sin1

1344176389.0,xpqo2,Let's talk about programming paradigms.,JamesVagabond,102,21,45,"So

* Imperative
* Object-oriented
* Functional
* I'm pretty sure there are some other essential paradigms

**Imperative** programming is about telling the machine what it should do. A simple program may look like this: request variables A, print variable D. We simply describe the algorithm, the order of actions.

I'm not quite sure about other paradigms, huh? Perhaps there is a better way of describing programs written in imperative style)... However, before telling the program what it should do we describe some things (objects), which will later be used to state the program's purpose. We can describe, for example, a triangle: it is an object which has 3 sides, 3 angles, which are objects as well; they're objects of class Point, but I guess I'll just mention their existence and move along.

And then there is **functional** programming. Welp, it's hard not to see that after seeing some tiny bits of Haskell code), yet I can't fully grasp its main idea. Functional programming heavily relies on functions (quite expected, heh), but functions are present in imperative and OO languages as well (although I suppose they should be called *methods* if we're talking about OOP)...

TL;DR

* Build something you actually need right now.
* Port an existing
* Find a decent book on the language and read through it all as fast as you can.
* Mix action with equal parts learning (reading books/tutorials).
* Study reference works on public repositories.
* Devote large, to learning the new language.
* Learning a language shouldn‚Äôt just be a solitary endeavor.
* Use an editor with syntax highlighting.
* Working on a real project with real customers and deadlines is a white hot crucible for learning a new programming language.
* Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio: Learn at least one new language every year. Different languages solve the same problems in different ways.

Heaven help my future self or anybody ever looking through that code again

These days, and I just hope nobody notices. I feel as though I've been bullshitting it since I learned it, hoping that one day I would develop some serious standards. The reality is that at the beginning of each project, I swear to keep it spotless and maintain this rigid standard of perfect OOP, but it just never works out.

What is absolutely killing me is that I'm not even sure I'm making progress anymore. Every class I make, I'm sitting there for hours staring at the code trying to figure out a way around it. And the worst part is, I have no idea why the things I'm scared of are ""bad practice"" half of the time. I feel like I've just been spoonfed the principles of Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Abstraction, Decoupling, but I don't understand when it's okay to bend any of these rules. For me, and Abstraction. I put them in the same boat, my boat starts to sink.

For an example off the top of my head, and have it notify it about Y? Do I have a parent that's allowed to know about both things, and have IT be in charge of action Y and alerting X? I bullshit it, every time. I don't know the right way to handle it, and I've probably handled it EVERY way. That's probably a classic example of not wanting to couple these unrelated classes, but having two actions that inevitably happen in a related manner.

And then I sit there thinking, but then I don't. But I'm a pussy, and I avoid it, and I stare at my code trying to figure out how to do things the right way. 

I am at a loss of where to go from here, or ESPECIALLY any rules that you have for yourself. Any of that would be awesome to look at. If you'd like to include references to functional programming styles, or mixing in a functional style with OOP and identifying when that's a good choice, all of this would be terrific.

TL;DR I've hit a wall and have no confidence in breaking my code down into Object Oriented perfection

**[ Part 4: Group Behaviours and Ranged Attacks ]**

In Part 2 (Retreating) we briefly touched on how Fire Imps in each other's line of sight were connected as a group, with its Ranged Attacks. Combine Archers and Skeletons together and you have quite a challenging group of foes to deal with.

**[ Group Chasing Behaviours in Detail ]**

Let's break this group chasing behaviour down:

1 . **Detection Phase**. For each frame (more specifically each iteration of the Behaviour Tree), breadcrumbs dropped by both threats and friendlies are also recorded. In future versions, things like visible furniture, entrances and exit doors, walls etc... will also be added. By this point, the monster now has a reasonable view of the world on this exact frame, and we use this information to help the AI determine what to do next.

2 . **Intention Phase**. This is where the Behaviour Tree comes in handy - to aid in the decision making process. We'll not cover the specifics of the Behaviour Tree implementation here - the details are too numerous and will best fit in a future post. For an overview of Behaviour Trees

So, B. Follow alerted friendlies, C. Patrol. The first one we've already covered in Part 1: monsters chase after players in their line of sight, then breadcrumbs (smell trail), then to the target's last recorded location. If these actions fail - the next branch (priority) of the tree is parsed and the monster has a look at what the friendlies are up to. If his friends are alerted, this state is passed on and the monster becomes alerted also. He then proceeds to follow the alerted friend in the same way as in priority A (again line of sight, breadcrumbs, then we fall back to patrol (with best guess).

Priority B is particularly important - it allows the monsters to follow each other in a chain/queue-like fashion. As long as the leader of the pack is alerted and can see the enemy, so there's some failsafe hackery code to stop this from happening. This is WIP, we plan on cleaning up this behaviour during production.

3 . **Movement Phase**. Simply apply the intentions above to actual movement (modify velocities, separate from nearby entities etc..)

**[ Skeleton Archers and Ranged Attacks in Detail ]**

This is where the Behaviour Trees really shine. Because we've already defined a lot of the basic maneuvers described in Part 1, there is a conditional node that switches between Chasing Behaviours (from Part 1) and Retreating Behaviours (Part 2). The condition is a whether the distance from the monster to the player is above or below 2 thresholds. To illustrate, we might have an Archer chase the player if it is 100 units away, but flee from the player if it is less than 50. The gap between the 50 and 100 threshold is to ensure we don't rubber band between the two states too quickly, so if the distance is 75 units, we remain in the current state.

So the resulting behaviour is that the Archer maintains a nice position away from you: never to engage in melee combat but always close enough to use his bow and arrow.

**[ Conclusion ]**

Apart from the new Archer behaviours

**[ More Ideas for Group AI ]**

The above shows very basic

- Monsters won't attack if they are alone
- Wounded skeletons prefer to escape while their friends are locked in battle - to go and find corpses
- Leaders - if a Skeleton King is in the area
- Flanking - if the player is currently engaged in battle

**Part 3: Hungry Skeletons**

YouTube Video:

http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=cwRo_kM19Ek

Today I'm going to talk about some behaviours that are specific to the Skeleton monster. The idea is that while Skeletons are not chasing or pursuing the player, consumed corpses turn into more undead Skeletons! We build upon all of the behaviours discussed in the previous articles to do this.

The procedure is as follows:

1 .The Skeleton is in non-alert mode (character is not in line of sight

2 . If a player is detected

3 . When the Skeleton reaches the corpse, this is to give the impression that the Skeletons are busy eating to notice much else. Also, it is still in non-alert mode and will not smell any breadcrumbs. This opens up gameplay opportunities such as sneaking around a group of Skeletons who are busy munching!

4 . When the eaten variable exceeds a certain amount (ie. 200) the corpse is completely consumed. At this point some corpses (such as Orc corpses) turn into more Skeletons! This has the effect of a large cluster of corpses quickly propagating into multiple Skeletons

5 . At that's it

You guys helped me get my feet wet and find a starting point.  

I decided to learn python and completed the Code Academy classes in a few weeks then did the book linked in the subreddit faqs.  

I had the idea at work yesterday to write a program that could take in a word search field and then find any word you asked it to

I know there are much more elegant ways of doing it but I solved the problem by writing strings of each row

I finished it and it works as intended.  Even fool proofed the data input (mostly).  Also wrote it so it can take any size field (field size isn't hard coded).  It really feels great to have come up with my own challenge and then have the capability to complete that challenge (and in a way better than I expected).

So thanks /r/learnprogramming you got me off to a great start.

I'm 19. I went to college (in the UK) although my interest in programming dates back to when I was a young kid. I was the best in the class. Teaching students rather than lagging behind.

I've used Python, Java and plenty of web technologies (I work as a web developer).

I've been trying to learn more over the last 4 years

Writing this is pretty difficult. Everyone knows me as a programmer

You know how some people are bi-lingual and can think in more than one language? That's how I feel programming should be. Just being creative and getting my thoughts down into a terminal. But it's almost as if I need to make a completely conscious effort to get anything done nowadays.

I've had job offers from some huge companies and been completely terrified during the interviews. Well paid roles for my age that I don't feel comfortable taking part in.

I'm not usually a nervous person. I have an awesome social life. I have many hobbies other than programming. But there's just something frustrating about reading the same Ruby on Rails Tutorial I've read over 100 times before when I've been working professionally as a web developer for the past few years.

1317494808.0,kxo4c,Interested in a mentor program for programmers?,KAS_Esquire,94,16,48,"This might be the wrong place to post this

Earlier this year I posted a thread seeking advice to advance from an intermediate programmer to an expert. Amongst the great advice I received, it's difficult to find that kind of relationship. I work in a start-up with 3 engineers, and while my co-workers teach me a lot it's not the same as a mentor.

The purpose of this post is to determine if there's interest in the following idea, not sure - for programmers to be matched with mentors who can instruct them and help them advance their skills. Ideally the mentors would be proteges of someone else as well, so we are all benefiting. So you could specify that you are seeking someone to help you learn big data analysis, machine learning, map-reduce, RESTful API design, whatever, essentially getting free labour. Also

I think many of us have completed engineering or computer science degrees, and I think it would be beneficial to establish a community that helps us do that. r/learnprogramming is good start, but I think a more formal relationship with someone you can turn to regularly would be better. 

Looking forward to your feedback and criticism. Thanks!

The test was this: 


Basically it was a text to speech application. I was to create an algorithm so that for every number from $0.00 to $999


There were wav files for the words ""One"" through ""Twenty"", ""Fifty"", etc. Also ""Hundred"", ""Thousand"", ""Cents"", ""Dollars"", and ""and"".


For example


Towards the end I felt like I was getting closer but still missing the point of it. I was thinking there should have definitely been a recursive formula for it, and very hungry so I was relieved when it was finally over. I was clearly not ready to work there so oh well, live and learn.

1369353420.0,1exsrt,Interview question: Find the 1% of the file contents that satisfy a parameter,pornlord,91,13,48,"Disclaimer: This is a interview question
But I do not want to make the same mistake next time around

*Question:*  

There is a large networking log file of around 1GB or more, error report number,
start time

The difference between start and end time should be as less as possible. The longer it is

Your task, and display them or send them to a file. You can find the longest time by subtracting the start from end time. For purposes of convenience, let us not be concerned about the 24 hour time format, for the time being. That is request start at 23.59.00 and ends at 00.05.00

*My attempt:*  

The file is large, and keeping a lock on the log file.

I know what the file size is roughly around 1GB for this problem or could be more (does not matter much

So, that divides the actual size of the heap.

Now iterate over the log file line by line and keep inserting into the heap data structure. By end of the file iteration, I know when I iterate and print it to a file, I will have the longest delay request at the top and the others in descending orders.

I think

********************************************

So

What is the most appropriate language to go for this one? A heavy hammer language like C++, or Python. 

********************************************
********************************************

EDIT 1: As /u/lurgi pointed out, grams and kilograms.

/u/misho88 has pointed out that a priority queue is a good data structure. Priority queue unlike heap is flat, but that is not the point of the above exercise.

EDIT 2: /u/lurgi has pointed out that priority queues are implemented as heaps

EDIT 3:
Thank you all for the responses. All, that though file size is a challenge, but not a hindrance.

First the bloopers, rather than pulling values of my head while converting numbers with significant number of zeros.

/u/misho88 has pointed out that my estimates for line sizes were optimistic. I should have gone with a pessimistic estimate

/u/mrfooacct has pointed out, since I am only interested in the highest entries, the smaller entries will just not make it to the heap. This improves the time factor a lot, since I will not have to do any insertion or deletion in the min heap for 99% of my entries. As opposed to doing insertion deletion done previously in 100% of the entries, in case of max heaps.

/u/sumzup has effectively implemented a python code on the above lines

Another solution has been proposed by /u/__LikesPi especially the second entry. We assume we can give the percentile a actual number let us say 1,000 entries. We now choose a value k of increment steps, where k &gt; m say 5000 in this case. Now we read 5,000 entries at a time, and choose the 1,000 ones by using the selection algorithm, that he has already mentioned in the post. We then store these 1000 entries,000 entries that we get, with the 1

Other good solutions one proposed by /u/--jim-- is using a database query. I have used database, go over it, and use the DB API, to insert each of the lines in a DB log, and then let the data base puke out the entries, and redirect them to a file if you want. All the heavy lifting is done by the API, and thus less code and less chances of making a mistake.

/u/katyne gives a solution to a relevant problem

Thank you all for the responses. I am putting this entry as solved, and problem specific.

I am an aerospace engineering student with only one course's worth of knowledge in C.

Should I start learning to program in Objective-C, C# or Java first, and then transfer that knowledge over? My concern is efficiency. I don't have all the time in the world to be learning syntax that won't translate over to iOS development.

 I did try that one too

 1. I had to change the url  in

 to this 


            git@github.com:username/mydirectoryRepository.git

This will **push** the contents on your **local repository** to **github.com** account. Again thanks for the help.

 **UPDATE 2** : Adding additional folders from your local repo to github.com


 3. Okay When you created a new folder in your local repository containing some files in it. (As i came to know github doesn't accept empty folders to be synced). Heres what you need to do. 


 4. Do a pull so that git actually knows what you are doing ( [read this answer](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/1kf5tc/a_newbie_git_question/cboiuwy) )


          git pull origin master


 5. Now Add the new folders to the git stage.

The interactive demo can be found here:
[Dungeon Generation Demo](http://tinykeep.com/dungen/)

Here's how I do it

1 . First I set the number of cells I want to generate

2 . For each ""cell"" I spawn a Rectangle of random width and length within some radius. Again the radius doesn't matter too much

Instead of using uniformly distributed random numbers (the default Math.random generator in most languages)

In addition to this I ensure that the ratio between the width and length of each cell is not too large

3 . At this point we have 150 random cells in a small area

4 . We fill in any gaps with 1x1 sized cells. The result is that we end up with a square grid of differently sized cells

5 . Here is where the fun begins. We determine which of the cells in the grid are rooms - any cell with a width and height above a certain threshold is made into a room. Because of the Park-Miller Normal Distribution described earlier

6 . For the next stage we want to link each room together. To begin we construct a graph of all of the rooms' center points using [Delaunay Triangulation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation). So now all rooms are connected to each other without intersecting lines.

7 . Because we don't want every single room to be linked to every other with a corridor (that would make for a very confusing layout)

8 . The minimal spanning tree looks nice, each guaranteed to be reachable and containing some loops for variety.

9 . To convert the graph to corridors, perfect for a dungeon.

And here's an example of the finished result!

I've chosen python as the general consensus seems to be that it is pretty beginner friendly. I've only used code academy so far and whilst I'm finding it useful I'd love to know if its the best thing I could be doing.

Are there any other resources worth looking at for a beginner. I'd be particularly interested in anything that skews towards actual projects as I tend to learn faster by actually doing something.

1327894892.0,p2iu5,How do you guys deal with the frustration? ,mondomaniatrics,75,16,64,"I think one of the worst aspects of programming is the frustration it invokes. I worked in animation before I decided to part ways with art and get a degree in Computer Science. In all the years I worked in production

- Elitist/hostile help:

Let's say that I'm trying to learn a new framework or a language. I hit a wall, be it the Internet or an associate. What I'm met with is a condescending droll of responses that essentially say ""omg... you can't do X. You're supposed to do Y. This is so simple. How could you NOT know that? lol n00b!""

This does two things: I'm already pissed that I had to give up and ask a question. Now I'm pissed and I also feel like an idiot. This was a HUGE issue in college, and sometimes professors.

- Problem solved. Move on to next problem.

Some of my friends enjoy programming to the point that figuring out a bug or learning a new feature is like a scavenger hunt adventure. I used to be this way... until I started working as a developer on my own. Now, so it becomes my own scavenger hunt of ""Where did I fuck up?"" Couple this with the previous issue and my day just gets rosier and rosier.

- ""How long until you're done?""

I... HATE... this question. Mostly because I have no idea. Or because I've rarely done what I've been asked to do

When I worked in animation and production, I could spend a weekend implementing new features, but a client wouldn't know because it was all in the back-end. Optimizing code, memory management, parsing data are good examples.

- Idea, Profit

One of the most difficult aspects of programming is taking someone's expectations and immediately understand how to follow through into development to achieve the task at hand. I've found that the Internet is far from helpful in this regard, and a lot of wasted time.

- Given the points listed above

I dunno. Maybe it's just because I work in game development, I may not be the only one who loses their job.

Well,000 in 5 months, and think it's time that we breathed a little life into the community.  We're proposing several ideas here (some old, some new), and would like your feedback on all of them.  The admins will read through the responses, and **you** will decide which features get implemented.

If you have any other ideas, please voice them here.  The ideas are as follows:

**User Flair**:  
We're still thinking of implementing user flair appropriately, we have no way to effectively vouch for any given individuals capabilities in their field.  The replacement idea for this is to allow users to have flair that designates their _languages of interest_.  This doesn't necessarily imply competency, but will allow users with similar interests to easily identify with one another

**Post Tags**:  
Adding post-tags (similar to what is implemented in /r/buildapc).  Different tags will apply different styling to posts, questions and more easily identifiable from the home page.

**Self-Posts Only**:  
Allowing only self-posts within the /r/learnprogramming subreddit was the most widely accepted idea we proposed.  This is still on the table

**Custom CSS**:  
This is just adding some custom styling to the subreddit to give it a unique feel from the default ""reddit theme"".

I've been reading up lately on OpenGL and have been interested in learning to utilize it for some hobby graphics programming.  I'm having a hard time understanding how to get around to using it because OpenGL is 'open standard' and not 'open source'.  I don't know what APIs to find and use or what would be good for me.  

I mainly use Windows

I've been reading that Direct3D has a massive market share (understandably. I really only play video games on my Windows partition!)  It has good driver support and the entire DirectX suite (input/sound/etc.).

I'm not too keen on using GLUT to learn OpenGL because I feel it may be outdated and a little too simple for what I would like to eventually create.

I've been searching for about an hour and a half now

I've found OpenSceneGraph.  Is that something I should look into using?  The Direct3D API seems easy enough to get a hold of.  I have VS2010 and the 2011 beta installed

I know that John Carmack spoke out and basically said that the DirectX api is ""better"" than OpenGL and related extensions.  I would start with that

So anyone who frequents this subreddit has probably seen me complain about the FAQ being terrible (and not really being a FAQ at all) at least once.  And for all my complaining

About a week and a half ago I started work on a real FAQ.  As it turned out, we received some good input here and there from other well known /r/learnprogramming regulars, and we've finally got something that I consider to be a legitimate FAQ.

In actuality, some frequently asked questions, and a bunch of resources, many of which are pulled from [this great comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/comments/lpgg9/sites_like_codecademy/c2ukpz7) by /u/robot_zombie.

The current version of the FAQ is aimed at the essential beginner questions that get asked here very frequently. There is certainly room for more questions, = vs. ==, etc). We believe that the FAQ should focus on teaching people how to fish, not categorizing and outlining every single problem a learning programmer might possibly run into. StackOverflow covers that pretty well already.

As far as the resources section is concerned, mostly because some of the best and most important books in the field of computer programming cost money.  There are also links to external lists of resources, which may contain a mix of free and non-free resources.

So here's the new FAQ: http://www.reddit.com/r/learnprogramming/faq

1-  What is the difference in coding and programming

2-  What do operating systems have to do with languages? (Like can you learn the same languages for osx and will they work on windows / linux. Can you learn to program for ios and will it work on android?)

4-  I read about back-end and front-end programming. Does this apply only to web development or is this needed to program anything from an app to software?

5-  Do you need to know 1 language for each operating system or do you need to know many languages in each operating system to do web development / create software / develop a game etc. 

6-  Can I learn how to program for all major operating systems (IOS / Android / Windows / OSX) and learn how to create apps / games / websites / software etc. (not major things just small and little ones) in 2 years if i dedicate myself fully to learning programming?

1349716904.0,1159zg,Why did I fail the coding test?,Garee,66,12,30,"After submitting my resume to Amazon I was given an online coding test to complete that consisted of two questions. Unfortunately I was unsuccessful and they did not provide feedback at such an early stage of the process.

**Problem 1**

Given a zero-indexed array of integers A[N],R) such that:

    0 ‚â§ P &lt; Q &lt; R &lt; N
    A[P] &gt; A[P+1] &gt; ... &gt; A[Q] (strictly decreasing)
    A[Q] &lt; A[Q+1] &lt; ... &lt; A[R] (strictly increasing)

The depth of a pit is defined as:

    min{A[P] ‚àí A[Q]

Write a function deepest_pit(A) which returns the depth of the deepest pit in array A or -1 if it does not exit.

1. N is an integer within the range [1..1
2. Each element of array A is an integer within the range [‚àí100,000,000].

**My Solution**

    def pit_depth(a, r):
        return min(a[p]-a[q]

    def deepest_pit(a):
        deepest = 0
        p, -1, -1)
        for i in xrange(len(a)):
            if q &lt; 0 and a[i] &gt;= a[i-1]:
                q = i-1
            if (q &gt;= 0 and r &lt; 0) and (a[i] &lt;= a[i-1] or i+1 == len(a)):
                r = i-1
                deepest = max(deepest, q, r))
                p = i-1
                q = r = -1
        return deepest if deepest else -1


**Problem 2**

A string is a palindrome if it has exactly the same sequence of characters when read left-to-right as it has when read right-to-left. For example
    
    ""kayak""
    ""Rats live on no evil star""
    ""Able was I ere I saw Elba.

A string A is an anagram of a string B if A can be obtained from B by rearranging the characters. For example

    ""mary"" and ""army""
    ""rocketboys"" and ""octobersky""

Write a function isAnagramOfPalindrome(S) that

1. N is an integer within the range [1..100
2. String S consists only of English lower-case letters (a-z).
3. Expected worst-case time complexity is O(n)
4. Expected worst-case space complexity is O(1)

**My Solution**

    def isEven(n):
         return n % 2 == 0

    def isAnagramOfPalindrome(s):
        letter_counts = [s.count(c) for c in set(s)]
        n_even = len([n for n in letter_counts if isEven(n)])
        n_odd = len(letter_counts) - n_even
        can_be_palindrome = n_odd &lt;= 1
        only_palindrome = n_even &lt;= 1 if (s == s[::-1]) else False
        if can_be_palindrome and not only_palindrome:
            return 1
        return 0

The Huffman class (which is awesome) comes out with a new lesson each week so you have to wait

At first I wondered if the 101 would be too simple as I've done some reading and several tutorials - enough to know the basics. Man

The 101 is kicking my tail. And I like it. 

The problems/homework aren't designed to test whether you learned what was taught. Instead they are designed to test whether you are able to engineer a solution to a problem using the tools taught. Sometimes this has caused quite a bit of brain-hurt. It's also very rewarding when you get it to work. 

After going through codecademy it took me a while to catch on that there wasn't one right answer. codecademy tests for some pretty specific stuff. But Udacity just says

I'm on lesson 4 in the 101 and getting pretty addicted. 

Anyone else loving the udacity abuse? 

**Edit:** It sounds like during round 1 you didn't get a lot of feedback. Now that the 101 course is self paced you get instant feedback. You are presented with several test cases up front to code for and when you submit your code it tells you exactly which one of the additional test cases your code failed for.

Also, after not finding a programming position for a few months and with much less self-confidence, I feel that I am slowly losing any knowledge that I gained during college.

Can anybody help me find any open source projects, or any advice on what you would do in my situation?  I'm just looking for some guidance but I'm afraid that I'm slowly losing my way.  Thanks.

**EDIT-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

Sorry guys I should've put in what technical skills I had in the first place.  I just got back from work now.  Anyway

I started learning how to program with C++ and that is what I am most comfortable with/have the most knowledge in.

I also learned some C and Java and started teaching myself Python for fun.  I should probably go back and learn C and Java more in-depth before moving on to another language though.

I taught myself basic HTML and CSS and bought a book on PHP to teach myself how to write more dynamic websites.  I enjoy creating design concepts of websites and I really want to be able actually create them.  This is kind of my creative outlet I guess.

In terms of experience with any programming projects that I've done in school: I created a very basic openGL game in C

For example, but I'm pretty proud of it. It's my biggest project to date (with the exception of websites). https://github.com/ckbrumb/distro_sync

Part of my problem (perhaps the root of it all?) is that I've always been a ""base-level"" guy...pretty much in anything I do. A recent example being, so I did things the hard way and wrote a lot of (mostly procedural) code to get tasks done. Now, even though I understand libraries and their uses, I still find myself int he habit (often without even considering the other options) of try tasks at the base level. In the case of my xml parsing, I spent days trying to parse xml with regular expressions, which hasn't worked out very well.

Okay, I'd say I'm more task-oriented. I have little motivation for most hobbies in my life unless I have a task in mind. Any ideas on an undertaking that would push me over this plateau? Perhaps one that will teach me some of the more ""expert""-level techniques? Should I stick with Ruby for it, or should I take up another language concurrently.

Here's a summary of the competition:
The compeitition is game based: a tetris style game drops ""packs"" with certain values on each block inside the pack.  Packs are of varying size which is randomly decided at runtime.  This information, height of the game map (I might be wrong, but I'm pretty sure the width and height are of the game map.  the documentation is kind of difficult), square root of the pack (packs are always square so you can also think of this as the length of one side of the square), and finally the sum needed to remove blocks from the playing field (e.g. if the sum is 5 and you drop a 3 block onto a 2 block, those blocks are removed).

The above five parameters are initially given as standard input to the program (e.g. scanf in C).  After that

The player solves the program by writing his or her solution in the programming language of his or her choice.  All information passed to the compiler at runtime is taken in as standard input.  After downloading the game client

I think this is a really cool competition and great practice for those wanting to hone their programming skills.  If you guys have any questions feel free to comment or inbox me.

 * Extremely friendly to first-time collaborators
 * In its infancy. As of now (6/9/2013) it really doesn't do anything. Let's get it functional
 * As of 6/9/2013 there is only a build system (GNU Make) for Linux. If you set up a project for it on Windows or OS X submit it as a contribution! Anything helps.

If you have any questions you can find my e-mail on my Github account page. Or send me a tweet @palistov. Also if anyone wants to set up an IRC channel that can be a means of communication as well.


**What?**

Bakge! While it is a game engine, utility code, class hierarchy for game world objects, unit tests, bugfixes, documentation and more. You can search Twitter for the hashtag #bakge for tweets on progress, etc.


**Where?**

http://github.com/palistov/bakge


**When?**

Whenever it tickles your fancy.


**Why?**

This is a big one. Why? Personally I think it's important because the days of coding alone in a dark room by yourself are over. Software engineering these days is all about collaboration and communicating with fellow developers. This is an excellent starting point because not only will you learn the ins and outs of working with git


As a CS student myself


**How?**

Help in any way you can. Seriously.

* Hit up the [issues](https://github.com/palistov/bakge/issues) page and see if you can do anything.
* Build the engine and mess around with test programs. Find bugs and report them on the issues page. 
* Check out the DESIGN documents and add your input on how Bakge will be built.
* Spread the word. Tell your programmer buddies about it. Have them take a look. Show them how easy it is to help. Shove it in their faces! Tweet with the hashtag #bakge to sing in your birdie voice or whatever.
* Offer your advice. If you're an experienced programmer or open source developer
* Teach. If you're perusing the code and spot a bug that hasn't been caught


In the spirit of collaboration

I am not a seasoned developer and am light years away from any software engineer in terms of education and understanding

I'm the guy who knows a little about a lot

I've made things using HTML, JavaScript, Python, C, Lua, Ruby (Rails) and probably some other I'm not recalling at the moment.  These 'things' were with knowledge garnered on the fly with little in the way of delving deeper into the various other methods of solving the same problem.  

So, articles, etc. over the years - some concentrating on just OOP - which has gained me an extensive vocabulary on the subject. But the vocabulary means shit-all if I don't know how to put it to use.

I'm a strong advocate of learn by doing - which is exactly what I've done this entire time.  If I didn't understand something or needed to know a way of going about getting something done, I have never made anything worth much, so the latter is no gloat.

    Car has four wheels
    Car has four doors
    Car has 2 cup holders

    make new object from Car
    call car.color

BOOM! Now you know OOP...  I can make brown cars all day long using that same method

Right now, classes, methods, chaining, prototypes (work w/JS), etc. it all seems to go right over my head... Like, I can't even get a tiny grasp on it.

From what I've seen in the reddit community and heard from other people I know who program professionally it doesn't seem like I'm learning anything of practical value in my classes. I'll break down my CS courses that I've taken so far for easy reading.

Year 1
Class - CS108 - Computing Fundamentals  
Language - C  
What I Was Taught - This was the first programming course that I took as a freshman. It taught about the fundamentals of programming including basic syntax, file I/O, functions, pointers, and we briefly touched on structs. The class was shown how the things listed above worked but that was about it. We used cygwin and wrote all of our homework assignments using the command line.  

Year 1
Class - CS220 - Computer Organization  
Language - N/A  
What I Was Taught - This class focused on computer architecture. We learned about the von Neumann model, machine code, assembly code, and microprogramming.  

Class CS324 - Internet Tools in Windows  
Language - HTML/PHP  
What I Was Taught - This class taught me about web programming

Year 2
Class - CS240 - Data Structures and Algorithms  
Language - C++  
What I Was Taught - This class was about data structures and sorting/searching algorithms. I learned about multi-dimensional arrays, deques, vectors, linked lists, hash tables, and trees. Also recursion, sorting algorithms (bubble, etc. etc.), I was pretty much just shown how these things worked and we wrote all homework programs using the command line in cygwin.  

Year 2
Class - CS307 - UNIX Programming Environment  
Language - N/A  
What I Was Taught - This class was an introduction to UNIX. We learned about many of the different commands and what they do (too many to list here). We also learned a little about scripting in UNIX. This was probably the most practical class I've taken thus far since we were actually in a computer lab and the teacher encouraged us to play around with commands while he was teaching.  

Year 3
Class - CS249 - Object Oriented Programming  
Language - Java  
What I Was Taught - This class was all about object oriented programming. For the first few weeks it was just a java version of my CS108 class. Then we moved on to classes/objects/methods, and interfaces. The last two weeks of the course was spent on GUIs and applets. The professor wanted us to use UNIX or cygwin command line to write, compile, and execute our programs but over last summer I discovered the wonder of IDEs and have taken to using Netbeans for everything.  

So there you have it. Please note that the school I'm attending does not offer courses in the following languages: Python, Visual C++, Ruby, CSS, and ASP.NET. I really wish it did offer classes in more languages but it looks like I'm stuck with C/C++/Java without doing any independent study. I am teaching myself C# though. Let me know what you think and what languages I should be looking into learning myself to become more marketable.

That is my current code and it's not quite holding up when I want to print it (print the entire matrix in console). I'm using the Generic Type since that seem'd like what [this](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/512aeb7t.aspx) page was doing too.

So, how should I make the matrix?

Thanks in advance!
