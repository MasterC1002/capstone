In my youth I was a huge Nintendo fan. My mum got me a Super Nintendo when I was about five years old, and I even imported a Nintendo DS from America before they even came out in Europe.

My whole life i've received what could be basically described as a lot of shit for being a Nintendo fan. At secondary school people called the Gamecube a ""Gaycube"", who are now adults feel that the Nintendo Wii U is a kiddy console, with poor graphics and no games.

Since around 2005 I have also been big on PC gaming, CSS, Half life 2 and other games of the era. Now this is why I have always felt Nintendo and PC gaming go hand in hand. Basically, I have my Nintendo console for my multi-player couch games, melee and Mario Kart etc. I have my PC for my single player non Nintendo games, which have recently included games such as GTA4 and Bioshock, games which I can not play on Nintendo.

I suppose how I feel is that the reason I get a Nintendo console is sorely for the Nintendo games. I think Nintendo is great, PC Gaming covers my competitive side and I guess my more mature side, playing shooting games like CS:GO, Dota2 and other games which you don't get on Nintendo.

This is why I feel XBOX and PS3 users have always missed the point. Games such as GTA, usually with better graphics and support. But if I wanted to play Mario? Well only Nintendo can cover that. And that is why I feel Nintendo and PC gaming go hand in hand! The best of both worlds, together, and it covers nearly every game I want to play (other than Red Dead Redpemtion, but it's an easy trade when compared to Super Mario Galaxies 2!).",,False,t5_2qhnk,True

I knew my end was near.. Then, SUDDENLY, a stroke of luck appeared!! A warp star appears in the center stage.

1369066755.0,1ep8xb,[A Nintendo Fan] Why I am sick and tired of Electronic Arts' bullshit. (Also posted on r/games),Exoma,316,73,110,"Since I can remember

I began to notice this with their sports franchises; Madden, etc. and how little effort they would put into their Nintendo ports. 

In fact, EA has always provided Nintendo with poor games and has blamed Nintendo for the lack of EA sales.

FIFA

I remember feeling so ripped off with the 2006 FIFA World Cup game for the Gamecube. Not only was it riddled with bugs (Bugs that were not present in the PS2 version of the game) but they had literally mismatched the faces for certain players in the game

FIFA 13 for the Wii U is a scam. It is NOT the same game as FIFA 13 for the PS3 and Xbox 360. It uses the FIFA 12 engine and is riddled with bugs. 
1.
Sometimes the game will just randomly call a penalty shot for no reason

2.
FIFA has completely taken out Creation Centre

3.
The simulation of a season takes longer than on the PS3. (Keep in mind 2GB of RAM vs 256MB of RAM.)


The reason most people buy FIFA now is because of 1. The gameplay mechanics and 2. Creation Centre. Both of these things are not present in the Wii U version of FIFA.

Who does EA blame? Nintendo. Who suffers? The consumer. I felt robbed.

Origin From what I know

Crysis

I don't believe all this crap about Crysis 3 not being able to run on the Wii U. I just don't believe it and you shouldn't either. This was obviously a business disagreement between Nintendo and EA and I assume it was another case of Nintendo not putting up with EA's bullshit. 

http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/crytek-says-that-its-nintendo-wii-u-version-of-crysis-3-had-to-die/

Digital Trends also has an article stating nearly the same thing. 

EA's smear campaign

Electronic Arts has begun a smear campaign against Nintendo what with all these tweets from EA employees like Bob Summerwill calling the Wii U ""Crap"". It's really annoying. In fact

Why don't you just buy the game on PS3/Xbox 360 and quit your bitching

I'm glad you asked. The reason I would rather buy it on the Wii U is because of the Gamepad. I like it. I really really like it. When Nintendo first announced the system

SimCity and NHL are great examples. EA's Origin DRM feature is what in my opinion completely ruined SimCity. EA lied to its customers

NHL has been the exact same thing every year. In fact, 12 then to 13. And boy am I fed up.

So am I happy EA is no longer making games for Nintendo? YES. I am very happy

YES because I will now be able to close my Origin account for good.

YES because now I can spend my money on games created by independent developers that don't have evil business strategies. 

YES because now I can stick to Pro Evolution Soccer without double guessing myself.

So thank you

PS: I'd like to apologize for any spelling or grammar errors.

1370268593.0,1fkxl7,Itching for some new Smash Bros? Try out this 77-stage version of Project M!,Garbagehead4,248,42,151,"**NEW TO PROJECT M?**

Generally speaking, here is no need to hack your Wii in order to play it. This description doesn't exactly do the game justice, I recommend you check out the P:M website for a more complete summary: http://projectm.dantarion.com/about/
Also

**Keep in mind that Project M is still a demo.** Not all the characters have been finished yet

I've come to realize that Project M could easily become *the* definitive Smash game. It's the skill ceiling of Melee, I found the stage selection a bit lacking after playing for hours on end. That's where my 77 stage build comes in. 

Here's photos of the Stage Select Screen (SSS): http://imgur.com/a/zt8qT The images were uploaded twice for some reason

So what do you need to get Project M? There are a number of ways to go about this

* A Wii

* A copy of Brawl

* A 1GB or 2GB SD card (important!)

* A computer that reads SD cards

Why the SD card size limit? Because under normal circumstances

So you've got all the stuff together

* First of all, you won't regret doing so).

* Next

* Insert your SD card into your Wii and start Brawl like normal. Go to stage builder. Some text should flash on screen and a menu will appear. Select 'Launch Game'.

That's all there is to it! Have fun smashing!

**REASONS TO DOWNLOAD:**
If you want a cumulative collection of stages from the entire Smash series, if you're a complete n00b to Project M, this is a great opportunity to get started.

**REASONS TO NOT DOWNLOAD:**
If random stage selection and stage striking are critical to your gameplay. Certain stages will never be selected when random is pressed, download as you see fit.

**DOWNLOAD**

* Download the .rar file: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0B1XVf-zdlELwMVBoUnpRQXVTams/edit?usp=sharing (approx. 500MB)

* Extract all the files to an empty 1 or 2 GB SD card.

* Remember to delete your custom stages in normal Brawl if you haven't already

**STAGE LIST**

* Aquatic Ruin Zone
* The Whirl Islands
* Mushroom Kingdom (New Super Mario Bros)

Major props go out to the Project M development team, thank you to all the stage creators out there, you know who you are.

Why should Nintendo target the adult male gamer when everyone else is already doing that? Who would fill for the fans that Nintendo currently caters to? Do you understand that Nintendo is literally the only developer in the industry making high quality games NOT aimed at the typical gamer?

1371100181.0,1g90c0,"I played all games at the Best Buy booth. Here's my very detailed impressions, and what I noticed.",Wiwiweb,175,12,http://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1g90c0/i_played_all_games_at_the_best_buy_booth_heres_my/, most people chose Mario 3D World or Mario Kart

The Best Buy staff in charge of the stand were pretty well organized

I registered once to play Mario 3D World

However while most of the people left after they signed, and I ended up playing all games, and most levels. I could observe the others playing too.

Here's a breakdown per game:

**Super Mario 3D World:**

* Compared to NSMB, who only have to jump and barely aim to free them. The 1up counter is shared by all players, so that worse players are not forced to stop playing. Players who die come back in the Super form, instead of the small form. And finally, players have a shared pool of up to 4 stored items when someone who already has an item picks one up. I'm guessing that unless you really fuck up, you'll pretty much always have fire, racoon or cat.
* The cat suit: Pretty cool. You can climb walls, it kinda feels like you're flying. The claw attack seemed like an improved version of the tail attack of the racoon suit. Very easy to use and kill everything, even bullet bills. If you touch the flag at any point, the cat will climb to the top and get a 1up, which feels a bit like cheating, especially given the point system (more on that later). Finally the ""meows"" are pretty cute :3.
* First level is basic mario level
* Second level shows off the fire suit and the transparent pipes. I have to say this was my favorite level. While in a pipe
* The third level had bullet bills and cat suit. You could use the cat suit with wall conveyors to go find secrets.
* The fourth level is the aquatic yoshi dinosaur. Everybody can control it and make it jump! Very chaotic! At some point there is a secret behind a waterfall, making us fall to our doom. Pretty fun chaos.
* The final level is a boss battle against a snake king. For some reason the moving platform to go to the boss doesn't need all players on it to start moving. Players who are lagging behind will fall to their doom, you can even climb the snake minions and not have to wait for them to go down. The boss goes down fast. While the rest of the levels had a clear NSMB feel, this boss reminded me more of Mario Galaxy, especially the design.
* The score: Nintendo had a great idea to create a little competition between players based on score. After every level, it was sometimes a bit unfair. The boss gave more points for the final blow, so the one doing that blow usually wins, regardless of the rest. The yoshi gives points equally to all players, so it only comes down to the flag at the end. Flag which by the way, give insane amount of points if you reach the top (10k), often doubling your total.
* Some details: Item blocks dont pop all 4 items at once like in NSMB, hehehe). Small blue toad has the mini mushroom colors (blue with white dots) while his fire form is orange with red dots. Small peach is a chibi version of herself (quite cute :o) while her fire form is a white dress with red ribbon. The small Mario and Luigi dont have caps. The 4th level with the aquatic yoshi dinosaur thing has [SMB64's rainbow ride music](http://youtu.be/JUJ_cr11PSY)! Also the death sound is [from smb3](http://youtu.be/OFX8-ctkQqY).
* Overall I liked it

**Mario Kart 8:**

* The demo was limited to 2 players. The game still has 12 racers, how much does the first player get hit with, aka, is it as bad as MKWii. Unfortunately, it seems powerful items were turned off for the demo. The best item available for last players was the golden mushroom. The rest was just the regular items + spinning triple shells and fire flowers. Also Toadette and Koopa were there.
* You can play with a single Wiimote or the Wii U controller. I'm guessing the Nunchuk too, another huuuuuge advantage :D. In addition, you can show the map, which has a little 3D effect. Even with this effect, some maps like the Mobius Strip are quite confusing to look at on a 2d plane.
* There were 3 tracks. The first track was the Mobius Strip, with upside down signs and even a castle, however it doesn't actually change much on a gameplay side. It also has a short aerial section over regular road which, just like on MK7, doesn't matter much.
* The second track is Toad's Town. We can see here that the ""driving on walls and ceilings"" can make maps quite interesting. Even in this simple track
* The third track was the Boo Manor, players driving at 90 degrees on both sides of the room, kinda like some tracks in FZero GX. My favorite part is when you are driving on a wall, towards the floor, and you enter a body of water in the mouth of a statue. It feels like you're going through a wall made of water. There is also an aerial section which is actually a little significant, as you can get coins and an alternate path.
* The anti-gravity gimmick is pretty good, the gameplay doesn't change a bit. Just like underwater driving from MK7, it's seems to be almost purely a graphical gimmick. I noticed one thing, if you bump into another racer while in anti-gravity, both will spin around and lose a bit of speed.
* A positive point: The game is BEAUTIFUL. There are details everywhere during the tracks

**Wind Waker HD:**

* As this was single player
* You play with the Wii U Controller. A is rolling, for quick reassignment of the items to your buttons, Map, which showed nothing in the demo (blank map), but will be for the World Map, and Bottles, which isn't for potions (that's inventory) but for the new Miiverse function (more on that later).
* You could run around on Outset Island
* I used the rest of my time to check out Outset Island. I couldn't advance in the story, in that Bottles tab. Including drawings and screenshots! For the demo, the messages were fake, but I thought the idea was cool.
* On a graphical side I wasn't impressed. Though it's obviously better than the original, so they could have done a bit more work on it in my opinion.

**Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze:**

* Nobody wanted to play this game! I was only able to play it once near the end. There are 4 levels but I could only see the first one and the minecart one.
* It's pretty much more DKCR. There's some neat camera effects during barrel sequences, then flips the last one over using a barrel.
* I noticed players have 3 hearts right from the start instead of 2. Though hopefully that might be for the demo only.
* I think the game is gonna be good

That's it. A lot of details for those who like that. All in all I don't regret spending almost 3 hours there. While waiting, Luigi foam cap, Luigi racing flag, Animal Crossing 3DS sticker skin, 4 Animal crossing pins) and even something like 30 puzzle pieces from Streetpass :P
I might return Saturday to play with friends. I think there's gonna be even more people

I gotta say

I believe that the Wii U gives Nintendo the **PERFECT** opportunity to create a Four Swords experience that has the potential to reach a much wider audience. The technology today required for this to come to fruition is widespread. Think about these two options:

1. Four player local multiplayer utilising 4 Nintendo 3DS systems. 

2. Online multiplayer utilising the Wii U gamepad. 

Nintendo can even mix these around and make it more customisable in order for us customers to have the best opportunity of always playing the game the way it should be; with three other players. For example, and the 4th is playing over the Internet from his/her Wii U. If Nintendo were to add more advanced features like opening parties up to the public, allowing players to drop into other people parties akin to Diablo, then you are pretty much guaranteed to always be able to explore Hyrule as a group of 4.

The crucial point to note here is that the infrastructure and technology is all available to make this a reality. Whether or not Nintendo would go along with it may merely be a pipe-dream (for now at least).

I was *this* close to hopping in my car and driving there

The store manager of my local gamestop turned out to be a complete doofus, and I could just hear his attention pique. I was immediately suspicious of him. Especially when he tried to end our phone call briskly, saying ""Ok I'll give them a call and let you know when it's in.""

""...Umm

""...oh yeah.""

""And my phone number?""

""....Yes.""

Well, and went in to pick the game up.

I was flabbergasted. Only two people even new I'd set this up

""I got that impression...""

Did you get that impression because THEY LIED AND SAID THAT TO YOU?!?! She really kept skirting the answer.

There's nothing I can do about this

TL;DR: I set up a store to store transfer of Xenoblade

If this doesn't sound like your cup of tea


**1) Make sales Weekly**

Nintendo occasionally does sales on the eShop. Such as right now they're doing on. And these are great! It encourages people to buy the games, something steam sized, but just once a week lower some random game a few bucks, and just watch it's sales go up. It's really simple, makes Nintendo look good in the eyes of gamers for doing sales all the time, and Nintendo gets extra cash. Everyone wins!


**2) Put DS games on the eShop**

The DS had a spectacular library! I don't think people would argue this fact. It had great RPGs, the DS is slowly beginning to fade away, but that doesn't mean the profits from it have to fade too. Simply put DS games on the eShop for say, $20-$30 for each one? I know there are plenty of DS games I haven't been able to play or find now that I wouldn't mind paying a digital copy for. It's the perfect way for Nintendo to continue to get profits from already successful games like Super Mario 64 DS, Kirby Super Star Ultra, and to give games that weren't so successful a second chance on the digital market, like Chibi-Robo Park Patrol. There is plenty of money still in the DS library


**3) Put 3D Movies on the eShop**

Anyone remember E3 2010? Remember how Nintendo announced that they had planned with Warner Bros., such as How to Train your Dragon, and Tangled? What ever happened to that? And don't say that's what Netflix is, go watch the E3 videos yourself, there is no mention of Netflix, it's strictly Nintendo and these Movies companies. Whatever happened to this? The 3DS has a special place in the market for being one of the cheapest 3D devices out there. Thus, it could easily be a great place to release 3D movies on. Can you imagine just how exciting that would be to watch a movie in your own home in 3D? Nintendo can seriously take advantage of this odd monopoly over 3D movies, this is probably the hardest thing on the list to achieve


**4) Revive the first and second generations of Pokemon on the 3DS**

You might think ""Well gee, you can't deny that it's insanely popular. And having Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow/Gold/Silver/Crystal on the eShop would sell like hotcakes. Heck, they could charge $10 for each game, and people would STILL buy it. Just as long as they had a decent emulator running them, so wireless trading and battling was possible, Gameboy Printer saved imaged to the 3DS Camera instead, etc. But why just stop there? Remake the Pokemon Pikachu pedometer as an app for the 3DS that still has functionality with the Gold/Silver/Crystal games, profit. Make a Pokemon Stadium 3DS App where you could do wi-Fi battles with Gen I/II battle mechanics online, Pokemon Stadium online and in 3D. Charge $15 for that


Anyways, they've probaby already planned on bring them to the 3DS.) And Miiverse accounts tied to purchases, and bring the Miiverse to the 3DS, which I believe they've already stated they plan on doing so in the future. What do you guys think? Do these reasons sound possible, or are they absurd?",,False,t5_2qhnk,True

Let me know what you guys think

**Mushroom Kingdom**

Of course

*Peach's Castle*

This is where the gigantic arcade facility would be. I would hope that they would have every Nintendo licensed arcade cabinet in existence there, and a bunch of Wii U systems or whatever other gaming system is the newest stuff so a bunch of people can play together. Lots of different systems with Mario Kart, Smash Bros., Star Fox, Goldeneye, etc.. They could have virtual reality games, too. Also, and the rooms would be decorated to look like the worlds in the game.

**EDIT:** *Luigi's Mansion*

A classic haunted house where you get to run around and get scared by the ghosts. Maybe you also get a little flashlight at the beginning that lets you scare the ghosts away yourself

Thanks

*Mario Kart (Double Dash Battle Mode)*

These are basically bumper cars. I think probably the best way to do this is to have it kind of like the Buzz Lightyear bumper cars in the Disney arcade at Disney World in Florida. In that, it's cannonballs) and another shooting ball things from a cannon at other cars. When the balls hit certain spots on the car, the bumper car spins out for a few seconds. Of course, you would have to have different items than just balls. We want turtle shells! Most points wins.

*World 1-1*

This is an obstacle course that's designed to give you the real platforming experience of Super Mario Bros. It's basically a real-live version of World 1-1 from Super Mario Bros., and kick Koopa shells. A few people can go at a time, like maybe four. You all wear hats (Mario, Luigi, Wario, Waluigi) because that's fun.

*World 8-4*

This is a show at the end of the night where Mario battles Bowser. It’s a pyrotechnic spectacular.

**Hyrule**

*Link's Archery Practice*

Yeah, but it would be a good attraction. They mention this in the video, and it would be fun. 

*Wind Waker Sailing Game*

This is a boat simulator thing. They have something similar to what I'm thinking at Disney World, and the others are all shooting cannons. There are projections on a panoramic screen all around you showing you how Link is doing (you can see him sailing the King of Red Lions nearby), and you are trying to shoot projected images of baddies and other cannon ships all around you. If Link gets inside Ganon’s fortress, you win.

**EDIT:** *Bombchu Bowling Alley*

I love this idea, /u/samueldlockhart

*Power

This is just a little bitty side thing where you answer some questions and you are assigned a piece of the Triforce, showing which piece you got.

*Triforce Pieces Search*

This is a little game to be played all over the park. You have a little card thing you carry around the park, too!

**Pokemon**

*Safari Zone*

You are given 3 pokeballs and go into a room where you can walk around a little bit. The room is basically a panoramic display of the Safari Zone from the games. Pretty soon, too (they’re located just on the floor in the room when you get in there). Of course, you are totally going to end up catching a pokemon every time, but it might take all three balls to do it. The pokemon that appears will be somewhat random, much like the real Safari Zones in the games. Once you actually capture the pokemon, you are given an AR card with that pokemon’s details on it. You can use this AR card not only to look at your pokemon through your 3DS AR reader, but also, and you can use and train it as you would a regular pokemon that you caught in-game! You can also buy a plushie of your pokemon in the gift shop and you can also get little accessories to decorate it (like bows and stuff).

*Pokemon Gym*

You can take that same card that you won in the Safari Zone and go to the Pokemon Gym. You scan the card when you go in the room

*HM 02 (Fly) Ride*

This is just a roller coaster where you get to ride on the back of a pokemon all over a miniaturized version of Kanto or whatever the most current region of pokemon there is. Nothing really special

**EDIT** *Pokemon SNAP!*

This is a boat ride where you can use your 3DS or your regular camera to take photos along the ride of pokemon or scenery. If you use your 3DS, I dunno. Daily, weekly and all time high scores posted as well as being able to purchase your photos. Thanks, /u/p0rtugalvii!

**Donkey Kong Country**

*Mine Cart Carnage*

This is, there is an animatronic Donkey Kong and Diddy Kong in the front of the cart.

*Donkey Kong Jungle Beat Show*

You need some sort of musical show in a park like this, just outside the show, there’s an area with lots of drums and bongos and stuff where kids can beat the drums to their hearts content.

**Star Fox**

*Do a Barrel Roll!*

I like the idea for the roller coaster that they show in that video that I linked to earlier. I wouldn’t change a thing. 

*Landmasters Vs. Arwings*

This is a little remote controlled attraction where you have fairly big (I mean like maybe 2 feet tall) Landmasters fighting against the Arwings (also pretty big

**Metroid**

*Samus’ Gunship* 

This is basically a slower ride thing where you’re in a cockpit and you shoot at stuff all around you

*Morph Ball...Something?*

I’m really not sure what else to do with Metroid

**EDIT:** *Metroid Arm Cannon Tag*

How about a Metroid maze

**Kirby’s Dream Land**

This is kind of an area for little kids. Cream puff stuff.

Stuff like a merry go-round where you can ride creatures from Kirby games. Not much else to say about it. Other little kid rides could be included in the area

*Gift shop idea:* You can sell lots of hats like Kirby wears in the games to show his abilities.

**EDIT:** **Animal Crossing Village**

I honestly have never played Animal crossing

*Tom's Nook*

An Animal Crossing Village where you can walk around, the train from Nintendo Land needs to be able to transport in that. Thanks, /u/Blizblob-The-Great!

*Log Flume*

This would be a log flume where you ride in a water type.

*Animal Crossing Lazy River*

It takes you through a river, /u/Ninjastar1234!

**Misc. Nintendo Franchises**

I wouldn’t want to dedicate an entire section of the park to Kid Icarus or F-Zero, you could have the Kid Icarus ride).

*Kid Icarus*

You fly along with Pit on a rollercoaster adventure to defeat baddies. 

*F-Zero*

REALLY FAST roller coaster. NOT for little kids. It has lots of loops, too.

*Punch Out!*

Giant poofy fist fighting

*Pilot Wings* 

Another fun roller coaster. Lots of dog fighting moves

**EDIT:** *Pikmin*

Pikmin would be a perfect rest stop. A park in the middle of the theme park with a Pikmin theme for people to sit down and eat their meals. Green grass, and props from the game. Those huge huge bottle caps would be perfect for tables and seats. In the trees they could plant the tiny clay figurines that they use for the game ads. Thanks, /u/PrivCaboose!

**EDIT:** *Wave Race*

These are bumper boats

Okay

Please put spoiler tags on any discussion of the winner!

---

---

---

Day 3 of the largest Super Smash Bros. tournament of all time, and expect finals to get even more hectic!

###**Bracket**

This is a double elimination format, they play each other in Grand Finals. The player coming from winner's side only has to win one set to eliminate their opponent and win the tournament, whereas the player from loser's would have to win two. Additionally, those getting sent to loser's bracket early have to play twice as many matches since the bracket keeps getting repopulated with people falling down from winner's. But it's not unheard of for people to survive the loser's gauntlet and come back to take the tournament, so don't write them off yet!

**Winner's bracket**  

* Hungrybox (Jigglypuff)
* Mew2King (Sheik/Marth) EDIT: Or Fox, I haven't seen him face Hungrybox in a while either, so I guess he just felt his Fox was a better matchup against Jiggs.
* Dr. PP (Falco)  
* Wobbles (Ice Climbers)  

**Loser's bracket**  

* Mango (Fox)  
* Armada (Peach)  
* Ice (Sheik)  
* Shroomed (Dr.Mario)

Worth noting that Armada has been the undisputed world champion and hasn't lost a single set in over 2 years... *until yesterday*. Anything can happen now after an upset like that

###**Yesterday's highlights**

For anyone who was watching other games yesterday and wondering why you kept hearing so much screaming coming from the Melee booth

* [Dr. PP vs Armada](http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo3/b/429937078?t=2h50m22s)  
* [Mango vs Wobbles](http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo3/b/429937078?t=4h30m46s)

Thanks to [classicalmusician](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fighters/comments/1i9fnl/missed_2nd_day_melee_heres_three_sets_showing/) for finding the exact timestamps of each set in Twitch's VOD.

###**Where to watch**

The stream will be at **http://www.twitch.tv/srkevo1**. I hope plenty of you tune in because it's going to be an awesome show!

They're also setting up for King of Fighters XIII right as I type this if you're interested in watching that too. After Melee will be a special trailer for a new DLC character in Injustice: Gods Among Us, then Ultimate Marvel vs. Capcom 3, followed by a trailer for the next iteration of Street Fighter 4, ending with the finals for Super Street Fighter 4 Arcade Edition v2012.

* According to the US Nintendo site

* It appears Nintendo didn't factor in Daylight Savings time when telling the Australians when it starts

* We **will** be getting release information for some games and there appears to be online multiplayer in some of the games being shown. [SOURCE](http://i.imgur.com/Zqs8Ilw.png)

* **Miiverse**. Showing people how to improve your experience on it. Miiverse characters with green ticks have been verified by Nintendo (Ex: Developers) and they can post links and embedded Youtube videos in their posts.

* **Two upgrades** coming in Spring and Summer (Northern Hemisphere seasons). Improve software launch times and load times.

* **VC coming after the spring system update!!** The lineup cannot be confirmed right now. NES and SNES are coming and games are being developed for the Wii U system! Gameboy Advance games also. People who have already bought a VC game on the Wii get a discounted prices on the new VC games which seems fair. They are playable on the TV and gamepad and interact with the Miiverse too.

* Not entirely sure about this discount price thingo. Looks good though. (30 year anniversary for something

* **Miiverse** users can create communities, add a filter function, and more to come (probably announced at E3) MIIVERSE COMING TO SMARTPHONES IN SPRING! (Browser only, but an app will be developed)

* **Games incoming!** Only a few titles released by Nintendo for WiiU in Jan/Feb because Nintendo want to improve gameplay rather than rush release.

* **The Wonderful 101** (game) with new footage. Appears to be a game similar to Star Fox 64. Looks pretty fun!

* **Bayonetta 2**- Not the right timing to discuss details about it. Video included though and the devs appear to be putting a lot into the game.

* **Smash Bros. Game** - May see it at 2013's E3

* **New titles** Mario Kart, Yoshi's Epic Yarn, new unknown game (Fire Emblem meets Shin Megami Tensei)

* **Legend of Zelda news** no visuals yet, play by yourself), talking about converting Zelda titles into HD (Showing Wind Waker)

* **Wind Waker** coming in fall/autumn. Upgrade graphics

* **New Xenoblade!**

* Seperate opportunity to talk about 3DS

My idea would be to add NintendoLand DLC not as purchases through the eShop but as addons bundles with other games. So If I buy Mario 3D World or MK8 I get a code to unlock more NintendoLand content (related to the bundle game). Every major WiiU release (including third parties and the more public facing indies) could be invited to join in. Buy Sonic: Lost World and get a four player version of the Sonic 2 special zone for NintendoLand.... 

It adds an incentive to purchase more software

It took me 3 tries

**GOOD:**

* Characters

This game has, and 9 years alter they still hold up well. I can't tell you how sad I felt when Mario and Peach were leaving on their boat to go back to their kingdom... and how glad I was when, after the credits, I was able to return to them post-shadow queen fight. I felt particularly bad for Vivian, who has no one (really) except for Mario, and who is still stuck with her horrible sisters after the game ends.

Character moments were many and great, though.

* Emotional

The ending was amazing. Perfect for the tone and style of the game - funny

* The levels

Glitzville.

I remembered it being awesome, creative, and it has suspense and mystery. It outshined the rest of the game's levels by quite a bit IMO.

The other levels were also great, but I have some complaints with them that I'll get to.

* Battle system

It's still awesome. It's varied

* Graphics

The game has aged very well. I love games with distinct art styles because they are pretty timeless. In many ways

**BAD:**

Let me stress this next bullet point......

* Backtracking

THE BACKTRACKING. TTYD would

Tracking down General White and Goldbob. Coming back from Keelhaul Key.... then having to go immediately back to find Frankie and Francesca... then having to go into the jungle to find their wedding ring. On Keelhaul Key, then finding Bobbery is hurt, then having to run back so Flavio gives you the Cola... then running back. TWILIGHT TOWN.... started so great, then you backtrack an insane, unhealthy amount of times. 

Glitzville shined because it had no backtracking. It had a completely unique level structure where it was, which looked cooler. And yet, it was 10x better than any other level... the characters in the locker room (King K!!!) were incredible. 

I can't tell whether the level designers felt their game was just too short without the backtracking, detracts from this game's status as a classic. This would be an indisputable classic without the backtracking. I frequently forgot this was a game from 2004 until.... yeah.

What difference does it make if Nintendo doesn't go to E3? What if E3 stopped being the spectacle we make it out to be? Does it really matter? Sure some of you may argue that a big part of the Wii U's success this year depends on consumer awareness, we know about the games and life goes on.

12.  There is a story about ""Blue Onigiri."" Kazumi Totaka (a.k.a., generally working himself to a stupor in the final days of Animal Crossing development, before the deadline to finish it. In the 5 minutes that he was walking from the nearest train station to his work, he mindlessly thought, ""Blue onigiri... That'd be sad, man..."" And just then, he finished the entirety of the song in his head. Onigiri has an image of playfulness, and youth in Japan, but really the song's name and melody were thought up while staring into space

The first email I get telling me to contact them came at 7:39 A.M. the second email telling me they canceled my order comes at 7:41 A.M.

I called the number given to me in the first email I received and was told they couldn't help me.  I asked to talk to a supervisor

Gave them my number and got a phone call right away

I did that and corporate transferred me to online billing.  This lady was extremely rude and kept interrupting me.  She told me to call back and talk to sales and I asked her ""Would sales be able to help me with this?""  And she said ""No.""  So I attempted to ask ""Why would I call sales if you're telling me they're also not able to help?""  She didn't have a reasonable answer

I called corporate once again and spoke to a real nice lady who tried best to help me

One thing I want to say about best buy, and since in the weeks past best buy was making the charge on Wednesday I assumed I would be good.  

The $50 gift card doesn't really help me if I'm going to have to wait a year to get a Wii U.  I was laid off last Christmas and I really didn't get to get my son the things I wanted to get him.  He still had a good Christmas I just wish I could have done more.  This year I thought was going to be the perfect Christmas for my son and now it's not looking like it is going to be.

If anyone here can help this go viral

The fact that they made Wind Waker HD is fucking incredible. The whole ditching the conventions of Zelda made me worried. I'm positive it will be great, but that Xenoblade-sequel game looks awesome. The Yoshi game literally looks like Yoshis Epic Yarn, disaapointed. I'm not a fan of the Fire Emblem series, but I'm sure the fans will love it. Wonderful 101 looks very fun.

I'm pretty sure most gamers aren't invested in gaming companies. If the Wii U doesn't shatter records or has a poor launch, DKCR

I like games to look nice just as much as anyone but to say that graphics define a game shouldn't be the case. Many times has it been stated that it's impossible to please gamers these days. If the price is low (Wii) it's cheap and for kids. If the price is expensive (PS3) it's not worth it. The main point I'm getting at is that I wish everyone could play the games they like without people who don't like a game/company to beat you down with insults and nonsense. I've been playing games a lot longer than many of those people and it's insulting.

EDIT: Glad we could talk about this peacefully. I didn't want this to be a Nintendo pity party or a Nintendo worship party so I'm glad that didn't happen either. I know Nintendo has huge flaws and I could've substituted Nintendo with another company but I'm more familiar with Nintendo.

**Please

Reddit is a news aggregate site. Linking to another news aggregate site defeats the point of making this one. Sites such as Joystiq always provide a source for their story

I know some of our submitters are submitting their own websites on r/Nintendo and that we're providing traffic for them. I've nothing against that, commentary, etc.

**Don't submit text on pre-existing images**

Basically

Memes kill conversation, or the goal for community.

But if you create an original comic (not ragefaces) that has a meme punchline

1370422384.0,1fpm1y,With WiiConnect24 ending on the 28th... anyone need MP3 Friend Vouchers?,miserablesecret,78,9,44,"On June 28th

For games like Smash Bros Brawl it's no big deal, which are earned  by receiving *Friend Vouchers* from other Metroid Prime 3 players. So after the 28th, you will no longer be able to earn Friend Vouchers, thus preventing the ability to legitimately earn the last of the gallery items.

I figured I'd start a little initiative to get people trading these things to help people unlock all the gallery items before the ability is lost.

In order to do this, you will be able to start MP3 and give vouchers to people in your Address Book who also have the game. You and the other person may need to each boot the game once to complete this process (I'm not sure).

I know MP3's an old game, too. Any takers?

My Wii System Code is `7274-3640-1041-7717`. I currently have `15` vouchers to give to people

**EDIT:** I'm not sure if Metroid Prime 3 and Trilogy can exchange friend vouchers

Just figured I would share my last few days in the world of gaming. Ironically on the day Mass Effect 3 comes out

The last few years it seems that gamers have really became jaded

I haven't used my PS3 in a long time, on the PC. 

Anyhow I tried to find out why I was so jaded and I guess I just realized that games are big and fancy and cool now

I realized, mainly because of the whole soccer moms in the media thing it had surrounding it for a while. Though I got looking at the titles that have came out since and it really has a great selection of characters that I love, and totally abandoned.  

Anyways, Mario Kart, 2 controllers, 2 wheels, wii sports and sports resort in the mail. Also come Friday I will have a PS3 and about 15 games boxed up to send into Amazon.

I have a basic 3DS. A teal system from launch. It works great. I still love it. My eyes, but there are all kinds of cool colors and editions that I will never see here in the west. Sure, Reggie defended Nintendo's reasons for not bringing so many over, but... that doesn't help me as a gamer.

Or how about those Shonen Jump games.

I **WANT** to give Nintendo my money. I think a lot of us do.

We've seen lately that these massive companies will listen to gamers if there is continuous pressure. Look at how gamers have fought the Xbox One into a machine that honestly isn't nearly as terrible as it was going to be for the industry and for gamers
