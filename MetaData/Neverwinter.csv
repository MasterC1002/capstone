1367816342.0,1dry0g,Neverwinter's F2P Model: What you need to know.,Tadders,699,98,467,"Just like in any other F2P MMORPG

**1. Introduction**

There are three immediate currency types in Neverwinter: Gold, basic profession items, basic mounts, and basic companions. Astral Diamonds are obtained through special tasks such as special daily quests, skirmish events, invoking your deity, and the Leadership profession. It buys a wide variety items ranging from Identify Scrolls to rare companions to mid-level gear. It is also the only currency usable in the Auction House. Zen is obtained through paying money. It buys many luxuries that helps give paying players a better experience overall. It may also be traded for Astral Diamonds and vice versa. For simplicity's sake

**2. Mounts**

As a non-paying player of Neverwinter,000 Astral Diamonds and 110% for 2,064,000 Astral Diamonds. This is progressive so you must buy them in order.

If you decide to drop some Zen for some fancier mounts, and an epic 110% mount goes for 30-40 dollars. The more expensive mounts of their respective tier has a unique model, such as the Worg and the Howler.

**3. Inventory Space**

You get a free bag at approximately level 10 and 30. They are 18 and 12 slots respectively. There are no craftable bags. For a free player

A player starts out with 16 bank space. An extra 16 slots of bank space can be bought for 6 dollars.

**4. Companions**

Starting at level 16

Zen buys a couple of companions which have a completely unique aesthetic. 15 dollars nets you an animal of your choice which have a rank cap of 15. 20 dollars hires a friend which has a rank cap of 20. 30-35 dollars gets you an epic quality pet that has a rank cap of 30 and three unique skills.

**5. Professions**

In Neverwinter

In the Zen Shop, there are 1 Purple or Blue Asset, 2 Purple Blue or Green Asset, 1 blue or green Asset and 1 green Asset (for a total of 5 guaranteed Assets). Any player may make any item, but [paying customers will get an upwards of 20% stat increase on their crafted equipment.](http://i.imgur.com/2w42F1j.png)

**6. Character**

You can make up to 2 characters. Two additional character slots may be purchased for 5 dollars. You may also rename your character for 4 dollars.

Respeccing your skills costs 6 dollars. Respeccing your Feats costs Astral Diamonds determined by your current level.

**7. Runes**

If nothing else

Players are given the option to add additional stats/effects to their equipment in Neverwinter. These come in the forms of Runestones (pets) and Enchantments (Armor/Weapon). For pets, Utility, and Defense. A single Runestone/Enchantment provides different bonuses depending on which slot there are equipped to. These also have ranks and start from 1 and ends at 9. Four of the same kind may also fuse to move up a tier. The chance of success starts at 95% at rank 1 and 10% at rank 8. You will lose a single Runestone/Enchantment upon failure.

There are two ways to circumvent failure: Preservation Ward and Coalescent Ward. Preservation Wards cost 10 cents each and prevent the loss of materials upon failure. They are also only consumed upon failure. Coalescent Wards cost 10 dollars and guarantees success of fusion. [Both these wards may also be obtained on a weekly basis through Celestial Coins (the latter being rarer)](http://i.imgur.com/d4ptd4R.png). Now you may be wondering why there's a huge discrepancy between the two Wards. I was wondering for a while too until I stepped my foot into endgame and found out there was an entirely different type of Enchantments: The Armor/Weapon Enchantments.

Armor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. [However, the real kicker here is that these ""Lesser"" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost **160 dollars** and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these **can be used in PvP.**

**8. Conclusion**

Cryptic wasn't lying when they said this game was 100% F2P. I have done all content on a GF and a DC without fancy Enchantments or Scrolls of Mass Life. However, including the Gauntlgrym content they have yet to release. And while it is true that you can always buy Zen with Astral Diamonds, simply doing quests/professions/skirmishes is nowhere enough to realistically sustain yourself. I have tried and it is far too difficult to reach 24,000 rough astral diamonds on a daily basis. On Mindflayer, it currently costs 435,000 Astral Diamonds for 10 dollars worth of Zen. I'm sure the market will stabilize soon, but even then it will take non-paying players to take upwards of two weeks to upgrade a single Enchantment.

Any complaints/advice/death threats are welcome. Hope this helps.

Well on 20/05/13 (Aus format) I charged $200 because I was running low on some AD. After work I got home but it was getting late so I decided to open some keys to get enough bars for a twilight horse and also sell some greater bags on the AH. To my surprise people were offering A LOT of AD for these items all of a sudden but it was getting late

I was watching some streams on twitch and surfing the forums and saw posts saying people who got banned received an email about it. So I was certain everything was okay.. I tried logging on when servers were finally up. Guess what? 'Your account has been banned'.
I immediately went onto forums to find out what was going on and looked through Facebook. I saw a few posts by either mods or the admin saying that if you didn't receive an email about your ban

1368410882.0,1e7wtu,Tips from my journey to level 60,vampatori,238,33,76,"*Character*

* You can pick any name you like

* Your choice of god/city/etc. doesn't seem to matter.

* The 'rolled' stats are not random

* If you mouse over any stat in your character screen it'll give you all sorts of details about it

* You can pick a title by pressing the edit profile button on your character details window.  You earn titles by completeing achievements.

* Always make sure you have enough potions for an adventure.  Eventually you'll have loads from drops

* The first set of feats (on the left) you can invest in any way you want, to get a second tier feat in one branch you need to invest 5 points in that branch.  You can still invest in the other branches though, but you unlock their tiers separately.

* If you stand next to a camp fire for a few seconds or so you'll get two good buffs as well as healed.

* You get two character slots per account for free

* When *Control Wizards* get to level 10 you unlock the special power slot (TAB by default) which allows you to have one upgraded version of an encounter power

* You can drag powers from your power selection screen to your hotbar.  There is an 8 second cooldown

* If you die you become injured which slows you down and can weaken you

* Don't respec while levelling up

*Quests*

* You can access skirmishes

* You can also access the daily quests from the home page

* Lore that you find goes into your Journal (shortcut J)

* There are achievements in the middle tab of your journal

* If you feel you're over-levelled for an area you can go to Sergeant Knox in the Protectors Enclave to get the next quest line in the next area.

* Going into deep water will kill you instantly (beware in the lizard man area).

* Dungeons from the Mad Dragon onwards are generally much

* If you're on a quest to kill X of something (and you will be, particularly when they're struggling.

*Companions*

* You'll eventually get to buy a companion for 2G as part of a quest.  (Apparently you can get your first free

* To level extra companions hassle free

* Pick the companion that you think will best fit your playstyle.  For example

* Different companions are useful in different circumstances

* You can switch instantly

* In the last areas (level 58+) my man-at-arms was being put down way too quickly so swapped to a cleric and things went more smoothly.

*Mounts*

* You can buy a mount for 5G

* You can sell mounts in the auction house

* Standard mounts will increase your movement speed by 50%

* This isn't an open world like other MMO games

*Items*

* If you have two items that are the same but one is bound to you and the other is not

* Some items that say 'cannot sell' on them

* Skill kits are very useful

* There are three different levels of identification scroll needed to identify different level bands of gear (1-29, but when you're on the border you won't have enough of the higher tier ones.  You can buy them from the AD store (see below).

* You can access the AD store anywhere by going to your inventory

* You'll get another bag eventually (total of two additional)

* There is very little to spend gold on, and there are profession items to spend on now and again.  So there is no real need to skimp on potions or anything else you need.

* Your three hot-bar item slots (for potions

* You won't get any gear that looks different until level 20-25.

* 25 Power = 1 Damage

* Each AC on gear = 0.5% Damage reduction

* Save your AD

*Auction House/Mail*

* You can access the auction house to sell/buy from anywhere by pressing the hammer icon along the top

* The game is new so prices fluctuate wildly.

* Put a buy it now price on low level (&lt; 60) items

* Ultimately I stopped selling low level (&lt;60) gear

* You can end an auction you're running at any time and the item will go straight into your inventory (not through post).

* When you sell stacks you sell them as a stack

* If you think ""wow

* When you delete a mail message it will create duplicate entries for all your mail messages.  Deleting a message will delete it and its duplicate.  Because of this I've taken to going through all my mail to get all my cash/items

*Enchantments/Runes*

* If you double click a stack of 4 or more you get a fuse interface where you have a chance to combining four into 1 of the next rank up.

* Unless you're desperately struggling

* There is no point in collecting these early on to fuse

*Professions*

* Levelling these up is time-based

* Currently in the crafting professions you'll not get much other than under-clothes that are actually useful (all the gear is terrible).  Hopefully this will change in the future

* You can access this interface through a web browser: http://gateway.playneverwinter.com/

* Leadership is a good one to invest in early as it doesn't require any resources

* Skill kits are your best source of materials

* The profession item retailer in the market has two tabs, etc.

*Combat*

* Combat is skill based

* Always pull the boss out of the room they start in if possible

* Always focus on taking down the most annoying thing first

* Some areas will be filled with packs you find it hard to deal with, tactics, etc.  If you still can't do it, ask for help/come back later.

* You can just walk out of red markers if you do it quick enough to save stamina for when you really need it.

* Buff powers will turn off when you go between an instance and non-instance

* Powers that knock targets combined with large drops can be a very quick way of dealing with nasty enemies.

* Some monsters are immune to various forms of control and knockback.

* Pop one of every buff potion before going into a boss fight/tough encounter

*Misc*

* When you reach level 15 you can use the Foundry to create your own quests.  There is a button on the character selection screen.  There isn't much in the way of documentation / tutorials about this yet

**edit:** 5:10pm Pacific: twitter feed responding to tweets again

&gt;* Update 5:15 PM Pacific: We have most of the information in-hand, a full character wipe will not happen. We're doing everything we can to minimize the impact of this fix, so that it changes what must change, but not much else. Thank you all for your patience, we appreciate it and will have you back in-game as soon as possible.

 The above thanks to /u/Kaspanova

**edit:** 5:45pm Pacific. [From twitter](http://puu.sh/2X2rZ/fab1830efd.png) the implication here is that there is/are option(s) on the table that would involve some kind of roll back. Also it seems the downtime will continue for (what I assume means) at least an hour. [source](http://puu.sh/2X2w9/3dc70d4570.png)

&gt;* From Twitter 6:00pm Pacific. We're finalizing the plan

**edit:**  8:10pm Pacific [From Twitter](http://puu.sh/2X7iF/d01d75e986.png) 

 We should have a post on the plan within 30 minuets


&gt;* 8:27pm Pacific - Thanks for your support

&gt;* Update 9 PM Pacific: The post about our plan of action is being confirmed -- stay tuned

**edit:** 9:21pm Pacific: [from twitter](http://puu.sh/2X9pW/f65118e214.png) sarcasm aside this looks like a hard deadline on at least telling us whats going to happen.

From /u/postatyourownrisk  

[Bugs that were know

&gt;**1** - AH exploit - This is what all the current fuss is about. Too bad it was discovered and reported in closed beta, I noticed that a GM told me the ticket was lost and to resubmit it. I did and kept playing. The second ticket was closed and ""lost again"". So I gave up reporting it.

&gt;**2** - Quest sharing exploit - This allowed you to reach level 60 in about an hour of playing. It also allowed people to farm unlimited bags, but still made it in to the open beta. Once again, I made a ticket about it only to have it closed. My follow up ticket was also closed.

&gt;**3** - Foundry bugs - Were used to gain max level and farm gear. Although I knew about this bug

&gt;**4** - The CW set bonus bug allowing them to hit for millions points of damage. This was a very minor bug

&gt;**5** - The GF set bug - Yet another set bug that allowed the GF to almost instantly kill any mob in the game. A lot more consistent than the CW set bug

&gt;**6** - Chest farming exploits - These are still in the game and allow people to farm easy money

&gt;**7** - There is already a bot out for Neverwinter that members of Tault Unleashed have been using. Currently it can be made to level or exploit chests. They are working on having it take care of professions and auto pray for you as well.

&gt;**8** - TR DC bug - this was used mostly in PvP to instantly disconnect anyone the TR targeted with certain abilities. It allowed all TR groups to quickly win matches in the least amount of time possible.

&gt;**9** - Potion exploit - Basically you can have unlimited healing potions - not much of an exploit since you can accomplish the same thing easier by using any other AD earning exploit and buying potions.

&gt;**10** - AutoHotkey - Macro software that allows you to easily max your crafting.

&gt;**11** - AFK PvP groups - creating a few accounts and making an AFK group (managed by AutoHotkey or the Viper bot)

&gt;**12** - Their support site has not worked since launch. That's right

&gt;**13** - Dungeon exploits - There are plenty of ways to exploit dungeons to severely shorten the time required to beat them. Reaching the end boss can be cut down from 45+ minutes

&gt;**14** - Boss exploits - Easily kill dungeon bosses over and over for loot and seals

&gt;**15** - There is another armor set bug which gives everyone in the party stats that are above and beyond what you can get without cheating.

**edit**  from /u/tobascodagama concerning the fact that these bugs were known
&gt;  ""The best explanation is that those bugs were already in the bug tracker


**edit:** We are nearing an hour since the last PW update(not including responses to tweets) [I found this](http://puu.sh/2WYxn/7c004b981f.png) on thier official twitter feed [here](https://twitter.com/NeverwinterGame)

I was contemplating quite a bit on whether I should create this post

The method that I used was incredibly easy to spot, not a lot of people were actually using it. It involved weapon/armor enchantments and, in particular, fusing them and selling back on the AH.
See, and all subsequent tiers, enchantments were selling for.

So I spend maybe 4 hours yesterday doing this, spent some time sniping the coalescent ward for about 100k (once found it for 18k), fused them and got one lesser thunderhead enchantment. The lowest price on the AH for that item was 450k. The key to a successful sale was to substantially undercut it. So I listed it for 389,999 and it sold within an hour.
After the first successful sale I decided to do a bit more search on the AH

After that I decided to take it to the next level, I decided to make 2 lesser enchantments by crafting them and two more I will just buy (payed maybe around 90k AD more than the crafting cost for each). Total crafting cost for that item ended up being around 1.3m and I decided to sell it for 2.7m (at that time there were 4 items of this kind in total, cheapest one was listed for 3.9m or something like that). It was around 2am, so I decided to go to sleep. Next day I woke up and found 2.43m in my mail (mind the AH tax ~ 12%).

After checking the prices for shards/wards/enchantments today it became pretty obvious that the arbitrage is still there, some remained the same). Felt pretty good to have that amount in my bank, but I didn't feel like keep going after that, since I was already fully geared (GS 9.5k) and accumulating as much AD as possible to be able to purchase better gear later on was not my goal (told myself I'd never do that again after D3). So I thought I'd share it with you guys, hopefully people found this post interesting, despite the length. All in all, the key to success is observation and understanding the majority of your market (approximate wealth, likeliness of making inefficient decisions

On a side note, I was fully aware of all the risks and knew that the items might not sell and I might end up losing a significant portion of my AD. 

TL;DR more than tripled my AD in one day selling enchantments.

1364246974.0,1azz51,Tips on how to play NwO for free free (based on beta w/e 3).,reeight,83,8,47,"#### 1: Have self-restraint

Don't identify every magic item you find; ID only the ones that will be an upgrade for your character.  You will have enough extra scrolls to barter with ;).

Save healing potions for boss fights &amp; dire emergencies.  See surviving tips below.  Dieing &amp; resetting back to spawn point in levels lower than 20 is no big deal either.

Save all your money &amp; spend only on things in this order: mount, then keep 7+ of the 4 kits on you at all times, &amp; use them liberally.  Rarely should you need to spend gold for anything else.

Save your kits to open stuff until level 20 when you start getting decent enchantments.

#### 2: Be smart about how you play

Engage in fights smartly; pull/rush/sneak, then engage.

Be smart about dealing with groups of mobs; focus on killing 1 at a time (even if using AoE) &amp; keep the rest CC'd &amp; away from you.

Find out what sequence of castings work best for the mobs you're playing &amp; your style.  There is a spell rotation that works best for your class; find it &amp; use it.

Find a cool player to party with.  &amp; be nice &amp; helpful on how you play.

Don't complain how NwO is Pay2Win

#### 3: Maximize on how you use your gear.

Keep empty spaces in your bag; trade with party mates liberally, &amp; bank when getting full.

Right click over all your gear to find out what you can do to it.

IMHO using level 1 enchantments are a waste; combine 4 into the next level &amp; use the highest level that you can.

Rotate your companions.

Hit difficult dungeons or use your coins when your gear is starting to look weak.

#### 4: Have different expectations

Always-full health bars might be in other games

Don't expect clerics to be the one to keep you alive.  No matter your class

 * Avoid damage (jump off red circles, CC...)
 * Play with a party.  ++ if using voice chat ([v]
 * Cleric NPC companion (she's a permanent Heal Over Time
 * LifeSteal stat (from equipment; good health regain IF you have good DPS)
 * regeneration stat (from equipment; slow trickle of out-of combat health; helps keep you topped off)
 * Higher AC/damage reduction stats &amp; abilities 
 * Drop a healing altar (between permanent altars
 * Healing potions (use emergency-only &amp; you'll have enough)

Mouse targeting is different from [Tab]-targeting.  More fluid

This is a free2play game, monsters, maps, etc at launch.   More may come in time if people will spend money &amp; turn NwO a profit.  Advantage is you can choose time or money on how you buy your fun.

Here goes:


**Background**

There are two types of enchantments in the game at level 60. First of all there are the enchantments you get while leveling and that you can put into items from around level 20-30. Second a special type of enchant that comes in two flavors: Armor and Weapon. These can only be inserted into certain level 60 epic items. The thing about enchants is that they improve your stats greatly

*Example*

As an example I will take the two chest pieces for Control Wizards (Since that's what I play) that are bought with seals. Looking at each stat's improvement between the two armor pieces you will see that they are roughly 10%-20% for the stats that matter. Picking Recovery as a sample stat, I picked it since it's a major source of stats). A Rank 4 enchantment gives 90 Recovery whereas the Rank 5 gives 120, an improvement of roughly 30% and this is not even taking the higher ranks into consideration. And if you compare it to the item, a Rank 5 enchantment gives you about 50% of what the T1 armor gives.

The point of this example was to prove that enchantments are a big deal


**Enchantments (Colored offense/defense/utility)**

As mentioned previously
You can merge 4 of the same rank to get 1 of a higher rank

4x Rank 1 = 1x Rank 2

4x Rank 2 = 1x Rank 3 = 16x Rank 1

etc...

In total there are ~~7 ranks~~ 9 ranks (Corrected by *beanso* and also [proof](http://i.imgur.com/dPPUv0i.jpg?1)), starting at 95% from Rank 1 -&gt; Rank 2, going down to 90%, then 85%, then 60% and then even lower. So statistically it will take a lot more of these to get to Rank 9. However there exists an item in the Zen shop for 1000 zen (Roughly $10) which guarantees success. This item is also buyable with Astral Diamonds at rather affordable prices on auctions.


**Weapon and armor enchantments**

These enchantments are another story. First of all their source, hence requiring a roll if dropped from a boss. The second big difference is how they are created, the drops in instances are shards, useless on their own, which can be merged to a ""Lesser"" version of the enchant. These can then be merged to a ""Normal"" and then a ""Greater"" like so:

4x Shards = 1x Lesser

4x Lesser = 1x Normal = 16x Shards

4x Normal = 1x Greater = 64x Shards

In other words it takes you at least 64 shards to get a single Greater. It does however not end here, and wards aren't the big deal.~~ (See edit about wards)

*Warning: Math and statistics ahead!*

Now, apparently it only goes up to around 63% ([Explaination](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1ebh17/details_of_the_possible_pay_2_win_aspects_no/c9yp1iz)) Admittedly, for each fail you only lose 1 of them which makes the exact calculation more complex and I feel the risk of me borking it up is too large, please comment away if you can do it and I'll put it up here with credits. :)
Either way


**Conclusion**

~~The problem isn't in the wards. Let me rephrase that: Wards aren't that expensive, you actually need 21 wards to make a Greater Enchantment, I retract this statement. Wards are also a part of the problem.

The major issue is the source of shards, you have too look that up, so statistically you get 1 every 2 dungeons at best. Then there are 13 different kinds so the chance of you getting the one you actually want is kind of small. All in all, we're talking about years of farming if you don't want to spend cash at all and even if you elect to spend some (For wards) it's still a long way to go.

Now the obvious counter-argument here is that you can buy this stuff on AH. Let's have a look at some prices at the time of writing. Vorpal weapon enchantment is the one most (All?) DPS classes should want, they are percentage points ([Explanation of the difference](http://www.mathsisfun.com/percentage-points.html)), this may of course be completely false but either way it's a big improvement.
A shard costs 50-70K AD. Let's pretend that there are enough shards at 50K to make a Greater enchant (There isn't). That's a total of 3.2 million AD for the shards. Then you need wards as well, equaling an additional 3.15 millions) All in all that is ~~3.8 million~~ 6.35 million Astral Diamonds *at best*. Then of course you have to pay that again each time new content comes out because you will most likely get an improved weapon.

For the sake of full disclosure I have some points about this:

* The price I used in my calculation is unrealistically low at the moment

* The Vorpal enchantment is the most expensive of all enchantments (Probably because it's the one that's in highest demand)

* All prices can go anywhere

Although it's pretty clear that getting your hands on this stuff is unlikely unless you

* A: Pay for it

* B: Exploit

* C: Are very lucky and find rare loot that sells for a lot


**Full disclosure**

As might be appropriate

* I play CW

* I am level 60

* I've played several other MMOs including a metric tone of WoW (Vanilla

* I have not invested any money into this game yet (Waiting for thing to stabilize and for me to decide if I want to play or not)

* I don't like how the system is set up at the moment

* So far this game has been fantastic gameplay-wise and the dungeons are somewhat challenging and a lot of fun

* I do not, hate this game. Nor do I hate anyone here, even if you disagree with me, nor do I want it to shut down, fail or anything similar. I simply think this part of the business model is skewed *at the moment*. Note the italics, this might all change in a week, prices can go down and it won't be an issue any more.

* I am 100% OK with companies charging players for accelerating your progress in a game but the acceleration should be reasonable

* I am 110% OK with companies charging players for vanity items

* I picked a few facts and stats from [a thread about enchantments](http://nw-forum.perfectworld.com/showthread.php?193232-Epic-Armor-amp-Weapon-Enchantments)

* I do not have a cat (Neither in-game nor IRL)

If you feel this section is missing something


**TL;DR**

Basically, this means 21 wards at a total cost of approx. 3 million AD. In total 6 million AD if you want to buy them (Probably takes 6-12 months of farming) or 3 million AD for the wards if you want to farm the shards yourself. Note that this is only for one slot, if you want an enchantment in both your armor and weapon slot you have to do everything all over again.

In terms of $$$ 6 million AD is around $200 (300 AD/Zen on Dragon ATM

While there are a few additional ways to get these wards

I do not expect everyone to agree with me on this

**EDIT**: To put it plain and simple

**EDIT 2:** As pointed out by *Krazed59* I was wrong when counting that you needed only 4 wards (Should have been 3 with my logic but that's beside the point). You actually need 21 wards for a fully upgraded enchant and that's a lot of money at $10 each if you want to buy them. I have updated my calculations accordingly.

**EDIT 3:** A point was brought up about how much time it would actually take to farm this. I wrote up a quick example but it has a flaw. I don't know the actual drop rate for Vorpals

&gt; ~~From what I reckon, which everyone will most likely need on. Since there are 13 enchants that's 1/13 chance of getting the right drop (Provided they all drop at the same rate in all dungeons) and then an additional 1/5 chance of actually getting to loot it. That's about 1.5% chance per dungeon run, round that a bit and you get 100 runs per shard. Multiply with 64 and you get 6400 runs.

&gt; Not quite sure about how many runs per day are reasonable but let's take a really hard core example. You do dungeons at 30 mins/dungeon (Quite fast from what my impression of T2 is) and grind 8 hours a day

&gt; Of course there is the possibility that certain dungeons only drop certain shards which means you can farm a specific one. Then you can do runs with guildies, we're talking a year or two.

**EDIT 4:** A counter-argument was made about the wards by Muscly_Geek that you can actually get wards from the 7 Celestial Coin reward. While it is true that I completely overlooked this

You still need 21 wards. At 1 ward/week (Which you won't get since it only ""often times contains a ward"") it will still take you 21 weeks or about 5 months to get that. Provided you can log in every single day because if you miss one your coins disappear.

While it does decrease the cost to some extent

An additional point about this was made that you can just create a bunch of accounts and farm prayers to increase your chance of getting wards. While this is true

-----

###**I. Introduction**

[Neverwinter](http://nw.perfectworld.com/) is a free-to-play fantasy MMO based in Faerûn

It's put out by Perfect World, shop where you can buy things for your character, both useful and cosmetic.

&gt;So does free-to-play = pay-to-win?

No. There are items in the Zen shop which greatly impact your character (bigger bags, they just help you along.

If you feel these items are necessary you're still not forced to pay. The game features an exchange allowing players to buy Zen for Astral Diamonds

###**II. Creating Your Character**

Download the game and watch the cut scene. Be sure to watch the cut scene. You'll see a little bit of the playstyle of every class and so it can help you choose what you'd like to be. Here's the class run-down:

*Guardian Fighter (Tank)* - Sword and shield wielding tank.They don't do tons of damage solo, but you'll still be able to solo with the Guardian Fighter, you just may not feel as powerful.

*Trickster Rogue (Melee DPS)* - Standard rogue. All about DPS and being stealthy.

*Control Wizard (Ranged DPS/CC)* - Decent DPS and a lot of control

*Devoted Cleric (Healer

*Great Weapon Fighter (Melee DPS)* - Less stealth and more big swords than the Trickster rogue.

**What race should I pick?**

Any race can be any class. Remember you'll be staring at this character all the time so I recommend picking something you like the look of. Races have racial bonuses but none are game-breaking enough to choose one race over the other.

It's asking me to fill in a background and deity?
From a gameplay perspective these don't matter. These are for us RPers who want to think of our character as more than pixels. Read up a bit

###**III. Playing the Game**

The opening quest lines give a good introduction to the way the game handles and so I won't go too much into every little bit of things

**The UI**

There are two modes for the UI. They're called Mouse-Look Mode, which will allow you to use the cursor and click things. You switch between them with the Alt key.

http://i.imgur.com/JGy4gzQ.jpg

These different abilities will be introduced to you as you gain them through questing

###IV. The Noob's Guide to Starting Out

***I just started
&gt;Play through the quests. They'll acquaint you with the basics and eventually lead you to town.

***I just reached town for the first time
&gt;Continue along your quest lines to find the next areas to level. 

&gt;Visit vendors in the Market to sell any junk in your bags. 

&gt;Collect your welcome kit from the mailbox. 

&gt;Store any items you want to keep but don't need to use (like your welcome kit) in the bank.

&gt;http://i.imgur.com/Vrb0bDZ.jpg

&gt;You should now also be eligible to play Foundry quests. Foundry quests are player-created content that you can play instead of the default quest lines. Access them by pressing H

***I just hit level 10-11
&gt;It's time to start Invocations and Professions.

&gt;**Professions start at 10:** See section V below.

&gt;**Invocation starts at 11:** Once an hour you can Invoke at a Campfire. Stand at the Campfire and press Ctrl+I. You will get a temporary buff and possibly currency, which can later be traded for gear, mounts, and companions. 
 


***I just hit level 16
&gt;You will have a quest to gain a Companion. Companions will help you in battle so you want to do this quest as soon as you can.  You can choose Man at Arms, or Dog. 

&gt;Non-tank classes will probably want to choose Man at Arms as it functions as a pocket-Tank for you. Warrior classes will like the Cleric Disciple to be their pocket healer. The Wizard deals good AoE damage and the Dog deals good single-target damage.

***I just hit level 20
&gt;This is when you unlock your first mount. It may be too expensive now (5g) but you will be granted 3 free tokens to get temporary five hour mounts to help you in farming up the rest of the gold you need. You get these tokens in your blue Level Up Box. Alternatively you can sell items on the auction house for Astral Diamonds and use those diamonds to buy a mount from another player via the Auction House.

###V. Professions
Every character has access to every profession. Unlike WoW you will not choose just a few out of a list. However you do have a choice of what you focus on.

&gt;Leadership: Grants experience

&gt;Mailsmithing: Creates armor for Clerics and Great Weapon Fighters.

&gt;Platesmithing: Creates armor used for Guardian Fighters.

&gt;Leatherworking: Creates armor for Trickster Rogues.

&gt;Tailoring: Creates armor for Control Mages.

I chose Leadership because the experience it grants will help when leveling my character. You may wish to choose whatever crafts items for your class. Eventually you can have everything

Every class has a gathering ""skill"" associated. This means they can use the nodes without kits. So as a Cleric I can gather any Religion node without needing any supplies. Anyone can gather any node but for non-class nodes you need the right kit. All of my expenditures so far have been kits to gather nodes, so no nodes go to waste.

You open your Professions tab by pressing N. Every player can use/max every profession

http://i.imgur.com/Y5XdAwO.png

Your first move when getting started with Professions will be to hire an Asset. Think of these as workers or specialists for that profession. This is a fast task

http://i.imgur.com/ZMR8Xru.png

When you click on the profession, so if you know you're going to be playing for a few hours you may want to do a 2 hour task, but if you're going to sleep maybe choose a 6+ hour task.

Doing a task will reward Profession Experience and possibly other rewards. As you gain more profession experience that profession will level and you'll have access to a wider variety of jobs.

As you unlock more Profession Slots you can have multiple professions working on jobs at once or you can focus all of your slots on one profession,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368491763.0,,cleric,t3_1e42r7

I just wanted to post here on my thoughts so everyone could get an idea of what I'm going through and my experiences with the game.

* 1st, it lives up to it's name.  I control fights whenever they happen, I only get into trouble when I have 10+ guys on me.  I also have stunlock capabilities, and CCs overlap with each other with ease, making any unlucky recipient unable to react to what you are doing for a good ten seconds at least.  I'm saying, if they were spam mashing a cooldown to catch me while coming out of CC, they still wouldn't be able to do anything.  The CCs overlap, you get what I'm saying?

* Combat gets crazy fun after 30.  In the beginning, it feels good, you like it, first impressions and all.  But when you get into dungeons or some of these foundry missions, sometimes it's very hard to keep track of what's going on, and you feel way more in control of those situations.  In wow, if you get mobbed by a horde of enemies, well I'm fucked.  Cya.  With this game

* The dungeons are fun.  I'm not spoiling anything about them.  There are cool basic mechanics to them

* You don't need money to excel at the game.  Meaning you don't need cash money

* Start professons early

* Get all three types of companions, Tank

* The zones are beautiful, but I die a lot less than my friends.  However, my rogue friend who started on Saturday is already 40.  Rogues can solo high high level content and level very quickly.

* The community is awesome.  I haven't ran into a dick yet, stuff like that.

* In groups, GREED, IF IT'S GREY, NEED.

* Quest Turn ins give exp to companions.  Companions can wear equipment.

* In your character screen

* Purchased items from the zen store can be sold on the AH

* The answer to the riddle in the clock tower is Twelve

* I've only been beaten in damage once, but rogues are the kings of damage.

* Contrary to popular belief

* Foundry missions can be a good way of leveling.  On the minimap

1368433764.0,1e8ghf,Guardian Fighter Threat Generation Guide,PostingUnderDuress,68,13,40,"So

This was the case in Beta Weekend 3 but has since been fixed. If you want to see Clerics in a truly broken state

Anyway, so I thought I'd write a basic guide, as I think the people who think the situation is broken are missing the fundamentals of tanking in Neverwinter.

In my opinion, which is more than I can say for the situation in BW3. The only problem that Guardian Fighters have now is the Cleric shields being so powerful that they're rendering tanks superfluous. But this is easy to fix.

I've been 60 for about a week and a half

First of all, in for example, WoW, which uses a static model, you can build threat and it will never decay (outside of being victim to ""buffet"" abilities), and so if you build a large enough lead, you can literally stop, you will never lose aggro. In Neverwinter, if you walk away

Your single, the little lungey poke thing you do over the shield. This is the bread and butter ability for holding threat on a single target. However, if you can arrange more than one mob to be in front of you, you can hold threat on all of them, as the ability appears to hit anyone in a narrow cone in front of you. I've been able to hold fairly solid threat on around 5 mobs using this. Your main problem with doing this is your guard breaking from all the damage, rather than the ability itself.

Generally

Make sure you take Enhanced Mark

Max out the Potent Challenge feat.

Take Threatening Rush as your first At-Will (and Tide of Iron as the other). It will mark targets like there's no tomorrow. Generally, and shift yourself so mobs are positioned where AS can hit more than one.

Taking Iron Warrior will help with keeping your guard meter full. Pop it when you're about to take a hard hit through your guard. Remember, as you can't use AS without it.

By far, although these are linked via your guard meter. Because of this, as tanks, we'll never be able to tank everything at once, but that's why we have control wizards. Some responsibility for add control falls to your DPS and control classes. GFs are not a magic bullet for all mob control, but we can do a lot of it.

Just a quick meta post about /r/Neverwinter. As we are rapidly approaching 5000 subscribers (sorry

* On the first 4 days of May we've already had more Unique Visitors and Pageview on the Subreddit than we had in **all of April**.
* This is even more impressive considering that April was already a record month. It had more Uniques and Pageviews **than ALL previous months combined**.
* We were at less than 2000 Dragon Slayers only a couple of weeks ago.

It's save to say then that Neverwinter is very hot right now and we are happy to see that so many of you have recently found this Subreddit!

But all of that is just numbers. What really matters is that with this sudden rise in attention the Subreddit hasn't lost its 'ways'. The community here is friendly and helpful and the active mods (Pretty much just [Lawlta](http://www.reddit.com/user/Lawlta) and [SkumbagAce](http://www.reddit.com/user/SkumbagAce) at the moment) are doing an amazing job!

Smaller packs I couldn't care less but with 3+ ""medium"" mobs it can become a mess. Have you seen what happens when you charge in, position the mobs and build some initial aggro. 

2. **STOP THE KNOCKBACKS** - Seriously nothing is more infuriating than having the mobs nicely gathered and ready to blow a big AoE taunt just to see every mob being blown away in every direction. Well

3. **NEXT MAN-AT-ARMS I SEE I WILL KILL** - Get another companion. You may think an extra meatshield may be useful but really it isn't. What he does is taunting mobs away from the tank so once again the tank have to play catch them all. And having a harder time to build aggro. Now guess the rest. Also these companions turn big mobs so they toss their big AoEs in the direction of you. Or make them cleave you. Do you want to be cleaved? 

4. **When you get aggro, if I have mobs on me I am reluctant to charge through the whole group to peel one off you. Not only do I risk loosing more mobs than I gain but they will do collateral damage while going through the group. So go to the tank. ",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,guard,

* When choosing you character's 'home city' in char creation
 
* When choosing your Religion
 
* Choose your Companion carefully (available from about lvl 16 onwards) as after the first fre one they're quite expensive. From what I've read the Cleric Disciple is best for most classes when soloing.
 
* Don't worry too much about where to sink Feats and Power points. I had about 5 of each saved up at one point while still deliberating how to spend them
 
* If you want to ever level up Professions much, despite only starting to do this about level 15.
 

That's it so far. As I said I've only played up to 18 so have barely scraped the surface. It's a fun game but a lot needs to change during the Beta -- but that's the whole point right?
 
Anyone have any insights from higher levels? Tips about certain classes/ builds? Would love to get some proper spec theorycrafting going on here!

* normally groups for Dungeon delves are formed up to an hour before delves. Groups will then Pre-clear the dungeon and then relog before the first boss. This allows multiple clears

* MAKE FRIENDS! Jump on the guilds Voip server and start talking to people. Someone doing some pvp? Ask to join them. Someone leveling an alt around the same level as one of yours? Ask to join them. Most people play MMO's because they want interaction with people

* On the topic of making friends

The DC has to make a painful moral decision on who to support/save, enemy aggro and red AOE is everywhere  and it just leads to everyone being scattered, finger pointing (often at the cleric), everyone taking more unnecessary damage and being overall less effective.

**The Ideal case:**
What you want for boss/dungeon fights is to have a solid frontline and a backline.  The party is hopefully positioned in advantageous terrain (eg on a bridge if tossing, CWs can cluster everything there to be mowed down with AOE or control them while priority targets are dealt with. There is **focused fire** so stuff dies fast and early, and the DC can support everyone with AS/ healing.  There should be just one frontline.  If adds break for DC/CW everyone else is close enough to the frontline to be dealt with.

**Let GF/GWF grab aggro before engaging:**
Always let the GF/GWF engage first with taunt etc to grab aggro.  They will then either proceed to tank at the mobs or drag them back at the party.  Once they have held their ground, otherwise the mobs will rush straight at you in the backline and create two fighting fronts.  The tanks will have to either tank the mobs and leave you on your own or try to peel off you and expose the rest of the party.  Not a pretty scenario in either case.

**When adds pile up- CW survival guide:**

If you have the inevitable add train on you

+ **Don’t stand in red** circles at all

+ **Use potions to counter spike damage**.  Post patch your aggro is like nothing it used to be.  If you don’t heal yourself up between fights via potions/astral shield you’re going to be a liability.

+ **Dodge TOWARDS the cleric** or center of party instead of further back.  A good cleric will have his eyes on you and is ready to heal/clutch, they can handle a few more hits due to higher defense and they’ve dealt with adds from all their training.  

+ **Stay within astral shield**.  See that shiny blue circle on the ground that the cleric tries so hard to keep up?  That shield gives you a massive damage reduction and healing over time.  If necessary

+ **Don’t cast unless you can dodge**.  If stuff is in your face or right on your heels, cast, dodge out of red circles and keep running.

+ **Use GF/GWF and even DC as meatshields** between you and new adds.  When adds spawn (looking at you Spider temple blademasters) they often just charge the closest member or the DC with healing aggro.  You want to position yourself physically such that the GF/GWF are closer to them when they spawn/charge.  They can take the hit

Hopefully that helps everyone have a better time in dungeons and boss fights.  Feel free to post your class tips also!

Edit: Just for people saying it's a sham spending $6 for a respec

You can earn EVERYTHING for free by simply farming,000 but my word all you had to do for what was invest TIME. You have a respec. 

The difference is if you put money into the game (real money) you basically just speed time up that's all,000 AD convert it to 600 Zen and oh look a respec.

My suggestion is to remove it completely and instead change it to a 1/day or 2/day bonus chest that you get for running the dungeon regardless of what time it happens to be. 

This would encourage people to run dungeons more often as they would have a reason to run multiple a day instead of farming one during the DD timer.  They would want to get in their daily runs of each dungeon.

1) Raids or at least better boss mechanics.  It feels like every boss does the same thing: don't stand in red and have OT pick up adds when they spawn.  While at first this is fun

2) More classes.  Luckily here is something they will do so I'm not worried.

3) Balance. If you've played a GWF you know this needs to be done and soon.

4)Lower cost of needed items in zen market or subscription option.  6 dollars to respec is too much. Nuff said.  Also

5) Ranked PvP. Lets face it you all wanted to be 2200+ and go play WoW with 2 buddies in sanfransisco or something for like 200, but as a competition with points is better.

* Be careful when starting Duelist Flurry on mobs near cliffs.  The stabstabstabstabbleebleed portion of the skill follows mob displacement so every now and again you may find yourself sucked into a CW's Space Toilet or pushed off with the mobs as well.

About Cleric's life at 60. PVP is a ton of fun but CTs and TRs with proper enchantments just absolutely destroy me. I had a game today where we stacked 2 Astral Shields (-40% from incoming damage) and a rogue 1 shot me from 100% to 20% hp and quickly finished me off after that. I know they most likely are gonna tone down TRs and CTs later on with patches

PVE is fun, but most likely will also be fixed.

1369090036.0,1eq4ax,Guide to augment companions and why gearscore is NOT everything.,Reyals_eht,38,12,53,"Very simple

power is a supplemental rating that yields damage

critical rating levels off pretty harshly around 3400-3600

recovery levels of steeply as well

To begin lets compare the value of a rare (blue) to an epic(purple)

on average an epic ring, usually offense.

rare rings acquired via pvp yield values of 243 and 133 to 2 ratings, generally an offense slot. 

let's say a t2 armor set supplies you with 1270 power and critical, and 785 life steal. with a rank 7 lifesteal socketed in the chest piece

add in all your accessories and weapons and you may get values comparable to:
3126 power
2411 crit
2558 recovery
707 defense
and 1403 life steal
we want to reach thresholds for diminishing returns on critical and recovery

a cat supplies both of these stats by simply ranking up

at best you can find an epic ring with 175 crit and 2 other stats

meanwhile a rare ring ""ring of the executioner"" acquired from the first boss of caverns of karrundax in normal difficulty, and an offense slot that can provide an extra stats (185 for rank 7, 220 for rank 8, and ??? for rank 9) possible stats are power, crit, recovery, or armor pen


so we can get a bonus of either 399-462 + an enchantment
or very specific attributes of 310 and an enchantment.

an extra 150 points isn't going to benefit you much if you are already at the DR level for that rating

**Reasons to choose a specific augment pet over another:**

currently max rank is a factor

**offense slots VS defense slots (runestones)**
offense slots allow for the socketing of power crit recovery and armor pen.
a defense slot gives you the ability to slot an eldritch runestone

if you gear the companion with 1000 of one stat

**accessory slots VS offhand slots**
accessories are much easier to find with specific values of specific stat pairings. it's really a judgement call


gear score is half the battle

I hope this helps somebody at some point in their decisions with companions.


**Useful item names:**
lethal occult items are critical/recovery
occult ___ of respite as above with recovery primary
blessings
youth: regeneration
piercing: armor pen
berserker: crit/armor pen

executioner: several different items ranging from regeneration to a crit/recovery ring i mentioned

bleached bone belt 325 recovery and a defense slot

***Deep beneath the cavernous networks of the Underdark, with the help of Lolth, they use them to challenge initiates of the Drei’raeth order in hopes of weeding out the weak.  It’s been heard that the order has opened its caverns to all who dare, in hopes of hardening their training. And are offering rewards to any adventurer who is up for the challenge. To accept this challenge travel to the darkest depths of Faerûn, and slay the Demon Lord Adramalech and his cohort of minions!***

The player has to face three Chambers of Sin before facing Adramalech

* **Chamber of Lust - Cha'lice
* **Chamber of Gluttony - Mordekai &amp; Lokash
* **Chamber of Greed - Alabazz

Hello fellow Faerûnians (If that's what their called)! ***Dracarys Drei'raeth*** once again

 If you haven't found a guild home yet please join our channel /AllKarma and ask for an invite to our guild or our sister guild Amrak (Karma Spelled backwards) as we have hit the member cap of 500 in Karma.

So at this point I have posted three separate version of my Foundry quest “Drei’raeth Caverns”. I released v1.0, it wouldn't be what it is without you. 

**I know have over 230 reviews and well over 300 plays with a 4 star rating!**

I have now spent upwards of over 48 hours played time within the foundry alone making sure this quest is the best it can be.

For those who have completed my quest previously, and third release.  It is enthralled with a much more epic, fiery, demonic, “Diabloesque” feel to it. As *Diablo* was a big inspiration for the design.

I am getting close to submitting my quest to Cryptic to be featured but still have some work to do.  I have some amazing additions in mind but my next release will be my final release before submitting it to be featured by Cryptic.  I fell it is in its last stages of its development

**But I need your help!**


**The following major updates have been made since my v.2.5 release**:

* Drei'raeth Caverns now has 100% customized monsters/demons I have designed myself along with my own mob names and descriptions. (I wanted this quest to feel very unique!)
* Increased overall difficulty of the entire dungeon
* Increased difficulty of Alabazz and Cha'lice boss encounters
* Decreased (again) difficulty of Mordekai and Lokash
* Opened up Mordekai and Lokash boss room to allow for more space when fighting the two giants.
* Added more quest objectives and side tasks by adding objects to interact with.
* Additional ""Surprise"" encounters have been added to the quest.
* Varied boss abilities.  No longer do all bosses have the same abilities.  Each boss has unique abilities.
* Significantly increased the difficulty of Adramalech
* Added several sound overlays and special effects for boss encounters and added more appropriate music.
* Increased the level of detail and ambiance of every room throughout the Caverns to include fire
* Each section of the caverns is now ""color coded"" for each boss.  Cha'lice being purple, and Adramalech being Black and Red.  The details, fire, and special effects also mesh with this theme adding another level of detail and customization to the environment.
* Created Scripted boss encounters with dialogue and voice effects.
* Demons with Drei'raeth Caverns now speak to you while fighting
* Removed “visible” traps
* Edited Mismatched Mob names and titles and fixed skins/costumes of encounters that weren't correct.
* Added more of a variety of encounter types with different abilities instead of all encounters having skills of the ""Ashmadai""
* And much much more! 

**Some keynotes**:

* **Eligible for daily foundry quest**
* Quest has a **4 star** rating
* This quest IS **Soloable** BUT it is not easy for everyone.  I recommend bringing a friend if you’re not confident OR bringing plenty of potions and a cleric companion if you have one.  I solo it as a GWF with a Cleric Companion at level 40 but I do consume a lot of pots and die sometimes.
* Quest can be done as soon as you enter the protector’s enclave which is the first main city you get to at around level 4-5.
* Author has no influence over loot rewards whatsoever.
* ***Falling to your death due to mob knockback is no fault of the Author.  Please be aware of your surroundings and beware of cliff edges and lava pits.***
* You can access Drei’raeth Caverns from any gate and fast travel to it.  It is not a “zone” based quest.
* A true dungeon crawl feel! Inspired by action rpgs such as *Diablo.*

**OOC**: It is a gauntlet style quest approximately **20-30 min** long depending on how skilled you are. This was originally designed as a quick, and fun daily foundry quest that doesn’t require a player to click through 100 quest dialogues and read a novel just to complete the quest, it has since evolved into something a bit more challenging but still does not require the player to read a short story.  Simply get to the end and survive all three chambers of sin and you are rewarded. Nice for players who just want to lay the smack down on some demons and test builds. It has dense mob packs in a linear twisting cavern experience with soundtrack that is all custom built by me. It has three minor boss fights in between the maximum amount of monster encounters for a map in dense packs which makes for great AOE encounters.  You will also face a final main boss fight at the end that has three phases,one of which he re-incarnates all of the bosses within the map. Grind quality is pretty good though not as fast as others though far less boring, due to the four boss fights you will encounter. So far the overwhelming response from players has been that they loved it! I'm still looking for more reviews to add more content and tweak any bugs players point out! Try it out, and leave me your foundry and I will try yours in return!

**DIRECTIONS**: Search for ""Drei'raeth Caverns"" in the foundry in game by pressing ""K"" then navigating to the foundry. Foundry can be done as soon as you reach the Protectors Enclave at about level 5 because it requires you to access the city gate in order to fast travel. Also this quest is not based on an over-world map which means you can access it directly by traveling using the city gate instead of actually having to go to a zone in order to enter it.

***Message me at Dracarys Drei'raeth@ashenoak for any comments or questions or email me in game with suggestions!*** 

**EDIT**: Also I feel it is imperative that I remind you that there is an achievement for tipping the maximum amount after a foundry quest.  If you don't have it yet,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368454291.0,,gwf,t3_1e8rp7

The thing that keeps occurring to me, if you know what I mean. In the face of unfairness, do you walk away, do you shake your fist, or do you make what you can control/accomplish the measure by which you judge your own success, rather than dwelling on exploiters or the imperfections of the system?

There has been a wave of account hackings today me being one of them and  I wanted to bring up some glaring issues with PWI account security to hopefully save you guys the hassle of going through it.

- Account Guard is ineffective

- When a email change request is made the confirmation is then sent to the NEW email address and a notification is sent to the OLD email address telling you that your email has been changed. If this happens on the weekend you are then SOL.

(Hello

We have received a request from you to change your account's registered email address. A confirmation email has been sent to your new email address for verification.

If you did not request your email address to be changed

- PWI Customer support only operates M-F from 10am PST-7PM. If you are as unfortunate as me your account will get hacked on the weekend leaving you helpless until the following monday.

I was actually shocked at how easy it is to simply change the email address on an account without having the account holder provide some sort of verification. This is the first time i've had an account hacked in the 10+ years I have been playing MMO's. There are players that have reason to believe that Founders are being targeted seeing as they will have a much higher amount of AD or Zen than other users.

Crafting:

I was dissapointed in the crafting system in general, but its not time that you have to actually devote to crafting.  Also, some of the time requirements are crazy, it took 6 hours to crate a pair of leather shoes (lv 9 trickster rogue boots) - this was as a lv 2 leatherworker fyi.  Overall I think the crafting system needs work.  (I did like that you can do your crafting form the internet (https://gateway.playneverwinter.com) and thought that the website interface actually felt smoother than the in game tool for crafting.

Gateway:

The gateway program is awsome!  Being able to update your Auction House listings

Power Tree:

I'm of mixed feelings about the new leveling tree.  On the one hand, can't get until lv 25+ - can't remember exact level right now).

On the other hand, just to unlock powers that I wanted.

Level Speed:

It felt to me that they made the leveling in BW4 even faster than previous weekends.  My rogue is now lv 44, but I wasn't actually playing that entire time, I tested out crafting and searched all of the vendors for new gear and stuff, played the Auction House as well.  I think I spent a total of 7 hours leveling up, and made 10 levels this weekend - that seems quick to me, especially at the higher levels of the game.

Identify Scrolls:

In previous BW it cost 800 AD for an identify scroll.  They now have 3 different types of scrolls (lv 1-29, 45, 150 respectivily).  I sold a few items on the AH, and purchased 20 lv 1-59 ID scrolls for 900 AD.  I also found 18 during my travals while questing.  It was very reasonable to keep all of my gear that I found identified so I could sell in on the AH.

General Overview:

Overall I'm still a huge fan of Neverwinter, a great game that I'm looking forward to.  Also, the Gateway is awsome!",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1cd94c/overview_of_changes_from_previous_bw_to_bw4/
1364383095.0,1b3rhg,Why the Guardian Fighter tanking model probably needs work,PostingUnderDuress,25,3,21,"I played as a Guardian Fighter throughout the beta weekend

I've been playing MMO's since WoW European launch in 2005, along with a few encounters in each expansion (although I flirted with other classes over that time). I've also played my fair share of post-WoW MMOs, including SWToR, Guild Wars 2, and a bit of Tera.

First of all, so was naturally sceptical, as I think most veteran MMO players are of new MMOs, given the rate of failure of post-WoW efforts. However, I was very pleasantly surprised, had a blast the whole weekend, and very much enjoyed how tanking in Neverwinter felt.

However, as it's fairly obvious that it's broken. Despite the Cleric issues, I feel the Guardian tanking model has some flaws that need ironing out before final for the tanking, and instancing in general, to be less frustrating.

The main issue seems to be that Guardian Fighters rely too heavily on tricks to maintain aggro, at least where GFs are concerned. As soon as you stop guard-stabbing your primary target, it runs (usually for the Cleric at this point). It seems to be impossible to build any kind of threat lead at all, meaning any time spent off target at all will lead to an aggro loss.

This leads me to believe that the threat model in Neverwinter is possibly based on a dynamic threat table, there simply is no threat attached to GFs at all, merely threat tricks, such as taunts and marks. Either way, these threat systems lead to several issues which will inevitably make encounter design less interesting, or otherwise frustrating to all involved. What follows are a few reasons why this way of modelling threat isn't as interesting as a static model.

- The tank must stay on the main target at all times. This means that there can't be any mechanics that involve the tank avoiding obstacles or moving too much
- The DPS has to throttle too much. A little throttling is fine

- The dynamic threat model completely breaks multi-target tanking. Because the tank must keep his TPS maxxed on one target at all times, will be being chased unless the DPS can manage the off-targets, which consequently means that the DPS will be taking aggro themselves.

- Tank kiting can't be done. Anyone remember AQ20 from WoW? Ossirian the Unscarred was the final boss of this instance. It remains one of my favourites. The main mechanic was that the tank had to gain and maintain aggro on the boss and then kite him to various points on the map, as the threat on the tank is too unstable to properly kite.

I understand that Cryptic may have gone this way with the design to make tanking more challenging, which I feel was where tanking was most enjoyable. However, I still feel that using a static threat model, but tweaking numbers so maintaining aggro remains challenging, will be better for the game and encounter design in the long run.

Let me know what you all think. I'm interested to hear some counterpoint.",self,t5_2sn0p,False,,guard,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1b3rhg/why_the_guardian_fighter_tanking_model_probably/

My biggest worry was that you would have to do PvP to get into the dungeons. However it seems that during phase two you have two options. First option is queue up for the big PvP match. The second option is to stay in the zone and do tasks that will provide support like making the catapults for the PvP people.

To get into the dungeon it looks like you will have to do participate in either phase 1 or phase 2 which will give you a ""share"". Which side you are on will determine whether you can go into the tier 2 dungeon or not but everyone can go into the tier 1 dungeon.

1363003311.0,1a2swi,Short Unbiased Review from New Player,jgortner,26,3,44,"Redditophies

It is without any bias or preconception that I bring you a short review from Neverwinter.  I would consider myself your typical gamer (both tabletop and video) with your average MMO experienced (raided in WoW, Tera, tried GW2, etc).

**What I absolutely loved ...**

 * Lore - A veritable forest of lore hooks, lore items in the game, and even praying to your diety every hour for buffs and items. The game provides and immerses players in the lore of the game.

 * Combat - You non-movement non-keyboard hand stays on the mouse 100% of the time to aim. But this is not Tera and does not require perfect precision or power-gamer like twitchyness. Mouseover an enemy and press or hold a mouse button to fire. Once you start firing if you keep the mouse button held down you stay locked on that target. This and other things make the combat viceral and just plain fun as you throw spells (or melee) at your target.

**What I really liked ...**

 * Game Style - This game does not feel 100% like your typical MMORPG. They have made the feel more like a D&amp;D campaign you are on. At least at this stage there is not as much open and persistent world questing (it is about 50/50 where most MMOs are 90%+ in the persistent world). I thought I would hate this but it really makes the came feel more D&amp;D like. And being 50/50 you do still have quests in the public domain you just have private quests in the sewers or otherwise that are instanced. But honestly I think this (and other things) gives the game the D&amp;D feel.

 * Character and Development - Whether you like D&amp;D or not the character sheet is just awesome. Your stats

 * Power set - Players pick 2 at wills, and the spell animations kick ASS!

 * Immersive Elements - Lots of immersive elements that really pull the game together! From running into traps during quests and dungeons, character driven, immersive experience, you'll love it.

**What I felt lackluster about ...**

 * Graphics and Voice Acting - These things do not have a big imact on game play but are present in the game and deserve reviewing. In these two arenas Neverwinter does not feel like a current generation MMORPG. Guild Wars 2 and Star Wars do a much better job here. Neverwinter character lip syncing is just OK and the graphics feel like they are from the previous generation of games. However both are still good enough for perfectly good immersion and game play.

 * Beta Qwerks - Overall the beta was very smooth. Nothing big to hum-and-haw about. However there were a couple annoyances; not being able to change zones unless everyone in your party was trying to zone and loot distribution (like chests) were a bit lacking.


Well that was supposed to be short!


**TL;DR**

LOVE

 * Superb and immersive lore
 * Perfect and fun action based but not twitchy combat

LIKE (really liked)

 * Game style and feel (it feels like D&amp;D
 * Character development (stats, oh my)
 * Power set (2 dailies
 * Traps

LACKLUSTER

 * Graphics and voice acting
 * Some small beta qwerks like zoning and loot distribution

Hey there! Dracarys Drei'raeth again

Since the first announcement of my Foundry quest “Drei’raeth Caverns”

For those who have completed my quest previously, fiery, demonic, “Diabloesque” feel to it. As Diablo was a big inspiration for the design.

I am getting close to submitting my quest to Cryptic to be featured but still have a lot of work to do.  


**But I need your help!**


**The following major updates have been made since my 1.0 and 2.0 release**:

(I have gotten several reviews that the quest was “Too Easy” yet I have also gotten reviews that it was “Far too difficult to solo”.  In order to accommodate everyone I have made the following changes.  Please realize the difficulty of a quest dramatically scales at different levels.  What may be extremely easy for a level 10 player

* Increased overall difficulty of the entire dungeon
* Decreased the physical length of the Caverns layout by almost 50%
* Decreased difficulty of Mordekai and Lokash
* Increased the Physical Size of the Succubus Cha’lice
* Increased the Physical Size of several other “standard” encounters to add a more epic experience
* Increased difficulty of Alabazz
* Significantly increased the difficulty of Adramalech
* Spent over 24 hours customizing nearly every single monster in the map. (I wanted this quest to feel very unique!)
* Added several sound overlays and special effects for boss encounters
* Increased the level of detail and ambiance of every room throughout the Caverns
* Created Scripted boss encounters with dialogue and voice effects
* Removed “visible” traps
* Edited Mismatched Mob names and titles
* Added more of a variety of encounter types with different abilities
* And much much more!

For those who haven’t done my quest yet here is some background on it for those interested! I'd like to make this the best experience possible for players

**Some keynotes**:

* **Eligible for daily foundry quest**
* Quest has a **4 star** rating based on 115 reviews as of today
* This quest IS **Soloable** BUT it is not easy for everyone.  I recommend bringing a friend if you’re not confident OR bringing plenty of potions and a cleric companion if you have one.  I solo it as a GWF with a Cleric Companion at level 33.
* Quest can be done as soon as you enter the protector’s enclave which is the first main city you get to at around level 4-5.
* Author has no influence over loot rewards whatsoever.
* ***Falling to your death due to mob knockback is no fault of the Author.  Please be aware of your surroundings and beware of cliff edges and lava pits.***
* You can access Drei’raeth Caverns from any gate and fast travel to it.  It is not a “zone” based quest.
* A true dungeon crawl feel! Inspired by action rpgs such as *Diablo.*

**OOC**: It is a gauntlet style quest approximately **20-30 min** long depending on how skilled you are. There is no real questing/story to it so far just some background lore but I’m up for ideas. This was originally designed as a quick, and fun daily foundry quest that doesn’t require a player to click through 100 quest dialogues and read a novel just to complete the quest.  Simply get to the end and survive all three chambers of sin and you are rewarded. Nice for players who just want to lay the smack down on some mobs and test builds. It has dense mob packs in a linear twisting cavern experience with soundtrack. It has three minor boss fights in between the maximum amount of monster encounters for a map in dense packs which makes for great AOE encounters.  You will also face a final main boss fight at the end. Grind quality is pretty good though not as fast as others though far less boring, due to the four boss fights you will encounter. So far users have loved it and I'm still looking for more reviews to add more content and tweak any bugs players point out! Try it out, and leave me your foundry and I will try yours in return!

The Drei'raeth of the Underdark are a notorious order of Drow Assassins. The Drei'raeth Caverns is the final training grounds for initiates in the order before being named an official Assassin of the Drei'raeth Order.

In hopes to improve their training

The player has to face three Chambers of Sin before facing Adramalech

* **Chamber of Lust - Cha'lice
* **Chamber of Gluttony - Mordekai &amp; Lokash
* **Chamber of Greed - Alabazz

DIRECTIONS: Search for ""Drei'raeth Caverns"" in the foundry in game by pressing ""K"" then navigating to the foundry. Foundry can be done as soon as you reach the Protectors Enclave at about level 5 because it requires you to access the city gate in order to fast travel. Also this quest is not based on an over-world map which means you can access it directly by traveling using the city gate instead of actually having to go to a zone in order to enter it.

Message me at Dracarys Drei'raeth@ashenoak for any comments or questions or email me in game with suggestions!

I always thought myself starting the guide with general 1-&gt;20 effiency guide

**Introduction: Leadership leveling**

The leadership is a profession for earning additional Gold, profession resources enchants or runestones. Leadership is the only profession that does not need any resources/assets that you cannot make or buy from the profession vendor. This is the most common (mistaken) reason why leveling leadership is so popular, but we will get to that later. 

It's largely known that leadership is the slowest profession to level. Given one mercenary and one slot doing the best task possible (Explore Local Area, chart the region and 100% bonus, totaling 660exp/h). That is more than 10 days of updating tasks every 30mins. To a quick comparison, even the slowest way (just gathering materials with one slot and one white dude) is only 2600h in any other profession. With fastest route (crafting armors) and 9 slots 9 grandmaster this can be as fast as 26h. 

**Comparison: Leadership rewards vs tailoring**

Now, that the more slots you have open, the more profitable other professions get. This comparison will be done with 3, 6 and 9 open slots, using best available assets. I will use tailoring as a comparison, to give leadership a change. let's pretend that you could buy 18 heroes at the same price as 9 grandmaster tailors (in reality, the difference is about 3 mil)

When using 3 slots, 10s and 120leadership experience for 4h. Since mining claims seem to go for 800ad in AH, assuming 3 slots, 6 heroes you would net 30s, 2160ad every 2h, thats 1080ad and 15s per hour (AH cut included). So how can we match this with tailoring? When writing this, a bolt of wool cloth costs 75ad on Beholder 150ad on Dragon (sorry no toon on Mindflayer, you will net 24 bolts of woolcloths and lose 7s30c in a hour. Even with 75ad per piece

Notable things, and you could easily get 100 per piece if you sell in nice quantities (I usually pay more so I don't need to open 100+ mails of single item). With 100ad per piece, you are looking at a whopping 2160ad per hour, double the rate of leadership. You also need lvl13 in leadership, but only 1 in tailoring. Not to mention the prices of assets. Also, tailoring will take only about 54minutes, not 1h to get to 24

So

Tailoring on the other hand does not suffer from the 3 task limit

Lastly, 200ad and 40 leadership exp in 2h. Assuming 3 slots, 6 heroes for this task you will net a whopping 600ad 3silver per hour, increasing the total to 2355ad/h 18s/h. Tailoring will grow like always, giving a nice 4860ad/h at 75ad/piece or 6480ad/h at 100ad/piece with loss of ~23s/h. 

**Conclusion on rewards**

So

If we assume 30 gold is worth one key, while tailoring will lose about half key in the same time. This adds 200ad/h to leadership (1280ad/h for 3slots) and subtract 100ad/h from tailoring (1520ad/h or 2060ad/h depending on price).

So the profits leveling don't cut the case for leadership, and even the cheapest task for the chest costs 10k in materials, so no, not worth it by a long shot. Unless leadership gets drastic changes, I don't suggest it unless you are 20 in all the other professions (at which point, money is no longer an issue).

**Afterword**

So quite long start to a series. Please comment and give suggestions what profession related stuff you would like to see next. Hope this helps any of you. If you know sites that collect guides and are you consider worthy

**TL:DR**

Ugh

I'm pretty new to the MMO scene and Neverwinter is the first MMO where I've almost reached the level cap. One thing I've noticed is that there seems to be a push for people to just move along the quest line without stopping to ""smell the roses"" as I like to call it. There are lots of cool places to visit and many amazing sights to be seen that just can't be seen if you are just power leveling. Maybe that's all you want though and I see no problem with that. I prefer to explore more than PvE or PvP, I keep my eyes out for locations to get a birds eye view from and a different angle than the scrying stones give me. 

If anyone has any questions

If there are any requests of areas you would like for me to try to take a nice screenshot of let me know and I'll try to find a way to do it. Remember that I'm not a GM so I'm still limited to the locations I can travel by jumping and dashing.

First off, and did some comparisons for the min/max values of my race (HOrc). My friend Aurorae went the extra step and compared bonus damage values for all possible stat combinations. (Also, I probably made a mistake somewhere. Please point it out to me. I'm sorry)

If the damage formula is additive
base * (1 + 1.04*str bonus + 1.2(CA bonus + CHA bonus))

and cha &gt; str due to the 1.04 ratio compared to the 1.2 ratio
Additive bonuses dont make much sense

however
base * (1 + 1.04*str bonus) * (1 + 1.2(CA bonus + CHA bonus))

its a whole different beast

Doing the math for my HOrc rogue's possible stats (max str/cha and str/ max cha, CHA = STR when CA = .08 (roughly).

If the base CA bonus = 0

Aurorae does an even better comparison [here](http://i.imgur.com/4F68lCG.png) showing the lvl 60 stats (assuming all level up points go into str/cha and you have the campfire buff) and the final damage multiplier in column AB with the max and min values labeled. Max points into Str/Cha *seems* like the best damage investment

In conclusion, but anyway). The difference is so minor most of the time that you will not notice.

The first screen you will encounter when creating your first character is the race selection screen.

When you've chosen your race you are presented with the character class screen. Here's a list of the classes and their ingame description.

The final screen is the overview screen where you can see all the choices you make and finally write down the name you wish to use for your character.

For example I currently have these two appearance changes:

* Two Handed Sword &gt; Two Handed Axe

* Necklace &gt; Cloak

Once you change an items appearance I have not yet found a way to revert that change.  It is permanent.  The item you used to change the appearance is also CONSUMED

What is also important to note is say I change a necklace/medallion to a cloak.  Then 5 levels later I find an upgrade and its another necklace but I want the appearance of the same cloak again.  You can use the same necklace you changed earlier to change the new necklace and it will use the appearance of the cloak.  

So whatever Item has the current appearance on it

1367744427.0,1dq3l8,AP / Divine power gain for Cleric powers,neverwintercake,20,2,16,"The vagueness of the tooltips was annoying me so much I decided to try and quantify divinity and AP gain a little. I sure hope it isn't some scheme to apply hidden nerfs without much of the player base noticing. 


I used a lv 17 cleric that was stripped naked (except for weapon) with the target dummy as my victim. I had no relevant divinity or AP gain talents besides 2/5 domain synergy(which is something really interesting, which makes me wonder if the whole talent itself is bugged or the character sheet is bugged. 
I only have access to a small selection of powers


AP gain:
lance = 1%

astral seal = ~1.66666666666.... %

searing light = 5%

blazing chains = 6%

sunburst = 5% X no. of targets hit (!!!)

divine pips had no effect on AP gain and I couldn't check healing word since you actually need to heal damage to get AP and divinity. Crit appears to have no effect on AP gain.

1 pip of Divinity is approximately equal to:

~ 15 lances of faith (~6.66666666... %)

~ 9 astral seals (~11.111..... %)

~ 3 searing light / sunburst (~33.333333.... %)

~ 2 blazing chains + 2 lances of faith (~43.3333... %)

I can't pass it on my own so I'd love to get some feedback from you. 

Search for the quest on the board in-game

You may have to click on the ""For Review"" tab to see Quests that have not yet been reviewed in order to play it.

It should be fairly difficult for a group of 5 level ~20 players and I hope you enjoy it.

**EDIT**: UPDATE - Thank you for the feedback. I have made the following changes - 

* Campfires added before and after difficult encounters.
* Music / FX added via triggers (Note music was already in each map but there is a bug that prevents it from playing
* Vayne disappearing / dying - This is a tricky one to solve but VERY important to me so I am working on it for this  quest and also the next installment.\

**UPDATE 2:** Added difficulty selection

i am a 60 GW leveling up was somewhat enjoyable pretty basic somewhat repetitive.

The biggest gripe with the game is EVERY boss / mini boss from ending quest/zone and Dungeon/epic dungeon is the same. 
1. Boss has some kind of AOE
2. Adds come in
3. repeat for 10-20min

I did 80% of the dungeons and its all the same i would've LOVED to see something different but it never happened it's SUPER boring.

i really hope they put some effort into making boss fights more interesting for the survival of the game. Take a note from Tera and Subtract 50-70% of the trash and give these bosses something interesting anything other then insert random aoe ability summon add.

hope to play this game in another month or two to see what happens GLHF!

2. If the rune looking thing is darkened and you can't click on it just go to a Travel Gate and travel to a different location and when you load in the ""Return to Instance"" button will be there.

I thought further about it though and came up with my new perspective which fixes everything(for me). This is all my opinion

Many MMO's are a lifestyle (WoW

1)  Like D&amp;D it's about grabbing some of your friends and playing through a new dungeon.  The foundry provides an endless amount of this.  D&amp;D is not necessarily geared towards 20 man raids
2)  Developing and balancing classes takes time and money -- I don't think NWO had that.  I don't see that they allocated their efforts elsewhere so I imagine they simply could not afford to put in the classes.  I believe this is why they will add more classes once they get some cash flow.  They developed a class for most types of players to start.
3)  Some classes are imba because they are trying to make fun classes.  The abilities for all the classes I've played feel impactful and satisfying.  I think the classes are tuned to be fun
4)  I think PvP is fun
5)  Lower graphics
6)  Respecs are pricey, IMO.
7)  There are P2W elements, you can enable the console and all the cheats in multiplayer mode.""  I wouldn't want to play with any of my friends if they were to enable cheats -- perhaps big-head mode and paintball mode (RIP Goldeneye).

I really agree with nearly all the criticisms as well as all the praise. I am just taking a different approach than many.  I am still playing GW2 for sPvP and world events -- it feels more like an MMO to me.  I am playing NWO when I feel like getting a dungeon run with some friends -- it feels mostly like a coop RPG to me.  I am playing LoL when I feel like getting flamed(hue).

1368715925.0,1egbqv,Tales of a GWF,hiimdave,23,7,51,"So it began, Ranged mobs (Tier 1 or Tier 2 mobs) were absolutely wrecking me

Leveling from 16-25 went without much effort, but that is another tale.  Around the level 30-35 range, I had picked up enough skills to deal high amounts of burst and was killing things at a good pace.  Granted around this level was when the AoE really took off and with Unstoppable + WMS, and zones were no riddled with weaker tier 1 mobs so the leveling rate increased drastically.  I feel the 30-55ish range is where GWF excels and those levels went by in a fun-filled blur of Takedowns, Restoring Strikes, Flourishes, Indom Battle Strikes

Sadly around this level is where things slow down DRASTICALLY.  Mobs live longer, and my gold was quickly depleting with how many pots I was forced to go through.  As I headed into the home stretch of 58-60 I pretty much had my end game build for both pve and pvp set up, feats were all in place, and I quickly was starting to realize how far apart I was from other classes in every aspect.  There is no doubt that TR is the higher dps class, or the GF has vastly better survivability, but I feel that GWF should have SOMETHING it excels at, and when I dinged 60 started pvp and soon found out even after full pvp gear and a variety of tactics to live / kill every class I came against

Another thing I will note is I dinged 60 with still level 34 items.  The RNG on identify gear / gear for quests sucking is just awful.  

We have to try so hard to kill anything and die easier than any other class on our gear level, mostly due to everyone forgetting they are there, or in pve mass AoE trash or waves of T1 mobs.  That being said the play style of the class feels great, so I do believe the class is worth playing but sadly the state of the game right now they are just far less valuable than say an extra TR or CW.
****
**TLDR**
  
* GWF Level 1-5: Same as Everyone

* GWF Level 6-15: Ranged mobs deal a lot of damage, pull slowly

* GWF Level 16-25: More pots, starting to see more damage

* GWF Level 26-35: Less pots than usual, seems to be a gear shortage
 
* GWF Level 35-55: Great AoE, still lack of gear, quick levels

* GWF Level 55-60: Utter hell, PvP really shows our lack of output / usefulness, PvE just as bad. 

****

**Improvements would be:**

* Either a buff to defense or damage, we are smack in the center with neither and it hurts...bad.

* Better gear choices/quest gear

* Small tuning buffs in the 16-25 / 55-60 range could make the leveling more enjoyable

* Reliance on potions far to heavy for this class


That is all I have for now, Cleric and GF while both fun just don't tickle my fancy.

**EDIT:  Thank you all for the replies and input

* Check AH/Vendors for gear responses - Some Servers AH's have not a lot of options, although I may have missed 1 or 2 items, but that didn't really matter once I got full epic PvP gear.  Even then the vast gap between classes is obvious.  

* Cleric Companion + def bonus runes - May have been something to check into, it may be vastly different with a level 30 companion than a 15.  

**EDIT 2:**  

* Seems that 90% of the comments are directed at bashing the fact I found no upgrades via AH or w/e...you may be right that NOW there are more option in the AH, and the story as far as class performance was the same.   

* Some have PM'd asking what build I ran:  At Wills were Sure Strike and WMS, and Flourish while Come and Get It was also toyed with a bit for gap closing / peeling.  Dailys were Crescendo and Slam, and my Class Features were Steel Blitz and Destroyer with the feats to reduce target # restrictions.

What do people think will actually happen to the economy based on this?  I have some guesses about what will actually impact players:
People will be much less likely to buy Zen either in the exchange or directly from PWE until this normalizes.

* In the Zen/AD exchange, legit or otherwise** However there may still be people purchasing from the Zen shops if they don't have huge amounts of Diamonds.

* Auction House will be hugely inflated in terms of AD prices. I actually see this as a *good* thing for people who don't currently have a large amount of Astral Diamonds since those with more resources will pay *a lot more* for items. I would expect to see the price for Residuum and other crafting mats go up

* The time investment for non-auction AD sources will just not be worth it for most people.  Leadership and praying/daily events won't be worth it until the AD inflation goes down.

Over time I would expect to see everything slowly revert to what we had before.  This *should* happen because of all of the AD sinks in the game (10% auction fee,,False,self,t5_2sn0p,1368988194.0,,True

Hi everyone

A few changes to the Rogue will be going to Preview with the next patch:

**At-Wills Depleting Stealth**

In the end

**Lurker's Assault**

It would be tough to argue that Lurker's Assault didn't need some re-tuning. The damage bonus on it was just too extreme for both PVE and PVP. That said

I hope you all know that you have a huge impact on the direction of the game. The Preview shard isn't just a grace period before changes go live; it is a testing ground. We rely on getting lots and lots of feedback from you guys to make sure we're taking the game in the right direction.

1371756703.0,1gqw8s,Gauntlgrym: Some rough information from a noob,CrowbarSr,13,2,1,"*Hey

Gauntlgrym is a 3 stage event that takes around 1 1/2 hours to complete. It involves two factions fighting for domination in a combination of objective

The first stage is a PvE stage
These items are then 'reforged' or 'reinforced' at their respective (now powered) objectives. These objectives are repeatable and continue until the time is up. The more items that are handed in
All players are visible within range on the minimap and it seemed effective to roam in small groups of no less than 3 to kill the mobs efficiently to obtain their drops.
The winning faction for this stage receives a 10% damage mitigation buff for the second stage and a scroll called Iron Tabernacle Share.


The second stage appears to be two events running in parallel
 The second event involves queuing up for an exclusive PvP event. This event is similar to Domination PvP apart from there are now 20 players on each team and there are 5 capture nodes. This PvP event's objective is to obtain the most amount of points within the time limit.
The interesting part of this stage is that succeeding in controlling the catapults (in Event 1) results in random bombardments in Event 2
The winning faction receives a scroll called Armories of Moradin Share.


The final stage is a pure 5-man dungeon stage. All players are warped back to the initial Gauntlgrym area where you can find a group. There are 2 dungeons
I ran the Tier 2 dungeon. It's very short and the trash mobs are very simple. The boss however was very tough and my group managed to get him to 60% HP before wiping (and our mage rage quit).

Yeah..that's it really. I shall answer some questions now.

**How can I join/travel to Gauntlgrym?**

First you need to join a guild

**How do I take part in Gauntlgrym**

To take part you simply need to be in the Gauntlgrym area (I think of it as a lobby) when the Event starts. You can check to see when the Event is happening next by pressing L and looking down the bottom for The Iron Tabernacle. You can not take part in Gauntlgrym without the Event. You can be by yourself or with a group of friends when the Event starts and you'll be ported together into the instance to start Stage 1.

**I'm overwhelmed by what's going on

Use the map and take note of the objectives on the right side of your screen. You typically need to find mobs to kill for their loot and take the loot to their respective nodes. You'll be told the name of these mobs/places

**I'm on Stage 1

Keep killing mobs and handing more in. It's a repeatable

**I'm on Stage 2

Everyone seemed a little lost initially. Most groups appear to try and zerg in a circular direction. Avoid this if possible. Tactical

**I'm on Stage 3 in the Tier 2 dungeon

I never finished it but as a healer this is what I learned. You need a CW to control the mobs that appear. They're not TOO frequent so killing them might be an option. The boss himself does massive amounts of damage when he does his large AoE circle. At ~75% health he jumps out of his suit and some sort of green poisonous gas will erupt shortly after. This will hurt everyone so keep burst heals for then. That's all I really know...sorry.

I have no attachment to the world and the it just feels empty and souless. If I dont feel the attachment to the world I am very unlikely to stick through/spend money on it. Maybe its the D&amp;D license or the NPC's. Its character names suck too!

Well first, Prospertor, Miner, Skinner, Weaver and Apothecary.

Sell Prospector in AH for 1000 AD
Sell Miner in AH for 800 AD
Sell Skinner in AH for 1300 AD
Sell Weaver in AH for 1600 AD
Sell Apothecary in AH for 1500 AD.


This means your level 10 guy can get 6


Once you have a profession at level 1


It takes 18 hours to do (just like all the hire quests) and you repeat


I recommend Hiring Weavers for the best bang for your buck. This gives you roughly 88 AD per hour per slot.

No quest in leadership gives you this much AD per hour. (protect caravan is 50 per hour)


If you spend any time leveling up a profession,000 AD right now. Thats 138 AD hour based on a 72 hour hiring cycle.

Is there anyone who would mind helping me? I just have a few questions

1. What is the Foundry? I see/hear a lot about it on /r/Nw

2. What's the most efficient way to level in this game? I'm 13 at the moment and just playing PvP since it's my favorite thing to do in MMOs but it seems rather slow. Should I stick to doing the storyline? On that note

~~3. Is there a way to que PvP/Foundry etc without having to go to the billboards/NPC? If so I seriously can't find it I looked and googled everywhere.~~
Figured out how to do this.

4. This is the most confusing one. I can't find any good resources for Rogues online anywhere. What do I max? What stats do I put points into? What feats do I get? What abilities are good? Believe it or not I can't find anything for this on google what so ever.

5. What do all the acronyms mean? CW

I'm really loving this game however as a new player I'm exceptionally confused and google surprisingly didn't help me with any of these questions.

Clerics seem to be too good at healing and dishing out damage so much so that if there are two clerics on one team

Guardian Fighters are kind of in the middle, trying to solo a Guardian Fighter is a lost battle because they can attack you whilst they are blocking, you can attack them from behind but whilst their team is backing him up, there's no way to do that unless you want to die.

Trickster Rogues are fine, why should they have a daze that lasts for 4 seconds whilst I get a two-second daze maybe? They have the advantage of cloaking so it's not as if it's hard for them to get extra attacks off on people, apart from them I don't really have an issue, they deal a lot of damage but they are squishy so it's fine.

I can't really comment on how balanced or unbalanced Great Weapon Fighter is as I've hardly ever fought one, UP or perfectly fine.

Another thing I don't really like about PVP is mounts, run to a point, cap the point, run to another point, cap that etc... etc..., I suppose they're good for getting back to the battle but because each control point gives +300 leaderboard points, people just go after them leaving the rest of their team to fight a 4v5, I don't think they're a good fit.

Within minutes of being logged into this game every fan speeds up to turbo and it sounds like its going to explode. I don't understand. I can minimize it and they'll all slow down to normal. Bring it back up and you instantly hear them kick into overdrive. 

Is it optimization issues or what?

**First off is the combat**  

This game comes fairly close to having perfect combat, mostly skills that have a large animation with multiple stages,  the biggest one for me was duelists fury.  I actually really like the idea and visual of the skill, but the long windup and lock in of the skill made me stop using it.

  I will say this the combat is still much more well done than guild wars 2 and is one of the best action combat systems I have played.  I love the skill system in that you have two main at will and 3 main skills.  It works really well and allows you to have fun and exciting combat without having to have hotbars clutter your screen.  Even though you only are using a few skills the combat is incredible deep.  You have a ton of different viable ways of building a character.  I decided on focusing on crits and my skill setup is completely different than someone who wants to stay in stealth for as much as possible.   You really have some great flexibility in this system.  

The combat is also very skill based.  At times I have been in groups where players die just because they are not very good at an action system.  Other times me and another person(2 rogues) duoed a dungeon boss because the rest of the team kept dieing and we got tired of rezzing them.    I think the skill level is also about perfect

**Second the world and instancing**

I have to say the world is really well done graphically.  It looks great and feels like the setting.  There are a few downsides though, so I understand the need,  I just with it was a bit more seemless in some parts as you tend to zone a lot and even installed on an ssd the loading times for even small zones are decent enough that they break the flow.  I really wish we had more of an open overworld,  I never mind the dungeons being instanced,  its just the instancing of the main zones makes the world feel small and seem disjoined at times. Its hard to tell where the zones connect because they do not even feel like they do connect to a different area, they feel like their own little walled garden.      

**The questing and NPC's**


It does a great job of actually leading you on an adventure and story just like a good DM in a PnP.   You are usually focused on one task at a time which I really love, even the dungeons are skirmishes are part of the story of the area you are following.  It works really well. 

The biggest thing they need to work on here is getting backstory down for all the people standing around.  It would really make the world come together as right now you just have a ton of people standing around

**Finally

 I was playing around trying to break things and I will say I found a few game breaking bugs,  they have a few bugs to work out,  the performance is actually better than I would have thought and the world actually looks really great,  I do notice a pretty big performance hit in windowed mode compared to most games.  Graphically the game looks great and it has great performance,  You have quite a bit of tweakable options.

The voice chat is also really annoying



**TLDR**
The game is looking really good so far despite the few negatives I had I am loving the game and it is looking like it will be a great game.    ",self,t5_2sn0p,1362816950.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/19ynbs/the_good_the_bad_and_the_great/

Does anyone actually complete dungeons in this game without cheese-dicking their way through with every shortcut, it's getting ridiculous. About half the time that I queue up for DD (assuming the tank and cleric don't decline the invitation, which happens approximately 85% of the time), we end up with at least one party member who wants to spend 10-20 minutes searching for just the right place to jump to avoid a few mobs, or they want to bug the boss/adds, or take advantage of some exploit that lets you reset the boss and kill him repeatedly.

I understand that not every mob in every dungeon has to be killed. I know that there are intentional shortcuts in some dungeons, **stop doing that shit.** It would be easier to just kill the mobs and proceed through the dungeon.

inb4 *""but it's faster""* - No it isn't; the first time someone dies and has to contend with respawned mobs, you've basically lost any time advantage.

**Why level crafting**

Although the benefits should be easy to see

The second reason is profit. Even with current market the expected value per crafted epic pant/shirt is from +50k to +100k with 4 mithral tools depending on server. Since tools are about 800k per piece

1.  PVE is way too easy for the amount of people in it.  Should there be trash mobs that are easy to clear for undergeared players?  Sure.  But there should also be epic level dragon type monsters that a group can take down for a higher count of drops.  Farming trash isn't that fun to be honest.

2.  PVP is too zergy.  Adding casters that kick people off their horses

3.  It doesn't matter how good you do, it is the servers performance in the event.  This is madness.  As we ran through on autopilot in the T1 our whole group was wondering why the hell we even bothered to try.  Why bother other than to make a jump macro and hop every 5 seconds in pve, and see what random dungeon you end up in?  We fought really hard, and played very hard, and did very well.  Someone we weren't grouped with, were not guilded with, did not know, or just awful in their pvp in a completely different instance.  If a group wins its 20v20 pvp they should get to go into the t2.  Socialism isn't fun in video games since the results are felt as just arbitrary

1. Raids have been announced but not yet released. (chances are the gear obtained here will make the gear obtained ""less than honorably"" from T2's not matter so much)

2. Drow's have not been released. Come on... Everyone wants to play Drizzt. That is why they are holding them back 

3. follow up to second...Rangers and warlocks have been leaked again everyone wants to play Drizzt. 

4. Everyone has 2 Paragon paths that are still locked. We don't even know what all the classes play like. Imagine if we were all playing wow and every warlock was only Demonology or every Rogue was Sub. The game would totally change when they opened the other talent trees. 

5. You CAN actually play for free. Sure if you want to get everything out of the game you need to pay money. But you can get a mount for 5g (that is slow

6. FOUNDRY! You want to make Astral Diamonds? Make a good Foundry Map and keep supporting it. I have had people tell me they make TONS from their foundry map in tips. Sure it takes a TON of time and is a LOT of work but they had fun with it and it is literally free money. It is something totally unique that no other game has done before. 

7. If you do want to MIN/MAX lets you need to spend your $40ish to get your character set up...then probably $20ish a month on respecs BUT there is a cool thing. In wow you had a sub

At the end of the day....I think the most important thing we do is give this game more than 2 weeks before we cast it into the volcano. Stop blowing hundreds of dollars (because I assure you the next tier will make all this gear useless) and farm your own gear.

I've been playing it ever since

Before I thought posting here was a consideration

- Intuitive. Everything about this game feels very fluid, the minimalist UI, adventuring...

- Baldurs Gates meets GW2. Game-world unlike any other I've experienced in an mmo- the feel of a Baldurs Gate/ Demon Souls, more filling experience.

- Storytelling- The dialogue cinematics were not cringed at. In fact

- Complete immersion. If you appreciate sound, your screen gets darker as the sounds around you are deafened by a thumping heartbeat. Campfires found at the scarcely located safe zones changes this. While your character replenishes his health with each pulse of warm campfire ambiance you notice a sense of calm- the music is soft, the conversation around you muffled and chill, and the fire crackles throughout it all- all this detail went into the sound alone. To heightened this effect, the moment you step outside of your campfire, the music gets tense, the color palette gets dark around you, which I really appreciate since it's a D&amp;D title.

TL;DR Totally surprised by Neverwinter. Journaled my immediate reflections and thought this subreddit may be interested.

Daily 2: Singularity

RC: Freeze Ray

Passives: I take the one that gives increased AOE damage and the one that gives your cold damage a buff when you stack Arcane Mastery points.

Summary: My build is mostly focused on taking out groups of enemies as fast as possible with Chilling Strike and Summoning Storm while saving Force Choke for the stronger enemies.  I use Shield when surrounded or when my Chilling Strike/Force Choke spells are on cooldown.  I use the Ice Explosion daily when solo and Singularity when grouped.  I've used Chilling Strike on tab ever since level 10 because I've haven't really found anything else that fits as well as that.

Minor background info:  I'm a broke ass college student

The game is there for enjoyment

* You don't want to pay $60 like you normally would for a game on release?  Awesome

* You don't want to pay a monthly subscription?  Awesome you don't have to.

* You don't want to have to pay at all

* You want to bitch and complain that you don't get certain things right away, and don't understand how basic economic stability of a company works?  Go ahead, but you're just going to be frustrated while wallowing in your own ignorance.

In games like SWTOR when they switched to the F2P model, and other things.  If you don't want to, you're limited on what you can do, and can only play so much depending on what interests you.

The big complaint that I see people forming is one based off of ignorance and entitlement.  The game can't keep updating and releasing new content, and want to play through everything without a dime, that's fine.  You'll have to farm the gear and stuff yourself, which is awesome.

People are getting caught up in the fact that SOMEONE ELSE might pay this company money in order to buy currency, if someone is going to provide this service, we might as well cut out the middle man, and legitimize it.""  Hell, they allow their own players to make money off of it.

Some other arguments I've seen are ""MOBAs have a good business model that doesn't affect gameplay""

1.  Players have the ability to buy experience boosts to get to level 30 faster.  They are skipping learning the game

2.  You can buy IP boosts so you can earn runes faster

3.  You can buy champions if you don't have the earned currency

The above example sounds identical to what is going in this game

If someone wants to buy their way through a game, if you want to pay for something that will reduce a grind, while you have been playing a game they spent a shit ton of time on FOR FREE, then I think that should be an option.

If you are so worried with the SOMEONE ELSE might get an advantage, and I might toss them some money here and there to reduce some grind, buy some skin, or improve the enjoyment of the game through some minor facet.

I don't care to hear any arguments

1. **Server :** Dragon server; however

1. **Stage :** The Lost Boy has proceeded through the REVIEW foundry stage! It is now in the NEW column

1. **What to expect? :** Expect a quest that takes you through multiple zones that have been customized to fit the quest line. I have taken great care in the design and have placed a lot of work into the dungeon to make it a memorable experience.

1. **Dialogue :** There are no 'fail' dialogue responses; so those of you who wish may skip the dialogue (of which there are  four instances of).

1. **Limitations :** The quest has been painstakingly reviewed and tested by characters ranging from level 5 to 56

***Recommendations :***
 
**ALMOST TOO EASY :** 4-5 People (16-18 minutes)

**NORMAL NANCIES :** 3 People (20-22 minutes)

**HARD ROCKERS :** 2 People (23-25 minutes)

**PREPARE TO REVIVE :** 1 Crazy person (25-30 minutes)

The above information is based off of multiple play-tests by level 40s and above.

1368339013.0,1e66zl,Upcoming classes based on D&amp;D 4th edition.,overgun77,9,1,20,"Playing NWO got me interested in 4e of D&amp;D. I haven't played a game yet

**Races**

* Dragonborn: Basically humanoid dragons favoring martial classes. Strenght and Charisma are their favored stats. Their racials might include a dragonbreath encounter attack
* Eladrin: They live in the Feywild

**Upcoming Classes and Paragon Paths**

In D&amp;D 4e, a GWF has access to all the powers of a GF, so it's hard to determine which skills will be assigned to the upcoming classes, also, the classes share the same features, for example a GWF and GF both have the same class features, so how the classes will be implemented (if they are ever implemented) might differ on the list. I will list the base class and the available builds as well as the available Paragon paths for the base classes

**Cleric**

* Battle Cleric: Favoring strength and going straight in the frontline.
 Some of the at-wills favored by this build are: *Priest's Shield*: Each attack puts up a defensive prayer upon you. And *Righteous Brand*: With your hit, while keeping strong capabilities of healing. The role they might fulfill is that of a Leader/Striker.

Paragon Paths:

*Angelic Avenger*: AoE DMG and utility.

*Radiant Servant*: Fire based spells and powerful healing.

*Warpriest*: Party buffs casted as you attack.

**Fighter**

Paragon Paths:

*Kensei*: Nimble warrior with strong defensive and offensive abilities with a strong focus on the weapon.

*Pit Fighter*: Ultimate 1-on-1 fighting skills


**Paladin**: A Defender, Wis

* Avenging Paladin: The GWF of the Fighter class. Using two handed weapon with offensive skills and debuffing the adversary. Smiting non-believers to death.
* Protecting Paladin: Shield and Sword/Mace/Axe. Hits imbues the holiness upon your enemies. Skills damages enemies and buffs your allies at the same time

Paragon paths:

*Astral Weapon*: DPS path

*Champion of Order*: Bring divine judgement to the wicked. Weapon shines in the presence of evil creatures. Offensive Tank path.

*Hospitaler*: Party buffs and utility.

*Justiciar*: Tank utility

**Ranger**

* Archer Ranger: The Archer class. nuff said.
* Two-weapon Ranger: Dual wielding melee class. Very nimble with abilities to avoid damage.

Paragon Paths:

*Battlefield Archer*: Become one with the bow

*Beast Stalker*: Use companion and summoned beast to aid in the fight. Bring some party utility.

*Pathfinder*: This is for two-weapon rangers. Scouts, lots of mechanics to avoid damage.

*Stormwarden*: Full out offensive of two-weapon ranger with lots of unrelenting attacks while using two weapons.

**Rogue**

* Brawny Rogue: This is more focused on head on combat

Paragon Paths:

*Cat Burglar*: Lots of mobility and avoiding damage.

*Daggermaster*: Critical attacks

*Shadow Assassin*: Counter attacks

**Warlock**
This is the offensive casting class. This one fills the role of a Striker, I won't do it justice on this post. They favor both, melee and ranged attack.

* Deceptive Warlock: AoE debuffers
* Scourge Warlock: Head on destruction.
Paragon paths:

*Doomsayer*: Description: ""You wrap yourself in the fear of the darkness beyond the stars and use it as a shield against your enemies. In Addition you examine the strands of fate to issue proclamations of doom to all who stand against you"" This is the definition of badassery. Strong debuffing

*Feytouched*: Summoning. Bend the will of your enemies.
*Life-stealer*: Self explanatory? :)

**Warlord**
This is a Leader. Healing damage and providing buffs and other sorts of utility to the party. Melee character.

* Inspiring Warlord: Buff up party, cure conditions/debuffs.

* Tactical Warlord: Offensive buffs, more power, control the battlefield with knockdowns.

Paragon Paths:

*Battle Captain*: Tactical Warlod in steroids.

*Combat Veteran*: Brings some offensive capabilities to the warlord.

*Knight Commander*: Brings some defensive capabilities to the warlord

*Sword Marshal*: Brings additional offensive buffs to the party and some damage capabilities.

**Wizard**

* War Wizard: Damge dealer

Paragon Paths:

*Battle Mage*: Brings upclose spells and damage capabilities.

*Blood Mage*: Use own blood to cast powerful spells and buff up damage

*Wizard of the Spiral Tower*: Has the ability to use a sword and channel arcane magic through the sword. Sounds very intriguing.

Most of the Foundry quests I've done so far seem to be fairly simple, read C, repeat until finished"". Occasionally there's a twist in there somewhere, or a tough to find clue, but most of the time that's the pattern. And while that's fine for quick Exp + Diamonds from the daily, it doesn't interest me so much.

What I'm really interested in making is more complex quests and campaigns that really reward those who spend the time to find small clues. Quests that force you to decide between factions, quests which have different qualities of ending - if you manage to find those crucial pieces of evidence and piece together what happened, you get the ""better"" ending which unwraps the conspiracy; but if you don't you're just thanked for your service. The gear reward is the same; the story reward is different.

So what I suppose I'm asking is how many of those things are possible, but also there will be plenty of resources to give tips on it - but all advice appreciated.",,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,

1368017025.0,1dxfjd,Neverwinter: Analysis,cyanbane,17,9,26,"I am one of the people who had never really paid attention to Neverwinter as people started to discuss it. I had thought that it was a full revamp of the Neverwinter Nights series (which I enjoyed) but would be heavily instanced along the same lines as the predecessor of its main IP: Dungeons and Dragons Online (DDO). I have nothing against ""Collective Lobby MMOs"" as I like to call them

**Pros: F2P Implementation - Its not F2P vs P2P - (Hint: It’s both)**

Free To Play (F2P) and Pay to Win (P2W)... To most it sounds as though it is the same thing - but in my world they are not - there is a subtle distinction. I consider F2P as a decent game without a monthly sub that continues to exist by selling items to players and/or by manipulating in game currency markets to its favor. P2W is the existence of the ability to purchase non- cosmetic enhancements to your game's entity that will give it a direct advantage.

Avg Joe Gamer can signup and play through a decent chunk of the content without paying for anything but the initial game. Neverwinter (NW) has gone one step further in not even requiring the initial game purchase. Solid F2P games always have a mechanic that allows the player to accomplish a task without purchase, or you can buy them directly (zen) or indirectly (astral diamonds). In short, if you need more identification scrolls and don't have time to farm them you can always purchase more with RWC. That is F2P in a nutshell, and I think NW has done a good job with implementing it. I like that NW has not gone the ""first X levels route"" with F2P (think Rift), which really is just proxy trial. While NW is limiting you to slots for different containers and mount types it does follow the normal ""holding back for cash"" mentality of F2P. I will touch on P2W in the cons section.

**Pro: Staggered Introduction**

One thing that I really like about the game’s introduction model is that certain features of the game are not used until level requirements are met at certain points. Auction House is ""introduced"" at lvl 10, etc. It gives a good slow introduction to the game’s mechanics and gives you time to get used to each one for a slight bit until the next one is introduced. One interesting thing is that you also cannot utilize Zen (the RWC proxy) until level 10. I have been trying to figure out why this is. I would think as a biz they would want to accept RWC as soon as possible, however I think this may be a tool to slow down ""zen laundering"" assuming it is hard to move around purchasable items with low level characters. Regardless the reason it is an interesting decision and should be noted.

**Pro: Lore/World - SpellPlague**

I am a Dragonlance guy. By the time I was getting to college I believe I had read every dragonlance book available. I felt like it was almost like picking your favorite baseball team in picking the realm that you wanted to read from TSR/D&amp;D's worlds. You had the Forgotten Realms people, etc. I did dabble in Forgotten Realms a bit. I always enjoyed the Drizzt stories and Elminister always intrigued me, I played the Balder's Gates and TSR's Menzoberranzan, so if I had to choose a secondary TSR world I think Forgotten Realms would be it. That being said I never read really far into any of the lore of Faerun. The [Spellplague storyline](http://community.wizards.com/gomeztoo/blog/2010/01/11/the_forgotten_realms_post-spellplague_timeline) is new to me and I like how they are implementing so far into the (main?) storyline of the game. I don't think they have done a great job in separating out and describing the different deities (maybe later in the game?) however the overall storyline and where it fits into the Forgotten Realms canon seems well done from an outside perspective. It is probably both a blessing and a curse to use such a deeply developed world.

**Pro: Foundry**

One of the best aspects of the game. If you had described it to me before the game’s release I would have just thought (oh look another player gen'd content store) and not thought anything of it (aka EQ2). There are three things that were well done about the Foundry: rewards

I was amazed when I saw I was earning decent xp and loot from my first foundry mission. The rewards were in no way over the top

Last, however I feel like 90% is crap (subjective) content that I just don't care to do. If you have a method to bubble up that 10% of good stuff to the top so that I can grok it quickly to see if it is worth the little time that I have to play MMOs, then I will certainly check it out. NW has done this and done it well. I hope the ""rankings"" don't start to get swayed too much and go the way of the iOS app store where they are not really all that representative of the content. As players of this game I think we need make sure that we are leaving feedback to keep the system going in the right direction.

**Pro: Scheduled Content &amp; Bitesized Content**

As I mentioned above I was very impressed with the Foundry mission but there was an extra bonus that I received because of bonus time period. I like the way that during the course of my play time there is usually one or two bonus areas that are listed, player generated, etc) that I normally would not try out. I also like the fact that some of these content types don't take too long to accomplish. The Foundry quest seem to have average times from 17-100+ mins, while the skirmishes seem to take around 20. I like the fact that the average times are posted and I know if I am going to have time to get that content in fully with my limited playtime. Some of the 100+ min Foundry missions may be skewed by only one or two players trying them and taking much longer than the normal player, so there should be a minimum before calculating that on Cryptic’s side.

**Neutral: Twitch Based Combat**

I am still at odds with the combat system inside NW. I like the twitch focusing, or I think I have the right entity targeted but the action ends up going off on another. These are small quibbles I know but enough to keep me on the fence for the twitch combat for the time being. It may just be that I need to be slower in my setup. I may revisit this point after playing the game more.

**Neutral: Engine Seems very familiar**

I have not seen anything outright saying the Turbine's LOTRO engine was used in Neverwinter, down to the font above people's heads. It looks like I am not the only one2 who has this thought also.

**Neutral: It's Too Easy**

As of thus far (level 20 Rogue) the game is extremely easy. I think I have had 2 places where I actually felt challenged playing solo and only 1 when I had my healing companion with me. I like a little bit of challenge, but I can say that when paired with a healer, there really isn't much content at this level that would give us any hesitation. Maybe this changes closer to endgame, or the endgame moves to PvP which mitigates this somewhat.

**Neutral: P2P Mats**

Tradesmithing in NW seems to be very similar to Star Wars The Old Republic in which you essentially hire underlings to perform the skills which take a certain allotted amount of time. This system is used in Guild Wars 2 for guild missions and also somewhat for spell level research in Everquest 2. I actually like this version of tradeskilling and it also prompts the user to login every now and then to requeue different objectives to advance. It puts the onus on time rather than some type of twitch setup (think EQ2). So why did I not list this as a pro?

Materials.

I am still trying to confirm but it looks like some materials that are needed are completely Pay based. I don't dig this at all. All mats should be farmable. Instead of making the recipes available to all without paying it seems like Cryptic has determined that they would just allow other recipes (not pay) to be used which would in essence be slower. If true and they are unfarmable I don't like that strategy personally. I won't put it in the con column because I understand it

**Con: ""Open Beta"" WTF does that mean?**

As someone who had not been keeping up with this game, but I had not heard of it used this way before.

**Con: So Many Currency Types**

Gold, Zen, Ardent Coins, Celestial Coins, Rough Astral Diamonds, Tarmalune Bars, Glory, Many Arrows Insignias

Way too confusing. If you are going to do this then there needs to be an in game listing of ALL currency types and what type of vendors and tiers use them and how they are acquired.

**Con: P2W (Epic Enchants at higher level?)**

So circling back to the above about Pay 2 Win vs Free 2 Play

At this point I am not even near confirming the below

*Armor/Weapon Enchantments are for specific slots in your weapon/chest and grant special effects. They come in shards and have a chance to drop from Epic Dungeon bosses. You must combine 4 shards to create a Lesser version of the Enchantment. However, the real kicker here is that these ""Lesser"" versions may be fused again to gain a stronger version. Those may also be fused again to create the strongest version. Ultimately, the Greater Thunderhead Enchantment will have a 30% on crit to damage and stun foes. To create the strongest Enchantment possible, it will cost 160 dollars and 64 shards. Unlike companions, these can be used in PvP.*

Taken from [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Neverwinter/comments/1dry0g/neverwinters_f2p_model_what_you_need_to_know/).

If that is the case then I will be enjoying this game up until I am no longer competitive spending $15 a month (sub!) on items in this game. I don't know the drop rates of these things

I have been playing D&amp;D for a very long time, was born. 


That being said, and decided it would make a better MMO than tabletop game. And suddenly, Neverwinter is in open beta. It's a really fun game, and i'm enjoying it immensely, but I think I am misunderstanding something. I assumed that the Great Weapon Fighter was the closest thing I was going to get to a Greataxe-wielding Barbarian, since they don't actively come out with classes in this game. They wear medium armor and have amazing damage when geared correctly.


My question is that I don't know how I should be playing this class. I understand it's a great melee class, or at least that's my guess. Can they DO good ST damage? Can I spec my GWF in such a way that will allow Parda to deal out damage? Does the AoE damage equal out or at least match up to other people's damage? Or do I need to try and start all over with a different type of character?

- Scheduling -- Since a big attraction of MMOs is playing with friends
- End-game or bust -- Many modern MMOs view the level climb as a prelude to serious raiding at level cap.
- Falling behind -- Unless we only played with each other, making it harder to group and enjoy content together.

Mind you

I get the sense that this MMO solves a lot of the problems I listed with the content creation.  I don't see anything in FAQs about playing with others at different levels, really, because you could download or create a crappy adventure and award yourself a bazillion XPs at any time.  The point was to simulate to some degree a tabletop experience where you didn't need a DM to run you through everything.

Is that right for this MMO?  From those of you who have tinkered with the beta,False,self,t5_2sn0p,False,,,t3_1ax0yt

2. Will multi-classing be an option?  I know that many of my friends enjoy that aspect of DnD (Duskblade-Cleric go!) and I think it would be great if it was included.

3. What kind of prestige classes are going to be available?  Will there be multiple per base class?  When will they be available
