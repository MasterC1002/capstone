OK

1) It should not be so awkward that only a virgin 12 year old will like it.

2) Females should look similar to real human beings. No woman has a boob bigger than double the size of her head.

I always get a bit sad when every ""What are some great games I can get for free?""-threads are answered with the same 3 games every time. So I decided to make a list of great freeware-titles *without* Cave Story and friends for once. All of these games are highly enjoyable and I'll try to give a brief explanation of each one. Also

[★★★] = good game

[★★★★] = great game

[★★★★★] = stop everything you are doing right now and download this shit.

*List is not sorted in any way*
_____

**Pixelships** [★★★★] [Link](http://pixelships.com/pxs_details.html)

Combine classic DOS-space shooters with Pokémon-like „collect 'em all“-gameplay and you get Pixelships. Sadly

**Blockball Evolution** [★★★★] [Link](http://www.blockball.de/)

Made by students of the german „Games Academy“ in Frankfurt. A Marble Madness-Clone with somewhat clunky controlls but highly enjoyable gameplay and a level editor!

**Synasthete** [★★★] [Link](http://www.fishbeat.com/games/synaesthete/)

Holy Hell, it's also a bit too easy. Created by students at DigiPen.

Probably my favourite platformer on the web. If you liked the 16-Bit Sonics in any way

A monochrome

**GeneRally** [★★★] [Link](http://gene-rally.com/)

A cute and chaotic miniature racing game that plays kind of like micro machines. While not incredibly fun when played alone

**Hub**: you get to move freely around a small area at a time

**Mission Based**: you get to choose the order of missions somewhat

5/5 *Alpha Protocol*

4/5 *Dragon Age series*


**Railroaded**: you have to go straight along the story

5/5 *the Walking Dead*

1/5 *Binary Domain*


**18+/Pornographic**: title says it all...

3/5 *Corruption of Champions* is all about choosing between being corrupted into a sex-demon or staying pure in the face of temptation


**???**: haven't played them myself

5/5 *Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura*

I suffered far too long from the ""no-games-to-play"" syndrome.

i've got nearly 200 games in my steam library and had always some difficulties choosing ""the one"" that i actually wanted to play.
in the process of choosing i often entered a state of depression


Recently i watched another episode of Dragonball (the first tournament). I thought about the system and how they tried to evaluate who fights who. Simply put


hopefully you get my idea by now :)

**My Solution:**

i made a list of my Steam library (i moved to the ""common"" folder via commandline

**So i started with Round 1:**
i let the games fight against each other

**Round 2:** 
the same procedure as Round 1.

* 1v1 (top vs bottom)

* compare qualities to needs

* move to round 3

**That way i came down to 6 games:** 

* BioShock Infinite

* Dead Space

* Fallout 3 goty

* Gothic II

* Morrowind

* The Witcher Enhanced Edition


I am perfectly fine with the selection given me by that list and want to play each game it contains. Now comes the hard part

The whole procedure (including writing this post) took me a good hour. Creating the list and fighting the tournament took me 20 minutes + 10 minutes for what we call in austria ""brainfapping"" (actually thinking about this post

The post took me roughly half an hour. It's obvious that english ain't my first language

Basically, made by a team of no-name Russian developers who years later went on to develop recent King's Bounty titles, amongst other things.  
You are a ranger - a space mercenary, but no obligations either - in fact, you can do whatever and watch other rangers win the game for you.  
It all boils down to ""get more money, well, kill invaders and sell loot for profit; you can be a pirate and either rob civilian ships or just blow them up and pick up what's left; you can trade goods (buy low, sell high, nothing special) blowing up pirates as you go; or you can help governments on their missions, ranging from simple FedEx quests to text-based adventures. There are in fact hundreds of those, from simple puzzles to various simulators, all written on the game's own engine.  
Oh
The sequel adds more stuff, buffs, debuffs and enchantments (stims, hacks and modules in technobabble), real time strategy battles with with custom robots, and so on, is generally superior in every way and vastly recommended over the original (the game doesn't exactly have a lengthy plotline so there's nothing to miss)  
Despite its seeming simplicity, the price of goods depends on supply and demand, economical system and the type of government the planet has. Or, aside from you there are hundreds of ships, maybe thousands, and every single ship does the things they do depending on their internal logic - traders watch the market, read news, etc, etc.

Graphics aren't huge but a nice aesthetic is important. I couldn't get into Gothic because it's aesthetic was just.. off to me. Yet I loved the way Baldur's Gate looks. It just looks pleasing

As for how I'm playing, no one else. I'm looking for an Elder Scrolls feel where my hero is the focus of my game, I guess.

The game play isn't too important as to what I'm focusing on. I just want to start kinda weak, the works. That's the biggest thing I look for in an RPG. Whether or not it's turn-based or click to swing doesn't matter, so long as it's intuitive and I don't have to draw magic or something, haha.

As for what I'd be playing it on

Story would be nice to have, that's just my take on it. I mean, the better the story, the happier I am. But I'm not the kind of gamer who stopped playing Fallout 3 because it wasn't anywhere near up to par of Fallout 1/2.

* The dungeon has a top view and is divided into sections. At any time you can see only your room and a very little bit into the neighboring room.


* You have 4 characters throughout the game. You control them at the same time.

**Edit: Added some more info since people said it sounds generic.**

* At a time you cannot see the whole map. You can only see 2-3 rooms max. The rooms appear big. The characters are about the size of Dota Heroes on screen kind of.

And then I played Borderlands 2. If you haven't played yet (I really recommend it) there's an enemy called Goliath. If you shoot a Goliath in the head it goes on a rampage fighting every living thing around. And the best thing is that when it kills his companions he can level up and grow bigger and stronger

The perfect thing for me would probably be a first person adventure game where I can be/am on godmode and I can watch/manipulate fights between loads and loads of different npcs.

Personally, even though there is no ship, and it is one of my all time favorites. But traditionally I've not played many space sims, so I am hesitant to jump into them, especially since some (X3) I hear have a steep learning curve.

I would like to see if we can make a list of all these games along with key features and how to decide which one is right for people.

**To Define it** - this genre is a mix between RPG set in a large world with Small unit tactical fights when you encounter enemies. Combat and trade and (sometimes) politics are allowed. Economy is important.

You Start off with one person/ship and you expand, and they too might progress in an RPG fashion.

There is strategy and resources but these are **NOT** 4x games. And not JUST space flight sims. 

Though EVE online is certainly one of these

**EXAMPLE GAMES:**

* X Series
* Freelancer
* Sid Meiers Pirates!
* Mount and Blade

There are a ton more... If you have played one

**Questions to answer:**

* Ease or Complexity to Learn?
* Realistic Death (Perm Death vs Just losing Ship
* How ""deep"" is the economy - What can/can't you buy?
* How open is the game or is it Story Driven?
* Realism vs Cartoony
* More Simulation or RPG oriented?
* Can you hire crew/companions? How detailed is this?
* Can you make your own ship

I don't know about you, you can find that kind of information in reviews and the like, but what makes the /r/Games thread so special is that anyone can contribute and any game can be discussed! It is so refreshing to see peopel discussing games that were released decades ago right alongside games that were released only a few days ago. These types of discussions help to bring up major points about a game without ruining the experience for those of us who have not yet managed to play some of these games, or who may be on the fence on whether or not to purchase a game.

This is where /r/WhatAreYouPlaying comes in! It is an entire subreddit dedicated to discussing the games that you are currently playing, plus a few more objectives. While the /r/Games discussion may be enough for some, I know I am craving just a little bit more, so with /r/WhatAreYouPlaying, we hope to:

* Foster any and all discussion about games of the past and present
* Unlike the current threads
* Entire threads can be dedicated to single games
* Bring players of old and new games together for invigorating discussions.
* Limit all posts to self-posts so as to not have the front page cluttered with nonsense

Lastly, especially those with low player counts. I know it can be hard sometimes to find gamers to play certain games with online due to lack of server support, general lack of players, or just a need to play with individuals who meet our gamer criteria. With this new community, I hope to merge the field of ""What are you playing"" with the need to find gamers for a particular game, so that there is a one-stop community where everyone can go to find gamers that they want to play with, and to discuss the current games they are playing.

I'm looking for a game to get hooked on until D3 and GW2 come out.  Genre-wise

Civ 5 kept me occupied for a month

I'd like to play more games that have fun exploration mechanics. I love exploring new places in games and finding cool things in out-of-the-way locations and so on

I like it when games reward you for poking around and exploring. For example: games like The Last of Us where, or the Serious Sam games, where clever thinking and exploration can bring you to whole new areas and get you secret items, are good, if small, examples of this. However, I often explore too much and it becomes very tedious getting back to the main action if there's a large area to look around and nothing really in it. Games like Dark Souls that can give you a huge reward for exploring (finding two entire levels because you broke through a few fake walls) are fantastic

Things I'm not really too excited about are exploration systems like WoW or some parts of Oblivion where you can find a really neat area or location, but a lot of the time there are just a few little secrets in a *HUGE* world, and it isn't really worth it to look for them.

As far as the games go, I love a great story and soundtrack. Graphics aren't really a big point, but I do like games that look nice. Basically, I love the hell out of the first Deus Ex (looks like ass), but I also love games like Dark Souls and Tales of Graces (looks pretty damn great).

Torchlight II: I showed this to him and he looked interested. This might be the current front-runner because he can still play this with his friends.

AoE II: I had never played this game when I was younger

FTL: I don't know about this one. I *loved* the game, as it tends to be one of those games where you only really enjoy it when you play it yourself.

Now

The following ideas are not put in any specific order, or nearly all, resources should have meaningful uses, and a balanced tradeoff should exist between all competing resources. There should be no spawn points in the traditional sense, because they become exploitable and players place them on farm. Instead, there should be a breeding mechanic for wild and domesticated animals. Owning a farm would become a viable playstyle. Breeding should also allow for super-breeds which increase some aspect of the species. Skills should decay on inactivity. There should be an exponential curve in regards to building a skill and effort placed into it. The decay of a skill should begin slow and accelerate if left to fester. Writing or reading a book should allow players to retain their skill without decay and also avoid using materials in a method similar to grinding. Books should have diminishing returns, though. So if you only own one book, a lot. Failure can be mundane, and skill gained in magic should be slow going. But skill, and other methods of mass transportation of goods must exist to allow players to move items. Bandits should have legitimate opportunity to be bandits. Being a bandit does not mean killing people and laughing that you destroyed the fruits of their labor. Being a bandit means you kill a convoy of caravans in the wilderness and loot their wares to sell as your own. Killing all witnesses and never revealing your criminal behavior to anyone is what it means to be a successful bandit. Outlaws should exist

I will edit this later for readability, I want to just put ideas out there to be commented on and feed the discussion of the community. It just occurred to me, that the most important aspect that is missing from many attempts at creating an MMOS is the RPG. You don't need programmed content to roleplay. In fact, storyline quests actually railroad roleplaying. You do need a dynamic framework and other players willing to meld into your narrative. So, I guess, what I really want to create is a MMOSRPG. (MMOSandboxRPG for you slow ones.)

EDIT::
Additional suggestions:
Apprenticing other players via some sort of cooperative crafting option. Also
An example of complexity in resources would be building a fire for refining iron to steel. Certain amounts of certain wood would create the necessary temperature. Or
A dynasty system could lessen the impact of permadeath, if you're wealthy and not into raising children.
I didn't originally like the idea of NPCs, you hire an NPC to sell something for a target price, or you locate a mineral vein and hire NPCs to hack away at it and transport the minerals to a gathering point. These NPCs should be VERY expensive (read: almost null profit margin), so that they do not force players out of the occupation they fill. The NPCs should be there to mitigate a lack of interest in an occupation, not cause players to not participate in those occupations. They should also be vulnerable. In addition to hiring these NPC workers, you would either need to personally guard them, or hire guards to protect them from dangers of the wild and or bandits
You should have a visual tool to customize almost everything in game via dyes
Every action should be taken to combat bots and macros and afk exploiters.
Dedicated staff who play specific roles in the game and are hugely important to the main city. Think about how awesome it would be to have every important character in the main city interactive because there's a player behind it. They would have specific mandated goals and roles
Local chat, no guild chat.
Module construction/building. You should be able to build walls, windows, doors, etc and create whatever buildings you want... And if you don't build it properly, you can watch it fall apart, or have it fall apart on you...

These are in no order

  
  
**GAMES I LIKE A LOT**  
Okami - amazing stylization, hidden stuff. It's just a really grand adventure full of giant and ominous things and captures 'culture' really well (through specific instruments and settings).  
  
.  
  

Metal Gear Solid 3 (series) - I don't think I need to explain why I like MGS3. Everything is incredible. Perfect stealth, variability, boss fights, plot, levels as they relate to stealth, etc. In terms of whole series, sometimes plot gets too convoluted
  
.  
  
Viewtiful Joe - Arcade-y rule type gameplay. It's kind of like Scream, cool use of powers.
  
.    
  

Braid - Mind bending genius puzzles with the coolest ending I've ever seen
  
.  
  

Portal - Game makes really good uses(aka puzzles) out of a feature that I've dreamed of (portaling). Runs super smooth and is just plain fun to use. It's also like a semi-horror movie, it's just you and surviving.  
  
.  
  


GTA San Andreas - I've always liked street gang things, and great controls. Missions were pretty varied as well. I hated GTA4.  
  
.  
  


Wind Waker - I love the sailing, cool dungeons, all that LoZ stuff except it didn't get as stale (though I'm not even done with it yet, but I do like it more than I've enjoyed the Zelda's I have played).  
  
.  
  


God of War (series) - I like Greek mythology, grand boss battles, nice variety on enemies and what they do, cool little things that break up the game (like chain swinging or platforming bits or whatever). It's a great story with really nice controls and variety behind it.  
  
.  
  


Kingdom Hearts (1 2) - Travelling across Disney worlds, enemies ranged from cute to dark-awesome, get some cool abilities, all that RPG stuff.  
  
.  
  


Parappa the Rapper - What a music game should be. It gives you a template of what a song is, sometimes randomly mashing stuff was also considered good, but the point remains that I can still do whatever I want to the song. I also like the style a lot. It's just a cute and silly game, from story (conflicts and characters) to song basis.  
  
.  
  


Shadow of the Colossus - Dream like world, the grandness of the boss fights and the almost intuitive cool puzzle-like effect of taking them down. There were times in the game where I tried something overly complex to try and beat a boss, and I knew it was too complex thanks to the game just needing you to think a little more. Nice consequential puzzles. And holy s*** were some of those bosses epic.  
  
.  
  



Phoenix Wright - It's silly, like Braid (except Braid goes beyond our dimension).  
  
.  
  


Super Mario World - Just everything good about Mario games. Great enemies, great music to reflect what's going on, nice power ups. Really kind of does feel like a world, cause the levels have some base with how the world is.  
  
.  
  


Super Mario 64 - I thought it was really neat that all you had was just a tiny hint of where the Star could be, etc. The overworld was also really awesome too.  
  
.  
  


Donkey Kong Country 2 - Everything about SMW, the placement started getting trickier, and as Sirlin has said (great article), I actually did kind of start to think of where the developer might put it next. It's like developer vs player first, and awesome platformer after.  
  
.  
  


Megaman 9 - Tight controls and the game put you in specific situations that required you to make the most out of your character. Whenever you die
  
.  
  


Spiderman 2 - The great swinging mechanic with free world. Really that's it. I'd play (and can still play) this game and just swing around doing Spidey favors for random civilians for hours at a time. I felt like Spiderman
  
.  
  


Bioshock - Lots and lots of detail to a really interesting and awesome world. There's also cool powerups you get. I'm only halfway done with this game so far. I lost it

What i liked about the game was that the learning curve is not too steep. Eg Europe Universalis has a really steep learning curve which puts me off really quickly. I'm a casual gamer so I don't want to read manuals for hours before hitting the game.

Also money is a problem. I can't really afford a game so it'll have to be under 20$ and no monthly payments. The newest games will not run on my system (hitman absolution is i think the limit of my machine).

I'm looking for a game where a single playing session has lasting influence. Red Alert, start again, play a map, start again. Rome TW campaign is longer which makes it more fun for me.  Warcraft III has the same issue, though you advance in a campaign, each next map is just starting over again. Another great casual game is Transport Tycoon or Minecraft but i've noticed that both lack enough direction for me).

but i noticed in total war that after a while i autoplayed most battles

So looking at my options now

i thought medieval total war was too similar to Rome. Can anybody contrast Shogun 2

I can't finish Bioshock Infinite because pure (single player) FPS games are boring as hell to me.  The entirety of their mechanics/tricks-of-the-trade are introduced to you in the first 5 min (actually... make that 20 years ago) and the only thing pushing you from then on is the story.

I can't finish a Total War campaign anymore because once I've seen a faction's interesting units I don't have any motivation to continue.

I couldn't finish Dishonored because once I toyed around with most of the abilities I realized the only thing left was to plod through the missions.  And they were alright

I couldn't finish Skyrim because.. well it sucked overall.  But I couldn't finish it once I hit around level 30 and I realized there was no challenge and no big, I had some crazy weapons, and I've seen dragons/dragon priests, most of the game world, etc.

So I think the problem is that once I've seen a game's novel elements and all that's left for me is to complete the game for completion's sake

Are there any games that don't have this problem?  Are there any games that introduce genuinely new mechanics/aspects throughout the story

1351051411.0,11zmi9,Should I try Baldur's Gate instead?,partisparti,13,4,11,"Hey guys.  Sorry if this isn't exactly the right subreddit for this question

Over the past few months I've really grown to respect and love some old games that I had never really considered before for the sole purpose that they were old.  It started when I decided to finally give Vampire: The Masquerade a try and I fucking LOVED it.  So, which is touted as one of the best (if not the best) RPG of all time.

I'm only about two hours in - definitely not far enough to form any real opinions about the game - and I'm trying to give it a chance, and I can see why people love this game.  But it just hasn't *grabbed* me yet, and I think a big part of that might be the fact that I've never really played a top down RPG like that before, and I'm a little put off by the fact that the game really just feels dated to me.  

So I'm wondering if I should give Baldur's Gate a try. Is it different enough from Planescape that it might just click better with me,,False,,t5_2sxyv,False,,True

I'm a 23 year old girl

 I had a SNES and a PS1 growing up and only had all of the Donkey Kong and Mario games for SNES; Gex, Harry Potter and Tekken for the PS1. We were poor, I felt grateful just to have the consoles at all. Anyway, I immersed myself in them, and I do love playing video games. 

I never learnt to use joysticks and I have some trouble with them

* I have a SNES again now and don't really know what games to get for it
 
*   I have a Wii but only have New Super Mario Bros, Paper Mario etc. 

* I have a N64 but no games as of yet. I've never played this console

* I have a Gamecube

* I have a PS1 and PS2

* Nintendo DS

* PSP

* Gameboy Advance
* SEGA Genesis

* I didn't mind but didn't particularly like Doom for the PC, Princess Maker, Angry Birds etc and like Facebook gaming (please don't judge!) other than the social aspect.

* Bought a PS3 today because I love playing on my sister-in-laws. Got Heavy Rain, De Blob, Dynasty Warriors: Gundam 3, Little Big Planet and Ratchet and Clank because I had to start a collection somewhere and they all looked interesting. Debated getting Lollipop Chainsaw and Tales of Graces F but decided I was taking enough chances with my money for one day. 


TL;DR - looking for games on a variety of consoles

**My favourite games are Limbo, Heavy Rain, Prince of Persia, Assassins Creed, Bayonetta, Little Big Planet, LA Noire, so please don't leave something out because it seems obvious or 'what everyone says/knows'**

* Nethack: You start with very little, magic rings and amulets, while gathering food to stay alive and carefully considering what to use your potions, wands and scrolls for.  
* Dwarf fortress: You start with only 7 dwarves and a small stockpile. While trying to survive you gather more and more materials to build a nice pimp fortress.  
* Command &amp; Conquer (1): In the harder late game levels, and you are under constant attack. This means you have to prioritize defense, teching up, and fighting for tiberium.  
* Minecraft: In the early game, and try to build a decent stronghold all at the same time as farming food to stay fed. This is way better with for instance industrial craft.

I mean

**My proposal : Cross-Server GvG**


**Why**

There are world-wide a bunch of Guilds who have their focus primarily on World versus World. Most of them like it for the tactics, fighting real wars against real opponents, conquer castles and keeps. Everyone who has ever seen films like LOTR 2 wants to be in the battle of helmsdeep or LOTR 3 the fight for Minas Tirith, where small armies destroy the huge army of Sauron (ok, the army of the undead was a little OP).

I have been in WvW from the start, hate the blobs of +100 people in T1, hate queues, but have to stay in a top 9 tier server to encounter other guilds of the same level and have the epic fights they are thriving for.

As you can see on [www.gw2gvg.com](http://www.gw2gvg.com) there are atm 59 EU-guilds and 39 US-guilds who are organizing their own unofficial GvG’s. This is not that easy because you have to trust the honesty of your opponents, so you will never know who is the strongest guild. Certainly not between US and EU servers.

A possible solution could be guesting a server and then entering WvW, it’s 2 costly after a while, certainly if you have to bring over +30 people every time. People won’t do it and this will result in the death of the GvG-scene or could lead to abuse of external resources (buying ingame money).The only way to really compete at this time is you gather all WvW/GvG-guilds in the same three servers, which means you destroy the WvW on those servers (to much people on it, lags, queues, unplayable


**Proposal**

I propose the making of a Cross-server GvG-structure
The advantage of this project is that you can take several existing elements from other parts of GW2 and adapt them a bit. I will give some examples.

*The score table/leaderboard*

* This is already used in WvW, tPvP. Another list based on these isn’t hard to do

*Terrain options*

* You can make very easy-going terrains. The most beautiful example is the terrain in WvW where the GvG’s are currently held between SE and SW spawn. It has to be mainly open terrain, with the mountain, the water, the little forest and the mill.
* No need for capturing points as the purpose is to just wipe the other team
* That area is precisely right if you look at the size, etc. It doesn’t have to be bigger then that.
* The coliseum of Rome could be a nice setting

*Starting point*

* Something like the PvP-area where you can form your teams. Or something like in GW1 with the guild mansion.
* The people of those teams go and stand on a portal and one person of each party start the countdown for his party.
* You spawn like you do in PvP-arena
* This way you can limit the number of players who join the battle
* Once you enter the portal you get to a spawn point. After the start the spawn point stays open for 30s. If you are not out it closes and you can’t play that round.
* Guild-keeps could be implemented

**Rules**

* To participate you have to be part of the guild (wear the tag + represent)
* Only an officer can start the GvG.
* You have to choose between 15v15 / 20v20 / 25v25. Ofcourse
*You can not go random (perhaps later) you can contact the guild contact who is on the leaderboard next to the guild.
* Only format is death match
* You can choose if stacks received in the fight can be used
* Win = every opponent is dead. First to get 10 wins gains victory in that GvG.

**Advantages**

There are several advantages to implementing this system.

* Less players will be leaving GW2 due to the new challenge.
* Less server switch
* The level of WvW will rise
* Guilds can fight guilds of their own server too.
* There is no real reward. Or nothing especially designed for GvG. It’s for the glory of being the best GvG-guild in the world.

**Possible Expansions**

GvGvGvG

* A map were guilds are all enemy of eachother

I hope A-net reads this plea. Please do make suggestions to improve this idea even more and vote it up if you would love this feature as hard as I do. I don’t mind criticism

One major part of Dark Souls I enjoyed (and enjoy in any game) is that it didn't patronise me. It didn't tell me what I was going up against

Another part of Dark Souls I enjoyed was how deep it was. Something a lot of modern games fail to capture your attention for more than a few months (ahem

I also love difficulty in games. I hate to brag, to be pretty good at Dark Souls. I would not consider myself a ""hardcore"" gamer, but I have found that difficulty is relative. Would Dark Souls be considered hard if all games were as hard as Dark Souls, and it's difficulty was what most people consider today to be normal? No. People would be used to it.

So, as well as Dwarf Fortress (and I would like to hear your comments about it), and I don't really mind exactly how difficult a game is, although difficulty is a bonus. And, no, I am not a masochist, I simply love the feeling of accomplishment after overcoming a huge difficulty. I also dislike a game patronising me.

A group of friends and I are looking for a group game to play on our computers during the upcoming summer break. We'll be across the country - perhaps across the world, but we're keeping ourselves open-minded. We might not all be able to come on at the same time, and there are maybe 10 of us at most.

We could go for a game where we all work together cooperatively towards a goal or where we play competitively against one another; where we play in parallel towards independent or smaller-group goals; where we all play at the same time or where we all play whenever we can get online into some kind of overworld. Not *absolutely* anything

Some ideas that we've come up with

* World of Warcraft/ Other WoW-like MMORPG

* Minecraft

* Pokemon MMO

* League of Legends/Other MOBAs (Heroes of Newerth

* Starcraft: Brood War/ Starcraft 2

* Diablo III/Other action-RPG (Torchlight

* Age of Empires 2 HD/Other ""Age of"" RTSs (Mythology

* Team Fortress 2

* Left 4 Dead/2

* Borderlands 2

* Crusader Kings/Europa Universalis III

* Civilization 5

(I suggested giving Monaco a try, most of the highly competitive games listed above we'd play just amongst ourselves, although we'd of course look into how we fair against other people.)

So what do you think, especially not as a group, and we won't have much time to invest outside of this summer. 

Right now, TF2, and L4D/2 are our top picks. League is also gaining traction. 

*Edit:* Other suggesions:

* SimCity (Mixed feelings about this game, etc. Also, smaller scope compared to previous SimCity's, but we do get multiplayer, eh?)

* Star Wars: The Old Republic

* Terraria

* Monaco (again,False,,t5_2sxyv,1367203951.0,,,t3_1dazxm

**1 - Games that would trigger fear of open water

I have an intense fear of open water to the point that swimming more than a short distance in Skyrim makes my skin crawl, so I'm also interested in any game that would trigger those fears.  

**2 - Psychological horror games**  

Pure gore and jumping scares don't do it for me

**3 - Open world games**  

I have Morrowind, Fallout 3, Fallout NV, GTA VC and SA, and I already know of Far Cry 3. Are there any games I'm missing? Not just for PC, but consoles and handhelds as well.  

**4 - RPGs**  

Bonus points if it's for PSP or a system I can emulate on PSP (mainly SNES

**5 - Games with unique gameplay**  

I only recently got my PSP so I'm discovering all of the neat games for it for the first time - Patapon

**6 - Rhythm games**  

I'm currently hooked on Patapon and Taiko no Tatsujin Portable DX. What other rhythm games are out there? I've played all of the Rhythm Heaven games.
