It doesn't require you to respond here but I believe that the message needs to be loud and clear that he has finished his tenure as moderator.

Edit - I have some commitments to take care of tonight so I'm out soon. But I'll check in when I can with my phone. Also

Edit 2 - will continue this tomorrow when I wake up

Edit 3 - Here's some common questions coming up:

Q:What is the top thing every passenger should know?

A: Please have your fare/pass ready BEFORE you board. A LOT of times buses run late because we'll have a number of passengers get on the bus

Q: Why do buses come two at a time?

A: It's a phenomenon called bus platooning. And especially with trolleys
What we try to do is get all the people waiting at the stop to board the second bus as it will mean the first bus will have less people to drop off and possibly catch up some time. However, meaning that the first bus will not stop at a stop if no one needs to get off, knowing that the second bus is just right behind or a few seconds behind. Unfortunately this just pisses off a lot of people who simply just dont look behing to see the second bus, they just assume the driver did not pick them up. I've seen a lot of middle digits because of this :( Sorry folks!

Q: Fare Evasion

A: If i tried to enforce everything and get in arguments with passengers, so it's best to keep going. There are drivers out there (just as people in any job), who take things too personally, or try to be hard-ass. That's their prerogative, just not mine.

Honestly, my transfer just expired (4 hours go), I don't have any cash, etc.

Dear landlords of Vancouver:

I know it's difficult for you. You are all just hardworking people struggling to maintain your right to have someone else pay the mortgage, there are a few things that I think might be helpful in your noble endeavour, and I'd like to pass them on in solidarity:

1. A closet is not a den. If it doesn't have a window, or more than ten square feet of space, it is not a den. 

2. A den is not a bedroom. Even if your second, it is not a second bedroom.

3. ""Separate entrance"" is not a selling feature of an apartment. If it does not have a separate entrance, and ""full kitchen.""

4. Burnaby is not Vancouver. It is not East Vancouver. It is not Commercial Drive, and Assmunch, Arizona are also not Vancouver. Most prospective tenants will clue in to this when you give them the address.

5. It's logically impossible to be 5 minutes' walk from Renfrew Station

6. Granville Street is not ""right next to"" or ""just west of"" Main Street.

7. If your rental space is within ten feet of a major artery, or Kingsway, it is not quiet. Can't hear what I'm saying? It is NOT QUIET.

8. ""Cozy"" and ""small"" and ""cramped"" all have different definitions

9. A basement suite is a basement suite. A garden level suite is a basement suite. A ground floor suite is a basement suite. An ""almost above ground"" ground floor suite is a basement suite.

10. Laminate flooring is not hardwood. Laminate is plastic. Hardwood is wood. Hence

11. You can have ONE damage deposit

12. A ""bathroom"" is a place with a toilet, *walls*, and *a door*. If you are tempted to call something that does not meet this definition a ""bathroom"", take a moment to clarify in your ad that it is a toilet in the middle of the bedroom, or using more traditional phraseology, an ""open pit latrine.""

13. If one cannot see the mountains/ocean or other advertised geographic features by looking out the window

14. There is no such thing as ""one mouse

15. Landlords, but please know that it is not your tenants' responsibility to paint or repair your rental space. This is part of your job, because you collect the rental income. It's a new concept to you, I know, but should be fairly easy to remember if you consider the logic of it. When the happy day comes that your tenant owns her own living space, *then* she can do her own repairs and maintenance.

16. ""Old"" is not ""heritage."" It is not even ""character""

17. Try to keep your word about showing times. If you make an appointment with prospective tenants

18. No means no. If I have decided not to rent your poorly maintained, gorgeous almost-top-floor basement suite, with two bedrooms and a den, with peek a boo views, just next to granville island at the quiet intersection of hastings and boundary, *please* do not contact me again by email or phone to persuade me that your rental suite is amazing. I am not looking for a new friend who collects rent, I am looking for a decent place to live.

The moderator [mcantelon](http://www.reddit.com/user/mcantelon/comments/) however has reinstated those accounts, and that down-votes alone are the only correct tool to deal with racism, misogyny, abusive behaviour, impostures, and other behaviors not allowed in well-run and respected subs.

I propose that we start a campaign that demands liquor law reform of the sort that matters to ordinary British Columbians.

What are some examples of what I want?

1.  I want to be able to take a bottle of wine or a beer on a picnic with my wife and not risk being hasseled or getting a ticket.  I am a responsible adult

2.  I want a store like the modern bartender

3.  I want a bar that has a video game theme to be able to also serve alcohol.

I propose that we develop a liquor reform campaign for the upcoming provincial election that targets people who may not otherwise vote. We keep it dead simple and provide an easy to engage with issue.  “Do you want to be able to drink a beer at the beach? If yes

How do I envision the campaign working? The first step is probably a youtube video that sets out exactly what we’re after in one minute or less. Using the video and word of mouth, if you commit to making these demands a priority if you’re elected, we will send our supporters your way. 

The way I see it

I’ve started a Beer on the Beach Facebook page (https://www.facebook.com/BeerAtTheBeach) as a place to organize a first meeting. ‘Like it’

What I found

I was passed probably upwards of 100-200 times on the ~45 minute drive. I did not keep pace with any vehicle I could see on the road

Every car on the road was driving 100+ in 80 zones

I felt more than a little unsafe driving the legal limit; I was being passed on the left for the most part

A lot(50%

I was almost rear-ended/sideswiped(Driving straight

There were a couple actual speeders(Given the average speed on this highway is obviously 10-20km/h above the legal speed

So, the highway is not much different. It's been a while since I've driven out past that to say, Hope, so I don't remember the highway there well enough to say with confidence.), as low as they are? All it's doing is making the vast majority driving it be constantly breaking the law, and driving unsafely with those who are following the law due to the speed difference. To say nothing of the ridiculousness of speeding fines and the 40km/h over impound laws, just for keeping up with sane traffic and being part of the majority. The highway is easily safe enough for 120km/h.

",26,79,http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/19c7jf/dealing_with_depression_a_vancouver_guide/,"
Hi all

I've been dealing with depression on-and-off for years now

Let's face it

**Step 1: Finding a counsellor**

This can be the most overwhelming part

*If you live in Vancouver:* Call the Adult Mental Health Intake line at 604-675-3997. Tell them that you are looking for a counselling referral. They will take your details (Name

Alternatively

*If you live in the suburbs:* I don't have first-hand experience here

Some of these programs will require a referral from a doctor. If you don't have a regular family doctor

Note: if you are nervous about phoning these offices... don't be! I know I was

**Step 2: Antidepressants?**

Man, find a doctor you can see again on a semi-regular basis for your follow-up appointments. I know this isn't necessarily possible if you are going to a walk-in clinic, so see if you can find a permanent physician in your neighbourhood (I know, I know, easier said than done...)

**Step 3: Talk to your friends and family**

Honestly, but only started telling my friends and family this past month. It was the emotional version of coming out-of-the-closet for me. And do you know what? It's the greatest thing I've ever done. 

I understand why we chose not to share depression with others, it will make your bonds that much stronger. If you have trouble explaining to people what depression is exactly, I highly recommend sharing with them this lecture by Standford's Robert Sapolsky: [Stanford's Sapolsky On Depression in U.S.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOAgplgTxfc)

**What's next?**

Congratulate yourself on taking the first steps in dealing with depression... facing it can be one of the most daunting tasks, and it's going to take a lot of time and a lot of work to overcome it. That said, always remember this: **you will beat it, and you're not alone**.

At Phibbs Exchange [this man](http://i.imgur.com/AIQPd.jpg) sat next to me on the 232 Grouse Mountain bus. He seemed to be putting an excessive amount of pressure on me with his left arm, while continuing to apply pressure. Then later around 23rd and Lonsdale he crept his right hand over to my thigh while looking straight ahead, not acknowledging what he was doing. When I pulled the cord to get off on Queens Rd(Around the Delbrook Rec-Center), I said ""Excuse me"" to get to the door, he got off at the same stop. At first he turned left at the sidewalk as I turned right. I look back, and he's facing me and not moving. I start to walk a little faster. I turn back again and he is still staring, but now he was following me. I decide not to go home


A few weeks later, and the man that fit the description was sitting next to him, putting pressure against him with his arm. 


And tonight

 A year ago, somewhere between Granville and Seymour (IIRC). He was panicking, was wearing a black t shirt and grey jeans. He told me this story about how he was visiting his long distance girlfriend, and that she had thrown him out without letting him get his things. He said he lived in Whistler, didn't know anyone here, and that he needed money to get to, at least Squamish, I had just moved to Vancouver, I gave him the money to buy him a bus ticket. We exchanged phone numbers

 This dude stops me in the street today, he'd ducked into the subway. Like I said, I don't particularly care about the money, it wasn't that much. 

 He was just one block down from where he stopped me last time, I don't particularly care if he's caught or not. I'm the guy who wouldn't bat an eye if I saw someone looking for help. Before any of you say it, I realize how stupid that is. And yeah, maybe I deserved being taken advantage of for being so fucking stupid.

I totally understand wanting to stay away from traffic and how it *feels* safer to be on the sidewalk, and slow moving pedestrians on the sidewalk/crosswalk.  Even in the cases where there are no trees / newspaper boxes / etc. hiding you, you're much less visible on the sidewalk simply because motorists *aren't expecting to see you there*.  The human brain is very bad at seeing things it's not looking for (as evidenced by the famous ""invisible gorilla"" experiment).

I half-assedly tried to organize an r/Vancouver votes crew to help take first time voters to the polls during (I think) the last federal election. Here's my attempt to do a bit better.

Is anyone interested in helping to take a voter or five to the polls either on Election Day or to the advance polls?

I figure people can post their voting districts in the comments and then new voters can buddy up and each voting district can have a group of voters head to the polls (or district office if people want to vote any day before Election Day).

You can find out where your closest polling place is by visiting the [Elections BC website](www.elections.bc.ca/ge2013/#whereAndWhenToVote). You can also find out who the candidates are in your riding.

I'll start: I'm in Vancouver-Fairview.

He told me he was an avid game player since the days of original Nintendo. His wife and him would play Nintendo until 2-3am in the morning. She didn't want to play the games but loved to sit and watch him play and experience it with him. He explained how he would often get frustrated with the puzzle parts of games and how she would talk him through it and help him complete them, and he takes his time and completes them. His wife died about three years ago and he didn't continue playing video games.
He recently acquired a PlayStation 2 from a friend of his and has been trying to play through the resident evil series but was hopelessly stuck on the puzzles and didn't know what to do. Him and I spent a little time looking online and found a strategy guide to print out. I have never seen someone so overjoyed about a strategy guide, he brought the hugest smile to my face.
TLDR : Old guy and his wife love gaming. (Most people suggest you should take a minute out of your day and read it anyways)

[UPDATE]
The man came in again this morning. One of the puzzles in the guide didn't make sense to him. He joked about calling the Nintendo hotline after all these years saying that the guy would say ""holy f*ck, [he agreed](http://i.imgur.com/pXvBk.jpg) . He is holding the picture of his wife that he carries in his wallet. I am holding the page of the IGN guide he brought in (that we printed out yesterday), that he had scribbled random numbers all over trying to sort out the puzzle. He then excitedly rushed to his scooter and tore off to open the music box on the wall in RE: Code Veronica.
I won't be posting every update about this guy on Reddit. I will post them on my [facebook](http://www.facebook.com/nickervision) though. If I've set it correctly

The food was okay and the drinks weren't too pricey. That being said

I WILL say

The all ages thing really curbs the mood. One of the waiters there was even telling me they have to be really choosy even about the music that they play because of this

The owner was there, which totally redeemed everything. lol.

They really gotta work on the video games thing though, imo. 


EDIT: Signed the petition someone posted. After reading more in depth about the travesty they're going through

EDIT: I sort of get the impression that if they went the route of a liquor primary place things might have been a little easier for them. Is it a far stretch to say theres plenty of places that have the digital slots / booze bar and it works out? I think them going for an ""all ages"" venue complicates the whole thing, thats bound to be a disaster. You can't have your cake, and eat it too. Then again, maybe I just don't know what I'm talking about. Perhaps the owner thought that making it ""all ages"" means he'll turn more of a profit with the kids in there spending money.

But we let it go.

I paid the 300 deductible to get my window fixed

The next Wednesday, and going straight for my mailbox (1 out of maybe 50 in the building). My gf sees the video the next day, and immediately identifies them as people she saw at the restaurant a week ago.

We go to the restaurant

RCMP says they can't do anything about it. The officer now has both the tapes from the restaurant and my strata. I have the tapes from the restaurant but only has seen the footage from the strata. Strata company refuses to give it to me

Nothing has been done. I spoke to a few different constables and they basically said that even if they go public

They also told us that we shouldn't expect anything to happen. Even if they're caught, the replacements costs for her wallet.

It has been 3 weeks now.

I have so much details about it all. Video tapes

What do I do??

EDIT: Just to vent a little: the most frustrating thing about this is that their faces are on camera perfectly. Their faces are so distinctive I could pick them out from a line up of a million people. And yet the police are telling me they most likely won't be able to ID them.

And guess what time they waltzed into my building to break into the mail box? 3pm.

EDIT2: http://i.imgur.com/ZuxxQsX.jpg

EDIT3: So I just spoke with my gf
1. speak to our case officer and let him know that we're not satisfied with the way/speed things are being handled by the RCMP and give him a heads up that we want to speak to a lawyer even if it's at our cost
2. speak to a lawyer about possible action to get the strata to give us the tape
3. ask the lawyer if we would be in the wrong if we went to the media
4. go to the media with the story and if we feel it's appropriate

I can't believe I didn't think to post something here earlier. On January 7th, too) made off with my hockey bag, which I'd actually totally forgotten I'd left in there.

I've been scouring Craigslist since then, or see anyone trying to sell gear matching the list below, please, **please** let me know.

- Winnwell wheeled bag
- CCM helmet w/ Bauer half-visor
- CCM skates
- Bauer One35 shoulder pads
- Bauer elbow pads
- Easton gloves
- Black RBK practice jersey
- Capitals Ovechkin WC jersey that's missing the patch
- Pair of red + blue + white stripes

Don't recall what my pants were, so don't put a high priority on that. I probably had another jersey in there, and definitely had a second pair of socks. Jock shorts, stick tape, mouthguard, the usual. I've only used it all maybe a dozen times, so the gear is in pretty good condition.

The assholes also made off with my fiancée's longboard, because it was my first Christmas present to her.

***[Follow up Thread is here!](http://www.reddit.com/r/vancouver/comments/hzj1s/alright_rvancouver_global_reddit_meetup_day_and/)***

*** The official page is [Here](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/vancouver-meetup/)!*** You can RSVP on it too. The time and location are not officially set but for now I just put Spanish Banks. NOTE: there is another event already made but it has nothing to do with this thread

Okay so here are the main suggestions so far --- since there are quite a bit of redditors not 19 yet

* Have a bbq at a beach or park. Hopefully it will be warm and sunny and it would be a shame if we spent the day indoors on a nice day. Spanish Banks seems like a great place to hang out. This seems like the best idea now.

* Go to a pub/bar. This is ideal if the weather will not favour outdoor events. A lot of people have recommended Steamworks. Apparently its all ages so that's a bonus

So please feel free to add more suggestions! This looks very promising right now. Closer to the event

NOTE: please remember reddiquette

We checked into the hotel and decided to go out for a walk to find something for lunch

It didn't take long for me to notice a few things about Vancouver:

* you like bicycles
* you like dogs
* you like coffee
* you like gelato
* you really hate cars

We did one of those hop-on/hop-off trolly's and got to see quite a bit of the city; places like Stanley Park, we even made our way up to the Capilano suspension bridge.

There was a nice food selection; the Beaver and the Mullet near Denman and Davie made a good grilled cheese and fantastic mac 'n cheese. Just a bit to the south we had some amazing fish and chips at The Boat House. On the flip side, the schwarma, and the philo were nothing special, as was the Old Spaghetti Factory in Gastown. We grabbed a few burgers at Nimby Burger and went across the street to the Kitsilano beach/park to enjoy the beautiful weather. There was another really good burger place, which I am pretty sure was on ~~Granville St~~ nope, ~~don't remember the name~~ Romer's, the burgers were pretty good but service was a bit lacking (Romer's Burger Bar on 4th, which was exceptional.

After not receiving the deposit back after a month and a half I called the building manager and received a phone number for the ""head office"". I tried calling the number probably 15 times over 1 month and all I got was voicemail that was full so I couldn't even leave a message.

Then began the long and somewhat complicated process of trying to get my deposit back which included:

* Filing a case with the Residential Tenancy Branch ($50)
* Winning the case (which was a conference call that the land lord didn't bother calling in for) for $1000
* Having the official order for $1000 ignored by the land lord
* Performing a company records search ($44.80)
* Filing my $1000 order with the small claims court ($21)
* Serving 4 copies of the Payment Hearing court documents on the defendants ($168)
* Receiving a certified cheque for $1145.80 at the Payment Hearing with an additional $43.20 to me mailed to me
* Finally receiving the cheque for $43.20 in the mail today to put this issue to rest.

Finally receiving my money after going through this process is a relief but the process really shouldn't take this long or be as complicated as it is. I ended up spending many hours of my time serving documents, and constantly trying to figure out what the next steps would be.

As the title stated

I would like someone to meet me at a train station downtown, and whatever travel time the person requires. I don't have a lot of money, but I'd be happy to give $20 for the help.

The ring will be in the basket, if nothing comes up. The meeting would take place shortly after 3:00pm.

Would anyone be able to help me with this? Thank you.

tl;dr: I would like someone to hand me a basket at 3:00pm tomorrow

Edit: Thank you again to everyone who so kindly offered to help, and I have found someone to help. Sorry to those whom I did not reply to. You all seemed kind and friendly, and I assure you it was nothing personal. I can post an update tomorrow describing how it went, and I'll try to, but don't expect anything too exciting :P

Edit 2: It's done! It went ok. No, and it went off without a hitch. She accepted, and was pretty floored by the whole thing. She was a bit suspicious about the mysterious package delivery (which was a bag, since apparently stores don't sell picnic baskets in winter), but the suspicion did not detract from the experience.

You've all been very kind, fairy tales, mysteries, and the water. So, inside the basket of food I placed some handwritten notes from ""The Picnic Wizard"", giving his history and explaining how he bestows picnic baskets upon special, worthy couples. It's a bit sappy, but works well for the situation. We took the basket to the sea wall, so that we may continue to spread and grow the magic of happiness and picnics.

It was fun, and to my excellent helper in particular, for making it a great afternoon and an extremely memorable experience :)

1369636897.0,1f4j2w,My experience in a float tank in Vancouver,ygjb,92,22,37,"TLDR: went into an isolation tank

About two weeks ago my brother in law called and told us about a new place that opened in Vancouver. After discussing it briefly

The process was pretty straightforward; after missing my first appointment due to a surprise meeting, if you have visited any treatment place, such as chiropractic, massage, or physiotherapy, they get you to sign similar forms). You are strongly encouraged to use the rest-room, then take a shower at a neutral temperature to clean yourself before entering the tank. Entering the tank was super simple, if there was, but not both

Entering the tank was interesting because with one foot in the water, I could immediately sense the buoyancy provided by the saltwater. After spending a couple of moments getting used to the fact that I was lying in the tank, I closed the door. It was completely dark in the chamber, but I could hear more than I expected, with the combination of the ear plugs, and being in a closed space, inside of a much larger facility. I waited a few minutes to make sure I was actually hearing sounds and that they weren't 'ghost' sounds that my mind was filling in because of the lack of noise, but I can't clearly speak to how long because my sense of time was completely gone yfairly quickly. It was really interesting to experiment with how I could move in the water in a different way

There was another thing I noticed fairly quickly too. Despite living in an area of the world best describe as a temperate rain forest that gets it's share of rain, my skin is frequently dry to the point of cracking, especially on my hands(I haven't been diagnosed with any issues, and it is not irritating enough to invest significant time or effort beyond skin lotion). Seconds after entering the water I felt a slight sting in every scrape, scratch and crack in my skin (there are afew as I have been doing yard work and other stuff). It didn't hurt, but it was definitely noticeable. It subsided after a few minutes, and was overall

I was alone with my thoughts and feelings and eventually my awareness of my senses was altered as well. As with any environment, but it became cringe-worthy after hearing it a few times. I made a mental note to get things in my foot checked out, and then tried to avoid moving my foot to prevent the distraction.

Some time into it, and was completely surprised a couple of times because I had the sensation of moving in one direction and would be drifting the opposite way. When that got boring I stabilized my self and settled for awhile.

After about 80 minutes I realized that I was finished, got some salt water in my eyes. In the Caribbean ocean the salt water feels pretty good. In an isolation tank, not so much. No harm done, but the stinging took about a minute to subside.

Fast forward 9 hours to when I am writing this post, I had a nice coating of salt (I assume stuff that was absorbed into the pores). Overall, the experience was very good, and left me feeling extremely relaxed.

Since having done the float

*edit - put the tldr at the top of the wall of text.

A note on fear and confrontation: I have a few phobias, heights, crowds, spiders (I might be the only appsec person who hates spiders :P). Claustrophobia is a bad one for me. I won't go into the reasons why, but I don't like being in closed spaces, and even meeting rooms, or being in a room where there is a person blocking the exit is very disconcerting. Performing this activity is part of my ongoing effort to challenge myself to overcome fears and understand why I fear. I don't recommend this as a regular course of activity for anyone who suffers from claustrophobia because this helped me understand that my fear of being confined has less to do with the space and more to do with feeling trapped or contained.

1314295260.0,ju8ta,Bus etiquette,airchinapilot,94,26,170,"There was a recent thread on umbrella etiquette and now that people are coming back from vacation and going to school and work

1. Take that fucking backpack off your back. You don't realize it but you are bashing everyone in the face when you turn around and you are taking up more than one person's space. Ladies with your oversized chichi handbag
2. Good hygiene is good. **EDIT** *I have heard the points from people working in construction. I have worked in a warehouse before. I was not referring to you but understand. Also people who just came from the beach
3. Those seats up near the front? Give them up for people who need them. Old people, really dangerous mentally ill people -- give them two seats. 
4. That space around the rear exits. Don't block that fucking space. I know it's a pain when you think you just need to stay there for two stops or whatever
5. Headphones  / earphones -- are meant to be heard in silence. If I can hear the words of the song
6. Umbrellas -- don't drip it on me. Put it on the floor or at least hold onto it lower. **EDIT** Don't put wet things on the seats! People have to sit there!
7. That seat next to you is for a human being
8. If you are going to grope your friend in front of me
9. Lady with the big fruit basket on your head. Keep on rocking that. I don't mind. 
10. iPads -- don't look at your fucking hentai. That shit is open where everyone can see it and I don't want to see your greasy tentacle rape fantasy before I've had my coffee. 
11. Lady who was making her sandwich on her lap: don't wipe your greasy hands on the pole. Better yet
12. Perverts. You've seen them. Report them. Use the phone. 
13. Advice. You know the bus routes
14. Phones and loud talkers. I give up
15. Bus drivers. Be nice to them.
16. You have an awful cold: Use the tissues, just keep your cold virus away from everyone else. 
17. Mommies with strollers. If your kid can stand or sit, you do. Give up that space or take the next bus.
18. **added** You don't want to sit at the window? Okay
19. **added** Have your fare ready. Especially with the rainy months about to happen
20.  **added**  Know when you're getting off and plan accordingly. In other words
21.  **added** Don't clip your fucking nails on the fucking bus. It is never
22.  **added** Skytrain: Don't block doors when people are trying to get off. If you're on the train and by the doors
23.   **added** If you're sitting in the back in those 2 by 2 seats which face each other, do what you can. 
24.   **added** Standing room only and your friend gets a seat upfront- OK
25. **added** If you leave trash on the bus
26. **added** if I'm sitting next to the window and you're sitting next to me, I wanna get off. It would be nice if you moved, if you don't want me to shove my ass in your face.
27. **added** Do not block the exit. Stand to the side and let people off before trying to cram yourself on board. Yes, you are actually slowing things down, and making it more likely that a) someone gets trapped on the bus/train and misses their stop and b) someone behind you doesn't make it on because the doors closed on them.
28. **added** If you need to put your bike on the bike rack at the front and it's empty put it in the back one first. It's a lot easier to get a bike off from this position then get one on if there is a bike in the front space.
29. **added** Do not hold the SkyTrain doors open for more than 6 attempts
30. **added** Don't bug the service dogs. They are cute but they are working.

Tell her where you read this post so she knows the word about supporting local farmers is getting out there! 

Thanks everyone and have a great summer! 

Prices are two dollars more per dozen than out in Chilliwack

Look for the signs

It's really bothering me that the cyclist was so jaded by the lack of  interest he perceives on part of the police that he just drove off.  It seems ridiculous that those people will now possibly just be able to continue on with no consequence for HITTING A HUMAN BEING WITH THEIR CAR. 

Update: The police called me back and said the best they could do is give me the number to ICBC to name myself as a witness in the event that the person who got hit contacts them and is looking for one.

1319155956.0,ljbxp,Lost our dog in Lynn Valley last night :(,vancookalex,70,4,31,"Hey r/vancouver

We were at a house with a fenced-in yard in North Van, we went on a hunt until it was too dark. We've followed all the necessary steps, including calling the local shelters, vets, RCMP and animal control. Today, we've gone around putting up posters and handed them out, making sure to go door to door and hitting the trails in the area. 

Betty's a 1.5 year old greyhound cross, with white around her neck, chest and legs. She has a black collar on with our phone numbers attached. She's very shy, so she might be difficult to approach. If you spot her, please let me know through e-mail at vancookalex@gmail.com. 

Here's a decent picture of her:
http://i.imgur.com/rpliv.jpg

Let me know if there is anything else I could pursue! Thanks...

EDIT: Thank you for the offers of help so far! Here is the link to the poster we've been using: http://www.scribd.com/doc/69675371/Betty-Lost

EDIT 2: We now have a tracker helping us tomorrow morning! He's got a bloodhound who has experience in tracking other animals. I'll let you guys know how it goes.

UPDATE: We've now met with the tracker from Petsearchers Canada. Brought his bloodhound Jed, and they end up complicating things further. So we wait, for now. 

UPDATE 2: Just got a tip from someone who saw her last night around Mountain Highway and Doran

UPDATE 3: We waited all day for the tracker to come back, this morning, he sent an email to our adoption coordinator (who got us in touch with this guy) telling her that he spent around 6 hours searching in the northern part of Mountain Highway, to no avail. He recommended a different type of poster be put up, fluorescent with a laser printout of Betty's picture, and writing in jumbo marker. I have to work today, but my girlfriend will be out putting them up in the area around Mountain Highway and Dyck/Doran/Kilmer

UPDATE 4: Got 2 tips last night, filled with bramble bushes and a big drop down to the creek bed, but it may be possible to take one of the trails down there and follow the creek down, which we're going to attempt today!

Here's a map of the area we now believe she's around
