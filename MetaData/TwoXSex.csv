Each time (including the instances that were in a committed relationship) was met with disgust

So I feared the very same when he started initiating sexy times in bed one morning a few days ago. I recently got an IUD installed and my period has been somewhat unpredictable/mostly spotting

Then he says something that may not be a big deal to all of you but to me

He nonetheless sees I'm a little uncomfortable with it so we move to the shower for a while. Then back to bed once we remembered the newtonian limitations of shower sex for us. For some reason doggy style has tended to not be messy at all in the past so, we start with that, but then proceed with all the usual positions anyway and he finishes like normal. I still tell him not to look down as he pulls out but he gets up to get a towel, cleans himself off with a single swipe, and tosses the towel to me. 

And says again, you know.""** 

So, my last relationship was emotionally abusive in some ways and this incident reminded me how quickly I was led to agree that this was something gross that I should be ashamed of and try to prevent. I'd obviously never force period sex on someone who wasn't comfortable with it, but I think had I not spent 2 years in deference to a total fuckwit, I would've initially been as indifferent to it as my current boyfriend is.

To make things worse, and by the time we needed to leave, there was no way to see my doctor (the appointment would have taken 6 days anyway). 

So here I am in a car with all my friends in horrible pain, and nothing worked or seemed to make it better in any way. Finally I called my doctor and told her about my situation and because she is awesome she wrote my a prescription for antibiotics to pick up in the next town AND told me the best news of my life: baking soda relieves all symptoms of a UTI by the next time you pee after you consume it.

At first I thought it was strange

I'm not sure how common this knowledge is, or any of the other women I've told, but I swear I went from a level 8 discomfort to a level 0. It was so nice, I literally cried.

And I just wanted to share that with you in case you don't know. Keep in mind that baking soda has A LOT of sodium in it, and the relief doesn't last forever, and I've only heard of it actually curing a UTI from one or two women so consider this an early treatment and a good hold over until your doc can get your meds. Also, baking soda taste absolutely nasty, and my doctor told me to also take some Vitamin C to balance out the acid and alkaline levels in my body.

Hope this helps and if any of you try it

So, I understand that it can be a big undertaking to take on a role like that.


We always have pretty amazing sex, my panties were basically soaked. We got back to his house and had dinner (we were hungry and couldn't wait, haha), and after it was seriously one amazing sexual experience after the other.


We recently discovered that I go absolutely nuts when he plays with that really sensitive spot on my clit (the little bead-type thing under the hood), covered my mouth, and whispered in my ear something to the effect of ""You're gonna have to be quiet."" in seriously the sexiest voice of my life. (I don't remember the exact wording, I was basically in ecstasy at that point.) He went for it hard, deep, and fast, and he ended up pressing my face into the pillow to keep me quiet. I could feel him pressing his chest against my back and breathing into my ear ""You like that?"" 


I had one of the best orgasms I've EVER had in my life. Afterwards I ended up just holding him, and we even ended up cumming together. I feel so incredibly happy and amazed and just had to share!

Early in the relationship, and once they went further, I started losing interest. I eventually started faking orgasms, which I finally confessed to him and he said he didn't want that. He suggested buying a vibrator, and we did, and things turned way around. I never faked it again. 

Then he graduated and went to grad school in another state. Almost as soon as that happened, but I always fall short. He would fall asleep because I don't know how to initiate, or whatever. Then, I would get more and more anxious because it wasn't happening, and I'd put more pressure on myself, and it just got worse and worse. I'd be sitting there trying to get turned on because I felt like I *should,* and I know that's not a good way to manage it.

Now, and never has been. I've talked to him about it repeatedly during our relationship, but things only ever got marginally better, and then he falls back into bad habits. Things aren't a total slobberfest anymore, but it's still not any good. Let me describe.

He places his lips on mine, mouths closed. I'd try to change it up, but if I even part my lips, his tongue is IN MY MOUTH ALL THE WAY AND THERE IT STAYS. It's awful. I find myself dreading his sexual advances, because it inevitably involves kissing, and the kissing is just a nightmare.

The problem is this: We started having fantastic sex for about 2 years. He's the only man who was able to make me have an orgasm just from penetration. But I've been gradually losing my sex drive to the point that it now pretty much grosses me out. Not just with him

He's been saying for months that if he doesn't have more sex (we've been having sex about once a week) he just can't stay with me. He's very attractive and I love his penis. I sometimes fantasize during the day about seeing him at night and having sex

Last night again he tried to initiate sex. I tried to go along with it but I was not feeling anything good and almost got into it but just couldn't. The worst part is  that I am a sort of saliva-phobe and my body is dry for some reason. So he uses saliva and that completely turns me off. I've mentioned this to him but he hates Astroglide or KY.

It's heartbreaking, he said he was sad. I said me too. I said can we meet tonight? I want to make love. But he is not believing it anymore, he just looked at me sadly and said, ""I thought about this last night; I couldn't sleep. We need to talk but this is not the moment, I have to go to work.""

Is there a way to make yourself interested in sex again? I should point out that I have been going through depression. First my mom got sick, so that might have something to do with my issues.

I'm terrified of being in a sexless or low-sex relationship. It's seriously one of my worst fears.

1353960450.0,13tuom,My boyfriend is afraid of my sexuality.,scarysexythrowaway,48,4,42,"Hello ladies. I'm pretty frustrated about this; I've never experienced this before. Here goes.

Background Info:

Me: I like sex. Once a day, I've had numerous boyfriends, I've contracted HSV-2 (don't judge, I tell all sex partners). I will tell a man what I want and need, which is primarily oral sex to get me off. I've been masturbating since age 4 so the clit is it; internal penetration feels nice but does not produce orgasm. Every man I sleep with who knows of my situation has had no problem giving me oral first before penetrative intercourse (I have a history of denying my own pleasure and not asking for oral, so now I make sure men know). I enjoy giving oral as well and being adventurous, trying out new things.

SO: From the southern US

He and I have been dating for two months, but still. I've talked about it with him numerous times and he calls me a sex addict for wanting to sleep with him. Somehow he doesn't seem to understand that sex is a mutual experience, which means I get off too. I've cried to him more than a few times about this, and he'll go down on me that day, but the next day things will go back to the way they were before. He said he thinks about me in a sexual way every day but I guess doesn't feel like acting on it. 

I'm pretty sure SO's go-to method of initiating sex with me is we will be lying in bed and he'll put my hand on his erection. I've started ignoring that when he does it. One of his favorite tricks, before he knew of my condition) were not like this! The other night, we hadn't had sex in a week due to my period (other dudes have had no issue laying a towel down or giving oral with a tampon in). I was settling in to go to sleep when he casually stated that he was going to masturbate. Huh? He asked if I just wanted him to ""pound it out"", I was so desperate for intimacy I agreed. When he came over to me he immediately tried penetrating me without even getting me wet first. But why bother putting in the work to coax out my natural lubrication when we can just use astroglide? It felt great and when it was over I couldn't help but start to cry--he had NO intention of finishing me off too. It's like my pleasure is not important to him at all. And then, due to the shitty lubrication, the next day I experienced the start of a painful weeklong outbreak. 

For him to go down on me I usually have to start on him and then turn it into a 69. And on top of it all

I have two main theories: 1. my brazen liberal sexuality scares him; and 2. my HSV-2 scares him. He's admitted to the second theory but not the first (yet he has no problem never using a condom). We sleepover every day

Today I got off from a 24 hour shift at work. I masturbated when I got home. SO came to see me later

I'm going to see my parents next month. I'll be gone for three weeks. He told me not to masturbate that whole time. 

His perspective whenever I bring sex up is that he doesn't want to be like all the other guys I dated who ONLY wanted to sleep with me. Also

Has anyone experienced something like this? What do I do?

1369457401.0,1f0kcy,I don't know what to feel in this situation or what to do.,Khet88,47,9,13,"Hello Ladies. 
I write mu first post here, please post that. This might be a longer story, but I think it's required to get how I feel.

Three weeks ago, we have a frind in common. He had been making some passes at me during my worknight, but I just dismissed that as I always do, drunk guys iften hit on everything with a pulse within a 600 m radius. The rape in itself was horrible, but it wasn't anything close to the clusterfuck of feelings that came around in my head afterwards. 
I knew that I should have called the police afterwards, or whether it was really rape, the thought that my muslim family would know (my parents aren't very religious, but other parts of my family are), the potential court case, everying just overwhelmed me and I did the only thing I could think of was running home, throw all my clothes away and get into the shower to scrub myself as clean as possible for more than an hour while crying like mad. At that time I couldn't stand being alone anymore, let's call him Robert, so we never have of eachother in a romantic way, and almost tried to physically drag me out of the apartment

Then after a few weeks, but I could go through the day without thinking off it. It felt as if I had just been in an unfortunate carcrash, and I was just becomming better. Everything went good. 

Until I last night saw the guy again at work. I was almost ready to both scream and puke at the same time, why did he do that? I asked our friend we had in common what had happend to him. He answered:"" some psycopath with a baseballbat beat his crotch to a pulp. Weirdly enough he doesn't want the police involved, he kept saying to the nurses that he had just crashed on his motorbike""

It didn't take me many seconds to realize what had happened, but it was missing from its usual corner next to the main door in his apartment last time I was there). Robert had beaten this guy up in his own way of justice. I wasn't surprised that he could do it, he has served two tours in Afghanistan, but I was shocked that he did it. He has never been violent around me, or generally anyone here back home. He always says that the law is the most important thing to uphold, but this made him put his high principles on the backburner.  

So now I guess that it comes to all of the questions I have:
What should I feel? 
I am in a way very happy that this guy who raped me has gotten a sort of punishment. But it also feels wrong to be happy about vigilantism. 

And I am scared for Robert

I feel scared that the asshole would want at some point in the future to hurt me again

I am scared of my family finding all of this out

I feel weirdly safe by having a friend that would probably take a bullet for me without hesistation. 

I feel guilty that my situation has made it so that Robert felt that it was necessary for him to put himself in his situation. Then again Robert has said this to me many times over the last three weeks ""You're only responsible for your own actions"". I thought that was meant to prevent me from perhaps feeling I was responsible for the rape, if only I had pulled myself together to go to the police just after, he wouldn't have done anything.

I am weirdly and utterly angry at my best friend though more than 20 years, his fiancee is pregnant, and they need him. I am angry that someone so smart could do something so utterly egoistic and stupid. His fiancee knows everything of what has happened, except I guess one slight thing....

And perhaps worst of all
 
I also know that I should probably talk to a psychiatrist about this, but my agressor could certainly prove the assault on him.

What else should I do? 

Thanks in advance.

PS: I'm not worried about pregnancies or STDs

PPS: i live in a Scandinavian country, in case this actually story makes the news.

1362432221.0,19ntw7,RANT: i'm that bitch who doesn't like small dicks and it's making me miserable-- please advise/comfort/commiserate. thank you.,sadsizequeen,50,13,34,"Let me start by reiterating the fact that I feel terrible about this-- so please go easy on me.

I am a late 20s lady and I am very confident when it comes to sex and dating. I know what I want in a guy and if I see it I go for it. The only thing that seems to really shake my confidence and continually keep me from finding a new LTR (something I've been looking for for about four years now)... is that even when everything else is awesome, I get nothing out of it.

Of course I've tried! I've slept with a lot of guys with small penises-- and not just one night stands, me on top, him on top, various leg angles-- whatever. I've also tried just having them use my vibe on me or have them watch or just hold me while I vibe myself or oral, fingering, like really... I feel like I have truly done everything I could think of to stay satisfied with a small guy.

But unfortunately, ultimately it doesn't matter how awesome he is in every other way-- eventually, and by eventually I mean pretty quickly, any attraction will wane because I do love my orgasms and I honestly get kind of resentful when I'm in a relationship with a dude who can't give them to me-- more so if I'm expected to give him his.

I know its kind of a first world problem but it has absolutely killed two promising relationships I've had in the past two years to be dating a guy where, and he gets hot, and eventually I get him off-- maybe even multiple times-- and I get nothing. It is both physically and emotionally frustrating.

And, openly discussing his lack of size to a guy I was seeing, and although yes, he was incredibly, impressively, cool about it-- ultimately I found there was nothing that could be said or done to make it better-- I mean, it's not like he can just make it bigger.

I am very open to the idea of swinging but I would really like to have one main

To complicate this all even further-- it makes me feel SO GUILTY. SO. SO. SO. SO. G U I L T Y. I'm a girl who had serious body image problems earlier in life and even today, as Dan Savage would say, ""the price of admission"" to dating me. ...so I feel like a real cunt for dumping guys just because they have small dicks. More so because I have never found myself able to actually tell one of these guys The Truth about why I'm dumping them. Because honestly? If a guy chooses not to date me for something about me that I can't change-- honestly I am okay with it. Like if a guy honestly felt that my ass was too big (I have a naturally large booty-- it is possible to make it go away, but I don't mind it and the amount of work it takes to get rid of it-- I know because I've done it before-- is not worth it to me) --I could laugh it off. I could get over it.

But of course, many times I have had to conceal a look of deep disappointment and then follow it up with a blow job or some *really* awkward and unsatisfying sex and then try to tap dance my way out of there ala Amy Schumer.  ...which is not to suggest that I wish guys would wear color coded plastic bracelets (like the karate belt version of livestrong bracelets) to help me sort it out. I'm just sayin' please for the love of spaghetti-- does anyone have a decent strategy for this? (I know, no  one does. Sux.)

**TL;DR I can't date guys with small dicks. I'm pretty sure its not my fault but it makes me feel terrible anyway and leads to lots of awkward situations.**

I'm in my late 30s. My friends say I'm funny, all average around a year at most. Most of the people I've had sex with have been one night stands of flings (not that my number is high considering my age). My last relationship ended in 07, and I've tried on and off to date, I've tried dating sites and I have an active social life and I meet people all the time at public fictions and parties (not bars, I do go to bars but I'm not there to meet people).

I have a lot going on with work and I decided I just don't have the energy of attention to give to someone else. So, I decided just to be open to whatever came along.

Only I am finding myself not interested in most of it. When I am interested what happens typically is there's fooling around, if I get laid at all. Sometimes the guy gets off and that's it...

I'm not much to look at. I wear glasses, I could do better than him. I'd instigate a lot of fights and a couple of times he'd get physical and hit me in the face. One time he blacked my eye so it was swollen shut and my jaw clicked. I know a lot of you will get up in arms about this but I hoped that would happen. I goaded him into it. I feel an incredible rush when being demeaned, criticized, hit and treated badly. If I didn't there is no way I'd have been with him. I know even I can do better and when people see me with him I feel that pang of shame that I enjoy. When he calls me names, hits me or forces me it's like a buzz that gets into my head. I get instantly aroused. He's raped me (truly against my will, I tried to fight him off) and in a way I found it thrilling.

I left him though, gangraped, I could never admit this to anyone. My friends would have me committed. After the breakup I put up an ad as an escort and I have a number of clients I see regularly. None are men I would see if they weren't paying me and I don't enjoy it sexually but physiologically...I get flushed with arousal.

First

At first I tried my typical ""superwoman"" tactic of ignoring the problem, but didn't push anything. I had trouble reaching my PCP, so he called and made the appointment for me. At work one of the clients asked me if everything was okay. If this man could figure out I wasn't okay, I realized I probably wasn't coping as well as I had thought. 

After work I went to the ER at the hospital where my PCP is based. I still couldn't say the words out loud, and in less than 24 hours I was getting the medical care I needed. I was there for seven hours, in a private room. The staff was sensitive, they didn't push for details, they laid out my options clearly. I had taken Plan B that morning, so they gave me a cocktail of antibiotics, and took lots of blood to test. The hospital social worker came in, and am going back today. I have a follow up appointment with the infectious disease department on Friday.

In regard to the man, and texted him. I said ""I've been thinking a lot about last night and what happened was not okay. You didn't listen when I said no, when I set limits, or when I asked you to stop. I feel like you didn't respect me. I don't think we should see eachother again. If that changes I will let you know."" His response was that I was just hung up on my boyfriend (aside to new readers, I'm in an open relationship), and I couldn't handle being a little out of control, but he would delete my number and asked me not to contact him. Really I think this was the best case scenario. 

The crying has slowed, and I haven't been undressed except fast showers. It's going to take some time, but I'm going to be okay. Thank you all again.

But he just really went for it, and I felt like I owed it to *myself* to return whatever he gave to me. Maybe if someone just invested in me, I could reciprocate and maybe that would be what relationships are and I could be a normal human being. 

One thing led to another. I didn't know what the hell I was doing, I ended up giving him a handjob until he came. And then the night was fucking over. I hadn't cum, and despite his oral efforts I really wasn't even that wet. I probably should have left just then, but I couldn't justify just going over there for sexy times if I hadn't even… had… sexy times. So I might as well stay for the companionship?

Our relationship is good and in a stable place.  We always try to communicate clearly about our problems, penetration, skin on skin contact) but I've never gotten extremely aroused and I think the main cause of this is that I'm not particularly attracted to my boyfriend's body.  For the record I identify as bisexual as I do feel sexual attraction for both men and women so the issue of not being aroused by men is not an issue.

Recently I've been feeling dejected about sex.  My boyfriend is always telling me how much he loves the sex we have and how attracted he is to me.  Although I enjoy the sex he knows I don't get as much pleasure out of it as he does and he wants me to be happy.  He's very receptive to suggestions and is always asking me what he can do to make the sex better.  The problem is that I don't feel physically attracted to his body which makes it very hard for me to get aroused in the first place.  My boyfriend is slightly overweight and I find myself being attracted to men who are more slender.  I know that if I ever told him this it crush him as he is very sensitive about his body image and I don't want it to cause a rift between us.  Several years ago before I met him he used to be much heavier and when he was growing up he used to be bullied about it so I know he feels very self conscious about his body.  I don't feel grossed out by his body

My sex drive varies from moderately active to slightly less active than average.  I am also fairly sexually inexperienced.  While I would like to have more sexual relationships (particularly with a male friend I've been casually seeing) I am afraid to do so because of my past sexual encounters.

With my last (and only) sexual partner, I felt absolutely no sexual attraction to either his cock or his reactions to my pleasuring him.  I felt...numb.  Even when he tried to touch my breasts or clit, I felt like I had frozen up.  Absolutely no pleasure.  It literally felt like I had no sexual attraction to him at all (despite how sexually appealing making out, ect, had previously felt.) I tried to make the most of it, but he could tell something was wrong (because the whole experience was highly unenjoyable for me).  That problem of being unattracted to him during sex continued throughout our relationship, which was short lived after that.

I thought that I might be asexual or homosexual for a while because of this (as I identify as bisexual/pansexual) but I still find men sexually attractive.  I also thought that my loss of attraction might have come from anxiety because of my sexual inexperience

Does anyone have any advice on what this might be or how I can fix this?  I don't think this is normal!  If it helps

Inserting anything into any part of myself has always felt wrong. I was never the kid who put stuff up my nose


Enter boyfriend. He was very mindful about my comfort and never forced anything on me, trying again until successful sexy times were had.
After that sex was always a little painful to begin with but would become enjoyable enough to orgasm a few times.
Until I got thrush. At least that's what I think it was. There wasn't any 'cottage cheese' like I had heard about in health class. In fact, I thought that maybe it was my eczema and thought that it would sort itself out.


So off to the doctor I went. I remember telling her that I suspected I might have thrush and she took a swap and I was told I would get a call if anything was found. A few weeks later I hadn't heard anything and went back to the clinic and saw another doctor. She took one look and started writing out a thrush treatment. When I enquired about my test results
Thrush cleared up in a matter of days on this treatment, using tampons would bring tears to my eyes. I saw a few different GPs at my clinic about possible treatments but they all seemed at a loss. It was suggested I see a gynaecologist and I chose a private on who was close to home.


By this point, which made it hurt.
On inspection


At my last visit, if I tried to move it in and out, it felt extremely unpleasant. My doctor looked at me and said ""Well if it feels fine and then suddenly hurts, don't you think it's in your head?"" No, I didn't say it suddenly starts hurting, I said it would start to hurt after some time. But I received the same ""I think it's in your head"" nonsense back at me and that was it. No attempt to refer me to any doctors or therapists who could help me from this point. I was so taken aback that I didn't realise I was angry until I got home.


A few months later I was at my GP clinic for a routine prescription and happened to mention my problem. I had done some research and asked if I could try an oestrogen cream. This angel of a GP listened to my history and told me that she also worked at the sexual health clinic and if I was willing


At the sexual health clinic (I'm told my doctor is more thorough than most), one stung a little and one almost made me leap out of my chair. The pain was wear I had been experiencing the stinging sensation for years now and now I had proof it wasn't in my head! I given some oestrogen cream to thicken the area and told to go back in a few weeks. On my third visit, my third dot test resulted in no pain whatsoever. Nothing. It was a surprise to both me and my doctor how fast the treatment was working.


I'm only starting to work up the nerve to start having sex again. Sex has ended in pain and humiliation for longer than I ever enjoyed it and it's hard to get over that hurdle. I have been to a physio who specialises in vaginal issues and I've already learnt so much about my pelvic floors. I always had a super human ability to hold my wee and apparently that hasn't bee helping my situation. Soon
The reason for this post is that for so long I tried treatments that didn't work and had doctors shrug their shoulders because any vaginal issues look like all the other vaginal issues. I felt so alone and scared. I was scared I would lose my boyfriend and scared I would never have a healthy sex life.

I hope this helps.

Just to give you some background, we have amazing sex. I expected all of the usual awkwardnesses of having sex with someone the first time and was pleasantly surprised when our first coitus felt more like sleeping with a long-time partner.

He is giving, and creative in bed. He always puts my needs first and always asks what I want or need, even though I can never think of anything else he could possibly do for me.

The only problem is that he never cums. I don't know why or if it's more because he *can't* or more because he *doesn't want to*. At first he would just say he didn't want to because then we would have to stop

I've tried many things. I've told him I want him to finish if he wants to, some of which was taboo for me before, but now I would do it for him if it would help. When I give him HJs and BJs, he *usually* says he feels a moment away from cumming throughout the whole thing, but last week, he said he was cumming in my throat and  stopped himself. ^*sigh*

I just don't understand. I've been with enough guys before to know this is certainly unusual, because if he's still enjoying it and I'm satisfied, then I guess there's not really a problem. I just feel like maybe I've always linked cumming with satisfaction and there's a part of me that might always be self-conscious that I'm not doing enough for him unless he finishes.

1368858399.0,1ekdod,UPDATE: Can't stand the taste when my guy ejaculates in my mouth and I feel like a jerk :/,keiraB,39,14,15,"Hey everyone.  First of all

I wanted to keep everyone who was kind enough to offer their advice updated on the situation.  Sorry it's so long.

I suggested the masque strips to my S.O. thinking it would maybe help break the ice on the touchy subject or at the very least hint that part of the reason I haven't been going down on him as much is because of the taste.  Well

So I decided I would have to talk to him about it.  I kind of just decided to go for it when the topic began to come up.  I realized there would simply be no ""ideal"" time to say what was on my mind so this evening when we were talking about sex already, which sort of came out of nowhere for me.  

Apparently his no. 1 grievance with me is that I don't seem into it when I go down on him.  It was a truly WTF moment for me because even though I haven't done it to completion for him in two months

I told him the only time I might not be into it is when I'm afraid he'll be expecting me to do it until he gets off, but my chest/stomach is perfectly fine.  So for example, if I'm on my period and I go down on him, I know that he's expecting me to finish him and as SOON as he asks to go in my mouth, yes, I am less into it.  It made me feel uncomfortable to say no to that because I was afraid of hurting his feelings if I said WHY I wasn't interested.

He also told me when we do it as foreplay that I seem way less into it than when I randomly do it for him out of the blue.  He told me when we do it before sex, he's right about me not being that into it during foreplay *sometimes* and b., apparently even when I AM into it, he can't tell.

So I guess this issue opened up a whole new can of worms but I suppose it's better that we're talking about it and our individual issues are now out in the open.

If we're just laying in bed and he tries to reach around to touch my breasts/nipples I push him away because it feels bad to me. It's like they're hyper sensitive and I don't like it when he touches them. I don't masturbate, even though we've been together for over 2 years. 

Recently it's become a problem because he doesn't understand and I don't know how to express it. I want to like sex! But even the thought of trying to ""spice it up"" is just so uninteresting to me. The only time that I do enjoy sex is when I initiate it which is pretty rare.

Is there anything that a girl who was taught abstinence and is now having sex should know? (I'm on Depo-Provera and only have one partner right now. And I know that when I get new partners we should get tested before having sex.)

This isn’t really about sex exactly

Now the problem I’m referring to in the title is probably the opposite of what you think it might be. I feel like I’m *too* monogamous. By this I mean that my boyfriend really is the only guy sexually attractive to me. I can see how other guys can be hot or good looking or cute or whatever

Now the problem is this: I feel like I’m doomed to a life of disappointment and misery because of this. I want my partner to feel this way about me, it’s normal, but it makes me so sad.  

How the hell can I deal with this and get over it?? I don’t like how I usually try to make my boyfriend feel shame for watching porn (I get very defensive and bitter about it, bitter tyrannical shrew and I want my boyfriend to feel it’s ok to be a perfectly normal person. I hate that he has to keep this part of him from me to prevent me getting upset. I want to get rid of the feelings of pain and hurt I experience whenever it’s brought up because it’s not normal and it’s not healthy.

Part of my problem, it’s a passing thing. I don’t think about them later, I don’t masturbate thinking of them, I don’t compare my boyfriend to them. However, I’ve somehow got it in my head that guys do all of those things. How can I possibly live up to someone he’s seen in porn or on the street knowing he’s seen me being gross and slobby? It’s like they’re the perfect ideal as he is only seeing them in that moment, whereas I’m the flawed reality. I feel like such a disappointment to him sometimes, even though he assures me he finds me incredibly attractive and whatnot. It’s also pretty obvious that I sometimes have issues with my self-esteem which are just adding to this mess. I say sometimes because sometimes I’ll be kind of ok with this whole thing and think “well whatever he thinks about them isn’t going to stop him from loving me”

I am in my early 20s and I have suffered from heavy vaginal discharge from around when I was 12 years old (way prior to when I was sexually active) which was about the time I started puberty. I have always been very self conscious of this and thought I was odd. Only recently have I found out that discharge can sometimes be normal

I am to have my first gynecologist appointment coming up in a week or so, but are not what I consider abnormal. I am about a week away from getting my period, and I usually suffer from heavy discharge right beforehand. The two weeks after my period I usually don't have any, though I would say I can be very wet and often times soak through my undies. I mostly wear cotton underwear, but occasionally I will wear a thong or spandexy ones. 

As you can see in these photos, clear discharge and sometimes it feels just like water. I know when I was younger I used to fear I was peeing myself, not because I felt like I was peeing, but because it was SO wet. I also have noticed I have a small tear above my clitoris. This is common for me after sex, along with tears at the bottom of my vaginal opening. I did have sex two days ago now, and I knew at the time I felt a tear. My partner and I do use lube, but I'm not sure if it ever really makes a difference for me.

I'm normally a very open person about sex -- I majored in gender and sexuality studies

Ok, and when it is, I'm having trouble making myself comfortable enough to truly just enjoy it. I have had a good number of partners and experiences and am confident in my body, but there are still things and positions that I don’t feel as comfortable with as I would like to (mainly those involving me on top or a large distance between him and me—I am very conscious of my facial expressions when he can see ALL of me, even though I know I shouldn’t be. It’s something I need to work on).

I’m not used to his body type, leg and arm positions, etc, but it’s still just… not there. The pillows help a little, but not as much as we hoped. I’ve had similar issues with the only other partners I’ve had with similar body types, so I do think this is somehow related. 

Also: I don’t want to potentially blame it on something silly, but even the slight difference might be impacting us somehow. I’ve also had this experience in the past as well.

I personally have been dealing with some emotional issues (anxiety/depression) since we have been together, but mostly those relating to frequency and desire. For being involved with each other for almost 6 months, we have not had sexual contact nearly as much as we both feel we should have/want to. That does probably affect our comfort level with some sexual acts, but given how open and understanding we are and how willing we are to try, it just doesn’t explain everything. And the mechanical problems occur even when the desire is there.

He has his own slew of problems that also are impacting us-- he comes incredibly fast from penetrative sex, anything, at least the first couple of times in a session. I don’t necessarily have a problem with this, I’m just not used to it. He is used to coming multiple times whenever he has sex, and I’ve never had that experience with another partner. He doesn’t enjoy coming that quickly, and he says it’s not really something that has happened quite like this before (he chalks it up to a lack of masturbation, which he is trying to fix, and an incredibly strong desire/attraction to me). I have supported him with this as much as I can in trying to make it work, but even then I feel like I’m barely doing anything at all. The kind of sexual play that I feel like I need – harder, I feel like I am not even there sometimes.

When we first got involved, experiences, fantasies, etc – perhaps too quickly. Did we shoot ourselves in the foot? Sometimes I feel like our extreme openness in the beginning was too much, and because we haven’t been able to live up to what we feel we should be able to do, we get discouraged. Is that even possible?

I’ve gotten to a point where I feel that, but I don’t know how to get there anymore. 

Help me out here. Is the situation hopeless? What new things can we try to make sex pleasurable for us both? Positions, anything I am missing? I can elaborate on anything anyone feels is necessary to truly give your opinions.

I've thought about (without the intention to follow through) cheating on him just so I can get a good long fuck. It feels way better when he goes fast

He doesn't even apologize. I think I'd be okay with it if he made an effort and we did it again like an hour later when he got his stamina back or whatever. But that's just it. Two to four minutes

Like I said, because he's always been that way. He says he doesn't really know how to last longer. Every once in awhile, he'll be able to last a long while, but more times than not, it's over right when it starts feeling good.

I don't know what to do. I really want to do it longer, and sometimes makes him come even faster. I just want sex that lasts at least ten to fifteen minutes once he sticks it in.

We never ended up using the harness or the larger dildo because he felt that he was not ready for something that size. It was still something new for him to have someone else control the movement of the dildo because usually something like that or anything more than one finger was private for him. We talked about it later and he mentioned that if we had not had so much trouble keeping the shorter dildo in that he would have cum from it without even having to touch himself which made me feel good about everything. After I left to go home from the weekend he told me that he would work on preparing himself for the larger dildo and that it is something he wants to do alone and that once he can do it then

For some background, maybe once a week now. I also am a lot more aroused during both sex and masturbation when my bladder is full. One of the main ways I get myself wet before even touching my clit is by pressing down on my lower abdomen towards my pubic bone. I think the reason why that feels good is because it is pressing against the bladder which in turn  presses against my G-spot. I exclusively masturbate by touching my clit, I find it physically tiring to finger myself trying to target my G-spot, and it feels nowhere as good as clit stimulation. I expressed my interest in squirting to my boyfriend and he did try a couple of times to make me squirt by aiming for the G-spot. Problem number one: I'm never soaking wet when this occurs which means after about 30 secs of thrusting, it starts to kind of hurt. Problem number two: When it does feel good I feel like I am going to pee on him, which would probably turn our sexual chemistry off for the rest of eternity lol. But biggest issue is because I know he's looking for some kind of spectacular ending and if I don't squirt I won't give it to him, I keep thinking about it the whole time and feel terrible for making him do so much work :(. So yeah, biggest squirter blocker EVER. 

Anyways, and my playing with myself lasted longer, and it was not due the usual frustration at not getting aroused enough to orgasm (since I started taking the meds) but more of playfulness and everything I was watching was turning me on incredibly.  No idea why, as I had been doing my usual routine. Did not think much of it, it happened before. But when I came JUST from touching my clit (again, my bladder was full) I felt a trickle down my down-there lips. No, there was no mind-numbing full-body orgasm like the ones often associated with squirting, really do not need to go about changing my sheets this late at night."" When I turned on the lights

Anyways, was insisting on it quite vehemently actually. I later deduced that maybe he was feeling bad for not being able to make me come or that he was not a part of it. I dunno... he was just being quite weird and not interested for someone who had seemed quite ecstatic about wanting to make me squirt before. It kind of hurt, because this was a huge deal to me. 

After Facetiming, and within minutes, I felt a slightly bigger trickle down my lips, and sure enough it dripped onto my sheets. As gross as this may sound, after smelling and visually inspecting the  spot, I tasted it. It was not pee. It didn't smell or taste like anything really, just clear fluid. 

What are your thoughts ladies? Do you think it is squirt liquid or something else I'm misinterpreting (given the lack of g-spot stimulation and whole-body orgasms)?

&gt;The symptoms of low testosterone can also fool a guy because they are so ubiquitous.  By that I mean that testosterone affects EVERYTHING in the male. It affects our brain, our blood - the list goes on and on. Of course, the number one thing in most guys' mind is how it affects their sex life.  Low testosterone affects both libido and erectile strength to varying degrees and that obviously isn't too good for the ol' sex life.

However, difficulty concentrating, anxiety, loss of muscle, increased weight gain, decreased facial hair and a general feeling of not caring about anything.  **When you are low on testosterone, you often just don't care about anything - you just ""exist"".**  Pleasure and desire can be greatly decreased greatly affecting your career and your relationships.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXSex/comments/141y59/boyfriends_low_sex_drive_feeling_neglected/

Here it is: I think I'm able to orgasm. Whether during penetrative sex or by myself, my breathing and heart rate speed up, the pressure starts to build, my arms and legs go rigid, and then finally there's a release and I feel contractions down there. Occasionally, I squirt.

The problem is, I *feel* the physical contractions and all the rest of it, but I don't feel any pleasure. No release, no warmth spreading upwards, no tingling, none of what so many women have described to me.

It just sort of goes flat. Because I feel a certain amount of pleasure during the build-up, I'm clearly missing out, and that really sucks.

So I googled it

Now they mention that one of the common reasons for this is depression. 

Here's a bit of my sexual and mental history

* I only became sexually active (eg: had sex) when I was 18, hated my uni course and had no clue where my life was going: ended up eating a lot/not at all and crying/sleeping all the time). 

* I changed course and moved away

* I got a boyfriend about a month later (who was lovely and caring)

* After about 5 months later
 
* I became very depressed approx. 4 months later: went to counselling for a few months

* I stopped taking the pill in february

* My libido has come back full force

So maybe it has to do with my depression? As long as I can remember

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you cope? Is there some way to get over it? This is so frustrating and upsetting

I like this guy so much, at least I don't think so. I can insert four fingers in myself comfortably when I'm wet. I can also use large tampons comfortably.

He is seven inches

Whenever he inserts the head of his penis it kind of hurts... but I can deal. As soon as he starts pushing more though

He says that when he's inside me and trying to penetrate me

Is it the angle? Am I not wide enough? I can fit the head... Am I not wet enough? I seem to have adequate amounts of lubrication because when I'm with him, others say it didn't. R/sex seems to have the general consensus that it shouldn't hurt the first time.

Is my pain tolerance low? Should he just shove it in? Some girls have advised me to just grit my teeth and that it'll feel good once the pain is over. I've also read that advice on forums and things. It's not like I'm nervous- I really do want to have sex. However

I just want to be able to enjoy sex. Can some ladies give me opinions? I'm also thinking of crossposting this to /r/sex just for additional measure. I really need help. 

tl;dr: I can fit the head of his penis. Anything after is pretty painful. I would describe the sensation as the penis trying to penetrate something that won't breach

When we do have sex, forget about it. I just went on the pill, and now that he can actually finish inside me, I NEVER finish first. I can't even remember the last time he actually gave me an orgasm. I try not to be selfish and have always considered myself a giving lover. I'm on anti-depressants and am not always the easiest nut to crack, but neither is he. I'm sick of giving him 45 minute blowjobs and getting nothing back.

I am in a LDR with my boyfriend. We see each other every 2 to 4 months. Of course when we meet we are very horny and have sex as soon as we arrive either at his or at my place. I get very wet and all, and it took me a while to understand the pain was outside. Last time we met it didn't hurt much, but the time before that it hurt really bad for at least one week.

This is the biggest problem: the pain won't go away for a couple of days to a week, but it hurts when he's trying to get inside me. I try relaxing as much as possible but sometimes I can't do that because I know it's gonna hurt (even for just a few seconds) and it's a vicious circle.

I'm not too worried, which wouldn't normally hurt, but because of that ""spot"" it hurts so bad that I just start wishing he would finish and eventually when I can't take it anymore I ask him to stop. 

I just want to say he knows all of this, if we only see each other for a couple of days it can be annoying), but I'm just wondering if this is normal and if any of you can relate to this. I may also need to add that when we aren't with each other I don't use a vibrator or anything that goes inside me.

**TLDR:** Sex drive has rapidly decreased


I'm 20/F, and neither of us are willing to risk sex unless we have the house completely empty. 

Throughout the summer, ladies. I'm not sure what I can do, and I want the last month of summer to be amazing for us since I'm studying abroad soon and won't see him for almost a year. I've thought of a few possible things that could be lowering my sex drive:


* **Tired.** I've been working nearly every day this summer

* **Not attracted to him.** I don't know how to talk to my boyfriend about this without coming off as really superficial, but when I spend time with attractive, muscular guys at the gym, it's really hard for me to come home and feel sexually attracted to him. I have no idea how to bring this up without really hurting his self esteem. 


* **Feeling too pressured.** We have a very limited amount of time to have sex and it makes me feel like there's a ton of pressure on me. I have to get horny as soon as possible before the parents get home or else we'll have to stop in the middle of everything. But the thing is


* **Bored.** When we do have sex, make out, undress, touch, sex (shower, rinse, repeat). I really enjoy spontaneity. I've tried to communicate this to my boyfriend but he doesn't understand. He asks, what do you want to try then?"". I don't know! I just want something *different*. I'm not saying I want to try anal or BDSM

Although my boyfriend has been understanding of this (hasn't tried to pressure me into sex when I'm not in the mood), and it hasn't affected my sex drive in the past.

This is really hard to write, I am a 19 year old female) This always hits home when I read people's accounts of how wonderful sex is, or how relaxed and happy they sound. I always start crying because I wish I had what they did. 

I am currently with my boyfriend of over 2 1/2 years, we still have no idea what we're doing. He is the love of my life, and I could not be in a happier relationship. In essence, we are both very very happy.

But... I don't feel like I enjoy sex as much as I should/could, I find him incredibly attractive, and I love him to bits. Thinking it over, I think there are several issues.

First, but I can't help feeling incredibly guilty about it. I honestly can't quite put my finger on why. The whole ""if you have sex, you're incredibly bad and are going to ruin your life"" talk runs through my head every time things begin. It makes it difficult to feel sexy or attractive, and even when I do, I feel bad for thinking that way. He kisses my neck, not even in a sexual environment, I'll love it, want him

Second, like for example, if he goes on my chest. I'll avoid touching the area for over a day, like I'm afraid they're going to cling to my hands and jump off when I use the restroom. XD I'm aware of how silly this is. I know sperm don't jump. I'm on birth control, we use condoms as well (even though he wants to go inside me with nothing in the way... which is... hard to even think about) I just don't know how to go about calming down those inner voices of fear.

Finally, and tries so hard, but it usually ends up hurting or feeling too strong. I know it's cliche, but I just feel a bit broken. The thing is, even if I tried being more communicative, I don't know what on earth I'd tell him. I have NO idea what would feel good or what he should do. I realize that it's just part of the process of figuring each other out, but I feel like SOMETHING should have felt good by now... right? Obviously, but really

I'm having a bit of a struggle, and I'm working on them. 

Background: I've been with my SO for eight years, my face lit up every time he called, he has supported me through major health issues. In the spring of 2012 he took a job across the country (and three time zones). Things have been really rocky since. I screwed up all my courage and told him how unhappy I have been. We are still best friends but the passion is gone. I think we could rekindle it, but its going to take a lot of work. He agreed. I set two provisions under which I would be willing to do the heavy lifting of putting us back together: he needed to give me a definitive answer regarding children/marriage (why should I work so hard if we aren't on the same page?), and that when he moves back to our area his primary residence will be with me. (He lives with his parents, its cultural. He had asked me to move in part time when he visits the area back in December but it was all talk.) I gave him 15 days to make the decision (he wouldn't without a deadline). He ""thought the date was (15 days later)"", but gave me an answer (yes) to the first question, he feels like we haven't dated enough other people to be sure this is the happiest we can be. So


I've been on two dates with two men, but ended up having piv sex in both cases. In the first case I said no, we shouldn't because he has a girlfriend (entirely different issue, yes), but things continued to move forward. It wasn't so much I didn't want to, but felt we shouldn't. I felt okay about it afterwards, he is a nice guy and we still talk but aren't dating. I went on my second date last night with a guy I met on a dating website. I made abundantly clear that we would not be having sex, trying to prevent a repeat of before. So we went for a walk in my neighborhood (mistake one), but would really appreciate some advice on making my ""no"" clearer. I'm going to take my self off the dating website until I can get this issue a bit more under control. 

I really appreciate any help you can give me. I'm feeling really sad and powerless about this whole situation

I was always cautious, but I figured I would be ok since I've gone this long on both the pill and antibiotic use, and am only now encountering the problem.

The vaguely familiar itching of my vulva area started to arise, but now I'm starting to feel the effects again. Slightly itchy/tickly down there, and the discharge is white and starting to look like cottage cheese again. 

I'm going to the doctor in two days for a physical anyway

I feel like I'm so distracted and I really can't truely relax.  I try to just close my eyes and let it happen but as soon as we begin P in V sex my brain shuts down.  I feel like my brain just shuts down and I feel my face starting to frown and the tears coming.  

I just don't know why I do it.  He always stops when I ask him too and he might make a comment about having blue balls but he is very understanding.  I just can't understand why sex makes me so unhappy.  I don't ever feel like I can truely relax and I don't know what to do.  

There are instances where I will try to fight the feeling such as the last time we did it.  It was dark outside and he was doing it from behind.

He occasionally had *a little bit* of difficulty getting or maintaining an erection during the beginning of our relationship but the issue has become more pronounced as time goes on. Now almost every time we attempt PiV sex he goes soft at some point.

About a month ago he was on a 3-month stay in the next town for work and was only able to come back once a week or once every other week, because he seemed disheartened. That area of our sex life has improved, but I'm worried I damaged his sexual confidence.

He tries to push towards manual and oral stimulation a lot to take the pressure off himself

He eats fairly healthy, so I'm not medically overweight but I am very conscious of the fact that I'm carrying more fat than most women I see my age.

Despite all that, I've never achieved orgasm, nor do I get any feeling of build-up during sex or masturbation. Sometimes too much stimulation of my clit can affect me emotionally to a point where it's unbearable (but I'm not really upset--unsure how to describe this), either alone or with someone, and once I got a really weird feeling, that seemed like it could be orgasm

Also, so I imagine my search terms aren't quite what they should be. I suppose I'm looking for a more personal/in-depth exploration of the topic and mental aspects of it, rather than 'talk to your girlfriend about your hopes for the future so she knows you trust her and sex is better'.

I'm 22 years old and I have never put anything in my vagina. No tampons, and definitely no penises have been in there either. I masturbate pretty regularly but never touch it directly. I usually touch myself through my panties or with a massaging showerhead. Any thought of touching it directly or putting anything inside really freaks me out. Even looking at it in a mirror makes me feel uncomfortable.

I attended a Christian school for junior high and high school where sexuality was not openly discussed and so I kind of avoided thinking about it throughout my teen years. I didn't have my first orgasm until I was 19, I never let him put his fingers inside me. I did enjoy oral sex though, and he was very generous with it. The one time I thought I was ready to have sex, I freaked out when he started applying pressure and at that point I was done. That, among other issues, was the reason we broke up. I've been single for over a year now and I'm afraid I will ruin another relationship if I don't deal with this on my own first.

This is something I'm trying to get over, which is just silly. It's just a piece of plastic with some cotton inside! Why am I so afraid of it?

I want to be comfortable with every part of my body. I don't know why I'm so afraid of the most intimate part of myself. Eventually I'm going to have to go to the gynecologist and get a pelvic exam and that will NOT go well if I'm all tense and nervous. For now the best I can do is to keep trying. I guess I'm looking for some encouragement. Or maybe a similar story and how you ladies dealt with it.

1370961398.0,1g4fcf,I probably/definitely/maybe/could have genital warts and I'm confused,knowADayK,21,5,10,"I'm sorry

Back in jan/feb I noticed a tiny lump on my vulva, but I stupidly believed him.

At this point I'd been with my boyfriend for just over a year

So about a month ago the lump is still there having not changed in size, anything. I went back to the doctor again (it's a family practise so I get a different GP each time, which can really effect your diagnosis I think) and after an examination he told me there was a chance it was a wart. He said it was most likely to just be a skin tag of some sort, but I still ended up tearing up in his office because of the suggestion. He tells me to get checked at the GUM clinic and come back. I couldn't really see how we could have gotten it as he'd told me that before me he had only ever had protected sex in all forms, and my only previous partner had been a virgin too.

That night on the phone to my boyfriend (moderate long distance) I asked him if he'd been checked recently, he says he was told by the clinic that it's possible to develop HPV as a couple and that we both definitely had it by now, but it wasn't harmful. I wouldn't think in a million years he had been unfaithful, but I was distraught that he'd kept something like this from me for so long when I'd been working so hard to improve how we communicated and we were finally really happy in the relationship.

The next day I had my first A level exam of the year just to add more fun, gonorrhea and chlamydia as usual and did an examination to check the lump. This time I was really certain to not let the doctor leave until I was sure she'd seen the stupid thing, and told her about what my boyfriend had said. After much patronising explaining the different parts of the vulva to me (I'm not a hyperchondriac dammit! I was sent here by my doctor!) she assured me it looked nothing like a wart and suggested my boyfriend's doctors didn't know what they were talking about. 

So now I'm massively confused, he cried for the first time in years. I said he needed to be in my city in two weeks for the follow up GP appointment to explain exactly what had been said to him and he agreed. Our relationship pretty much went back to normal, chatting every night though I was seriously miserable at what had happened and wasn't dealing great with all my school exams.

So last wednesday I pick him up from the station. We act couply as usual

On the way home we cried and argued, we'd been together for so long it was pretty irrelevant anyway, I was just terrified by the fact he'd spent so much time just lying to me so much. The next day before he left we had another serious conversation that involved me telling him I couldn't move past all this. It was the saddest break up ever, we spent two hours sobbing and talking, neither of us wanted it to happen, he hates himself for causing it and I just want to go back to when I didn't know about all the lying and could just love him.

The next day I had my final exam which I know I absolutely blew I was in such a fucking state. I then managed to forget to pick up my referral letter so couldn't get it until monday, though I missed my catch up. I have no idea if I'm going to have this all my life and risk passing in onto all future partners.

I don't really blame him, and I feel awful for ending it when we were finally in a place where he could communicate with someone properly for the first time. I just want him back right now to be honest, I know I just need to get over him after something like this but I don't want to get over him.

I've never done anything like that before and it scared me. He leaves after seeing that I'm uncomfortable, doesn't say anything. After he leaves i run to the bathroom and cry.

So

I'm a month shy of 19 and my boyfriend of two years recently turned 19 himself. We are happily committed, and know that we are going to spend our lives together(young, I know, I know).

We have abstained from piv and anal sex so far. I have always wanted to wait until marriage, mostly not...), but because half of my family have ruined their life plans through unplanned pregnancies; my mom and her family moved to another state when she became pregnant at sixteen and didn't know who the father was, my dad isn't part of my older sisters life because he didn't want to spend his life with her mother and she refused to allow him to even consider being apart of my sisters life, my cousin had a child with a scumbag, she dropped out of school, went through major depression, and with the luck my family seems to have, condoms and birth control are extremely effective if used correctly

I have also told family that I'm waiting for marriage, which makes my blood absolutely boil.

Boyfriend has been completely understanding, or how awesome sex is, or how waiting is ""pointless"" and you need to be sure of your sexual compatibility or the first time is never good, or just thinking about having sex with my boyfriend, I get so excited and anxious and I question why we are waiting, and if it's even worth it. I've had this conversation with the boyfriend and he is up for anything I'm comfortable with, as long as that's truly what I want.

We still wouldn't have sex right now, which is a much shorter time period than when we are wanting to get married(5-8 years).

I just can't stop thinking about this conflict going on in my head. I want to have sex with him, and I know that's such a silly, stupid thing to even consider because it's no reason to withhold sex from someone, including myself, but, ugh!

I really don't know what to think/feel/do. I know most of reddit believes waiting until marriage is stupid, if only to ease my mind. Do you have any suggestions/stories/comments/questions, twoxsex? Anything is welcome.

I'm wondering about the experiences of people here: do you feel depressed after sex

The science suggests that the cascade of brain chemicals can affect you up to 2 weeks after orgasmic sex. And that like a drug, skin contact, cuddling, can mute this ""crash"" effect. And that this effect is particularly strong (to the point where it causes problems) in something like 5% of women.

I have seen in myself that the natural surge of interest in sex right around the time I ovulate can sometimes make me really interested, and then I don't want *anything* until around day 4 or my period (which, perhaps not coincidentally, is about 2 weeks). But the effect is muted when I have less sex during my fertile time. Interesting. I wonder how much of this is brain chemistry. I am prone to depression at other times, as well as pms mood swings. I wonder if this is related.

I had sex with my FWB yesterday after not seeing him for more than a month. It was kind of awkward because we did it in the shower (I never realized how much of a logistical nightmare that is.) I was nervous after not seeing him for so long that while I feel like I was physically into it, but it takes a higher degree of intimacy and some encouragement for me to be vocal. I feel like he thinks he did all the work yesterday and the sex was bad.

Even the communication after the sex was bad. When I said that earlier in the day I had gotten my second shot of Gardasil for HPV

I like this guy. He's not my soulmate, but I'd like to express a desire for more aftercare after we have sex. I'm concerned that this was just a summer thing and he's getting ready to phase me out. I also can't seem to get over this ridiculous negative feedback loop in which I'm nervous around him, so I'm shy and somewhat inhibited in bed, which makes me afraid that he thinks I'm bad in bed, which makes me more nervous around him. He's on facebook chat right now - do I message him and apologize for yesterday being awkward or just never mention yesterday again? Do I wait until Sunday when he's maybe less busy and message him to get together? Do I leave it alone and let him come to me when he wants to? I feel like I'm more stressed out than I should be over a FWB relationship but I'm an anxious person by nature.

A few nights ago I was with my FWB(he and I are both 19. I am a virgin, finger fuck' kinda nights. I got up to change the music and he grabs my underwear, yanks them down to my knees, bites my ass and throws me back on the bed.

Now at this point in my time being physical with my friend

So he climbs over me, and warmly against my pussy.

He apologized immediately and reached down to tuck himself away but in that second of dick to vagina contact I was suddenly filled with the *NEED* FOR COCK. It was completely inexplainable. I'd felt him through his underwear
I had no intention of having sex with him from the start of our FWB relationship

So he asks me whats up

Aaaand that's where I fucked up and didn't get laid.

:c

After he asked if I was certain

I started birthcontrol June 13th. Exactly 2 weeks ago. My period started June 2nd and ended the 6th. I've had sex almost every day with my fiancee since it ended to now

Then that night on top of Plan B I took my very first BC pill.
My fiancee has never ever came inside me. We use the ""pull and pray"" as my doctor put it. My brother was telling me that I should still use condoms for a good 3 months because thats when the BC fully kicks in and your body gets used to it. I have no idea. My doctor said that I should use condoms for at least another week. and my brother(who isn't a doctor) said that didn't sound right and I should still wait 3 months.

So I'm paranoid. My period should start this Saturday if it's going to be 28 days apart. I was just wondering if the chance of pregnancy is high or if I'm just worrying for nothing.

I know not every time I have sex results in pregnancy but... I can't help how terrified I am of getting pregnant.

Background: 
Let me start this by saying I've always had mid-cycle bleeding. I was in a relationship for 7 years with the same man and I do not have STD's (was tested a month ago). My ex gave blood all the time. (I didn't because I have a bleeding disorder). I recently slept with a man I've been seeing. Condoms were used for thole thing. I went down on him and he went down on me as well. I woke up the day after with a RAGING UTI (I didn't pee after sex), and also doxycycline to take while chlamydia is ruled out because she saw WBC's under the microscope which apparently happens with chlamydia. 
(I REALLY don't think I have chlamydia. I tested negative a month ago

My question lies here: I've been taking the antibiotics for 3-4 days now and the bleeding has gotten WORSE. It's like a constant light trickle requiring a mini-pad. The odor is gone. The blood is fresh; bright red. I have mild cramping at times. I feel the infection is resolving BUT the bleeding is worsening. WTF is going on? I have a right ovarian cyst (3.3cm in size) but it's never wreaked havoc like this before. I also had cervical dysplasia and had a resultant colposcopy and normal Pap's since then. I cannot have another Pap until the bleeding stops. And it hasn't stopped!

Sorry if this has been covered before but it didn't seem like it. Plus I have to admit to also just wanting some support in this issue.

So when I was much younger I was sexually assaulted (on a date) and since then I have not really been able to orgasm with a partner.

The few few times it has happened in the past 6-7 years has been with only one guy and that's because he followed every single step I asked him to take. It was a long and arduous process.

My current problem is that, it took me close to 6 months with the ex-bf).

So how do I get past what appears to be a mental problem (physically it has happened so this must be an emotional/mental thing

I just want more autonomy in my orgasm. Right now it's so dependent on what the guy is doing that it's very frustrating for me.

I should add that I *can* achieve orgasm very easily through masturbation and with toys. That is no problem at all. Vaginally

So...any thoughts? Suggestions? Tips?

I recently started seeing this really cool dude. He's 21, anyway he's just awesome. Last night we made it to my bedroom for the first time (after several sloppy makeouts in semipublic places -- oh to be young). very fun times.

both of us decided we wanted to hold off on sex for a little while (probably not long

SO last night, and eventually he pulls me up and says, ""okay, so i don't want you to get the wrong idea, because you're *very* talented, but a lot of times that just doesn't do it for me... like, most of the time, because I really am

So I ask

This was not some kind of passive-aggressive pressuring move, considering I was super horny and was not exactly thinking clearly)

So, what can I do for him? The current state of affairs is very one-sided, and I want him to be having as much fun as I'm having. Any advice?

Generally I wouldn't post something like this but this topic has been weighing on my mind a little. I was hoping I could just talk to someone about it.  
    
Here's the backstory:  
My boyfriend and I have been together for 5 years. We have known each since we were 6, on the other hand, have always been on the lower end of libido. I had some abuse in my child hood and never really recovered a want for constant physical intimacy. I could enjoy it once I was worked up enough but for years it has been something thats frustrated me. I've always wanted to be able to match my SO, you know? Mentally I could. Physically was a completely different battle. He's been so understanding and loving with me, our relationship is great. However there is a recent development in our sex life and it's so frustrating...I think my delay of sexual energy has caught up with me. I am horny ALL THE TIME. I mean, miserably so. I can't get enough and it's physically painful. The other bad news? My SO's sex drive has gone down..tremendously. It makes no sense to me. My hormones kick in and his suddenly kicks out. He's still attracted to me but he doesn't seem to want sex/intimacy as much. I feel bad now that i'm on the flip side and don't particularly know what to do about this. It feels like a kick to the ego now that I just want to jump his bones all the time and he's just meh. We had a moderately active sex life before. I'm so new to this constant want/need and i'm embarrassed about it. How do you ladies deal with a high sex drive when your SO doesn't seem to want any?

We then tried again to have sex but this time we used loads of lube but he still couldn't get it in and then he lost it again. He was really angry and embarrassed and wouldn't look at me/touch me afterwards. I told him it was okay if we went slow and I started to give him a bj and he went completely soft in my mouth. He left my house shaking with anger and really embarrassed. He didn't even look at me or say anything when he went. 

This whole situation is making me feel like crap because I love my boyfriend so much and I'm worried this is a sign that he isn't attracted to me anymore and we're doomed to split up.

I hadn't even been noticing the pain, I'd just gotten used to it. That's in part because on a bad day I spend 2-3 hours in absolute agony - can't walk and just lay there and cry.

Hence;

- If you do experience pain
- How long does it take to go away?
- How often do you tear (if at all)?
- Am I just 400%  abnormal? Has anyone else gone through this?

Also, with your partner, what percentage of the time do you come? I think I come maybe 10% of the time. I get that's probably not normal considering it only takes 10 mins max to get me off.

I've been with my boyfriend for almost 2 years, we often go 4-7 month stretches without seeing each other, which means that every time we see each other again, sex hurts the first few times. Which is to be expected.

But, the part closer to my anus - the lower half of the opening ""ring,"" if you will - feels pretty sore. Like, as if it were cut or something. This limits our positions, as anything from behind exacerbates this soreness. He is always very patient and gentle with me, and on a few occasions it's been too sore to continue - and while he is always quick to stop, and tell me that he doesn't mind, and would like to be able to be more adventurous in bed

I am also (or I have been told by him) extremely tight, it is not usually painful when he is inside me, apart from the aforementioned vagina soreness.

We’re both pretty inexperienced (she was a virgin prior and I had a single one night stand while I was too drunk to remember much of anything) so some tips would be appreciated. I read here some girls can’t cum from penetration alone? If this is the case it would likely be the issue since we normally just start with some fingering until she’s properly prepared &amp; lubed for entry and then just thrust in various positions until we decide we’re ready to be done (at which point we get into a position that allows me to cum). The thrusting portion generally lasts somewhere between 45 minutes and 2 hours (2 is the longest we gone so far).

Some of the other possible issues we've thought of are the condoms, possibly because of the snugness). Third possible issue is since we’re both young privacy is an issue as we both live at home with parents and can only have sex late at night while being quite, thought maybe being nervous and worrying about not making too much noise could be a contributing factor. 

Thanks

HOWEVER, most amusing, predicament. I've struck up a friendship with a guy 10 years my junior who works near me (we're not co-workers, but we share space in a building and we work in similar fields. Closest thing you can call us are work-neighbors). After hanging out and casually chatting, he made a pass at me and, long story short, we've struck up a friends with benefits situation. 

This gent, smart, many of the things that flip my switches. We've messed around a few times (mutual masturbation, no sexual intercourse), and he's more dominant than most of the guys I've been with. He enjoys talking to me and seems very interested in exploring this, but isn't interested in a monogamous relationship which I'm fine with. This seems all win-win.

The problem I've been experiencing is some insecurities on my part. Part of me wonders why someone like him would be interested in someone like me. It's not just the age difference, I'd say I'm good looking but my body isn't... what I'd call attractive. I look at porn that features BBW's that feature bodies like mine and I can't get into them. I watch them trying to see what others might find attractive about my body type, and I just find it difficult. There are some hot ladies out there, don't get me wrong, and I read the responses and obviously there are people out there that are indeed huge fans, but I have trouble seeing myself as desirable. 

This can affect my involvement with this guy, plus it's been so long since I've been able to open up to anyone in this way. I know the problems are mine, I'm just trying to find a way to work through them. If I can, this could be a lot of fun for both of us.

He asks me whats wrong like 5 times and I just stare at him. Then he starts getting mad. ""If you're not going to fucking tell me what's wrong then I'm not going to care!""

He starts getting ready for work and I still just lay there. He finally comes over to me and asks me nicely whats wrong and I still don't have the guts to say it so I stay in silence. He says ""fine

So I've been seeing my current boyfriend for almost a year now and we've been having sex for about 7 months, 4'10"", naturally skinny and small boobs. Growing up people always assumed I was several years younger than I was, hell I'm 20 now and just the other day some waitress tried to give me the kid's menu. After awhile these assumptions (not to mention the teasing) can really start to wear you down emotionally and while I've started to feel better about my appearance since starting college, I've still never felt very womanly. 

Well about a year ago my boyfriend entered the picture and immediately I felt more comfortable with him than I had with other guys. He doesn't care about my height (he's no giant himself haha) and he's constantly telling me how pretty he sees me. I just feel comfortable and safe with him, like some kid having sex, despite the fact that I'm an adult and in no way feel like I'm too immature. I know my hang ups are taking away from our sex life because I can't fully concentrate on what we're doing and I don't feel comfortable to explore further into our sex life. 

The real kicker here is that I'm an incredibly sexual person. I've been exploring my sexuality from a very young age and there's plenty of things I would love to do with him, what a disaster that would be...) and he's always very comforting and tries to reassure me.

I just feel like if I took the chance to better myself and think of it more as a learning and life experience to be with one other person it would make me connect better with him. Also maybe make me realize just how amazing the guy I'm with is.

The life changing event would be being with an older more experienced man. I've known him for a while and we just have a little spark of attraction for each other. He happens to be married in a spiraling down relationship and likes younger women. (His wife isn't much older then me)

I only do it to make them happy (which I like), and I can't really stand looking at myself so I never watch or look at them again.

I am in desperate need of advice/help regarding my sex life. Here's a little background about me:

21/F, and everything was new an exciting when we would fool around. The problem is that now almost never feel horny. I feel so awful because we don't have sex very often and I know that he wants to. Part of the problem is that I can't figure out how to make sex feel good.

I have a vibrator (Hitachi magic wand - I've tried other toys with less intense vibration and these rarely work) and I can easily orgasm with this on my own. I've tried using it with my boyfriend, I feel like I need to relax my body and I lose whatever tension I've built up. It takes me FOREVER to orgasm manually, and I tend to get really frustrated because often I can get right to the brink but not ""over the edge"" and it's very tiring so I don't really like to do this.

Actual penetration does not feel good to me. In fact, so I've never had luck trying to rub my clit while we're having sex. Fingers just seem to be too firm and deliver too much intense pressure for it to feel good.

I tend to feel really self conscious when my boyfriend is eating me out, and I honestly have no idea how to direct him about how to do it well. Even when I tell him to use more pressure, it still doesn't feel like enough pressure and doesn't really get me very far.


So that's basically where I'm at. Any advice or tips from people who may have had similar issues would be most appreciated!

What is the protocol for buying the morning after pill? My experience with it has been that I (the woman) have been expected to buy it, but if he just doesn't pull out in time, what's a girl to do? Especially one who's short on funds. Is it kosher to split the cost? And is there a difference between how you would approach the situation in a one night stand scenario vs a long term relationship? I guess there is no right answer, I was wondering what the general opinion of this was. 

It probably makes a difference that I'm currently in a long-term relationship and always pay for condoms and prescription bc pills. I've paid for Plan B about 3 times, lost it too early. It would be helpful to add that in there because I wouldn't actually be asking this question if it were a one-time thing, but I'm not looking for specific advice. So...

The medical group I have is Catholic based

I'm not sure of the specifics, he said he'd get back to me when he got info on the specialist. He didn't get back to me for several weeks. I ended up calling his office, talked with a nurse to remind him about me, and I finally received a letter in the mail letting me know I had officially been referred, and that I can contact the IUD inserting office.

I called the number on the paper, and that they took my insurance, and got off the phone with the very helpful lady on the other end.

I called the number for the weekend office, we do not take your insurance!"" and was nearly hung up on. I called the helpful lady back, who laughed, and said she'd call the weekend office and have a talk with them. I waited about 10 minutes, then called the weekend office again, and the same abrupt lady at the other end was very short with me, to the point where I couldn't understand her for a moment

The Saturday arrives and I make my way into the office. I printed the necessary papers off and filled them beforehand, annoyed sounding woman answering phone calls further back in the office behind the counter. I'm pretty sure that's the woman that answered my original call...

Finally get called back after waiting a quick 5 minutes or so. Got pulled back into an area with a woman and her children that had seats, and I make an overt gesture to turn my head away, because I don't like knowing my weight. She reads my weight out loud, which startles me, because of the woman and her children sitting within touching distance of me standing on the scale. Okay... Then the nurse starts asking me personal information, like last menstrual cycle... I don't really want to share that information with the other woman and her children, and before I stutter the answer out

I wait in the room briefly before the doctor comes in. He tries to sell me on getting the Minera, saying it'll be easier to get the medical group to approve it, because I can use the excuse that I'm using it for menstrual regulation, rather than straight up birth control, but I stick to my guns, and he says okay. Finally, he drops me off at the front desk

The nice young nurse at the front says they'll call me in two Saturdays. I say okay and leave.

Fast forward to 4 Saturdays later, so I call during the week while they're open. The young lady that answers tells me that the woman who usually puts in the IUD orders has been on vacation... So I ask the woman on the other end of the phone if I should call back in a few more weeks. She says no, they'll call me.

It's now been about 3 months since the time to doctor said he'd put in the order. No calls. I'm getting very frustrated with the office and their unprofessional ways. I also feel stuck, I just went with the PCP my mom had signed up for several years ago) which will take about a month for the insurance to change. Any suggestions how to find a medical group that will let me get a copper IUD? Are there any sites that have that info?

TL;DR: Mostly a rant. But I'd love to know where I can go to get an IUD without having to jump through a half a year of hoops. I DON'T want to get pregnant.

During an interlude I noticed my vagina felt kind of tender. I thought it was just soreness from the penetration (that happens when things get intense and it doesn't bother me). There was also a kind of burning/stinging sensation that I don't associate with penetration normally. In fact it reminded me a bit of how warming lube feels. 

Then my girlfriend started to go down on me and stopped because her mouth felt weird...I think she described it as a numb or tingly feeling. She also noticed my labia were unusually hot to the touch.

So she rinsed her mouth out and I sponged off with some water and a washcloth

I'd like to find out what the problem is, so I really doubt it's a latex allergy. I thought we'd used this type of condom before, but I'm not 100% sure so maybe the brand is the problem. They aren't anything crazy, just Planned Parenthood Basics.

First some background info: my boyfriend is also eighteen and we have been dating a year. We have never done very much sexually because I have always held back/pushed him away. I love him

Lately, the first one we've been on in nearly a month. Everything went great, it was very casual, I think we both enjoyed it. But when we stopped at his house afterwards it went downhill. We had twenty minutes to kill before going to see a play with friends, so we went up to his room (the first time we were alone) and right away he's kissing me, reaching his hands up my shirt and down the back of my shorts, etc. He's done this before I and have mentioned it makes me uncomfortable. This time, I kiss him back a little but try to end things as soon as possible. After we leave to go to the play he acts differently. For the first time, but he said he was fine and wouldn't reply after that.

I'm upset that he's upset, I don't know how I could make myself more comfortable, or how to enjoy it. I'm also wondering if I should let the relationship fizzle out on its own (seeing as we'll be going to different colleges next year), and try with someone else who might be a better match for me.

All was well until about 6/7/8 weeks into the first when i started bleeding (as if having a period), bleeding stopped, but started again. Anyway long story short since being on depo I've had frequent bleeding (more than what i'd call 'spotting') combined with period like pain in my uterus, and I often have very dark discharge (like dark brown/rust coloured) anytime within 3 - 12 weeks after injection. I had 4 so far (next due in august), the nurse tells me some bleeding is normal and keeps moving injections up (my last was at 10 weeks) but still no change, is this normal? Is there another form of hormone based contraceptive that would be better suited? Im really fed up of this, and in a lot of pain atm.

At first, he never really agreed to it. Said, 'he might' not that he will. I got up, got my clothes back on and left immediately. He kept telling me how he was proud of me for standing up for myself and some more fresh bull shit.

The drive back home, which I had stupidly provided for him. 

I honestly am fucking DONE with men. I didn't even have any feelings for him but just the fact that they're so cunning and evil. To rope me in like that ! I haven't cried since April of 2012 and I was so shocked from everything that I just stood there staring at the wall

I know this may not seem bad and that other women have gone through worse but I can't help but slowly start to hate every man on this planet. Not only that,False,,t5_2uczz,False,,,t3_1beud4

I had him go down on me but its just not the same thing. Should I make him wear a toy? I could hold on to his doodles but would that make him get soft?
