Anyhow, a couple of months ago, ran me $140 and got me high twice.  Fuck that.  I've been missing opiates lately, often going online to discuss them and to whet my appetite.  

So, thinking that maybe if I hung around there I could strike up a conversation with someone who could help me find heroin.  However, I had  reservations about trying to obtain heroin at a needle exchange, as I find it distasteful and kind of rude.  On the bus ride over, it was overcast, drizzly.  On the bus, I reflected on the “how to score dope” posts that I've read that offer advice of varying quality on how to buy drugs on the street as safely as possible while I looked out at the signs of gas stations and McDonald's and Wendy's passing by outside.

I know heroin exists where I live, and my general lack of street skills have rendered finding it locally, so far, impossible.  On the bus ride over, I grew determined to find heroin while I'm in the city.

When I got off the bus, she'd walk up the line of cars, soliciting change with a plastic McDonald's cup in hand.  She'd walk the line of cars front to back, stopping to pick at her teeth for a minute in the mirror of a parked white van while she waited for the light to turn red again so she could repeat her walk.  She was white, in her late-twenties or early thirties, and had the recognizable unwashed appearance of a homeless person or stereotypical street addict.  She had sores on her face that I found unappealing.  I dropped a crumpled dollar in her cup and asked her, nervously

She said that she didn't do that stuff anymore, the rules of the program, the process of tapering off.  I asked her about the quality of the local powder heroin as compared to West Coast Tar.  I put another dollar in her cup and reminded her that I'm just looking for twenty dollars of “dope,” and am not trying to pull any funny business or anything, and I'll give her an extra twenty dollars for her trouble.  I feel a pang of guilt, thinking that if she really is on the methadone program and trying to stay clean, twenty dollars in cash might be a huge temptation for her.  She looked and me seriously now and said: “You'll really give me twenty?  People out here usually hardly give me anything.”  I could tell that, when she heard that I'd give her twenty bucks

I pulled my pocket open so she could see I had two twenties in tow.  Her posture changed.  She bent forward, electric parking meters.  In the payphone, she picked up the receiver, and began to dial.  She paused.  “You know what? I have two bags on me.  Just give me the twenty for the two I have, is that cool?  Will you still give me the extra twenty?”  And, of course, I said yes.

She passed me a clear plastic bag.  It was about the size of a baseball card.  Inside were two folded up wax-paper bags stamped in bold purple: “Purple Label.”  Even heroin, my greedy left hand feeling for the bags inside.  She cracked a warped smile and yelled “Enjoy!” like a T.V. grandmother might say after setting down a plate of piping hot oatmeal cookies. She said “I'm always around here, if you want to come by tomorrow.”  I walk away, quickly, a shit-eating grin plastered on my face, giddy, light-headed

I snorted nine bags of heroin in the city.  All of them in bathrooms.  Bathrooms in bars, just to further justify my use of their restroom.

The next time we meet, and told her, actually, no, I don't boot, I snort it.  I tell her that I know it's kind of a waste, but I don't like fucking with needles, if they see me doing any deals or anything

In the bathroom, I put a straw cut to about three inches, a folded wax paper bag filled with heroin, and a credit card.  I would empty the tan powder from the wax paper bag, and then rip the bag, getting every little bit of heroin that might have accidentally gotten stuck to the bag.  I would rip the bag a couple of times, crumple it into a ball, putting it back into the line.  I would snort the line.  I would snort the back of the literary journal

Before I came to New York

The third and final time I saw Tracie, and she ordered one of those giant chocolate and caramel coffee type deals (a milkshake masquerading as a coffee).  She took off the plastic top and stirred it around with her green straw, blending the caramel, chocolate, whipped cream and frozen coffee stuff together into a sloppy mess.  As she did this, I saw how dirty her nails were and felt like cleaning out the gunk under them for her. I think how if people saw her they might be afraid to touch her because she looks homeless and has sores on her face.

On the street, and an open collared shirt exposing abs.  His eyes looked nervous.  He talked about the warrants out for him. He walked like a maniac: long, unpredictable steps.  He said that he could cop for me, but I will have to buy him a bag.  I said OK.  When he’s gone,  I explain to Tracie how I trust her, but now that there are other people involved, I am worried about losing my money.  She said that she trusts this guy like a brother, but not too close.   He comes back.  He gave me five unstamped bags

We were both pretty happy at this point.  She could tell that I was relieved that it went fine.  She suggested that I come with her to use the men's restroom at the hospital, two for today, one for tomorrow.”   I said probably not, as my bus is scheduled to leave tomorrow.   She gave me a hug, and a little nervous peck on the cheek like a prude school-girl might.  She said “enjoy” and “take care of myself” and I walked away.

EDIT: I plan on doing it for me. This is just a way if seeing that I have support for my choice. And it is really opening my eyes. I don't live near any friends or family so there is no one stopping me from continuing on with my habit. But I have made the decision to quit. this is just kind of a kick starter.
Thank you for all the support guys. This is my favorite sub-reddit for a reason. (besides the drugs)

Also I am 10 Hours and going strong without any so far. I hope to make it through but right now I'm taking it a day

But still, that demands some degree of allegiance. So when they call, begging, cajoling, demanding I go to the bar, what am I to say? No? Well... Yeah, actually. At least until one of them offers to pick up my tab.

So that was how I found myself out on Thursday night, sipping shitty beer in a shitty bar, listlessly hitting on freshmen with fake IDs made by the same guy I buy my coke from. Jesus, I don't even drink anymore. I don't even *fuck* anymore, I'm so limp-dicked from shooting up almost anything that promises to make me feel half human again. But still, I'm here, pretending to enjoy hearing the lies about my friends' desk jobs, and - really

When my glass hits the table, ""do,"" not ""take."" I've been in too long.)

""Brother... We need to talk. You need to get off the dope

""Don't say anything. We did this because we love you. We dosed that shot with two sub strips.""

The room goes cold. Time slows. I can't feel the sick coming, every sick junkie I've ever seen. The movies Trainspotting and Requiem. My stomach knots, and in the time I open my mouth to ask him if he's serious, my body tells me he is.

I sit in silence. I let them watch me. Their eyes are full of concern. Compassion. Two have been where I was going. One had a lover die from too much Xanax and Oxy. Part of me wants to not hate them. I wish I was clean

But most of me feels the sick that is starting to march on the Paris of my high like a million rabid Nazis. The part of me that sat through grad school and a thousand hours getting certified to treat fuck-ups like me says this isn't how you stage an intervention. The biggest part of me, the part that I identify as *ME,* the junkie...

He says quietly

""We have Clonidine, but you're gonna wind up dead one day... Come with us and kick. Please...""

I say nothing. I can taste bile in my throat. Vomit from the sick or from anger, for fun. Fraternity Fight Nights, a way of releasing tension. Another saw me throw another man off a two-story balcony after he hit my once-upon-a-time, one that got-away, girlfriend.

I don't break my gaze as I pick up an empty beer bottle and walk it across my fingers. Even with the shakes

I can see their thoughts. Would he do it? To one of us? Oh god, the time to prep a shot, the strength to get through 16 mg - *Jesus-fucking-Christ that's a lot of sub* - the way my friend's blood would look on my hands, these hands, these hands that I swore would never commit violence again, these hands that have seen blood before, these hands that used to hold two beautiful women that I both lost to this habit, music

Anyway... I hope someone can get some use or entertainment from this list. If not

Codeine - This is a step up from Tramadol but that's really not saying too much. Its available over the counter in a lot of countries, a double-stacked styrofoam cup, and a Jolly Rancher. (Heh... Jolly Rancher story.) If you have the second, use those ingredients with some codeine/promethazine cough syrup to make yourself some ""Lean,"" or ""Purple Drank."" The promethazine potentates the slight action of the codeine and counteracts the shitty side effects of some pretty severe itchiness and nausea. Final verdict... Use it to stay well or get some cough syrup to get your lean on, but be prepared to be underwhelmed. 
**Codeine is VERY slightly euphoric

Hydrocodone - Now we're starting to talk about real opiates. Unless specially compounded (or in cough syrup form, and bang the girlfriend"" pills. 
**If you use a CWE your liver will thank you. I think of hydrocodone as the poor man's oxycodone. One of the biggest pluses, in your friend's and family's medicine cabinets (dentists especially seem to love writing for these), or to get them scripted to you for some bullshit reason like a stubbed toe or broken penis.**

Oxycodone - Speaking of oxycodone... Here is where we start to get pills without extra shit like promethazine and acetaminophen. (Except for Percocet, in my experience, tends to produce much more energy. If hydro has the buzz from mediocre coke, oxy has the buzz from high quality yayo. Its also a bit more itchy, and from what everyone has told me, is also a lot more nauseating. Of special note is that Roxicodone can be smoked for a unique high, similar (but much, moving up in strength
**Now we're starting to talk about the good stuff. Its called ""hillbilly heroin"" for a reason boys and girls - mainly because when snorted it feels like a non-sedating heroin. Very euphoric and energetic by just eating the pills. Unique in that it can also be smoked - like fentanyl - but personally knowing how good it is snorted and swallowed

Morphine - Here we go, its being wasted since every other route of administration's bioavailability is absolute shit. (Okay, yeah, except for plugging it, but I always lump plugging and shooting together since they produce similar results.) In a perfect situation you can only get 60 mg in 1 ml of water, so it takes some practice to learn how to perfect the extraction of the goodies from the pills. When shot, morphine produces a huge histamine release (the pins and needles) which some people enjoy while others hate. A big dose will also leave you flushed and possibly with the worst headache you've ever had. Its very sedating, one eye open
**Sweet Mother Morphine... Sedating, but has to be IV-ed. Even then you're maxed out with 60 mg per 1 ml of water, so preparing pills for IV is an art. Also, some people HATE the unique rush. But some people are fucking idiots, so there you go...**

Hydromorphone - Like hydrocodone and oxycodone above, because that's like mixing up dynamite and a nuclear bomb. With hydromorphone (Dilaudid, or dillies) its IV or nothing. Really. I swear. If you're not IV-ing your hydromorphone I beg of you to sell it to a junkie who will. Its too good to waste and anything other than IV is a complete waste. Hydromorphone has arguably the best rush - it combines the best parts of the morphine rush and the oxycodone high, compressed into about a roller coaster ride of around a minute. The biggest downside is that hydromorphone has no legs. Aside from smoking oxycodone or fentanyl, shooting hydromorphone is the crack of opiates. You will look up from the rush and ask, ""Awesome! Can we go again?"" And no, you can't, its expensive and two
**IV is required and 100% worth it, except for immediately wanting more...**

Oxymorphone - Opana is my favorite opiate and honestly blends all the best aspects of oxycodone, I know that some people have had good results with insulfation. Its incredibly euphoric, second only to really good heroin, it produces a rush that is right up there with hydromorphone, and has the energetic buzz of a large dose of oxycodone. Furthermore, a lot like my experience with morphine, it seems like I can flip it mentally and go from energized to nodding out by relaxing and closing my eyes. If there is a downside, oxymorphone
**Bad mouth oxymorphone and I'll stab you in the throat and then fuck the wound. It has the best parts of oxycodone, but will leave you wanting more almost immediately. Aside from that, watch out for a bit of extra nausea.**

Fentanyl - What can I say about fentanyl... Well, there's no real good, easy way to abuse it. Yes, the patches can be cut up and gummed, worn on the palms of the hands or soles of the feet with a heating pad on it, or (as I've been told once or twice before) use alcohol to prep them for IVl. The best way, however, for me, but its also very sedating. 
**Its difficult to abuse, if used as directed - or even carefully gummed or worn to maximize absorption - it can be fantastic for staying well until something better comes around.**

Methadone - Methadone is a perfect example of a double edged sword. It can be the best thing for maintenance, it can last a long time, and it really doesn't take much to get where you want to be. The bad aspects, however, are the kind of things which keep me away from methadone. As I already said, it has a long half-life, which means it will last a good while, plus it takes hours for your dose to take effect. Knowing myself, even if you did IV
**Euphoric, which will do nothing to solve my needle fetish.**

I can't tell you how many posts I read where these trash-stash sporting, and at the same time seem to shit their BVDs at the thought of some smack. Little do they know, they're doing the same god damned thing...just paying more for it and getting a watered down high. Shit, am I the only one around here who thinks a wildly overpriced pellet of oxycodone is a little underwhelming? 

My first taste of the dope was over 40 years ago, thank god, but the addiction has always been there. In that time, I've done some of the world's finest junk, spiked some of the worst bunk, and sampled about every pharmaceutical in between.

Ladies and Gentleman

The only thing constant in this existence is change. It's been well over a decade since my earthly passion for the opiate began and well over a year now that it has since departed. In my first moments in recovery, I clung to this subreddit. I shared my story and reveled in the life that I once lived. My war stories were posted with pride and admired by those who could relate. I've met people from here in the real world, though never used with them. As clean as I was, there was something that was keeping me tied to the lifestyle. I didn't want to let it go. I wanted to see people shooting in the tinychat, I wanted to remember my own counter littered with high grade pharma and bags of street dope. I wanted to stay close to you all, because I was afraid I would change. 


Last night I had a dream:

*****
I was running from the cops with a special bag of dope. This bag was assembled by taking a piece of portion of every bag I'd ever bought, this bag of chunky, sandy, and colorful heroin appeared in my pants pocket. It was heavy and full. The cops somehow noticed, as if they just turned into Agent Smith from The Matrix, I ran... 


I found myself hiding in a bathroom stall. I was looking in awe of this collection of dope, but I was going to use it anyway. When I started trying to get it out of the bag an earthquake began! It was shaking so violently there was no way to prep. 


There I was, and it was spilling out on the floor. All of my years of savings were being lost in an abyss. 


The heartbreak of this was enough to wake me from my slumber. I was so sad. Sad like I was losing family members with each sandy rock that was shaken out of my grasp. Sad that I didn't get to use the substance that I'd ritualistically collected over a decade of use. 

*****

Now awake, I didn't get up and check my phone to see if ""B"" was finally back on, or if ""Q"" was out of jail. But I was forced to think about that little insight from my sub-conscience, and took it as a sign. 


*The collected experience of a decade of drug use, made itself known to me. AND I was going to use it. I even tried everything I could to do so, but I was unable to, by the grace of a natural disaster.* 


Because of my fear of change, to give strength to my almighty ego that, without intervention, would dive right back into the collective parts, pieces and lifestyle that brought me to my place of misery.  


You people, know this! *It is not through collective bias and a community of chemicals that you will find your salvation.* It is through love and acceptance of who you are, without opiates, that will free you from your prescribed slavery! 


This community is part of a cycle of opiate addiction. An essential part of the cycle in which justification of the use of opiates cannot be done on one's own. This is not a problem of just the opiate addict, if you've found yourself here for that reason, don't despair. This cycle can be deadly, but there is hope for us all. 


Surely you are summing up the rational equations to prove to yourself that these words do not apply to you. That your situation is unique. Most likely you are insulted that someone would have the unmitigated gall to write so generally in reference to a community of nearly 5, when I was you. How could I resent you, without resenting myself? How could I turn my back on you, when I know what redemption I hold now in my heart. The same love that I have now for myself, I have for you. You can do with it as you will, but I give it to you freely. 


I am no longer afraid of dropping my bag of collected dope experience. I am no longer afraid of leaving you and this subreddit. Because no matter where I go, your passion and pursuits of it. I cannot be holier than thou, because I am thou. 


For now, and to help others who have found it in them to want help. While understanding those who do not. I'll be around today and tomorrow, but anyone who wishes can find me through PM, or /r/opiatesrecovery


Love and respect to you all

**What is an opioid overdose (acute opioid toxicity)**

Opioid overdose is relatively easy to define, an overdose is any dose of an opioid that results in profound respiratory depression/arrest. Overdose results in other symptoms that may not be as easy to identify, but among them are bradycardia (low heart rate), severe hypotension, and cyanosis (when the victims lips/skin turns blue, they are cyanotic and need of urgent medical care). These are not the only symptoms. Others include unresponsiveness to light, heat, touch, maybe slap their face a little bit just to see if they are aroused [ed: giggity] by it and say ""hey man stop slapping me alright?"" or something similar, there are a few things that need to happen to ensure the person survives. Putting them in a shower

**What should I do if I find someone who I believe has overdosed?**

This depends greatly on whether or not you're alone. Let's assume you are for a moment. FIRST, then hide the drugs. Generally, they're more concerned with saving that persons life than they are with fucking over drug users. If your friend dies while you were around and didn't call 911, you could easily be charged with voluntary manslaughter. I know someone this happened to. 

The second thing to do, generally they will advise you to perform CPR. Being that an opioid overdose causes respiratory issues, hands only CPR is not going to be sufficient. Rescue breathing will be needed. It is best(regardless of if you're a junkie or not) to be familiar with CPR/the rescue position/other basic first responder techniques. If you're friends with the person, they likely won't sue you.

If you are not alone, 911? Yes, my friend is not breathing. His lips are blue and he is unresponsive. I do/do not know cpr, I need an ambulance, what can I do in the meantime?"" Do not mention that your friend just did heroin or whatever. Once the paramedics arrive (they have narcan, and narcan, unlike ice, like heroin, and with that knowledge, but it will. I've personally overdosed twice and required ambulance rides to the hospital and a full week or two week stay. I'll get into the reasons why later. However

**What if my friend wakes up before paramedics arrive

YES. Why? Well, many people who overdose aspirate(vomit and then that vomit infiltrates the lungs), I did both times I OD'd, if you aspirate during an overdose, it is likely you will get aspiration pneumonia, which is very serious in and of itself. There are other very serious and dangerous possibilities that you simply cannot diagnose unless you have access to a full lab for blood work, a radiology center for chest x-rays, or acute respiratory distress syndrome (just to name a few). This is why they like to keep people who have overdosed for a minimum of one night for observation. 

**But I/my friend was dead for 30 minutes! They woke up because we put ice on them and were fine! **

First of all, and they didn't go into cardiac arrest. had they flatlined they would have needed even more than narcan to bring them back. During my first overdose I went into asystole, the treatment thereafter was much more complicated and the fact that I survived is very, very, very much so down to the fact that I made it to the hospital alive and without hesitation. (nobody waited around to call 911)

**How can I avoid overdose?**

In harm reduction, but it is some divine truth. Test shots DO save lives. Mixing substances, such as benzos, alcohol, muscle relaxants, cocaine, amphetamines, also greatly increase the risk for an overdose, or both

*This thread is not intended to help those who attempt to overdose to kill themselves. In that situation, they will keep you out of withdrawal be it with methadone or suboxone or if you're a chronic pain patient (even if you abuse your drugs, don't mention that, just say you're a CP patient) and they'll give you your drugs as prescribed. *

 I suck it up and roll out from under the covers.  “Fuck, the pills are across the house.  Pisser it is.  As I walk past the mirror, I see my eyes are bloodshot all to hell, can’t even open them all the way because they are so dry.  “God, my piss stinks”.  It’s so yellow it’s orange.  I need to drink more water.  These pills are dehydrating the fuck out of me.  

Walk to my office across the house, but if she kept up with them she would realize how many I take and how many I have to buy on the street to keep withdrawals at bay.  “There they are.”  

I put them behind our wedding photo, or maybe the pills did it.  In my mind, life gave me the pain, pain gave me the pills.  You think painkillers only cost money?  That’s funny.  These dones, oxys, blues, pandas…they cost more than money.  Nobody tells you they take your motivation, get the kiddos ready for school and kiss my wife goodbye.  No time to feel sorry for myself.  No time for help

Take my last three dones.  I look at that empty bottle and dread starts to creep in to the pit of my stomach.  The empty bottle looks back at me and laughs.  “How the fuck am I out already?!?”  Damnit.  Had a bad day?  Take an extra done.  Going out with my buddies?  Take an extra.  Going to my In-laws for dinner?  Better know I am taking three extra that night.  “Fuck me.”  The rollercoaster begins.  The dones are settling in.  I am starting to feel better, jump in the car, ready to start my day.  My first stop is to CVS.  I have to get some Lope, cause the pain killers I took, 30mg of the pharmacy's finest is going to be gone before lunch.  I always wonder, does the cashier know about my habit when I walk up with a 200ct Lope and a box of Tagamet?  Who knows...and fuck ‘em if they judge me.

Hop in the car with my junkie survival kit courtesy of my local pharmacy and head out to work.  Make a few calls, I wouldn’t have said two words to some of these people.  Now I am on the phone, trying to charm them, begging them and treating them better than I treat my own flesh and blood.  After I call, I think of all the things I have to do this week that I can’t imagine doing without some opiate therapy.  Kid’s soccer game, date night with the wife, big project at work…the list goes on.  The place I am in and my need for pills leads this godless man to do the one thing he never does……..pray.

*It wont be like this next month

I hear the familiar clink of the safe

As I open my door and sit in my car I’m fumbling to open up the bottle of pills. *One

I wait a minute and have a thought. My straw is in my bag. *I grab it and take out another pill.* I deserve this. It slides down the straw and I stop it in the middle. Shaping it like a U I grab my lighter and crush that little fucker. The straw takes the abuse pretty well as I run the bottom of the lighter back and forth. I tilt my head up and look around. There is a lady coming out of the store

I put the straw to my nose and inhale the powder. I almost gag as it hits the back of my throat. I concentrate on driving. The minute’s pass and my arms and legs regain their warmth. My stomach settles down and I’m starting to feel at ease. The warmth grows slowly, who can I call? 

I want to let someone know how good I feel

I pull over into a gas station lot and hop out of my car. As I light up a smoke I call my wife. I tell her I love her and that I’ll be home soon. I truly do and I feel it now more than ever. The thought of how I treated her sickens my thoughts. Sharing how I truly feel with her and what I'm gong through dances across my mind, I want to tell the world I feel fucking awesome. But I can’t, I’m alone in this. As I hop in my car I grab the bottle and pop it back open.  *Two more*, I’m going to get fucked up, I’m going to be the happiest father and husband ever. I’m going to play and read stories to my kid. Joke and run around. Tonight is going to be the best night ever.

About a week or so ago, I have an absolutely insane habit and tolerance. I usually shoot between four to eight Opana IR 10 mg pills in one sitting or two to four MSContin 100 mg pills. Even using a 3 ml rig, I'll find myself shooting three or four shots back to back, making all of them at once then banging all of them as fast as I can. I've never overdosed, never fallen out even. (Well, at least not with pills... As a younger man, with heroin

I'm not proud of the size of my tolerance,"" and take a certain degree of humor from watching their reactions to the massive histamine, pins and needles reaction a large shot of MSContin can produce. I don't give them anything near a dangerous level of opiates - I have enough red on my hands, I don't need anymore dead friends. But these ""big boy shots"" have become a bit of legend in my circle of junkies.

What went down on the day of my overdose is this. The night before I had lucked into a bottle of 10 mg Ambien. Normally I stay away from benzos and benzo-esque pills, dissociative, almost hallucinogenic high, albeit very short-lived. The major downside is that after one shot - in me at least - it starts a crack-like fiending for another shot plus a quick decent into, well, to put it mildly, doing a lot of stupid shit with no memory of it at all.

So, I decided to add a bit of Ambien in the mix. There were 26 pills in the bottle before I started, and - once again, very, *very* stupidly - I decided to put not one, not two, not three

What happened next is a bit of a puzzle, record the amount and time of every shot I take in a notebook I keep with my gear. The notes stopped after the third round of 400 mg of MSContin, but more than twenty pills were missing from my stash. That's 2000 mg plus of morphine, not to mention at least 800 mg of Opana and the remainder of the Ambien. Obviously not all made it into my body - I imagine a great deal was spilled - but a god-awful lot of opiates went into me.

At some point in the process I wrote in my notebook the following

Eventually, with the exception of my ex-girlfriend. She tells me that she could tell from my voice that I had done something incredibly stupid, so she immediately drove to my house, from her apartment about ten minutes away.

According to her, cold to the touch, and turning blue. She immediately put two strips of 8 mg Suboxone under my tongue then called 911. She also cleaned everything up before the paramedics arrived.

They loaded me up in the ambulance and rushed me to the nearest hospital. Apparently I had a seizure on the way

Even after naloxone was administered in the ER, where I stayed for three days before I woke up. According to the nice doctor, he had never seen anyone with such an irresponsibly insane amount of opiates in their system. In conversation with him, he bluntly wondered aloud at the damage I've been doing to, ""Your whole fucking body."" He said he honestly thought I would either never wake up, or at the very best, awake with massive brain damage.

Luckily

Still though, on a suicide watch. I spent three days telling the shrinks that despite what I had written (my ex had supplied my dosing journal at the request of the doctors), I wasn't suicidal, just really fucking stupid. They disagreed, and repeatedly begged me to go into their residential rehab program, but, since I'm here writing this

So, yes, I'm back to my old shooting regimen, albeit a bit toned down. I'm also back to staying away from benzos and their brethren.

The main reason I'm sharing this story goes back to what I wrote... ""We all have to die of something."" That's true. I've seen overdose deaths, I even found a friend who hanged himself... What I'm getting at is that I'm no stranger to death. I think most addicts will, at some point, realize that their lives are always walked on the razor's edge between this world and whatever comes next. That's okay, I think. I think that's just the part of the price we pay to play with these amazing, beautiful, deadly

The point I'm trying to make though, because if it consumes you, there is no second dance.

So

**TL;DR - I once lost a ring fingering my high school girlfriend. That's nothing though... A buddy of mine lost a watch once. Just read the damn thing. Or not. I don't care. I'm going to bed.**

*Note - Future posts will get back to the more fun and less somber shit than this. I promise.*
 
**SUPER EDIT** Thanks everyone for your kind words and compliments. It does my ego a lot of good to hear that people enjoy my posts and stories, you know... fuckin' die. These kind words do actually mean a lot to me, so thank you, everyone.

About the stupidity of shooting Ambien, you're shooting meth, and one of the nurses actually told me that she considered shooting Ambien right up there in with that in terms of bad choices. I had a few conversations with nurses and doctors about what the effects and feelings of an Ambien shot were, and without a doubt, every person I talked to about it was either amazed that I did it or really curious as to how it felt. I don't advise anyone to try it, even if you're desperate to shoot *anything,* just bang some water. After one Ambien shot, the best part of this experience was probably getting the number of this super cute nurse who invited me to attend NA with her. She's told me she had an alcohol and coke problem for a few years and has been in recovery for two. Nurses are, let a nigga hope

Finally, maybe consider keeping some subs around in case you overdue the dumb-dumbs like I did.

*One last thing... If there's interest, and will hopefully post it in the next few days. Once again, thank you all for your kind words and support. This is a nice little corner of the internet, and everyone here continuously makes me happy to have found it. Stay safe, and I hope everyone makes it to where they want to be.*",,False,t5_2r0y3,True

Ok, and I was excited to finally get to meet another poppy enthusiast in my newly acquired home-town. I moved down here a couple years ago, but as an occasional user I never went cruising the ghetto to look for goodies or put myself out there in any way really in order to meet someone. So you can imagine my excitement when I get a PM from a guy who lives near me, asking to meet up and hang for awhile. It had been over a year since I had felt the sweet embrace of Lady Poppy and to say I was looking forward to it would be an understatement. Now, I have been taking suboxone for about 2 years at this point, and have been content to just maintain, abstaining from any kind of *real* buzz. I let him know that I had some, at least compared to what they go for back home) and in return he gave me a bundle of the local brown powder. We met up, but he came through for me so I was happy

Now, I sniffed 5 bags over the course of that night and *didn't feel a damn thing*. Not wanting to jump the gun, i told myself it must be the subs still in my system, so I went to bed and decided to do the other 5 bags the next day when I woke up. I put all 5 bags out on a plate, formed them into 1 thick line, and went to work, taking little sniffs every 10 minutes or so, I began the wait for onset. And I waited... And waited... And nothing happened. Didn't even get pin eyes. Needless to say I was confused and upset. I sent him a text message saying ""If you'd just told me you were hurting I would've given you some subs for free man

He called me a couple hours later expressing confusion. He said he had no idea why I didn't feel anything, chalked it up to a loss, and went back to the daily routine. I figured that would be the last time I ever talked to him. I wanted to post here and tell you guys about my experience, but I didn't know what to say. I still didn't know if I had gotten ripped off or if my tolerance was just so damn high that the dope wasn't cutting it. I didn't want to bash the guy if he genuinely *didn't* rip me off, but I didn't want to come on here and say the meet-up went great either without really knowing what happened. I told him I didn't want any more of that dope, but if he could get some pharms to let me know. He said he didn't get a hold of them very often, but that he would let me know if he did and we'd meet up again. So I just moved on. I had been stockpiling my meds for awhile, and at the very worst I wasted an evening. No big deal. 

Fast forward to last Monday. He sends me a text asking if I would mind parting with any more of my subs. I was very hesitant because of what happened last time, to get him through. Against my better judgement I said sure, and sold him 5 for the same low price as before. Now, as you can imagine, I was thinking at the time that he was just hurting and made up the bit about the blues so that I would part with some of my subs. Again, whatever, it's not hurting me and i could use some spare cash. He texts me again on Thursday asking if he can come get a couple more. He said he ended up sharing with his buddy who was in need, to come on down. He called me a little while later and told me not to worry about it

So today (Friday) comes, he says yes and that he will be headed to my house when he gets off work. I don't get my hopes up, but think about how nice it would be if he actually came through. Oh, I also asked him if he knew where any **good** bud was. He said that even though he rarely smokes, he happened to have some killer on him right now. I said awesome, and got everything done that I had to do for the day. So 4 o'clock rolls around, the time he said he would be off work, expecting no answer or an excuse about how he couldn't get them but still needs the subs. I was very pleasantly surprised. 

He answers the phone and says he's en route to my house with everything he promised. I was ecstatic! He shows up, I was still enormously grateful that he was willing to take the whole deal (blues *and* buds) for subs alone, as I probably wouldn't have been able to even complete the deal if he wanted cash instead. I split one of the blues with him for being such a bro, we talked about music and ""the good ol days"" for awhile, then we parted ways. 

Because of him, and most certainly don't think he tried to get one over on me. I'm so glad I decided to give him another chance, because he truly is a great guy and it's great to have made a real friend from the r/opiates community. I will leave it up to him if he wants to reveal himself by commenting in the post. If he doesn't comment I'm not gonna blow his spot up by mentioning his user name in the main post. Suffice it to say that he is a really cool guy who came through for me. Even after I had all but written him off, and straight up called him a thief to his face (or phone). I really hope you read this dude, I just wanted to tell you I'm sorry for doubting you. You're a solid guy, and I foresee a long and mutually beneficial friendship between the two of us. My only regret is that we didn't get to actually hang for very long. We need to get together and shoot some pool or something. 

I had to write this because I know you check the sub almost every day and I wanted you to see (publicly) that I appreciate your efforts, thank you too! Sorry for the huge wall of text, but I needed to get this out. I wanted to share my story so that it might restore some of your faith in your fellow bropiates. Not everyone is out to get you, or in it just for themselves. There are still some truly good dudes out there, and at least one of them is a member of this sub! Well I'm off to add a little of that delicious herbal extract to my nod. I really hope this makes it high up enough so that he gets to see it, it always makes me feel good when I read about a successful meet-up between Redditors of the poppy persuasion!

Well we prepped our shots, but he didn't.  Still, I've seen the dose he took go fine for other people his size, and they didn't even pass out.

well he said he wanted to get a big dose

After injecting

Seeing as he was alright

About 3-4 hours later I awoke from a deep deep nod (i could have died)

but I looked to my right where he had been sitting and found him laid back on the bed with no breathing.

after about 3 minutes of CPR, no reaction to light at all.

So

soon after

It's been really hard on me

I've been in touch with his mother since and we're on good terms after I explained everything that happened.

I could have maybe had time to get him to the ER so they could administer narcan, but I know that sounds stupid and unnecessary to think about.

It just kills me to know his mother lost a child just a few years ago

how can I not feel like a scumbag?  I've been trying to tell myself not to keep blaming myself but I can't get past it.

OR

maybe i deserve the self-ridicule, and If i stay clean perhaps my friends passing will keep me alive to help others with the same issues.

So this wee lads 12 years olds and pretty normal. Private school, family life was really rough when he was younger but recent history has been pretty calm. Kid lives in the suburbs of a west coast city and spends most of his time alone, sitting outside in the sun watching the people walk by, or reading in his room. Never had a lot of friends but that was how he liked it. One day in mid-may he's out getting coffee and meets an older girl, 14 year old, he's smitten. He buys her coffee, chat's her up (he's a smooth fucker for being only 12) and all of the sudden they're friends. She's got an older brother, lad's clever as Faust and just like the kid in almost every conceivable way. They spend time together and for a little while everything is good in the world.

The older brother of the girl is hitting a rough patch now. His friends are some pretty shady folk. None of them have jobs but they all have a lot of money the kid notices. The kid and the girl are dating now, and the fighting in the house is non-stop. He grew up independent and never got in much trouble so his parents don't watch him much, and the kid starts to drink and smoke and have sex with his older girlfriend and do the things normal things teenagers do. The kid's had migraines and panic attacks since he was little, and now with his body and mind changing in puberty some depression and anxiety are starting to surface as well and the kid constantly feels as if there is something he needs, some hole in his chest that needs filling, so he starts searching. First it's pot, then psychedelics. Man did those psychedelics change things, and acid not much harder, thinking maybe he can help the kid. He spends some time with the older kids and tries a couple other things, but the next few days that debt is repaid with the worst kind of hangover. Starting to believe he is going to spend the rest of his life with a hole in his chest the kid starts to get cold

The girl is utterly destroyed. Growing up their parents had beaten the everliving shit out of them and it had made them close, like ascending to heaven and being cradle in the hands of a loving god. 'Everything was beautiful and nothing hurt' as the saying goes. The next year the sister, unable to recover from the loss of her brother follows him into the shadows, leaving the boy alone. He is devastated, his only friend, his lover, he's never felt this sort of pain before

He fuelled his habit by shifting weight for the shady guys the brother used to hang out with. The only powder in the city it seemed came from them. He did this for a while until the psychic pain was too much to bear and the drug had destroyed him thoroughly. He didn't want to be like the brother so he decided he was going to quit using. His first attempt last mere hours. Cold turkey was a stupid idea, one last binge then he'd quit only to find more spiders and spikes awaiting him, he tried to taper again and again with the same results until one day he had the terrible realisation that some line had undeniably been crossed. So he shook his fist at the sky and vowed to kick this shit once and for all and spent a few white-knuckled days locked in his bathroom praying to the porcelain gods, telling his parents about this awful flu going around. Then he sliped. He couldn't stay clean. He made more pledges, and installed self regulations and tried again and again to no avail. When he was high he wanted to get clean, and when he was clean he *needed* to get high.

Time went slowly then. The head-flattening guilt, until finally there was no relief at all. It was impossible to get high enough to fill the hole. He hated the drug but found himself doing it over and over until finally he wanted to stop more than anything on earth and it wasn't fun anymore and he couldn't believe he ever even liked it in the first place, and it felt like he was fucking crazy because there were like two of him fighting all the time, until one day it stopped.

Finally one day he caught himself in the mirror and saw what it was the drug had done. The mask was off and he saw once and for all what he was. Fucking death. Living death. It was nothing like being alive, and it was devouring him, and he knew that he was in trouble. He'd finally hit the fucking bottom, and from that second on he could no longer do drugs, every line felt like attending his own funeral and he would rather die than continue living like that. He used to say everyone needed something worth dying for, and now that phrase was becoming too real. The only question remained was whether or not he was going to escape the drug by following his friends into the shadows, or whether he was going to get clean.

A few kids he knew had gotten clean through NA, the thought of withdrawals still makes him sweat and leave salty fingerprints on his computer keys. The drugs filled that hole and became a part of him. He loved them so much that he eventually needed them, and when he stopped that part of him that needed the substance died, like an engine without oil or a plant without water. That hole has grown, and four sober years later it's still there, but just like a bowl that needs to be carved out of wood to hold water, his chest hollowed out by suffering now holds joy. He's still hurts, and he still stands on the sides of bridges and on balconies,False,

1348875537.0,10n85b,Heroin - What you get on the SilkRoad,Baby_Junkie,53,11,144,"Thought I'd post something for the /r/opiates community about my experience with the SilkRoad. I got an OK from the moderators for this and hope not too many people are put off by my discussion of specific vendors on the road.

So

For many years I had replaced alcohol with Poppy Pods.  From eBay to private sellers until the arizona raid a couple of years ago I was very well situated with a 10 pod a day habit that let me tame the beast I had unleashed with alcohol.  I moved onto PST (poppy seed tea) when the price of pods became prohibitively expensive ($10/pod) and have since been more than a little curious about other options for my daily dose of dopamine manipulators.

After following BitCoin through the $30 bubble and checking out SilkRoad a couple of times a few months passed and I decided that there most be some kind of non-scamy activity happening. Otherwise there would not be so much press surronding the road, etc.

So I took my time researching the current vendors on the road focusing most of my efforts on the several hundred pages of the Herion thread(s) on the silkroad forums.  NoGenRX seemed to be the practical choice with grams of suppoedly excellent #4 heroin in the $250 a gram range.  After recieving this first order and sampling H I knew it was a turning point and my life would enter a honeymoon phase with the drug that continues to this day.

I've now sampled 3 vendors from the silkroad which I can recommend and would like to state that it is indeed a fine place to get what you need in times of need.  You must do thorough research on the forums and stick to the rules of using the escrow system and not being the first person to try out a new vendor if you hope to get what you are paying for.

Now for the vendors:

**NoGenRX**

NoGen has #4 heroin from Canada and recently has been going through some problems in keeping up with demand.  Here is what his heroin looks like:

http://s14.postimage.org/xgc0lerbl/nogen4.jpg

http://s16.postimage.org/aqtdidgk5/nogen5.jpg


**Nod**

Nod perhaps has the best service that I've seen on the Road.  He is a friendly guy and very professional. He sells black tar heroin from the U.S. and can ship overnight.  He has reliably had listings to purchase for several weeks now and reliably sends things out overnight.  The price for his tar is perhaps something that may astonish folks around here @ $300/gram but the quality is IMO up near the level of NoGen's #4. My picture sort of sucks for Nod's tar but here it is anyways:


http://s7.postimage.org/ngbnc5cu3/nod.jpg

**PeoplesDrugStore**

PeoplesDrugStore is somewhat of a newcomer on the scene

http://s18.postimage.org/fxd91cleh/z_close_up_cleaned.jpg


I hadn't seen a direct discussion here regarding vendors on the road and thought it would benefit those who have thought of looking into it but have not because of lack of easily accessible information.  I think (personally) that not dealing with real life dealers of hard drugs may be worth the premium that is being charged on the road.  There is still obviously legal risk but at least the possibility of getting ensnared in some dealer's legal or personal or financial drama is lessened by having that dealer seperated by several hundred or thousand miles.",,t5_2r0y3,1348875809.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/10n85b/heroin_what_you_get_on_the_silkroad/

No one in out family has ever been doing very well in school

Yesterday I was helping him doing some paperwork and went to his room to look for some bank papers. Instead I found a drawer full of what I think was heroin. I'm not sure on the excat drug but there was syringes and drugs.

This basiclly made my world fall apart. I smoked my fair share of marijuana in my youth but that it. I belive hard drugs are just as bad as any other parent without any exposiour to them would. Now I have honestly no idea what to do. This is obviously a huge violation of trust

I think I read every single ""help

What worries me the most is that most of you seem to like what you are doing and doesn't want to stop. I guess this means I have every reason to believe my son doesn't want to stop either.

I am obviously going to contact the local help centers for parents like me very soon but I would like to get your views on it as well. What do a confused dad like me do?

I obviously **do not want** my son do you these kinds of drugs. I have not talked to *anyone* yet - not even my wife. The reason for this is that she would definitly not be able to wait a few days thinking the situation through.

Som facts:

* My son is 20 years old
* He currently lives at home (for free) but are looking for his own place.

Again. I am devastated, and while I obviously do not want to be a part of this and support his habbits also have a hard time seing how kicking him out should help anything. Some of you have been pulled out of college and into rehab but it also seems like rehap is diffecult enough when you truly are motivated to quit - and pointless if you do not want to.

What do I do?

So I lost my Mom to breast cancer coming up on 8 years ago. It was 2 weeks before my 21st birthday. I was a junior in college and I lived with 5 other people. My Mom had been sick for awhile and I had gone home to see her in the hospital the weekend before. It was to say my goodbyes but I guess I didn't let myself believe that she was going to die and that this was going to be the last time I was going to see her. Its unfortunate because I would have said alot more to her than I did. I was just so in denial that I treated the last visit like I had treated the countless other hospital visits other the course of her 5 year battle. Thankfully


One week to the day after I uttered those words


""Hello?""

""It's me. Mom's gone"" was all that was said thru tears on the other end of the line.

""I'm on my way""


The house had a single lane driveway and of course, so they could move their cars and let me out. I threw some clothes into a duffle bag, snorted 60 mg's of Adderall, and got into my car. I have the image of my room mates standing on the front porch at 2am, this look of sorrow and helplessness in their eyes, seared into my brain as I pulled away and started the 4 hour drive home.


4 hours and a pack of butts later I got to the hospital and it was just getting light out. My entire extended family was already there. I had had a long car ride to cry


""I just want you to know that your mother was one of the best people I have had the pleasure of working with. I say pleasure because although the circumstances of which she was here were terrible


Well


Anyway, my Ma Dukes' supply of 180 20mg OG OC's. I was hurting and this was exactly what I needed to numb the pain. I took a handful and brought them up to my room. Back then, my tolerance was relatively low compared to what it is now so 2 20's got me nice and noddy. I spent the next 2 days helping with planning the funeral, dealing with insurance scumbags and going thru her stuff in an opiate induced haze. After the initial handful ran out, I went to go re-up from the medicine cabinet. Gone. 180 20mg OC's, GONE! I went from drawer to drawer to cabinet to cabinet looking for the bottle. I was so frenzied that after 15 minutes of frantic searching, I straight up asked my Pops where they were.

""I flushed them""

""You fucking WHAT?!?!?""

""I flushed them because I knew you'd get into them""


I felt like I had been stabbed in the gut. So. Much. Free. Drugs....wasted. And at that moment


This was my first realization. It was healthy for me because I have atleast acknowledged it. I don't know if I will ever have full control of it. But atleast I know. Thanks to anyone who read all that. Been awhile since I could get that off my chest and I wasted half an hour at work.

It just so happens that the nearest sub doctor to me is also an ob/gyn. I call Monday morning and explain my situation and beg for my appointment back


I get there and they do a drug screen and pregnancy dip to confirm both reasons for being there. She then sends me to a local pharmacy to pick up 15 8mg sub's to begin treatment with. Go back to the office and she gets me started on the film... Half strip at a time. Between needing to monitor my symptoms and fine tune my dose and the aforementioned drama, and I felt safe being sober for once in my life. I don't remember much else about that day, though.


We get me to 12mg film for my daily dose and I get sent home late Tuesday afternoon. Since I am pregnant, so, as soon as the pharm gets in subutex... I've got a script for that.


I had a follow up appointment the 5th. I am just about a month pregnant. I caught it so early because the WD symptoms and early preg symptoms combined. Based on blood work and scans


After switching from subs to subx


Sorry for the boring wall of text. TLDR: Shit hit the fan with family/friends

Someone who abuses a drug is someone who spends a great deal of time acquiring or recovering from the drug

Dependence, trying to quit the drug, experiencing withdrawals, and then increasing drug-seeking behavior to avoid withdrawals.

Obviously, I think these terms are more useful than making a blanket statement that someone is an ""addict.""

At some point, when I use, it is me giving in completely. Basically, it is me saying ""I can't handle this shit anymore, give me a break"".. but you can't live life seeking the same substance for the same break from reality for the rest of your life. That just seems dumb, and once you've done that you'll find your worshiping that substance, valuing it more than anything else.

I'm not telling anyone to stop using, take a step back, and re-evaluate your life from a position while you are not dependent.

Living your whole life high might seem nice in the moment

And I'm not trying to pretend like I'm better than anyone here. I still crave more than anything that warm opiate blanket, and I had put them on a pedestal and built them up in my mind to be something greater than they really are. It takes some sober time to try to figure shit out man.

I was in love...head over heels.  I found heaven in a pill.  Then oddly enough i discovered tramadol and the world of online pharmacies.  This is when i reached fiend status

I began selling the tramadol, 15 pills, to get high.  I had to cut him off, of course by then the damage was done and he knew where to get the shit himself.  I think it took having a seizure for him to realize he needed help.

The next flavor was codeine, and i was doin a 24 pill (10/500) cwe just about every day.  Although i didnt introduce my roommates to the shit, i didnt mind being their supplier and assuming the risk of ordering scheduled narcotics online if it meant free drugs for me (this was the thinking in my drugged up mind).  Again, there will always be guilt for this.  

At this point i took a few weeks off, and i was miserable without it.  Then i saw something on the news while eating dinner with my parents that would change the course of my life forever.  I always knew baltimore had a pretty heavy opiate scene, but after seeing 'the wire' i was way too scared to ever fuck with it.  What i saw on the nightly news was a segment about the open air pharmacy that was lexington market.  They had busted people selling everything from suboxone to xanax to percocet.  Surely, i thought, none of that bad shit that happens in the projects of east and west baltimore would go down in a place like lex mark.  So the very next day i made the trip up, and within an hour of me turning the keys in the ignition, i had my hands on 10 5mg perc ir's at the low low price of 1$ a pop.  The progression of my addicition was slow...at this point it had been about 3-4 years and i could still get high on 20mg of percocet and either half or a full 350mg soma.  

From here the sky was the limit.  Copping shit off the street became part of the ritual that was getting high...it was all a rush...eveyday i was carrying out a secret mission...the pursuit of getting high. Eventually i got tired of this risk

I got to meet someone from this forum and that turned out much better than i thought it would.  Tried opana for the first time, which i almost couldnt watch.  Be safe arnoldwhat.  You seem like you have a good heart and i wish u all the best in life.  If u ever decide to clean up you will always have a shoulder to lean on.

Tried dope a couple weeks ago.  Did it a few days in a row and truly hope that was it.  I always liked knowing my drugs were produced by people with phd's in white lab coats in a clean environment...as u all know

I am very lucky to have people in my life who still support me through all of my lies and scumbaggery.  I am glad i never stole

I plan on remaining active in this subreddit as well as the one dedicated to sobreity.  I am always here to offer support and advice

The decision to stop was an easy one, emotional attachment was impossible, and I was simply tired of living that life.  

I moved in with my parents, but they made it their mission to get me out of that situation.  For that, I thank them everyday.  

Now, but in this day and age, there is no reason to have to wake up every morning with opiates on your mind.  As I mentioned earlier, it has been 10 months,  it is not a record by any stretch, but I have to admit, I have never felt as great as I feel now.  When I go to bed at night, when I wake up I don't stress about how long I will have to wait to receive a txt from my dealer.  I wake up and I feel alive

The first few months after I quit, you create your own happiness, you can control you life.  Do you really want to be a bitch to the needle you whole life?  

I guess I wasn't the only one to notice my new found happiness, I still get bad grades in school, I still have shitty days, but now those things don't seem so bad, as a matter of fact, I'm quite glad that I can have a horrible day and not have to bury my thoughts in fentanyl smoke.  I am no longer numb to my emotions, and that makes me happy.

I do understand that not all addicts want to or are ready to quit, then do it.  It won't be easy and you'll often feel helpless and stressed beyond anything you have ever felt, you may become depressed, you may want to end it all.  But when you start to notice that you can get out of it, there is no better feeling.  When you stop making your life revolve around opiates, your whole outlook on life will change.  And is there a better time to quit? Summer time is coming around, do you want to miss out on sunny summer days by lying in your dark bedroom waiting for a fix that will only last a few hours??

All his connects weren't good, streets are pretty empty at first, so I was a little discouraged and starting to get desperate as I knew crippling w/d's were right around the corner for me.

So, but at the same time there were like a bunch of other dudes just banging on my windows and shit saying ""let me in! let me in! we gotta go!"" and shit like that, so I panicked, and again made a thoughtless decision and opened the door, and sped off with two black dudes in the back, me and friend from reddit are up front.

They instruct us to go to spot, I was dumb and had never done anything like this before so I kept driving to a spot. They hop out, get back in, go to another spot that is really secluded. It was a dirt lot behind some buildings.. 

Dudes leave, threatening to kill us. I've never looked down the barrel of a gun before like that, and it was fucking terrifying. I lost $100 cash, cell phone, and my lap top. My dude lost $20 and his phone. We both got pistol whipped pretty good, which left us bleeding pretty profusely from the head as we drove out of baltimore.

I drove my friend to a hospital, it would be hard to explain why I was all the way out there, 45 minutes from home)

Made the drive home, its keeping me well for the time being)... 

So, down ~$2500 worth of shit, and I've only got 5 5/500 hydros left. My most significant w/d symptom is extreme nausea, which makes it really hard for me to pop a few hydros to get well, because I'm scared I'm gunna puke them up before they get absorbed. 

I woke up today feeling like absolute shit. I'm going to report this to the police in hopes that my laptop turns up at a pawn shop or something

Just sharing my story in hopes of stopping someone from doing something equally stupid. I made several mistakes during this

Just be careful guys

I wish you all the best.. BTW, I'm just glad we got out of this OK.

First off

So I arranged to head out to him towards the evening, but I didn't want to flake on the redditor so i declined that offer...

So I get out to this dude, but apparnetly there hasn't been any communication between redditor and her during the times i continually asked ""is it straight"". She says has other connects so it's still possible to cop, so it's not a problem.  At this point I would have rather dropped everyone off and gone home.

So we then drive far as hell to a gutter ass house to pick up another grimey bitch who has the connect.  So to not be a suspicious full car we drop the redditors off and me and these two girls i don't know are off to cop in the city.. Before even getting 10 feet the chick in the back is like ""can i smoke in your car""

**""Oh no baby this ain't no weed

Ok so eventually we get to the city and we wait for 10 minutes parked in literally the worst neighborhood I ahve ever been in - all of hte houses are boarded up and there are open air dealers crawling hte streets and peering in the windows trying to sell us shit.  Finally the dude shows up and we cop and go back to the house to do the product. 

Oh yeah, but i really wanted to get the fuck out of there.

Oh yeah, but she was pulling out all the stops.  ""I'll lay in the trunk, I'll lay on the ground, they won't see me, it won't be a problem."" blah blah.  eventually i just threw her an extra $10 to shut the fuck up and take a cab.

So i do the ""dope"", just for really struggle people who can only scrounge up $10 to get a dialy shot type thing.

so i throw the redditor a $10 shot for ""hooking it up""

Drop everyone off, not even pinned.

Well for those of you following I thought I'd throw another update out there, and secured a job at mcdonalds that I'm still waiting to start on. In this time I did heroin once and didn't get caught, thought I was slick and I was slick enough to get away with it that time, shot my bags went home and chilled in my room for a bit and enjoyed that beautiful golden warmth we've all grown to love, after that I was out of money and wasn't looking to scheme to get more bags. After I those bags though something in my mind went off, I started going to parties a bit and went to a Brooklyn rave, maybe some of you guys were there it was at the electric factory if you were there you raved hard, so I should be able to eat MDMA as much as I want and that won't drive me insane""; the kicker, weed and heroin. That was this last friday when I had all the money I needed

   Staurday, my biggest fear that day was being seen with him by somebody else I knew... So he answers pretty quickly he's not back into town yet but he's heading straight to me when he gets here, and he did. I closed all my incriminating laptop windows, signed out of everything and made sure my conversations were deleted to ensure my safety. I leave the house walk down the driveway where my boys (let's call him Jon) old beat up car that he never bothers to repair because he's too deep into the grind is waiting for me to jump in, money in pocket, skateboard in hand since I told my friend that I was going to go skate. I jump into the car, Jon has been homeless for a good while now and has been sleeping in his car it smells like sweat when you fall asleep with your shirt on under too many blankets, we both just looked like a good old fashioned pair of junkies in a car. Jon and I used to shoot heavy together

   The ride begins, his shit so of course he went first I watched every second as intently as I could without being weird, but it was. He jams, and it's finally my turn, I cook up my dope and at the last second ""hey man you wanna throw in a milligram of Xanex on that?"" I've never shot dope and benzos at the same time but I've heard it put you in hard nodsville, so I cook up my my four bags, throw in some extra water and add my xanex. I never tie off because my veins are fucking beautiful for dope and I jam myself. Feelsgoodman.jpg loved it, we chill on our diesel for a bit and get a soda from mcdonalds, I didn't know until later that this happened and I'm not mad or surprised it happened it;s just because people care and are tired of me shooting my life away. So later I finally make it home but i'm still on hard nods
""Miguel
me-""No of course not
""Well Miguel
  We go on for a bit but I was caught, I cried apologized and started packing my things, everyone came over unplanned that night so everyone saw what happened and everyone knows I relapsed. This lead to no one wanting me in their home and I spent the night outside wishing I never knew what heroin was like, I didn't get high, I lost everything I lost my wife, my child, my home, my self worth, If i agreed to be babysat and never leave the house alone I could stay here. they also wanted me to go to detox and start going to NA meetings, I've failed my goal and now all I can do is everything I can to make things right again. Today my only real job is not to get high and it's full time and hard as fuck. That's where it is for now my friends

1349564766.0,1129zo,From chipping for 6 years to shooting up for a month straight... (long story long),halfwayjux,33,5,36,"So I started doing opiates at 15, pill or powder. Although pills were fucking skittles, bi-weekly

After a great number of months I thought it was possible to chip as I had before, until last summer when I first shot dope and sniffed it before that a few days a week, enough that I had to feel like a schmuck taking piggybanks to the closest coinstar that I hadn't cashed out already. Spending money that I shouldn't have, and so it goes. So I stopped...

And then, only heroin is my downfall, well and maybe really good hard while on it, but that's not even that bad. So I did the pills on occasion and got away with it.

Beginning of Summer was the honeymoon. I got bags every now and then, balls were itching and I had no problem scratching them violently in public, in front of who gives a flying fuck. Nod, nod, nod. Don't come home, sleep wherever, it's not REM sleep anyway. Do it a few days in a row and get those false visions of exhaustion...

Silk Road FUCKED it up. One of my best friends made an account and soon began receiving quarter, and only smoking or snorting this gorgeous shit that had to have been skimped off bricks in Afghanistan or some shit, I don't know how else it would've been available. And so began my decline into addiction, low to moderate by my standards. Because it started costing too much for skimped street bags that we ended up settling for, I started to shoot it up. And after the second, third, fourth and fifth shot, didn't get sick. Didn't ever get sick for six years.

Since the beginning of September, anyway, it was a few bags over a day, and it led up to sometimes booting shit buns in a night, smoking hard on top. No money for crack after that, since only heroin could consume me as it did. Better than sex? Pfff. Sex is for idiots who don't know what ""orgasmic"" really feels like. I started loving the bathrooms of White Castle who didn't even care if I bought anything to use them and doing it there every day, sometimes a few a day.

Two thirds into the month-long binge I started to feel that it wasn't fun anymore. I anxiously waited for my dealers who came soon enough, and since I'm already on probation for a couple more years, hopefully only one more, that it'd be even worse. So I decided I had to stop, after ripping great friends off and encouraging them to cop saying that I was getting ten bucks off, ha ha! More like charging you enough so that my bundle or so became free. Scumbag? Oh yeah! Like I gave a shit then. Then there was no more money that wasn't mine to spend anyway on it, and my insulin syringes were dull after the unknown number of bruises and sometimes I found to my horror that that bruise on my forearm WAS NOT FUCKING COOL and WAAAY too fucking big for normalcy. Okay, tomorrow will be it. For a week or so...

Run out of funds and so I get a few subs spotted from the friend I ripped off, just content until I started not being able to get comfortable and aching, cold, hot, both at the same time! Online it said to give it 12-24 until dosing on subs. Well, I only did after 36 hours, and only because I had restless leg and trouble sleeping. One milligram worked. After that, even though I shot decent to good dope for a month straight, but I'm still wondering why they were so minute? The urge to cop was only there the first sober day.

I know I can't responsibly use opiates anymore, because I soon became addicted to the needle. Oh, they didn't lie. I used to dread shots, and now I can't wait for the next one. Drug dealers became my best friends and public bathrooms my favorite place to be. Real friends told me to chill and hit them up when I wasn't being rude - was I? Who cared?

My only regret is ripping off those who didn't deserve it, in less than five minutes of wait. Well, now, as opposed to before, I actually want to stop doing it all, bad drugs, weed, except acid

In closing, who would want to do anything productive anyway right? So I apologize for any scrambled thoughts or typos, and I know I got lucky, and I don't need to test it anymore. I've done enough, and only have 4-ACO-DMT, 2-CI and LSD to recommend to those who wouldn't take advantage or abuse them.

By god though, writing, music and other arts, the endless conquest for all possible retained knowledge and a never-ending progression. Maybe some day I'll be back, but you best believe it'd be Silk Road quality to start. By the way, that site is the future of the drug market and my friend is making enough off of it to take away more of his soul as a result. Our friends died from this, and well, it might as well be they who ran in the same circle.

Me and my 2 friends were about 18, an Ice Cream truck, and fully loaded up fridge with Ice Cream and a bad ass jingle that blared over the intercom was all sitting 10 years away from us in a garage. The kids house that we were hanging out at, who's name is ""Pancho"" for this story, his parent inherited the truck and used it on the weekends around the neighborhood to make the kiddy's happy. At first Puncho was saying ""Hell no...fuck that shit...my Dad will kill me...blah blah blah"" He also said ""I don't even know where the keys are."" So I said, lets just go in, see whats in it an look around.

Once we got into the truck, the keys, sitting right in the fucking ignition! Score. So as Pancho goes into his house to grab more smokes, me and Marky decide we are doing this shit, its hot as fuck out and we can slang the shit out of some Rocket Pop's. Pancho comes back out and me and Mark outline the plan for him. It was currently 10:00AM, by the time we get all the ice cream out of the freezers in the garage, gas up and get on 95 it would be around 11AM. We lived north of Baltimore, but we were going to the west side so It was going to take a little longer

I'm guessing by this time Pancho is feeling the middle to late stage or withdraw

So we hit the road, im not sure of the roads or neighborhood but it was rows and rows of houses. We crank up LJ and start to hit the strip slow....

SUCCESS!!! Kids start running out from there house 3 or 4 at a time, to get some Ma fuckin Herion.... So we sell 23 ice cream pops, witch equates to about 35 dollars. That's barely enough to get one of us well. We need at least $60 each to makes this trip worth while and then some gas money to put back in the truck, so at least like, $200.00. Fuck it was getting to look like this was a waist of time and resources...UNTIL my partner in crime Markey saves the day with an Ingenious Junky Idea.

When the kids on the bikes pulled up they all, atleast 15 to 20 bikes piled up last time. Markey's idea was for two of us to keep the little fuckers busy infront of the truck while the other guy opend the back door and throw all the bikes in a drives off! Holy shit, that was a crazy ass idea, but its only getting later so why the fuck not. We go over about 10 blocks to hopefully get all new kids, turn on YEA! OKKKKKKKKKKKK and it starts to look like ground hogs day. Me and Pancho are all fucking with the kids infront of the truck and Marky was humping bikes up into the back of the truck. Mind you these kids are ages 5 to 13 and there is not an adult in sight.... Makes sense. Soon as Marky says go, I jump into the drivers seat, Pancho slams shut the side door, I was really beginning to think that they could push the truck over

So there we are in the west side of Baltimore with I think 17 bikes in the back of our frekin' ICE CREAM TRUCK?!?!??!! Now it was time to unload them, Marky had a great Idea. He was pretty close, like he shot this shit with one of the D-boys on the west side, and he knows that they buy there toughts and look outs bikes. His idea was to run over to his corner, and ask if he wants to do a trade. Long story short, we take the bikes over to the East Side, Rose St. to be exact, you can sort it but the white fluffy quinine mixed with the raw is really really nasty on the way down.

So there it is

Until today.

To preface, or split a 30. Every once in a while, if I've been feeling physical withdrawal symptoms, like today, I'll try to stretch a 20 out to taper a bit before I discontinue use for awhile. The most I've injected all at once in recent memory was .3g,  and while I was very, very high

So I've been doing more h than usual in the past week or so, and cooked up some tar that cooked up very dirtily, with a large amount of dark brown, particulate matter. I pulled about 25 units into my point, and injected it.

I woke up in an ambulance. I could see when they were about to run the narcan into me. This is where I'm happy my physical addiction is pretty mild, but so happy when I came out of the high. I immediately started crying my eyes out. My kid's mom came to see me in the hospital. It was sweet of her, more than I deserved. My best friend came to pick me up. He didn't really know how to handle it, didn't really know what to do when his best friend of 20 years wouldn't stop crying. But he was there, and that counts.

I had one specific couple that at least once a year would book a seven day or 14 day vacation, and by the time they hit the home airport, they were so dope sick, they had to have people meet them at the airport with a fix. Of course this never worked our with the timing they wanted &amp; they always had problems trying not to puke going through customs or whatever . Sometimes they would try and score wherever they were , which always ended with them being ripped off, and usually ended with them being assaulted as well. The woman was horribly unpleasant when she was dope sick .

I particularly used to sell a lot of cruises, you're going to find the police there searching everybody, and your going to end up in a Jamaican jail unti, someone comes up with enough money to get you out"".  The dealers sell you a bag, give the high sign to the police, who get you on your eay back in, and will give the remainder of the drugs back to the dealer in exchange for burning you.

And it didn't matter, because the cruisline usually has to give them a few cabins to search before they clear the ship, and if they think you're possessing , they'll give them your cabin. 

Now that it's post 911, and I get pulled aside, I have the documentation to prove they are required meds. I once had TSA try and tell me it was dangerous material, and I had to check it , which I refused to do, and had to get a supervisor, who actually called the fucking FBI before I was allowed to board with it


What I have had luck with though is going to pharmacies on islands in the Caribbean like Cozumel Mexico and scoring Soma, some decent pain killers, valium. Recently ships have started to look at the pill bottles you bring back with you from islands, but there are ways to get around that.

Junkies are obsessed with opiates like I am. That's a given. Sharing an addiction with someone can be the ultimate in bonding experiences. It's incredibly intimate and quickly builds trust, your relationship can survive almost anything. 
 On top of that though

 I don't worry so much about being used for one thing. If they didn't want you around for your company, it still happens and it's awesome. They last indefinitely and since they can't get themselves off, they are solely focused on my pleasure. I certainly don't plan on dating a non-user anytime soon.

2. There is some rather potent #4 going around the South/South West areas of the country (USA) right now.  It is cut with fentanyl and people are overdosing with what they consider their normal dose.  Fentanyl is 100X stronger than morphine and it will kill you without blinking an eye.

It seems like every person I know that is dealing with opiates is the most unreliable

I've got three main hookups for Roxi 30s, the other two are seriously selfish assholes. The girl gets to me the most.. She always says she'll be able to get me something and hours will go by with no response or update. Most of the time I'll never be able to get anything from her. Recently she's gotten into banging dillys and I believe she just spends all of her money on that now. She used to go get some blues every day and I'd front her the money and get my stuff about 3 hours later (after she swore it would only take an hour, every time.. I just got used to that.) I know, I know.. Never give money without product, but she never let me down.

The other guy used to be stocked up all the time

I just came into a good supply of 'em, and to be there within 15 minutes.

FUCK THAT I'M DONE BEING THE NICE GUY

Bitch, but after all the bullshit they've put me through (especially the girl) I'm just not being nice anymore. This shit is ridiculous. I know exactly how it feels to be hurting and have people stringing you along but it's just not worth it to even get rid of mine anymore to make the extra $7.

I almost don't even want to sell fucking any to them. I haven't been able to get any for about two weeks now because of these assholes. Why should I sell mine for $5 less than they will sell them to me? And then run out and be hurting and just have to buy them back? And at a $5 premium at that!!??! We used to have a great system where we all helped each other out when the others couldn't find any. I guess the buddy system has died while the addiction has grown.

1367608346.0,1dmwph,A story of an addict trying to study for finals in college.,Kitayets,33,5,28,"Sitting in my room, I knew I was going to fail my classes and time was running out. I wasn't going to go without a fight. No matter how hard I tried I just couldn't focus on my textbook. I knew that if I had some medicine in me I would be able to get some work done. I put all of my energy into finding some, I got a phone call and knew relief was coming shortly. It was about time because it felt like a million scarabs were crawling under my skin

I was too sick to get out of my bed so I had my medicine delivered straight to my room. I crawled out of bed and barely made it to the door. There it was, a pill stronger than anyone and everyone. The mere thought of what was about to happen put some life back into my legs. I carefully stood up and frantically searched for the first piece of foil I could find and a tooter. I was about to be back in my world, the world I loved and was so comfortable in, the world that was quickly crumbling right before my eyes. But at that moment I didn't care. If my world was going down I was going down with it. I took a flame to the perfectly straightened foil and my eyes zoned in on the beautiful pill, sliding down the foil like a teardrop rolling down a cheek. This was my ritual and I loved it as much as getting high itself. I inhaled the dense, blissful smoke of the first hit into my tired lungs and immediately felt as if a thousand pounds were lifted off of my shoulders. Suddenly everything in the world was right again. The pain was gone. Things weren't as bad as they seemed. All my problems seemed to fade under a cover of that thick smoke. ""This is the life"" I thought to myself. With every hit I felt like a part of me was coming back, until I was whole again. Life felt so simple, but so what

I looked down at the foil and all I saw was a black spot. I tried to scrape one last hit but didn't get much. I finally felt decent enough to study, all I wanted to do was enjoy my high. My mind was already on getting my next fix, so it's not like I could study even if I wanted to. I felt like such a dick because I told myself I was going to study after I got high, but I didn't care, I was too busy feeling good. I was so overwhelmed and torn that I broke down in tears. I didn't want this anymore, but I didn't know how to get out of it. I put myself in this trap, and I didn't even realize it. No one was answering my phone calls. My meds were wearing off and I knew it would be a long, and sad night ahead. I wrapped myself in my blankets, living for the short and ever fleeting moments of relief that my pills would bring me.

In the past such an acquisition usually took hours, no, this time it took something like 12 minutes and a mile drive from my home in what some might consider the ""ghetto"" to the local shopping center just the next town over. And now, back at home, I took a moment to admire the tiny packets now resting atop my dresser.


Warm with anticipation, The meager pile exhumed from the packet was quickly shaped with an equally decrepit debit card into a neat line, about an inch in length. A straw cut into a third was retrieved from my sock drawer, placed in one nostril as the opposite hands index finger effectively plugged the other. From there it was as simple as a deep breath before taking a step back and lowering myself to the refuge of my bed.


Within several quick moments the effects began to take hold, as if my veins now carried along them a very sincere and tingle inducing sense of security.

the good fight on this sub. Your stories have entertained
and gave me perspective
for that I thank you all. Here's a true story that happened to me yesterday.

Okay with that out of the way I would like you to take a journey with me.
Now I've had my times with our DOC and for the most part I've had it under 
control
months. How have I done this you ask? Simple suboxone. But this isn't a story 
of kicking this is a story of some pretty damn good luck! Unfortunately I have 
not been able to afford my sub script for the past week
rapidly leaving my system during days 6-7 without anything I was feeling terrible
absolutely like shit. I couldn't sleep at all last night knowing that Tuesday I would
be getting paid. So Tuesday morning finally comes after hours in limbo rolling 
around sweating. I get ready as best my sorry ass could
the classic Weekend At Bernie's. I come to the decide to treat myself to a high
before I go back on my sub regiment (of course!). I call my dude and everything
is a go
shaking
the withdrawal key (yes I see the irony in that button as well) instead of cash the 
dreaded insufficient funds pop up. ""No!"" I think to myself
I am completely defeated, ruined, fucked. Damn MLK day pushed 
my direct deposit back a day. I spent the next couple of hours cursing myself in bed. 
Oh and one thing I forget to tell you good people is that I had traffic court at 4 pm
just another horrible event to add to the day's list.

Now with our hero in this story
the day as a full bust I get ready for court. I notice that I am missing a paper that I
needed for the courts. So I search my car where I thought I put it. Now this is where 
my day turns around. In the pouch behind my driver seat I pull out a piece of paper 
thinking it's that paid ticket I needed. It wasn't bropiates
out I had stashed a pay check behind there from August (I was working 3 jobs at the time).
This paycheck is for an actually good amount of money to. Instantly I am so happy
""Victory is in the air!"" I scream as I head to the bank to cash it. Once cashed I head to my 
dude and I tell him I would like 15 bags of the finest ECP
says he's busy (oh no!) but sends one of his little runners to meet me. The process takes 
about 15 minutes to meet with the runner. I hand him the money as he throws the goods 
in my car and takes off. For some reason I feel something was off
to inspect the product I see the runner actually gave me 25 bags! 10 freaking bags over! I'm 
not one to try and get over on my connect for a few bags so I gave him a call (I didn't even 
have the runner's number) and tell him that he had given me extra
dude keep it
is fire! I did 2 bags and it floored me
or two of nods ahead of me before I go back to my regiment
indeed! Oh and court got dismissed so it turned into a great day all in all. Thanks for listening bros
I know it was a little on the long side but I tend to get long winded when I am fucked up. So here's 
my first post into our small but awesome community. Happy nods to all!

Use a dremel to grind down the pill into a powder (really the only possible way you can do it).

Add about 100units of dry acetone (99% or better

Stir vigorously for about 10 mins

Remove and continue to stir the mixture.

Continue these last two until you see most of the pill break down and dissolve into solution.

Filter the solution through filter paper (or coffee filters). Save the product IN the filter

If done correctly, and left the oxymorphone (and talc, and a few other binders) intact.

Let the powder from the filter dry out a bit

The reason this works, while oxymorphone is not. This is also why you cannot use wet acetone, as the Oxymorphone will just go into solution with the other shit as it is soluble in water.

This might work without having to first grind down the pill,False,,t5_2r0y3,False,,,t3_t54b2

For me

It ain't the WDs, the limp-dick lack of interest in the opposite sex (or whatever floats your boat on a sunny day), the daily rollercoaster of rage, the social alienation, or the sheer, visceral, madness of it all...

It's easily, literally, Full of Shit. 

Now I know no one wants to talk about pooping. Poopy smells, and having a swollen stomach full of poop. And the full implications thereof.

To me

I remember backpacking through Cambodia, who resided riverside. A tentative transaction, first, led to some good quality opium dragon-tail chasin. Next up, was the holy grail: he delivered what looked to be a solid gram of straight out the Opium Triangle, lovely golden brown heroin. 

Days it must have been .. me and my girl spent at that Fairyland of a hotel, and it was time to pack our bags and move on,  we were in a post-heroin-haze, to say the least ... laid out on the bed, moving  little. 6AM: ""KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK."" It's douchebag Karl knocking on our door, ""Time to go temple trekking guys!"" he said in his most enthusiastic, bright eyed bushy tail

 Sittin on that tuk-tuk (half a motorcycle with a carriage attached to it), got to the Golden Gekko hotel in Siam Reep, where most of the temple trekking would take place out of, and I took the biggest shit of my life. Poor Cambodian plumbing had NO fucking chance, a 6'3 shitter backed up for 3 days high on heroin and happiness... instant toilet clogger. Dropped the lid on that sucker and walked out, that's someone elses problem. Right.

Wrong. I alerted the Cambo staff

Honestly

Thoughts? Shitty stories to share? 

p.S - DOn't even get me started on toilet paper. The rest of the world uses bidets/bum guns to wash their asses. First thing I did when I came back to the states was install a bum gun. Highly recommended.

DEA has decided I am not in ""enough"" pain.

Today my wife and I visited 17 different local pharmacies

Three back surgeries so far, and have filled these exact prescriptions during that time at the exact same Walgreens and CVS stores. I know and am friendly with the staff. My wife carries a complete copy of my medical records. Documenting every surgery, every needle that's been driven into my spine, every procedure. Today, every single pharmacy was united in their message: Your records no longer matter. The three inch thick pile of records proving I am in severe pain ""no longer counts."" Nor could they tell me what WOULD count, what WOULD make a difference. Because, you see

Today my pharmacist told me that they would probably never carry any schedule 2 medications again. At Walgreens. At ALL locations. Forever. Just as frightening, we will no longer fill your prescription."" No explanation, no method to appeal, nothing more to be done or said. Not even a vague idea provided about how to ""meet"" these nonexistent requirements.

I called Humana

DEA has vilified a legitimate and useful medication that has improved my life and the lives of countless others. It is reprehensible

I use 150 fifteen mg pills per month. Five per day. DEA regularly trumpets headlines like ""We shut down a pharmacy that distributed nearly 200,000 people, and in a city the size of the Tampa Bay Area, these numbers seem perfectly reasonable.

I am keenly aware of the illicit trade as well, left behind in a DEA witch hunt that will only hurt all of us. And seems to have no safety net for those in true need.

When the day comes that I run out of my current medication, she knows the great efforts I have undergone to get well. Then, I will at least have the pain relief I need. Of course, it will cost taxpayers tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and eventually millions of dollars. Because of medicine that is really worth a couple dozen dollars, at most.

Somehow I doubt this outcome is what anyone envisioned, but vital protest. Which also assures us that we will have the pain relief we require.

Please work on a solution. Please help me. Please help us. I have all my records. I am willing and ready to meet with you, but the clock is not only ticking, it is a roaring inferno.

Well
  
Now for some background: This lady, animal waste, mold, body odor, and cigarette smoke.  
  
At some point in the last two months she started sharing this house with a guy only known as ""Pill Bill"". Obviously
  
Okay, and me were waiting for the pill guy to come as 1:30 rolls around. At this point Sandy had been outside talking to her landlord, paying rent, when Pill Bill's mom rolls up to get his stuff. He was apparently suppose to have it ready to just go because she knew he would be going to jail at any moment.  
  
The mom and Sandy talk outside for a bit and Sandy says she has to go talk to this guy (the pill guy) and tell him she can't go with him (lie). Sandy hobbles over
  
We waited a second and then opened the door and the women told us her story and we haphazardly looked around for a suitcase on wheels
  
At this point the poor woman, just get her son's.  
  
Well
  
I've known Sandy for a few years and she loves me to death so as the older guy went and started looking for the bag I went to Sandy to convince her that this lady DID NOT want to take ANYTHING that was not her son's property. She just wanted to get his clothes and other belongings and leave and with Sandy's cooperation we could do it in no time.  
  
We quickly rifled through all the piles of clothes and junk to find Pill Bill's stuff and start throwing it in plastic bags.  
  
I have never seen a human being so grateful in person in my entire fucking life. Even typing it now brings back those emotions and makes me a little teary because I could *feel* all the hurt and anguish and sadness as she thanked us profusely for helping her.  
  
We eventually got everything sorted and put in the woman's car and she drove away... I just hope someday she won't have to do things like this ever again. She was such a nice lady because she completely knew why we were all in that house and what went on,False,,t5_2r0y3,1365257309.0,,,t3_1bsj0p

Anyhow

I hear the song, ""I want something else"" kept repeating, and it triggered something in my brain. I wanted something else other than dope and drugs to make me happy. I then decided to not buy a lot of bitcoins and use drugs, for now at-least.

Thanks for listening

So anyway here i am back in rehab, that isn't good enough. ok, so backup plan, i let my team know i need to get on sub maintenance. BANG shot down again. because of the eviction notice, my housing is not stable enough to be in their maintenance program. So I'm pretty pissed at this point, i bring up another issue, my medication. i put it to them like this my medications are not helping me, and if i leave here without an effective medication regimen then my chances of staying clean are very slim. they say i may be able to talk to a psyche dr in 2 weeks. quick math, at some point i buy a amtrak ticket. and he leaves and heads back to the shelter he was staying at. the day after he leaves i get a call from him, they are doing a documentary on veterans dealing with addiction and are willing to pay just to talk. i kinda don't believe him so i tell him ill give him a call when i get home. 2 hours later he calls

the day comes when its time to get on the train. I'm well stocked with enough oxymorphone to last 5 days and 4 bundles of dope. of course i run out of pills in a day and a half. so i go on an adventure to the westside during a layover in chicago. it works out and i have enough to get to cali comfortably. everything goes pretty good, how I'm feeling etc. when we get to cali I'm out of dope withdrawals start kicking in. hbo dude films it. he has a rented car at the hotel we are at. i beg him to take me down to skid row to find something. he tells me to stick to the plan and not to make any contacts out there. he's a good dude tries to distract me and promises to get me to the va first thing in the AM. the next morning i head over to the va hospital and am admitted.


I detox at the VA and tbe wds are not bad at all compared to past experiences. time comes to figure out where to go from her. apparently they don't have an inpatient VA dehab out here. they refer me to a rehab ran by salvation army, give it a try, knowing that beggars cannot be choosers i head over to the program. my first night i spend in the shelter half. the facility has a shelter and a rehab unbeknownest to me. so day 2 i start going to groups. not too bad although i didn't sleep much my first night. I was told hygeine items were provided, they weren't. i didn't. even have a towel. luckily i stole sheets and a blanket from someone's bed. it was very unorganized and no one told me the rules or anything. day 3 i had a drs appt so when i heard the intercom call for anyone going to the va to be outside at 7am i headed outside and rode the bus the 2 houRs to the va. my appt was a simple mental health checkin after leaving the detox. The social worker whom i was speaking with was worried as i apparently looked like i was losing it. so he had me talk to a psyche who wanted to give me klonipin but upon investigation it wasn't allowed at the rehab so he prescribed a high dose gabapentin and penciled me in for the next day. i headed to the pharmacy and picked em up and went to wait for the bus. i get back and hit the last few groups. day 4 again didn't sleep much and the gabapentin doesnt seem to help. around 645 i head out to wait on the bus, but am called back in. i go see what's up. i get bitched at for not seeing some lady to do an intake. no one told me anything about this so she tells me we'll do it now i tell her i gotta take the bus. she tells me i can take a city bus, i ask her for bus tokens, they don't have any so angerily she tells me to go. fast forward to day 5 i again have an appointment this secretary lady again bitches at me, they talk to the program director and he says to come back. this is the first communication i see between the program and the VA even though i was assured that they talk to the va ans will make sure i make all appts. whatever. so i head back that evening. i guess fridays are when they party cuz i notive someone shooting up in a stall, apparently you are not allowed to hold your own meds. i am booted from the program bc i had my scripts in my locker. 

I go to the VA with my bags and they send me to another program which promptly boots me for having dirty urine (you are supposed to detox before going to their program.) at this point I'm fed up. fuck it

But we go through the same dealer. So I picked up from the dealer today and lo and behold, because in addition to the heroin &amp; methadone, my buddy has a problem with benzodiazepines. He must be going through benzo withdrawal. Shucks.

Normally, he's not my friend anymore. Now, he's a junkie. I've been burned too many times by this lying piece of shit. He thinks he's got everyone fooled, but the only fool is him.

Sorry to post this if it's like off-topic or not the right thing to say, and is just barely getting by on her own, so in the rare case that she _did_ get (god forbid) HIV, it's a fucking terrible situation.

I tried to reassure her that the odds are pretty damn low of getting HIV or Hep-C even assuming whoever used it _had_ that

I'm a junky, etc. Grew up in Brooklyn. Not the worst part of town, but really far from ""good"". Most of my friends I grew up with are the same as me. Career drug addicts and criminals. Product of my environment? Maybe. I like to take responsibility for my actions, so I guess all that is my choice. I started shooting dope four years ago, but out of the last four years, I was able to.get 17 months clean with the help of a program.

So

I relapsed last year. I always thought, the shame and personal guilt would kill me. Heh, nothing like that happened. I just kept banging dope. At home, at work, everywhere. I'm extremely functional. Most of my friends didn't even know I relapsed. I kept up appearances, did great at work. Just never had any money, because I had a two bundle a day habit. So since February of last year, shooting massive amounts of heroin, heroin is a way of life. Everything else is just a distraction. Dunno. Those 17 months of sobriety didn't really do much for me... And that's the longest time I had been clean in more than a decade. Sure, and tries to work on it. I decided to get sober because at the time

So, I knew I had to get clean and step up my game at work so I could have my own place. Went to detox, got clean for a week, started using again. Rinse and repeat twice. Then I said fuckit. I knew I had to feel the pain, went to upstate new York and kicked my habit (up to  30 bags daily by now) cold turkey. Man, that was rough... Laying there, 90+ hours awake, I broke. Started using again. By this time, and decided to throw all that away. On the other hand

At the end of January, get away from my dealers and ""friends"" in Brooklyn. Wound up running out in Indianapolis. Got sick, and all my well laid plans went out the window. Tried hard to score in town, but I swear to god, that place is square as shit. Wound up getting a gram and a half of tar from SR. Being used to reeally high quality Ny dope, it lasted me two days. I was also burning through money ridiculously quick. I never learned how to budget. To me, money is nothing. All those years of using, cause that's all I would have after supporting my habit. So.. it was cold as shit in Indianapolis, and total shit

So, so I found ANOTHER job, within the same week, right in the French Quarter. What recession? Functional, I told ya ;) 

I'm gonna be alright. Surviving is what I do. The problem is, I got this motherfucker in the bag, but the problem is... I dunno if I'll be happy doing that. I don't really wanna stop. Bad case of asshole disease, the ol' I want to have my cake and eat the motherfucker too. Anyone else ever been in this situation? Maybe its just time to grow up, bit dammit, I don't wanna :)

If you're still reading this, but it shouldn't be too bad. 3-5 days of hell, but I'm a big boy, and big boys don't cry right? Also, I'm totally aware that I sounded like a total asshole jerkoff in some places, but I'm not sorry! Honesty is the best policy.

1301191837.0,gc9t2,My Kratom advice for those going through withdrawals,DevoretOpiate,27,4,22,"Firstly

There are various types of Kratom, or can be more relaxing with decent euphoria. 

The vast majority of people agree that the stimulating kinds of Kratom (i.e Thai, much LESS desirable for treating withdrawals and can in fact actually be problematic. Conversely, the more relaxing/euphoric types of Kratom (i.e Bali, Malaysian, Sumatran) are much more effective in treating withdrawal symptoms and feel much more like an actual opiate than the stimulating types. 

Personally, euphoric and cheap price wise. Green Malaysian is also a great choice. 

Anyways

As a last note

**TL;DR**- If you're going through withdrawals or want a more relaxing/euphoric experience from Kratom it's likely you'll be much better off with strains like Bali

**edit:** ""Toss and Wash"" is the best way to take Kratom and it simply means put some Kratom in your mouth and swallow with water or juice. Best thing to do is put the Kratom under your tongue initially and then put some liquid in your mouth and try to swallow all the Kratom at once in one gulp. There is an art to doing this

**edit:** Can't believe I forgot to mention this... always try to use Kratom on a COMPLETELY empty stomach (literally nothing in your stomach whatsoever) as it's most effective this way! If you feel nauseous after dosing on an empty stomach

**edit:** If you need to know some good online kratom sellers

**edit:** I guess I'll post a couple vendors publicly afterall... **KTBotanicals.com** is truly one of the best sites around (search for ""Kratom"" in their search bar). They have excellent regular green-veined Bali as well as a large variety of other strains and everything is guaranteed high quality. Their extracts are 100% legit as well, **loveleafgarden.com** which is unfortunately closed temporarily has excellent Kratom (ESPECIALLY their Super-fine Bali and Super Green Malaysian imo). Loveleafgarden has a few links to other sites to use that they can personally vouch for until they get back open and I'd imagine they are good quality being that loveleafgarden is most excellent. IMO, just keep an eye out for when they re-open and use ktbotanicals.com now :)",,False,,t5_2r0y3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/opiates/comments/gc9t2/my_kratom_advice_for_those_going_through/

When I got sober I got some of my friends and all of my family back.  One of my closest friends that I have been friends with since the sixth grade blew me off the other day.

Because as an addict I am miserable

I would like to think that I could be a chipper, and actually put in some work towards being the person I want to be.  I am very far from the person I want to be.  I want to be someone that people enjoy spending time with again.  I have not been that person since I started using years ago.  I am finally ready.

I fell in love with the drug. I used any opiates I could get my hands on but it was a rare occurence. For about a month and a half it dried up and I didn't get to snort any pills the whole time. Finally gave in to seeing what heroin was all about. At first it was a once in a while thing, to see what I had missed that day. But something was different. Something was off. This wasn't just being tired. My whole body felt drained. By 10PM I was in withdrawal for the first time. Cold sweats

My body ached. I hadn't eaten in 48 hours. My stomach felt full, I gave in and cut off a small chunk of my rock of #4. I drew up some water and got ready to mix it into the spoon. But at the last second, I changed my mind. I knew that the uncomfortable feeling I was experiencing was nothing compared to the fullblown withdrawals of people who have been using for years. I decided to give my body a break and went to bed.

That was last night. I woke up feeling tired and having no energy. I still hadn't eaten more than a few bites of cereal. I finally mustered up enough energy to get a shot ready

First, self-destructive run. We all have more in common than we otherwise would. Sadly, it’s time for me to get the fucking move on. I’ve been encapsulated by the opiate womb coma for four years. I owe it to my ~~family~~  myself to see the rest of this decade of my life through with conviction and a strive toward some, any form of clarity and purpose. I will not forget from where I came or the people I befriended along the way. I’ve met a great number of people who I hold in high regard. This is not a dismissal on The Life, this is merely my independent exit from it. I wish you all safety and fruitful pursuits.

My quit date was Nov. 27, creditors’ worst nightmare, and all around self-absorbed, righteous dickhead.

It all came to a head over thanksgiving break, Maryland, Delaware, NJPike, NYC and Connecticut. If you play your cards right and take minimal stops it can be done in 11 hours. This time around I didn’t hit the road until 1p.m because I wanted to make sure I was stocked: Gram and a half of dope and all the consumables, 250mls of liquid Xanax (.5mgs per drop), THC Jolly Ranchers and a carton of cigarettes. Hit the road running.  I am not proud of this. 

The ride went as usual, I ended up pulling over and getting a hotel in Fredricksburg, Va just shy of DC. Figured I’d throw it on the company card and enjoy myself. Countless shots and drops later, dinner at Hooters next to the hotel where I was a complete zombie I almost passed out. Back in the room was a little video chat with some other bropiates and sleep.  Wakeup call for 9a.m, drop drop, shot, shower, check-out

I blew through DC by the Pentagon, sure I can take a little detour to the city. Took the 2 hour detour to pick him up, we go and score, fix on top of all I had been doing that day. Shit I’ve got a headache and fever. Drive him home, dose with a couple drops of the Xanax and I’m on my merry way again. By the time I cleared the city and airport the headache had set in. Had I caught cotton fever for the second time in two weeks? Pull off highway before hitting the NJ turnpike, check into a hotel with my own money this time, the bean counters knew I had made one night stop, especially so far off course.

In the hotel room I hooked up the laptop, showed off my newly acquired dope on top of everything else that was beginning to look quite spent and fix. Did a shot to subside the shivering at this point. Yep, pretty sure it’s the fever. I was able to sleep through it, however, magic.

10 a.m wakeup call, drop, shot, shower, candy, check-out, and I was back on the open road. Xanax was having a weird effect on me. I had never really fucked with the awful stuff in the past, voice began to have a reverberation even I in my state could hear. Blew through NJ Turnpike with the easy pass mounted on my dash

Finally in Ct, Hartford; can finally re-up on cheap bundles and white there, going out tonight boozing, hitting on girls fucked out of our minds, going to be a good night.

Crash.

Didn’t even make it through Greenwich, I’m going nuts making sure their infant in the back seat is OK.
Cops show up. Get the grill down by them, cottons, needles, two different kinds of dope, coke, Xanax dropper into one of the many bags in my backseat in an incredibly calm manner. Cover up my forearms that are an absolute travesty of track marks. Kind of blank out after that, I was sitting in the driver seat

 Cop comes back to the window, son?” Fuck, must have seen my DUI from when I was 18. “Nope, officer.” Straight  stare back at him, turn intensity up to a 7. Damn, it always amazed me how unnoticeable to non-users opiate user are. Tow truck pulls up in back, FUCK. 

Now at this point you may be thinking, if the cop searched your car you were looking at felony possession, if he blood tested or even sobriety tested you it would be instant DUI. Yeah, you would think. Get picked up from a friend at the Stamford train station, luggage and drugs in tow. Wallet lost in the mix-up. Home by 10pm, everyone is asleep thankfully. Safe.

The next couple of days were spent working, 150$ balls of that white girl, good to be home. One of those days my go-to wasn’t picking up and I was completely out. Brute force through work with a couple bags. Out at 3. Drive down to the hood, usual corners are empty, what the FUCK. Alright, time to be industrious. Park the car, hit the block. The only white dude in a sea of Hispanics and blacks, everyone’s a comedian. End up talking to some Puerto Rican in Spanish, bang bang, linoleum floored entryway. A tirade of questions in Spanish

….
Cold turkey. Haven’t taken a break, polish guy with slim fitting clothes from what looked like Express and a ponytail pulling his hair and face into a tight squint. “I hear someone’s been a naughty boy.” I look up from the hospital bed with my mother and sister at my side. “Can’t argue there, been firing dope into my veins.” He laughs gets on his haunches and begins to break down my options. He somehow convinced my mother, father, sister and even me that I was strong enough to kick at home. “The brain is 100% chemistry. I know hundreds of junkies who have kicked thousands of times. You’ve done it before, you know you can do this.”  Since I had done it before and since I was approaching 24 hours with no outwards signs of withdrawal, probably the Xanax’s long half-life still in my system
As anyone else in the situation I stocked up with the usual over the counter meds in a fleeting attempt at making the next week bearable, Gatorade, Tylenol pm, more lope, Sudafed and a host of melatonin, and hydroxy-tryptaphan.  Not that any of that could touch the internal torment I went through for the next 8 days. I was stuck in a weird form of purgatory, disgustingly tired without a hope in the world of sleeping
10 days into the detox I still hadn’t slept for more than 5 minutes consecutively, which my mind had not experienced since 15 years of age, a strange clearness opened up.
….

TLDR; I'm done guys

I obviously cut the story short when I realized I was over 2000 words

A while back I came across this guide of several methods to potentiate an opiate high. I did not write this myself but it really does work well. I reccomend this thread be stickied.....my bad if this has been posted before...



""Hi BLTC!

What's up. Haven't shown my face in quite some time, and of course, drugs.

So

That was when my opiate use was, I use several times a week, and only to keep my tolerance from rising and to avoid becoming physically dependant do I limit my indulgence.

And, in all it's new, revamped glory:

That said

* T-45) 600mg Tagamet HB(Cimetidine HCl), preferably from concentrate.
* T-35) 30mg DXM HBr, 330mg Naproxen(Aleve).
* T-20) 2 Tums OR 1.5 Tbsp. of Baking SODA. (Obviously this step only applies if you are eating your opes)
* T-0) Parachute\chew\rail\bang your opiate\opioid.
* T+10) Smoke a bowl or two. Not more

In depth explanation:

The Tagamet HB (Cimetidine) is a broad CYP450 inhibitor. This basically means it 'clogs' the enzymes that metabolize opiates\opioids and clear 'em out of the body. Tagamet HB tablets are 200mg each

Quinine is an ingredient in tonic water, CYP2D6. It doesn't 'clog' as many enzymes as Tagamet does, but it STRONGLY 'clogs' CYP2D6, which is the MAIN enzyme for opiates like oxycodone, heroin, hydromorphone, etc. A large glass of straight tonic water is plenty. I prefer the ""Vintage"" brand. You can buy a liter of tonic water at any grocery for like $2.00.

White grapefruit juice contains three ingredients that clog the CYP450 set. However, and although that's almost an 'auxillary' enzyme for alot of opiates, it definitely helps out. Again, it's cheap. Go to any grocery store and you should be able to get a nice big bottle of 100% whitre grapefruit juice from concentrate for like $2.50-$3.50.

An important thing to note for the grapefruit juice is the percentage of juice. A lot of companies make ""White grapefruit juice"" that is basically water, and also, you want to make sure it's 100% white grapefruit juice! A very common business practice for juice companies is to create 'juice cocktails'. These are beverages that are MAINLY cheap filler juices like apple and pear, with the advertised fruit only partially accounting for that '100% juice' the bottle sports so vividly. Look in the ingredients list, and make sure the only juice in there is white grapefruit, preferably from concentrate.

Nutritionally, grapefruit juice from concentrate can contain 25%-40% MORE naringin, bergamottin and dihydroxybergamottin; the three enzyme inhibitors present in white grapefruit.

Now, they last MUCH longer. Also, blood plasma levels of opiates have been shown to vastly higher when the CYP450 set is strongly inhibited; meaning their is a higher peak, and it lasts longer.

It's a win-win situation

On to the other shit. Benadryl(diphenhydramine HCl) and CPM(chlorpheniramine maleate) are both over-the-counter anti-histamines that increase the analgesic and euphoric properties of opiates to some extent. They also help cut down on the ope-itch. In addition

Seeing a pattern here?

DXM (Dextromethorphan HBr, etc.[not that it needed an intro on this board]) has a special effect in this formula. Although it doesn't inhibit the CYP450 set to any appreciable extent, it does contribute to analgesia and euphoria for all major opiates. Also, it has been shown to prevent the build up of tolerance! 30mg of DXM a good half hour or so before dosing will definitely slow any tolerance build up if you use this method every time. And with opiates, that's a VERY big deal.

The Naproxen(Aleve) adds to the analgesia and euphoria. Aleve comes in 220mg tabs

The tums\baking soda is only necessary if you're eating the opiates in question. Basically, but ya know what I mean] which allows more of the opiate to be absorbed into the blood.

It's fine to smoke a little bud, tops. If you have a moster tolerance, titrate accordingly, but if you smoke a few times a week .3 will be perfect.

To further breakdown all this pre-dose potentiation

* T-45) 3 200mg Cimetidine pills
* T-35) 1 Coriciden Cough &amp; Cold Low Blood Pressure
* T-20) 2 extra strength Tums if I'm popping the opes.
* T-0) Rail\pop those shits.
* T+10) *Smokes a bowl*

The Coriciden has both 30mg of DXM and 4 mg of CPM

Also, but in the dosages I listed, there are *NO* perceived changes in the quality of the high. It really does feel like you took more opiate, minus some itching.

Anyway, feel free to post.

And if this is too lengthy, with my all-powerful formula.

...and I'm procrastinating for a paper due tomorrow morning. But that's besides the point. Peace!

N0 W4RN1NG

EDIT: Forgot to mention:

This formula should NOT be used in combination with codeine. Codeine's pleasurable effects are largely dependant on it's metabolization into morphine via CYP450 subsets. This formula basically fucks that shit up the ass. If you're using codeine

Also, so if you're taking opiates with tylenol included (Vicoden, Percoset, Endocet, Tylenol 3, etc) be nice to your liver and don't drink. Liver failure is no picnic, mkay?""

I shot incense at bonaroo back in 2002. My nose was stopped up (I had been snorting OC 80s all day) so I couldn't tell from the smell and it looked like that kind of crumblyish tar, cut to 5-10 mins later and I'm barfing and sweating and my mouth tastes like nag champa. I black out after that and came to is the medical center they had there. While I was laying there with an IV in my arm and my beard filled with barf I started to trip my asshole inside out. The nurse holds up the bag of my ""tar"" and says ""is this what you used?"" and I nodded and she told me it was just incense. The nurse wanted me to go to a hospital but the main dr. guy said I would be ok but to come back if I started feeling bad again. They also gave me naloxone because my gf that gave them the bag of my ""tar"" said it was heroin. So I ended up going into terrible WDs because of the 160mgs of OC I did earlier...while tripping. So since I was feeling like shit I decided to head back to camp and try to relax but on my way back a cop decided to pick me out and fuck with me, probably because I looked like a zombie on account of the vomit now caked into my beard and pupils the size of half dollars. I knew he was going to search me so I quickly ate the remaining 4 hits of acid I had in my pocket so I wouldn't get popped. The cop searched me (I was in a cartoon at this point) and found my dugout with fresh herb in it, I forgot about having the dugout on me but hey, at least it wasn't acid. He wrote some stuff down on a ticket thing and gave it to me. I threw it away and it never came up again, don't even have any warrants. I finally made it back to camp and crawled in my tent and listened to Weird Al and Tom Waits tapes until I felt good enough to pass out. 

**TL;DR** - I injected that Indian poop stick incense thinking it was tar while I was on acid and OC and then got shoved dick first into WDs when a nurse gave me naloxone when someone said I was on heroin and then got searched by a cop while tripping and going through WDs which went better than expected.

He tells me he wants to try it first before he decides how much he wants to give me but that it will probably only be a half a point because he's a greedy fuck.  shoulda settled on a set amount before i went and scored.  what the fuck ever dude...  i'm sick and i don't go to the ghetto to cop for free.

The whole time this guy is talking a big game.  how he will get a bundle every day if he likes it.  blah blah blah.  this g (ecp

So i'm sort of half paying attention to him and half looking at the computer because i don't want to be all annoying and hovering over him waiting for my shit like an anxious little kid.  I didn't see how much he had poured into his spoon and i also was not aware that he had been popping blue footballs and vic10s all morning.  At one point

so this guy is laying on my floor.  one of my friends is flipping his shit, was monitoring his breathing and heart rate.  I was honestly just pissed.  There was a huge dude layed out on my floor, and i didn't get my drugs.  I stay about 2 blocks from a hospital so i had freaking out friend back the car into the yard and the three of us all carried his heavy, completely unconscious ass to the back seat of the car.  He was still breathing and had a stable heartbeat.  He reacted slightly to earlobe pinches and sternum taps.  He was mostly just nodded the fuck out, but that is the beginning of the danger zone.  So we safely get him in the car without bumping his head or squishing his feet.

Y'all are gonna think i'm a dick and i'll probably get downvoted but whatever, easily less than half a g now(he had shared with the other two folks, too.  Just not me.)  and poured about about .15 into my own baggy.  then i grabbed a xanax and the blunt he had stashed in the door handle.  I copped for him, then i carried his fat ass to the car and safely sent him off the emergency room.  I deserved that shit.  I gave the pill bottle to the more level-headed of the two friends and asked her to make sure that's not on him when he goes in(DUH, i wouldn't put it past these asshats...).

Moral of the Story:  Don't pop benzos all day then do a giant shot of dope

A question also arises; to cop for idiots or to not cop for idiots.  On one hand they have lots of money that they can blow on drugs and help support my hustle but on the other hand they aren't too sharp.  The nurse is pretty smart

I got him safely to the hospital but not before i grabbed a little bit of dope and a pill and a blunt off of him as an EMT/finders fee.  He actually just texted me thanking me for getting him to the hospital and asking for a ride when he gets done up there

About mid-afternoon I went to the ER to play-up a fall that never happened on the shoulder I've had three surgeries on for chronic dislocations. I told them I slipped on a patch of ice and felt the humerus shift outwards for a split second and return to position again

I had x-rays taken, and hands me a script for naproxen. I thanked him and asked him if he wouldn't mind writing me a script for something a little stronger as I know that sleeping is going to be hell for the next few nights. He's game.

Much to my lamenting he came back with a second prescription for tramadol as I have a codeine and morphine allergy and he wants to stick to synthetics. Fuck. Think fast

""Tramadol? Is that what Ultracet is?""

""Yes

""Oh

""Well, really and they're both codeine-derivatives.""

""That's what they always gave me after surgery

""Okay

""Thanks

Now I have the script for 15, two mostly en-route and one, 15 minutes out of the way. All closed. Well, fuck me! You put off going over there because you were still pissed off at yourself for being an idiot last night with no benefit, and now you’re over an hour late and you still didn’t get anywhere.

That really made me feel like the asshole I know I can be sometimes and which I try SO HARD to keep anyone else from ever glimpsing. I'm running around to do all this shit, still. She’s better than that. Hell, you don’t even deserve yourself, considering who you were, how you wrecked that, then painfully crawled out of that hole you dug for yourself.

So I spend the evening over there, pre-euphoric and with an inexplicably itchy nose that only serves to berate me for all this effort with its ironic presence.
I put in all that energy, I wouldn't be living with my parents four years after having to move back in with them. I'm definitely better than when I moved out here. Off the junk. Quit FedEx, too. (You have no idea the amount of pharmaceuticals moving through that place.) Clean except for once in a great while when I do something foolish. (Like selling hydromorphone on the side, telling myself I can just play middleman once a month and not touch it.) But I'm still here. Because of tonight. I'm still here.
I can't believe how stupid it all is.

If I don't stop fucking around, and continuing to wallow in the transiently-blissful, apathy of opiates. I have two choices: I can either grow the fuck up or I can continue to slip back down that slope of Teflon and waterslides that I Sisyphus’d for too long before forcefully digging in my nails and painstakingly crawling to the top of that ride with bloody fingers to show for my determined effort to the top.

The view from there is the only one I want

I was in a really bad car reck last year which left me with one ruptured disc and 2 herniated disc. I just had my 3rd major back surgery in a 5 month period. Each time I left the hospital after my surgeries the strongest pain medication my doctor would give me is hydrocodene 10mg 325mg which I was prescribed to take one every 4 hours. I have been on these for at least a year now and have built up a huge tolerance to them. It usually take 7 minimum to even get a decent amount of relief. In-between my 2nd and third surgery I was in a lot of pain and asked if I could be put on anything stronger and all I was prescribed was ultracet and phenergan which did shit besides make me sleepy as hell. Finally I asked him to give me something stronger for when I went home from the hospital after the last surgery. He prescribed me oxycodone (percocet) 10mg 325mg to take once every 6 hours. I feel like even with this I'm still getting screwed because they are a little stronger but with the less frequent dosage
And small amount he prescribed (40) that I might as well just stick to high dosages of hydrocodone. I see people here that get prescribed way stronger pain meeds than what I have right now and I could almost guaranty my pain is at the very least equal to theirs. What's going on here? Am I doing or saying something wrong? Is this normal for doctors to do? I feel like I'm being strung a long here

My little brother would have been turning 21 this Sunday, so no bars for me, but I was the sister who had run away at seventeen. No one told me anything. Not then

He's been dead almost two years now, I dread each day I wake. 

My life hasn't been easy. I was molested by a neighbor when I was four, brother, and I everywhere. My mother recorded all the conversations we had with our dad. I was called into court to testify at their divorce hearings, each one begging me to tell the judge how awful the other was. They were both awful. But how do you say that to a stern-faced judge at ten years old? I started doing meth stolen from my dad at fourteen, sent away to boarding school at fifteen. When I got kicked out of boarding school after junior year- I knew it was go back to live with my drunk mom, or get the fuck out. I got the fuck out. 

I hitchhiked to the west coast, at least if I was miserable it would be as a result of my *own* actions. I looked around my life and I knew that it was what I had made it. I wanted better, I wanted to feel better. So I moved away again, said, I want to be a good person, and surely now life will yield a little joy to me.

And it did, surely now life could not be so cruel as to break me down again. But he was still dying back in our parents house, the little brother I left. The little brother I got hooked on meth, which lead to pills, which lead to heroin, which lead to death. The only one who knew my life, knew what it was *really* like inside that suburban box house that looked like a middle-class dream. The only family I really loved.

When he died I did not know it, knowing a heart can never be mended surely. I have a friend who says that without sadness we cannot love the light, but I hate the light, I hate the false illusion. 

I hate my empty shell, now, for a laugh that's not coming back. We'd planned a family, before- how can I give love I don't have to some small child who deserves better?

These days the only thing that makes me happy is heroin

I am sorry for the wall of text, know that the existence of this sub has helped me feel not so alone in the universe. But I could use someone to talk. I could use a true friend who knows how I feel.

I stumble from the warm safe haven of my bed and crawl to the floor like that of a slug on its deathbed.

My childhood of not seeing my parents, all those years of being fucked with in school for being the fat kid that would go nowhere in life, all these scars on my wrists from the countless times I used to cut myself and wanted to see how deep the vein was, hoping I would accidentally nick it and end my sorry life, all those years spent in psychiatrist offices ""You suffer from what we call severe depression, ADHD, social anxiety, all those years of being a kid and locking myself in my room to just cry for hours......none of that matters anymore. I begin to feel it in my fingertips.

But is this how my life was supposed to be, should I not be the first person in my family to go to college. Am I cheating myself for the better or worse. Is that feeling in my fingertips saving my life or simply prolonging my imminent fall into my own demise. It is crawling up my arms

""Back the mack truck up for a second here...you guys are the cause for this shit. Albeit by my own doing that those results came back

how

* I was on 15mg x4/day for 7 months prior to entering their care.

* They immediately cut me down from 15mg x4/day to 5mg x4 day. Im hoping you all realize the fail written all over this move.

* Realizing this didnt work

* I cannot take the apap. Ive had acute renal failure(body doesnt process it well. I can take it

* My upper back hurts so bad, didnt bother to ask how i was doing. This wasnt in their records either.

* Next, 60mg 2x/day. fuck yea. Im dancing with my kids and throwin em around enjoying my life the way i was meant to.

* go in for follow up with a chip on my shoulder about this place already. tell them i doubled up on the meds because they suck dick and i want out of my contract so i can get somewhere with competent doctors who understand pain management and arent afraid of the DEA. Write me a referral.

* so they write me one detailing all the bad shit from my record there

* Ive been to the ER about 10 times in 4 months because i cant get on top of my pain without taking double my dosage. No longer able to be treated at ER for my back. 

To top it off i wasnt given anything to jump off this shit with so i had to endure the wonderful wd's again. thats twice since ive been here

This facility has effectively destroyed my medical history for any future pain management doctor i may come in contact with in the next few years. If theyd have just kept me on the same fucking medications i came in with, etc.

Fuck the east coast. This place is fucking garbage. Never had these problems out west.

My husband and I have been using h for approx. a year (only smoking, we were probably using between a half gram and a gram of black per day, an amount we were concerned about and, frankly, ashamed of. It had escalated quickly as is often the case when sales come into the picture. Fast forward a few months, selling is no longer involved because of the huge negative impact it had on our life (not only usage-wise, but because of the incessant calls from buyers, constant fear of getting caught up

That brings me to this afternoon, when someone suggested to my husband that the best way to wean ourselves off the last little amount (essentially, to maintain the very low usage level and allow our bodies to re-regulate while using/buying very minor amounts) would be to shoot it up. The argument, I guess, is that we could split a half gram over several days if injected, whereas smoking it requires more -- and our finances just don't have any room for more at this point.

If I'm being honest with myself, my questions: has anyone else received this as a suggestion for tapering off, or is this person misinformed and further passing along that misinformation to us? Would this be a good idea or a terrible one?

The last issue is that my husband prefaced the pitch with, tried to quit suddenly without a plan or ""getting in his kicks"" for lack of a better term] did and relapse because I didn't get it out of my system."" To me that sounds like it could be his mind trying to justify a questionable solution to a serious problem that we've spent months trying to remedy. But at the same time, if it's really something he wants to try, I do recognize that this is the absolute last time it will ever be an option. I am not as well educated about the effects of different usage methods (bio-availability and whatnot) like my husband is, and he seems to think this is a good recommendation, so I wanted to ask you all what you think: would it be worth it to try this as a way to wean ourselves off that last little bit we've been using or are we asking to set ourselves back? Or, if the tapering thing is a total no-go

I was smarter. I was stronger. I was better prepared. 
But Heroin knows that. It feeds into your psych. Most of us are above average intelligence, cheating, conning, slipping by unnoticed. Then we became addicts, and we couldn't beat it. We'd never lost to anything before, how could this happen? 
It happened because addiction is a part of ourselves. We finally had a formidable foe; ourselves. We rationalize and try to make sense of the losing battle

Once you're an addict you don't go back. You can be sober for 25 years but you're still an addict.**You fight every day to stay clean.**

If anyone has a personal story of beating a real hardcore addiction and staying clean for the rest of their life

Welp. Nearing the second week of an outpatient. It was a good run brothers. I hope each and every one of you stays afloat for as long as possible. I sincerely hope you don't need to hit rock bottom before realizing you need help

I consider myself a pretty honest person these days (and can be vouched for by a few people on here) but there was a point in my life when i would beat anyone for almost anything (worth $20 at least) This is a story of one of those days.


I was bored sick and sitting in my closet at the local ymca. I only had one phone connect at the time and he was a suburban kid about 3 years younger then me. I had a few open air markets within walking distance of the Ymca so i thought i can burn this suburban dope dealer

15 minutes later my girl scoops me and we head to the burbs. I tell her that I'm just gonna beat the kid up if i have to, and he'll be outside, i haggle over price for a min and tell him ill be there in 5. I'm panicking a little at this point as he has roommates and im not a fan of getting my ass kicked by 3 dudes while sick. My girl gives me $15 in ones to use as flash cash if needed.

we pull up and M is outside by himself. i get out of the car and he has the dope filled pack in his hand. i walk up and raise my hand to slap hands but instead in one smooth motion grab the cig pack

My tale begins with a rare occasion. I happen to finally reap the harvest of my blood, for the first time in months. I call up my bud to see what type of opiods he has, that may grace my nostrils. ""oh hey bud"" he says after picking up after three rings, his husky voice sounding like  music to my ears. ""lucky for you all my plugs got back from the pharmacy, And my medicine cabinet looks like a candy store. What to you want, I've got blues, opana 10 ir's and the white triangle dillies"" Sweet merciful lord, and on rare christmas like occasions the purplish gray 20's. Having a grand ready to spend on my supplies, the greasy little sub shop parking lot downtown. 

I practically skip over to his car and he hands me three baggies looking just as fat as they should be and he says he threw in some extra subs in a fourth larger bag, but hell who am I to complain? I just manage not to kiss him on the cheek as I jog in to hit the shops bathroom and chop out a line. As I sat down on my my porcelain throne I pull out a blue and an opa, lay them on my bill and grind them to a pulp with my bic lighter, I smile, realising I still have enough greenery to buy two ounces of greenery. I bend over and sniff the lines off of my 40 oz to freedom cd case I slipped into my denim jacket. Oh that sweet drip, the taste is so sickly sweet and bitter. My gaze lowers too the cd case as I swirl my finger over it and lick the residue off my fingers. Man bradley. Why did you have to boot that fat shot and off yourself. I never even got to see you live. A sigh slips out of my lips as my eyes roll back in my head and the warmth envelopes me. A big cheshire grin creeps onto my face and I chuckle at the graffiti in the stalls. a couple of toys trying to show off their handstyles and a dick here and there. One particularly vulgar line sticks in my mind ""dont be a quitter, put it in her shitter"". 

As I float off the toilet and back into the real world my mind is at ease. The tensions and stresses of my day are far and few between. I get a call from a close friend of mine (the only other user I partake with) saying he's in the area and asks if I want to go to a party with him. Im higher then flavah flave on helicopter with a crack pipe, Im dancing over to his car when he pulls up. Rhianna is the cutest most enticing perfect female I'd ever met, (except cayce, but thats another heartbreak to be told over another line). When I get to the party she practically grabs me by my jacket and pulls me into the guest room. Am I dreaming. Is this actually happening or is this some pipe dream induced by my own cocktail of drugs. 

No.

Its real.

- I sometimes go scrapping. A normal sized air conditioner can be broken down and scrapped for $25 - $30. You just have to know what you're doing when you're breaking stuff down. If I'm desperate
- I cop for people. I have tons of good connects and a lot of friends that don't or would rather have someone else take the risk when copping. Everyone I know knows I play fair so they look out for me
- Sometimes I'll park my car near a gas pump and give people a story about running out of gas and realizing that I left my wallet at home. I'll tell them I'm trying to scrape together enough just to make it back home. I dress nice for this and I'm good with talking to people. Sometimes I can make $20 in just a few minutes doing this.

Anyways, mostly because I just don't have the heart for it. I depend on my car a lot. Whenever I have car issues and I'm desperate, I'll just flat out pan handle. ""Hey man, I'm trying to make some bus fare, can you help me out a bit?"".

i went to the nearest sketchy area a mile or so away from where i live, who is also meeting 10, fucking TEN people at the same time in this very dark, poorly lit park. it was sketchy, but something about this homless guy told me id be fine.

got two bags of about .2 for £20 (about $30 or so) and i promised him a few rips off the foil. i didnt have any apparatus or rigs so he took me through a hole in a fence

in some rooms there were people sleeping in filth, and eventually convinced them to give me one of their clean, pre packaged rigs.

we then walked to ANOTHER abandoned place

we took turns ripping the foil, i was fucking ROCKED. i let him keep the tooter we made, since it had some leftovers inside he could use later. i gave him a couple of my 5mg valiums as well since he was the coolest and most helpful dude ive ever met.

the whole time we were chatting, money and a homless guy id never met until an hour ago, plus the fact we were in an abandoned complex that i doubt anyone would dream of going near... i still was totally at peace (and high as shit)

i said my goodbyes to him and his friend that i met

got home, but passed out with all my shit laying around me. luckily at some point in the night i woke up and cleaned it all up before passing out again fully clothed. woke up at 1pm today, feeling out of it, but much more clear headded after an hour or so.

my current debate is whether or not i go pick up my subbies today

ill probably take a hit, i dont regret it, and im not going to get more. it was a one time thing for me, and im super glad that i can remember how it felt, and know how bad it would be for me to even consider doing another bag. maybe in another ten months... who knows.

hope yall enjoyed this tale... i know its long

Essentially, and do not ejaculate either.  But the full wave of body ecstasy courses through me.  Repeatedly at that.  Minor stimulation of my flaccid member increase the pleasure, causing me to shudder and quiver just like the real thing.  It’s really weird. And really great.

1337969882.0,u4tf9,Interesting Heroin production facts (at least to me!),verichrome,21,3,28,"For a while now I have researched illegal drug production, etc.  Its all a fascination of mine.  Recently Ive been doing some research into heroin production over the past 20 or 30 years and learned that most of the heroin found on the east coast (ECP) is actually produced largely in Colombia (obviously more well known for it coca economy).  

Mexico has grown in the past four years to the second biggest producer besides Afghanistan (which accounts for 87% of worldwide production).  Im assuming this is what accounts for the huge spike in BTH which it seems is much much more widely available now than it was in the past.  And its probably safe to assume the growing demand for Heroin is caused directly by the spike in people using pharmaceuticals but anyway that is another topic....

I guess the point of all this is that it seems to be commonly assumed that (powder) Heroin found in the US comes from Asia however it seems as if Colombia account for the majority of it in the US.  Is this true?  

Anyway

So that might be translated, loosely, as 'morphine seeky' or even more loosely as 'morphine-seeking.'  I prefer 'seeky' because it implies you have an inclination to seek morphine.

""What the fuck are you talking about?""  Shaftoe says.

Empty parking lots
And deserted streets.
Intentions are clear
And plain for all to see
If I wasn't the only one who cared.
Nerves on edge
Waiting for her.
My true love
Who steals souls
Training my eyes to spot her a mile away.
Butterflies in my stomach
She's the only one
Who can make me so apathetic.
I see myself through another's eyes
For just a second
For just a second
I'm so pathetic.
I thought we were done
Thought I had forgotten all about her
As she's in my arms,
Like riding a bike
I could never forget the way she makes me feel
Happy and sad
She only takes a point
I'm the dumb ass rat
Terror mixed with exhilaration
Maybe I won't be so lucky next time
Illness finds a hole in bliss.
She makes me sick
As I hold her in my hands
I feel sick
As I pull her close.
Guts and Glory in the toilet bowl
With her on the bed screaming ""Let's have another go""
I give in
I used to love her
Said only nice things
Now she's nothing more
Than a whore I can use for the night
And forget in the morning.
Picking myself off the strangest floor
She'd left without a word
Ways I'd rather keep it
Things I would never change.
Maybe next time the trap will get me
I feel like I'm playing Russian Roulette
With a loaded gun.
Everyone's gotten off their high horse

The only downside to this cat paradise is we can never see them again. Its a secret place that take in cats that are supposed to be put down. Some anti animal putting down place ran by a vet who disagrees with animals being put down. The RSPCA do not know it exists

So, and will never be put down.

My next door neighbor is a junkie ""I've got a habit"" was the phrase he repeated constantly when I first told him I use dope while trying to be friendly when we first moved in and giving him a ride to 711. Anyway, probably because he wanted a ride to pick up. He's unemployed and doesn't have a car, so I always drive when I wanna score because I have no connects so when I score it's always by having him middle for me.

I said yeah I was leaving town and he was just ""all right, when I get there I find out it wasn't actually on our block like he implied, but fortunately I only hadda take us a few blocks away, just a five minute right.

I give him my $50 for the 5 stamps I wanted, fuck it, least I'm getting what I want all within 15 mins. I pick him back up, get my 5 and drop him back off on the street next to ours (I don't ever want my roommates to see us together, cause they'd immediately figure out why we were together.

I stop at my moms house 5 minutes away to give her a few bucks to help out, but seeing how scummily small they were, I did two and ate a mg of Xanax to give it a boost.

Felt it, barely feeling it. So I got here about 45 minutes ago, went to the bathroom and dumped out my other three bags on the counter, tearing apart the stamps and scraping out every last grain of the tan powder. I blew it all up and popped two more .5 mgs Xanax, washing them down with the rum and coke I'm drinking now. 

So now, 2 mgs of Xanax, and my tasty Captain cocktail, I'm actually feeling pretty fucking great. Not full uncontrollably nodding kinda high, but the step right before that. Hugged by invisible puppy clouds, itchy, warm and content.

And for the record, feeling my love and hanging out with my human love.

My normal doc was booked out one time so I went to a walk in medical center and that's where I was introduced to oxy. I was only expecting panadeine forte (30mg codeine

I've been back to this other medical centre numerous times, this dodgy fucker wants to stick me with needles and all I want to do is get high. If he tries to do it right now, I'm gonna have to refuse but it's going to look hella dodgy because apparently I'm in so much pain! Thankfully, he just gave me a referral to a neuro. Obviously I didn't call to book an appointment because I don't need no fucking injections into my neck.

The problem I have now is the prescriptions don't last long enough. I started in Jan with 5mg taken orally, then 15mg and now 20mg. How can I get more without resorting to stealing or sourcing it illegally. I just want as much oxy as I want, I don't think that's too much to ask. I need to go back to this dodgy doctor because I've run out of oxy and I was thinking about just asking him straight up to play ball and write me prescriptions for as much as I want.

We performed CPR until the paramedics arrived and took over but they got him to sit up and look around for a little bit before he nodded back out. On the way out of his house he was sitting up and we made eye contact.

 At this point what are the chances of him dieing? He's healthy as hell minus being a opiate addict. Works out a lot. I spoke with his parents and the paramedics and told everyone there what happened and what he was on. Based on them getting him to respond is there a good chance he is going to be okay?


EDIT: My friend is okay. We got him out of the Hospital a few hours ago around 2 AM eastern time. We live in Baltimore. First thing he asked was what we did with the syringes and the dope, I was reading these comments in the waiting room and it helped take some concern away. One of the paramedics made a comment to me that his lips were turning blue when they were resuscitating him and that if he were left alone that way he could have died.

What weird sayings/habits/meeting places/ways/idk... do *your* dealers have

**Edit**: Thanks everyone and keep the stories coming! Some of them are pretty funny, when I have other things I need to do. So I started telling them, ""don't say you'll be here in 20 minutes if you're not going to be here for several hours."" and a few of them are more honest about it now, so at least I'll be more realistic about what to expect. I also try not to call and bug them too much while I'm waiting, because I know it's irritating, and I don't like people doing it to me. When I stopped the habit of calling incessantly, they warmed up to me anyway.

I knew this one chick I used to buy from who is super-scary. She's just psycho, she just uses and fucks *everyone* over. She's also a thief that will lie *right to your face* about anything. I really don't know how she does it. It's really scary. And she always raises the prices on her pills. $10 for 10MG Vicodin? No fucking thank you! She has blackmailed me several times, and has lied to my boyfriend about things I do, etc. I was finally able to get her out of my life. I ignored her calls and texts, and after a few months she finally got the picture. It sucks that I lost a dealer, though with her, it wasn't worth it.

**On-Topic List**

1. Scoring from a dealer's house. He/she will tell you to come in 5 minutes quickly because he has a lot of work. You arrive under their house, my hunger for my medicine erases *any desire* to file a complaint concerning their services.

2. From my experience, and they try to placebo your brains. 

3. Dealers dissing other respectful dealers. I experienced one instance where a current dealer dissed the new batch of a very dark brown rocky H #3 circulates by another dealer of mine. Turns out

4. I am an exceptional client. Always give straight money, when the dealer is on a hard economical situation, he/she will not differentiate, and sell to me the same H cut with god-knows-what, with the other, unreliable junkies that BEG to purchase a 10euro dose every day with only 6-8 Euros. Some appreciation on my proffesional behaviour please!

5. What you call 'ballons' (i think), so that he/she will not notice the rip-off until they get home.

P.S. I am sure a lot of bropiates and femmpiates will tell me to change dealers. *However

I hope I didn't break any guidlines, and also post a topic that crosses my mind lately.
