1369872557.0,1fay6t,Shy's Ryze setup,Memorize21,93,8,8,"Yo Dyrus

In your video-analysis of the 2nd game vs Korea you said the runes/masteries you thought Shy was using but after looking at it they were different. And since you want to try or pick up Ryze I thought I'd give you a heads-up of what he used.

In your vid you said he used 9-0-21 masteries and MS quints + mana blues. But after looking at his lvl 1 stats he was using the following setup:


Masteries: 

0-9-21 Because of the following reasons:

He had 0 AP at lvl 1 which makes it impossible to have 9-0-21.

He had 482 health at lvl 1 which is 36 higher than his base (30 from Veteran scar + 6 per level from Durability)

He also had 345 MS which means he had 335 + 3% MS from the Nimble mastery.


Runes: 

Hybrid or Mpen reds

Flat armor yellows

Flat mr blues

Flat mana quints

Because at lvl 1 he had +16 armor and mr, makes both rounded down +16.

And the mana quints because he had 627 mana at lvl 1. Ryze's base mana is 305, 627-515=112. So we have 112 'unexplained' mana. Flat mana Quints are 37.5 mana, 37.5 x 3 = 112.5

If I recall it correctly these were the exact runes/masteries he used for all his Ryze games EXCEPT the 1st game vs EU

Hope it helps you playing/picking up Ryze.

Goodluck in the next split!",,t5_2vtnv,1369872944.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/LOLDyrus/comments/1fay6t/shys_ryze_setup/

I started watching you around the same time I played league, first it was bronze, then silver and then gold, and then I hit plat (when it was the highest) and in late s2 I hit diamond. I've been trying to q up with you since late s2 but failed really hard after many tries and got trolled by rainbow and ppl whos names I wont mention here... I just wanted to say that you helped me improve a lot as a player and a person, which drastically improved my quality of life, thank you Marcus or Dyrus whatever you personally identify with man. I would really like to meet you one day and that doesnt seem too hard since you hangout at events quite often we'll see how that goes.

(link to froggen interview)

 (if link doesn't work interview starts at 2:50:20)
I decided to post here to hopefully get noticed by you guys.

Basically i am looking for a team to cook for and after seeing the teams eating habits i feel like having a cook would benefit you guys to a great extent.
If you would like some more information i have a thread with pictures about it here.

I love way to many animes to list

honestly I just say clannad cause it was one of my favorites if we're going to go deep down there are great series like code geass or claymore or berserk and even the mainstream naruto or bleach. I like all of them but in the end the type moon animes and games probably got my top 5-10

2.Thought I would make a thread where everyone could pile all their questions for Dyrus about TSM's week 1 games against CLG

My question for Dyrus is how do you think you played in your games against


hotshot forgot runes like a derp but it's ok cause his team will carry him no matter what until he starts picking nasus or singed.

sycho sid needs more experience.

kiwi kid is going with the full retard strat where you pick singed and still do a lot. something I would of liked to do my entire league life if reginald didn't call singed trash.

kiwi kid has a wide champion pool and strong mechanics

my experience vs him he overextended as kayle

jayce/kennen is a better synergy with karthus


xin zhao is useless if you don't get any early ganks off try to drop xin 

zhao


sona can get ignite


vayne can get cleanse (if you know the enemy has cc)


good team comp

in team fights.


xin zhao should consider buying oracles mid game and telling team to 

4/5 man roam if organized team.





sidenote: elo advantage for this and last game


karthus should not stand in side brush level 1


vayne is afk needs to help xin zhao with wolves





karthus/riven does wraiths (good)

vayne/sona late to lane

graves janna (lane bully) try to survive and cs.


sona should max heal




just as I type that sona gets fb'ed (need to farm at tower)




bot lane is screwed again proceed to trying to farm at tower and 


begging for jungler help.




kat is good vs karthus proceed to farming (doing a good job out csing)





don't gank karthus mid lane until lvl 4 if you are relying on karthus to 


wall.




don't buy boots on riven/ rush brutalizer/black cleaver/ place ward 

when entering lane vs naut/shen gank combo (high cc)


freeze lane and ask for jungler ganks (thin up wave before ganking)


riven is winning in cs (gj)


vayne should max Q/W/E in that order


bot is screwed proceed to farm wolves and beg for jungler to gank 

lane. pink ward ganking through lane (enemy has full ward coverage)


jungle did good job using kat spells.


don't level up W on riven max Q.


don't trade when the enemy has tons of creeps that will trade back 

on autos.


bot lane should consider going 9/21 with hp quints and just farming all 

game to not get dominated.





riven kills shen 7:59 tell team shen is 6 and has ult. continue to 

pressure top and ward everywhere.


shen ults bot and counter ganks

shen tp's back top (no dragon pressure) proceed to abusing shen with 
no ignite.

karthus should get exhaust over barrier. tell team to man up and get 

oppurtunties to use karthus ult.



complain that your bot lane is losing with karthus ult potential ask 

jungler to babysit bo and pin kward brush.

maxing w on riven first is not that good max q or have lvl 2 e

10:54 good gank on kat mid somehggow dies to karthus xin with flash 

10 seconds away.





11:10 minutes into the game and karthus ult still has not been used

use communication to steal kills with karthus ult for mad bank $$$



stack doran blades 3-&gt;pd/berserkers greaves max W so you won't be 

useless with 25 cs to 100. continue to farm all game because graves 

is as big as doublelift.





kat dies again/ karthus can carry

ult and you will take half a bar if your team mans up.





13 minutes into the game

side of the map and do dragon.



don't start blue when karthus is clearing waves (can be stolen by 

janna tornado or graves ult if warded)

karthus flashes away gets double kill anyways. (look to suicide in and 

flash in when oppurtunties arrise.

riven karthus carrying the shit out of this game

don't build 2nd dorans on riven when way ahead proceed to full retard 

bt/black cleaver/ last whisper/ GA build

xin zhao 20 cs behind jarvan playing the support role to much

more selfish.


use smite whenever it's up unless before dragon.

after the 4 kills mid at 14:00 proceed to do dragon it is free.

after dragon buy group bup and siege all outer turrets that are still up 

with 3/4 people while having the remaining useless players (vayne) to 

cover other lanes and afk farm)



midgame have vayne free farm against shen (vayne counters shen in 

split push)

have bot lane go full hp quints cloth 5 to avoid feeding.

xin should stop at spirit stone and build into locket/aegis/spirit of elder 

lizard or golem -&gt; randuins/bulwark

keep in mind vayne will always lose early game so play passive to 

survive through early game unless you're draven.

at 15-20 minute mark laning phase ends

when low mana on karthus dont' turn e on so you can spam q unless 

you're going to die anyways.

karthus has the mechanics of a diamond player

early lizard item on xin is not bad if ahead and snowballing.

if your cs is below your enemies consider playing in a bot game and 

practicing csing for hours to improve mechanical skill. (same with 

jayce e/q combo)


after getting perfect cs go back to normal/ranked then slowly learn 

trading.

play 1 champion and repeat rinse until diamond 1.

buy oracles on support when winning.

vayne should consider not smoking weed when playing league of 

legends

try to use karthus wall on multiple people/ or to zone depending on situation instead of w on tank.

always remember to use summoners during important fights when 

needed.

BIG EDIT: This Xinsy fellow gave me my account back and talked to me on skype for a while. He told me his friend hacked the account and gave it to him. Not sure why he added me on skype after that though. Apparently he felt bad and gave me my account back. His friend apparently has done this to 100+ people. He said they RAT people and then sell any account they find of significant value. He told me he could have sold my account for $130 if he wanted to. After that, he got pissed and almost took the account back because he said that I got one of my friends to DOX him through his twitter, he tried to send me proof of it but I didn't receive it. I feel like this is a big problem, and I dont want this to happen to anyone else in the future. He had complete control of my webcam and basically my entire computer. He uninstalled league and i'm still in the process of getting it back. At this point, my main concerns are, I have ip spent on stuff that I didn't want to spend it on. I want to get rid of that.

1370070569.0,1fgddp,lessons notepad,Dyrus,42,10,10,"pick lulu/sona/janna with vayne


you can take ignite on support/exhaust vs assassins like zed


stack armor vs this team (game 1)


lux should go ignite vs most matchups but user prefered.


vayne should start dorans blade (can go lifesteal quints too)


when spreading out level 1 with organized team make sure one person watches mid also point defense is a weak level 1


1:38 taric vayne missed double golems


don't be afraid to harass zed he has no potions to sustain vs you level 1/2. every he goes for punish him


1st blood 3:54 taric needed to ward tribrush


4 minutes into the game jarvan is 0/0/0 gank top/mid or through lane bot with double buff. 


make sure smite is on cooldown before ganking.




if you know you're already dead don't waste flash


buy atleast 1 dorans blade on vayne/jayce bot lane should be crushing


max armor aura vs ad on taric. instead of stun


vayne max w or e vs double brusiers. max q for harass vs ranged.


zed can be a hard counter to jayce ask for ganks


jarvan build spirit stone into sunfire vs this team. build only up to aegis and build locket


in custom game practice jayce e q combo over and over until you are comfortable with it


jarvan still 0/0/0 9 minutes in. switch to hecarim or someone who benefits farming jungle for a long time such as 

mundo


jarvan gets 2 kills should buy before going bot next  time but turns out well anyways.


vayne needs to level up w and buy dorans blade/shield vs double bruisers/ taric needs dorans shield vs double 

brusiers.


lux is csing very well very little room for improvement at this level.


lux jarvan gets greedy for a kill gets double killed by talon


jayce kills zed 12:30 becareful of going in if zed had w can negate jayce power slam. also zed had flash in 10 

seconds


bot lane is pretty much lost/ build two doran blades on vayne and avoid boots. build pd/botrk or pd/bloodthirster 

instead of rushing vampscepter/boots 2.


14:00:14:30 to much pointless running around

farm current jungle. 


avoid staying around with low hp when enemy casters are nearby.


lux should build chalice and then move on to core items instead of athenes grail

boots 2.


jarvan should save ult for when enemy safeguards or flashes 17:29


jayce needs tabi/dorans blade for surviving vs zed


jayce should get blue with lux and 3 man mid/top while other two hold tier 2 or mid turret.


18:30 into game team should roam as 4 and let vayne solo farm bot

strong while having engage and disengage.


lux should avoid building zhonyas if possible and get void staff/deathcap asap to carry team harder.


all players should get atleast 1 dorans item as a first item if possible because of efficiency. (player preference)


jarvan should go locket vs mass ad brusiers/and stop at aegis over bulwark. building randuins or tabi and spirit of 

the ancient golems is perfect here.


jayce should go cdr boots for more poke/damage output.


taric should build sunfire cape along with jarvan for efficient anti ad brusier dps


game ended before jayce last whisper -&gt;GA


lux should go voidstaff&gt;deathcap in most cases until 3 items.


jarvan still needs boots 2 at 27:15


vayne should really build 1 dorans blade for the entire game.


taric frozen heart is a perfect choice for this game


jarvan did not need merc threads vs this team/ or jayce but it's still semi useful.


zhonyas becomes a strong item mid late game vs zed/lee/lis


jayce does not need to buy oracles


29:49 jarvan should be running instead of laughing/auto attacking jax baiting for jayce/lux


jayce dies.


enemy lee sin picks up jarvan spree (bad not worth)


vayne should really have taric stick around for most of the game and look for combo wall stuns with team.


vayne should just afk farm after dying 5-10 times and split push bot 123 cs at 31:27 minute mark.


send vayne bot when dragon is down

pushes.



thornmail is probably the best buy in this game next to frozen heart.





end game conclusion. group up lux/jayce sooner to siege mid have 1 for disengage split push with vayne

needs to make use of early ganks.

Previously you had told me that:

&gt; Dyrus- If reginald ever mentions we should hire a chef you will be the first one to know. I find it highly unlikely right now though I do agree a healthy diet would improve overall just everything

Immediately after I posted my previous thread, I am jobless.

Today, that I wanted absolutely nothing more than to be a part of e-sports, in any way shape or form. They then told me that if that is the way I felt, and that I wasn't going to get a ""real"" job, then I couldn't live at home any more.

I have absolutely no where to live (unfortunately I cant live with my girlfriend as she is in Hawaii still), but I would honestly rather not be a burden to them.

I'm not trying to play the ""pity"" card
 
Is there any way that you can talk to Reginald about having me cook for you guys? I hate to be so direct about it but at this point now

Hope to hear from you soon- Forfekte.

TL;DR- Got kicked out, no place to stay.

EDIT- I decided to re add the pictures from my other article in case you forgot.

1376282194.0,1k6ru5,[RE:]Dyrus Sleepy Vlog,Skillzonlol,33,9,11,"TL;DR: Me rambling on about how Dyrus has changed my perspective on life in general.

Hi Reddit, and I'm around the Plat-Diamond ELO. I'm going to be completely honest with you, I was that pudgy-half Asian that really didn't belong to any group at primary and intermediate school.

I was just that Computer nerd that spent all his time learning to code/playing games. I was bullied for pretty much my last years of primary, but always find a cooling sensation while watching a TSM member stream. I've always been a fan of Dyrus because I find so much of it relatable, plus I've always liked the vivid personality the TSM house always has. Ever since I watched Dyrus' stream I've been in somewhat the same 'moods' he is in and my personality kind of adapted to it. Even though this has happened, watching Dyrus has also inspired me to be motivated to do things in my life, this was one of the main impacts Dyrus has had on me, this also made me vow that one day, maybe at worlds I'll meet him.

Anyways, or just one hell of a play. Dyrus had latched on to me, and he let me into TSM and into his own personal life through Vlogs. Hearing him talk about his previous life issues always made me feel genuinely better. TSM has greatly shaped my personality and I wish them all the best in their future endeavours. In regards to League, I main Renekton, Rumble and for a short time, Elise. I pretty much follow everything Dyrus does and, so far it has worked out for me :)

Now in regards to this video; 
I'm going to be honest, you will bounce back. Just take a moment to realise that there are always going to be those people that just are full of themselves, but you have so much more than they do. You have a breathtaking personality from what I have seen, and your connection with the League of Legends community is outstanding. You always take everyones voice into consideration, and you're very grateful too. So just remember Dyrus, care for yourself too. Don't forget that. You've been with TSM for a year now, they know your emotions and they know your personality. So even if you do get mad, they understand. Even under all the heat and pressure. You've taught me to just carry on, but make sure you know that you do. You're a truly awesome guy

I don't know what else to type but... I hope I get to meet you at worlds Dyrus. One day,False,,t5_2vtnv,1376354021.0,,,t3_1k6ru5

  So you may ask yourself

I would be glad if you could answer this questions as good as you can

1.	How did you get into the Pro-Scene? Were you active on a competitive level in other games (if yes: which)?

2.	When did you realize that you are “above the level of the average gamer”?

3.	What does your family think about your job being a professional gamer? Have you ever been discriminated because of your job and most likely

4.	What do you think about the growth of eSports over the last 5 years (obviously with LoL being one of the major factors to it)
5.	What are the deciding factors for a professional gamer in order to be able to make a living off it? (Streaming

6.	Gaming houses are currently seen as crucial to be able to keep up with top teams

7.	We have seen Asian Teams winning many of the recent big events. Why do you think Asian Teams are beginning to overcome other regions?

8.	How does the average day of a Pro-Gamer look like?

TSM is in kind of a slump now as we all know

This is why we love you guys

Lately (at least deducting from vlogs and game crib) you guys have a lot of internal tention

So in my humble opinion. This is very unhealthy environment. ReginaId is getting smashed by community, even beginning with you, start talking more?

You always talk about getting more focused and professional. Listening to your boss or leader is not professional. For any team to work u need cohesion (or w/e the word is) Everyone must give something to get the best results.

I know it may seem hard to force a meeting, YOU should step up, get OddOne talking, get Xpecial and yourself talking, not fighting but discussing, what is good and what is bad within the team, what your ideas plan, getting communication working whatever you feel needs to be changed.

**Regi is under massive pressure and TSM is from what I see slowly falling apart. We do not want this as true fans

So don't take it away from us, for the sake of the team and TSM.

I love all of you guys and don't want to see anyone go

Good luck!

**TL;DR: I really love TSM and I know you love it too Dyrone, outside of the game, to get results in the game and get rid of the internal tention. Please read.**

I have never really looked into Gunnars before mostly because I wear prescription lenses

Do they really make as big a difference as advertised?

Do you get the fisheye effect after wearing them for a long time? that was one of the major concerns I read about when they first came out.

Does the amber tint have a big effect on color

Do the lenses get scratched up easily? I pretty much require anti scratch lenses or they get destroyed in a few months time.

I have also read that Gunnars tend to make far away objects more blurry

He makes mistakes just like anybody but he has the balls to admit to them and that is what separates a decent person and decent LoL player from a great one.

When I first watched Dyrus' stream I probably skimmed over it and shrugged it off. Quite a few months back though a friend of mine said something along the lines ""you have Dyrus' qualities when you speak and interact"" so I took another hard look. It clicked with me that Dyrus was just trying to do his best but still have fun while he streams. His general taste in music mirrors mine almost completely

He also possessed things I didn't...like actual skill haha. He occasionally raged but he's tried to control it so I've been taking everything he says in since I started following him.

Because of you; Dyrus

Because of you; Dyrus

Because of you; Dyrus

Dyrus almost feels like a long lost brother to me. He has brought out the best in me

This may be another one of thousands of fan posts but I just felt I needed to say this with all the stuff that has been happening lately.

So here's to Dyrus

I was wondering what is your opinion on the sudden 'hype' of Utility (9-0-21

These were the 'most likely' masteries that REapered used in OGN (based on his MoveSpeed and doranshield+pot start) http://www.finalesfunkeln.com/s3/#73K7vwdTZv761A

His runes were most likely MPen reds

I can see it work in SoloQ vs low damage toplaners who you can dominate (Shen etc.) or champions with no gapcloser. But as soon as you face a gapclose champion (or any champion who can all-in you)

What I do like about Utility tree is that it allows you to start cloth+ward+4pots.

I understand that the Utility makes you scale even better into lategame with the MoveSpeed, but doesn't it make your laning fase harder on most matchups (compared to 9-21-0)?

Thanks!

I played a game recently that went something like this:

* I was playing Cho'Gath top vs Jarvan IV
* I expected him to be aggressive early
* He went for a caster-line CS that I fought him over @ Lvl 2
* I won this exchange and should have killed him (I made a mechanical mistake)

Here I was in a weird position.  I ended up bullying when I expected the opposite and have a health/CS advantage.  I have no ward

* Do I stay in lane and hope my current advantage keeps me safe? (this is what I did)
* Do I back and lose my advantage? (He pushes and probably ends up with more CS than me)
* Do I sit in the bush and wait for him to push it back a bit?

The end result was that I stayed in sight and got ganked 30-40 seconds later by their jungler

What would Dyrus do?  I see that you've been playing a lot of Doran's Blade Kennen lately

WHAT THE EXTENSION DOES

It looks at your Pandora page open in Chrome
You can go into XSplit and get the text from that file and show it on your stream. No screen region needed.

Here's the page (thanks to untamed for making the extension): https://github.com/untamed0/Untamed-Now-Playing
There are two parts to the instructions: one for Chrome and one for Xsplit.

INSTRUCTIONS (please read these carefully):

Before everything: I noticed this script doesn't like being set up or having options changed when Pandora is open in Chrome. Just make sure the Chrome session you're working with is fresh and hopefully you'll be fine.

GOOGLE CHROME PART:

1. Scroll down
(some of the following instructions are from the github page)
2. Save that .zip and extract it somewhere you can keep it (I just have it in my Documents)
3. Open Google Chrome, click on Extensions.
4. On the extensions page
5. Click the ""Load unpacked extension..."" button (top left area of that page) and select the folder that came out of the .zip (should be named ""untamed0-Untamed-Now-Playing-0416897"" those last numbers might change though). This folder you select should contain folders named ""ico"" and ""lib"" and some other files. If there's another folder named ""untamed-0..."" look inside that.
6. Hit ""OK""
7. You should have a new button in the top right of Chrome that looks like a note. Right-click that and go to Options.
8. Change the directory to where you want (I made a new folder in Documents called ""unp"" and used that)
TIP: you can click on this bar [here](http://imgur.com/sez0U.png) and it'll change to [this](http://imgur.com/xPkVV.png) so you can copy the directory and paste it in your Options page easily. OPTIONAL: You can change the ""Plain text now playing format"" option to something like ""Now Playing: %s%"" (without quotes) to make the XSplit overlay say ""Now Playing: [song info here]"" instead of just the song info.


9. HIT SAVE &lt;-- this is important. It doesn't work if you don't do this. (You can leave the other options alone.)
10. Open Pandora in Google Chrome and start playing a song (any song)
11. Open up the folder you put in the extension's options. Look for a file titled ""unp_now_playing.txt"". You can open it and it'll have your song info in plain text there. It's probably best to leave it closed otherwise your text editor might complain at you every time the song changes.

OKAY NOW FOR THE XSPLIT PART:

1. You should have your normal scene. I guess you can check to see if everything is in order.
2. Add a new ""Title"" source in your scene sources.
3. Check the box next to ""Remote text update"" and I have it set to update every 5 seconds (updates at a reasonable pace but doesn't slow anything on your computer down). I also unchecked the ""Scrolling"" box (if you do this
4. Set the remote URL to the location of the text file where the Google Chrome extension writes your song info (for example
5. I left the Start and End tags at default. You can change text font, etc to match your liking.
6. THAT'S ALL. Now you should have plain text of what's on your Pandora without needing a screen region. I think this solution also looks cleaner than the screen region. Yay.

If anything goes wrong or if I wasn't clear of anything in these instructions

Enjoy and happy new year

1373440177.0,1hzsle,Rengar Triple Q Explanation,paulstep15,4,0,2,"Hey Dyrus / others

After watching the stream I figured I could provide some assistance with using Rengar's triple Q. The key behind this is the way Rengar's ulti works: it generates 5 charges of Ferocity. This means if you cast your ulti while sitting on x stacks of ferocity

For example, IMMEDIATELY Q when you hit 5, your next autoattack will be a Ferocity Q and your stacks will regenerate up to 4. When you leap on the target with the Ferocity Q (1st), you can then cast a regular Q (2nd), which will bring you to 5 Ferocity again for another Ferocity Q (3rd).

You don't have to cast the ulti with 4 stacks; if you want to incorporate either your W or E (or both) before the 3rd Q, in addition to Q, between the two Ferocity Qs.

tl;dr: get (2/3/4) Ferocity, click (QWE/QE/Q), click Q at 5 Ferocity",,False,,t5_2vtnv,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LOLDyrus/comments/1hzsle/rengar_triple_q_explanation/

After watching some of your streams, and I'm not sure if its a playlist or a station you are using, but see if these catch your fancy.)

[Enemies - Nag Champa](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UYjLrl2ySFw )

*These guys are an awesome instrumental rock band from Ireland. I listen to them all the time while playing League.

[A Tribe Called Quest - Steve Biko](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZItLBiHG9gc)
*One of the best hip-hop groups ever. If I could pick a song to see Dyrus nodding his head to on that little stream box

[B6 - Day of the Weird Beginning](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f5mCAODSuUY)

A fantastic electronic music producer from Shanghai

[Queens of the Stone Age - God is in the Radio](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nGf2wKDV-v8)

Really good rock band that doesn't really have any bad songs. I end my shift at my college radio station all the time with this song.

[Nujabes - Luv Sic Pt. 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jdQYzEc6wYw)

You might know this guy if you have seen Samurai Champloo. He was a fantastic producer from Japan

As Dyrus moved to mid lane, but now he is geared towards playing carry type champions rather than support tanks.

Yesterday was the start of my 1 week spring break and I am inside the entire week due to my knee surgery yesterday. Which I mean, isn't a problem as I would probably be inside playing league anyways.

I did not take part in the bench regi idiotic circlejerk and never thought he should be benched (since it's his own team what the fuck?), which creates discomfort and negates real talking between players. I don't wanna say i'm 10000% right but these are actually good points that regi should read and understand, it's just for the good of your team and for us fans! Koreans are doing so good because of how they're organized, why not be revolutionary in the NA scene and get organized like them as well? Please when you've time take a look at what this guy said and try and talk to regi about it, even if it's scary to talk to him about such big changes.
