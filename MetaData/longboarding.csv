Luckily me and a few people where there to get him out of the street. Anyways we called the ambulance and the took way to long to get there. He ended up fracturing his skull and getting an extreme concussion we still don't know if his brain is alright but since I was there driving a golf cart next to him and he reached out and touched it when he fell I now have the possibility of being charged with vehicular homicide. It's all just bullshit and it could have been avoided with wearing a helmet. So please weather it be a cheap ass Walmart helmet or a high class racing helmet,self,

As I write this

The mod team been working over the past few months to make a few major changes to the way /r/longboarding works

For our mobile app users - sorry

In this post, it's always available [HERE!](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/about/stylesheet)

***
***
***

####***1. Sidebar buttons***

This has undergone some major changes in the past while - from the previous wall of text, it's a lot easier to see what each button is for - especially when browsing on touch devices!

Our entire sidebar has been moved over to the wiki - which means that we have a lot more characters to play with

Also new are the ***""Newbie""*** and ***""Rules""*** Buttons. We're hoping that placing these front and centre will aid in reducing the number of frustratingly basic questions we get - as well as providing an resource easily accessible resource for you to show others who might need help!

The wiki is going to be an ever-changing collection of pages - so check back every now and then to see what's been added!

***
***

####***2. Flairs***

This might not come into effect for a few days yet (see section below for more) but eventually

Check out /r/longboardingcsstest if you'd like to see the system in action!

***
***

####***3. Flair Filtering and the Robot Apocalypse***

In [THE SURVEY](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/comments/1dmo28/meta_rlongboarding_problems_solutions_and/) that was conducted 2 months ago

Because of this, but it's the best one I've been able to find so far!

Oh, who's going to be lessening our workload by automatically flairing some posts. Want to help him do his job? Here's a few tips...

* Include the word *""HELP""* in all help posts
* Include the words *""QUIVER

This is really just a test

***
***

####***4. Rules***

Rules. They're not much fun

That said, and we need to make executive judgements. Hopefully this won't happen too often!

***
***

####***5. ""READ THE SIDEBAR"" Reminders***

In v2.0, I think that we can safely say that those are no longer necessary - so I've removed them all, save for one simple reminder on the [submit page](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboarding/submit?selftext=true).

***
***

####***6. Link Info***

Normally

Disclaimer: I didn't code this - it was stolen almost in its entirety from the CSS template

***
***

####***7. Selection***

Not really important

###^^GREEEEEN!

***
***
***

The rest of that code was a whole lot of backend stuff that's gonna help *us* out as moderators - but together

Over the past little while, it's always impossible to keep *everyone* happy.

That said
***
With that

###/r/longboardingcsstest

Here's some of the changes that we're considering.

Please note that the reason we're posting this is because we'd love some feedback! This is *your* subreddit

***

####**1. Sidebar**

*Woah

The most instantly noticeable change, it's a much more appealing sidebar than the current one! 

With a new section aimed *entirely* at beginners (and its own dedicated

The wiki-based system also means that when users ask questions

&gt;&gt; wat wheeels r best 4 a begginner? i want 2 slide

&gt;&gt;&gt; Check out [THIS](http://www.reddit.com/r/longboardingcsstest/wiki/beginnerguide#wiki_wheels) handy guide to slide wheels! Hope that helps you out!

***
The wiki system also means that it's *really* easy to change and add bits (unlike reddit's 6-month limit on editing/replying to posts)
***
***
####**2. Flairs**
See those coloured things at the front of many of the posts? Try hovering over one of them. Cool!

This is a system that's gonna help us to categorise more posts, it's necessary for the next change you may have noticed...
***
***
####**3. Post Filtering**
See those little icons in the sidebar, we have filters to hide...

* Memes
* Help Posts
* Quiver Posts

We can always add or remove options later on

While this solution isn't perfect

***
***
####**4. Rules**
Ah, but we're open to input! Feel free to have a read through, by clicking on the dedicated button in the sidebar of /r/longboardingcsstest.
***
***

That's it for now. While there's a whole lot of other changes

**Got some opinions?** 

**Ideas?**

**Found a spelling mistake

**Do you have a really delicious recipe that I should cook  for dinner tomorrow evening?**

I'm 24, then shifted the focus to developing some solid production models. 

Besides designing and building boards, I designed and coded the Nelson website and designed most of the board graphics. I generally don't have much time for sleep, but I love all of it. The longboard community is awesome and I've met so many cool people in the last few years.

That's going to happen on 2/1/13 at 3:30am/pm US Central time. Weve made some updates

This thread is to welcome in no particular order /u/Xuis

Things like the new logo. its about time. Also

The Side Bar
---

The new sidebar has been reorganized to help new users learn a bit about us, ""Racing Lines"", the much loved post about cheap replacement hardware, commuter tips, a video about making your own slide gloves, application and removal of grip tape a new coupon for redditors and a 'last updated' so you know when some thing has changed.

Our aim was to make the side bar as idiot proof as possible. Thats why when you hover over a link you will get a brief summary of what it leads to.

We do ask that when you point someone to the sidebar you either name the bit that will help them most or link to it.

Now and Tomorrow
---

Part of the reason the new mods were appointed was because you all spoke out, but hopefully its stuff you wont actually see. Things controlling the flow of spam, Removing insulting comments that provide nothing to discussion and staying on top of the spam filter.

This means that if your post got stuck in the filter you can not only message the mods but now they'll actually respond! The same applies to the report buttons.

We plan on updating the board selection guide with links

But lets talk about what you will see. These Ideas are in the early stages but we want to do a weekly question thread where you can ask about any topic (longboarding related) and have a straight answer. We also want to do a weekly 'Gear Thread'. This give everyone to talk about new purchases

since yesterday a couple of other topics have been brought up that we will also discuss.

I was skating down my street this morning at 7:45AM peacefully on my way to the train station/ work when a white VW Golf spots me and throws on it's hazards and veers towards me into my lane. (he was driving the opposite way). Everytime I tried to adjust out of it's path it moved to intercept me. However I did slalom my ass around it after a second. I turn around in disgust of what an asshole driver this is and then the car goes in FULL REVERSE as fast as I've ever seen a golf go in reverse after me. I don't stop until I see a car about to park and I'm boxed in so I hop off. At this point a cop hops out of the passenger seat (this is the first inkling I had that it was a cop and not just your average aggressive asshole) and he's screaming at me about how dangerous and illegal that I'm skating in the street.
