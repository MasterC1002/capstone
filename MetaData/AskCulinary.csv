Hello r/askculinary! Firstly, our community here will hopefully not only be one of the best culinary forums on Reddit, but on the entire internet as well. Very few website have a community as knowledgeable as our community here.

However

In the past few months, the more the quality diminishes. For most websites, this is not really a “problem” as this change is just a representation of your audience.

However, to increase your understanding of cooking, and to share valuable culinary knowledge.”

If we are to stay true to our goal
 
**This is where we need your help r/askculinary. In order to uphold our goal here

We have an outline on what we want to see from the community

**Posts: We want to see posts that add conversation to our community.**  Remember, food science, technique advice and improving your food in general. Take advantage of this!

* Posts need to be specific

* We are not here to provide recipes. Any post asking for generic recipes will be removed without hesitation.  We are here to troubleshoot the recipes, troubleshoot and critique the recipes, not to provide them.

* Posts that mainly have to do with kitchen professionals or that are directly related to a professional environment are not suitable here. r/kitchenconfidential is your home for strictly professional responses to strictly professional questions. These include posts for war stories, or industry advice. r/kitchenconfidential is filled with a much higher proportion of industry professionals than we are.

* Use the search function. Many questions you have are very common and have been answered thoroughly in the past. Don’t waste our time by posting something that was just posted a month ago.

* If you have any question on the validity of a post

* If you see any post that you feel is inappropriate

**Comments: We want to see comments that are precise and either answer the question fully or add to the conversation in a positive way.** The more detail you provide

* Comments must be accurate and well informed. You do NOT need to be a chef or work in the industry to comment. You do however have to be informed in your response. We realize cooking is very subjective and in a lot of cases there is no “right” way to cook something. With this being said

* Your comments must be precise and well written. Short one or two word responses are not appropriate. Elaborate as much as possible while keeping true to the question. If you don’t have anything that adds to the conversation and are just posting some personal anecdote

* Keep your comments on topic. This is not a place to joke, not to get a chuckle in.

* If you see anything that violates these rules


**Remember

Speaking of mods, let us know. It is a thankless job that can take a good portion of time, so be warned. Send us a message if you are interested and we can provide an outline of what the duties specifically are.

Lastly, we have a major sidebar renovation in the works as well. This will be implemented in the near future and we will follow up with a mod post when this occurs. This new sidebar will hopefully outline our goals and intentions better and be easier and more understandable to read.

Thank you r/askculinary and cheers to the future!

1.  Use the FAQ. Questions about knives, books? It may very well be in there.

4.  Less-best questions are those like “I have a piece of salmon

Hello /r/askculinary! First of all, and hope you continue to provide the community with such helpful and thoughtful conversations.

With the rate of growth we have had the past few months

Our main concern is about some of the questions that are being submitted.

* **Recipe based question**s - If you refer to our current rule #5 located in our sidebar, you will most likely get many great answers through google, or even other sub reddits. /r/cooking, /r/food or /r/recipes are all options. However, we understand there are some recipe based questions that are more uncommon, and harder to find legit answers, and in that case, [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/uulzx/whats_your_favorite_goto_burger_recipe/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vcrfg/i_love_soup_but_hate_hot_summers_cold_soup/) are not desirable here. Questions like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vesqp/how_could_i_modify_this_recipe_for_nutella/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/pvesc/my_red_enchilada_sauce_always_seems_to_be_missing/) are fine however. Notice the difference in the quality of the question. The OP provides much more background and information in the posts that are well written. The more specific you can make a recipe/ingredient based question

* **Discussion based questions** - This sub reddit and community was created to help people become a better cook, we feel this is not accomplishing our original goal. Questions like these three([#1](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/twp9r/line_cooks_and_chefs_what_was_your_worst_kitchen/), [#2](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/tmk7o/everyone_has_been_experimental_in_the_kitchen_so/), [#3](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/urebw/chefs_of_reddit_what_was_the_most_fatal_mistake/)) are not very appropriate here. Perhaps /r/KitchenConfidential is better. That being said, posts like [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/ty7uh/raskculinary_what_are_some_of_your_little_magic/) and [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/vcqn6/i_liked_the_culinary_vice_responses_so_much_what/), are completely fine. Basically, if the answers to the question being asked would help the community in their culinary adventures, we feel these do not fit in here.**

* **Question and comment formatting** - **With every question you ask, the more through you can be in your responses and comments, the better. Try to avoid those one or two word comments, make it as thorough as you can. We are aware that this is not always possible or necessary, but try and make your posts as thoughtful as possible.

My grandmother first opened her business in 1983 in Indonesia. She started selling fried chicken in front of her house and it became widely popular. She expanded by moving to another building on the same street and turned it into an open-air restaurant: a huge open space under a shade. Even though the place easily seated 200

My grandmother's fried chicken is nothing like KFC's. It's traditional Indonesian fried chicken. The chicken is seasoned with spices until yellow, so they never feel gimped.

A few years later

Sadly, the restaurant isn't able to attract new customers; its current customers are the old, loyal customers. Competitors mushroomed and the restaurant feels too old-timey (so the younger generation isn't so keen on it). However, my grandmother already made her fortune from the 10-20 years of glory, starting from a humble business in front of her home.

**Related Problem #1-b**: How ""filled"" should the sausages be before they are twisted into links? Should I press as much in there as I can

[A little Foodporn](http://imgur.com/a/iAMN4)

First things first, black pepper, and salt.  I also know there was more to it than that, based solely off of the innumerable amount of dry rub recipes out there.  If someone has personal experience with a particular one, I'd love to try it out.

Next step was brining the shoulder.  I used the dry-rub as a brine, or what.  I also seem to remember it was an 18 hour process.

After the brine, I'm thinking of adding some garlic and onion this time.  Maybe even a tiny habanero.  Again, the only step missing here is what did I put in the dry-rub.

The next part is the oven.  I'm pretty sure I did it overnight, the blackness at the bottom of the pan scared me at first, but it turns out that it was pretty delicious.  The gooey blackness ultimately ended up in the crock-pot with the rest of the shredded pork goodness.

The next part is the fun part.   The sauce.  I have no clue what I used to sauce the shredded pork.  What I do know is that I wasn't going to waste this time and effort just to pour KC Masterpiece on it.  I remember making a concoction of tomato paste, brown sugar, and a few other things.  This is another point where you guys come in.  I need a sauce that's going to give this animal that BBQ identity.  Something sweet/spicy/savory, but doesn't overpower the meat.  I'm very open to suggestions on this one, so if you've got something and don't mind sharing it, I'm all ears.

So that sums it up.  I appreciate any suggestions that y'all are willing to send my way

1359130247.0,179drg,Chili precision,samtresler,127,15,37,"The annual chili competition is tomorrow (~12 entries). I've entered three times. I took home first once and didn't even place twice. There is no time limit

In year's past I've gone with my standard recipe which is a beef/pork/lamb mix, coffee, chocolate (more or less). The key was always to heat it up and allow it to cool three times (lid sealed whenever in danger zone, refrigerated as soon as low enough temp, and reheated for a substantial time before the final serving). 

This year I want to try something different. I'm looking for some advice on plan of attack, and then get to the recipe which will reflect how I plan on trying to address these questions. 

I like making the powder

Do the fruitier chiles lose there bouquet over prolonged heating? In beer brewing, and late additions, or even dry hopping allow for the citrusy and floral aspects to come through. I'm going to go with a late addition of roasted red pepper, and fresh poblano to hopefully carry more of the fresh, fruity pepper through to the final product. 

Do all the meats flavor carry through? In the past I've used ground meats of lamb/pork/beef. I think this year I want to use cubed tri-tip and ground pork

Is masa worth it? I've always thickened with masa, there is no starchy-action going on there. I think I'm just going to reduce this batch to desired consistency and then a masa to taste. 

How important is umami with the flavor of the meat? I'm thinking of going with some pureed anchovies with this. However, and I think that may have been why. Advice here is much needed. 

Ok - the plan: 

Prepare the chile pastes - Seed and toast the flesh of 1/3 ancho, I think this will be about 3/4oz each, but will update when I see it on the scale) in a dry cast iron skillet. Transfer to pot, cover with chicken stock and a shot of vodka, simmer until rehydrated. Transfer all liquid and chiles to blender or food processor and puree with 3-4 anchovies, 4oz chopped carrot, 4 oz chopped celery

Prepare the powder - Same combination, garlic, oregano, or salt here, those can all be added independently, this is *just* chile powder. 

Cube the tri-tip in 1/2-3/4"" chunks and brown in pork or beef fat on very high heat. Each side needs to get a really good sear

Brown the pork in small batches reserving fat. I'm using ground pork here to vary the texture of the end product. I'm contemplating just getting pork shoulder and cubing it in 1/4 chunks? Thoughts? 

1 c. finely diced onion gets carmelized in the same pan and transferred to the stock pot. 

4 cloves finely crushed garlic added to the stock pot with some fat and sweat. Shortly after garlic becomes aromatic, the meat, 1 cup strongly brewed coffee, 3-4 TB better than bullion beef, 2-3 oz dark chocolate bar, and your chile puree. Simmer for 3-4 hours with lid cracked open, stirring regularly. *edit: I usually add 3oz cider vinegar here too*

Cool

Roast one red pepper and one poblano and peel

That's it. Thoughts or advice? Also

update #1: Chile's toasting. Ended up being 1oz / 1oz/ .25oz (arbol). The arbols are just too thin walled to get a full 1oz out of without having so much to burn your face off. 

update #2: It's all in the pot. I used red wine instead of vodka, I also all but eliminated tomatoes from this recipe, so that accounts for that. And the beer I used is an irish stout I brewed last year, which is near-black, so that attributes to that.

There has been a fair amount of discussion about what makes a good question or a bad one. There has been a lot less about what makes a good answer. Following the example of /r/AskHistorians

Cooking, because cooking usually comes down to taste, and taste is subjective. Therefore we will never, and could never, be too stringent. However, there are still some guidelines everyone should consider when choosing how to respond to inquiries.

**Do I

If the answer to those questions isn't absolutely ""yes, food and cooking. We want to be a repository of expertise, both professional and non-, to address those questions. **Answers that don't further the conversation in a meaningful way are worse than no answers at all.**

It goes without saying that moderators can't police every comment always. The upvote/downvote process is the best way to sort good answers from bad ones.

ALONG THOSE LINES, but we want flair to be a representation of proven expertise and excellence in question answering.

It's worth unpacking that last bit a little.

Expertise is simple: you know what you're talking about. This doesn't mean you're a professional. Some of the best commenters don't have professional experience

Excellence in question-answering is related, easy-to-understand fashion that anticipates follow-ups and answers them too**. The best answer is contextualized to the question; If the person asking is a novice, a brief answer is less helpful than one that gives context and explains, for instance, why a dish is best prepared in a certain way.

It is also important to **consider if the answer you are giving is answering the question asked**. Questioners are usually attempting solve a specific problem and general ruminations on the topic will not be of any particular use to them.

Finally, not with abuse. If you find someone has been rude to you, please report it to the mods instead of engaging. Arguing on the internet is not a good use of anyone's time.

1373161569.0,1hs3nv,Cooking duck in the slow-cooker: UPDATE!,ChampagneFloozy,124,25,24,"Hi, and the meal turned out *freaking amazing.* I impressed myself

I wanted to use my slow-cooker, lively flavors to a roast/slow-cooked meal, because it is summer and heavy braises/flavors are not appealing to me this time of year. 

I broke a ""rule"" I've often heard - never try out recipes and foreign techniques on guests. I'm glad I did! So here's the basic recipe for the duck (and the rest of the meal)

I bought two ducklings, I put into the slow cooker two oranges, one lemon, and an apple, all cut into 8ths. I also added an onion and one fennel bulb, both thickly sliced, as well as 1/2 a can of OJ concentrate and about 2 cups of chicken stock. I set the legs on top of all that and set it to 8 hours/low. 

When I got home the timer was just going off on the 8 hours. I drained the liquid off and put the legs back into the slow cooker, then added about a half cup of Verdelho Madeira and let it continue to reduce on med-high heat. 

For sides, cut them in half and tossed them with salt and pepper and EVOO and roasted them for 20 minutes at 425. One things I have found with roasted potatoes, brussel sprouts, and turnips - don't stir them up halfway through the roast, as some recipes call for. I put them, flat side down, on the pan and just let them stay that way the whole cooking time

I also happened to find white asparagus (wtf? Its not spring!) at Harris Teeter, I blanched them in water with salt, lemon, and butter for about 20 minutes. Served with some fresh chopped parsley.

I also served a watercress salad with lemon, and it was a perfect bitter counterbalance to everything else on the plate. 

I didn't do a whole lot to the duck breasts. Just scored and seasoned with salt and pepper and cooked them in my cast iron skillet. I don't have a huge amount of experience with duck breast but the technique I found online seemed to work really well - I put the breasts skin side down in a COLD pan, then flipped them back to the skin side and popped them in the 400 degree oven for about 4 or 5 minutes. They were awesome, a really nice med-rare!

The sauce, a result of the citrus rinds, I'm sure. I added about 2 teaspoons of sugar to balance that, as well as another splash of Madeira, and it did the trick to balance it out. [EDIT: I forgot to add, I did thicken the sauce with about a tablespoon of cornstarch] Also, that touch of sweetness to the sauce was also a great counterbalance to the watercress and the tiny bit of bitterness in the white asparagus.

Everything on the plate matched so well with everything else. It was such a fantastically unified meal

At one point,"" leaned over to me and said, ""This is fantastic. And very classically French."" I can't tell you how proud I was.

We served it with a bottle of Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt Josephshofer Riesling Spatlese

1368360147.0,1e6h40,"I'm trying to learn to cook, and I just cooked the first steak of my life. How did I do? What can I do to improve?",Gravizt,117,29,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/1e6h40/im_trying_to_learn_to_cook_and_i_just_cooked_the/

I like cooking, but for the sake of receiving help, heres what I did.

I swabbed down the steak while warming the pan, and some pepper. Once the pan was smoking hot I threw the stake into the dry pan, and flipped it over ever 30 seconds. I did my best not to poke and prod at it too much while cooking. Total cooking time ended up at 5 minutes. Then I let it rest for around two minutes. I was shooting for medium, but it ended up leaning more towards medium-rare. It was served simply, with some rice and pepper sauce, which I'm sad to say came in the form of powder, out of a bag at the shops. I need to learn to make a proper sauce once.

There are some things I know I did wrong. The steak was not room tempered when I began cooking. It had come out of the fridge a couple of minutes prior to cooking. I was too impatient. This made the stake quite a bit more rare then I wanted it to be. I didn't have a proper heavy bottom pan either, but it was still fairly juicy. Not as juicy as I had hoped, but juicy enough.

Anyway

So we just moved from New York to Oregon. I have two cats. A friend of mine agreed to pick up our cats from the airport and watch the bastards for **three weeks** while we drove across the country. THEN

I told him I'd cook him a five-course meal for going through all this trouble and occasionally jokingly offer to add an extra course for every great thing he does for us.

Anyway, from scratch.

&gt;First Course: Appetizer

&gt;Oysters on the half shell - sparkling apple mignonette

I've got this great asymmetrical bowl that I'm going to pack with ice and display the oysters on.
I've also got this great five-piece tasting spoon set

**Question**: One per person or two per person? I'm not sure if two is too much or if one is not enough?

&gt;Second Course: Soup

&gt;Gazpacho

Plain and simple. Served in a martini glass with a slice of cucumber as garnish (like a lemon wheel).

&gt;Third Course: Salad

&gt;Caprese Salad with avocado and greens. 

One slice each of buratta, too and dress a small handful of greens with it. 

&gt;Fourth Course(?) - Intermezzo

&gt;Limoncello Sorbet

Does the intermezzo count as a course? Never figured that one out. It is just a palette clenser

**Edit**: So it's been pretty well established that the intermezzo is a little excessive and somewhat unnecessary. At this point I really just want to do it for no reason. Still trying to figure out where to stick it.

&gt;Fifth Course: Entree!

&gt;Scallop Piccata over linguine.

**Question**: How do you typically garnish a pasta dish?

**Question**: How would you present this?

I think I need the most help with this one. I have no idea how I want to present it, I have no idea how to present it or garnish it. Any and all suggestions are super appreciated. 

&gt;Sixth Course: Dessert

&gt;Strawberry Poppyseed Ice Cream! 

I'm going to scoop the ice cream in the size and shape of a strawberry and arrange mint leaves on top so they look like strawberry leaves. I'm also going to roll the scoop in loosely scattered poppyseeds on the outside of the ice cream so it looks like seeds.

I think I might also slice fresh strawberries to put around the rim of the bowl.


So that's the menu. I'd love to hear what you guys think of it

Edit: lots of edits made to the menu based off of suggestions made. I can't thank you guys enough. Also

Edit 3: It's almost 2 and I'm headed to bed. Thanks all for participating

Edit 4: Some folks have asked for my credentials. The last time I worked in a professional kitchen was back in HS when I did a summer at Pizza Hut. I've never been to any culinary school, learning, absorbing and pulling in every bit of knowledge, practice and technique that I possibly could about food and cooking. I've hunted down rare manuscripts in libraries and on the web to study them. I've made more dishes than I care to count where the only purpose was to try out a technique or some such. Can't count the number of times I've fallen asleep reading a cookbook or author's bio.

I like to think of myself as an expert amateur. In other words think of some old guy out on the farm who has been a gun nut/collector all of his life. He owns dozens of collectibles,000 yards. He can talk about the history of any gun, any maker, any ammo. How does he compare with the military sniper who has enough decorations on his chest that walking near a pool while wearing them is dangerous? Both do the same thing and it would be dangerous to say which is better, they are just different. For all of my love of food I've NEVER dreamed of owning a restaurant. That's not for me.

The meat came tied with string into a tight cylinder. I seared with the string on and also braised with the string. Should I have cut the string? Would that have let more juice go back into the meat?

Should I have braised at 250 for longer or was 350 ok? Come to think about it

We hope you all had a happy holiday and more importantly

In the last couple of weeks

With our rapid increase in size we feel it would be beneficial to explain to the newcomers and remind our regulars what /r/askculinary is all about.

We are, we do have rules to encourage quality posts and comments. I would like to clarify and reiterate our rules and guidelines here.

**Most importantly, you will be better off posting in either of those subreddits. Specific, detailed questions to which we can give specific, detailed answers serve our overall goals much more.

In addition, such as what school to go to or how to get into the industry are better suited to /r/kitchenconfidential or /r/chefit. Casual questions like, “What is your favorite thing to cook?” or “What is something cheap and easy to make?” are better suited to /r/cooking. These questions get better response in other more general communities.

There is also a new rule that we became aware of. **Any post that is asking whether or not a dish is safe to consume could be construed as medical advice. This is against Reddit's site-wide ToS and thus will be removed immediately.** I know it seems foolish to have to be this extreme, there is only one appropriate answer to the question: ""If in doubt, throw it out""

**We have a great FAQ and archive to search of previously answered questions.** Please use these to avoid reposting questions that have been thoroughly answered. Yes

Lastly, your technique and exact procedures you followed and ask a question as specific as possible. The better your question is, the better our answers can be.

In terms of comments, much like /r/askscience has. Firstly, we are a more “serious” subreddit than most.** Jokes, memes, puns and off-topic comments will be removed.** All comments must be accurate, well informed and either answer the questions fully, or add interesting discussion to the topic at hand. If your comment does not fulfill these goals, misinformed or vague responses are not appropriate here.**

We hope you realize why these rules are necessary and need to be enforced. With our numbers currently

Hey

I'm cooking a steak for the first time. I would estimate the last time I had a steak was at least 10 years ago.

Things I have: 

* 1 top sirloin steak. I'm sure it is shit quality. There is some marbling. It looks like it is an inch thick.
* Some cuisinart pans that I probably got from walmart.
* A stove. I don't have a grill.


This is my general plan:

1. Take the steak out of the refrigerator. Rub it with some salt and pepper. Leave it out for about an hour to get it to room temperature and make sure the salt isn't making it dry.

2. Put the pan on the stove. Get it smoking. Throw some crisco vegetable oil in there.

3. Put the steak in the pan facing away from me. This is where I get lost. I have no idea how long I need to cook the steak for. I am a little afraid of undercooking it and getting sick. I may have a meat thermometer

Any other advice is appreciated. I've read the sidebar and FAQ.

I've made my mom's chili recipe a handful of times and the girlfriend and I are wondering how we can take it to the next level. Here is the recipe:

1 1/2lbs ground bison
2 medium onions sliced
1 green bell pepper sliced
1 orange or yellow bell pepper sliced
1 large can crushed tomatoes
1 to 2 (15 oz) cans of diced tomatoes (usually use about 1.5 cans)
1 (15 oz) can of tomato sauce
1 (15 0z) can of black beans
1 (15oz) can of red beans
Several TB of chili powder (read: a shitton)
1/4 Tsp cumin
Red Pepper Flakes to taste
jalapenos sliced- optional

Brown bison. Remove from pot and set aside. Saute peppers and onions until softened.  Add meat back to pot. Then add crushed tomatoes, cumin and chili powder.  Simmer for at least an hour. Then add beans, spices and and jalapenos to taste. Continue simmering and fiddling with spices until everyone is starving.

Some ideas we had: 

1.) Add beer

2.) Use better spices. I was thinking that using fresher chili powder from Whole Foods might give it a stronger flavor without having to dump in as much.

3.) Use something better than jalepenos. Or learn how to use them better. The ones I buy always have flesh that seems as mild as a green pepper, which is like a double-barrel shot of spiciness to the chest. Maybe I should add them when I first mix it all together and give it more time to stew?

4.) Try it in the slow cooker? I'm not opposed to this, I don't want to turn them into mush

Totally open to any suggestions. I like the idea of taking my mom's recipe that I've been eating ever since I was a kid and evolving it into my own after some experimentation. 

**EDIT:** OK

1.) Cook a couple strips of bacon in the pan before cooking the bison and vegetables. (My GF needs to eat lean meats so we can't go too crazy with the bacon fat)

2.) Use better spices. I'll get authentic chili powder

Does anyone add beer? Instead of adding it to the chili next time I think I might just make a batch of beer biscuits to go along with it. Freaking. Delicious. 

**EDIT 2:** 

Ok, obviously. Here is what I think I'll attempt next time. 

1 1/2lbs ground bison
Few strips of bacon
2 medium onions sliced
1 green bell pepper sliced
1 orange or yellow bell pepper sliced
1 large can crushed tomatoes (Muir Glen Brand)
1 to 2 (15 oz) cans of diced tomatoes (Muir Glen)
1 bottle of dark beer
1 (15 0z) can of black beans (Or dry
1 (15oz) can of red beans (Or dry
Several TB of chili powder (Either fresh or the authentic stuff)
1 tsp cumin
Chipotle Peppers
few cubes 85%+ dark chocolate

Cook bacon in skillet. Remove bacon and brown bison in bacon fat. Remove from pot and set aside. Saute peppers and onions until softened. Remove from pot and deglaze with bottle of beer. Add meat, crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, cumin, chili powder, and chipotle peppers. Simmer for at least an hour. Then add beans and chocolate. Continue simmering and fiddling with spices until everyone is starving.

Additional Questions:

1.) If I use fresh or authentic chili powder is it better to mix it in with the tomatoes or should I still cook it in with the ground meat? 

2.) Should I add the chocolate in with the beer or should I wait until the whole thing is stewing?

&gt;2. Stir together sugar, baking powder, baking soda and salt in large bowl. Add eggs, milk, oil and vanilla; beat on medium speed of mixer 2 minutes. Stir in boiling water (batter will be thin). Pour batter into prepared pans.
&gt;3. Bake 30 to 35 minutes or until wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean. Cool 10 minutes; remove from pans to wire racks. Cool completely. Frost with ""ESPECIALLY DARK"" CHOCOLATE FROSTING. 10 to 12 servings.

The cake came out as pictured above (both layers).  The hard part is only on the surface.  Under and around it the cake is fine.  I was able to remove the hard parts

**Grid Method**

[Here's an example of what seems to me the most common method](http://youtu.be/zVr3z4HfpeI?t=11s)

1. parallel vertical slices from above the onion down to the board
2. slice(s) parallel to the board
3. slice latitudinally

EDIT: Scrofuloid mentioned [this method of avoiding the parallel cut in the grid method](http://youtu.be/yP3CiyEKEfU?t=2m17s) from Helen Rennie.

EDIT: A [demo from Sur La Table](http://youtu.be/A78iGzJTLp8?t=36s) shows substantially the same approach.

EDIT: joanty mentioned [Gordon Ramsay's instructional video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TwGBt3V0yvc) showing the grid method

EDIT: joanty also linked to a great Eric Crowley [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qHj4a3_dVLQ) that totally skips step #2

**Fan Method**

[Here's Alton Brown doing a simpler ""fan"" method](http://youtu.be/1-6_z17MinY?t=4m40s).

EDIT: He does the same [in a promo video](http://youtu.be/cEAiC7AIXW8?t=8m50s)

**Diagonal Method**

[Saw this one today](http://youtu.be/UHQc7QUJT4o?t=2m11s)

He's doing:

1. parallel diagonal cuts going one way
2. more parallel cuts from the opposite direction
3. perpendicular diagonal slices

Am I missing any common or special methods? Am I right to think Alton's ""fan"" method is mostly useful for avoiding the potentially dangerous cuts parallel to the board needed in the grid method? Does anyone have experience getting different size minces using something other than the ""grid"" method? Apart from going to a mandoline or other purpose-built tool

6 large onions (I LOVE onion)

3 peppers

""Madras"" hot curry powder (4 tbspns)

- I attack the chicken with a meat cleaver. Once I've got it down to around 8 large pieces, ribcage, etc), and browns. These two stages (above and this) take around 30 minutes.

So this is how I do it:


**Step one**: I chop a 10lb curd up with a butcher knife into small chunks and toss the chunks into a metal bowl.

 **Step two**: I pour boiling water onto the chunks of curd in the bowl and let it sit for about a minute. (I always thought this was just to melt it all together

**Step three**: I work the curd with my hands for a little bit until it's starting to stick together a little better

**Step four**: I basically add morton salt onto the curd each time before I fold it; and I fold it enough times until it I'm confident that it's not going to fall apart when I try to stretch it. So I salt it/fold it around 4 or 5 times. (this surprisingly doesnt end up being too much salt)

**Step five:** Everywhere I've looked online shows people stretching the curd with a paddle or something. Not I. The way I was taught to stretch it is by grabbing the curd

~~From here, wrap them in saran wrap, blah blah blah.

Note: Pharmacies allegedly carry glukosesirup, vanilla extract, and baking powder, so I kinda *want* to do this.

I've been trying to get my Pho up to good big-city restaurant standards for half a year.  

Recently, but I'm not sure how authentic this technique is.  

Adding a couple of onions to the broth before boiling for hours, a friend insisted her Vietnamese mother never used onions.   Also she insisted on NOT using fish oil.

Also, adding a stir-fry before the broth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsSiA-JHm0U).  But even with the stir-fry technique, is it acceptable to use any hoisin in the stir fry?  I read elsewhere that the hoisin is only for dipping the meat in, and the broth is supposed to be perfect.

I've tried a half dozen different approaches, Vancouver Canada restaurant-level Pho.  My spice bag is usually star anise, cinnamon, cloves, coriander and all spice.  I usually simmer ox bones for 3 hours. I haven't tried shin bones yet, but I've been told they're better.  I'm happy with my rice noodles.

Man

Put salt and paprika on three thigh/leg combos (the biggest pan I have can only accommodate three) and put them in the pan with some olive oil.  

After browning

I deglazed the pan with some red wine vinegar, along with Trader Joe's 21 Seasoning Salute (man, that stuff's awesome).

Two weeks ago my wife and I were out shopping for a new knife block

We don't own a dishwasher so we wash everything by hand (we use generic brand Dawn-type dish soap). With knives we try to dry them as soon as we wash them so that water spots don't form on the blades.

Its forming not just on the face, but along the handle where the metal meets the rubber (I assume moisture is getting trapped between those two parts).

So what's going on with my knives? I'm rather annoyed that we spent so much money on these knives when they clearly are not ""no stain"" as described. Are we doing something wrong in washing them

For those that missed it



&gt;Why did she decide to sell fried chicken?

At the time my grandparents were poor and didn't know what to do for a living. My grandfather tried being a bus driver and my grandmother tried making confectionery, which became a big open-air restaurant.



&gt;How did she create the recipe?

She experimented in her own house. She tasted the competitors' fried chicken and guessed the seasonings and adjusted it to her own tastes. In her recipe is a secret ingredient not used by other restaurants (to her knowledge) purely through trial and error. When she first made the fried chicken

For further explanation



&gt;What chicken did she use?

We refer to the chickens as ""ayam kampung"", so no risk for spoilage.)



&gt;What are the details of the restaurant? Cost structure? Customers?

The restaurant was located near a main plaza(?), etc., things you would normally find in a mall. Naturally a ton of the shoppers looked for food, and, well, there is this one fried chicken joint nearby. 

The restaurant, such as weekends, the restaurant could sell up to 200 whole chickens. Back then people were less fussy about the ""undesirable"" parts, so chicken hearts, livers, intestines, heads, chicken butts sold so well they would often run out). When my grandma first started out

When I asked what her margins were



&gt;What did you learn about food after those years?

Quality is important. Back when she first started there were no big competitors, which made her lose many loyal customers.



&gt;When did you start cooking?

She didn't know how to cook until she married my grandfather. He complained incessantly about her cooking and admitted to breaking down in tears once. She felt like she worked her hardest to prepare food but her husband didn't appreciate it. So she learned cooking from her mother-in-law. 



&gt;What is essential in Indonesian cooking?

Fragrance is important in Indonesian cooking. We use lots of shallots and garlic

Indonesians love sweet flavors and sweet soy sauce is indispensable. Different brands have different flavor profiles. The restaurant has used the same locally produced soy sauce for decades--others just don't taste the same.

&gt;Recipe?

It appears to me that, quick recipes that bear no resemblance to actual Tabasco (no salt ferment, simmering, adding water, etc) or those that sound legit but appear to have not been tested by the author (""we think putting this in an old wine barrel would help"", mentioning a 6 month ferment but not how it tasted afterwards, etc).

Has anyone made a Tabasco-style sauce that includes a long salt fermentation

I will be taking several pounds of fresh red chillies of a few varieties (probably some combo of Birdseye, throw them in a plastic beer fermenter along with a liberal amount of salt and a handful of fresh wine oak chips/cubes, and then leave them for about 3-6 months. After tasting, I will strain via cheesecloth, combine 1 part pepper juice with 4 parts vinegar, and bottle.

Has anyone done anything like this

- one recipe I read said that for the entire duration of the ferment you should have the mix in a sterile fermenter with an airlock, will I need to do that?

- has anyone tried oaking a chilli sauce? I can't make out actual oak flavors in Tabasco but assume they must be part of the profile that sets it apart. I'm planning on using about double the chips that a winemaker would use for a well-oaked red

- any advice on chillies to use or stay away from? I know Tabascoes are juicier than most supermarket chillies

- any advice on vinegar to use? I'm planning on using plain white vinegar but may experiment with some other types like cider or red wine.

- With this type of ferment will my end product be approximately the heat of the original peppers

- any idea on salt qty that will both support the ferment and result in an end product that is about as salty as Tabasco (260 mg sodium / 17g)? Based on my numbers and a 1:4 dilution, which obviously I won't. I'm assuming I'll get 50% extraction which leads me to 0.344 cups of salt per kilo. Is that enough?

",8,31,http://www.reddit.com/r/AskCulinary/comments/17m8yz/anyone_else_fry_shrimp_shells/,"Awhile ago there was a post voicing some frustration that kitchens weren't removing the tail on a shrimp when the rest of the shell was already removed. It sparked a debate upon the merits of leaving the shell on entirely with separate camps preferring the presentation of shrimp with nothing to clean on the plate vs. the appealing taste that you lose when you strip the shell. 

I find myself in the middle

Last night I tried something different because I had some time on my hands. I was crisping some shallots to serve with the shrimps as a topping and I decided to throw the shells in with the shallots to try to get the toasted shell taste in with the topping. I stripped the shells and tails in large pieces to make them easy to pick out (instead of having to pick out tiny bits of stuff) and toasted them with the shallots and it turned out excellently. 

I could achieve a deeper toast on the shells than usual because I wasn't worried about overcooking the meat inside and the water content in the meat wasn't quenching the shells. I also rinsed the toasted shells in the extra shrimp meat marinade which I used to deglaze the pan after the meat was seared up nice to recover extra shrimpy goodness. I think a lot of the toasted taste from the shells might be from the little bits of meat in the legs we usually don't end up eating.

I'm at 5, so I decided to bake a cake. It was a little crumbly when it came out of the oven, but still servable.

When I was mixing that in, the whole thing separated and looked curdled and I realized I had over beaten it. Sigh. These things happen.

This morning I picked up some more heavy cream and set out to remake the ganache. I used a different brand of chocolate this time, but it held soft peaks and I was happy that it wasn't rock hard.

Here's the recipe, and creamy (but not thick!) with just a enough spiciness and goes well with the sweetness of the corn. A very good summer dish. Serve warm or cold. I didn't follow the recipe's measurements exactly, just made sure that the dressing tasted delicious and that it just **coated** the corn, not drowned it (the key was balancing the ratio of mayonnaise to lime juice). I also cut up and added some boneless, skinless chicken breasts to the mix; however, I cut the chunks too big and so the large chunks of chicken 'overwhelmed' the flavors and textures of the corn salad in that a lot of surface area of the chicken went to waste (i.e. they were to thick).

Seems some people are confused about what is Wagyu and such;

Wagyu is a breed of cattle that originated from Asian cattle being crossbred with European
and British cattle around 200 years ago
and america was given semen and embryos of Wagyu cattle from Japan to allow to cultivate their
own. America has cros bred this Wagyu breed with the famous Angus Cattles to create a 
US version to the famous Kobe Beef

Currently Australia cultivates the largest herd of Wagyu cattle outside of Japan and provides it to international markets.

The features of Wagyu beef is that is has more Marbeling - intramuscular fat (IMF) - &amp; softer fat

Later, grated and formed into a patty, or sliced thin and seasoned like sandwich meat.

I've had some people comment that it seems a little bit rubbery, which I think would increase that sensation.

I also have had seitan at a gourmet restaurant, both in Philadelphia.  The chefs there are able to make their seitan unbelievably meaty.

Vegetarian chinese restaurants also use seitan based products that are very soft and meat-like.  They almost seems stringy like real meat too.

So

I'm no chef, and others for baking.  I've found the baking recipes to be specific imitations of meat loafs, pork chops, etc.  I like the boiling method because it creates a versatile product that can be used similarly to a common cut of meat (chicken breast,  steak).

Today at work, the bubbles only get more prominent. So I came to the conclusion that is must be fermenting, and those bubbles are not air, but co2. Upon tasting, it has a yeasty undertone.

Now I know I got the peach glaze hot enough to kill any wild yeast on the peaches.

Basically I am wondering what could have caused this, and we do get a lot of produce in. My thinking is that there was some wild ambient yeast that landed in my glaze and started to ferment. This just seems unlikely though. Any thoughts? Does dead yeast reactivate under correct conditions, or did wild yeast in the air contaminate the glaze after cooking? Or am I totally wrong and there is no fermentation going on, and the bubbles are for some other reason? Thanks in advance!",,False,,False,t3_1jewv0

I typically do use a bouquet of herbs (bay leaf, etc.) I just didn't add that to my original recipe because it varies a lot with each batch, and I was looking more for advice on how to get the right color/clarity. But there's a lot of good ideas in here that I've never thought of before.

I was going to preheat my cast iron in the oven at 500 degrees, will I need to adjust my cooking temperature/time to make sure it cooks properly?  And if so, will that affect the quality of the finished product?  The bacon sounds enticing, but I don't want to ruin my steaks for it.",,False,,False,t3_18gkxc

1358965003.0,174uog,Is it silly/redundant to make a stock with certain ingredients and then to immediately turn it into a soup that calls for stock + most of those same ingredients?,turkeypants,38,6,8,"I just made my first ever stock, celery

But since my fledgling cooking repertoire doesn't yet include much that calls for stock, celery, and a bay leaf and a pinch of thyme. It seemed kind of silly and wasteful to chop up a bunch of the same stuff and in one case, simmer it for an hour and then toss that stuff out with the bones, and in the other case to simmer the same stuff for a while but keep it in there and eat it. 

I know stock doesn't have to be used for soup and so the veg/herb flavoring would help make a more flavorful stock for other applications, but those guys seemed to be in the minority.
