CNN is owned by Time Warner

Why does this matter so much? Well, and never mentions concern for its users' privacy. Then, that very same company, uses it's news division to shut down the story alltogether. I think it's time we get CNN talking about this again. 

* Live Shots on CNN with posters &amp; protesters where possible.

* Trending on Twitter with thousands of @CNN mentions including questions about their possible involvement
 
* Anything else you can think of. The options are really limitless.

This could bring a massive amount of attention to our cause. Not only to the people who watch CNN

What do you guys think?

**edit:** There are some upvotes here, and tweet @CNN as much as possible. This is most effective in high numbers. The key is to make it to where every time someone does a search for CNN, we are there. If you feel that this is good for #RestoreThe4th, be sure to include that too w/ lots of information on how more can join our movement. This movement can not be allowed to stall, and by taking to social media strong, we will have more people coming here to check things out!

African American's did it to raise awareness on civil rights issues and it was a huge success. How hard can it be to organize a fraction of a percentage of the people in this country into a voice that can't be quieted? Hong Kong, we can bring change to ours.

Edit: Didn't expect this to get so big. I need 5 Twitter names to follow to start this account. I'm not looking to promote any other ideas or politicians in any form. I've already started a GMail account and I'll work a FB account. /u/Hail_the_IT-Goddess has offered to help and I will probably need a  couple more. There was a gender issue brought up so I changed the name to Million Citizen March. On Twitter it's @MCMonDC And GMail: MCMonDC@GMail.com


Edit2: I've been reading a lot of the messages and thank you again for the support. I am in agreement that if you can't make it to DC, I wish to stay as far away from groups that can discredit ours. If you have any suggestions let me know. Until then, follow me @MCMonDC and let's try and get this to the front page. 


Edit3: Date will be important. If we want a million people it has to be after everyone returns from summer vacations. I've thought about it long and hard, I think the day itself and what it stands for and what we stand for will have a big impact as well. Hopefully using that in conjunction with the movement will get enough people out and on to the streets to make a difference. What do you guys think?

Let us not just show up
Wear your Sunday best - this is bigger than a job interview

The time to debate with those who fail to recognize the danger these programs represent is over. We must seek out our allies in this battle and unite. Those who oppose our cause have the option to march as well

This is not a rehearsal. It's not a game. We must not commit the mistakes of other well intentioned movements. When we march

Now is not the time to cast blame on those who may have been mislead

Now is not the time to promote one candidate over another

Do not promote fear among your ranks. Not even in jest. No jokes about Big Brother watching

Let's set a ~~Kickstarter~~ Indiegogo and buy this ad. Our neighbors don't all make use of Reddit. Let's do this as if it were our only chance.

**EDIT**: An ad in the Times will run us $50k. That's peanuts. If this community can raise nearly a million dollars for a bus driver

EDIT 2: u/davros_ brought it to my attention that this funding is allowed on **Indiegogo.com**

International contributions can be made through Indiegogo. We welcome the support of our friends from across the globe. You're being indiscriminately spied on as well. 

**EDIT 3:** I am currently setting up the link. It will be up shortly and you'll find it right below this edit.

I need someone with graphic skills to set up a logo we can use.

It then attempts to tabulate an intrusion score based on the number of bad and good votes each number has made.  A high intrusion score means a member has done more damage to our privacy

Some of these data were tabulated from a table [shared in this post](http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/1jkmjf/what_real_reform_of_the_nsa_looks_like_holts/cbfy1kn)

There are three tabs:

**Master List**:  This is the first tab

**Key**:  This is the second tab

**Priority Contacts**:  Right now, the more worthwhile the call should be.

---

**What To Do**:

**I.  Call the names on the priority contacts list.**  

The list is in the data file linked above

When you dial the number

""Hi

If you are not asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent

If you are a constituent

If you are asked for your zip code and you are not a constituent, where s/he is making decisions that affect me directly, and I'd like my message passed along though I am not a constituent.""

**II.  Call your own reps.**  [Here's the link to find their contact information.](http://www.usa.gov/Contact/Elected.shtml)  Use the data above to let them know you're familiar with their voting record and it will be influencing your vote.  Again



**III.  Reach out to friends and family and get them to call.**  

This is the second most important thing you can do.  Especially family that are in the districts of high priority contacts.  For every person you convince to call, quadrupling) your impact.

Every step you help them take increases the probability they will call.

Looking up their reps for them and sending them the phone numbers probably doubles the chances they'll call.

Explaining the situation

**IV.  Share this post or something like it.**

I don't care how you do this.  The spreadsheet is public domain.  This post is public domain (within whatever terms Reddit imposes in their agreement) as far as I'm concerned.  Copy it, Twitter, Carrier Pigeon, Pack Mule, etc.) so others can have access to it and will be encouraged to contact their friends and loved ones as well.

http://act.demandprogress.org/letter/nsa_amash/

Nathan White just made us aware of some huge news. Rep. Amash has put forward an amendment that would defund the NSA's surveillance program. The vote is set for wednesday. From the House Committee's website:

""Ends authority for the blanket collection of records under the Patriot Act. Bars the NSA and other agencies from using Section 215 of the Patriot Act to collect records

Guys, family, and enemies. Encourage everyone to call their representatives. It's exciting to think that we could finally put an end to the NSA's spying. But as Nathan said, it's more than that. If we don't get a good showing on this vote, it will make it a lot harder to get congress to take us seriously in the future.

And to that point, and we have to be involved in changing that.

1371140706.0,1g9xyg,A guide to the arguments against NSA surveillance,capnrefsmmat,799,94,83,"It may be useful for everyone to have a curated list of common arguments and counter-arguments. Pleading for the Fourth amendment is satisfying but not terribly convincing to people who already believe surveillance is the right thing to do. So

**""I have nothing to hide!"" is irrelevant.**

* [Privacy isn't about having nothing to hide](https://chronicle.com/article/Why-Privacy-Matters-Even-if/127461/)! Surveillance grants the government a great deal of power to make decisions about you, or [the original paper](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=998565); I cannot summarize it in a single bullet point.)
* [We should all have something to hide](http://www.wired.com/opinion/2013/06/why-i-have-nothing-to-hide-is-the-wrong-way-to-think-about-surveillance/). The civil rights movement, but so is the ability to try new and socially-unacceptable things.
* You do have something to hide. The United States Code is so vast and complicated that you probably commit [several felonies a day](http://kottke.org/13/06/you-commit-three-felonies-a-day). (Please don't use the inevitable argument ""If you have nothing to hide
* If the government erroneously believes you *do* have nothing to hide
* If the government chooses to use its surveillance against you
* Even if the government does not attempt to attack *you* using surveillance data

**Oversight-free surveillance isn't necessary for national security.**

* The problem isn't surveillance -- it's surveillance without adequate oversight and targeting. National security could be preserved by a program which also respects our civil rights. The Fourth Amendment does not ban surveillance. It bans surveillance without judicial oversight and clear limits. An order to collect *all* phone records clearly violates this.
* Terrorism isn't as vast a threat as it's made out to be. [You're just as likely to be killed by a deer](http://www.cato.org/publications/commentary/blind-terror-dumb-state) as by Al-Qaeda. [Food poisoning
* Any large data-mining program is [statistically bound to be overwhelmed by false positives](http://bayesianbiologist.com/2013/06/06/how-likely-is-the-nsa-prism-program-to-catch-a-terrorist/) which consume government time and resources and mean most people marked as ""probably a terrorist"" and put under more extensive surveillance will likely be innocent.
* Is there really evidence that this surveillance preserves our national security? So far
* The NSA could save more lives by using pervasive surveillance to mail tickets to people who text and drive.

**Metadata invades your privacy.**

Metadata is probably more invasive than most searches that require a warrant. You could not obtain most of this information by strip-searching me:

* From your choice of friends
* Your cell phone records reveal your place of work, and presumably your favorite restaurants and spots for romantic flings.
* Your cell phone location records are unique
* Your credit card purchase history (which [is also collected by the NSA](http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424127887324299104578529112289298922.html)) can be mined to reveal all sorts of details about you

Targeting people based on metadata

It is also important to note that while the phone surveillance program only collects metadata, photos, and so on. This is supposed to be done with a warrant from the FISA court.

**Revealing surveillance programs doesn't harm national security.**

* Oh no, we have already disrupted their plans.
* No terrorist will realize ""the government is on to us!"" after reading that the government is watching everyone. It's equivalent to thinking the government is watching no one.
* The continued secrecy of programs which violate our rights harms our security -- security from the abuses of our government. Consider the case of [Joseph Nacchio](https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2007/10/qwest-ceo-nsa-punished-qwest-refusing-participate-illegal-surveillance-pre-9-11).

**The government has a history of abusing surveillance.**

* [HTLINGUAL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTLINGUAL) was a CIA project to illegally read mail sent to the Soviet Union and China from 1952-1973.
* [COINTELPRO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO) was the FBI's effort to put political advocacy groups, various women's rights groups, and anti-Vietnam War groups, under surveillance so they could be disrupted or stopped. Hoover ordered the FBI to ""expose, disrupt, misdirect, discredit,_Jr.#The_FBI_and_King.27s_personal_life) MLK. Several [people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Hampton) were killed by the FBI and police agencies.
* See also [Operation CHAOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_CHAOS).

Not too long ago I took part in an online messaging effort to express my concerns about the NSA's ever-reaching eyes and ears. Recently, and FISA is keeping the surveillance in check. Unfortunately, these things make me even more unsettled. You see, the 4th Amendment reads: ""The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, shall not be violated, and particularly describing the place to be searched, which a phone bill (or similar document/information) should be protected from the governments prying eyes without a warrant.

So now, we have the NSA violating the 4th Amendment. However, it doesn't stop there. We have a government that has passed laws allowing for the violation of the 4th Amendment. We have a congress that has repeatedly approved, with a strong majority, the violation of the 4th Amendment. On top of all of this, we have the FISA court that is supposed to be a check and balance, but in reality is a kangaroo court that never says ""no"" to the NSA and has zero transparency.

You claim that you work ""hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights"". Yet you continue to support these policies and activities that violate the very same Constitution and Americans' privacy rights.

You claim that taking away these constitutional rights has and will continue to save lives. However, come now, we're already violating the 6th and 8th amendments with Gitmo.)
You see
America isn't supposed to be the land of the safe. America is supposed to be the land of the free. Its founders knew a line had to be drawn somewhere. A line that said to the government ""you only have the authority to go this far."" That line is the Constitution. Our Federal government

Do you want to do something about it

There is something you can do! There is something we can ALL do. We can put people into government that represent OUR interests. We can vote out the officials which do not care at all about us

That is where the ""tea party"" movement succeeded, but we need to have clear and concise demands, goals, and a plan to achieve them.

If you agree with these demands

1. By exercising our right to vote and peaceful protest, simply removal from office. They have betrayed their oath to protect and defend the constitution, and must be removed.

2. Repeal the patriot act and other similar laws. If our currently elected representatives will not do so (highly unlikely)

3. The implementation of a transparent government which respects the fourth amendment and represents the interests of the people of the United States of America.

How?

1. We must organize

2. Tell people about this! Spread the word. The larger we become

3. Contribute. Everyone can contribute whether by helping to spread awareness

Do not worry yourself that most people in this country are complacent and do not care. The good news is

There are many who are ready to act now. There are many more who are sitting on the fence and would be willing to act but are waiting to see others step up to the plate first. If you start

The good news is, managing a subreddit of 12,000 members is no easy task! Further, as happens to any community that grows to this size, especially a political community, there will be trolls and troublemakers. Unfortunately, it is simply not possible for myself and our small team of moderators to properly deal with all of that while at the same time working with event organizers.

Therefore

----

**Proposed Policy Changes:**

1. No posts (comments are fine. everyone is entitled to their own personal opinion) which are not directly relevant to this movement. That means no Anti-Obama, no Anti-Libertarian, etc. Nothing that could be seen as polarizing, or that could create the false impression that this subreddit is politically leaning in any particular direction. There are plenty of other subreddits that can be used for that purpose.

2. Do not make posts which are unnecessary and push down legitimate posts. This isn't about getting internet points. If there is a post made about a particular organizer trying to get support, there will be a LOT of posts related to specific upcoming events in different areas, and it is very important that everyone is able to see them. 

Remember: There are people who are trying to derail this, one goal. All of us who are dedicated to this must do our best to see that this is done correctly.

We cannot afford for that to happen again.  Here's a list of some ways we can improve the next protest

**1) Dress to impress.**

[Here](http://media-1.web.britannica.com/eb-media/46/7546-004-7F54297C.jpg) is a picture of some of the dapper Civil Rights Protesters you'd see in the 60s.

You may want to bring your bongos and face paint to express your values and how you feel inside.  There's nothing wrong with that, and no one whose opinion you are trying to SWAY will take you seriously looking that way.

As a redditor once said

**EDIT:** Yes, no pot-smoking, no face paint, no masks, no looking different. We all need to look extremely average, but well-dressed IMO. - (/u/checkboxes)

*If you don't have a suit

**2) No violence

As activist Blase Bonpane says

For more explanation, Iraq war veteran and peace activist Captain Paul K. Chappell.  Everyone *needs* to read this article before attending or planning any protests.

&gt;Assume you are being watched. Do NOTHING to support violence
Regardless of how you feel
We cannot be seen to support or consider ANY violent action.

-(/u/animusvoxx)

**3) Don't get mad

One of the biggest problems of OWS was alienating people that should've been on board with our ideas, friends and neighbors why this is so important to our national security.  Talk about how passionately you care about our Constitution.  Say why you believe the actions of the current (and previous) administration go against what our founding fathers, and all veterans - past and present - have fought for.

You catch more flies with honey - act and speak in a way that will create allies.  We need to organize and stand strong together

**4) Have a plan.**

Saying you are upset or that shit is fucked up is not enough.  What do we want?

**EDIT:** 

*""Stop spying on us.""* - (/u/naphini)

Repealment of the PATRIOT act, upholding the 4th amendment and declaring the unalienable right of the people to be secure in their privacy from any government who wishes to infringe upon that liberty, and repeal and call unconstitutional any law in opposition of those freedoms. (edit suggested by /u/Legionof1)

&gt;We hold these truths to be self-evident, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form

 - 1) The entire Patriot Act isn't bad.. But Section 215 definitely needs to go (read up on it
 - 2) Shut down PRISM
 - 3) Shut down Boundless Informant
 - 4) Section 206 of the Patriot Act
 - 5) And FISA (wait.. that's Section 215
 - 6) Oh hell

**5*) Stay focused** (added by /u/Liberty4theStates)

As a community stay focused on the privacy issue

The dilution and hijacking of Occupy's initial focus on financial reform and money in politics a significant drag on its effectiveness.

Maybe efforts like this really can be done without organized leadership, I'd imagine there has to be an early agreement and widespread understanding in the community that laser-focus on the original issue is crucial and needs to be enforced by the group in general every day to avoid drift and ultimate failure.

**6*) No Us vs. Them

&gt;if I wanted to destroy the Occupy Movement the first thing I would do is encourage people in the movement to have an “us versus them” mentality. The government is notorious for planting undercover agents in social movements who intend to destroy the movement from within, and police officers as evil. Occupy Movement protests in many cities have had signs with the words, “Eat the rich” (which is a message that endorses violence), and during the Occupy Oakland protest a picture was taken of an activist holding a sign, “All my heroes kill cops.” If a government agent wasn’t behind that sign, then a protestor was doing the government’s work for free.""

-Cpt. Paul K. Chappell

**7*) Branding the movement** (/u/Legionof1)

Do not brand this tea party or OWS, we do not want to be a offshoot of the OWS or we will be mocked as 20 year olds who do not want to pay their college tuition. This is a bipartisan, non religious protest. We are after the true and full restoration of our rights to 4th amendment liberty.

**8*) Learn how to negotiate** (/u/philosophyisenergy)

Practice with each other in your group on scenarios like salary negotion etc to get better before going live. Learn about concepts such As ""best alternative to a negotiated agreement"", when to reveal information and others. [This book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/0073381209/ref=redir_mdp_mobile) is excellent.

Also read [machiavelli's the prince](http://www.gutenberg.org/files/1232/1232-h/1232-h.htm) to learn all the dirty tricks that will be played on you and be prepared. Watch the movie ""revolver"" to learn how your ego will get you in trouble and how to get past it. Learn active meditation to keep from losing your cool - Always be the most confident and calm person in the room. Fear nothing and let nothing get under your skin. If something makes you sweat or feel anxiety you lose. Channel that anxiety into will to power

**9*) Stay legal.**

Get permits and protest legally. That is something that caused the ""Occupy"" movement a lot of problems. - (/u/timetoact2013)

**10*) Organize and Elect.** 

&gt;Work as a community to support candidates that are against these surveillance programs for the 2014 midterm elections and hold them accountable. If a Democrat or a Republican will not do this, Libertarian or of another party.
- (/u/FireKnightV)

Most importantly, meaning we need to let them them know clearly that we will NOT vote for them if they do not support these initiatives, which means how *they* vote on these initiatives, not empty promises. - (edit suggested by /u/VyseofArcadia)

1373818469.0,1ia4o1,All of the great social movements of our time owe their success largely in part to social media. So today I am proposing a HUGE twitter blitz.,aeristh,463,97,92,"**How many of you guys liking this are actually tweeting?**

**tl;dr** Tweet up to 200 hundred tweets on the most popular tweets relating to us using our official hashtag #restorethe4th and our logo on your profile http://imgur.com/Co9xFpV IT REALLY IS ESSENTIAL. Please we need your help. Happy tweeting.

**Tweets you can use:**
""Stop #nsa spying and #restorethe4th amendment. restorethefourth.net""

""Don't let #Snowden's sacrifice go to waste.""

""End #nsa spying and #restorethe4th restorethefourth.net""

I know people don't take twitter seriously. But it's the perfect way to get the word out. You can message anyone

**Guidelines**
Here are some tips to get you started.

1. The way you do this is you get our logo http://imgur.com/Co9xFpV and you put it on the picture of your account so people know you're with us and they see what this is. 

2. You make a tweet that is short and uses our official hashtag #restorethe4th. Tell people what we do or a short to the point thing like ""end #nsa spying"" and then you send them to our website restorethefourth.net so they can find a local rally and get some info.

3. Go to the search bar and type in a related hashtag. The most popular ones are #nsa and #snowden you will see all the tweets that are the most popular and you gotta reply to those because more people will see them.

4. Don't care about who you're tweeting you have to reply to the most popular ones even if it isn't a person's account but msnbc's or kim kardashians. Your target with the largest accounts isn't the accounts themselves

5. Use hashtags in your tweet. #nsa is the most popular one. But you also should use our hashtag and any hashtag that is popular. You can see the trending hashtags on the left side midway through the page. That way more people see them cause they search what's trending.

6. There is a spam filter on twitter. Its a little complicated but I've got it down. You should only add about a 100 a day and 200 tweets per day. They say the limit is 500 but if they're not spaced out during the day

7. Put RT: or RTWT: At the beginning of your tweet that tells people you want what you're saying spread around. It sounds dumb but it WORKS


**Steps**

1. Set up an account or use an old one. This entails supplying an email you haven't used there if the account is new and putting our logo http://imgur.com/Co9xFpV on the account.

2. Search for related subjects like #NSA #snowden in the search bar and in the list of tweets reply to as many possible

""Stop #nsa spying and #restorethe4th amendment. restorethefourth.net""

""Don't let #Snowden's sacrifice go to waste. End #nsa spying and #restorethe4th restorethefourth.net""

Feel free to post good tweets and have others use them. **The Tweets must have restorethefourth.net and #restorethefourth in them** because that way people know who we are and more people here about us through the spread of our hashtag.

**Don't care who you tweet. Nobody is off limits. The most success I've had has come from accounts that were famous

**DONT SPAM**
https://blog.twitter.com/2010/state-twitter-spam
That is twitter's definition of spam. Learn those like your bible and make sure that you never go beyond those limits. ;)

2. If you really care about the movement, then recognize why there is a need to make sure we do this RIGHT. That means legally, peacefully, and lawfully. 

3. I personally care for the safety of anyone who attends protests that are planned through this movement. Therefore, to have a positive and enjoyable experience -- not end up hurt because of some violent idiot.

4. The only way this is going to grow to sufficient numbers that we can actually see our goals come to fruition is if people can see that this is a peaceful movement. If someone sees talk of violence

Being a web developer I started working on a page to organize it, and I chose December 15th, because it was Bill of Rights Day. Trevor Lyman, who had organized the first money bomb on November 5th, made our web pages

Some people really got in to it, this discussion between me and Trevor Lyman, is where the Tea Party got its moniker from. Him and me were never very pivotal to that movement itself, but we by happenstance gave it its name.

I told you this story for one very important reason: **you don't have to do anything except show up to change the course of history. That is literally it.**

I was also the PR Director for Occupy Portland (the OWS protest in Portland, many times.

But this time

This protest must take place on the Fourth. It will not succeed otherwise

**The Police**

The police only know one way to respond to protests, that's their job, and protests are definitely disruptions of the status quo.

*If* this protest takes place on the Fourth, it will not be seen as legitimate. The reason for that is...

**Symbolism**

Do not discount the value of this. You protesting *for* your Fourth Amendment rights

That kind of symbolism will break through the lethargic apathy that most people feel. It's the exact kind of jingoistic thing people are trained to respond to up through high school

Further

**Juxtaposition**

The very fact that you will be using the almost programmed patriotism of the populace to turn people *against* the governments actions will be *very* difficult for the average person to ignore. The message can be summed in to a single sound-byte that will create cognitive dissonance inside people's minds. 

Unlike things that are simply unpleasant

The fact that we are supposed to feel pride on the 4th will be juxtaposed with the reality of what our government is doing to us

It will be very uncomfortable

**Time**

There is enough time between now and then for everyone to really make things happen and think ahead. Organize medics

But before the actual protest, I'm going to protest that NSA thing. You heard about that, right? Where they're recording all our conversations and emails and crap? Well anyway, that's pretty fucked up, and I can't think of anything that's more like the real Fourth of July than protesting *that* kind of thing. Should be pretty fun actually.""

It also gives time to organize things like food or drink or music or entertainment. If you have those things, don't ask people to do it without some truly ""4th of July"" food and drink. No alcohol, ever. But hotdogs, lemonade, etc.

**Media**

You cannot even fathom how much the media will love this story. You will get the most favorable media coverage you can possible hope for if this happens on the fourth. Trust me, the local media, the national media. If you want to be treated fairly, or fuck it, if you want to have an advantage, the Fourth is your best bet.

---

So here's your checklist:

- Have structure of organization *before* the protest. (Make it transparent with meeting notes and minutes if possible.)
- Have an established structure to disseminate real-time instruction to any size of crowd.
- Plan and prepare people for the police using military tactics.
- Do not record the exact sequence or plan of events in any digital format. If possible
- Prepare to care for common protesting injuries: tear gas, broken bones, gashes and scratches, etc. (What, you just woke up to what's been going on? Did you think this would be easy? If you want them to stop, you will have to take your lumps, there's already too much corruption for us to pretend someone
- Prepare events, and have contingency plans if too many people show up. Do not have everyone doing the same thing for more than 15 minutes if possible... change up what's going on often enough to keep people engaged and enraged.
- Create a way to track and support anyone who is arrested. If possible
- Make sure EVERY SINGLE GODDAMN PERSON knows this: ""If you are stopped by an officer, I will not say anything else, and I want to see a lawyer'. Invoke your 4th, 5th and 6th amendment rights all at once, and then DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES SAY ANOTHER SOLITARY WORD until you are either released or you see a lawyer."" The police are legally allowed to lie to you, even when questioning or detaining. They can and will tell you something is illegal even if it isn't. Do not say ANYTHING at all, other than the exact phrase above.
- Cameras. Lots of cameras.
- Make sure that it should be *fun* for the people involved, but plan for the best).
- Be prepared to deal with a lot of [apathy](http://www.reddit.com/r/Ask_Politics/comments/14n14m/what_can_be_done_about_voter_apathy_and_why_isnt/c7emvxk)

1371153391.0,1gafsc,"An open letter to Congress from ""Restore the Fourth"". This is being sent to news media outlets across the country.",timetoact2013,338,49,77,"**To: the Representatives and Senators of the 113th Congress and the President of the United States**

We are Restore the Fourth: a coalition of citizens from across the political spectrum. We aim to restore the Fourth Amendment to its intended purpose: ""protect[ing] the right of the people to be secure in their persons, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures"". The American people have a steadfast expectation of privacy for their personal communications, electronic and otherwise. That expectation is more than reasonable, it is self-evident.

As the courts have made clear, and other communications are protected by the Fourth Amendment. These rights have suffered systematic violations over the last 12 years and in response we have prepared a list of goals outlining our mission. Additionally, we have drafted a list of actions that we insist must be taken in order to remedy these violations and restore the fundamental Fourth Amendment rights of the American people.

**Restore the Fourth seeks to:**

#1. Raise public awareness of the unconstitutional surveillance methods employed by the United States government.

The American people have a right to know the actions of their government. Accountability is the foundation of democracy

#2. Ensure that the scope of government surveillance is constitutional, and strictly enforced.

Surveillance activities must be conducted within the legal bounds defined by the Constitution and US law. In order to effectively defend the rights of the people

#3. Establish a clear and transparent system of accountability for the United States' intelligence community.

A clear system of accountability is required in order to properly enforce restrictions on surveillance activities. This system must be open and visible to the American people in order to ensure that proper protocols are followed.

**Restore the Fourth demands that the U.S. government:**

#1. Conduct a congressional hearing and a criminal investigation into the extent and constitutionality of domestic government surveillance programs.

A full investigation must be conducted to determine the scale and legality of the actions taken by the US intelligence community. This must include revealing the scope and duration of surveillance programs

#2. Reform the USA PATRIOT Act

Many legislative actions taken since 9/11 have allowed an expansion of government surveillance powers in the name of safety and security. It is vital that these powers be reined in to stay within the boundaries outlined by the Constitution.

#3. Take a federal stance against law-enforcement practices across the nation which also violate our physical security and privacy

The PRISM program that has recently come to light is one of many slowly expanding violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans. The safety and privacy of our persons must also be ensured.

#4. Hold those involved in government surveillance programs accountable to stringent and transparent judicial oversight.

Accountability is paramount to ensure such violations do not happen in the future. Those responsible for violating the Constitution must be brought to light and their conduct reviewed by a duly appointed judge to determine the legality of their behavior.

#5. Remove James Clapper from his position as Director of National Intelligence.

Director James Clapper gave misleading or false testimony before the Congress in response to inquiries by Senator Ron Wyden in a March 12, a full investigation must be conducted into Mr. Clapper's knowledge and testimony, as well as the legality of his actions.

We will hold demonstrations nationwide on July 4th

The power of a government should exist to reflect the will of its people. We, we will act swiftly to replace them. We urge you to act on these requests in order to end the violation of our rights and liberties, and to uphold the Constitution as you swore to do when you took office:

    ""I do solemnly swear that I will support the Constitution of the United States.""
    -Congressional Oath of Office

Awaiting Your Action

Essentially the narrative was to discredit Snowden by highlighting the fact that he was a ""high school drop out"" and ""Left the army"" and was simply an ""I.T. Guy"" and had no real authority at NSA.

Volekey actually stated that he thought the real problem here was using outside contractors and not government workers at NSA.

You can change the wording



**BE PREPARED WITH THESE TYPES OF ANSWERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT GET....**

* It's not about Edward Snowden

* I think a lot of people have forgotten their history. The reason everyone is celebrating today is because July 4th marks our independence and declaration as a sovereign nation. I think more important than getting drunk is changing history


&gt;It's not a matter of legality; I fully believe that these programs are 100% illegal, and that is a problem. The American government should be ashamed of breaking the supreme rule of the land in such a grievous way.


* Privacy is a huge issue


&gt;We've already seen that the so called ""detriment to our country"" they claim these leaks have caused, for example, who we call an alley has publicly denounced this behavior as unacceptable. Ironic when you consider on the 18th they were the main example of other alley countries that ""do it too"". Even if it was true, and I really doubt it's anywhere near this scale, it doesn't make it right.


* The 4th amendment in spirit was designed explicitly to prevent these types of programs. 

((( The reddit admins used this :-3 )))


&gt;We live in a world where technology has become more efficient than human analysis


* We have, and in fact the Deputy director of the FBI was caught red handed (airquotes) ""misspeaking"" about the main 'Wall Street attacks' he mentioned to Congress on the 18th. It turns out the jury didn't convict at all, because there was no trial...just another case of the FBI busting it's own sting plots as propaganda fuel. 


&gt;These programs cost the tax payers untold amounts of money, only they classify the budget.


* **Secret laws and secret interpretations of those laws

 ((( :D this is the blog quote (well it should be this is the FIXED and updated version....!! how sweet is that! )))

&gt;PRISM really isn't the focus here, Ragtime, Thinthread, Trailblazer, Total Informational Awareness, Boundless Informant and several other seemingly meaningless spook words dating back all the way to 1945 Operation Shamrock, but it's all meaningless unless people start to understand why we're opposed to the problem as opposed to just giving a random name to the problem itself.


* We're not related to occupy and we're unrelated to {insert whatever}. We are an extremely separate group of concerned American citizens


&gt;I don't think most people understand the true scope of what's going on. This isn't a simple case of illegal wiretaps or subversive pseudo subpoenas with gag-orders. They are quite literally analyzing every bit of data ever sent. Very little can be done to stop it because the means they use are so hihgly technical. They're not eating from the mouth of the river


* It's not that we feel like they're spying on us directly

&gt;Encrypting your data is a good first step


* The only way to cut through the darkness of secrecy is by casting light. Edward Snowden gave us the puzzle pieces, outsourcing to contractors, and hiding it deeper precludes the cut budget and scrapped program.


&gt;I don't believe any one person caused this


* They have


&gt;We are a completely nonviolent coalition. Anyone who says otherwise has either hijacked our platform for their own selfish ends


* Personally, everything his campaign ran on was abolished as soon as he took office and in fact, he's expanded it at a quicker rate than Bush did in his second term. 


&gt;It's not that they're looking directly at what we say, but 50 years from now I don't want 2 terabyte hard drives of what I've written in a database, regardless of the context. 

* People, literally. 


&gt;No, those claims were made without a shred of proof using fabricated documents and probably never happened...I don't believe there will ever be any direct retaliation because they don't take us seriously. Well they should. My words are extremely serious, and just because they've hidden away so well doesn't mean they're above reproach. Just because they've bent the law doesn't put them above it and one day soon, I believe these laws will snap. In fact, I believe that day is coming extremely soon.


* Think of this issue like a slow creeping mold or corrosive rust undermining our democracy. It took years to creep up and now some are saying that it's too late. I think we're infested

&gt;Yes


* It's possible our words will go unheard sure


&gt;I think writing congress is important


* The FBI is involved as well. Everyone is. We've allowed them to scare us into submission and freight trained broken legislation through Congress without a contingency. Even Congress has publicly stated FISA and Patriot are out of hand.


&gt;They've hidden themselves away


* Under George W. Bush


&gt;Personally, corruption, fraud, waste, abuse under the color and cover of law...and as Thomas Drake says, when the color and cover of law isn't good enough, they simple make up the rules.


* Regardless of what these companies say, but at least it took steps to fight National Security Letters in 2012 to the point where in 2013 a judge ruled them unconstitutional. That's right. One of the main tools being used by the FBI and NSA WAS RULED UNCONSTITUTIONAL BY A CALIFORNIA JUDGE. Pressuring these companies via their wallets is a great way to make a statement.


&gt;No, quite literally more than a decade in the making. It's not something that's just going to go away because I'm here speaking today, but I hope through my words others can start to listen and really take notice of the issues involved.

* The older generation doesn't have to support this, based simply on age. Do I sound naive, uninformed or inarticulate?  Do I sound like a traitor to my country?



&gt;Sure, the former NSA whistleblowers can give you the best comprehensive break down of the message we're trying to send...specifically look at Drake's speech at the National Press Club on March 18th of 2013.

Dear [eternalexodus]
 
Thank you for contacting me regarding the National Security Agency's (NSA) surveillance programs and the reports of wide-scale collection of Americans' phone records.  I appreciate that you took the time to express your thoughts about this very troubling issue.

Please know that I share your concerns over the recent disclosures related to the NSA's vast collection of Americans' phone records.  These disclosures have highlighted the significant gap between the government's interpretation of the PATRIOT Act and the public's understanding of it - a point that I have repeatedly raised.  Furthermore, I believe that while we must protect our national security, we cannot lose sight of our constitutional liberties.  I have warned about this type of overreach for years, and I will continue to lead the charge to protect the communications of law-abiding Americans from indiscriminate collection and surveillance.

As part of my effort to establish greater transparency of the government's surveillance policies, I have urged the NSA to disclose any evidence indicating that the bulk phone records collection program has provided intelligence that would not be otherwise obtainable.

I pledge to continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to restore Americans' faith in their government by pushing for the right balance between ensuring our national security and protecting Americans' constitutional rights.  As always
I will continue to listen closely to what you and other Coloradans have to say about matters before Congress, but also about bridging the divide that has paralyzed our nation's politics.  For more information about my positions and to learn how my office can assist you, please visit my website at www.markudall.senate.gov.
 
Warm regards

Mark Udall
U.S. Senator

I'm proud to live in a state with a powerful Senator taking such an admirable position; Udall serves on the Committee on Armed Services

1370822517.0,1g0fsd,Some thoughts and opinions from someone with a Masters in Political Science.,Restore1212,178,31,45,"Hi, so bear with me if there are any typos/grammar mistakes...posting on a phone is kinda hard. Yesterday it seemed like this movement was headed towards a flopping

First

1. Know your goals and keep them as short and as simple as possible. Our goal here is pretty clear; we Americans demand the privacy we are entitled to. This is very important. The main reason the Occupy movement flopped is due to have too many goals and each demographic had different ideas on what that could be. For this movement

2. Avoid buzz words and overly 'technical' words - I cannot tell you how many fence sitters or voters who are trying to educate themselves will completely shut themselves off to your movement if you make things sound complicated. Instead of saying 'repeal', you should use it, especially in politics.

3. Keep your mission statement short and simple. Not only will this help inform people who don't know what your movement is all about, you are going to want this once the media starts interviewing random members. They are going to try to pick out the dumbest of the dumb, so if you keep things easy to remember, you have a less chance of that happening. Looking over on the side bar, I personally think as it is on Reddit, it is okay, but saying that in person is a mouth full and not too easy to remember.

Perhaps changing it to something  like this (please note these are rough ideas and ONLY meant to be an example on how to keep things short and simple and I am not suggesting we use these! I'm not an English major

 - We demand anyone involved with NSA removed from office immediately
 - Remove the Patriot Act and other laws or we will vote for someone else who will
 - We demand the transparent Government that represents the American people

I know these are terrible

4. If you're going to use posters/icons for this movement (which you should, not everyone knows what that movie was about, and thanks to the media, anything with that mask or anything like it is assumed to be an evil hax0or. I have no idea what your icon/posters/symbols should be as designing is not something I'm good at, but try to keep it something all demographics can get behind AND understand. I remember seeing a poster of Obama taking off his face to reveal Bush behind the mask, something like that is something everyone would understand (Obama is no different than Bush) and it gets the message across.

5. Look for arguments that are going to be brought against you and prepare a counter attack. This is important because you don't want to be caught off guard if someone throws a question at you

- If you have nothing to hide
- It's for our protection against criminals
- It only affects other countries.
- Who cares

This job is again suited for someone better at English and with a working computer... I personally have been using the ol 'If you have nothing to hide

6. You guys picked a great name for this movement and a great time to protest as well. Restore the Fourth is easy to remember and sounds like a jingle, how can they? If you dress like normal and keep your posters hidden until time to act, they aren't going to be able to tell you apart from the regular people who are just there to party. Unless they plan on arresting everyone, protesting on the fourth is a brilliant plan and you guys should definitely discuss in open what you're planning on doing, cause by the time they find out who is there to party and who is there to protest, it will be too late. That being said...

7. Dress nice, I know you shouldn't have to, but the sad reality is that the media is going to try and show the worst of the bunch and yes, people, especially older people, are going to judge you by how you look. Wearing a bunch of V for Vendetta masks and having offensive posters isn't going to convince people this is a serious issue, it's just going to make them think a bunch of kids are being loud and annoying. It is a very common tactic for the media and government to make any movement out to be the bad guy

8. Don't get violent or rude. NEVER BE RUDE! Even if someone is being rude to you, and if they don't, distance yourself from them right away and depending on the context, publicly state that you and your group do NOT believe what that person did. You are very likely going to get people in the group who try to ruin your image for shits and giggles or worse, because someone is trying to destroy the movement from the inside. 

9. There is a chance you might get arrested or even abused by the cops. This is easier said than done, yet they just sat there and took it, so when the pictures came out, people were more sympathetic towards them then the ones screaming at them.

10. Know your rights. Lots of cops will try to screw you over and they can do this easily because most aren't aware of there rights. I can't find the link on my phone right now, and I CANNOT stress this enough, LEARN THEM! **if you take nothing else from this, if you get arrested, DO NOT TALK TO THE COPS. ASK FOR AN ATTORNEY AND KEEP YOUR MOUTH SHUT!**

 Edit:// here's the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4nQ_mFJV4I

 Edit 2 // here's another video


11. This next part is not meant to scare anyone or start anything, could very well be informants. Let's not forget the mod of the main Occupy subreddit was an FBI informant. That being said, as long as you don't say or plan to do anything illegal, you will be okay. 

12. CALL AND WRITE YOUR OFFICIALS! Do not listen to Reddit, but they still get passed on along to the person you are writing to, and they do take note of it. I've worked as an intern, getting a few phone calls about an issue you care about is a great way to get our attention and take the issue seriously. Since hardly anyone ever calls or writes, just a few of those can change a law or improve something, just think of how much you can get done if you gather everyone around and plan to devote a small amount of time to calling/writing.  

I have other stuff I wanted to say but my damn phone is about to die and I have to go out to my car to charge it... sorry for this.

Thank you for contacting me regarding the revelations of the National Security Agency's (NSA) intelligence collection programs.  I appreciate your taking the time to share your thoughts with me.  As an Army veteran and Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence

I was shocked by the claims of Edward Snowden.  Mr. Snowden not only stole American secrets and put our soldiers and sailors at risk through his treasonous actions

Let's get to the facts:

· No NSA program listens to the phone calls or tracks the content of the calls of American citizens or persons who are in the United States;

· No NSA program sees the contents of emails

· There is no ""Big Data"" storage of all of the contents of every communication of American citizens;

· The data collected on U.S. calls—entirely authorized by Congress and approved by the federal courts—is anonymous and limited to the date and time of the call and the phone numbers themselves.  There is no location information, a call was made.

I, but also consistent with the critical mission of defeating radical Islamic terrorism.  In fact, all three branches of government created by the Constitution continue to have oversight of, input into, and responsibility for the creation and execution of these programs.

As a veteran, I take the balance between privacy and protecting American lives very seriously.  These anti-terror programs are crucial.  The government's interest in carrying out these programs is the most compelling imaginable: defending against terrorist attacks that could take countless innocent lives here in the United States and protecting our servicemen serving abroad. 

Eliminating these programs would return us to a pre-9/11 security posture that would make this country less safe.  A majority of Americans agree, and fear-mongering of the past few weeks are replaced with accurate information.

We cannot abandon the battlefield in the War on Terror any more than we can abandon other battlefields—too many lives are at risk.  These programs work.  In fact

If you have any additional concerns

Sincerely

The cool thing about a phone number is you can use it anywhere: in an image, a billboard, a radio ad, on stage at an event, etc.  It let's you turn anyone in earshot into another activist.  Our hope is that folks on /r/restorethefourth can use it everywhere, especially in flyers and images for sharing.

The arguments of both sides of this debate have merit. Both sides will have to swallow their pride

The issue of branding: National owns RT4. That is an indisputable fact. They allow Local Organizations to operate under their brand. Expecting them to relinquish their brainchild to anyone and everyone to do as they please is foolish. They have both a right and a responsibility to manage how their brand is utilized.

On Local Autonomy: Local organizers have done, far too much time and momentum have been squandered. Expecting them to accept ""oversight"" is frankly, horseshit. The idea of having political officers embedded with local organizations to ensure they toe the party line is patently offensive. Perhaps having regional liasons to facilitate communication between National and Local would be a good middle of the road solution.

On Credentials: I've noticed several people highlighting this issue of ""credentials"". I know many well educated people who I wouldn't trust to watch a pot boil. Credentials can be achieved through diligence in the absence of competence. Lets put this issue to rest. How did National earn its credentials? By action, they earned it the same way Local Organizers did. By stepping forward and filling the void. By devoting time and energy towards creation. The solution? We accept the leadership we have and schedule a vote on Local and National leadership for Jan. 4, 2014. If they have failed to perform they get voted out. Don't tell me that we don't have time to test leaders, because we're treading water anyhow. Its not the best solution, it's the only solution.

On Structure: This should be very simple. There are two Chambers

A schism is a lazy solution and a selfish ambition. How can you honestly sit here in the midst of history and ponder how best to dismember the movement? History provides opportunities and we either seize them or let them pass into the ether. If you think anyone is taking us seriously at this point your deluding yourself. We don't seem to take ourselves seriously. I leave you to ponder [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gb_qHP7VaZE) . The only difference between that and our movement right now is that the clip is intended to be laughable.

The idea is to get a viral video made that highlights personal stories of how governments who spy on their citizens

At the same time, what we can show is that we know the what the government is doing is legal, but only because they made it so and the laws need to change.  The potential for abuse is there and even if they are not abusing it now, somebody will given enough time and we need to be protected against that.

So basically what I'm looking for is ideas on content and help from anyone who is good at making videos

The key to this video being successful, and if we sensationalize or make up things to get people to watch it then we lose all credibility.

In less than three days, but we have only just started.

Now it is time for the next step. I have created a new subreddit called /r/rtforganizers (Restore The Fourth Organizers) on which every thread is a city

We are going to be updating our current ""list of upcoming protests"" threads to link there instead. 

----

**Organizers:** Please find your city in the list, etc. If you do not yet have this worked out, then please tell us in that thread so that we can help. If you do not see your city listed, please contact me or any other moderator of /r/rtforganizers so that we can add that city. We will update the main text of each thread according to the comments posted.

**Participants:** Please find your city (or a city close to you) in the list of threads

See the sidebar of that subreddit for additional information.

Also, plan who is going to do what, etc. However, please do NOT use /r/rtforganizers for general discussion, that is what /r/restorethefourth is for.

I know some people from this sub have already publicly demonstrated.  Yet not a peep from the media.  It's clear the media is practically ignoring the entire NSA issue: the Obama/Benghazi scandal got far more coverage.  Is the lack a reflection of the general public's reaction - a simple and valid measure of how little people care?  Is there a media storm pending more official responses and hearings?  Or waiting for the 'further revelations' promised by Greenwald?  

Or is this, we already knew that, big deal""?

I find the actions of the NSA, treasonous and vile beyond words.  The response should be that all those responsible should be held accountable, and removed from office and replaced if possible.  I know I'm not alone.  

We need to make ourselves heard.  We need to let the government know that this will not go away; that Americans *will not tolerate* a government that does not respect the Constitution.

I hope this movement grows.  I fear it will go the way of the Occupy movement, and Politically Correct Zero-Tolerance Nanny-State proponents grew to eclipse the founder's intent and passion.  Occupy is now so mainstreamed that it's trendy at posh conservative cocktail parties to drop that you volunteered to help the Occupy movement.  The Occupy subreddit has 2,028 members now.

1370815151.0,1g06vp,PRISM Protest Chicago! [tba-planning at hand],Machine-Broken,126,23,105,"**Update**

Thanks to everyone who came. Everyone there had something to contribute

The meeting was held from 7:00pm CST to 9:00pm June 19, and organizing and logistics for Chicago's Restore the Fourth rally on July 4th.

Our message to our legislators should focus on rolling back. Scale back the NSA, etc. Specifically:

    Roll back the patriot act.
    Discuss operational transparency regarding the NSA &amp; FISA.
    Remove the gag order on companies involved with the NSA.
    Remove immunity to legal actions for companies involved with the NSA.
    Add metadata to the kinds of data protected by the 4th amendment and define the steps and requirements for search and seizure.

The challenge lies in contacting congressional offices. Congress is on vacation starting July 1. Talk to them that week and try to arrange a face-to-face meeting. Put an APB on reddit

Finally

Next we discussed planning for the Restore the Fourth rally:

Confirmed date:

    July 4th

Confirmed time:

    12:00 noon

Location:

    Daley Plaza

Purpose:

    Educate the public on what the 4th amendment is, and what they can do to change it. We'll stop at points along the march to disperse and hand out literature, engage in public speaking, and engage the public one-on-one. After a set time we'll regroup and march to the next location. We may chant while marching, and we will have signs to draw attention to us. We will make a post on the r4Chciago Facebook page looking for speakers and other rally volunteers.

Dress code:

    Dress well

Legality:

    We may not need a permit so long as we keep to the sidewalks and do not block the roads. We may not need a permit to gather at Daley Plaza. The ACLU has a page that describes protest action legalities. We should find the Chicago one.

Relationship with the national movement:

    /u/NoUrImmature has volunteered to be Chicago's general and media point of contact.

Social/Internet Media:

    A simple website will be constructed with our mission statement
    Kevin is researching if it's possible to attain the URLs chicago.restorethefourth.net or www.restoretheforuth.net/chicago
    Kevin is researching the feasibility of attaining the email address chicago@restorethefourth.net for official communication. We'll use rtfchicago@gmail.com as a fallback.
    https://www.facebook.com/RTFChicago will contain primary info for the general public, events, etc. Please like this page, and like+share its posts.
    Kevin and Shawn will begin to use @RTFChicago. Please follow it and retweet if you use Twitter.
    /r/r4Chicago will be used to plan rally logistics.
    Kevin will update Chicago's entry at www.restorethefourth.net/protests

Flyers:

    Paul works at a marketing company and knows some designers who may make flyers for us.
    Please post flyers you make to /r/r4Chicago. Official ones will go in a Facebook photo album.

Media:

    Contact your local TV, and other media. Say who we are, what our rally is about, and drop our email address as a point of contact for more information.

Local Outreach:

    Ask to speak at local political and social meetings. Speak about us and our rally. Hand out flyers if possible.
    Insist that those from other political groups who participate know they are participating in a Restore the Fourth event. We remain non-partisan.
    ""Guerrilla marketing"" tactics are fine so long as they are legal.

Miscellaneous:

    The event on July 4th is not a ""protest"". It is a ""rally"".
    Please know the 4th amendment by heart and keep up to date on talking points.
    Paul is setting up a wepay account so we can pool resources to pay for materials and incidentals.

Next Meting:

    Next Thursday June 28. /u/analogkid01 is researching using Harold Public Library with the Next-Door Cafe as a fallback. Full announcement TBA.

By Laura K. Donohue

*Laura K. Donohue is a professor at Georgetown University Law Center and director of Georgetown’s Center on National Security and the Law.*

The National Security Agency’s recently revealed surveillance programs undermine the purpose of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act

The intelligence community has a history of overreaching in the name of national security. In the mid-1970s, the NSA had been collecting international telegraphic traffic from companies, in the process obtaining millions of Americans’ telegrams that were unrelated to foreign targets. From 1940 to 1973, the CIA and the FBI engaged in covert mail-opening programs that violated laws prohibiting the interception or opening of mail. The agencies also conducted warrantless “surreptitious entries,” breaking into targets’ offices and homes to photocopy or steal business records and personal documents. The Army Security Agency intercepted domestic radio communications. And the Army’s CONUS program placed more than 100,000 people under surveillance, including lawmakers and civil rights leaders.

After an extensive investigation of the agencies’ actions

We’ve learned that in April, Sprint and other telecommunications providers.

Another program, allows the NSA and the FBI to obtain online data including e-mails, photographs, documents and connection logs. The information that can be assembledabout any one person — much less organizations, social networks and entire communities — is staggering: What we do, think and believe.

The government defends the programs’ legality

Under the traditional FISA, identitying or describing the target. It must demonstrate probable cause that the target is a foreign power or an agent thereof, and that the facilities to be monitored will be used by the target.

In 2008, without a court order for each target. A U.S. citizen may not intentionally be targeted.

To the extent that the FISC sanctioned PRISM

The telephony metadata program raises similar concerns. FISA did not originally envision the government accessing records. Following the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, the government no longer has to prove that the target is a foreign power. It need only state that the records are sought as part of an investigation to protect against terrorism or clandestine intelligence.

This means that FISA can now be used to gather records concerning individuals who are neither the target of any investigation nor an agent of a foreign power. Entire databases — such as telephony metadata — can be obtained

Congress didn’t pass Section 215 to allow for the wholesale collection of information. As Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner Jr. (R-Wis.)

As a constitutional matter, search and seizure may occur only once the government has obtained a warrant, supported by probable cause and issued by a judge. The warrant must specify the places to be searched and items to be seized.

There are exceptions to the warrant requirement. In 1979 the court held that the use of a pen register to record numbers dialed from someone’s home was not a search. The court suggested that people who disclose their communications to others assume the risk that law enforcement may obtain the information.

More than three decades later, when analyzed, have much deeper implications for our privacy than before.

As for Section 702 of FISA

Americans reasonably expect that their movements, long-term monitoring “impinges on expectations of privacy.” Justice Sonia Sotomayor recognized that following a person’s movements “reflects a wealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual associations.”

The FISC is supposed to operate as a check. But it is a secret court, out of nearly 8,600 applications, only two have been denied.

Congress has an opportunity to create more effective checks on executive power. It could withdraw Sections 215 and 702 and introduce new measures to regulate intelligence collection and analysis. There are many options.

---Scan youtube, figure out why and report it.


---Coordinate between the national organization and the designers. Make sure only final copies get distributed


---Make sure everyone feels appreciated. It's not ""marketing's"" work. It's the designers


**Up next in the agenda is a PR update:**


---PR is currently creating a templated press release


---TheBlaze article should go live tomorrow

This movement is asking the same repressive government that is encroaching on these rights to restore them. Unless you can make yourselves something to be reckoned with, something that will actually make the ruling class listen.

The ruling class benefits from a very powerful thing. They control society's productivity, the media, the workplace, *they appropriate the economic output of working people*. What is the best way to shake them then? A strike of course! Now is restorethefourth going to do that, I dunno, but hear me out. Society withholding it's labor means that the profits of the capitalist class who controls the country also are at a standstill. If working people decide to appropriate that wealth for themselves, this seriously scares the ruling class. Now the labor movement is quite fragmented and weak at this time, but that's something you should consider in the future.
 
Now you'll say to me, they represent us of course!"" However, aside from a few special exceptions who will find this to be a great opportunity to put themselves in a good light, or a few naive politicians who thought they really could fight the system from within when they were elected, the politicians don't represent us. Politicians aren't going to fight against this, because this spying program is an AMAZING tool for the ruling class. Just think, if they want to keep the populace in check they have all the info about who these people are right at their very fingertips, they aren't going to give it up willingly.

In order to shake the institutions that control society it's necessary to call into question the system that gives them power, it's not really going to get very far. Especially if it's just a one off protest that doesn't keep escalating it's demands.

Also, free markets are the only true liberty, etc, etc, but whether or not we have ""true capitalism"" or not doesn't matter, because what we have now must be called into question and fought against regardless.

 We do not need to raise funds for protesting. Just print off your own flyers and bring your own camera/phone. We DO NOT need a special force just for taking pictures. Everybody needs to. There is to much attention to detail in this subreddit. No dress code. 

For Protesting:

Step one: make sure people KNOW WHEN IT IS. Emphasize that a lot.



Get their signatures that they are promising to come.



Step two(or part of one): make sure you and the other protestors KNOW



WHAT YOUR PROTESTING ABOUT.




Step three: constantly (but not constantly to the point of annoyance)




send out updates as to how you are doing an how this will help and what




the mission statement it. And it kinda rallies them together. If the




protest is a long time away then it reminds them. (maybe once a week?




Twice MAYBE)




Step four: when conducting the protest make sure it's NON VOILENT that




will help the protesters safety




style points with the cops.




Step five: after the protest




participated saying thanks and it was a help ect.. Try organizing another




even bigger one.




Some tips: try toget the news to report what your doing BUT make sure




they fully understand what your doing. Or you could be smeared.





Get lots of video of what's going on before




upload it to YouTube




happened it was the cops fault. (they usually instigate things)




And REMEBER: Stay safe




Be passionate




NON VIOLENT



We need to have people knowing when things are. The more people who know the more people that will show. It will be tough getting them out because the main stream media is downplaying and not even reporting protests. I don't trust the Main Stream Media anymore. Something is very wrong here.

First off, which was great thinking. 

I arrived and was excited as there seemed to be a good turn out (including state police, exerts from his speech.

The NSA was made by the devil.

This is happening because we have left god and are no longer a Christian nation.

The only way to end this is to turn to god and repent.

Only belief and acceptance of Jesus Christ can end this.

God brought us all together for a greater cause.

He read a passage

After the passage he asked all those who believed his statement to raise their hands. (I must add that about a fourth of us did not raise our hands.)

Immediately following he said, and let us pray.""

There was talk about Obama being a ""migrant"". I'm not sure if this came from him

He talked about his business and cleaning up messes in hotels, bio-hazard cleanups, etc. (I could see where he was going with it by trying, and failing, to link his cleanup experience to cleaning up the NSA. He failed, miserably)

I can go on, which again, a good fourth of us did not, several protesters left! I was there for a grand total of five minutes before I left due to the absurdity. 

I understand a lot of this was planned last minute and within a week, alienate people. It will also make us look like religious lunatics and we will never be taken seriously.

We need to screen the public speakers that the organizers invite so we don't alienate support! I am not asking to infringe on 1st Amendment rights; people can say what they want. I am simply saying we need to ensure our public speakers remain on topic

His speech reminded me of Tea Party speeches. According to this subreddit

This protest was absurd and an embarrassment to the organization. We need to ensure we stay on topic about the NSA, that's dandy. Just keep it out of the main speeches so we don't alienate our support. I will be very surprised if I attend another protest because of this fiasco and blatant proselytizing.

2. July 4th is a national holiday. The media will have their broadcasting for this day planned well in advance

3. Even though this issue is incredibly important and could very likely be another checkpoint on America's journey into something incredibly frightening, and will be far more interested in consuming alcoholic beverages and playing with fireworks than they will be in engaging in protests against the government. This is especially true in situations where Americans have children and would rather spend the holiday with them.


Additionally, and then, suddenly, simultaneously, take to the streets. 

I believe that those of us in small towns are particularly fortunate in that we can manufacture close relationships with our local media and get coverage in the small papers first. I know, I could easily get my local paper to run, as a headline, ""'Restore the fourth': Protests in Portland this weekend in response to concerns US is headed toward authoritarianism""

My stance on this issue is not concrete; I am open to arguments against my view on this. We need to do what is best for the potential success of this movement

Think about the implications of this: If the NSA is wire tapping elected officials under the Patriot Act

According to a recent [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2013/06/general-keith-alexander-cyberwar/all/), as well as a four-star general in the United States Army has a personal cyber army and literal military at his disposal, including the keys to all of our cyber security infrastructure and has dirt on literally the entire planet. This guy is potentially the most powerful man in the world right now.

From Wired:
&gt;""We jokingly referred to him as Emperor Alexander—with good cause,” says one former senior CIA official who agreed to speak on condition of anonymity. “We would sit back literally in awe of what he was able to get from Congress, from the White House, and at the expense of everybody else.”

Essentially the NSA is in a position to blackmail elected officials

&gt; None of the judges of the FISA court were vetted by Congress. They were appointed by a single unelected official: John Roberts, but where arguments are only ever submitted on behalf of the government, and whose judges are not subject to the approval of a democratic body, sounds a lot like the sort of thing authoritarian governments set up when they make a half-hearted attempt to create the appearance of the rule of law.

Dear Local Organizers
 
As you may know, but is now transitioning towards a new structure that is more transparent and better integrates local organizers in general.
 
The next step in this transition is the formation of a committee of 15 members that will have the responsibility of determining the long-term structure of Restore the Fourth. This committee will be made up of the six individuals that currently serve as the national organization's board as well as nine additional local organizers from different cities that took part in July 4th's protests. The purpose of this email
 
If you intend to continue to organize future Restore the Fourth events or consider yourself the best current representative of those in your area who might, please determine and locate that person and have him/her get back to us as soon as possible.
 
To be eligible to represent a local chapter in this committee

- let us know, an email you check regularly, and a phone number we can contact you at. Your phone number will never be made public.

- be willing to have your full name

- have at least several hours to spend over the next week to take part in discussing

- represent a city that successfully staged an active protest on July 4th. If you haven’t sent photos and/or participation estimates to socialmedia@restorethefourth.net or organizing@restorethefourth.net

- be committed to Restore the Fourth’s basic principles of: defending the Fourth Amendment

Over the course of this weekend
 
Here are some of the questions this committee will need to address...

- What will be the ultimate decision-making body for Restore the Fourth National? Which members of the committee will be part of it (or will all be? or all and more? etc.) By what criteria will its members be determined?

- What other official national organization bodies (whether a part of

- How frequently will each meet

- What will the relationship be between these bodies and local chapters

This committee will aim to reach a consensus on these four questions by Thursday July 18th. If no consensus is reached by Sunday July 21st, but some formal decision-making body - with a publicly available list of members and rules - must be announced by this committee on this schedule.
 
All local organizers are encouraged to respond to this email with thoughts on how we move forward structurally, and opening up more effective ways of doing so.

Thank you for your patience and hard work

It would be an effective tactic if groups of protesters picked out government workers (police, but the higher profile the better) and record them publicly and non-stop for as long as possible in both work and play. Also stand outside government buildings and film the entrances and exits non-stop. Edit and submit anything interesting to youTube. Do this in large groups and for as long as possible. Make it uncomfortable whenever possible. You could follow police cars around reporting there every move. You could also record what government officials and politicians eat for lunch and what coffee they are drinking and all kinds of annoying details and see how they like it. Anything protesters can do to turn the tables I think would be effective and illumininating.

I think it's important to make the people in the government experience the annoyance and self-censorship of surveillance and for the general public to see and experience a protest method that is to the point. We need to illustrate the chilling and horrible effect that living in a surveillance state has on the quality of life and make the other side experience it.

So we have run into a small problem here. We are organizing protests and trying to spread the word when this can take months

I was thinking of how to quickly spread the word. So kony 2012 had 100K views in 3 days. They had celebrates tweeting and facebooking about the video. They had the video and word spread like a wildfire. 

So here is what I suggest:
Tweet to major technology celebrities and ask(kindly) to retweet it.
Same thing with facebook


If you are up to spending maybe just half an hour to tweet/facebooking to celebrities it can make a difference.
Here is what I sugguest tweeting/facebooking:
""Together we can stop domestic spying. Visit /r/Restorethefourth.""



or ""Customized tweet #Restorethe4th""
Or something to that effect.



***---VIDEO MAKERS***

we need ya! Take a look on the intro for Kony 2012. Look how it grabs your attention and does not make you want to close out. It does not have that annoying heavy metal

Please make a video that is well put together.


***---Protesting***



In this subreddit,ect../and the everyday celebrities too). 


_______________________________________-----PROTESTING-----_______________________________________


 Step one: make sure people KNOW WHEN IT IS. Emphasize that a lot.



Get their signatures that they are promising to come.



Step two(or part of one): make sure you and the other protestors KNOW



WHAT YOUR PROTESTING ABOUT.



Step three: constantly (but not constantly to the point of annoyance)



send out updates as to how you are doing an how this will help and what



the mission statement it. And it kinda rallies them together. If the



protest is a long time away then it reminds them. (maybe once a week?



Twice MAYBE)



Step four: when conducting the protest make sure it's NON VOILENT that



will help the protesters safety



style points with the cops.



Step five: after the protest



participated saying thanks and it was a help ect.. Try organizing another



even bigger one.



Some tips: try toget the news to report what your doing BUT make sure



they fully understand what your doing. Or you could be smeared.



Get lots of video of what's going on before



upload it to YouTube


happened it was the cops fault. (they usually instigate things)



And REMEBER: Stay safe


Be passionate



NON VIOLENT



***PROGRAMMERS***

We need a official website. This subreddit wont do as one. It gets cluttered up with random, then can somebody please make one. PLease have it look:


* Professional


* Well done


* Crisp



* Not cluttered



* Easy to read


* Include visuals


* Mobile friendly

---Current websites---



* https://www.Restorethefourth.net

***Help with staying safe***



Here is a compiled list of ways to stay safe
Here it is:



* Use Bitcoin over Tor




* Have a specific machine which you boot with a lived CD such as Tails of 


lunix with the HDD removed



* Use public wifi and sit out of view of the cameras



* Set up a PO Box with a fake name and have all your mail go through that



* Register a small company and sell your house to yourself so it is all under the company's details (a bit extreme I know)



* Set up your own mail server and secure it.(Hard)



* Use the Tor browser bundle



* Use email encryption (gpg)



* Use Off The Record instant messaging



* Install a lunix distro use full disk encryption( most of them have it built into the installer these days)



* Use a disposable debit card with a fake name



* Sign up to services with details e.g. amazon



* Make use of 12p and or Tor for hosting your own website



* Make use of freenet



* Use i2p for torrents



* Pay by cash



* Support the organizations the stand up for your rights (FSF,ACLU, TorProject ect)



* Pay attention to the attack on privacy



* Share what you lean with others



* Move away from hotmail,aol, and choose a provider outside of the US.



* Delete Facebook



* Set all your profiles to private.



* Try to avoid real details where ever possible



* Turn off Geolocation in your browser.



* Use a fake Email whenever you sign up for apps and things like that



* Shred letters with your personal details on them



* If you insist on having a Facebook



* Use startpage/ixquick or duckduckgo as your search engine



* Cover or disconnect your webcam when not in use.



* Try not to tag yourself in pictures



* find a no-log VPN



* Use truecrypt as much as possible/File Vault for Mac



* Get some SED (self encrypting drives) - Flash-Drives (Kingston etc.)



* SSD-Drives (Samsung etc.)



* HD-Drives (WD



* Make sure that you modify the BIOS so that nothing llike a flashdrive can be booted up during the computers booting up process



* Never use your system password outside of your system (protects against key logging)



* It is advised to use a WIRED LAN that a WLAN



* Do daily scans for rootkits



* Use DNScript



* Use HTTPS everywhere (or type https://....)



* Try out I2P and Freenet



* Don’t forget about proxies!



* Use a VPN in other countries (use a proxy and https everywhere(addon) when using a VPN))



* Use gpg/enigmail when mailing people(only works if they reply with encrypted messages too



* Find a disposable mail address(not Gmail or Yahoo mail)



* Use a 18+ random character password with special keys



* Use a live cd (already mentioned) with tails(cant work if you modify the BIOS)



* Use silent Circle(costs some money) for calling and texting



* Don’t forget about DuckDuckgo.com


***----ADS!***

So we all need to find a way to get a 1-2 second ad in to the Nightly News. Like NBC. It would be the image of the NSA like meme like

----

On June 6th, to our shock and horror, that what we thought were our private communications were in fact being monitored by federal agents without our knowledge or consent. 

We learned that this monitoring was applied not only to suspected criminals

We cannot sit idly by while this is going on. We refuse to live in a world where everything we say and everywhere we go could be being monitored. We refuse to watch the country we love become hijacked by individuals who feel they can simply rewrite our constitution to meet their goals; who require us to ""rethink"" our fourth amendment rights. We refuse to accept that someone, text messages, and other communications we make with our friends and loved ones. We refuse to live in fear, and we refuse to live in subjugation to a government that has forgotten its place. 

Therefore, so named due to our desire to restore our fourth amendment rights. At the time of this press release, only 2 days later, we are ten thousand strong. We have so far planned peaceful protests in over fifty cities around the country, although we expect that number to increase substantially.

We come from all across the political spectrum. We count republicans and democrats
us to our common purpose is this: We believe that the right to be secure in our persons against unlawful search and seizure is a fundamental human right; one which cannot and
should not be violated.

We demand the following:

1. By exercising our right to vote and peacefully protest, simply removal from office.

2. Repeal the patriot act and other similar laws. If our currently elected representatives will not do so (highly unlikely)

3. The implementation of a transparent government which respects the fourth amendment and represents the interests of the people of the United States of America.

There are now 205 Congress men and women that are publicly on record as opposing a bureaucratic program that has the potential to blackmail those same members of Congress.

Even if no one in the NSA acts on these thoughts now, or  maybe a couple of these guys.'  So something a little fishy comes up - a pattern that indicates a hidden email account, something like happened to Petraeus.  So they pursue, find no security threat, but now they have something politically embarrassing.  They have leverage in the next vote. They promise themselves never to use it, but it is always there in the backs of their minds.

This may actually have happened already.  How do we know that the entirety of the Congressional votes against the Amash amendment are untainted? Both the President and the Vice-President were adamant opponents of meta-data collection prior to taking office.  Yet they changed into ardent supporters once they took office.  Was this just the normal change of perspective that comes with assuming responsibility?  Or has the NSA followed in the footsteps of J Edgar Hoover and made certain provisions that their bureaucratic asses and pet programs are 'protected' against political interference?

That is one of the insidious characteristics of  PRISM. And the thing is, and - for sure- it will happen in the future.

We also know that these bureaucrats are liars.  James Clapper lied outright to Congress. And he is still in a position of  trust  with the power to easily dig up embarrassing information

As you may already know, in which we've found *it*) over the past few months.

The product of all this discussion, yes, more voting is this: /r/ReinstateArticle8, the now-home of the (#)Reinst8 Movement.

I'd like to keep this description relatively brief, you say? Perhaps, but the ideology has to govern the action. With the focus on a clear-cut message (of the kind 'Don't invade our privacy; don't encroach on our liberty' - slogan is in the works, so don't worry if you hate my wording) rather than on specific actions (PORN FILTERS BAD, TWO LEGS GOOD), we ought to be able to inspire a far more broad, far more lasting change

We are very much in the setting-up phase, some web-devs, some people with legal and political experience). **However, we [almost certainly need you](http://www.reddit.com/r/ReinstateArticle8/comments/1iujx1/reinst8_needs_you/)**.

If you've even a fleeting interest in digital privacy, then I strongly urge you to get involved. You don't need any particular skills, just an interest. Our primary goal is to get people talking, to raise the debate to a national level and, ultimately, to inspire action where once ill-informed apathy was found.

**/r/ReinstateArticle8 - Get involved.**

The argument has been raised numerous times that although this action by the administration is legal

Mr. Obama has defended his administration on the grounds that they sought out a general warrant. **United States law does not permit any general warrants.** Other countries have general warrants

The NSA's so-called ""general warrant"" to tap our internet activity fails two of the three essential criteria for being a legitimate warrant in the United States. First of all, the government is claiming they have sufficient levels of suspicion to arrest every single person who ever used Google or Facebook. That's just laughable on its face.

1370757428.0,1fywtm,This is our future.,wewantchange,50,5,2,"I live in a country generally assumed to be a dictatorship. One of the Arab spring countries. I have lived through curfews and have seen the outcomes of the sort of surveillance now being revealed in the US. People here talking about curfews aren't realizing what that actually FEELS like. It isn't about having to go inside

1) the purpose of this surveillance from the governments point of view is to control enemies of the state. Not terrorists. People who are coalescing around ideas that would destabilize the status quo. These could be religious ideas. These could be groups like anon who are too good with tech for the governments liking. It makes it very easy to know who these people are. It also makes it very simple to control these people.

Lets say you are a college student and you get in with some people who want to stop farming practices that hurt animals. So you make a plan and go to protest these practices. You get there, you were just goofing off. Well now everyone who was there is suspect. Even though you technically had the right to protest, you're now considered a dangerous person.

With this tech in place, is help them catch your friends in the group. You have to report back every week, or you dad might lose his job. So you do. You turn in your friends and even though they try to keep meetings off grid, you're reporting on them to protect your dad.

2) Let's say number one goes on. The country is a weird place now. Really weird. Pretty soon, and they are saying they want a government without this power. I guess people are realizing that it is a serious deal. You see on the news that tear gas was fired. Your friend calls you, frantic. They're shooting people. Oh my god. you never signed up for this. You say, fuck it. My dad might lose his job but I won't be responsible for anyone dying. That's going too far. You refuse to report anymore. You just stop going to meetings. You stay at home, and try not to watch the news. Three days later, police come to your door and arrest you. They confiscate your computer and phones, and they beat you up a bit. No one can help you so they all just sit quietly. They know if they say anything they're next. This happened in the country I live in. It is not a joke.

3) Its hard to say how long you were in there. What you saw was horrible. Most of the time, but no one shocked you. No one used sexual violence on you, at least that you remember. There were some times they gave you pills, and you can't say for sure what happened then. To be honest, sometimes the pills were the best part of your day, because at least then you didn't feel anything. You have scars on you from the way you were treated. You learn in prison that torture is now common. But everyone who uploads videos or pictures of this torture is labeled a leaker. Its considered a threat to national security. Pretty soon, a cut you got on your leg is looking really bad. You think it's infected. There were no doctors in prison, who knows what got in the cut. You go to the doctor

You decide to go home and see your parents. Maybe they can help. This leg is getting really bad. You get to their house. They aren't home. You can't reach them no matter how hard you try. A neighbor pulls you aside

4) Is this even really happening? You look at the news. Sports scores. Celebrity news. It's like nothing is wrong. What the hell is going on? A stranger smirks at you reading the paper. You lose it. You shout at him ""fuck you dude what are you laughing at can't you see I've got a fucking wound on my leg?""

""Sorry

Everyone walking around is scared. They can't talk to anyone else because they don't know who is reporting for the government. Hell

You want to protest. You want your family back. You need help for your leg. This is way beyond anything you ever wanted. It started because you just wanted to see fair treatment in farms. Now you're basically considered a terrorist

This all happened in the country where I live.

You want to know why revolutions happen? Because little by little by little things get worse and worse. But this thing that is happening now is big. This is the key ingredient. This allows them to know everything they need to know to accomplish the above. The fact that they are doing it is proof that they are the sort of people who might use it in the way I described. In the country I live in

Maybe Obama won't do it. Maybe the next guy won't, or after another big attack. Maybe it's about your daughter or your son. We just don't know yet. But what we do know is that right now, in this moment we have a choice. Are we okay with this, or not? Do we want this power to exist, or not?

You know for me, the government just violated that ideal. So if they aren't standing for liberty and justice anymore, what are they standing for?Safety?

Ask yourself a question. In the story I told above

I didn't make anything up. These things happened to people I know. We used to think it couldn't happen in America. But guess what? It's starting to happen.

I actually get really upset when people say ""I don't have anything to hide. Let them read everything."" People saying that have no idea what they are bringing down on their own heads. They are naive

​As of last night, I’d like to give those of you who don’t know me a little background on what I have done with the movement so far. 

​Since I joined the movement, where I helped as much as possible for a day or so. A day or two may not sound like much time, but if you imagine working between 14-18 hours in one channel for almost two days, you get the picture of how tedious that can be. After that time, I decided I just wanted to pick up whatever project I could get my hands on, and helped many different people with many aspects of the movement. I helped draft the FAQ of the website, wrote the training manual for meeting chairs, and many other different important documents.

​The thing that is most important to me when it comes to leadership is making sure that I know the concerns and feelings of every group involved before I make a decision on anything. For those of you who go to the meetings on the IRC channel, which I feel is paramount to being a good leader.

​Now for the details on what I would like to do. As National Coordinator, so that you can learn more about each person’s involvement in the movement, and why they should be accepted into their corresponding posts. This is something that the community will decide, so make sure you carefully think about what would be the best for the movement!

​I’d also like to say thank you all for all that you have done for this movement. If it wasn’t for all of the hard workers, and the people that decided to make a change, our movement wouldn’t be as great as it has been turning into. I encourage you all to keep doing what you are doing, because if we do, we CAN keep our rights from being trampled on again, and that is something we need to work hard to do! 

​If anyone has any ideas for the movement, because we want to know what YOU think would make the movement thrive, and we need volunteers to make the ideas happen!

I'm representing the PR people from the irc involved with the restore the fourth movement

If this gets as big as we want it to, a lot of press. we're trying to prepare for that now by setting up a network of PR representatives who would represent the movement on a regional level. 

This means that you would be responsible for representing the nationwide movement on a regional basis. 

Here's how it would work: let's say a reporter wanted either an interview with leaders of the movement, whether it be an interview, additional information, etc. 

We need people to be those regional representatives. 



If you're interested

* A working email and telephone number that you would be willing to publicize ( you may get your own email in the future

* Absolute dedication to our movement (no quitting halfway through

* An understanding that if you take up this responsibility you will NOT be anonymous. your identity and contact information will be known.

* excellent mannerisms, whether they be positive or negative. 

*  Large-scale involvement and knowledgeability in regards to your local Protesting efforts in every aspect. 

This responsibility will not be a walk in the park. it will require effort and dedication. remember that one misstep could dislodge and derail our entire movement

If you have any questions or concerns

Thanks in advance guys. -RT4PR

&gt; 
&gt;As you know, and after careful consideration, I opposed the Amash-Conyers amendment because I believe it would have destroyed a vital tool that our government uses to defend our nation against foreign terrorists seeking to murder our fellow citizens.  I also believe it went against the first and foremost Constitutional responsibility of the federal government, which is to defend America against our enemies.  
&gt; 
&gt;I do not believe that the rights guaranteed by our Constitution extend to foreign terrorists, is probably unwise and possibly un-Constitutional.""
&gt; 
&gt;The program that this amendment would destroy has been credited with helping to stop 54 terrorist plots in 20 countries around the world against American citizens, who has been wrongly charged with any crime, or has been harmed in any way.  In my opinion, the threat to our civil liberties suggested by the Amash-Conyers Amendment is a phantom threat that does not exist.  As my colleague on the House Intelligence Committee, Representative Michelle Bachmann, said, the sponsors of the Amash-Conyers Amendment are putting forward a false narrative.
&gt; 
&gt;One of the attacks that this program provided the key piece of information that allowed our intelligence and law enforcement officials to stop was the plot to explode bombs on the New York City subway system. That plot was led by an Afghan immigrant, and it was thwarted just before it was set to take place. Law enforcement officials estimate that 1,000 or more Americans would have been killed if this brutal and evil attack had been carried out.  Those are the facts, and many innocent men, women and children are alive today because this program allowed the government to connect the dots and stop this attack before the terrorists struck, just as it was admonished to do by the 9/11 Commission, to better protect our nation.  That is real and just one example of the attacks avoided and lives saved due to this program.  
&gt; 
&gt;I wonder how many dead Americans the supporters of the Amash-Conyers Amendment would be willing to accept in the effort to protect an alleged 4th Amendment protection for terrorists like Najibullah Zazzi.  I say 'alleged' because the program in place does not violate the 4th Amendment protections of Americans.  In the 1979 Smith v. Maryland decision, such as number and duration of the call, to support this program violates no individual's rights under the 4th Amendment.  
&gt; 
&gt;It is also disappointing the supporters of the Amash-Conyers Amendment put forward so much false and misleading information.  Many led people to believe that the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Court, but also the content of telephone conversations.  This is simply untrue.  All that is collected is phone numbers and duration of calls.  No names, no addresses, and no content is attached to this information.  They also led people to believe that the NSA has unfettered access to this information.  This is also untrue.  In fact, the NSA cannot even do a search of the data for a particular phone number unless they have a court order provided for a specific purpose.  In 2012, there were fewer than 300 searches on this data; hardly a broad trampling of the rights of 360,000
&gt; 
&gt;The supporters of this amendment have also voted to release the terrorists being held at Guantanamo Bay and either send them back to their countries or bring them into American civilian courts for trial.  I believe, including 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheik Muhammed, is wrongheaded, makes our nation less secure, is unprecedented in our nation's history and emboldens our enemies to make further attacks on American citizens and interests.

&gt;However

&gt; 
&gt;The Nugent-Pompeo Amendment makes perfectly clear that the content of any communication of Americans within our nation are off limits to collection by the NSA under FISA
&gt; 
&gt;The Amash-Conyers Amendment, it would prevent the collection and analysis of all bulk data – not just the data of American citizens. The Amash-Conyers Amendment dictates that the NSA would not be able to collect and analyze bulk data from Yemen, Afghanistan, Egypt, Pakistan, or any other country around the world where people are actively working to murder innocent Americans.  As Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee, it is my experience that fighting terrorism is like finding a needle in a haystack.  Terrorists live in the shadows and plot secretly.  The Amash-Conyers Amendment would require that we find the needle, before our intelligence officials could even look in the haystack.
&gt; 
&gt;I refuse to go back to the pre-9/11 mindset that provides those who seek to murder our fellow citizens space to plot and scheme in the shadows while tying the hands of those seeking to stop them.  I believe that such an approach violates the first duty given to the federal government by the Constitution to provide for the common defense, and defend the Constitution.

Primarily- be respectful of everyone.

Focus on education of passersby over being a nuisance. 

More people will listen and care if you approach them respectfully than if you scream at them as they pass by. 

Avoid chanting too much- it's intimidating. 

Don't wear masks. 

Try and look somewhat professional. The stranger you look

Have paper handouts about the movement

Know what you're talking about. 

Have a 'plan-b' in case the cops show up

The cops will only have a problem with you if you start getting too aggressive, Occupy) they won't arrest you just for protesting- they literally *can't.* If it does happen for some reason, welcome to headline news. 

Know your audience- a young family with screaming children doesn't want to talk for fifteen minutes

Take some water bottles- enough to share. It's going to be hot and dehydration is dangerous. 

Bring extras of everything- flyers, etc. 

Help your official organizer with whatever they need. 

Don't antagonize anyone needlessly

Don't block traffic. Don't block the sidewalk. 

Don't bring any contraband with you. 

Don't smoke where you oughtn't. 

Listen to your organizer. 

Smile. Be approchable. Talk about it like it matters to you.  

If you stop sweating on a hot day

Get in touch with your local organizer. Like

Email

Don't be an ass. 

Don't be stupid. 

Support your fellow protester.

Don't stand alone- stand in pairs at minimum.

Keep an eye on each other. Watch for harassment

You are not there to be a hero- you are there to hand out flyers and talk to people. No drama

Don't go looking for a fight with the cops or you'll find one.

If any member of your protest starts behaving in a way that endangers the entire protest

Be safe

Let the people know that their freedoms are in jeopardy. 

Be able to explain your point in less than sixty seconds- but also be able to have an in-depth discussion. Have a concise

""Dear Mr. _______

Thank you for contacting me with your concerns regarding the recent revelations of NSA surveillance. This is an important issue and I appreciate the time you took to express your thoughts.
 
While this collection of information resulted from a decision approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Court, but the potential is there, and that worries me, particularly given this Administration’s proclivity to abuse its power in other areas. If history, teaches us one thing, it is that all power given to the government is eventually abused. This should concern us all.
 
My second concern is simply that we’ve unnecessarily crossed the line between the need to protect national security and the need to protect individual privacy. It is undeniably a balance, have not convinced me that preventing another attack on the scale of 9/11 requires this level of intrusiveness.

Press Release
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

To: the Representatives and Senators of the 113th Congress and the President of the United States

We are Restore the Fourth: a coalition of citizens from across the political spectrum. We aim to restore the Fourth Amendment to its intended purpose: ""protect[ing] the right of the people to be secure in their persons, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures"". The American people have a steadfast expectation of privacy for their personal communications, electronic and otherwise. That expectation is more than reasonable, it is self-evident.

As the courts have made clear, and other communications are protected by the Fourth Amendment. These rights have suffered systematic violations over the last 12 years and in response we have prepared a list of goals outlining our mission. Additionally, we have drafted a list of actions that we insist must be taken in order to remedy these violations and restore the fundamental Fourth Amendment rights of the American people.

Restore the Fourth seeks to:

1. Raise public awareness of the unconstitutional surveillance methods employed by the United States government.

    The American people have a right to know the actions of their government. Accountability is the foundation of democracy

2. Ensure that the scope of government surveillance is constitutional, and strictly enforced.

    Surveillance activities must be conducted within the legal bounds defined by the Constitution and US law. In order to effectively defend the rights of the people

3. Establish a clear and transparent system of accountability for the United States' intelligence community.

    A clear system of accountability is required in order to properly enforce restrictions on surveillance activities. This system must be open and visible to the American people in order to ensure that proper protocols are followed.

Restore the Fourth demands that the U.S. government:

1. Conduct a congressional hearing and a criminal investigation into the extent and constitutionality of domestic government surveillance programs.

    A full investigation must be conducted to determine the scale and legality of the actions taken by the US intelligence community. This must include revealing the scope and duration of surveillance programs

2. Reform the USA PATRIOT Act

    Many legislative actions taken since 9/11 have allowed an expansion of government surveillance powers in the name of safety and security. It is vital that these powers be reined in to stay within the boundaries outlined by the Constitution.

3. Take a federal stance against law-enforcement practices across the nation which also violate our physical security and privacy

    The PRISM program that has recently come to light is one of many slowly expanding violations of the Fourth Amendment rights of Americans. The safety and privacy of our persons must also be ensured.

4. Hold those involved in government surveillance programs accountable to stringent and transparent judicial oversight.

    Accountability is paramount to ensure such violations do not happen in the future. Those responsible for violating the Constitution must be brought to light and their conduct reviewed by a duly appointed judge to determine the legality of their behavior.

5. Remove James Clapper from his position as Director of National Intelligence.

    Director James Clapper gave misleading or false testimony before the Congress in response to inquiries by Senator Ron Wyden in a March 12, a full investigation must be conducted into Mr. Clapper's knowledge and testimony, as well as the legality of his actions.



We will hold demonstrations nationwide on July 4th
The power of a government should exist to reflect the will of its people. We, we will act swiftly to replace them. We urge you to act on these requests in order to end the violation of our rights and liberties, and to uphold the Constitution as you swore to do when you took office:

""I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States.""

1370964744.0,1g4jro,Stop PRISM,priceofliberty,34,4,1,"As we have all seen in recent weeks

In light of the recent revelation regarding the National Security Agency’s “PRISM” program,” it hurts your argument when you hide behind your computer. We are calling upon the administration to immediately cease the PRISM program, and all other related programs which violate the 4th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

One may argue that the 4th Amendment does not protect us in the case of online communications through companies, held great foresight, and indeed covers these exact problems. In addition to the cessation of these programs, we call upon all involved in the implementation of these programs to resign from their posts. In the event that these people do not, we call upon Congress, the direct representatives of the people, to do whatever is necessary to force their resignation. We, have had enough.

We are not the only members of this nation who are upset. Reddit has begun this Restore the Fourth movement, the IRS scandals and corruption in general. Before that our aim is to gather people in one place to shout about something specific, to maintain our focus and to prevent the disorder we saw in movements like OWS and the Tea Party; we want to have preliminary gatherings BEFORE the Fourth to establish more cohesion in our attempts to organize.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has helped to establish [Prism Break](http://prism-break.org/)

All of these gestures are positive, for everything about who we are has been compromised. They know our names, our faces, our phone numbers, who we associate with, and what we say in our emails, “papers and effects.”

When we protest PRISM, and be prepared to get organized.

**Code of Conduct**

Remember: We are here to educate and persuade otherwise apathetic people. Those who disagree with us will try to paint us in a negative light. (Sad but true

    Stay within the bounds of the law
    Show respect
    Stay on topic
    No profanity
    Remain orderly
    No violence
    Make preparations
    Clean up after yourselves

What is going here on Reddit is very powerful and encouraging. 4chan has also seen a surprising turnout of support against PRISM and there are over a dozen of us preparing effective propaganda, tentatively being held toward the end of June (the 22nd or the 27th). Concerned members of reddit, please lend your eyes and assistance.

I think there need to be consequences for these companies. Of course I'm not naive


**The companies that we know participated in PRISM are Mircosoft, Yahoo!, Paltalk, AOL, Apple, and Dropbox.**


At first I was concerned that the assortment of services provided by these companies will be irreplaceable with pro-freedom alternatives.


After some research


In addition, that there are consequences for betraying their users.


This list will be arranged by the functionality of the service. I hope the community can help improve this list.

* Good: [Mozilla Thunderbird](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/thunderbird/)

**Social Network**


* Bad: Google Plus


* Good: [Twitter](https://twitter.com/)


* Note: Diaspora is a open source distributed social network which doesn't claim ownership of it's user's data. 

**Important** I think the keystone of this boycott plan should be removing all personal information from your facebook profile but not deleting it. Rather, discuss etc. My ultimate hope would be that enough users migrate away from facebook to generate bad press for them and, in the process, hurt their stock price. Once facebook's bottom line is hit by our actions you'll see them scramble to backpedal in any way they can. We should make an example out of them.

I fully support this cause, but it made the protest a lot worse, and it could have been pretty awesome. I don't have solutions beside education. Maybe have someone state a brief message at the beginning of the rally and every once and a while of what we are protesting. A lot of people seemed to be confused.

My only problem is the people who didn't seem to know why they were there

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/BeGUg5A.jpg) is a prime example. The UN isn't spying on us

Then [these guys](http://i.imgur.com/a8dRkMR.jpg) pulled this banner in front of anybody. I don't even know what that means. You want socialism? Isn't that pretty much the opposite of what we want? Also this was the same guy as the UN poster.

I understand we have a right to bear arms, but it confused a lot of people. As I was leaving I heard someone say ""What is this?"" ""Some sort of 2nd amendment protest it looks like""

I realize it was short notice, but it mostly turned into people ranting about unrelated conspiracies

Then there was two provokers (might not be tied to the government or police, but go talk to the coordinators about it. This guy was walking around yelling the whole time. He found a buddy later and they yelled about how they were veterans so they can do whatever they want.

Anyway. Awesome protest. But it could be a lot better. I don't mean to be snobby about it, and all sorts of things.

Edit: Oh yeah! And the V masks! Leave them at home. When I was leaving I saw media interviewing the rifle guys and the V mask guys. The more unified we can be about our message

Edit 2: I just remembered a funny quote by one of the open mic people who I guess thought this was occupy.

Thank you for contacting me about National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance programs. I appreciate learning your views.
 
I am profoundly concerned government agencies have been secretly collecting the communication records of American citizens for the past several years. While the tools Congress has granted to the law enforcement and intelligence communities have been important in identifying dangerous terrorists and their support networks, goes too far.
 
As you may know, I insisted on sunsetting provisions so that they would automatically expire if Congress did not renew them. This would allow Congress to conduct oversight of the administration's implementation of the act.
 
The NSA’s phone surveillance program was conducted under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Under this section, that it is complying with specific guidelines set by the Attorney General and that the information sought is relevant to an authorized investigation.
 
Technically, I wrote Attorney General Eric Holder regarding the FBI’s broad application to obtain phone records. I also intend to work with the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee and pursue necessary changes to Section 215 to prevent further abuses.
 
Thanks again for contacting me.

Hello [Name of Member of Congress]

I am calling to express my grave concern over the recent findings that the National Security Agency is conducting mass

The act of gathering all records of my personal e-mails, and audio and video activities is a massive breach of my right to privacy as guaranteed by the Fourth Amendment.

This type of blanket data collection by the government erodes fundamental American values of freedom and privacy

I am calling you to ask that you take immediate action in Congress to halt this surveillance and provide a full public account of the NSA’s and the FBI’s data collection programs. I am asking you also to:

1. Repeal (a) Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act (b) the State Secrets Privilege and (c) the FISA Amendments Act
2. Introduce new legislation that will (a) eliminate the secret court system within FISA and (b) establish guidelines to stringently hold accountable any public officials who are either responsible for
3. Check the power of these surveillance programs by evaluating them in both a full congressional and Supreme Court judicial review.

Thank you

1373345435.0,1hwzpc,A Collection of Practical Ideas to Reclaim Privacy from the NSA et al.,NSNay,32,3,14,"Let me begin by distinguishing between two forms of outrage.

On one hand

Passive outrage is the kind of outrage that begins and ends with a Reddit comment. It neither progresses the people nor sets back the surveillance state. It is as placatory as prayer, when we through our own inaction only write angry comments to the Internet. This is the kind of outrage over whose sum the NSA spooks enjoy a good chuckle, and this is the kind of outrage that accomplishes squat all.

On the other hand

Active outrage is outrage channeled into plans and deeds. Those with active outrage either inspire others to action or take action themselves. They are the planners and the doers; the scripters and the actors; the pushers and the movers who, even when their champion of hope among the people has made their people hopeless. They press on because [they're as mad as hell, and they're not gonna take this anymore](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_qgVn-Op7Q).

Some people in this world belong to the former group

The question is

I make this distinction as an appeal to those who wish to transcend armchair activism,"" for it WILL be ""that bad,"" and an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Don't tell yourself ""I'm just one person,"" for in each tsunami, every drop of water has its part to play. Don't let a fear of failure obstruct an attempt at change. Don't sit on the sidelines and tell yourself ""this is not my problem"" as before you unfolds that which is everyone's problem: the biggest surveillance system in human history.

Excuses are for the weak, and make no excuses.

Before all action there must first be plans, together, can build a better tomorrow. Uncle Sam has for far too long put a Democrat puppet on one hand and a Republican puppet on the other, limiting the public discourse and dividing what was once the United States of America. Let's reunite, let's organize, let's come together instead of drifting apart, and let's once again make our government a government of the people, and for the people.

I myself propose five ideas. They carry with them too many flaws to name and number, and something is better than nothing. With that said, here are the ideas I propose.

1. Write letters to the editors of your local newspapers. Is your Congresscritter apathetic to the plight of his or her people? Do this and in these letters express your dissatisfaction in a reasoned way. If enough people do so, you first get the attention of the latter. This also allows you to reach a cohort of politically active people more accustomed to traditional news and for whom ""Reddit"" would sound like a bookstore.

2. Speak with your wallet. Get the most bang for your buck by donating to organizations whose names are backed by a proven track record, join money in politics. We the people are greater in number than they the corporations, and with our combined resources we can spark change. Money talks more than mouths, so close your complainers and open your wallets. Don't use as an excuse the fact you're living paycheck to paycheck, for this is more of an investment than a donation. The more unchecked power the government and the corporations share, the less you'll be able to save and the less you'll be able to fight. Five dollars of cash from one percent of Americans adds up to fifteen million in USD. Change is not all-or-nothing, but incremental. If enough people believe as much

3. Organize and participate in nationwide protests. As this is already underway thanks to [Restore the Fourth](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth)

4. Prepare a master document of links to resources that explain how and why the NSA programs are bad news for American citizens and for the broader world. Your average Joes and Janes are supersaturated with the propagandistic narratives of the mainstream media. They will not be swayed away from hours of narrative overload by a pithy paragraph on why Edward Snowden is a traitor to his government but a hero to his people or on why the media should focus on the leaks, and upvoting it on sight, we can both create counterpoints to media narratives and reframe the discussion in a way that benefits the popular interest. Evidence dominates discussion, so let's organize the evidence so we can dominate the discussion.

5. Streamline encryption and computer security procedures to be more convenient and accessible to experts and John Q. Public alike. As I write this, it is rare for even the most dedicated privacy advocates among us to have such a suite installed. This is because most of us have neither the time nor the patience to do so. Far too frequently in the priority system of America do we tolerate injustice to avoid inconvenience, but this flaw need not be our downfall. A technologically inclined person or group of people among you could create for the programs on [PRISM Break](http://prism-break.org) a multi-installer like [Ninite](http://www.ninite.com), or an ISO image of an OS with these programs preinstalled. In combination with a user-friendly usage guide, this could help American citizens reclaim control over both their privacy and their communications. What the government won't give, we must take; and the more convenient the taking, the greater the number of takers.

I call upon you all to express active outrage, formulate plans to be followed, and help put your own plans or the plans of others into effect. If you fear doing so, download the [Tor Browser Bundle](http://www.torproject.org/download) and do so through a second account. Upvote this post to spread public awareness.

I thought this story should be heard. /r/politics and /r/technology don't allow self posts

This all started with my teenage sister, who does a teenage girl turn to for guidance? Her mom who coincidentally has connections to the medical field. 

Anna sent mom a private message on Facebook describing the discomfort she had been having. They talked back and forth (in a text-based and obviously nonsexual manner) trying to 'troubleshoot'

At the same time

Mom sent a picture of the rash to Anna and asked her if the irritated region looked similar. Let me emphasize here that **there is only one picture that had been exchanged

So imagine my poor mother's surprise when she is woken up one morning to a Florida police officer knocking on her door. She nearly faints when she is told she is wanted for mandatory questioning on child pornography charges.

They had an entire dossier on her. Drivers license and birth certificates, obviously it wasn't difficult to explain everything away given that it was transparently obvious that my mother is not a child pornographer. But what concerned me is the police officer mentioned some organization that Facebook and Google cooperates with that can sift through our supposedly private communications for illegal activity and share those communications with local law enforcement. 

There is a certain expectation of privacy in our online communications

I asked my mom to Freedom of Information her dossier and get the name of the organization

Link to the [DONATION PAGE](http://igg.me/at/restore4th/x/3587585)

**NOTE!**: 1. The ad in the link is not at max resolution - 2. The ad will make mention of the r4 website and twitter account at the bottom of the ad

To preemptively address some questions that might pop up ITT:



* Is the New York Times ad campaign associated with the r4 movement? 

It is if your leaders choose it to be.

* Is this the final language of the ad? 

Yes.

* Is the ad TL;DR? 

The New York Times crowd doesn't do TL;DR - neither does our government. And this message is as much directed at them as to anybody else.

* Why the New York Times? 

An ad in the Times is like taking our government's own bullhorn out of its hands and yelling at them through it. We want to interrupt their signal.

* Is **two days** enough time to raise the money for the ad?

**EDIT:** Some clarifications. The NYT AD CAMPAIGN has been independent of the r4 movement. Through the IRC I approached those who identified themselves as leaders of r4 and I proposed carrying your movement's logo on the ad, amongst those who have decided to be vocal, it is not very popular.

1371183116.0,1gbgq9,Technical details for the PRISM program,pvnick3,32,3,5,"Today the Guardian [released details on the PRISM program that allow us to paint a fairly complete program on how it works](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/jun/12/microsoft-twitter-rivals-nsa-requests). Essentially

The Guardian article *VALIDATES* our worst fears, you could wiretap the president if you have a personal email.

Here's how it works (this is my opinion as a web developer

1) Fancy user interface developed by Booz Allen Hamilton. Enter email address (good choice for a unique identifier

2) Backend uses curl to send a request to NSA-certified web api on each service shown on the slide. This serves as a legally-binding FISA request either regarding a foreign agent - no court order required - or a domestic agent - secret FISA court order required (see http://www.npr.org/2013/06/13/191226106/fisa-court-appears-to-be-rubberstamp-for-government-requests) and assumed to be fulfilled by the api.

3) Most (all?) companies automatically grant request without appeal as it is a legally binding FISA order. This saves them a ton of money and, and dump it to the ""dropbox""-like system.

4) Kick off NSA equivalent of gearman worker that asynchronously checks contents of ""dropbox""-like service from each company for updates.

5) Fancy frontend shows progress bar

This is the most efficient

The steps above fulfill all constraints of details provided by Snowden, Glenn Greenwald's/the Guardian's continued updates, and the law itself. The trick is in the legal framework, not the technical details. This is why the FISA courts are secret.",,False,,1371189898.0,t3_1gbgq9

1373997056.0,1ifdxp,I contacted Senator Dianne Feinstein about NSA spying. This was her lame response.,manofmystry,35,10,10,"Dear  Mr. -------:
 
I received your communication indicating your concerns about the two National Security Agency programs that have been in the news recently.   I appreciate that you took the time to write on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to respond. 
 
First, the programs that were recently disclosed have to do with information about phone calls – the kind of information that you might find on a telephone bill – in one case, and the internet communications (such as email) of non-Americans outside the United States in the other case.  Both programs are subject to checks and balances, and oversight by the Executive Branch, the Congress, and the Judiciary.
 
As Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, that I cannot provide more detail on the value these programs provide and the strict limitations placed on how this information is used.  I take serious my responsibility to make sure intelligence programs are effective, but I work equally hard to ensure that intelligence activities strictly comply with the Constitution and our laws and protect Americans' privacy rights.
 
These surveillance programs have proven to be very effective in identifying terrorists, and in allowing the Intelligence Community and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to prevent numerous terrorist attacks.  More information on this should be forthcoming.
 
·  On June 18
 
·  While the specific uses of these surveillance programs remain largely classified
 
·  Two examples where these surveillance programs were used to prevent terrorist attacks were: (1) the attempted bombing of the New York City subway system in September 2009 by  Najibullah   Zazi and his co-conspirators; and (2) the attempted attack on a Danish newspaper that published cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed in October 2009 by U.S. citizen David Headley and his associates. 
 
·  Regarding the planned bombing of the New York City subway system, NSA noted contact from an individual in the U.S. that the FBI subsequently identified as Colorado-based  Najibullah   Zazi .  The U.S. Intelligence Community, including the FBI and NSA, worked in concert to determine his relationship with Al Qaeda, as well as identify any foreign or domestic terrorist links.  The FBI tracked  Zazi as he traveled to New York to meet with co-conspirators, where they were planning to conduct a terrorist attack using hydrogen peroxide bombs placed in backpacks.  Zazi and his co-conspirators were subsequently arrested.  Zazi eventually pleaded guilty to conspiring to bomb the NYC subway system. 
 
·  Regarding terrorist David Headley, including six Americans.  According to NSA, in October 2009, Headley, a Chicago businessman and dual U.S. and Pakistani citizen, was arrested by the FBI as he tried to depart from Chicago O'Hare airport on a trip to Europe.  Headley was charged with material support to terrorism based on his involvement in the planning and reconnaissance of the hotel attack in Mumbai 2008.  At the time of his arrest, Headley and his colleagues were plotting to attack the Danish newspaper that published the unflattering cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed
 
Not only has Congress been briefed on these programs, but also to prevent government abuses, such as surveillance of Americans without approval from the federal courts. The Act authorizes the government to gather communications and other information for foreign intelligence purposes.  It also establishes privacy protections, oversight mechanisms (including court review), and other restrictions to protect privacy rights of Americans. 
 
The laws that have established and reauthorized these programs since 9/11 have passed by mostly overwhelming margins.  For example, 2012 by a vote of 73-22 in the Senate and 301-118 in the House. 
 
Attached to this letter is a brief summary of the two intelligence surveillance programs that were recently disclosed in media articles.  While I very much regret the disclosure of classified information in a way that will damage our ability to identify and stop terrorist activity

                                       NSA Internet Talking Points

* Recent Washington Post and Guardian news articles have made allegations about an NSA
Internet collection process that purportedly obtained communications from U.S. companies.
While many of the details are classified
collection process works
* These NSA Internet-based collections refer to foreign intelligence collections under
Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA)
The articles referenced above contain numerous inaccuracies that imply the United States
Government is spying on Americans. That is just plain false.
* Section 702 is a vital legal tool that Congress reauthorized in December 2012
FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act
702
collection. There is no secret program involved - it is strictly authorized by a U.S. statute.
* Section 702 allows the Government to acquire foreign intelligence information concerning
Non-U.S. persons (foreign
* Section 702 cannot be used to target any U.S. person. Section 702 also cannot be used to
target any person located in the United States
* Section 702 prohibits the Government from ""reverse targeting"" a Non-U.S. Person as a way to
obtain communications of any American or any person located in the United States.
* Section 702 authority does not permit any backdoor collections on Americans. A courtauthorized warrant based on probable cause is
Government can obtain content communications of any U.S. Person (no matter where they are
located)
* Section 702 allows the government to obtain critical information about foreign adversaries that
threaten Americans and U.S. interests. Section 702 collections provide intelligence about:
* Terrorists' plots
* Cyber threats to the United States
* Weapons of mass destruction and nuclear proliferation networks.
* Section 702 collections are subject to rigorous
Executive Branch
* The FISA Court must approve Section 702 collections to ensure that only Non-U.S.
Persons are targeted. The FISA Court also ensures that any incidentally acquired
information about U.S. persons is scrubbed and purged.
* Every 60 days
conduct detailed on-site reviews to ensure compliance with Section 702.
* The House and Senate Intelligence Committees conduct regular oversight of the
intelligence collection under the FISA Amendments Act.
* The unauthorized disclosure of information about this critical legal tool puts our national
security in grave danger

We plan to invite law professors, and local activist organizations (lib &amp; con, including Tea Party &amp; ACLU) to speak at our rally.

We want the rally to include speeches from all the people and organizations listed above, with a short statement opposing the trampling of the 4th Amendment. There will be additional space for people to write their own messages and sign their names. 

We would like to have all politicians present sign a pledge to oppose legislation that would diminish privacy or violate the 4th Amendment; to be maximally transparent (within the bounds of law) about government efforts to violate the 4th; and to work to protect whistleblowers that reveal illegal or unethical behavior within government.

We would also like to distribute a small brochure or card that explains how people can use [Tor](https://www.torproject.org/), [Tails](https://tails.boum.org/about/), etc. to better protect their privacy.

We would also like to distribute stickers that people can put on their cars

We plan to heavily promote the event on social media and also send press releases to every local media outlet

We want to make sure everyone at the rally is on the same page. What do you think of these?

* Nonpartisan - use discretion

* Focus on this issue - please no signs

* The issue is the Fourth Amendment violations stemming from the Patriot Act -- violations of privacy -- search &amp; seizure -- right to be left alone

Dear Friend

 

Thank you for writing to me with regard to the NSA intelligence programs.  It is extremely important that we ***strike the right balance between protecting the privacy of individuals while also protecting our national security.***  

In doing so

are given ***full consideration*** (not protection.. got it) 

and that we protect the Constitutional right of due process. (but forget about protecting the 1st 10 Amendments...) 

 

I have always been a ***proponent of transparency***

within the government and I can assure you that this belief extends to the gathering of intelligence. As a matter of fact, but I will take a politicans word for it that it is in the best interest of the American people, which least be honest... it probably isnt...)

&gt;Whereas:	The Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of The United States of America states, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, and particularly describing the place to be searched

&gt;Whereas:	Publicly available information about the PRISM program

&gt;Whereas:	Our duly elected representatives within the Federal Government have taken no steps towards responding to

&gt;Whereas:	The actions of domestic spying and broad electronic surveillance by the NSA pose a major breach and violation of Fourth Amendment rights guaranteed by the Constitution of The United States of America.

&gt;Whereas:	The Declaration of Independence states, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.”

&gt;Whereas:	The Declaration of Independence also states, therefore, be it 

&gt;Resolved

&gt;1.	A broad based drag net seizure and storage of every individual citizen’s private electronic data is a violation of the Fourth Amendment of the Constitution of The United States of America.

&gt;2.	Such a violation is intolerable to the people governed by this Council.

&gt;3.	It is the duty and responsibility of our duly elected Federal Representatives to act appropriately on behalf of the people to stop this gross violation of Fourth Amendment rights.

&gt;4.	It is the duty and responsibility of officials within the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania to deliberate and

&gt;5.	The people of the Jonestown area are guaranteed to be secure in their persons, and effects against unwarranted searches and seizures, as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States of America.

I figured I'd make a post for people who might be interested. It outlines some technical approaches and tradeoffs I make to retain some semblance of privacy in this modern Internet Age.

Our current administration has made it abundantly clear they could care less about the constitutionality of the Intel community's collection methods. For those who have been living in a cave (and ironically would then have nothing to fear from this)

The full extent of these programs is slowly being revealed, they can retroactively analyze what they have collected. It's a major loophole, but it works.

What's worse is many of the tech giants (Google, only pretending to care when a national PR embarrassment is thrown in their lap.

So to the point

There's a great site I discovered from Hacker News: [Prism Break](http://www.prism-break.org). It outlines many solid alternatives for web services and computing tools that are unlikely to cooperate with Prism for a long time (if ever). As with most software

This post is about some of the recent changes I've made with respect to Prism-Break and my own research on Hacker News, and many of my decisions actually err on the side of usage, despite the tone of this post.

**Web Browser**:

I recently switched from Google Chrome back to Firefox. I always liked Chrome because of how quickly it rendered pages, Mozilla Firefox has stayed very competitive with them. There is a negligible performance drop off, but it's barely noticeable and nothing significant. You can't really trust Chrome unfortunately, even with aggressive privacy settings (no analytics, etc.) .
Firefox is not as malware/exploit bulletproof as Chrome

**Web Browser Add-ons**:

Not exactly a browser add-on

I pay $80/year for an [OpenVPN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenVPN) subscription to [Mullvad](http://www.mullvad.net)

The OpenVPN standard encrypts all outbound communication from the originating device using layer 2 SSL. Traffic appears as normal HTTPS.
This is different than other VPN technologies that use with IPSEC, which is often slower. Mullvad is fast enough that I've just gotten in the habit of leaving it running at all times.
Plus it never get old having sites show me geo-aware ads in Swedish.

The trade off is it's a bit more expensive than many of the web proxy providers. However

The fact that traffic is difficult to distinguish between secure web browsing and OpenVPN has made it an attractive countermeasure to the great firewall of China and other censorship technologies. There is a constant leap-frogging battle between those governments and OpenVPN vendors like Mullvad. It's reminiscent of the old PC gaming piracy protection vs. CD burning wars before everyone started using Steam.

**Web Search**:

I have configured Firefox to use [StartPage](https://www.startpage.com) as my default Search engine. They have a similar don't-give-a-fuck privacy policy to Mullvad (they're in the NE), it hits the mark. There is an extra half second of latency in the response, but I can deal with that.

They have a plugin for Firefox
A) opening a new tab
B) typing 'about:config'
C) Searching for the property 'keyword.url'
D) Change it to 'https://www.startpage.com/do/search?ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;sourceid=navclient&amp;gfns=1&amp;q='

**Maps**:

You're basically screwed here. Nothing works like Google Maps. They are echelons past their competitors. I can say that having used OpenLayers and ArcGIS for some technical work in the past. Plus we all remember how good a job [Apple did with their iphone 5 maps](http://gizmodo.com/5945082/apple-knows-apple-maps-suck-right-now-but-says-itll-get-better).

Just make sure you're not logged into your Google Account and preferably running OpenVPN when you do your search.

**Instant Messaging**:

This is the first example you'll see where I lean more in the ease of use than the security.

When I'm going to run IM

Mainly because it would take too much effort to convince all my friends to use to a protocol that allowed true point-to-point encryption that's off the record. I use SSL between my host and the GTalk server, your chat partner may not be using it, in which case all those messages are still visible downstream in plaintext.

The only good alternative is just to stop using it so damn much. This is a work in progress for me.

**Video VoIP**:

Skype sucks. It really does. They haven't been the same since Microsoft acquired them. What's interesting is the tool was built with pretty impressive reverse-engineering countermeasures
I don't make video VoIP that frequently anymore

I would also avoid Facetime like the plague


**Social Networking**:

Not much you can do here if you enjoy the major players like Facebook. Similar to instant messaging

I personally don't have a problem with these services and think they add a lot of value. I try to keep really personal stuff off them, and rarely contribute, but that's not really good enough.

Just by having an account with some basic information and friend links, but FB gets to learn facts about me based solely on that association. I've met girls who later looked me up through FB friends and sent weird unsolicited PMs. We've all been there. Facebook, and thus the government, has access to all that shit. They even have a whole suite of [creepy analytics that can tell if you're gay](http://americablog.com/2013/03/facebook-might-know-youre-gay-before-you-do.html).

**Cloud Storage**:

This is one of the more interesting ones. There are so many choices for secure backups

I personally use per-file encryption on [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/). It's the same storage backend as Dropbox

My methods are simple but require quite a bit of micro-mangement. I run each file through a Mac OSX utility named crypt from the command line before I post it to my S3 buckets. The utility defaults to AES-256 bit encryption and is really easy to use. [This custom version](http://encryption-utilities.s3.amazonaws.com/crypt_modified.tar.gz) I modified for OSX cleans up the command entry a bit from the authors original version.

I will say there are very fancy solutions out there for users who demand a bit more.

Dropbox is really slick with file sync and ease of use

To counter this, but you need to be a bit of power user to set it up. There's also [Tarsnap](http://www.tarsnap.com/), but it supposedly doesn't handle incremental syncs well  and doesn't work on Windows. One interesting solution I looked at was using [BitTorrent Sync](http://labs.bittorrent.com/experiments/sync.html) to do cross-device backups and syncing, but I wanted something that backs up to the cloud, not just my own devices.
There really is no easy-to-use solution that efficiently synchronizes files and is secure. Dropbox + EncFS is close

**Documents**:

This one has been difficult. There aren't too many good solutions out there. I have looked at [Zoho](https://www.zoho.com/docs/) before and they offer a lot. It's hard to imagine it easier to use than Google Docs though. [Prezi](http://prezi.com/) is cool for building presentations that don't look like PowerPoint vomit.

I really don't have a good suggestion here. If this became a frequent requirement

**Media Publishing**:

I use [Imgur](http://imgur.com/gallery) for everything.

**Email Services**:

Another interesting one. If I use an anonymous service like [FastMail](http://www.fastmail.fm)

At the very least I'm not going to make it easy for them. So far I've been impressed with FastMail. The UI feels comfortably like Gmail, achieving, filtering and custom DNS. There are no ads, but it is a pay service.

**Email Desktop Clients**:

I haven't done this for quite some time. If I had to

**Email Encryption**:

I don't bother with this. 99% of people don't want to fool with it. Just like with Dropbox + EncFS for file storage

**Online Transactions**:

Sadly I still use PayPal. A lot of people are attacking this problem right now (Stripe, but I am waiting anxiously.

[BitCoin](http://bitcoin.org/en/) is a really cool technology that's gaining some traction, but the major weakness appears to be wallet security.

**Android**:

I dumped the NSA conspirator Verizon in favor of [Solavei](http://www.solavei.com/) running over T-Mobile infrastructure. This involved forcefully unlocking my phone and installing a root kit to gain superuser permissions. If you're thinking of switching from Verizon to one of their competitors, but I wouldn't wish it on other people who just want their phone to work.
I run [CyanogenMod](http://www.cyanogenmod.org/) 7.2 for my Android ROM. I have no outbound encryption through for any of the common apps (Google Maps


**Operating System**:

I run Mac OSX. It's just too smooth and efficient for technical work. I can't give it up.
Linux is nice with respect to production scenarios
I'm very careful about what updates I perform though

Dear James

  

Thank you for contacting me to express your concerns about the National
Security Administration and recent revelations about its widespread
surveillance programs.  I appreciate hearing from you.  

  

Like you
collecting information about Americans' telephone calls

voted to extend without new safeguards three expiring provisions of the
PATRIOT Act that allow the government to access medical records
calls, I joined 22 of my
colleagues in voting against the reauthorization of the FISA Amendments
Act that authorized the wiretapping of communications of foreigners who
could be communicating with an American citizen
sufficient safeguards for Americans' privacy.   

  

While we must undoubtedly provide law enforcement with the tools
necessary to keep Americans safe
fundamental constitutional rights.  We can both protect our privacy and
also maintain a high standard of national security.  

  

As you may know
Senator Mike Lee (R-UT) that would require the Obama Administration to
declassify information about top-secret court rulings that have
interpreted what type of spying is allowable under the law.  In
particular
Court has issued opinions interpreting the breath of surveillance
allowable under controversial provisions of both the PATRIOT Act and
the FISA Amendments Act.  This past December
considering whether to extend the FISA Amendments Act program for
another five years
legislation before the full Senate.  While the amendment was
unfortunately defeated
colleagues to support additional oversight of the intelligence
community including the de-classification of these important court
rulings. 

  

Thank you
me informed about the issues that matter most to you. 


**Bonamici**

Thank you for contacting me about the National Security Agency's (NSA)
electronic surveillance programs. I appreciate hearing from you. 

 

News of these surveillance programs broke when Edward Snowden
private contractor working with the NSA
to The Guardian and The Washington Post newspapers. According to
reports
cell phone customers
calls and what numbers they called.  Another program
gives the NSA access to information about non-U.S. users of some web
products.  Under PRISM
communications to be collected incidentally.  The Justice Department
has since charged Snowden with espionage and theft of government
property.  

 

It is both a difficult and highly important task to balance our
national security and civil liberties. These events provide us with an
opportunity to engage in a meaningful discussion about domestic
surveillance programs
privacy. I am very concerned
comply with federal law or the Fourth Amendment
should conduct an expedited and thorough review of these programs to
ensure the constitutional rights of Americans are not being violated.
Please know that I will carefully follow this issue and will keep your
input in mind should related legislation come before Congress.

 

Thank you again for writing to me about this important issue.  If you

Let's put the words in the faces of the public, no editorials. We don't need the frills that slant the news we're all so used to. The visceral response will be enough.

There is a line or passage which is the subject of the thread, they alert an-- again-- randomly assigned moderator, who compiles the relevant information/citations, comes up with a synopsis (perhaps each alert will need to be reviewed by many moderators), and then sends the information on to a mailing list with every possible news outlet.

Most people recoil at the idea of their emails/search history being read by the government

Occupy focused on an issue that effects the core problems of our time: the dominating power of Wall Street over democracy (including erosion of constitutional liberties)

Remember that the people suffering the worst in our society don't have email addresses.  In comparison to other social upheavals around the world

* Huge numbers:  

They didn't need to plan for a month ahead of time

* Sustained Commitment: 

Occupy had daily protests for 6 months

* Decentralized leadership:

Occupy didn't have a protest schedule, rules and organizers making big decisions, it was a group effort.  The kind of top down structure used for Rt4 made you feel more like you were working for someone elses agenda than taking action for your own.

---

First off, and should continue to shrink over the next few days until it's no longer an issue. Some of the ways we can all help with this will be brought up this evening, and feel free to bring up your own.

Moving to the topic at hand: The national organizers and the administrators of the daily IRC meetings (as well as the /r/restorethefourth moderators, in a daily thread created by a moderator just prior to 8. If you were around here yesterday, you already noticed this change (which is why ""announcement"" was in quotes), but I made this thread to advertise the change more and to discuss why it was made.

The IRC channel(s), but if you want what you discussed on record for the purposes of general future reference, I recommend at least summarizing it in the reddit thread as well, after the fact if necessary.

**Reasons for this move**

- **Not everyone has an IRC client or is comfortable using IRC.** Of course, and allows those who aren't participating directly to at least view the thread from their browser and see what's happening, even afterwards.

- **IRC is a transient medium.** Everything posted to an IRC channel is lost to you when you log out, putting everything on record would require finding another place to host it and tediously reformatting what you copied. reddit allows everything to be aggregated quickly and easily, and the OP of the meeting thread will do this by linking to and summarizing primary comments there.

- **IRC is made for small numbers of people.** Using reddit will allow us to discuss different topics simultaneously without ""interrupting eachother""

- **Openness, more people can see the decisions being made and the work being done, easing communication (and access to information) between those doing related work, and leading to a higher level of accountability and interactivity on the parts of national organizers and other coordinators.

----

**Q) What is ""Restore the Fourth""?**

A) We are a non partisan group of concerned citizens dedicated to restoring our fourth amendment rights. We come from all across the political spectrum

**Q) Why focus on the fourth amendment?**

We care about all of our rights as citizens. However, then how can we enjoy any of our other rights? 

By focusing our efforts on one issue we unite ourselves with a common purpose that brings us together regardless of our differing politics and philosophy. This allows many who would disagree on other matters to join forces and stay focused toward a common goal.

**Q) What can I do to help?**

A) First of all, [Look Here](http://www.reddit.com/r/rtforganizers) for a list of planned protests, and please support those which are taking place in your local area.

Earlier in the week, much less any sort of attributable concrete effect, and the NSA spying issue has slipped into public oblivion thus becoming a non-issue as was feared by Snowden.  Nobody knows about RT4.  It's fringe.  Doing work is pointless if it obviously doesn't work.

To me, certain people who called themselves leaders were unable to comprehend or acknowledge the fact that creating a self-determining bureaucracy is exactly along the lines of current abusive government structures and that implementing such a system alienated massive amounts of people and talent.... leaving a pool of bad ideas, illogical discourse, and lack of actionable intent.  The fact is that the RT4 movement was sabotaged by the infiltration of people who were not self-aware enough to realize that they lacked the insight, discipline, and humility to handle such a project without massively ego-tripping and losing sight of the goal.

Thus, for commercial or non-commercial purposes alike, with the exception of those who have explicitly asked permission to do so.  Whoever is now in charge of social media should take it upon themselves to ensure that the relevant material is removed from the RT4 online presence.

It sounds like we don't even try to understand why people don't like us




Definition of 'Terrorist': ""A person who uses terrorism in the pursuit of political aims""....Could Hayden or Clapper etc be considered a terrorist? They are using fear or terror to keep their political aims of power and control locked in place. They are going against our constitution



TL;DR
By definition some of our government officials and the overreach of the NSA can be labeled 'terrorists' or 'terrorism' to the American People and the world.

Thank you for contacting me about cybersecurity legislation.  I appreciate your concern on this important issue.

 

Our national security and economy continue to face increasing cyber threats from hackers, we must find innovative solutions to counter and defend against them.  As a nation, however, we must balance the need to enhance cybersecurity with the need to respect individual privacy and our economic freedom. 

 

Any cyber legislation that Congress considers must achieve this balance between security and economic and personal freedom.  Unfortunately, the ""Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act (CISPA),"" which passed the House of Representatives and has been referred to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (SSCI) for further consideration.  As Vice Chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I have thoroughly reviewed this legislation, and I do not believe it would immediately improve the cybersecurity of both the government and the private sector without also increasing the risk of frivolous lawsuits and creating unnecessary restrictions in how or what information may be voluntarily shared by the private sector. 

 

While I remain concerned that the President's Executive order, 2013, could result in more burdensome regulations that could further damage our economy and limit the private sector's innovation in responding to cyber threats, I am encouraged by the Executive order's emphasis on better sharing by the government of cyber threat information.  I will continue to monitor the implementation of the Executive order to ensure that it remains voluntary and collaborative and does not infringe upon the rights of our American businesses. 

 

I am deeply committed to working with my colleagues on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to enact meaningful legislation that not only enhances the protection of our critical infrastructure

Here she is:

There has been an unfortunate half-truth circulating around the world for the past decade: technology can solve the world’s problems. This is a partial statement

Technology like wireless heart monitors - featured in a recently newsworthy telephone company’s commercial - can help tell a doctor miles away the condition of an injured skier. This is an example of technology helping to solve a problem, people will. 

We live in a transitional time. There is a symbiotic relationship between man and machines now like never before. Because this world is new there is no existing roadmap to follow and find out how to best sustain this bond to benefit the greater good. 

This summer could be the biggest step down that road. The scheduled ‘Restore the Fourth’ protests in the United States on July 4th of this year have the potential to incite riots, confusion, and ultimately do nothing but get a lot of people hurt. The negative echoes of ‘Occupy’ are still tumbling around in the cultural subconscious (and in the very real, very new videos from Europe, South America, the Middle East, and China as fellow peaceful protestors are being shot and even killed at this very moment). Clearly, time to avoid making the same mistakes again

The biggest problem with ‘Occupy’ was that it was a more than month long campaign to “raise awareness”.  Raising awareness can be done with a single act, than the Smartphone’s and from there, the internet). Now comes the hard part, presenting solutions to the problems we’re all now aware of. 

This is where the ‘Occupy’ movements failed, and not gonna take it anymore” but that’s not how you enact change, that’s how you attract the riot police – and that’s exactly what happened. This promoted more rage at being hurt, now physically, by the government they were so jaded with, and this vicious cycle spun out of control. 
A call to all the young people (both in age and heart) who care about the future of the world: when you return to the streets, start presenting your government with answers. 

While this could be done over message boards and social media, will provide more electricity and excitement than typing alone at your computer will. The Ancient Agora of Athens should be renewed as the Present Agora’s of New York, Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco, and more. The rebirth of our democracy is the only thing on the itinerary. There will be no more detours, or pit-stop’s. It’s forward, I actually have a plan:

Instead of being bent on destruction focus more on creation. In each city willing to participate the first week of this pop-up convention should spent meeting and greeting everyone, who look like you, but believe in a radically different way of existing.  How wonderful and surprising that we all get to share this planet together. In the interest of actually getting something done, avoid petty debates and move towards like-minded people. Once some groups start to form, within those groups first, make up an awesome group name (The Bull-Moose Party has a nice ring to it) and then use the social mapping and problem solving techniques perfected by environmental workers. They have been used for everything from figuring out how to save endangered species, to where the most sustainable place to build a bridge will be. These techniques (outlined in [Tim W. Clark’s The Policy Process: A Practical Guide for Natural Resources Professionals](http://books.google.com/books?id=7wcQS5vp3lcC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=tim+clark+social+mapping&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RDmEDX2X6_&amp;sig=jl9fkz6kcI7M3HQCVnmSScV2NNI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Us2_UcmaD5Sh4AOovIGIDw&amp;ved=0CGEQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tim%20clark%20social%20mapping&amp;f=false)) can be used to solve any problem, or how big or small. The map is a universal input system fitting any problem and the book outlines how to weigh the problems and solutions presented for best fit while maximizing functionality and maintaining the goals set out by the group. These meetings may happen at night, just leave the frilled shirts and tricornered hats at home. 

People who have graduated college in the past ten years are part of the most over educated generation ever – this exercise will be very natural for all of you, pop some ibuprofen and welcome it in.

Next, it’s time to invest back in us – because you will not just be speaking to the members of the Restore movement in your own city, but in every city across the country. Big blue box store, donate some loud speakers, a PA, a podium, and a projector screen. Smaller mobile company’s: seize the moment and create free hot stop network. Streaming sites, and don’t forget the cameras. A timetable can be set up on a social media site -like reddit - where each city will have either a few hours

Chances are there are people in each city who will think the same and maybe get up and say similar things that have already been said before in other cities. Great! Again, or poli-sci friends, or use the internet to figure out how a bill becomes law and start drawing them up.  But don’t stop their, maybe you idea fits better with NGO’s, or established businesses, non-profits that may have leverage, and even state or government grants – if our elected officials aren’t going to help us fix the world they can at least pay us to do it! The next few days should be spent on cross-city collaborations through the internet, again using social media to outline timetables. This should be the presentation of the concrete solutions to the problems each group has decided to tackle. At this point some mergers between groups could occur

The goal of “Restore the Fourth” is to come away with concrete ideas for solving the problems facing us today. We have all done similar exercises in the classroom multiple times in our educational careers – now the simulation is real, business ideas, plans, viral campaign’s and whatever else that’s been created to the appropriate place and people who can take them to their respective next step, pack up your tents, clean up your trash, and head out. 

This is as far as I’m willing to predict. Follow-ups will obviously have to happen on all accounts

I look forward to contributing to the first national conversation on the future of our civilization; with good people and good technology we can have a better life for everyone on the planet. We just need to slow down and start talking about ‘how’ instead of yelling about ‘why!?’

Obviously, regardless, especially for those who may have never protested before (and there will be quite a few of us who haven't).

**How to prepare for a protest** 

**(Weeks before)**

-LEADERS: Contact city council in order to make sure that you are ABLE to protest

-Schedule ahead of time. Tell your boss whats happening

-Prepare for a 72 hour incarceration

-CONTACT OTHERS AND INSURE YOU ARE PREPARED AND COMMITTED (Most vital info)

-Buy and create protestor/anti-riot kits (see below) to be prepared for shitstorm.

-Print off any pamphlets and signs for yourself

-Get in contact with those who are going to the protest. Remember: This isn't a fucking /b/ protest. Staying anonymous may not be an option

-If its a 24 hour protest, necessities.


**Week of protest**

-Make sure you are not coming to a protest with any warrants (common sense).

-Leave all weapons at home or in your car. Lock your fucking doors.

-Once again

-Plan your hotel lodgings. Do it on a day by day basis in case of incarceration.

-No fucking hippy clothes


**Day of protest**

-Dress politely.

-Contact leaders.

-Distribute pamphlets.

-Receive item of identification from leaders in order to prevent police infiltration of peaceful protest (CRITICAL). Armbands preferred.

-Bring anti-riot kits

-Remember the cause. Remind people of the cause. Keep on the same page, or refer them to the appointed speaker. (Prevents media clash)

-SPEAKERS: Know what to say, and DON'T GIVE THE MEDIA ANYTHING THEY CAN USE AGAINST YOU.


**Anti-riot Kits** (DO NOT USE DURING PROTEST

-Antacid spraybottle formula to nullify mace and pepper spray.

-Baklava mask

-Eye-covering lenses or goggles. If you wear glasses

-Bandana that can be quickly soaked in water (to place over mouth/nose to nullify mace). You may need to practice breathing while wearing one of these.

**Anti-riot Control tactics**

AMAZING LINK

Congratulations! Your once peaceful protest has completely and utterly escalated into an all-out shitstorm!

How can you recover?

-Reaffirm with your colleagues and fellow protestors.

-Discourage IMMEDIATELY any and all looting.

-Gather into numbers and try to remain calm.

-Stand strong

-YOU MAY NEED TO BECOME A LEADER. GROW A PAIR AND BE ONE.

-Herd cats and continue to remain peaceful.

-KEEP AN EYE FOR POLICE INFILTRATORS. KNOW YOUR FELLOW PROTESTORS FACES. KEEP YOUR IDENTIFICATION ITEMS ON AT ALL TIMES. REPORT TO LEADERS IMMEDIATELY IF ITEM IS MISSING/STOLEN. SHUN ANY AND ALL WHO ACT VIOLENTLY TO RIOT-CONTROL.

-If its a matter of life and death

With Holder's open letter promising to treat Snowden in a civilian court and without torture (sad that has to be said), the *right* of juries to nullify is a much more contentious issue. Since 1895 (United States v Sparf) the courts have ruled that informing jurors of their power to do so is not required of judges, and in the vast majority of cases they have acted to actively suppress its practice by informing juries that their only job is to judge according to the instruction of the law, and not the law itself ([source](http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/zenger/nullification.html)).

The point of this long exposition is to ask: if Snowden acquiesces to extradition, he will be found guilty. If, however, there is a campaign to educate the public on this power with regard to this case beforehand, it might provide a legal remedy to his lawful but unjust prosecution.

**On Jul 16, &lt;Maria_Cantwell@cantwell.senate.gov&gt; wrote:**


Dear Mr. [lastName]

Thank you for contacting me regarding the National Security Agency's surveillance programs. I appreciate hearing from you on this matter.

On June 8, and the Obama Administration acknowledged, that the National Security Agency (NSA) is collecting data associated with millions of American citizens' phone records, including phone numbers, locations, and duration of calls. Additionally, reports revealed the existence of the NSA's ""PRISM

I find these reports deeply troubling. On June 12, an independent agency created by Congress, charged with conducting oversight of the Executive branch to ensure its actions balance the need to protect our nation's security, while preserving individual privacy and civil liberties. The letter requests that the Board determine whether the NSA's actions were conducted within the authority granted by Congress and that the necessary precautions to protect the privacy and civil liberties of American citizens under the U.S. Constitution were taken. Additionally, I am looking very closely at legislation that has recently been introduced to address concerns as a result of this data collection. 

In 2008, concerns over civil liberties protections. On December 28, 2012, I voted against final passage of the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012 (P.L. 112-238). I had significant concerns that this bill did not adequately protect the constitutional rights of American citizens. Furthermore, the bill gives federal agencies authority to continue warrantless wiretapping programs, which allows for eavesdropping on communications and review of emails without an open warrant process. Despite my objections, the FISA Amendments Act was passed by the Senate by a vote of 73 to 23, 2012. 

As you may know

I believe we must take necessary actions to defeat terrorists both overseas as well as here in the United States. We must also stop those here in the U.S. who are helping terrorists overseas

I believe we can protect both our national security and our civil liberties. To do that there must be oversight of government and anti-terrorism programs to ensure that civil liberties are indeed protected.


Sincerely
Maria Cantwell 
United States Senator

According to documents released in the press, approved at least one request that Verizon provide the FBI and National Security Agency (NSA) with select call log data for Verizon customers. The FBI claims the data collected and shared includes routing information such as originating and receiving phone numbers, individual mobile subscriber numbers, calling card numbers, and the time and duration of each call. It does not include content of the call, or the personal location or identification information of customers.
 
The FISC was created in 1978
 
Thank you also for sharing your concerns regarding the National Security Agency’s (NSA) data collection program “PRISM.”
 
The Director of National Intelligence (DNI) recently confirmed reports that the NSA has used a classified computer system known as PRISM to collect foreign intelligence information. The system contains communications of foreign citizens located abroad that have been collected by internet service providers and delivered to the NSA for analysis. The DNI also released a public fact sheet about the program. It is available at: http://1.usa.gov/1bhNPkX.
 
PRISM’s information gathering falls under procedures that were passed in the FISA Amendments Act of 2008 (FAA) and extended by the FISA Amendments Act Reauthorization Act of 2012. While the internet service providers subject to information requests have not been confirmed
 
I fully support efforts to protect our nation, the extent of information about U.S. citizens that was gathered, and the length of time that the information was kept on file, must be addressed.
 
It's critical that we find a balance between security and freedom. Protecting our national security is critically important, the FISA amendments in 2008, and the extension of Patriot Act provisions in 2011. I will continue to support measures that protect our nation from terrorism while also reforming the most dangerous parts of this law to protect our civil liberties and constitutional rights.
 
I will continue to closely monitor this situation as additional details about both incidents come to light. Should any legislation related to intelligence gathering and our civil liberties come before the Senate

Before I start


If you don't already know me, I am acting as the interim National Director. Anna aka veryoriginal078, is taking a brief hiatus due to stress and personal issues. We had a discussion where I suggested I take her place, and I then spoke with the other national organizers to confirm that this was okay. I received a yes from 3 (Anna, Yusiye, and Bipolarbear0, and was not able to reach 1.) This resulted in a 4/5 in favor of me briefly substituting for Anna in this position. I would like to make the best out of this situation while I am here.

Let me provide my credentials. I am 32 years old and I work as a DOD contractor. I have done so since 2004 in several different countries including Iraq, Germany, Djibouti, Tanzania and Italy. I have worked in the IT Industry since 1998. I am currently working as a Cyber Operations Security Analyst for a Federal Contracting Agency (NOT the NSA.) I have a clearance and I am familiar with security protocols associated with the subject matter we are working with in this movement. I have worked as a network security analyst help desk admin, systems administrator, and help desk lead/supervisor in the past.
I am currently attending school to obtain a degree in Computer Information Systems/Network Security.

I began a group for ecospiritualists in Colorado Springs in 2007 and ran it for approximately 5 years. The group had around 500 people at any given time with a lifetime membership between 1500-2000. Shortly before the group broke apart due my absence (I had to move) the group was working on 501c3 status. During the time I was there, hosted the events, and other similar duties to what I have done here for RTF

We (local and national organizers) are voting on the long-term members of the board on Tuesday, and it proved to be very useful during that process. Since we have many important issues to tackle this week, I thought it would be helpful to begin using them again, for a short period of time. I will try to break them down into categories, if possible.

**Long-Term Volunteer/Intern Positions**

As you know, we need help from volunteers. Currently, we have several positions open. Here is a list of some. Please understand that for the time being, these will be volunteer positions. This may or may not change in the future. Either way, it's great to have on your resume and you're getting in on the ground floor. 
Here is a list of some of the positions needed. For an explanation of what is required

Only QUALIFIED candidates will be considered.

* Lead Graphic Designer 
* Graphic Designer 
* Human Resource 
* PR Directors (Work as a PR team) 
* Social Media Directors (Work as a Social Media team) 
* Marketing Director 
* Fundraising Director 
* Senior Copy Writer 
* Copy Writers (2-3) 
* Local &amp; National Coordinator (Responds to local requests) 
* Accountant 
* Legal Counsels 


**Local Organizers**

We need the input of established local organizers in our Tuesday meeting this week

We need long-term local organizers in several locations. If you are interested in being a local organizer, and we will help you, or point you in the right direction.

Local Orgs- We would like to help you gain supporters and help you build coalitions with other local organizations! Please let us know if you need assistance.


**1984 Day**

1984 day is Sunday


Quick Edit: Anna will be back following her vacation.

I would like to tackle as many of these issues today as possible. I would also love to hear your input here

Thank You
Andrea O'Neill

Some of the movement pictures and video I was seeing was downright sad.  In previous years I had engineered spontaneous protests with my classmates which had better turn-outs.

Here's what needs to be done:

* **GET A CENTRALIZED SPOKESPERSON AND LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE.**  Now I know other countries don't have this, etc they have legit opposition parties lumping themselves together.  This movement AFAIK has no backing from opposition parties.  Having no central leader only works if you have actual working/efficient subgroups.

* **BLOCK COMMERCE.**  Don't march down random streets on a holiday.  March down the highway.  March down the freeway.  Guaranteed the news will cover it and you'll slow down commerce.  It's aggressive yet peaceful.
* **MARCH ON CAPITOL BUILDINGS + HOMELAND SECURITY BUILDINGS + ANY GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS.**  This point is moot when you choose a huge national holiday when everyone has the day off.  But during a normal week this can be effective.
* **GET ACTUAL SPEAKERS
* **BRING PICKET SUPPLIES.**  Bring markers and poster-board to your marches or whatever.  It's cheap and passerby can get involved.
* **DONT MAKE COMPLEX SIGNS.** If I can't read your sign from a good distance in 7-10 seconds then you're doing it wrong.  Collages of words on Thomas Jefferson's head is fucking stupid and doesn't bring the issue to light.
* **REACH OUT TO INTEREST GROUPS &amp; LOBBIES.**  There are a shit-ton of internet freedom/privacy groups and companies which support the idea.  Reach out to them.  Get some cash from them.  Get some keynote speakers from them.  Build a network with the SOPA opposition groups of days past and others.
* **SHOW EXAMPLES OF HOW DATA IS TAKEN ETC.**  This kinda falls under like protest art but make it clear what data is being taken on fliers or when you talk to people.  It isn't just internet data.  It's credit card transactions, it's the movies you rent, it's the books you check out.
* **DO NOT SHOW UP FOR WORK.** Again
* **SPAM NEWS AGENCIES.**  Call and email and call and email and call and email again.  Set up interviews with sympathetic sites.  Get your spokesperson out there on TV or viral video.

1371587804.0,1glx8a,Proposal for Rule Changes and Clarifications,,29,14,14,"*Reason for rule change*
----

We propose the following changes to our community guidelines in the interest of greater transparency regarding moderation policy. Recent concerns about moderation have made it clear that these policies are neither well understood nor consistently applied. We hope these new rules will help provide the community with greater awareness and structure. In addition to these changes our moderation team is taking steps internally to assure our mods remain professional and will meet our community's standards. We welcome all constructive feedback on these guidelines and we will make revisions with the community's suggestions here in mind.


**Existing rules are as follows**

&gt;1. We do not advocate or support violence or unlawful behavior in any way.  Any posts or comments which fail to meet this standard shall be removed.  Should you encounter them
[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1fzmj2/any_posts_or_comments_which_incite_advocate_or/)

&gt;2. No posts (comments are fine. everyone is entitled to their own  personal opinion) which are not directly relevant to this movement. That  means no Anti-Obama, no  Anti-Libertarian, etc. Nothing that could be seen as polarizing, or that  could create the false impression that this subreddit is politically  leaning in any particular direction. There are plenty of other  subreddits that can be used for that purpose.

&gt;3. Do not make posts which are unnecessary and push down legitimate  posts. This isn't about getting internet points. If there is a post made  about a particular organizer trying to get support, there will be a LOT of posts related to  specific upcoming events in different areas, and it is very important  that everyone is able to see them. 
[Source](http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g75ca/restore_the_fourth_announcement_and_proposed/)


**New Rules are as follows**

     These will replace the rules above.

**Your submission will be removed if it:**

* Is Off Topic


This includes but is not limited to distracting jokes, or memes.
Submissions should be thoughtful and relevant to the cause or ideals of Restorethe4th. 

**Your comment or submission will be removed if it:**

* Promotes Violence


We are an explicitly *non-violent* movement

* Is Uncivil


Remarks that are bigoted or incendiary are divisive and not welcome.
We try to be inclusive to everyone who supports our cause and do not condone speech that harrasses or belittles others.

* Violates Reddit's 
[Rules](http://www.reddit.com/rules) or [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/wiki/reddiquette)

In the interests of maintaining a positive environment we seek to align ourselves with the site-wide guidelines put forth by the greater Reddit community.

**Spammers and repeat offenders will be banned without notice.**
