Sometimes, Backpacker, I feel like there's an obsession with special gear and clothing designed for ""improving the outdoor experience"". Yes, if you're a hiker you need various items, and if you're a biker you need a decent bike, a helmet, and maybe some other things. However, and sometimes when I come across other bikers I get the impression that they think I'm a chump for not having fancy bike clothes. 

Don't get me wrong, I do have a fancy running t-shirt too, though I found it in a bargain bin somewhere. If it's dirty I just wear an old t-shirt).

* How much water should I carry? My dad had ""platypuses""

* What are some essentials to keep in your pack? We had an ""oh shit kit"" in our packs for emergencies. It had water proof matches, etc. I still have my kit, just not the shit in it.

Years later, and I want to try to connect with the great outdoors once more - via backpacking and camping specifically. I'll try not to bore you with more details about my family history as it pertains to the outdoors (there is some, my mom's side is from Minnesota and from what i hear, camping was a big deal to them), and instead get straight to it: How do I get myself started? I'd like to be able to go out hiking, spend the night - possibly more than one - and then come back home without breaking a leg, or getting eaten by a bear.

My problem in that specific area is that I know nothing about camping and hiking. I know even less about what gear is involved.  What kind of gear do I need for an overnight hike that would be sufficient enough for it not to be a complete disaster? Would it be possible to get it at a modest price? (I'm a poor college kid!)

I am going into my senior year and one of the privileges that comes with being a senior is you get to plan and lead a Spring Break trip.  Spring break trips are usually the best trips we offer and consist of 9 days to some awesome location.  We are based out of North Carolina and the only limitation is that we have to be able to drive to the location (less than 20hrs).  In the past we have done trips such as Backpacking in Arches National Park, but I also want to make the trip reasonable so that we can offer it to students that have little to no experience.  I am big into whitewater and climbing so I would love to incorporate both of these into a week long trip somehow even if it is just base camping.  I would prefer to go west of North Carolina but going all the way to colorado isn't really an option. Does anyone know of any cool places to go that are a reasonable distance away?

Things I already know for sure.  We'll have a sat phone and will each be carrying a Duluth pack.  Most of our food will be what we catch and find

What other options are there? What are the correct terms for these activities?

Where do people stay? Which resorts? Do you have to pay to camp there? Do you need any training?

Where do you keep up with your hygienes? Do you carry 6 months worth of water in the pack (I doubt it)? Where is the water supply? Can you shower anywhere?

Where is the food? I've heard of dehydrated meals; does everyone use these? Do you take food from the wild? I'm not looking to go on a hunting trip.

I'm looking to spend between 8k and 11k. The ideal vehicle would get decent (20mpg+) gas mileage when I'm driving around town, climbing, and backpacking trips. A bonus would be room enough to sleep two people in the back. 

My initial thoughts are a Subaru Outback or a small SUV like a Honda CRV. A small truck (like a Toyota Tundra) with a shell on the back could be an option

TL;DR: I busted up my ankles long ago. Everything but my running shoes causes ankle pain. Should I get boots or stick with running shoes for backpacking?

Full story:

Three years ago I try to jump across something and land terribly. My ankles are severely sprained. I keep trying to ""run through it"" (I'm an idiot) for a while until I finally end up taking several months off.

I run a lot, it gets less frequent.

Then I get a new pair of running shoes. Pain goes away almost 100%. Realize that wearing my sneakers or work shoes causes ankle pain. Awesome!

I did a weekend backpacking trip in my beloved running shoes

So

Should I get boots

If I get boots

First, 160 at most muscle mass).

I'm not a fisherman and will never fish out of the boat.  I need a boat that I can solo or tandem with my girlfriend (who is even more green than me) and/or my German Shepherd (who loves the water).  I am primarily interested in class I or II rapids but would like to be able to do a little bit of everything in it (I know no one boat is perfect at everything, bike camping, and a little backpacking and would like to get some of the benefits of the first 2 with the nature of the last one.  I also like to swim, and like some of the hybrid yaks and SOT's because you can get back in from the water and use them as swimming platforms.

I don't mind a learning curve and am an avid outdoorsman and biker

As far as paddles go

I'd prefer not to spend over $2

Boats I've considered: Nucanoe, Old Town Penobscot 16 rx, Old Town Charles River RX, Liquid Logic remix xp 9 (for single use someday), and would consider any others

Any thoughts on other functions which could be useful? Obviously as I want to use it in races with navigation in GPS is not allowed.
