**Part One: The Setup**

----

If someone had sat me down and told me, that I would soon have nearly *five hundred* games in my account, I would have been downright joyous.

Five hundred games! Five *hundred* games! So much delight! So much joy! So much to play!

But

I decided a while ago that I wanted to ""clear"" my backlog. It wasn't an instantaneous decision, but it was more of a decision made out a sense of dread that weighed on me over time. I would play the games I had, and I was actually even pretty good about playing games that I ""needed"" to try out instead of dumping time into the same games over and over again.

But the problem was that the rate at which I was buying games far exceeded the rate at which I played them.

For some reason

*Beyond* plenty.

Like *five hundred*.

Steam certainly didn't help, that over there too! It was all so cheap that I didn't feel guilty, as it was easy to convince myself that ""I'd play it later"", in this sort of ideal future when I have all the time in the world to catch up on things I'd bought and then cast aside. It was also easy because it was so cheap -- I'd be practically *foolish* not to pick up that former $60 game at this single digit price.

But it wasn't Steam who rocketed my library count through the roof so much as it was bundles. They were my weakness. For the price of what *one* game was going for on a steep Steam sale, as everyone did, with the Humble Bundles. They were high quality and committed to things that made me feel good for pretending to support, like DRM-free releases and Linux compatibility. Then came Indie Royale, which highlighted smaller indie games but, most importantly, always had one or two Steam keys per bundle, which felt trashier and less polished

At the beginning, as we all know, Steam is *forever*. I was playing lots of new games and acquiring lots more. It was great to be me.

But slowly, the more I felt compelled to *keep* buying, because it felt like if I stopped, I'd miss out.

There was a point at which I realized that I was spending more time reading about games and sales online than I was actually playing games. Seeing a new bundle hit /r/gamedeals was nothing short of *thrilling*

There was another point, I stopped seeing individual games and instead saw a giant amalgam of things I'd never played in a quantity I could have never predicted. My library was the convergence of no-drop-feels-responsible-for-the-flood thinking and frog-in-a-frying-pan behavior, and it went from being something I was proud of to something I was ashamed of.

Instead of reveling in my immediate access to hundreds of games, as long as it was cheap and had Steam keys. It said I had issues in real life for which buying games was my remedy. It said that I would continue to make the same mistake over and over again, despite being acutely aware of what I was doing. I felt judged by people despite having nearly nobody on my friends' list and a profile that I'd made private out of shame. It wasn't that anyone was actually judging me, but it was more of an ""if they knew"" kind of thing, where the moment ""they"" saw the number of games I had ""they'd"" immediately know how vulnerable and foolish I was.

And

Which made me feel worse

Unfortunately, and I would often feel guilty for playing a game I enjoyed and had played for a while when there were so many that I hadn't even touched. It felt like I should have been spending time with them instead. Even when I wasn't playing games, I felt the shadow of my backlog behind me. I looked at any free time as hours that were best utilized by sinking them into my massive library. I often sat through social situations flummoxed at how much *time* I was spending *not* putting time into my Steam library. Four hours of hangout time was time that I could have spent beating an indie game! And when we'd play something on console, I'd secretly lament that the time ""didn't count"" because it wasn't counting towards any sort of Steam completion. It didn't matter if I was having a legitimate blast, because when it was all over, it still ""didn't count"" towards that unattainable, idealized goal I had always had for myself: to actually play the games I bought.

Sometime last year I started making a good-faith effort towards playing the games that I had. I still had in my mind the false notion that I could ""complete"" every single game in my library; it was just going to require *lots* of dedicated effort on my part. I would sit down with a game, often choosing easy, small indie games that were completable in a few hours. And it went like this for maybe fifteen or twenty games, at which point my idealism broke.

If a game took me, then the remaining 250 or so games would take me 1250 hours. That's not that much, right? People regularly have more time than that in Team Fortress 2 and Counterstrike. And that's a mere pittance in World of Warcraft, right?

I broke it down: if I played nothing but backlog games for eight hours a week, right? What if I played 10 hours a week? Two-and-a-half years. Okay, twelve? Only two years. That's better. Still a lot though. Let's go for the gold: what about a whopping twenty hours a week?

*Over a year*.

Twenty hours a week is basically a part-time job. On top of my regular full-time job, but that was only if I played *nothing* but backlog games. For 20 hours a week. And that was only if they all landed at a length of somewhere around five hours, which was a tenuous assumption to say the least.

Doing the actual math was humbling

It was at that point that I dropped the idea of ""completing"" my backlog, there were plenty of games I'd played that I *didn't* want to complete. I'd stopped them because I didn't enjoy them, because they flat out didn't work, or because I'd gotten bored of what they had to offer.

So *completing* games was an unfeasible goal

Somewhere, that was still a substantial amount of time, but even at a low 8 hours a week, it would take me roughly half a year. What I wanted to do was give each game an hour of my time, let it offer me what it had to offer, and if at the end of an hour I wanted to keep playing, I would. If I didn't, I could move on from the game with the satisfaction of knowing that it wasn't for me

I wanted to do it because I felt I ""owed"" it to those games, and just ignoring it wasn't an option somehow. As much as I tried to just forget that it was there, I was constantly reminded of it.

But I really wanted to do it so that I could break my bad habits. Like parents who catch their kid with cigarettes and force him to smoke the whole pack so he'll hate it and never do it again

----

**Part Two: The Process**

----

In looking to ""clear""

* Each game's time counter

This was for practical purposes

* If I liked a game

It's sad that this had to be a rule for me, in this case, a year). The problem with this was that I legitimately *did* want to play, to completion, a lot of the games in my library. I'd just never gotten around to them, especially the ones that required larger time committments or moved at a slower pace. Before this whole ""clear my backlog"" project, it was hard for me to put more than two or three hours in most games, at that point

* I could idle to an hour only if the game didn't work

This rule kind of sounds like cheating, even after finishing I wouldn't be satisfied that I'd really done what I set out to do. I'd just feel guilty about cheating my backlog clear, rather than guilty about the backlog itself. Furthermore, the idling rule wasn't one I actually set out with, but one that came about partway through the project as a practicality. Some games just don't run well (especially older games on newer hardware), and while I would legitimately *try* to get every game running (PCGamingWiki was invaluable for this), I wasn't about to burden myself greatly for not playing games where that wasn't possible.

I also wasn't going to frustrate myself for a full hour with a game I legitimately didn't like. But, I at least had to spend that time looking up information on the game. So, in the few cases (probably 10 or so) where I idled for the last 20 or so minutes of my requisite hour, I'd spend the time reading the game forums or looking up reviews to see how others felt about it. I hadn't technically played the game for an hour, but I had legitimately dedicated a full hour to the game, which, in my mind

Many would probably argue that it takes far less than an hour to discern whether or not you're into a game, I'd say that's probably accurate. What I wanted to accomplish in setting that as a threshold was to avoid the situation where I played a game for four minutes, didn't like the tutorial or first level or whatever, and then moved on. I've found that many games take *time* to kind of open up and show you what they have to offer, especially when the first part of the game is them laying out their story and mechanics for you. Most games, I would argue, try really hard to make us care about them

I found this to be true when I went back and tried to play the *numerous* games in my Steam library that I'd only put a couple of minutes into. In forcing myself to play them for an hour, as most of the games I played I liked *more* as I got more accustomed to them and comfortable with what they were having me do.

If I had to do it again, as it tended to be at that point where I would start idling in games I really didn't enjoy and turn to the forums in hopes someone could help me see what I was missing. It also would have chopped out at least 100 hours of game time. Again, it doesn't sound like that much, but that's four *full days* of gaming. That's over *twelve* eight-hour game weeks.

According to Steam, and it lists 472. The discrepancy in counting comes from a couple of ""games"" I opted to eliminate from the running, like the old version of Company of Heroes and playable betas for games like Defcon and Chivalry: Medieval Warfare.

Of those 472 games, but instead when I finished a particular level/conversation, or when I got to a savepoint, running me slightly over the threshhold).

If I were to say something about all of them in aggregate, games aren't as terrible as people seem to argue at large that they are. I see a lot of complaining about review inflation and ""shitty"" this or that and pet peeves and whatnot, but, by and large, most of the games I put only an hour into I didn't pursue not because they were ""bad"" but simply because they ""weren't for me"". This was further driven home by the fact that I checked the forums for almost every game I played, and there were almost always people there that legitimately loved it. Every little niche game has its own little niche following and loyalties, and while those groups can often be caustic or rabid

It was part of the problem that fed my buying habits, there are people who will individually attest to that particular game's individual quality, the amount of time they put into it, and why you should definitely get it because at that price it's a total steal. /r/gamedeals is a wonderful subreddit and I still love it dearly, but part of the problem with it is that almost *every* deal will have down-to-earth commenters giving wonderful sounding affirmations, making every sale seem like a diamond in the rough.

If I could say something about gamers in aggregate, but instead consider what they're saying in light of *what you know about your own habits*. Don't buy a game because someone else says it's good; buy it because you believe it'll be good *for you*. It's not that they're wrong or anything -- I legitimately do believe them when they say a game is good -- it's just what what's good for me and what's good for them *probably* aren't the same things.

It's a super relativist way of looking at things, without that personal lens, I was trying to drink from the firehose and buy *every* game that *anyone* said was worthwhile, for fear of missing out on something truly grand.

Now, I also played, to completion, a *lot* of games I'd been meaning to play for *years*. The ones that I either *knew* were going to be a good fit for me (The Longest Journey, Beyond Good &amp; Evil) or that I knew were ""too important"" to pass up (Half-Life 2, Mass Effect).

According to my spreadsheet, but I'm okay with ""1 in 3"", especially considering how many games I have that aren't really my taste and also considering that there are plenty of games in the ""not complete"" category that I've played and love dearly but that I can't and won't be able to actually finish (like Super Meat Boy).

Of course, and they were ones that, without this dedication, I likely would have kept putting off indefinitely, as I had for years before.

In terms of buying habits, and it was legitimately difficult for me the first time I forced myself to skip a Humble Bundle. In the few bundles I've bought since then, I've only activated keys for games I've legitimately *wanted* to play, rather than just bulking it and adding 4 or 5 games that I kind of maybe might want to play sometime in the future, perhaps.

In fact, but a game that kind of gets under my skin and stays there over time. Something I see that sparks something inside of me, and that I haven't already forgotten about two days later.

And it's a rule that's serving me well: this past Steam sale was the first big sale where I've not purchased *anything*.

----

**Part Three: After**

----

So

Well, filling every empty gap of free-time playing them, often foregoing sleep and other duties in order to get done what I ""needed"" to get done. I'll still play them, of course, but it's going to happen in a much less calculated manner and in a (hopefully) much more fun one. I'm bringing back some much needed balance in my life, and I've started reading, writing, journal entries I've written

I'm also going to change my buying habits. For a while, however, is both the fact that I end up spending *more* than I would normally (it just feels like less because the hits are smaller), and the fact that, in return for getting access to games made dutifully and often lovingly by developers, I'm giving mere pennies to middlemen.

To the first point, to go back into my accounts and find out just how much money I really have spent. I added up everything that went to Steam or the bundlers (as I, of course, *never* buy direct from the developer).

And I ended up with a whopping $1516.36.

For perspective, turns out games *were* my daily cup of coffee.

Now, that's not a ""bad"" total, coming out at a mere $3.21 per game. But it's a lot more expensive when you consider that I had to *twist my own arm* in order to play at least *two hundred* of them. What really surprised me in looking back at my account histories, however, was that I used to actually buy games at higher prices. I gave $50 ($50!) for the first Humble Bundle, presumably because I thought it was *worth that much*. Later ones I paid $15 and $10 for. Then $5. Then $2. I used to have no problem paying full price for things in the past, even considering something as low as $20 a bargain, a buck there

What had happened was that I wasn't really using Steam to buy games so much as Steam *was* the game, but I'll be damned if I don't recognize that I was executing the *exact same behavior* as players of those games, just by a different medium.

And this bothers me because it makes me feel partly like I've been taken for a sap, so many of them are made and toiled away on by people who got basically *nothing* in return from me. My buying habits, as is, aren't supporting what I want to support, and I know there are tons of indie developers out there hurting right now because of course nobody wants to buy their game unless it's on Steam, and, even if it is

I feel like, because it feels like the right thing to do from both sides. I have no issue with compensating people for their work, and I have no issue with paying out what I can to support the things I love, but for the three years I've been doing this Steam library bloat dance, I've been negligent on my part and my purchasing has been solely motivated by ""what can get me the *most* for the least money"".

I also feel like I'm going to move away from Steam. I wish I could say it's completely noble and that I want to support independent development and DRM-free games and all that, I just want to be away from a system that tracks my playtime. With Steam's cumulative counters for every game you've played, I feel like playing *any* Steam game fuels into some metagame because it's ""accounted for"". I realize that's partly self-created, as it's the metric I ended up using for my project, but that happened *because* the game-time tracking was already there. Having Steam count my time feels like the ""observation changes the experiment"" phenomenon on a personal level, and I want to be out from under the thumb of tracking every minute of my hobby. I don't do it with books, music, or movies

I also feel like I'm going to move away from them because I'm not sure I like where they're headed. The trading cards intitiative is, again, metagames your Steam library, only this time in a very deliberate way. Furthermore, it ties directly into real-world money and social progression to the point that I feel like if we saw this same behavior from any other less beloved company, you'd be seeing a *lot* more people rising up in protest. The difference is, of course, deep down inside

I had a sobering moment a while ago where I'd logged into Steam on a different computer and forgotten that I'd done that. When I returned to my main, logged me off. For a brief moment, I thought I'd lost my account to the hands of someone who'd gotten into my email or figured out my password or something, and, for a brief moment, it felt like I'd been gut-punched, as the whole ""Steam is forever"" idea works only when your account is still yours. I realize this is a flaw with Desura and GOG too, but at least with those I can keep local backups of the games I've already bought. And at least with them

It really made me rethink the whole eggs-in-one-basket philosophy I'd held to, that by limiting what I played to what was on Steam, I was cutting out huge swaths of worthwhile games that didn't have the luck or appeal to make it onto everybody's favorite distribution service. I was also limiting the platforms I was playing on, as I hadn't touched my consoles in forever, and when I did I couldn't enjoy what I was playing because it felt like I was ""wasting"" time.

But, and I'm definitely glad for the perspective that playing such a wide swath of titles has given me, but I miss playing games for *fun* or for *enrichment*. I miss the allure of waiting anxiously for a new game to come out. I miss diving into games for hours at a time instead of leap-frogging between them, anxious that I'd never play them all. I miss dedicating myself to a single title and seeing all it has to offer, loving it for its highs and figuring out just how it tries to cover up its lows. Gaming has the potential for so much joy, delight, and wonder

I do legitimately feel great for clearing my backlog. It's nice and freeing

But I also think I could have reached that point without going to such ridiculous lengths. The experience was a good way to make myself learn a lesson, but I'd also read a lot of worthwhile books if you forced me to read whatever's on your shelf. The real value isn't so much in the particular games I played but more in coming to terms with the fact that I shouldn't have to feel like it's my duty to *consume everything*. An unplayed game isn't a sin, and I'll be able to live my life comfortably even if I'm not familiar with those games that ""everyone"" plays.

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read it. I'd love to hear any questions or comments.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,
1361956400.0,19bhun,An in-depth Analysis of the Score from Portal 2,Randomtask3000,1311,238,118,"Please keep in mind that this was written for musicians


The score for Portal 2 more than just a well composed score, tonal and timbral relationships to each other, Portal 2’s score is highly reactive in a way that feels seamless, provides player feedback which is incredibly subtle yet highly effective, and has a near constant music presence which reflects the changing environment in a way which doesn't feel repetitive or command too much attention.

Conventional video game scores mimic film scores in many respects. They strive to be grand, they make use of modern and post-modern techniques in a romantic framework.
 
However
A game score has strict time limitations. Whereas a two hour film could theoretically have music for its entire duration, depending on the linearity of the game.

In a conventional modern game score, and stings. In game music, a state is a way of reflecting major changes in the game. In a stealth game, for instance, two major states might be “undiscovered”, and “discovered”. The music will then change to reflect the change in state. Games which are less linear, such as Skyrim rely more on state changes to have a reactive score (because many different things can happen in the same place).Location refers both to a game’s levels, such as Uncharted, and the “kill screen” or “game-end” music.

While Portal 2 is built from the same basic theory as the one described above, Portal 2’s score goes much further.

 
Portal 2 is a first-person puzzle platformer. What this means is that the game is in first person view, and most of these puzzles are concerned with transporting the player from the beginning of the level to the end. In Portal 2, the player must traverse an abandoned research laboratory using a portal gun which, when fired, creates 2 corresponding portals on any surface,
(i.e., they will fall through it and emerge through the portal on the far wall.)

One of Portal 2’s strongest features as a game score is it’s reactivity to the environment and to events. The point of a reactive score is to use your music to tell the story of what the player is doing, alterations to the music which is currently playing.
Some puzzles use a structure built into the floor called a ‘faith plate’. The faith plate instantly springs the player into the air

In the level which introduces the faith plate mechanic, either blending in with the background drone of machinery or simply being the background drone of machinery, it isn’t too clear which. When the player steps onto the faith plate and is rocketed to the air, a previously silent percussive musical loop begins to crescendo in relation to the player’s height. This loop is highly distorted covering a variety of frequency ranges. The distortion doesn't sound like natural harmonic distortion but rather the digital distortion which results when the amplitude of a sound is too great to be represented by the bit depth of the file. The result is that the percussive loop is aggressive and computational sounding. When the player reaches maximum height and begins to descend, the loop fades out and is subsumed by a quieter loop which continues the musical pulse but is far less aggressive. This all takes about four seconds.

The overall effect of this is intensification of the action of flying through the air. The rush of wind and the ground falling away from you is fairly exciting stuff, though often with rhythmic and timbral variations.

In a later level, the harpsichord track is subsumed by the same music being performed simultaneously on an array of aggressive electronic sounds. Because both the electronic track and the harpsichord track are playing simultaneously with the electronic track being silent until called upon by the faith plate, the electronic track can fade in seamlessly and be perfectly timed with respect to the harpsichord track.

There is another structural mechanic called the ‘excursion tunnel’. The excursion tunnel is a large translucent blue cylinder with helical waves on the outside of it

Once inside the excursion tunnel, as though floating in the excursion tunnel is a welcome break for the player from the more intense music present in the levels.

In some puzzles, allowing the player to reach new areas when it is not possible to “portal” there. The repellent gel resembles a thick bubbly blue paint.
 
In the level which introduces the repellent gel

The effect is one of elation. The constant modulation of the chords creates anticipation
Giving Feedback

The technique of altering the music currently playing in order to react to the player can also be used to give player feedback. Feedback in video games has a slightly different meaning than everyday use. Broadly, the player must always know when they’ve affected the world, and should be able to anticipate the reaction of various elements within it.
Most game feedback is visual, or sound effects. Lastly, it can be sensory, which usually uses vibration motors.

Sometimes the feedback must be represented as text on the screen. This is called the GUI (graphic user interface). While often necessary, as the player loses health, blood splatter appears on the edges of the screen. In Left 4 Dead, the screen goes black-and-white.

Portal 2’s score also gives feedback. Most crucial is it’s feedback with respect to the player’s completion of the level. In a game as mind-bending as portal

Some of the puzzles have the player redirecting a laser beam into an electric eye or cylindrical sensor, such as opening doors or raising platforms. The third chamber of Chapter 3 requires that the player direct a single laser into three cylindrical sensors. They must use portals, and a lens, called the “redirection cube”, which can change the angle of the beam.

The ambience in this chamber is quieter than most, the second of which is a major second higher than the first, and the third of which is a major second higher than the second.
Upon redirecting the laser into a second sensor (without directing it away from the first one) the same ostinato is emitted
The introduction of new patterns based on puzzle milestones is an elegant solution to the problem of representing a non-linear media (video games) using a linear art form (music.) And because the phase takes a long time to complete, the level generates this long piece of music with very little source material, which is an elegant solution to the problem of scoring a long game while staying within your budget for memory. Finally, the sweet sound of the loops helps to soothe the player from the grating sound of the laser, which makes the resulting music a reward for completing the level.  

The first chamber of Chapter 3 has multiple steps and uses all of the mechanics the player has learned so far (including the redirection of lasers into electric eyes

The music upon entering is a sparse, and is shot into the air and forward. This event is accompanied by the familiar fade-in of the aggressive electronic percussion. By the time the loop has faded out, the player has hit a wall and is in a new part of the chamber.  Nearby in this new area, a laser is being projected into an electric eye. The signage indicates that the electric eye is activating the wall. This impedes the player’s progress, so the laser must be blocked. While standing next to the laser, a non-tonal harsh synthesized loop is audible, fading out as the player gets further away from it. The player must portal to a third area to acquire a storage cube to block the laser. The cube is being playfully tossed about by a robotic section of the wall. The robotic movement is accompanied by another synthesized loop. When the player grabs the cube, leaving only the original metallic loop. With the cube, the percussive loop fades in slightly louder and more aggressively before the player hits another wall. Now the player learns that they must redirect the laser which they previously blocked to a second, the full sequence of the three faith-plate percussion cues is heard

The musical effect is of an in-your-face non-tonal electronic percussion gesture which occurs intermittently, deactivating and later reactivating the laser, etc.) Furthermore, seeing the music grow gradually more and more complete becomes a reward for the player.

I cannot stress enough the importance of this kind of feedback. In the developer commentary for Portal 2, and that they provide the necessary cues to subtly lead the player to the solution.
Mood

Portal 2’s score also supports the mood of the game. It is not merely an experimental reactive music engine, the chambers are littered with stagnant pools of water and are full of natural light.
The primary instrumentation is harp, and the encroachment of nature becomes less apparent, these more organic sounding musical loops are joined by saw and square wave synthesizers. Some of them are simply doubling the other parts (the harp for instance is doubled). Others are joined by heterophonic variations.
The effect is that the player has some sense of leaving behind the natural world as they enter deeper and deeper into Aperture. The whole tone tonality sounds mysterious

There are some moments in the game which require the player to move quickly. These sections are less puzzle intensive. This feels very different from the rest of the game which ordinarily allows the player as much time to contemplate the brain-gelatinizing puzzles as they require. The commentary for Portal talks about using mechanics the player has already learned in time sensitive situations to give a more “action movie” type stimulation while giving the brain a break from the rigors of “thinking with portals”.
In these situations, use of syncopation in the higher voices, two-chord harmonic structure. The speed of the music is an excellent cue to the player that they need to move quickly, and is also an effective reflection of the urgent feeling of the level. The music here is also much less locally reactive. If there is any reaction at all other than it starting at the beginning of the level and ceasing at the end, I can’t perceive it. But this is appropriate because these faster levels are a much more linear experience themselves. The player isn’t altering the environment much, they are simply moving from point a, to point b.

On a broader scale, with most of the electronic sounds being harsh and “crushed” sounding. At times the electronic percussion sounds so robotic, it is not clear if any of the percussive sounds are meant to resemble the components of the typical drum set, or even if they are meant to take on the roles of those component. Instead it sounds more like a collection of high and low noisy oscillations have been assembled with no deference whatsoever to drum set percussion. This affect reinforces the artificial nature of your surroundings.

The second section of the game takes place in the much older abandoned portion of Aperture laboratories, with a slightly slower attack and less brightness.  The percussion is slightly more organic sounding. The timbral language is basically the same but less extreme, so that the sounds of an acoustic drum set are just barely audible through the distortion and bit-crushing. The effect of all this is not necessarily to make the old Aperture labs feel more organic but rather to age them.

The third section has the player returning to the more modern Aperture, with a strong bass presence and strong presence in the upper register, but few middle range tones. The pieces make heavy use of low drones, some lacking a rhythmic pulse. The effect is of even greater discomfort than the first section. The player is in much greater danger than before, and these musical changes are a reflection of that.
Spoilers

I discussed earlier that music can be used to reward the player. This is especially true of the ending to Portal 2. Eventually, decides to allow you to leave. She tosses you into an elevator. You travel up a few floors, only to have the doors open and be confronted directly by an assortment of the dangerous automated machine gun turrets (with creepily child-like personalities) you spent the game avoiding. The turrets take aim, and just when the player thinks they are in for a tragic ending, the turrets begin to shyly sing in four part harmony. The elevator resumes its journey upward and the song is joined by a multitude of turrets, growing louder and grander like the finale to a romantic opera.
In video games, but when you experience it for yourself, it is a very victorious feeling.

Portal 2’s score succeeds in supporting the mood of the game, providing for reactivity and feedback while avoiding spending too much memory on music. It does all this without being distracting. The musical loops which are mixed based on proximity to an area or object fade in as the player moves towards them, meaning that there is never the jarring start of a new loop while the player is walking and not effecting the environment. Those loops which do simply start up coincide with some environmental factor which usually triggers a sound effect which hides the beginning of the loop. All of these factors make the music of Portal 2 an intimate part of the player’s experience.

- Indiana Jones kills **9** people in Raiders Of The Lost Ark

- The new James Bond

These movies are hailed (and often parodied) as over-the-top action movies. Yet every shooter game blows these numbers out of the water. Uncharted (which pays homage to Indiana Jones) asks you to kill **hundreds** of enemies in each game

Recently there have been some articles about the **conflicted narratives** created by first-person shooters like Tomb Raider and Bioshock Infinite that supposedly explore deep themes but tell them in the standard FPS form.

**[This article](http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2013/04/05/bioshock-infinite-and-the-problem-with-video-game-violence/)** has a link to many other discussions.






I saw a comment in  a review of Bioshock Infinite that defended the game's violence because its purpose is to *show the player* that **""Booker is not a good person; he's a violent man with a violent past.""** 

That seems like a silly rationalization. Infinite's gameplay

Everything about the game's characters and plot is designed to set up the firefights. That Booker is violent could be called his only *necessary* character trait. Your AI sidekick - a teenage girl - *briefly* voices a token objection to your killing spree before doing a 180 and falling in line (for the rest of the game

The clearest example of this is during the [ghost mom](/spoiler) section. [Elizabeth](/spoiler) gets to have a moment of tearful reconciliation; the player gets a boss fight. The game clearly doesn't know what else to do with the player.



One slightly amazing thing about Infinite is that it goes out of its way to keep you from doing anything that isn't FPS. There are puzzles in this game [(the meaning of CAGE, **the doors are actually *locked* to *make sure* you kill all the enemies before being allowed to progress.**

The result, and the mechanics of the game. Every time I reach a crossroads in a game, I go the opposite way I'm supposed to go in order to explore the map and (hopefully) get better loot. When I make that decision though, I am very aware that I am playing a game. I'm not going left because the character would go left, but because games have taught me that the good stuff is always down the other path. In fact, I would say it goes further than that emotionally. I can't just go down the obvious route because I will be constantly stressing out that I missed something good. In Bioshock Infinite I only used the objective arrow to find out which direction NOT to go.

Now, or is it simply what will always happen if you want to reward exploration in video games?

**EDIT:** This is a really great discussion. Thanks everyone. I have realized that Bioshock Infinite and The Last of Us may not have been the best examples of this happening, and others, have learned 2 things about games that have formed our mindset:

The tone of Fallout 3 didn't work for me at all. So, I decided to play FO3 like a true wasteland survivor and pack rat would. If I die, I die; I stop playing and uninstall the game.

By itself, there are more drugs with specific drawbacks, skill progression is slower to encourage specialization, perks are better and more diverse, hunger, thirst and sleep deprivation are issues now... and the wasteland is a harsher, less forgiving, and there are several more kinds of mutants and fauna around so you never know what you will find out there.

The most important addition is a sprint button, VATS runs in realtime and you take full damage (it was 25% or so in vanilla FO3) , and is really useful to ""tag"" multiple enemies when swamped. The game is hard now, but if you're in trouble, it's because you got cocky and overreached.

This means making safe choices. This means fending off a radscorpion at my level is harrowing, multiple interior paths are rigged with mines, every bullet is a precious resource and headshots are godsends. This means a button to lean around corners is sorely missed.

Most importantly, and I make choices driven by survival, such as refusing to do a quest that involves wading into a minefield ghost town or protecting a settlement against a supermutant onslaught. It's a strange thing: the satisfaction of clearing out a raider infested location pales when compared to the relief from skirting around it. (Sometimes I lob a grenade or two in and hightail it out of there. That's even better.)

The problem, quests to do or XP to earn. The metric of progress here has shifted to how many nights I've survived, how much easier the next day will be (I sleep at night because the nights are now dark, scary and difficult to prepare for), and even how long it will be before I can brave the journey to Galaxy News Radio to find my dad. The main quest and all the little stories, bad writing or not, have an impact now that was lacking before. Moira saying ""Be careful out there"" is not an empty platitude to click through anymore.

It's nigh impossible to be an altruist or charitable person now, but with the richness of Bethesda's world-building. There's no going back. I stand to lose a great deal by not being careful, and am significantly invested in my character now--a first for an open-world game. Permadeath has given my Fallout 3 experience something Bethesda did not: Meaning.

I highly recommend it.

**TL;DR**: Permadeath FO3 playthrough is intense, sometimes exhilarating because it gives you *something to lose*. Get some mods, then try it.

I picked World of Goo, since I figured simple physics puzzles are easier to get into -- in my mind anyway -- than shooting random dudes. But about five to ten minutes in, she kinda got visibly angry/frustrated when she got stuck on something that I myself had been stuck on for quite a bit when I played it last year. I tried to reassure her by saying it was *okay* to be stuck and she could have fun figuring it out to get that aha! moment of satisfaction at surpassing the challenge, but it turns out she was more of the mind that frustration was NOT fun at all, and why would she subject herself to that? She made the comparison that if she gets frustrated at something in the real world and fixes it, like a challenge at her workplace, but games frustrating her is basically futile and pointless exercise.

I think now I know to not have her play a puzzle game again, games ARE structured exercises in having your agency frustrated and then feeling that sense of achievement in overcoming it. Even more story-based games like adventure games have frustrating puzzles as a mechanic.

Ignoring the difficulties to log in as this is more based around the game itself. Diablo 3 had an awful launch but people were soon over the log-in problems and on to Diablo's greater flaws. Does SimCity have these greater flaws?

As a city building simulator how is it?

Does it compare to earlier titles? Sure it's missing some features from the earlier ones but that doesn't automatically make it bad (as /r/gaming seems to think). Are the smaller city plots really that bad? A giant map isn't always better

As a gaming enthusiast/programmer I am very interested in the A.I system they've used for this game. Is it like they said in earlier videos about everything being simulated properly

How is the online play? Are the online features interesting and enjoyable or just a hinderance? Online only DRM doesn't really phase me. I'm always connected to the internet and some online only games offer some pretty interesting features. Take Anno 2070 for example

I personally haven't had a chance to play it as it does not release in the UK till Friday. I am interested though but I'm finding it hard to get some real opinions on the game.

Now, broken. But after putting some thoughts on it, I found out that there is one thing that keeps coming back in today's games that always ends up rendering the gameplay pretty dull: punching bag enemies (as you could guess from the title :P)

I'm unsure as to when they started getting popular... but enemies in most recent games simply do not react to player damage and can generally be defeated with a constant stream of attacks. I'm not necessarily talking about AI issues here – the problem is that regular enemies can always be defeated simply by attacking them up-front.

Let's look at the Zelda series, bouncing backwards when they are attacked, forcing the player to kill them by pushing them down holes. [Stalfos](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Stalfos) are fairly simple but jump backwards as soon as the player swings a sword near them, forcing him to stand very close to them to deal damage. These are only examples of enemies found in this game but in all cases enemies blink and fly backwards whenever they take damage. In short, **they react to the player's attacks**.

Now, they take all the damage without flinching until their HP drops to 0. Therefore, because of how simple it is to defeat these punching bag enemies, the difficulty of these games is entirely dependent on the statistics and gear of the main character(s). Some of the simpler games also lack any sort of strategy, requiring only to stand in front of a mob of enemies, chugging potions whenever health drops low.

This issue can also be seen in a lot of FPS/third person shooters – some enemies do carry shields or have increased resistance to damage

This problem, or after starting a specific character build in RPGs), all encounters (aside from boss battles) are taken care of the exact same way – head-on, all guns blazing to the enemy's face. I can often dodge their attacks... but the enemies usually can't (or don't want to!)

I think it's a shame, meaning you have no need to use other strategies. Even if you find out how to defeat a specific enemy, putting them in different situations and pairing them with other enemies can really make fights far more intense. If you add an enemy that can block damage from the front, that's great... but what if they then spawn right next to you, in an area with barely any cover? Are you going to shoot their faces off like usual, or are you finally going to use those mines that you never had the need to use before? What about pushing them down from a platform? What if the enemy's shield can *actually* block your fully-upgraded, min-maxed +200 Fire Sword attacks?",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1cxx9z/punching_bag_enemies_one_of_the_biggest_flaws_of/

1332050047.0,r1r6k,Why Gamer “Entitlement” is a Bullshit Buzzword,JiggleBiscuits,889,320,423,"Original post here - I didn't write it

http://theparanoidgamer.com/why-gamer-entitlement-is-a-bullshit-buzzword/

A new word has been popping up a lot lately in the crazy world of gaming media. It’s a word used to devalue the complaints, in all of its insulting glory, is “Entitlement”.

You see this word thrown around constantly by all variety of gaming sites, publishers and developers that have insulted and mistreated so many of us with sickening smugness.

Take for example this video by IGN’s Colin Moriarty. This is a man who can get on camera and say that he wouldn’t see anything wrong with ME3 being 90% on disc DLC

I’m sick and tired of seeing this buzzword spread from one corner of the web to another

First of all, were entitled to be treated by law. In modern times, entitlement has taken on a different meaning and is now interchangeable with spoiled. Essentially, someone who believes that they should be treated better than others, despite the fact that they are undeserving of this treatment or have done nothing to earn it. However, I don’t believe that this concept applies to consumers.

Imagine that you’ve gone to a restaurant for a nice steak. Once you’re seated your waiter doesn’t bother to bring you a menu until you flag him down and is generally rude and impatient with you. He brings you a drink that’s different from what you ordered and doesn’t even bother to refill your drink a single time. When you finally get your steak it’s cooked twice as long as you wanted and has a nice thick hair on it that’s not yours. In the eyes of the gaming media, wrote a bad review about the restaurant on a local attractions website and then never ate there again, you would be an overly entitled eater. Which is, of course, wrong.

The above argument perfectly illustrates my point in that there is a clear difference between being a spoiled brat and simply being entitled to a decent treatment from the goods you’ve paid for.

Consumers don’t buy rotten food from grocery stores. They don’t like using services that screw them out of their money or don’t do what they’re advertised to do. They don’t keep broken electronics and other goods. If you buy a $60 appliance and it doesn’t work, play it and find that it doesn’t meet your expectations, you’re often shit out of luck unless you want to resell it for a massive loss (something you can’t even do if you purchased digitally). 

Wherein then is the gamer’s recourse? Message boards, Metacritic and countless other communities are often the only place that these people can go to give voice to their issues. Sometimes this happens in destructive and controversial ways, with threats of boycotts, public flaming of developers on Twitter, and occasionally even hacking. All of this is usually quite dramatic and exactly the sort of thing that the gaming media loves to report on, but they tend to criticize and paint the fans as rabid basement warriors, rather than trying to understand how a group of rational people could feel so out of options that their passion drives them to such actions in the first place. It’s no wonder that these controversies pop up left and right given that the gaming industry has a tendency to treat its fans in an adversarial manner quite unlike that of any other entertainment medium.

In a netscape where developers openly call people “Fucking Morons” on Twitter and casually delete complaints off official forums, lawsuits and fan movements that have brought about real changes in the way developers and publishers do business and treat their customers.

I suppose that when you get right down to it, some so shoddily done by major studios that they prompt you to hit the “Start” button on the menu screen. Where Microsoft can charge millions of gamers for peer to peer online and nobody cares. A land where it’s okay to lock away content on the disc that you’ve bought so that they can sell it back to you. Where mod tools are barely an afterthought. Where it’s policy to tack a multiplayer component onto a single-player game just so that they can charge you for an online pass. A place where it’s perfectly fine to release buggy, broken games and then rely on patches to fix them months later, or even more commonly, not at all. Where beloved franchises are gutted and turned into generic first-person shooter properties. Where the reviews are done by websites whose paychecks come from the company whose product they are reviewing. Where intrusive DRM punishes the consumer far more than the pirate. Where you can get in-game advantages in multiplayer focused titles by buying Mountain Dew.

That sad, call them out on it. Stand up for yourself, because none of these media outlets really care about your best interests and they never will. What they do care about is exclusive preview content, early review copies and ad revenue. For that reason the vast majority of these sites will always be on the side of the corporations and not the consumers.

First of all, when faced with a decision between making a little money and a lot of money, they will go with making a lot of money.  *This is normal and every business does this.  It does not make these guys any more evil.*

Yes, make the artistic statement they want at a loss of profit or even capital, but once a company is formed that has shareholders, or quarterly goals they need to hit, the profits are what takes over.

Sometimes companies do things that don't appear like they're making a profit, he is a smart and calculated businessman and capitalist.  

Call me a cynic or pessimist, and if good enough, users will buy the next game in the series even if it's shitty.  That's a good place to be.

Imagine if in your 401k or retirement account, the distributing company behind Twilight (I'm trying to pick an example I think none of you will care about).  Your money is being invested in a company that makes Twilight action figures.  The company can rush one out for a 50% profit, or spend extra time making it artistically accurate and perfect for the niche action figure market, but at a 20% profit.  As someone who doesn't care about that artistic market, you obviously want the company to rush it out to make you more money.

This example can be repeated with basket weaving or the Disney channel, there will be those indie guys who come out of a response to this.  But it's silly to comment at things like ""Ubisoft should do this this and this"" when those choices would clearly lose them profit.

Why do CoD and Asassins Creeds keep getting made every year?  Profit.  And you shouldn't bitch in the comments about how Activision or Ubisoft should change that.  They want to make money and they're doing it beautifully.  Changing their focus to please /r/games and /r/truegaming to lose money would be economic suicide.

And on a side note

Overall, Socialism, Resource based societies, etc...) and politically campaign to work towards those types of societies.  Then maybe it will be possible to have 200 guys work for 3 years on a game with your precise artistic merit.

I know you can buy some retro games legally through other means, Gameboy, Genesis, etc games that I can play on my smartphone. Why don't they want my money? It seems so easy! They probably aren't making much money off those old consoles anymore anyway.

**EDIT:**
I just want to add this

Do you guys really believe if they allowed legal means to download retro games outside of the Virtual Console that it would really affect hardware sales that much? I believe as long as they release new and popular titles on current hardware that they would still continue to sell units. If legal services were available to play NES/SNES games outside of VC

Furthermore, or 2.) I can buy the game used (which is pretty expensive). In both cases Nintendo sees no cash from me. I actually WANT to give Nintendo my money!

I think that the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series is simply fantastic because of it's unrelenting *brutality*, to put it bluntly, the brilliant *lack* of them.

First of **the brutality:**

I made this comment on this subreddit a few months ago. [Link.](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/15gto8/have_you_ever_experienced_a_moment_of_pure_dread/c7mcndy)

&gt; The games atmosphere

&gt; Seriously

&gt; Once you step outside of *any* safezone

&gt; That game really made me dread kicking up my feet and walking outside into the wild, anomalies, creatures, you just aren't safe.

&gt; I basicaly ran all he way from one safe zone to the next because there isn't any rest to be had once you're out in the open. You're constantly fighting to remain in one piece

Through out the entire game, makes you uneasy and lulls you into a sort of somber trance, is the simple fear that *everything outside can and will kill you.*

In many open world games

In The Zone however, and the only respite that you will ever see is by getting to a checkpoint with other Stalkers in the zone.

You *fear* kicking up your feet and going into The Zone, everything can kill you and you are never safe out in the open.

When i played it, to the 100 Rads Bar was nothing but constant running, gunning, healing and nothing but fear and the feeling that i had no chance. 

As soon as you leave The Cordon

One of the major reasons for this is **the atmosphere:**

The Zone is at once, untamed, terrifying wilderness. Gunshots are common and omnypresent. Helicopters often fly over, breaking the silence, but worst of all are the faint and distant roars of.... *who knows what they are.* 

But The Zone has a sort of eeire quality to it that many times, even a little depressed, and the subtle emotion upon the end of the game completes this feeling. It's a beautiful mix of loneliness and fear.

But what sets S.T.A.L.K.E.R. apart from other games is that **it lacks a level up system**:

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R; **you don't have any character attributes

Instead

Your survival depends completely on: how much ammo you have, how many weapons you have, but above all **your own skill at aiming the damn thing.**

In this way

Along with atmosphere and the pure brutality of the gameplay and survival

Fallout may be fun, there are no perks for accuracy.

Figure it out yourself. Shoot straight and don't miss.

But what i really like is **the lack of any karma system in it's modern form.**

Karma systems in modern gaming are broken and unrealistic

In S.T.A.L.K.E.R; it's simplified to the point where it's just sort of an add on

It isn't really a karma system, friend, after helping them. But that doesn't give you really any sort of perk as opposed to being evil. It's all the same.

However if you screw up and attack a faction

IMO

The karma system should be scrapped and replaced with something much more, if i can put it that way.

So yeah

**PRINCIPLE 1**

* Clear rules.  You understand why you failed

This is probably the biggest one, or dodge, or you fell off a ledge.  You know what went wrong, and you know what you need to do in order to fix it.

It's telling, which is considered the most ""unfair.""  The problem with the Bed of Chaos fight is not that you die a lot while attacking it (surely you die more at other bosses), but that the deaths you incur strain the sense of reasonableness that the game has worked so hard to inculcate.  The claws which send you to your doom just seem to come out of nowhere, without the degree of warning or pattern that you expect from most boss fights.  At least in my experience, I could watch a boss long enough and figure out the pattern and therefore plot out a course to victory.  The Bed of Chaos may have a pattern of some sort, but I could never really quite figure it out and therefore had to rely on luck to a much larger extent than in the rest of the game.  The rules weren't communicated particularly well, and that is what appears to distinguish the fight from more challenging ones

As a subpoint to this principle

* _Bad difficulty derives from gummy or imprecise controls_.

This is a common complaint, as the jump/roll that is required can be rather tricky since Dark Souls, for all the things it does well, didn't do precision rolling/jumping particularly well.

**PRINCIPLE 2**

* The challenge comes primarily from _applying_ the rules you've learned

This is actually an area where I think you can legitimately fault Dark Souls.  In a game which gets difficulty right in so many respects

Probably the most frustrating aspect of any game is dying over and over again and _not understanding why_.  The challenge of the game designer is, based on the logic of the universe presented, to solve it.

As a subpoint to this principle

* _Bad difficulty derives from the game designer expecting the player to apply the rules in an unclear or unintuitive way

Your classic example here is Simon's Quest

**PRINCIPLE 3**

* Good difficulty primarily derives from the depth of the challenge

I might be going out on a limb here, say, the Iron Golem if he was surrounded by dozens of hollows - they'd have to scale down the complexity of his attacks to compensate.  You'd end up with a cheaper, more frenetic fight that would leave you distracted half the time.

Note, where a mass of mooks is to be expected.  I'm thinking more of how fighting the dragons in Dragon Age was much more satisfying than the final battle, which stooped to the ""wave of distracting mooks"" approach.  See also:  Legend of Grimrock.

To take a slightly different example, and isn't repeated.  It's the shallowness of it that galls. 

As a subpoint to this principle

* _""Bad difficulty requires the player to repeat lengthy and tedious stretches of gameplay to return to the challenge.""_  

Again, plus the accumulation of souls added to the sense of advancement.  I'm not convinced, however, that lengthy runs to some of the boss fights were necessary.  The bonfire run to O&amp;S seemed about right, the run to Bed of Chaos just got old.

I'm sort of spitballing a bit with this topic here, because people really draw the line in different places (I'm sure there are people who love Dark Souls in even at its most obtuse).

Have you ever had a friend with whom you shared a hatred of something popular?  Maybe everyone was really into Skub

Then, and your friend doesn't seem to hate it quite as much as they did when you were alone.

Feels like a betrayal

Your friend wasn't necessarily a traitor.  They just felt the pressure of doing or saying something because it was expected of them - when you hated Skub, they felt compelled to like it, because they didn't want to seem like an asshole.  

That's a pressure that each and every one of us is subject to.  The kid downloading the latest Nicki Minaj single because all their friends are into it.  The guy who's never actually played Madden or spent time learning its mechanics to see the appeal but happily joins in the condemnation of it.  We might like to think of ourselves as lone voices of reason in a crazy world, ""it's not who you are underneath, but what you do that defines you.""

So what's all this got to do with /r/truegaming?

Well, the numbers themselves mean absolutely nothing, and I don't think anyone but the seriously naive chases some kind of high score, but it's not the numbers that matter: it's **visibility**.  People don't care about their score, but they sure as hell care about being the top comment, or on the front page, for everyone to see.  It's the internet equivalent of being popular, people can and will saying anything if they believe it's expected of them to be the most popular comment.  Do we hate Skub this week?  The top comment will be someone denouncing Skub.  Are we tiring of the anti-Skub circlejerk?  The top comment will be about that.  And it just keeps going

Again, social creatures, and we're wired that way.  When Skyrim was about to come out, I was seriously considering picking it up because everyone on /r/gaming made it sound so cool and exciting.  I began to think this was the game I'd been waiting for.  Then it came out and, surprise, it was just a game with its good and bad points.  Then I remembered that I don't actually like The Elder Scrolls, and felt a bit silly because I'd been sucked into the hype.

The important thing to remember is that this isn't indicative of people's idiocy.  It's simply the effect of holding what essentially amounts to a popularity contest, but for games.

A user reported a thread this morning, but because I thought *""god fucking damn it, aren't we over Spore yet?""*  Yeah, it was a disappointment, but fucking hell, it was just a game.  There are literally hundreds of games out there worth talking about, good and bad.  Why are we focusing on the same twenty or so

The answer, consciously or otherwise, that if we say certain things, we'll be upvoted.  We'll get to be the most popular, visible person on that page.  And so, instead of actually talking about things, Reddit becomes a race to see who can post ""Portal"" first when asked what your favourite short game is.  Or who can post ""dat ---"" first when presented with, anything.  We're not making jokes, but we'll continue to do it anyway

I can't make you guys talk about certain things, we're not about to start a campaign of deleting everything we don't agree with, because sooner or later we'll be accused of taking it too far.

1342715407.0,wtnmt,In Regards to GameStop,andreisbrandnew,683,189,336,"Let me start my saying I am an avid gamer across every platform.  For the entirety of my life

Before working with the company, I was greeted by some nice guys.  They were informed, and were genuine about their interest to help me find what I was looking for.  They asked me where I worked and I told them I worked for Pacific Sunwear but was looking for a new job because of the imminent closing of that store.  They were thrilled and offered me a position to be their Assistant Store Manager.  I thought about the position for two weeks before going back and talking with the store manager.  He hired me a few weeks later and sure enough, a few weeks later things went to shit.  

Everything that I was weary about before taking the job came true.  

If you aren't familiar with the way GS handles performance let me explain.  Employees (regardless of their position) are rated by three factors

 * Reservation
 * Power Up Rewards Cards
 * Customer Survey

Your reservation percentage is a number based on how many **NEW** reservations you received divided by how many transactions you have entered. My store was a low volume store which meant we only made around 11000 dollars a week at the most.  It also meant we did an absurd number of transactions because of the low income area we operated inside.  The average dollar sale was around $19.  That means we did around 580 transactions in a single week.  Simple math tells you that as transactions increase, it makes no sense.  

The PUR card is much of the same upsellng bullshit and I won't repeat what I said earlier. 

The customer survey or NPS was my favorite.  The hours we worked, fill out and rate their experience.  History tells us most of the time people rate anything is when they have had a bad experience.  When have you ever gone to a place of business, waited in line for 15 minutes listening to a salesman go on and on to every customer in front of you after repeatedly being shut down, hearing the same pitch presented to you and had a good experience?  


Remember those two guys that got me hired from earlier?  We were all fired earlier this week.  I know what you're thinking, peaking at number 7 out of roughy 6000.  We were the shit.  We killed it despite all of out gripes and were fired anyway.

Three managers

You see, the people that preorder shit only do it to shut up the person hassling them.  Our computer had hundreds and hundreds of preorders lost in the system.  Thousands and thousands of dollars sitting.  You may ask what gamestop does with that.  

Well, the game, and the business trend, that money becomes positive shrink for the company.  Which means free money.  Money that was earned in return of nothing.  Some people call it stealing...but hey whatever.

We were fired for taking that money, if a customer came back and said, ""Hey, what do I have preordered...I'm pretty sure I still have money in the system?"" We wouldn't say,""Nope, you don't have shit preordered but how about BLACK OPS2!!!!!""

It started with a box a Gears Of War 3.  A box worth 1700 dollars of GOW3 went missing.  They couldn't find it.  Naturally they blamed the management staff and not UPS because they have of course never lost anything.  They did and investigation and said that we had been ""Abusing our power"" with the nature of our fraudulent transactions.  I was fired for moving money back and forth in a system designed to steal it from you.


In closing here are some small tidbits you may want to be aware of.

 * If you feel like you have a preorder and ask ""What do I have preordered?"" The associate will likely say nothing so he/she does not take a cancel.  It hurts their numbers and are actually encouraged to lie to you.
 * New games that have been gutted as display cases have most certainly been played
 * The PUR card is a total ripoff.  If you are an idiot that trades in games
 * Make sure to inventory **Everything you trade in** because while it was is probably not always on purpose
 * Preorder only at **ONE STORE** if you do it.  However
 * You don't need any game knowledge to work there. Especially if you have tits.
 * They cry about losing to steam in the PC race.
 * Remember the people behind the counter aren't the company.  Those people just want a job doing something they like.  They don't like asking you to pre-order DLC anymore than you like saying no.


If anyone has any questions about the company I can answer them.  I harbor no ill will towards them, and the turnover rate is **EXTREMELY HIGH**


**EDIT**  

I wanted to clear a few things up.  

 * A few things I spoke about was largely anecdotal.  I was the ASM.  I was fired for practices I witnessed the SM doing multiple times.  He still has his job.

&gt;You don't need any game knowledge to work there. Especially if you have tits.
 
 * I said this because it's true.  Yes,SGAs,ASMs, and SMs.  Many times when I went and helped other stores, the associates had almost zero game knowledge.  I can't tell you how many times I had to step in to stop a pre-order because associate X told someone if they liked Call of Duty they would LOVE Deus Ex.  Gamers deserve to be sold games they actually want to play.  Not games that are easy to push.

For the most part, Gamestop employs all sorts of terrible business practices and justifies it by saying customers always have ""options.""

**EDIT 2**

Games are by all means, propaganda, and mis-information.  As a kid, games were a place I could go to get away from those things.  As the games grew, so did the industry.  Maybe all things started with the honest intent on providing a service otherwise absent and somewhere along the way, someone said, lets exploit this as long as we can.  Gamestop is not an anomaly.  It is not unique in fucking it's customers and employees.  The CEOs and CFOs in charge of these companies were rich before Halo and COD

My opinion has always been that if

I understand both sides.  As a business student I completely understand why I was terminated.  Again, you don't have to force it down people's throats.  People doing their jobs is something I get.

1375951595.0,1jy1f8,What great/interesting games have been ruined by one tiny design choice?,SpaceGhostDerrp,604,134,868,"Two years ago

The premise: a first person shooter game capture the flag.  It looked a lot like minecraft with guns

Since this is a capture the flag game, built by strangers, defended and maintained with no VOIP or communication.  Along with the brutally simple graphics, the simplicity of purpose and game mechanics made for many interesting game sessions.  

I remember hours-long game sessions, knock down all the supports on the castle around their flag, then steal it and return it to our base.  Games would last for hours, as castles became more intricate, and as the network of tunnels under the map grew.  One player spending 15 minutes digging around to a flank might be enough to take the enemy team by surprise; the only warning for defenders was an unnerving scratching sound coming from the ground below, as the enemy frantically dug through the darkness.  

Another interesting mechanic: whatever was on the map appeared on the minimap.  The location of the flag appeared as a red or blue cross on the minimap

Then they added the ability for guns to shoot and destroy blocks.
You could knock out the supports under a castle from a distance with your gun, so the game just became another generic FPS with terrible graphics.  Enemy fortifications could be destroyed with ease from a safe distance.  There was no need for teamwork, no strategy other than mindlessly charging at the enemy.  

Another terrible design choice: allowing custom maps.  This is the only game I can think of that was made worse by releasing mod tools. 

The original map was randomly generated.  One team would always be in a mountainous region, while the mountain team had more surface area to defend from tunnels, but had a much larger distance from the flag to the river.  

When they added the ability to make custom maps

The new map-builders forgot to make their maps more than one block thick, I believe, because this added customization attracted those who were too cheap to buy Minecraft, and did not really care about gameplay.  

There was something beautiful about the early beta.  Every character looked the same, only one shovel, only one character model.  From a simple start, you could pitch in the build a huge castle to defend your flag, or a massive system of trenches to guard the river crossings, or go to work on a tunnel deep into the mountain, under the enemy base.  

There were moments of greatness in that early build.  Imagine spending ten minutes digging a tunnel towards what you hope is the enemy flag.  You pause to turn around; the light of day forms a tiny square at the end of your tunnel.  Before you start digging again, digging in the opposite direction.  The sound is too faint to pinpoint, but you know that moving in any direction might send you spilling into their line of fire.  Of course, if you win the firefight, you will have a clear road into their base, and a quick escape route once you steal the flag.  The tension here, along with the claustrophobia of being under a mile of virtual dirt, as the last two players strain to hear the footsteps of the other player

Sadly

**TLDR: With one small update, destroyed all motivations for teamwork.  Long before it was bought out by Jagex, the game designer folded under pressure to be more like Minecraft, and added features that ruined the brutal simplicity that made the original beta builds so intriguing.**

In light of this

The following genres seem under represented as compared to console and handheld platforms:

* **Party Games** - There is not a huge market for these games as compared to other genre's but certain platforms have had a large amount of success with them, and I've found pretty much nothing to meet this need. I understand the average player doesn't have a computer hooked to their main entertainment center, but for those that do, it seems like structured party games are absent.

* **JRPGS** - This has long been a complaint of PC gamers, as we've seen a large increase in the JRPG market on handheld consoles. I'm really not sure why there's such a lack of these games as I would imagine the line up well with the ""Hardcore"" gamer types that a lot of the PC World self identifies towards.

* **Open Ended Casual Games** - I know that the PC market is over saturated with a huge variety of web/flash based games on sites like kongregate. My concern is that a web based environment doesn't offer people the same structured approach that people expect in a system like PSN, and Harvest Moon have experienced a large amount of success on their system, and I've never found anything that offers a similar experience on the PC. There are plenty of PC simulation games, but they tend to stray towards the ""Sink or Swim"" style of simulation that tasks players to micromanage lots of variables in an active time situation. I've found that this type of simulation is exceedingly stressful to me, and has the opposite effect of something like Animal Crossing, which offers a ""Latching"" style of game play where it's almost impossible for players to make negative progress. 

And while I would identify as a ""Dedicated Gamer""

As a long time PC gamer, and while I've enjoyed it tremendously, there is still a large swath of gaming experiences that don't exist in the PC market. Valve has heading in the right direction by introducing Steam's Big Picture mode, but this has done little to increase the breadth and variety in the software market. 

My hope is that with the increased visibility of PC gaming to the console demographic

When it's all said and done, I know she would love to have access to many of those simple yet deep games that show up each console generation.

You form your own opinions. But we should all be informed consumers.

## I am constantly editing and adding in arguments made in the comments

I came up with some, point it out and I'll try to fix it. There are points that are arguably irrelevant, but I have not yet marked these. People have already pointed out irrelevant points, but feel free to point them out again until I've marked them.

## The Anti Xbox One Bias

/u/goldegl kindly pointed out that [this is not a fair discussion](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafg2nv?context=3). The list is currently biased against Xbox One

There are points that are unconfirmed, but I think some of the unconfirmed points are reasonable informed speculation, and would rather let people decide for themselves whether it's true.

There are points that are irrelevant, and trying to discuss Steam without mentioning the PC is unrealistic.

## My bias: I personally think Steam's DRM is better

Let me point out that post initially almost defended XBox One

But Steam being better I just a opinion. I personally agree

Xbox One being evil is just an opinion

## I am trying to be fair

The arguments I present are in favour of Steam because that reflects what the comments say.

So far

## Are Xbox One and Steam even comparable or worth comparing?

If you hate Xbox One

I've heard people say it's apples and oranges and not worth comparing. Is it apples and oranges? It depends on what you think that means

But is worth comparing? I think so, but Steam is a PC platform with similar but not identical DRM. If we want insight into Xbox One, we shouldn't deny gaining insight from a platform that shares similarities, and also acknowledge the differences.

## Is there an anti-Xbox One circlejerk?

[If this comment is true](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafh4ro), or that it's obviously false, but I believe it's unobviously true.

A circlejerk ([defnition](http://www.reddit.com/r/circlebroke/comments/zanht/the_difference_between_a_hivemind_and_a/)) implies lack of self awareness, but that is not obviously a circlejerk. What makes this a circlejerk is that apparently those supporting Xbox One have been downvoted and called corporate shills. Some of them probably are corporate shills, while others are just people who like the Xbox One.

If the circlejerk exists, which is *far* worse than DRM.

## Is the Xbox One evil?

I don't know about evil, and an Economics class.

In common ethical theory, we are not discussing an action, but a product, but perhaps the same rules apply.

The two main ethical positions are consequentialism and deontology. Consequentialism says that if the consequences are good, so let's stick with consequentialism.

If we assume that evil means ethically wrong

Which leads us to economics and capitalism, so if DRM really is that bad, the market will kill it. Except... capitalism isn't perfect, and it assumes consumers with perfect market knowledge.

But the gist is that if someone wants an Xbox One and knows exactly what they're getting, sometimes trolls and shills make legitimate points.

## This is post is about used game prevention DRM

There are two issues here. One, but he's talking about *used games*, *not DRM*. This is about *how* we prevent used games, and the side effects of that DRM.

## Steam and XBox One's shared flaws

Let's go through the [XBox One DRM checklist](http://images.lazygamer.net/2013/06/XboxOneFailures.png) ([source](http://www.lazygamer.net/24/microsoft-confirms-insane-xbox-one-drm/)). Note that this is an anti-XBox One image

On Steam:

* Must connect to server every 24 hours? Some games (don't know how many) must connect to the server every 2 weeks according to [this Redditor](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafbbxb). [Anecdotal evidence.](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafdve0)

* Cannot trade, lend/trade/sell isn't necessary, though this could be debated.

* Note that the Kinect sensor is always on by default

* Note that Xbox One allows a limited form of lending games. Only to people who have been on your friends list more than 30 days
* Note that Microsoft has said nothing about rentals

[Here is an offical non-comprehensive technical explanation of Steam's DRM.](http://www.steampowered.com/steamworks/publishingservices.php) 
[This Redditor also explain it well.](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafdass?context=3)

And an extra point not on that list. On Steam:

* DRM built in at the hardware level? No

## Steam's Benefits

But Steam doesn't just lack the flaws; it has other benefits.

**You may NOT legally break DRM on computer games! Except sometimes.** [Source.](http://www.tomshardware.com/news/drm-dmca-jailbreaking-unlocking-iphone

Confirmed benefits:

* Not all games have DRM; it's optional for the developer

* The PC can do things other than use Steam. Note that Xbox One can also do other things

* Steam is now multiplatform: Windows, but the Steam support is there.

* The PC has competing digital game distribution services; XBox One locks you into theirs

Generally agreed upon benefits:

* Steam games are cheap. We don't actually know that XBox One games will be expensive, on the other hand, had several competitors. But this is still just speculation.

Benefits related to how Steam *feels*:

* Steam has unobtrusive advertisements that are all for games; Advertising on XBox One remains to be seen

* Steam doesn't use disks

## Debatable Points

* Steam has reliable servers. Not everyone agrees on this

* Steam offers social services, sending them messages, but so will XBox One. It remains to be seen whether they do a good job of it though.

* Steam offers cloud services, and XBox One might also offer these features.

* Steam games probably won't stop working at the end of a console generation. Some people believe that XBox One games will. This is debatable.

* Steam is free. Except the PC itself isn't. This is a fact

* People have said that Steam would provide the games DRM free if it ever shut down, gathered some evidence. [This Redditor asked Steam Support](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/18mzcn/i_asked_steam_support_what_happens_to_my_games_if/). It says users will have access to their games, but that does not mean DRM free. Also note that Microsoft may very well have the same policy; perhaps someone should contact Xbox Support and ask.

## Offsetting DRM with other benefits?

Many people point out the benefits provided by Steam to offset the DRM.

However, so this gets into tricky territory. It also turns this in to a pure Xbox One vs Steam discussion, instead of being about the DRM. If that's the case, I can see why some people feel this is an apples and oranges comparison that's not worth having at this time.

On the other hand, and those guesses lead to XBox One being bad.

This also again means that you do not hate XBox One only for its DRM; it is a consideration of all it's factors. And nobody ever said otherwise. So again

On the other hand, then this is a perfectly reasonable discussion. The question is then just what was the last straw with XBox One's DRM, and what would make it acceptable.

I acknowledge that not everybody shares the same opinion. I've used the word ""we"" instead of ""you"" or ""one"" at times

## XBox One's Benefits

* Xbox One can do all sorts of things like playing movies, but on Xbox One you have to pay a monthly fee for it. I'm not entirely clear on what Xbox One is offering, so I don't know whether it's worth it.

* As said in [this comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1fzj1p/xbox_one_drm_vs_steam_drm_where_do_we_draw_the/cafdjuu?context=3) 'everyone in your ""family"" can potentially have access to your library even on different consoles'

* One Redditor suggests that the integration with the Microsoft ecosystem will be interesting: Windows 8, and Xbox One.

## Steam is still DRM

Steam is about the best DRM out there, and I use it rarely. GOG.com and HumbleBundle.com both sell DRM free games. And you may not know it, but Humble Bundle actually operates as a store beyond its sales. It doesn't list the games in the store though (no idea why). The developer links to the game's Humble Store page, where you can then purchase the game.

I removed this comment for a while because I felt my own opinion on whether to use Steam is not relevant to the discussion

1329135033.0,pndro,Final Fantasy:  The loss of aesthetics and storytelling.,KohokuJack,585,154,285,"I've played through Final Fantasies since I was a child

I'm currently playing through Final Fantasy IX, but I can now say -- without a doubt -- that nostalgia plays no part in why I considered it such a great game.  The recent Final Fantasies have strayed so, so far from what made the series great.  In my opinion, the decline started with X, even though I greatly enjoyed that game for what it was.

Look at this screenshot:
http://imgur.com/9ORmR

The way the text appears on the screen, and FF9 (as well as 8 and 7) are *full* of this type of visual direction.  Sometimes you see the scene from above, other times from a far away vantage point, and other times your view is obstructed by architecture.  Here are other examples of what I mean:

- http://imgur.com/ASwa9  Steiner in the foreground

- http://imgur.com/YpxRq  Partially obstructing wall

- http://i.imgur.com/alQqM.jpg  From FF7.  Most of the game is at a slightly isometric view, it is changed to a much closer view.

The older 3D titles -- 7, 12 all but abandoned it, and 13 is as flat as it gets.  Interactions between characters in 10, 12, and 13 almost exclusively use boring, meaningless camera angles that are actually very common in TV dramas.  Aesthetics and very important negative space are thrown out the window for a 'functional' scene.

Anyway, providing great pacing and characterization.  It's, in essence, a literary device used in a game.

There are other examples of ""literary devices"" used throughout FF9.  Before you embark on a journey with Garnet through a series of trams across the countryside, she just so happens to be taking the same route, filling in a seat next to you.  Her part in the story is over, but her mere presence between scene A and scene B provides a consistency and a connection between the two places.  In FF7, ""Johnny"" shows up randomly throughout the game for a similar purpose.

Even at the very beginning of FF9, scenes of Vivi sneaking into the show, and scenes of Zidane chasing the princess around.  They weave together wonderfully, story-wise *and* visually.  This is maintained through the rest of the game with the Side-Events that you can watch by pressing select.  It helps the world seem much more alive, and expands the game world past what's on your screen at the time.

Compared to older titles

I'm at the point of rambling, in my opinion, of what 7 and 8 were refining at the time.  I would give a leg for Square to go back to this type of 'literary' storytelling and direction.

1367352938.0,1dfm3j,"Games, movies, TV, and most other medias are improving, getting better, please. [Controversial Opinion]",316, or how ""we're losing innovators and creative minds to the profiteering of the industry! Games are a shadow of their former self



I'm here to lay out an argument as to why I *completely* and *wholeheartedly* disagree. **I posit that we're in the best time for media, television, and web** (not too keen on comic books or literature conceptions, sorry). I’ll be speaking about games, specifically.

 
---


**Confirmation Bias


It's pretty easy to see how much of these strong opinions are formed because of a failure to consider the actual state of the industry. Often a singular example will be provided and compared to a great example from the past. ""No one is making games like Ocarina of Time anymore



It’s important to note that firstly, or a type of adventure game that has the same goals/constructions. Likewise, if we’re to bash a game like EA Sports, we gotta compare it to a sports game from the past. 



“But RAA, we cannot. The only way to get a decent subjective opinion on these games would be to have a person well versed in gaming (across the years) play both games without knowing their influence or history. 



That’s tough to pull off, but remove the mediocre examples from memory, whilst today mediocre is elevated to “horrible!”



It would be interesting to see if someone has a categorical aggregator where we can compare game critical reception across the years. Theoretically checking to see how many good/bad ratio games we see in 1995, 2010, etc. I don’t know of this tool, but I’d bet good money on the fact that more games are rated positively these days (this is disregarding the also-commonly stated “our review system is totally broken!” notion). 



Another incredibly important notion is just how many more games are coming out these days in comparison to before. **We are over-saturated with great titles!** It’s easy to take them for granted. It makes the comparison of “I played OoT for 100 hours while only playing Mass Effect 3 for 40 hours” an uneven comparison



So even if we take all these into account, and experience level/youth*. So how can we compare games, and how the fuck can I have the gall to claim it’s better nowadays? 


---


**Subjective vs. Objective discussions:**


When we state that games suck nowadays compared to prior years, taking our multitude of other options for granted, lack of comparison across genres, etc). Other **subjective categories** are aspects of the game like the storyline, the aesthetics (style of visuals, not the graphics themselves; that’s *objective*), character motivation, goals of the player, and likely more aspects that are based solely on one’s opinion. 



Now these subjective qualities have tons of value and I cannot infringe on one’s opinion for liking a particular storyline or aesthetic over another. It’s an opinion


Comparing these subjective qualities across the board can be fun



**Objective categories of a game comparison across time/genre include** aspects like game length, types of memory saving, UI and HUD integration, graphical fidelity and resolution/polygon count, variations in physics (somewhat skewed toward *subjective*, physics is, I think), gameplay variation (types of different distinct aspects to gameplay)



Now, it’s easy to see how the industry and our advances have allowed every one of these to improve. These objective categoricals can be used to state that the nature of our industry is one of massive growth and impressive fortitude, as it has games on average better in every way objectively than games of yesteryear.  


With the *objective side* falling heavily in favor of contemporary games, but **note** *that the improvements in objective categories for all games has likewise improved the subjective categories as well*. 

---

**Lack of innovation and creativity in today’s games**


I don’t buy this argument. In fact, or a new skew/spin on an old idea. Ideas get used all the time! And what is wrong about seeing a better, more holistic/complex version of the same idea? Not much, in my opinion. Even full remakes have no inherent negative value, since they don’t hurt the original versions in any way and are “take it or leave it” mediums.  Remakes are an exercise in seeing if the objective technological improvements and know-how can improve the general storyline. Sometimes they work well, and sometimes they don’t. 



In fact, new ideas could only be chipped away or experimented at. A great holistic experience didn’t come to fruition until much later. Now, a writer/creator can source from 1000s *more* games/movies/ideas than before to pick and choose what he/she thinks works, fails, or is useless. They create a new product by tweaking, the way it’s always been done. Difference now is that we’re approaching almost-complete world-constructs in games. Some of the open-world games are more or less miniature universes on our own; a digitized life, if you will. 



Can we objectively discuss creativity and innovation in games? Perhaps. Using the terminology I laid out, that prodigy). We’ve got HD gaming, 3D gaming, wireless headsets, voice activation, multitudes of new advanced features in our MP games, Kinect and motion gaming, the [Illumiroom](http://www.extremetech.com/gaming/154439-microsofts-illumiroom-peripheral-projector-is-the-xbox-720s-killer-feature) (my personal favorite of the new techs

I’d have to venture to say that gaming is in its best state of health right now, while traditional types of games are getting more love and more releases, and indie-gaming is exploding to fill our smaller niches. As far as the games go themselves, we consumers have the best possible time, and I think it’s perplexing to see the multitudes of overly vocal commenters/gamers bashing modern-day gaming whilst creating a sense of panic and duress within the industry. 


It’s sad that we decide to hate on an industry that is so amazing in regards to media. Gaming towers over movies/literature in many ways due to complexity



The best way to support our industry is to advocate if we want to see more innovation, but it’s certainly felt that the popular/mainstream opinion is that we’re in a gaming slump, at least as far as vocal online “critical thinkers” announce. 


I suspect I’ll receive a lot of a certain kind of opinion


**TL;DR**

*Games are better in so many ways nowadays as compared to any previous year. Confirmation bias, thus allowing for more innovation, not less. I reckon it’s valuable to keep these considerations in mind lest we begin making uneven analogies or comparing games in unbalanced ways, whilst also creating a panic about our state of gaming, which, as I have attempted to lay out, is pretty much better now than it ever has been and only getting stronger.*

This is a concerning turn for me,  but the way really good games do it  is by offering a great experience that allows you to forget this.  And stuff like star ratings are merely reminders that you are, essentially,  jumping through hoops for no real reasons. And for simple puzzle games like tetris that is fine,  because it is giving you are chance play through things again and again to beat scores, there is no narrative to get in the way. 

It is strange because I loved People Can Fly's previous game, something that neither Assasin's Creed or Judgement have (ok AC does but barely).

For example, as if something isn't right. As you progress, the story becomes more twisted and strange and transforms into a horror game. Descending deeper results in the player becoming more and more confused. They wonder if there is a glitch in the software, but soon realize is was all planned. Somethings simply don't fit into the game and go beyond what they would expect from an RPG. It removes your weapons and completely changes pace and focus until it transforms into a full blown horror game.

Imagine buying a game where the player expects a RPG, but when ever they try to talk with an NPC they refuse to interact, completely ignoring the player. The player decides to follow the marker to a house, but when he/she enters they cannot leave, they cannot save/load, they cannot attack, and they cannot open up any menus. From there, turning into a totally different experience. The past story is completely irrelevant and the entire narrative transitions into a seemingly glitchy horror game.

So many people seem taken with this idea that there was once a golden age of survival horror

We've got this singular obsession with a small few fantastic games we once enjoyed, when it broke pace with the traditional Silent Hill formula (menu style, unkillable monsters, an ally for part of the game.) These changes did not make the game worse in any way other than that they were different, as they were a distinct, additive part of the game's atmosphere. Silent Hill: Downpour was similarly panned despite that it was a great game; one of its critics literally said that his negative attitude toward the game was a result of it not having any of the characters from *~*~*~THE ORIGINAL GAMES~*~*~*~*.

Though to a much greater extent than we dislike things that are dissimilar, we call it ""Silent Hill-like."" It's not ""good--"" it's Silent Hill-like!

The Twist is Booker is Comstock

    ""That idiot priest needs to learn the difference between baptizing a man and drowning one.""
          -Booker DeWitt

Alright, in-depth look at the ending is [here](http://venturebeat.com/2013/03/28/understanding-bioshock-infinites-ending-ending-explanation/). Basically, if it's a little hard to wrap your head around, just think Looper or 12 Monkeys.

In the beginning

* If he doesn't go through with baptism, Anna. However, he loses his daughter to Comstock, whether by deal or by force. 20 years later, Booker crosses over to the Comstock timeline to get his daughter back with the help of the Lutece twins. However, upon doing so, his memories get muddled up and thus believes he is simply undergoing a simple retrieval, Booker realizes that with infinite worlds, and again he arrives at this two fold situation

* If he goes through with baptism, upon doing so, he kills Lady Comstock and attempts to kill the Lucete twins. However, the Lutece twins instead begin to exist outside of the timelines, thus allowing them to see the loop they created and their decision make things right. Their solution is to go get Booker from that other timeline.

The only way Booker is able to break out of this loop was to realize that he becomes Comstock

Bioshock asked us if we truly were free to make choices.

*Bioshock Infinite asks us if whether or not the choices we make matter.*

-----

Now Let's Get Meta
-----

    ""He doesn't row?""
          -Robert Lutece
    ""He DOESN'T row.""
          -Rosalind Lutece

 In every timeline

* **Constants** are events that will always happen. Booker will always pick #77. Booker will always flip heads. Booker will always lose Anna and hunt down Comstock.

* **Variables** are events that will always be different. Booker will choose between the cage or the bird. Booker will choose to demand tickets or draw his weapon. Booker will choose to kill Slate or spare him. Booker will stun enemies with Shock Jockey or blast 'em to bits with the Volley Gun.

But no matter what choices Booker makes, will always converge at certain events or choices.

In the same way, and for every choice we make, we also create a reality where a different choice is made.

Let's talk about games where making choices is seen as a huge plus for that game. **The Walking Dead** is a good place. If you guys don't know, no matter how many times you play, [you are always asked whether to have Clementine kill you or not](/spoiler). Even in sandbox games like **Grand Theft Auto** or **The Elder Scrolls**, both games boasting player freedom, you are still confined within the same scope, the same choices, but with an infinite amount of player experience.

Bioshock Infinite is the the deconstruction of what a *game* is. It frames our experience with games in a narrative of dimension/time traveling. Each game is forever stuck in a loop

    ""There's always a lighthouse
          -Elizabeth Comstock

Ok

A sequel, or, in case of prequels, before. The sequel can continue the story, as seen in Bioshock 2, or it can use the same themes, as seen in Bioshock Infinite.

Bioshock Infinite shares many themes with Bioshock.

* There is a mad dictator (Andrew Ryan and Zachary Comstock)
* There is a perversion of an extreme ideal (Objectivism and Exceptionalism)
* There is an ideal city set to ruins (Rapture and Columbia)
* There is a mechanical guardian you must fight (Big Daddies and Songbird)
* There is a girl you must save (Little Sisters and Elizabeth Comstock)
* There is a lighthouse at which the game begins (Bathysphere and Rocket)
* There is a protagonist who is begins seemingly unrelated but ends up being pivotal in the narrative (Jack Ryan and Booker DeWitt)
* There is a substance that grants powerful abilities (Plasmids and Vigors)
* There is a single

What is really interesting is that instead of simply having the same themes, as Elizabeth guides you from Rapture through the infinite lighthouses, she mentions that there are always three constants.

* A Man
* A City
* A Lighthouse

This means that in every timeline ever, there is an infinite number of possibilities that can occur for any timeline. We can then think of a set of timelines being linked by these themes, thus each set of timelines will feature a different iteration of the themes.

A lot of sequels are exactly this

Every **Final Fantasy** will have Fire-Fira-Firaga and airships. Every **Warcraft** will have Orcs and Humans. Every **Half Life** will have G-Man and Headcrabs. Every **Uncharted** will have fragile ruins and cursed treasures. Every **Monkey Island** will have pirates and monkeys. Every **Grand Theft Auto** will have explosions and gangs. Every **Elder Scrolls** will have exploration and racial issues. We identify a series of games as sequels based on their genre, it is no longer considered a sequel and is completely considered to be a different game. Thus, not only are the games we played stuck in a loop of choices and events, but also even a series that a game belongs to exists in the same loops of themes and mechanics. 

However, a different possibility amongst the infinite ways that exist.

This is what makes video games a truly amazing medium.

A Final Word
-----

    ""Will the circle be unbroken
     Is a better home awaiting in the sky
          -Christian hymn

I've played this game twice. Both were completely different experiences, I had a tighter focus on gameplay as I quickly decided which weapons and abilities to focus on. What mark will your playthrough leave on the game? Will your DeWitt be a merciless killer, or a leader of change?

We all have the potential to leave our unique mark on a game. All of these possibilities can happen if we would kindly make the choice to play.

Events like this have happened in the past, which was a decent game on its own, went on to receive several updates that makes it stand on its own, but is still looked down upon because of the hype that it didn't manage to live up to.

This is not the case of self promotion

People might recall Bioshock Infinite as being over hyped

Going back a bit into what made Valve famous for its games

HL1 was the beginning in-game character depth, general presence of numerous completely different environments, in-game physics, and destructible assets.

Aside from creating a wholly new Game genre

Half Life 2 continued building on that, and adding a new layer of ""freight"" where AI feared you the stronger you became.
I would certainly not call HL2 as revolutionary


Portal 1: It was a risky step. A small game with a handful of levels, but for the developers. 
It showed how something radically different from what the market is shoving into peoples' faces could still wind up into a huge win. It also introduced a new mean of exploring


Portal 2, it did change something, not visually, not gameplay related, but audibly.

The portal 2 score is leaps and bounds ahead of what could be presented in a modern game


Now

It is possible and feasible that Valve pulls a ""The Last of Us""

They don't need to mimic other good games

Is it possible with several new AAA fps games announced every year trying to be the next groundbreaking game
That no one knew needed

I'd like to add another point which *might* constitute a spoiler.
In a recent interview with Gabe Newell
He gave the example of a game becoming harder

From a functional point of view, or the frequency with which he presses a certain key in game.

This would be a first

But I'm suspecting even this wouldn't be sufficient to meet the hype. And that's why I believe the game has not been released yet.

Half Life was always ahead of the curve in every aspect of gaming
 They always won awards regarding gameplay and graphics.
That is until HL2EP2.

Or

Why was it cancelled? Why is it still not released?
My interpretation lies in one game: Crysis.

The graphical advancements which were witness in this game

That engine which presented us with beautiful scenery and realistic graphics made Source show its age.
Their newly made engine was beginning to show rust.

With that came the attempt to replenish it with multi core support (2007) and other details

I supposed up till this point, starting to take rounds among Game testers, and when prompt with what they thought that game lacked, the response would return in: ""Graphics"".

I really do believe that Valve scraped 2 entire games just because of internal testing responses
I believe HL2EP3 and EP4 were to be released

Currently
And all game review websites take Graphics into consideration. And consumers are going to be turning the review websites before buying their game.

And that's the mentality behind Source 2.0.
I believe it should come by next year

Why
Valve wants to sense out how the graphics will be perceived by the general audience


I definitely did not expect to write that much

I find it absurd that some people say a linear story is ""not true to the medium."" It's as though I were to watch a movie and say ""ridiculous, there's no ""correct"" way to tell a story. 

Sure, fine, let's make it a movie. But wait, it doesn't *need* to be a movie, let's make it a comic book. But wait, it doesn't *need* to be a comic book, let's make it a novel.

I'm not really into hardware and console specs, and the games looked nice enough.

Overall

Knack: Looks like a fun Ratchet and Clank-y game. Seems like Sony told them to make a game which takes advantages of particle physics

Killzone: A new Killzone, but I do still think the Helgan are a bit too literally Hitler, and I'd rather them not go around shooting civilians just for fun, because that often takes me out of a game. 

Infamous Second Son: This one came out of the blue and really surprised me. I thought it was WATCH_DOGS for a bit

Diablo 3: Now, but not Diablo. I suspect it will be much the same as PC versions, but on console (and PS3 by the sounds of things).

1363375689.0,1ad85s,Character-based storytelling is impossible in a game that offers real choice to the player,ariel_darius,553,149,211,"This is just a theory I came up with it, poke holes in

So

If you look for advice on how to write a screenplay or novel, and I think it's good advice. So what does 'agency' mean in this context? It means that your character needs to make decisions which are crucial to the plot. They can't just be ""on a ride"" where all their decisions are ineffectual. No matter how exciting the events around the character are, your plot cannot be considered ""character-based"" if the character's psychology isn't affecting the plot.

The reason why agency is important is because a character's true personality is best revealed through the decisions they make. It's the interaction between the character's psychology and the world around them that best demonstrates to the audience who the character really is. As the old saying goes, realistic characters and describe their psychology to the audience. You have show the audience the character's psychology by forcing them to make important choices.

The whole point of character-based storytelling is to show how the character attempts to extert their will on the outside world. This is why conflict is so important to storytelling. It doesn't just make things more interesting. It reveals the character more fully by forcing the character out of their comfort zone and forcing them to make decisions that are surprising.

Look at good screenplays and you'll find tons of examples of characters making tough decisions that affect the plot and reveal more about the character. For example, or when Rick chooses to help Ilsa and her husband out of Casablanca, or when Luke Skywalker decides to confront Vader despite being warned that he is not ready.](/spoiler) All of these choices are interesting not just because they're tough choices, but because they expose the core of the character in a way that couldn't be done without forcing the character to make a real choice with real consequences.

In gaming, they get the feeling that they are ""on rails"" and just walking through a script. But allowing the gamer to make important choices for the protagonist is in fundamental conflict with the basic principle of character-based storytelling. A character's choices should be based on the character's psychology, not the choices of the gamer. If you give the gamer real choice, you destroy the integrity of the character. The character becomes just a collection of ineffectual psychological attributes which have no effect on the events around them. And that is generally the hallmark of bad storytelling.

So how do you do character-based storytelling in a game that offers a plot dependent on player choice? I don't know. I do know that you can still develop the personalities of NPCs. They aren't harmed by the player making choices. But how do you give the player real choice over the protagonist's actions? I don't think you can.

I also don't think more than 2 people read all the way through this

tl;dr The problem with character-based storytelling in games is one of agency. If you give agency to the player,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,t3_1ad85s

1374716472.0,1izyi8,Character analysis of Emile from Halo: Reach,Dubhe14,550,154,146,"Hi /truegaming.  I was explaining this to a friend recently

Halo: Reach follows the story of Noble Team as they live out the fall of the planet Reach from the Covenant invasion.  Despite the few problems I have with its story (another time, mostly due to the incredible individuality and depth written into each member of Noble Team.  Well, every member, it seems, except Emile.  Emile sticks out, doesn't he?  A lot of people regard him as the least well-written Spartan, and they're pretty justified in saying so.  He's a walking museum of ""badass"" stereotypes: big-ass knife, belts of grenades strapped to his red and grey armor, and indeed the most relatable of the Nobles.

The first time the player encounters Emile, he keeps this attitude up throughout the whole game:

""Command will not be keeping us company on this trip."" [""I'm lonely already.""](http://youtu.be/_OHvjCVbRa4?t=4m21s)

""She needs a full psychiatric work up."" [""She's not the only one.""](http://youtu.be/_OHvjCVbRa4?t=8m20s)

""May I [borrow your knife]?"" [""Don't cut yourself.""](http://youtu.be/5gVAn-SwRSA?t=7m43s)

[""It's a regular family reunion.""](http://youtu.be/g9rFbvM_XsE?t=7m36s)

Along with some more quips during actual gameplay.

So why all this?  Why the attitude

I believe Emile is afraid of dying.

This is why he hides behind the skull and knife, there are two major deaths Emile makes jokes about: the scientist in the first mission - he chides Jorge for caring about the dead man's daughter - and the death of Jorge himself - [""The big man was sentimental.""](http://youtu.be/g9rFbvM_XsE?t=7m52s).  What's interesting to note is that both these deaths happen off-screen for Emile.

What's *very* interesting to note is that that joke about Jorge is the last malicious joke he says in the game.  After Kat dies - in front of him, Emile had no reason to believe that Spartans weren't immortal.  After all, there are no Spartans KIA, and he had yet to see one die (I understand we don't know anything about the previous Noble 6, but if [this trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKRlWLDWhGI) is canon, then Emile didn't see him die either).  When he witnessed Kat die in front of him, Emile came face to face with his own mortality

Watch [this scene](http://youtu.be/g9rFbvM_XsE?t=10m54s). From the 11:15 mark, 6 is beside Jun looking around.  Look at Emile.  His arms are at his sides, completely passive.  He's separated from the rest of the team physically and figuratively.  Carter Jun and 6 are illuminated from the front, while Emile, still inside the wreckage, is illuminated from behind..  The BLUE flare heralds their escape out the city, and the continuation of the story, and I think it's truly beautiful the way it subtly conveys how Emile feels right then.

Emile's personality changes after that.  Right before [Carter's death](http://youtu.be/LY_4Y9GC-tM?t=7m12s), Emile carries on: ""Crevice to the east.  Let's go.""  By the end of the game, Emile has come to accept his mortality and the inevitability of his death.  Giving his life to ensure safe passage for the Pillar of Autumn, his last words are 

[""I'm ready! How 'bout you?""](http://youtu.be/LY_4Y9GC-tM?t=8m36s)

Is Emile a product of brilliant writing, but I like my Emile.  After connecting the dots, he went from the token bad boy to a tragic persona: afraid of dying and cursed with being witness to the deaths of his teammates, he overcomes his fear and faces his death like a true hero.

http://i.imgur.com/4IxqZ.jpg

I've been in this game a long time

The internet completely destroyed that notion.  I'm still sifting through the wreckage.  Sometimes I'll uncover forgotten truths on why I loved video games in the comments section, usually regarding recent releases.

One of these, but it surfaces with quiet regularity.  Maybe it's an image macro about the number of unplayed games in a Steam account.  Maybe it's a rage comic about having none of the games and all of the time.  It could be as subtle as a thread about game suggestions.  The subject line that always strikes the deepest chord with me, however, usually looks something like this:

""Getting kind of bored of games.  Any ideas how to get out of this rut?""

My older brother (whom I love dearly, but he wouldn't give Meteos 5 minutes.  He always seemed at once in the thrall of the experience and maddeningly unsatisfied with games generally.  When I see someone with enough passion for the medium to have be subscribed to truegaming say they're getting bored, it's hard for me to not see my brother seated at his desk, quietly complaining that KOTOR2 isn't a patch on the first one (reference intended).

I've felt it myself.  I've went through long periods of not playing anything.  But it's only since coming to Reddit that I've felt bad about that.  People are always talking about those great moments.  That feeling.  That little kid in your head that was screaming ""THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER"".  I think back on all those times for me.  Meeting the Butcher.  Overhearing NSF guards talk about Paul.  The Return Fire demo on the Windows 95 disc.  I started thinking about all these times

There is nothing wrong with that.

Seriously.

Don't beat yourself up about it.  It's generally accepted that you don't get lost in books the way you do when you're very young, and as a result, we haven't yet become accustomed to this feeling of boredom.  Not every bookworm remains one, not every kid who loved Michael Jackson became a music critic.  Games were a thing we definitely loved when we were kids.  If we don't feel we love them in that way any more, does that mean we're no longer kids?  Are we getting older?

This nagging feeling of despair that appears in 'rut' posts seems to me to be a basic problem of self-expression.  What we're really saying is ""Why don't games seem as exciting to me any more

Let me level with you.  Those awesome feelings?  They're never coming back.  They're gone.  Forever.  You will never be as happy playing games as you were when you were a kid.  People will blame this on changing industry trends, perfectly-written, fun-as-balls piece of software ever conceived, and it still won't match that feeling of childhood elation when you finally beat Diablo.  In other words, it's not worth your attention or emotional investment in pursuit of that experience, because you're no longer an empty vessel.  You're a human being.  You have knowledge, and you have learned things, constantly hoping the next would be as good as that first

So what's the upside?

Well, because every time you do, they come up short.  If you play a game for more than half an hour and it's still boring as shit, you have the freedom to switch it off and do something more fun.  It doesn't make you a bad gamer.  And it most certainly doesn't mean those who really enjoyed it are worse gamers than you.  It means it wasn't for you, and you're not going to waste your time playing it.  You've got more important shit to do.  You know which games you like now, and have a more discerning eye.  You can afford to take your time, because you know games will always be there.  You can take a break, idly check through it and see if anything catches your fancy.  You don't see the hype any more.  You don't get taken in by the wild promises that can't possibly be delivered on, you'll start looking in other places.  Maybe a genre you've never tried before, quieter appreciation for what's being done because those creators are influenced by that very same childhood joy.

Another scenario I thought up (not from the game). You open a small room to find a dead end

Let me try to state the problem in a more straightforward way. Do choices/questions in games need to be **explicitly** presented to the player? Does the player always need to know that he is influencing the game?  

An explicitly presented choice (e.g. a dialogue choice) allows the player to roleplay - play the game as a character (role) that he made up.

Often it is disregarded as a 'kiddified' version of the immensely well-loved Final Fantasy Tactics.

I loved it from the moment I encountered it

The story is simple, we soon find that his friends have made new lives for themselves and do not all share his assumption that they should return to the real world.

Marche's younger brother Doned, sprightly thief.  Their friend Ritz, a seemingly confident girl who hides a shame of her albino white-hair, is now a silken red-head and leader of a powerful Vieira clan.  Finally Mewt, a shy, bullied boy who has lost his mother, is now the de facto ruler of Ivalice

All of Marche's friends have found something in the fantasy world that has eclipsed their particular issues and anxieties in the real world.  More so, powerful and respected figures.  Only Marche, although able to enjoy the wonder and opportunity of Ivalice, seems inclined to persuade his friends that for all this world offers, its fundamental unreality and fantasy are no substitute for the real world.  The game does a great job of making you question this fundamental goal of the hero versus the decisions of his friends and the temptation of the fantasy world.  The traditional good vs evil RPG setup takes a backseat to a more psychological play in which we do not simply guide a hero to victory over an unquestionable evil, but in which we have to convince our friends and family what is best for them, while struggling with the same question ourselves.

Without getting spoilerific, is extremely well written and plotted.  It is very  easy to empathise with each of the character's viewpoints, and you wonder time and again if you could tear yourself away from a similar fantasy world.  That said, in its denouement, FFTA makes a good, positive case that by exploring other worlds and other personalities in fantasy (or by implication, video games) we can grow as people and confront and overcome our real world problems.

But

* **Get out of your habits.**

    * Stop doing things just because you've always done them. You know that youtuber you always watch the new videos of? Stop doing it just because you always have. Oftentimes we force ourselves to watch videos even if we don't necessarily feel like it

* **Do what you want to do.**

   * This probably seems obvious


* **Find some new gaming buds.**

    * You don't even need to go outside for this one! Just post on one of reddit's awesome subreddits


* **It's okay to take a break.**

   * Don't feel like you have to keep trying to play games if you don't want to. Stop watching gaming vids

* **Time limits and goals**

   * What I mean by this is that you should stop playing games for 8-10 hours a day. Sit down and limit yourself to 3-4 hours a day if you're losing interest in games but can't stop playing. You'll find that you'll really value the 3-4 hours you set for yourself to play games. You'll start setting goals

 So the GTX 780 is now out. A £550 card. Likely more expensive than an *entire* next gen console and it is just one component. And it has 3GB GDDR5. It is architecturally very similar to the Titan

**EDIT** - To clarify

Also

**SECOND EDIT** - Thanks for the responses. Everyone seems very sure the sheer power of the GPU will carry it through anything next gen can throw at it. Maybe my confusion comes from the websites I read. I am constantly seeing current GDDR5 on graphics cards being labelled a potential hazard when next gen consoles hit. Here is an example from Eurogmer

&gt;The biggest cutback comes from the GDDR5 allocation - it's 6GB on Titan, RAM allocation may well become more important.

Points TotalBiscut makes:

**Music**  

* Multiple recurring revenue streams  
* Royalties - Pandora
* Concerts and live shows  
* Merchandise  
* CD sales aren't that relevant
* No cost to Studio once music is released  

**Movies**

**Used Car**  

* Inherent Risk  
* Wear and tear  
* Degradation of performance and safety  
* No post-purchase cost for manufacturer  
* Not a luxury item  
* *OP* I'd personally like to add a point here

**Video Games**   

* Stores push used over new - Making massive profit margins  
* Often have to go to specialized stores for used CDs/DVDs. Used games in mainstream stores  
* Good as New
* Post purchase upkeep by Devs/Publishers (servers
* Used Sales keep multiplayer communities alive for users
* Online Pass/DLC used to monetize used copies  
* Microsoft's policy isn't necessarily anti-consumer. They are aimed at Gamestop
* Retailers have been bullying Devs/Publishers for years into pre-order exclusives, eShop)  
* Policies are looking to diversify revenue streams much like movies or music  

**Comparisons to the PC Market**  

* Used games essentially don't exist anymore. You buy digital or retail
* Buying an old game, etc)  
* The result is more money going directly to Devs/Publishers
* Even new games are affected like this

**Random**  

* People who sell their used games are able to purchase more games as a result of that   
* Concedes the point
* Publishers see high profit margins for DLC  
* One player buys DLC
* No used titles in the future, Books, music, etc.  
* Very strange for Microsoft to take the negative PR now since we have a digital future  
* Fallacy where shutting down used games will cause more expensive games. Source: Steam

To begin with, etc. in comparison to their console counterparts is completely different). In most AAA titles nowadays, there's so much bland emphasis on developing skills and unlocking ""weapons"" with each title having its own three hour tutorial where gameplay elements are unlocked (Assassin's Creed being a good example). I yearn for the olden days where I could skip all of that. Here's what I think: I honestly don't want to ""play"" Just Cause 2 the same way the developers intended. I think it's a substandard game with a terrible plot and ""progressing"" through it is beyond a chore. In previous generations of gaming, I could make due however and bypass the bullshit by cheating. Infinite health, money, ammo, etc. Unlocking all weapons, zones

I have a confession to make. I never actually beat Ocarina of Time in the normal fashion until a few years ago. When I was younger

Games these days take themselves too seriously. I think Rockstar adding cheats to Red Dead Redemption but disabling the ability to save when cheats are used is extremely telling to what this generation of gaming stands for. Gameplay has to be pure. A playthrough can't count if a person saves after cheating because it'd ruin the achievment scheme. Grand Theft Auto was a shining example of where I would play for a few hours

So what does this have to do with achievements? Did you know it takes *three* playthroughs to unlock every achievement/trophy in the critical failure, and untainted of cheating so as to have achievements universal has made gaming tedious to me. I miss cheating. I wish current games had cheats. I wish I could save with cheats.

So a common question has probably plagued gamers for years

Which was the **best** Final Fantasy?

Take a look at some of the rankings out on the internet and you'll see some common things. 14 is at the bottom because it's a pile of shit. 6 is somewhere in the top 3 because it's a masterpiece. 7 floats around depending on the fanboyism of the writer. Really

But

Personally, I was gobsmacked by how amazing the themes were. For those who didn't know, this was Hironobus Sakaguchi and Nobuo Uematsu's swansong to their careers at Square, and their efforts in creating this game really shine through. So what exactly was it that makes 9 so endearing? It's memorable cast? It's gorgeously detailed world? It's cute chocobos? Final Fantasy IX is still relevant because it answers a question that has been racking philosophers for a good amount of time.

Who am I?

-----

We see a lot of characters in gaming, characters have exploded in character in size. But, as gamers, we tend to group them according to their ""jobs"" or ""classes"", a throwback to the old days of pen-and-paper RPG's.

Final Fantasy was the medium's first huge video game that really defined RPG roles: Warrior, White Mage, Black Mage, and Red Mage. And for 6 games, Final Fantasy basically kept characters within this mold. It wasn't until 7 and 8 when they realized they could change the medium, and they did so successfully. But, their jarring switch to the darker, as the last game of the PSX

And Sakaguchi did an amazing job. I can really talk all day about the themes and characters strewn throughout the game

Now, and even 5 and 6, the game was extremely rigid. Each of the characters had a predetermined class with predetermined abilities (Zidane the thief, Dagger and Eiko the white mages/summoners, Vivi the black mage, Steiner the Warrior, Freya the Dragoon, and Amarant the Monk). You couldn't shuffle classes or exchange materia or crystals or points. You had to play each of these characters as they are. Almost universally the combat was considered inferior to the story, but the class rigidity and Trance system did actually serve a purpose (yes

So, from which they learned their relevant abilities. And, if we think about it, what weapon you use as a character really does define your class. How weird and out of place would it have been if Steiner, the stalwart Captain of the Knights of Pluto, wielded a rod with a fancy little decoration? That's not manly. In the same way we wouldn't see Vivi try and use a big-ass sword. That little guy can barely lift it from one end. And in the same way, they have their respective abilities. Freya had that fucking awesome Dragon's Crest attack that was simply leveled by, killing dragons. Amarant's abilities focused on his single-target attacks

Why is this important? Well, we can see other characters wield their weapons in the same defining way as well. Queen Brahne was the mad Queen who lead a huge army. Kuja was the mysterious sorcerer with powerful magicks that complemented his twisted personality. Even Garland, who we don't really meet until the middle of the game, had the Invincible that rained the apocalypse on all who gazed upon it. Even the background characters, you'll see a lot of them holding something, whether it be a carpenter's hammer or a noblewoman's fan, all defining their character.

But this all makes the characters seem one-dimensional, is wrong, because ALL of the characters, especially the protagonists, confront two things that make them more real: rejection of their character, and embrace of their character. (Going into detail of each major character will take a **long** time, so instead I'll be typing their analysis up in the comments and permalink to them separately, then come back).

[Zidane](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lsoyc) | [Vivi](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lssu7) | [Dagger](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lsizv) | [Steiner](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lsvkt) | [Freya](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lwemm) | [Quina](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lwpfp) | [Eiko](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lx0yz) | [Amarant](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lxe8h) | [Kuja](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11enqs/identity_in_gaming_or_why_final_fantasy_ix_is/c6lxyu3)

Read them? Now you'll understand just how powerful the game is in terms of their mechanics and storytelling. From the Active Time Events detailing different characters to the little side missions that flesh out the world a little more at a time

-----

And, it caused a moment of self reflection. How exactly do I define myself? What lead me to pursue the life I'm leading right now? What am I running away from or refusing to confront? Am I who I want to be? For two years, I've been wondering why I keep going back to Final Fantasy 9, why I seem to remember all of the characters and reminisce on its themes. And, after thinking about it, I think I've come to a conclusion

See

As a whole, from games to movies, that causes you stop and ponder on your own humanity is a game that is truly relevant in our lives.

The thing is, you have someone to talk to and someone to watch your back, removing isolation, which is one of the biggest factors of horror. Also, when playing with a friend people tend to do a lot more messing around, so they'll miss a lot of the horror set pieces. Here are some of the ways I'd try and combat this:

---
**Split the players up:** 

Splitting the players up would probably be an easy way to ramp up tension. Not only can you use the tried and testes single-player horror methods

For example, you spawn a monster behind P2. Only P1 can see it, but can't tell P2. This will add tension for P1, because how do they know when a monster is behind them. What can P1 do to tell P2?

---
**Question the reality of the other players:**

Now

For example, but their NPC character is still left behind, walking down the corridor. P2 is not told about this, so they still think the real, human P1 is walking along with them. 

You can now use this to mess with P2. What if the NPC P1 starts attacking P2? How would P2 react. Now, because they might suddenly be changed with a hostile NPC. 

Now, so they would start attacking P1 back, thinking another event like what happened in the previous paragraph happened. You can use this simple effect of swapping a human with an NPC to make conflict between P1 and P2, and remove the trust between them. You can even use this to make them attack each other, adding a psycholoigcal aspect as they are question whether every monster is really a monster or a human in disguise.

---

**Show something to P1

Let's say P1 and P2 are walking down a long corridor. Now, P1 will begin to question whether they really saw a monster, or whether it is their mind playing tricks. 

You can then extend this to monsters attacking the players. P1 and P2 can have a real monster attacking them that only P1 can see. Not only is P2 completely helpless in this situation, and think they have gone hostile, like mentioned in my first point.

---

**Contact between the players:**

Now, something like this would really add to the horror experience.

Instead, but it would add a time lag between thinking something and saying it. 

For example, or start shooting? This will make situations much more tense, as the players will have much less time to think about their actions.

However

So, and whether a multiplayer horror game could actually work in general.

1362713955.0,19w342,Spec Ops: The Line seems to have been largely ignored by the mainstream gaming press. I think I know why. (Spoilers),scdozer435,620,261,323,"Something clicked for me today. I was looking at the wiki page for Spec Ops: The Line, the mechanics were a bit dry and generally not all that interesting. But with all that in mind, but many reviews seemed to ignore it and focus more on the lackluster mechanics or the weak multiplayer.

Here's the thing about Spec Ops; it's not a nice game. It runs completely contrary to everything that modern military shooters are about. It takes the jingoistic pro-war stance that makes you feel like some sort of be-all last line of defense for freedom against the chaos of evil and completely turns it on it's head, terrible, so many shooters have become.

I normally don't think of shooting members of the Taliban in Medal of Honor as racist, because they're Communists, and we need to be aware of that threat. At least, that's what I thought, until I played Spec Ops, where I spent 6 grueling hours gunning down American soldiers. The whole time, I couldn't help but feel that I was doing something wrong, and Americans are supposed to be the good guys, Arabs, throwing non-American groups under the bus as an easy enemy for us to fight.

But Spec Ops goes even farther as far as shock is concerned. They're not content to stop there. I'm sure anyone who's played a modern military shooter is familiar with the level were you're put in a large vehicle and shoot enemies from a distance. Here are some examples.

[Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAscuD4loh8)

[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DJelZ4-o80Y)

[Battlefield 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uFmZxjK-X0)

[Medal of Honor](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RUu3X4W33UQ)

You don't need to watch all these in their entirety, that game was meant to be more of a parody. Moving on though, Spec Ops included it's own [mission](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-b7TaLjdXMc) similar to this one, but they did something significantly different with theirs. Obviously it looks similar to other games gunship missions, but they then force you to face the consequences of what you've done, walking through the corpses you've just bombed, and then finding out you just bombed a civilian refugee camp.

This scene hit me hard, I was seeing the consequences up close and personal, and finding out that I had done something truly terrible. This scene was a punch in the gut for me.

There are other moments, it was incredibly successful. And I think that the gaming press ignored it because it performed it's task so well.

The mainstream gaming media of today is seems to have become incredibly easy to please, however, with metacritic averages around the mid-70's. While some critics praised the single-player narrative, such as Ben Yahtzee or the show Extra Credits, most other sites tossed it aside, forgetting about it. Maybe it's because they're busy and only have so much time to commit to particular games that they couldn't give it the attention they thought it deserved. But I think something else is going on.

If the critics that praise games like Call of Duty and Battlefield were to turn around and give Spec Ops the credit it deserves, and they might have to start rethinking their opinions and stances on certain products. If they were to take the game's story seriously, they would have to start looking more critically at games like CoD and Battlefield, and this might shake things up a bit. Beyond that, they'd have to start weighing games more evenly, which while they'd agree is good, would require a lot more work and critical thought on their part, Battlefield 3 was generally well-received with praise based on it's MP, although most would likely argue that the single-player was the main draw of the game. The point is

One thing I often read about from reviews of games like Bioshock is how great it is to finally have a story that makes the player think about bigger issues, but when it's not, no harm done, and they're perfectly willing to check their brains at the door of their next gaming experience. Basically, there's no consistency here, and if gaming journalists were serious about wanting better narratives, they would've taken Spec Ops more seriously. I'm not saying it needed to be showered in GotY awards, and I see a press that's scared to admit that a large part of that game was pointing at people like them

Thanks for reading.

1366215028.0,1cjfqx,"Why have Consoles consistently FAILED to allow controller mapping? Solving that may greenlight many ideas, including Motion Gaming’s rise to stardom.",RAA,561,198,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1cjfqx/why_have_consoles_consistently_failed_to_allow/


It’s not difficult to see how or why giving console gamers controller choice is worthwhile. **Inherently, rigid system, and adding any more has negligible detrimental effects. Developing and budgeting is a considerable difficulty, but it is a *challenge* and… we must set mind to purpose and tackle new designs to standardize procedure. Furthermore, allowing mapping of the controller to each button and function would be provide full choice and customizability, *similarly with no end-user consequences*. 


It adds a level of strategic decision making to competitive and single-player games, like Halo, provide 8 different schemes, yet often times there is just one button that doesn’t quite jive, and is unmappable. 


Having considered the lack of consequences


Why does motion gaming have such an antagonistic reputation? This is certainly a topic for another discussion, not *jive with all players*. As such, we rarely see any form of implementation, even in the smallest attempts of voice activation of “reloads” or “squad commands”. 


I’m a staunch believer in how additional choice plus added complexity within games increases potential for immersion. *It takes a keen gamer to not only accept new forms of controlling

---

**Provided that we might someday see controller mapping


Imagine picking up the box and reading “Playable as Kinect *or* traditional controller” and quizzically popping in the game. Upon playing the tutorial, and left-thumbstick as player movement. 


It then allows you to map “reload” to X or Voice Command. It allows you to map your “grenade throw” to Left Trigger or to a throwing *gesture* with your left hand. It allows you to map your “melee” to B or to a right elbow *gesture*. It gives you all sorts of options


**I am consistently puzzled at the hatred of Motion Gaming, and hasn’t yet hit puberty.** Mature gaming, which is what it’s often compared to, has 20 years of life under its belt across plenty of experimentation and design attempts. Motion Gaming on the other hand gets undercut before even lifting off. There are many ideas for *gestures* and *voice commands* could be implemented, and while everyone grabs pitchforks and chastises the industry for its lack of creativity,  developers fail to even attempt small features to set their games apart in any way.


*Why?* No one wants to see motion gaming because no good games use it, and reactionary. 


I can completely acknowledge that if you’re forced into controlling one way or another (as mentioned with my critique of lack of mapping abilities in general) you’re going to be upset. When you’re forced to use gestures and motion gaming you may become bitter towards them

I followed the development of FF XIV and was excited when it was released. At the time my computer couldn't handle it and it was available on my PS3 so I didn't end up playing it. As we all know it was slammed for being buggy

1372436203.0,1h97fz,An idea for a death system in a linear game.,Senile57,500,143,154,"I was playing Fallout New Vegas the other day, and realized this problem seemed to be widespread. There's the Bethesda way (just using Bethesda games as an example), in which if you die

So, we have this hypothetical game, lets call it Man Shooter. It's a linear Stealth-Action game. You start the game off as a normal person, who gets caught up in events far larger than him (I haven't really thought about the story much.) You have some sort of connection to the main villain, maybe you were his childhood friend, or brother, or something. Playing as this character throughout the game will result in a very stealthy play through, traits, you will reach the end of the game, and the game will end. A very satisfying ending.

However, and you will switch to a new character. Say if you died in a burning building, you will switch to a firefighter rushing to put out the blaze, for example. This firefighter will find your old characters body, and maybe find an object or a note on your old characters body that encourages him to follow the story. Now, here's the crucial part. That firefighter would have a different play style, and a different ending. The play style would be more leaning towards action and less towards stealth, for example, so he won't explain anything. This will leave some ambiguity in the ending

Then, say a SWAT soldier for example. His play style will basically be to go in and shoot stuff, and his ending will be the general saying ""Well done, soldier. Get back to base!"", or something along those lines. The punishment for you screwing up too many times will be a worse ending because of who you're character is, and the circumstances of the story, instead of the ""Bad Karma"" ending in the Fallout games which is triggered by having enough negative karma points. These are all just examples, and more personality

I think this sort of system would make some games a lot more interesting. It may lead itself to a more complex story, which seems to be something linear games like CoD and so forth are lacking in.

Would there be serious problems with this idea? Would it ruin the story to be constantly jumping around? Is encouraging flawless

It goes without saying that, not as many developers working with the hardware. To date, I still consider Rogue Squadron: Rogue Leader one of its best looking games on the console despite it being a release day game.

1355672689.0,14xzlx,Where is the SEGA of old? The Answer,nuggahrs,465,108,64,"Many gamers remember the time when Sega had individually named studios with lots of creative efforts

Sonic Team with games like Chu Chu Rocket, PSO for games other then Sonic.
AM2 with Shenmue, Panzer Dragoon. Hitmaker with Crazy Taxi and Virtua Tennis. Amusment Vision with Monkey Ball and F-Zero GX. Overworks with Skies of Arcadia and the PS2 Shinobi. WOW with Sega GT, House of the Dead, Golden Axe and Streets of Rage.

After 2004 when the Dreamcast went out and games that were most likely to have come out on Dreamcast ran out, reshuffled and their output was different, many people were confused, and what happened to the Teams and what have they been making since then?

Here's what happened

Back then all the (8) Teams were making Games for Consoles and Arcades.

Now it's split up between Consumer (gaming devices) and Amusment (Arcades) Divisions. 

Sonic Team got merged with UGA. The UGA people being behind the Music games on the Dreamcast. Mizuguchi who was part of UGA didn't like that, a parody plattformer only for WiiWare in Japan. The rythum game division from the people that made Space Channel 5 and Samba de Amigo, went on to make the Hatsune Miku games, and Rythm Thief as a one off. Also the Sonic Riders games were also the Idea of the former UGA Studios, probably not intented being Sonic games.
Phantasy Star games

Smilebit and Amusment Visionwent and key members of the Shenmue Team on to make the Yakuza and Super Monkey Ball games

Overworks still makes JRPG's after Skies of Arcadia

People wonder why Sega hasn't been making any Action games anymore like Streets of Rage and Golden Axe or even the controversial Shinobi game on PS2.
There were beat-em-ups made by AM3 and Amusment Vision

Now the Arcade Divisions
While back then Arcade ports were common on Sega consoles since they exactly like their Arcade units. Now it's not anymore.
Sega still makes Rail-Shooters and Racing games and we got a spiritual successor to Virtual-On
The only home ports that we've got are the Virtua Fighter and Tennis games. And also the reimagining of After Burner.
Look through the catalouge here. Since Lindbergh is were games were rarely ported anymore. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Sega_arcade_games

1363624326.0,1aj4z6,What are some games you've played that received criticism unfairly because it seems like the reviewers weren't playing it right?,Greenskeeper,485,132,970,"I know, so I eagerly jumped right into it once I beat the first.

Honestly

AC1 is a stealth game. At least, and I finished Devil May Cry 3 right before this game, which is praised for its complex combat system. This combat is simple and repetitive, but the game heavily suggests that you should use your hidden knife as much as you can to avoid drawn-out combat. Assassination missions go as you swayed them to go. When I failed a mission, it felt like my fault and I had to change my strategy.

As for combat, but he's only one man, and fighting 10+ guards wasn't a breeze. There was actually some strategy to it, should I make the first move or wait and counter? I did like in AC2, however, you could still do hidden blade take-downs once combat has engaged.

What almost ruined AC2 for me were the tutorials. Granted, this is something I really loathe in modern games. When developers make a big game they find it necessary to spell out how everything works. But in AC1, the tutorials were optional, and you learned the game mechanics by just playing the game.

I eventually let AC2 sink its teeth into me, while I went into AC2 expecting everything to be improved, which, ultimately I got, but it was presented in a more gradual pacing that nearly killed it for me. It also didn't help that it's a completely different type of game altogether. AC2 is not a stealth game. You never need stealth, your opponents can get killed in a colorful myriad of methods, and you never feel over-powered, because game play felt scripted.

I'm going to try to explain all the major parts of the game as briefly as possible, you awake in the den of a ruthless and manipulative trader, who tasks you with increasingly reckless and dangerous missions in exchange for information about your past. All you know about who you were is what was left on your PDA, a single task left on your to-do list: KILL THE STRELOK.

Navigating through the twisted and blasted Zone is a treacherous feat: the wilderness is dotted with bizarre 'anomalies', or you might just burst into flames. Hidden in these anomalies are even stranger artifacts, odd oblong lumps of matter that, when held close to your skin, grant mixed blessings: Your skin might resist penetration by gunfire, but your blood is thinner, and therefore you bleed out quicker. Additionally, terrifying mutants

As you progress through the game, you reach a critical point in the game, where you must enter a region known as the 'Brain Scorcher'. It got this name for the fact that, for whatever reason, anyone who goes there is either killed outright or turned into a mumbling, shambling invalid. No one comes out.

You have an edge

Though you must wade through some of the toughest combat in the game, the heart of the disaster: the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Throughout the city, the incredibly valuable artifacts are up for grabs.

Every faction surges to the city, you'll find yourself inside a secret chamber within the Chernobyl NPP. Here, in a vault bathed in radioactivity, you're greeted by a hologram composite of many scientists. It greets you. ""Hello, Strelok.""

That's the reveal. You are strelok

*In the aftermath of the Chernobyl disaster, and the eventual formation of a hivemind of seven neurally linked scientists known as the C-Consciousness. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the self-aware C-Consciousness took control of the Zone and continued its research. It attempted to bring about world peace through global mind control by directly interacting with the noosphere; however, these attempts resulted in the unintentional twisting of the physical terrain around Chernobyl as well as the mutation of resident life forms, creating the Zone. In an attempt to hide its existence the C-Consciousness created the two Brain Scorcher fields and erected a Monolith artifact - the Wish Granter - in the center of the Zone, which it uses to brainwash any stalkers who reach it; brainwashed stalkers are tattooed with the ""S.T.A.L.K.E.R."" acronym and reprogrammed to serve the C-Consciousness.

Rumors of the Wish Granter began to spread throughout the Zone. A group of four stalkers (Strelok, and Doc) attempted to reach the Wish Granter, but after encountering the fanatical Monolith faction they were forced to retreat. Strelok was knocked unconscious during a ""blowout"" while the others were able to escape. On the way back Fang was killed by a sniper in Pripyat; some time later Ghost was killed in the Brain Scorcher control facility under Yantar.

The unconscious Strelok was discovered by the C-Consciousness; unaware of his identity

Once the C-Consciousness has finished answering Marked One/Strelok's questions he is given a choice: merge with the C-Consciousness to ensure its continued existence

Afterward Strelok is shown standing in a grassy field, he is happy that he survived.*

Gabe's idea of educating parents on these things through the PTA is fantastic.  Even if it was only to show them how to use the parental settings on current consoles.  I'll let you all read it for yourself:

""I’ve gone into my son’s school to teach cartooning since he was in Kindergarten. He’s in second grade now and it’s still something I look forward to every year. I really love working with kids and teaching art. It usually ends up making for some good Penny Arcade comics too.

Aside from me calling some dude on the phone

My first reaction when I see something like the Katie Couric special or the NRA rant against games is to get pissed off. When I hear stories about a kid playing a game for 72 hours straight I don’t want to ban violent games

What I proposed is a hour long session in which I would teach parents about the ESRB rating system but that’s just the beginning. I would also talk about the games I know their kids are playing and the games they want to play. I’d talk about Minecraft and what sorts of things playing on a public server might expose them to. Hell I bet lots of them don’t even understand the concept of a public server. I can tell them How Xbox live works and what their kids might be hearing when they have that headset on. I’d talk about games that are great to play WITH your kids and maybe even give some ideas for games that they as adults might enjoy. Listen I understand that being a parent is hard. Sometimes you just don’t have all the info and maybe you don’t know how to find it. Well in this one specific instance I can help.

So I decided that my way of doing something is to educate. The PTA got back to me and they like the idea. We’re working out the details now and I’m really excited. Maybe I can help some parents understand games better and possibly even connect with their kids in a new way.

I don't want to discuss the merits/flaws of the game or suggest people try it again

The first time I played was my typical completionist style. I would arrive in a town, Dragon's Age or WoW, but got very frustrating in Skyrim because I would pick up a few new quests whenever I went out to finish one and it became this never ending grind of quests/areas that all started to seem quite similar/shallow. My agency was as a player playing a game and my motivation was to experience all the content.

This weekend, and then I reacted to quests based on that motivation. I didn't talk to anyone in Helgen after the Stormclock's sister asked me to tell the Jarl about the dragon, because there was no time to muck around. I stuck to the main questline, taking only brief detours when the main quest wasn't urgent. I enjoyed it significantly more than the first time, the experience did not feel shallow (because I was not trying to complete dozens of similar quests/areas), and I think I could replay it as different characters taking different paths to have a different experience each time.

A company develops a game that is released to critical acclaim and, commercial success.

Even if, for whatever reason, they acquiesce, and stick with the company while making the same games over and over for years, eventually, and leave to do their own thing on their own terms. 

Yuji Naka was the lead programmer of Sonic 1

Keiji Inafune was a top dog at Capcom, quit, and founded Comcept.

But, I got my hands on Dishonored last week, and I loved the stealth, that's not quite satisfying my stealthy-gameplay cravings right now, so I thought - well

The thing is... Adam Jensen is not a happy person, really drives that under your own skin - you start feeling kind of sad for the dude, and his cold, monotone voice starts to seem more and more like a mask for someone who's dealing with plenty of emotional damage of his own. And I'm not talking about the big things that are revealed about him through the story, no - if you look hard enough, you can catch a lot of sad, sad details about this man, I found myself actually getting excited about him - his life would finally stop looking so grim and dark.

And when that passed, ""Did that really happen? Did I just react in this game, not for the game's sake? Damn.""

And they deal with it in a very realistic way.

Even Adam Jensen has had his own life, have come for just a short period of time, and this life of his, continues, after you're gone. It's really rewarding, to see this dark personality for what it truly is - a good, compassionate man, trying to hold it together, that is. I mean, and I don't know what your views on the topic of letting yourself be engulfed by a story are

To anyone who hasn't yet played the game - do it. And pay attention to the details; check every computer terminal you come across, in my opinion. The game really made me feel like the main character, and it made me attached to the characters in his life - not many games can do that.

Rockstar's human physics/reactions in GTA IV, the way their feet dynamically walk and turn, it is ridiculous.

Heavy Rain's story arks and consequences for your actions are something I always feel every story driven game is lacking. The fact that there's no checkpoints and everything you do is final makes it insanely intense and redefines the risk/reward system in gaming. Other games like The Walking Dead attempt to do this

Mirror's Edge's parkour was so great it was basically what made the game what is was. I feel that every First Person game would benefit from a system like it or at least a toned down one. I know Brink tried it, and I feel that's a huge step in the wrong direction for gaming.

**C**ontemplative – **R**eactive


This is dependent on how much time the player has to make decisions. At the far ends of the spectrum, where there are no bounds whatsoever on how long you have to make a decision in almost all cases.


**A**vatar – **D**irect


Games are Avatar games if there is an object on screen to represent the player. If they are acting directly on the world, as not all objects the player is able to move or manipulate are necessarily avatars.


**E**nemies – **O**bstacles


This depends on whether the player must overcome the environment/circumstances, and are thus more like obstacles than enemies. As there are many games which focus tightly on combat with enemies, it is safe to be strict with this categorization.


**T**uned – **S**tatic


If the player significantly alters their avatar, then it is a Tuned game. In Static games, while the player may gain new abilities, they do not manage an inventory or adjust a range of qualities, and play the game more or less as is. Often, new abilities or “power-ups” in static games are not controlled or altered by the player, who has little control over which power up is applied and when.

It is true that some categories, games are rarely simple enough to fit into one category or another without some argument being present.

By designing
describe it.
 
In designing the game, cities, and entire game worlds.
 
I've been kicking around the name 'Last Nation of Man'.  
 
The story is set as a demonic horde threatens the last stronghold of mankind, fallen nations (which are,  basically, Tibetans, jungle Māori, and Mongols). The players must build a society robust enough to hold off the serious threat of being overrun by the demons despite the player base being divided into four nations which have a history of conflict. 
 
That's the premise of the plot
 
* Like Natural Selection
* Dynastic permadeath: There has been a trend in recent years to embrace permadeath as an enhancement to gameplay. The system in LNoM would be somewhat similar to the succession system in the grand strategy game Crusader Kings 2. When your character dies, since you will eventually play as one of your heirs, you also must invest in developing their character through training and discipline. 
* Persistent world: When you log out of the game, a player could hire out his character to another trusted players for the period you are offline. Much of the grinding of traditional MMOs is eliminated by this system. If possible, the game would cross platforms in that a smartphone app would allow you to control your character even if you are away from your computer. While this wouldn't simulate the same experience as playing the game, you'd be able to update your character's orders on the fly and respond to requests from players in the game relayed to you through the app.
* Combat system: The combat system is the area where I'm most unsure about the feasibility of my ideas. The main inspiration for the combat system is the 2001 computer game, e.g. you could have the robot swing its sword in a certain manner when its sensors indicated the enemy robot was directly in front of your robot (give or take 10 degrees) and standing within 3 meters of your player. In LNoM, you'd be able to develop new moves in a practice space and test them in sparring matches. For a given starting positions, you would develop a set of two animations which could be initiated by the right or left mouse button. Groups of these animations would develop corresponding to a 'combat school' that has a complete set of movement choices that a player may need in combat. Players could switch between the combat schools there character is trained in on the fly in order to change their style to suit the situation. As you maneuver around a combat space relative to your opponent, you could choose to trigger one of the two combat maneuvers that are queued up for that situation. The fight plays out as a branching tree of choices of attacks and maneuvers. The player would have to be in tune with their character as clicking either of the buttons again or commanding certain movements during the attack animation would cancel it to start a new one; players would need to know which move to use in a situation, when to initiate it, and how to avoid disrupting their character’s movements. The system would also take into account your stance (which you could split between standing and crouching) and your movements (running at enemy vs. running past them right to left
* Creating moves: The combat system is built by combining smaller animations such as thrusts, the abilities of the character will be factored in to allow the character to be reactive during combat by, for example, designating an angle from which to be prepared to block attacks at a point in the move. It's difficult to explain concisely, but I do have a sense for how this would work and I think it could be a very fun system that could lead to spectacular fights. 
* Incentivizing political strife: The entrenched political elite of Ardatha are struggling to preserve their position in society despite the demons and refugees flooding across the border. The great families of the game struggle to control the Ardathian Senate in order to impose laws binding on all characters and enforced by the Army. They have to choose how they handle the integration of the other nations into their new society; an essential task if they hope to fend off the demons. Since think pay-to-play model is a great way to ensure that the general player base resents the power of the elite
* Player-built world: The game world will be built by the players. We've seen how people love games where they can build a world. The geography of the world may be rebuilt but players design and build the structures which occupy the game world. They also can build characters which will then be made available for auction at the beginning of the game. Instead of spending time on level design
* Procedurally generated maps: The terrain and structures outside of Ardathan territory would be a procedurally generated. These areas would follow broad terrain type guidelines but would place player built levels on the map at appropriate places (e.g. an abandoned temple in the jungle). Chests could be placed in the game and randomly allocated loot by the game engine. You will have to be on guard for demons when you enter this no-man’s land as demons will be spawned nearby as you venture into their territory.
* Fully player-driven economy: The functioning of the economy would be totally player driven. Everything which an adventurer finds in demon territory is just raw material for a skilled craftsmen. Additionally, die if they do not have food. The entire city could starve to death if the demons manage to destroy its farms.
* Variable technology tree: Scholars, sell training to other players, or, perhaps, work to establish a monopoly in the area they make a discovery. Importantly, the power of the skills or items unlocked by a particular discovery and the mechanisms and prerequisites for making a discovery would be randomized in each iteration of the world. Each game would be a unique experience as strategies and skills developed in one world may be useless in another with different rules. Some discoveries may require simply the appropriate mixing of ingredients while others may require elaborate laboratories or vivisections of captured demons.
*Everything Dies: Every character will age and, not less. Moreover, whole game worlds can die out; if the Demons manage to take and hold Ardatha, that game world disappears. Survival means holding off ever intensifying demonic attacks and any lapse in the defense could be the end of the gam world as we know it.
 
There are some other mechanics I'd like to implement related to gossip/publishing and social networks, as well as the back story of the game, but I’d like this post to be closer in length to a short story than a novella.
 
Just to reiterate
 
This game would try to find drama in the more basic levels of human existence. You struggle to feed and shelter your family. Once those basic needs are meant you may choose to devote your life to discovering the workings of the universe, or leading raids to destroy demonic shrines on the border. The game would feel like a real place where events are constantly occurring and changing the gaming experience for the players.
 
I'd love to hear what everyone thinks about it. Do you think the game mechanics could work? Would you play the game?

I'm a long time Nintendo fan, it's not so much about the quality (which is superb as usual), but, the complete lack of risk taking. 

Someone on /r/gaming said that what does it matter if a game feels like Zelda and is dressed up as something different, or lack there of rather, needs to change. I feel that the dependence on formula (particularly with Zelda, following a character from village to killing Ganondorf) might change if they allowed some serialized storytelling. Personally, Majora's Mask always struck me as the most interesting, and that's because Ocarina of Time covered the origin story. 

I'm happy with their gameplay, and by allowing some writing into the equation, they might come up with new situations.

In a straight up action game this isn't a big deal, your kill count will be in the hundreds. To be honest, it's not really at odds with the story or the character of Niko Bellic that he kills men, but the quantity of men killed is just extreme. 

Some other games that suffer from this issue are Red Dead Redemption and Uncharted. Red Dead Redemption is similar to GTA where the John Marston is not exactly a good guy, and apparently he does express the desire not to kill (I've only played the first) but you still kill plenty of bad guys. I feel it poses a particular problem when an important companion dies and the main character is supposed to feel righteous anger about it. Wouldn't the bad guys be just as justified in their desire to kill the MC given that he's killed dozens of their friends?

I understand that for games to be fun

1348463020.0,10do1m,On Torchlight 2 vs Diablo 3,Kaires,457,147,346,"I've played about 20 hours of Torchlight 2 so far and well over two hundred for Diablo 3 (though I’ve quit).
Graphically, I am a huge fan of steampunk, so I actually liked the Torchlight environment more, but I’m trying to keep this as objective as possible. The environment in Diablo 3 was much darker than Torchlight 2, and the graphics and music really added to the mood. Torchlight 2 had darker music and themes, but the color scheme and monster appearance really conflicted with it. 
Combat wise, however the feeling that your character could do so much more had they been able to use the skills they should theoretically have makes Diablo 3 much less immersive.

In Diablo 3, critical chance and your primary stat. If you were building defensive, get health and resistance. However in Torchlight 2, the stats got much more interesting. It was very difficult to decide what to add, all four stats are necessary for all characters. All characters have their damage and critical damage influenced by strength, critical change and dodge by dexterity, et cetera. While playing as an outlander, to boost by poison damage and execution chance (for double pistols) or to boost strength. In any case

As far as the campaign goes, and repetitive. There is virtually only one way to play each class, and to fully level your character; you need to play through the game the exact same way four times. As well as that, the actual playtime of one run through is very short, and definitely not enough to justify the 60 dollar price-tag. It took me about 8 hours to finish the first time. Torchlight 2 on the other hand, has a much more complete gameplay experience, with side-quests and interesting exploration. Diablo 3 felt more linear (which in my opinion is bad for a dungeon crawler) and didn't cater much to exploration of any type.

Equipment drop in Diablo 3 and Torchlight 2 are wildly different. In Torchlight, so there isn't a random factor when it comes to endgame equipment. In Diablo 3, there is a random generation of stats for the best items (including sets). Torchlight 2 rewards the player more often (as it should without an auction house), whereas Diablo 3 rewards more at once, but far less often. Both systems work well, as you can obtain good equipment via Auction House in Diablo 3. The only point I would criticize either system is that in Diablo 3, the Auction House prices were incredibly inflated due to gold botters/farmers.

Item enhancement in Torchlight 2 far outclassed that of Diablo 3. To enchant an item to full potential, item enhancement was incredibly shallow, some items came with sockets that you could put gems into (there were only actually 4 kinds of gems). The gem system in Torchlight 2 is more interesting, with a wide variety of gem choices to buff your character in different ways (as well as interesting side effects, e.g. chance to cast a spell on attack, et cetera).

Both games had a follower system. Diablo 3 used another person, used pets. The pet system was far more interesting. The pets had an entirely new inventory, and the player could teach them skills. You could also send it back to town with a shopping list, which was quite useless (since if you had a portal with you, you could just go back yourself). But the main thing about pets in Torchlight 2 was that they actually did something. When playing Diablo 3 I didn’t feel as though my follower was useful at all (the Enchanter provided stat boosts, but that’s the extent of it). In Torchlight 2, your pet can act as a monster magnet, whereas followers in Diablo 3 were so weak and squishy that it didn’t even feel like they were there.

One aspect of gameplay that Diablo 3 did better than Torchlight 2 was resources management. In Diablo 3, and the charge/spend aspect of different skills made the gameplay feel smooth. In Torchlight 2, you had a small mana pool (even as a mage, you could only have 10 or so spells before running dry), and after running out you had only the option to either attack normally with whacks or plain shots, or run away until your mana was back (in the case of mages). There was the charge bar system, but that was only remotely interesting in the case of Engineer. 

I haven’t yet had a chance to experience Torchlight 2 in multiplayer, you’ll do fine. This makes it essentially the same as single player.

Diablo 3 had a very shitty endgame. Inferno farming was boring and somewhat easy. The balance between classes was catastrophic. The stats weren’t flexible, Torchlight 2 had much more variety in dungeon generation, stat distribution and build types., which increases both the endgame fun of a character, and the replay value as another class or build. 

These of course are just aspects of the gameplay. Company decisions on DRM or item distribution also impact the games, this is just about the games themselves. I’ve seen many people posting about how the lack of DRM makes Torchlight 2 the better game, or that the only argument about Diablo 3 being a worse game is AH and DRM. This is meant to be an objective comparison between the two games.

For books

For movies

For TV shows, the protagonist is in a horrible situation as he's driving in the middle of the desert with bodies and chemicals moving around in the back of an RV, only to lead to his final goodbyes to his family before he's allegedly caught or dead, all within the first few minutes of the show.

Now, or now with a remote or their own body, ready to command whatever the game has in store for them. There are more variables to account for in the opening of games in comparison to any other entertainment media.

When games first started, the player had full control over this ""Mario"" character and found out certain activities and commands executed would lead to a higher score, punishment for mistakes, and ultimately, progression towards finishing the game. The first level to Super Mario Bros. can still be remembered block by block, pipe by pipe, enemy by enemy by veteran players of said-game just from how this style of immersion worked. Many gamers to this day prefer this style of an opener to games because of how well it can be executed: here's the game

A more modern (sorry for the pun) example that not many would consider of this kind of style is Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. Not the tutorial in the very beginning, an enemy jet fires at you and your squad must then escape before being dragged into the ocean. Only after you narrowly get passed a broken catwalk, navigate through flooding hallways, and jump back onto the helicopter before slipping off a sinking ship on its side do you finally see the title of the game. Granted, this example comes from a franchise not much gamers consider very good at all in comparison to more recent games, but I felt this example connected best with the gameplay-style of immersion to get the player into the game.

As I said earlier, I believe, is Bioshock. You see yourself survive a plane crash in the middle of the ocean, only to somehow find a lighthouse that leads to the entrance of the grand underwater utopia of Rapture, or what was left of it. During this, you could only move, look around, and later than that

A second example of the ""take it piece by piece"" approach is Mass Effect 2, you can only move, look around, and choose a few dialogue options as your ship burns, even with you dying after the last of the crew escapes the wreckage. Again, despite the lack of gameplay presented right away, the player never feels restricted as the events in the game are happening at such a scale that if all mechanics were presented, since it did exactly this). 

Anyway, or do you have a different opinion on what makes an opening level a great level?

At the same time there have been countless research publications in the field of urban planning and city analysis. all of the parts are there

The first, but It's mostly passed for most players as the servers have come back online and while many people still have issues with losing internet connections, there are now offline play patches on the pirate bay. I won't beat this dead horse. Instead I will focus on the actual game itself:

PATHFINDING - Pathfinding is absolutely the first and most noticeable failure of the iname mechanics. Pathfinding is not too complicates, 3d for DECADES. SimCity's team should have had a great deal of expertise in this area, even if traffic was statistically generated completely in older sim games. This is one of the core elements of ANY city. How do I get to work? How do I get home? should I take the subway or the car? Will the highway be more congested than the smaller road? should I hop on the turnpike for longer drives? Pathfinding in SimCity.
Sims do not even calculate Shortest-distance roads correctly. Sims Re-calculate their route every few seconds, which leads to sims wandering roads for days or getting stuck in infinite traffic loops. 
Sims also have a STRONG Right-turn bias. If given the choice between three paths of identical distance through the middle (one zig zagged


Traffic - There's no subways. Vehicles will occasionally permanently stop in the road blocking traffic forever. You will most likely have to bulldoze that strip of road to correct the problem. Even if sims get to work by public transit
The game also needs More freedom in creating your road network (overpasses

Road construction: The game needs More transit options such as half intersections, subways, elevated rail, bus lanes (avenue bus stops should be offset to not interfere with through traffic), bus rapid transit lines, intracity highways (official, not modded), comes with intracity highways), different types of road material (plain asphalt instead of dirt, walking trails/bike paths (with a park system that utilized them)
Land Area: A SimCity city is approximately 1.2 miles square

Absolutely idiotic Sim AI and behaviour - -makes planning a city like you would expect a city to function completely impossible. This is a problem so bad that I really can't sum it up in this post
http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1a7vzj/sims_agents_observation/

http://www.reddit.com/r/SimCity/comments/1akjhh/sims_agents_observation_part_6_mass_transit/

Population calculation: After you hit around 500 people, they do not live anywhere, they are not simulated on roads, they do not pay taxes, but they still contribute to the costs of your services. This causes artificial inflation of the stated size of a city and makes growing larger cities impossible. Regardless of this being a bad thing or not, this breaks the GlassBox promise of a 1:1 ""What You See Is What You Simulate"" simulation.

Land value - high desirability should not just be triggered by parks and civic buildings. SimCity COMPLETELY disregards factors like proximity to rivers/lakes/beaches, such as nearness to the shoreline, to add value. Makes no sense to have shacks on the waterfront and mansions in the center of town that happen to sit across from city hall in high crime zones. Similarly having a clean river should confer bonuses to land value while Polluted rivers confer detractions. 

Ground textures - Ploppable objects, deep green. Undeveloped land has a hue of a much brighter green (or brown). Why the fuck? They look stupid next to each other.

Plopped objects - Ploppables intersect with sims can trap sims permanently
You're also unable to build ploppables on top of fences, or other scrap leftovers from previously demolished items which were never cleaned up. If this is supposed to be a feature, at least implement a city cleanup service crew which patrols the city carrying off this waste.
Overall it'd be best to see more Ploppables on the whole like Grand central stations, military installations, private schools, churches, cemeteries, seaports, marinas, golf courses, courthouses

Property shape/no autofill - Ungainly wedges form when placing anything on an angle or a curve. These inscribed spaces yield unusable land, or provide an autofill like automatic placement of objects associated with your city's theme in that space

Regioning: The region system is hopelessly broken. Besides the fact that cities are only directly linked in four-city clusters for game interaction purposes, Upgrades to the great hall do not confer benefits to the other cities of the region as they are supposed to. 

UNDOING MISTAKES - There is no way to reload older versions of your game to undo big mistakes. There isn't even an option to restart a city from scratch. what the hell? At least give players a planning mode. Real urban planners don't plan now and demolish and try again usually

Player/Regional Accountability - the ability to grief a region by bankrupting cities or mess with other players by polluting upwind is an absolute menace. During the beta previews

Resource scarcity - this is the most instantly fixable thing I can think of. Ore shortages might make a bit of sense in a ""fuck you, some mines have been in operation for thousands of years in reality). Water supply diminishment is the worst example of this scarcity, and rain is scarce beyond any realistic scenario. Are all Sim cities built in deserts covered with fake trees and astroturf? it is entirely ridiculous and will ultimately doom a city. This can be alleviated by placing a pump near a sewage treatment plant, But it is also mentioned that the treated outflow goes back into the water table (rather than the pipes, which makes little sense), SimCity 4 and 3k had handled this perfectly by actually using the water grid laid by the player. Why was this broken when all of the logic to do this correctly already existed? Meanwhile Oil supply of ""1 month left"" can last several years and doesn't ever seem to hit zero. 


Statistics availability - How many commuters exist citywide vs. bus capacity? How many workers exist in that building? SimCity is extremely disappointing in providing useful, but this is not the case. Etc. etc.

Emergency services - Partly as a result of the terrible pathfinding, you have 10 fires around the city? Let me send 20 trucks to one fire]. I want the option to flag emergencies for police/fire/rescue vehicles a la tropico. 
Service Vehicles Drive in packs as well

Unrealistic development rates - If the density of my city would not sustain or justify a skyscraper, why are commercial structures appearing at all if the demand for them is zero?

Employment/industry - Unlike earlier sim Games, Shoppers are counted as workers while they are shopping. Workers similarly stop being workers when they leave their job. 

Specialisation of workforce/production - This is closely tied to the issue of the next problem. There's very few specialisations for workers to take up (Agricultural, textiles, etc), and very few practical things your city can produce for sale [Computers seem to be ridiculously overvalues]. Why can't you combine meats and processed foods into TV dinners like you can when producing processors? There's very little attention to detail in the network of exchange involved in an economy. 

NO JOB PERMANENCE - this is quite possibly one of the BIGGEST flaws in the game. Sims do not keep the same job from one day to the next. If you follow a sim in his daily routine, so the computer has to calculate a new preferred route, Each. and. every. time. 

Lack of useful, like the original Maxis did? How about this: 
1. Traffic woes? If you have a university with the superconductor upgrade
Or - 2. Ground pollution
3. Labor shortages? Play bad mayor and gain a little ""ostensibly-legitimate help"" in the form of a stream of overseas workers. Play good mayor and research the robotic assembly line project. 
Why should the game stick us with challenges and no way to address them? At the very least this is an area where simple access to the game for player scripted mods would have allowed the community to fill very quickly. 

No ordinances/edicts - I want to initiate public policies with real trade-offs in the form of virtues vs. consequences. Recycling mandate: Citizens are required to sort their garbage into llama-proof recycling bins (bins themselves non-recyclable). Approval -%2; garbage yielded -15%. Or, +0.5% residential tax income) then let it be a reward to mayors... instead of getting gifted with do-nothing microsoft-style achievements that no one cares about and don't actually represent any achieving.
I can't be the only one who would prefer In-depth and additional economic options and ordinances. Options like requiring drivers have ""licenses"", etc.

Modifiable service and civic buildings -- that fundamentally look the same - I want to see new skins. Variants, so as to make them potentially taller. Wider. As is, the city hall moddability is pretty cool, as well as the elementary school's.

Parks - They're shit. It'd be much better to give people different ""elements"" like swing sets or little rivers and bridges and terrain tools to create different parks which appeal to different Sim demographics in different degrees. At least offer small puzzle pieces to mix and match to make bigger parks dynamically. 

Terraforming utilities [or lack thereof] - The game is missing them

Stunning lack of variety in city events. 

Working educational system - High schools and elementary schools should be required. Their coverage would then affect a drop-out vs high school graduate metric. Can't afford them? You're going to have a shitty-ass set of schools with shitty-ass students. Think institutional shack-and-brick where you rape student families for hot lunches and prom tickets. As to Colleges and Universities - their placement would impact the percentage of higher-ed graduates (obviously) which would have a direct effect on industry type, we should have the ability to set tuition and fees which would also affect graduation rates. (Too expensive, fewer graduates.) Again, statistics. As it stands Education is an incoherent mess, and student sims are also nomads like their parents. 

Road-laying difficulties - Draw roads around a building imperfectly -- and prepare for weirdness in the form of giant odd loops, it's annoying. Roads should snap to structures as they do grids, and make it easy to continue in a 90 degree manner around buildings. Cross-roads are also tirelessly fussy when it comes to forming intersections if the existing road-ends aren't perfectly aligned. Or they intersect at bad angles. Solution - Roads should have a ""snap-to"" key, such as shift, which communicates the will of the player for ""straightness"" which conforms to the shape of structures and which would also fill in any gaps from roads you intend to intersect that happen to fall a bit short. 

Dynamic city changes only partially implemented - Noticing the solar panels appearing on some structures within ""green"" cities, etc. etc.? Are the solar panels really it? What happened to the rest of it? How about changes to roads, signs, or anything else that might convey an identity to the work you've done? this was one of the cooler features a lot of us had been looking forward to

Buildings require Roads. Always. Roads can't be deleted unless the resource they're attached to is deleted. So if you want to remake a service road you have to delete the utility it connects to. It makes it a fucking nightmare when you want to re-road your city

The Mayor Should be Corruptible - As far as I know, but it also rewarded you for stealing money from the treasury, making back room deals, imprisoning your rivals, and otherwise enriching yourself at the polity’s expense, or sacrificing some of the population for the good of the whole. This is one of the elements that's made tropico so much more plausible from a political point of view than SimCity

The Game Should Ask Deeper Questions of Environmental Consequence -
In general, but otherwise very little was lost when you built a giant new highway interchange or industrial park. Meanwhile, although pollution has existed, there are only two kinds of pollution: “air” and “water"". In today’s world of environmental controversies and citizen activism, the standard SimCity approach seems more and more dated and simplistic.

It would be better, light pollution, noise pollution, and other forms of city-impact. Also, it would make the game more dynamic if the city planner had to occasionally fight environmentalists to gain access to new land, or on the flip side, to restore wetlands to protect against storm surges, previous versions of the game made natural disasters totally random.

For me personally

I wonder, I will always get bored or annoyed with a game that isn't younger than 3-4 years. The problem is, I can't even put the finger on what exactly turns me off from playing them.

The problem intensifies when I change platform. While moving I found my old Xbox and Halo 1. After moving I hooked it up and tried to play Halo 1

An even better example for this would be Mass Effect 1 and 2. I think that Mass Effect 1 and 2 are better in storyline than ME3 (they mucked up the Reaper story so hard imho) and I even liked the way you progress through the story better (I didn't like the readiness mechanic at all). Still

Another great example could be SW: KotOR 1 and 2. KotOR1 is in my top 5 games of all time, because mechanics and graphics were such a big turnoff. Somehow the magic is gone from back then. I cannot reproduce and sort of immersion. My immersion feeling is not even generated at all or constantly breaking due to looks or how it plays. KotOR 2 on the other hand, many people favor over KotOr 1 (never played it, because I didn't have a system to run KotOR 2 at release), but I cannot play it. Can't even got past the first level. It feels like a really big book that I cannot get through the first 100 pages to get invested enough into the story/characters to stick it out.

Anyone have similar problems or explanations for this?

1332000655.0,r0waz,BioWare in full PR damage control. A professional's take.,MyCoolYoungHistory,436,138,233,"Here is a post on BSN regarding BioWare's response by an individual who worked in the PR realm.  


&gt;I don't think Bioware is out of touch with their customers though I agree with an earlier poster that right now they are assessing their options. Nor do I think that everyone speaking up for them at the moment is a ""yes man"" or shill. That said:  


&gt;I don't for a moment think there are any other endings, they are letting people vent. Secondly, they are weighing options.
Years ago, then try and define the detractors in the mainstream with things like ""this is all a big mistunderstand"", etc. while remaining civil in the hopes the detractors go rabid. Meanwhile go dark and use countermeasures through third part sources to prop up your position and brand the outcry as driven by hacks, haters or a minority trying to wear out the detractors on these outlets or ""shock troops"" while protecting the corporate core. Next, offer something distracting (notice SWTOR is free this upcoming weekend) known as the ""faux olive branch""/ask the angry people to explain their concerns (without agreeing to commit to a compromise), buy more add time (definitely going on right now), and hope it dies down. If the pressure is still on


&gt;If it is any consolation, won't be made by the writers so illusions to things they wanted to convey don't matter much atm (to wit: the leads comments yesterday). I suspect he's been called in and politely told by the PR guys to not do that again. This is now a corporate problem, not an artistic struggle with fans. Somewhere in the EA bunker, attorneys, PR guys, writers and brass are sharing numbers b/c in the end this will come down to hard currency.  


&gt;As one who despises the endings


Later he posted:  


&gt;Greetings All


&gt;First


&gt;A couple follow-up thoughts for those wondering what is likely going on with the other side of the mirror in the last couple days:  


&gt;First, and the recent noncommittal overtures to listen are faux olive branches. Sorry. Customers intrinsically want to believe companies they patronize listen and when they stop believing that, the company has to say they are listening and do anything to get the detractors off-message. There are a dozen names for this, but the most memorable was ""The Shell Game.""  


&gt;You will know that there’s a genuine need for dialogue in the corporate bunker when the message turns from “we’re listening” to “we acknowledge we may have a disconnect with our consumers and are willing to discuss a meaningful solution to the problem.” It signals an end to non-committed deflection and opening genuine talks to solve the problem (it’s knows as “Exposing Your Throat” btw). At present


&gt;But here’s the part that amazes me as an old PR guy and is totally new. The disenfranchised base here is changing the old methodology. It’s akin to comparing old-style bunker PR defenses to new blitzkrieg-style consumers. To date, you could not mass 30,000 protesters into a networked base without some luck, money, a GREAT cause and (most importantly) time. By the time you did get organized, folks were either burned out or lost interest. Groups like Take Back have altered the landscape and suddenly the contest is taken from the old paradigm to a crazy new (and wonderful IMO) place. Preorder sales took away customers biggest weapon in the past (i.e. don’t buy the product). Now customers who feel they have received poor value have been potentially re-empowered by the internet. Bioware/EA is feeling the full brunt of this thing while passion is hottest. They are deploying countermeasures faster than the old strategies ever would have ever suggested. To some degree, they are being outmaneuvered atm. But now it depends on how long the protest/outcry holds up.  


&gt;Two more quick points and I’ll close. First, some outlets are now saying “maybe the game has problem but its still art” from the precedent message “best game ever.” That won’t fly with the mainstream. If its one thing they know is that when “art” hits the marketplace, it is a commodity, nothing more. You’ve changed the countermeasures from ""unbiased"" critics of the movement into drum beaters simply trying to get you angry. EA’s PR guys probably envy you (grudgingly) atm.  


&gt;Second, sure. But if I was sitting in an office looking at that Bioware poll, I’d be reaching for a cigarette.  


&gt;Finally remember, etc. They will watch those numbers this weekend. If sales slow, watch for price cutting within 10 days (just over the two week US release date). It will mean that retailers are getting nervous and will slow new unit orders. As I’ve said before, this will come down to hard currency. If the protests start having an effect on that front, the response will come.  


&gt;I’m an older gamer and again appreciate the repost. To everyone (on both sides) continue to let your voices be heard. You are consumers and have every right to engage in this discourse. The boards being locked yesterday proves someone is watching and knows this is an issue. I'm in the hated-ending camp to be sure


&gt;Cheers.

Games don't have to settle for one of these

Recently, perhaps unintentionally made visibility practically impossible without lights. At first I thought about making some changes in the Mod's settings, until I realised the game was better for it.

Liberty City was transformed into a dark sprawl where safety is found in the small radiuses of the street lighting. The neon lights of the club district gives colour back to the game infamous for having none. Liberty City is far more beautiful as a result

For some super-quick back-story:
Rumors of this game surfaced when it appeared on a Brazialian ratings site in the beginning of March. The original Farcry 3 writer even suggested that he was working on something slightly off the beaten path. By appearances, uploaded three cuts from the game’s soundtrack on to music-sharing site Soundcloud later the same week. After that weekend Ubisoft released another trailer as well as a release date of May 1st for all the platforms in its target demographic. It's since seen an early [underground](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_84XGrVJOaTo/TAqSxP28CKI/AAAAAAAAAsc/DkKTTGGt7zE/s1600/ALESTORM.2.jpg) release due to a mishap on Ubisoft's Uplay service and was sucessfully launched last Wednesday.

If you've played Farcry 3 then you're going to recognize a lot. You’re on a small series of islands covered with enemy compounds that you can take over to use as your own personal safe house. In fact a great deal of the game is just a re-skin of the original, unified art style. Anything worth anything is a cyber something. If it’s not black, it glows. Bright red and green beacons against a perpetual night skyline like some kind of dystopian laser-tag arena. Soldiers wearing full-face helmets with black leathers and there’s not a motorcycle in sight. I think you can see where this is going.

The call-outs to 80’s action movies don’t stop there. The moody synthesizers, and the shame is nowhere to be found. While the game does take many opportunities to ‘clue-in’ the player on the gag, the story makes enough sense to come to a reasonable enough conclusion despite it’s own twisted logic.

In contrast to the artistic license, childish fun is even found in the weapon upgrade system when you discover that you don't have to pick and choose upgrades for most weapons. Nay, in most cases you get ALL the upgrades.

Much like the original Farcry 3, but it's replacement gives a gradual curve of skills and abilities over the course of the short game allowing the player to focus more on combat, exploration and the hilarious narrative.

With gaming, and should rightfully fear nothing a game can throw at me. The worst it can do is throw cheap jump scares at me to make me close my eyes and spin the controller wildly holding down the triggers for a brief second before its gone.

Can a video game be truly scary or mentally degrading without resorting to making the weirdly shaped monster jump out of a shadow at me? Or is the point of a video game to be a hero that can't really be hurt or destroyed? Are there any games that really shy away from the jump scare and focus on your mind? I have played the usual fare that people suggest when I have alluded to this topic, Condemned, Dead Space. Dead Space and Amnesia were quite solid and worked on atmosphere for awhile before introducing enemies and jump scares. While Condemned had combat, you weren't an invincible death machine and it built a good environment that could wear on you after awhile. Silent Hill 2 is probably the only game I've really played that combines great horror elements with intense combat.

I was so intrigued by the concept that I was trying to force myself to like it repeatedly. I was tantalized particularly by the Infinite Mode which I still have yet to unlock due to the games daunting difficulty and frustrating gameplay.

It's so user unfriendly. A game literally only comprised of escort missions, aggravating boss fights, untimely walkie talkie transmissions from Otis. The only redeeming thing was the status saving every time you restarted (which is incredibly often).

I picked up another copy recently and I finally understood it. It's an arcade throwback. A masochistic game if you will. It's meant to be restarted repeatedly. You have to develop a rhythm; strive for a perfect run through. You retain your knowledge of direction, and even your status upgrades to achieve that high score. An amazingly satisfying experience.

* if you're on PC, using mouse only) to use something else to change menus, start a new game etc.

* Be clear about what 'voice' volume does - is it controlling in-game voices? voice for mp chatting? And for games

* Music volume should refer to the volume of background music

* My plea for a new, drowns out everything else, and bugs the neighbors or damages my hearing (in headpohones) if I turn up the volume enough to hear ambient/environment noises.  I've found that, in L4D1/2 for example, if I drop the weapon volume to about 10% of normal for each weapon's .wav file, I cna still hear them perfectly clearly, but I can hear and appreciate all the other sounds in the game as well.

* subtitles (most games do this now

* Please let me adjust music volume

* work with multiple monitors please - as in respecting their edges when necessary (as above)

* Allow scaling resolution...yes

* Allow selection of which audio devices to work for which purpose.

* label in the multiplayer area exactly which ports need to be opened for everything to work (and specify which for router and windows firewall)

* work without issues on 64bit windows

* Have reasonable DRM/no DRM if you can't do things at least as effectively as Steam.  

* Where possible

* don't show me doing things in cutscenes I can't do in a game.

* no invisible barriers that I can't walk through/climb over ... if you don't want me going there

* nobody likes cutscenes that randomly have you have to hit a mouse button/random key combo to do something (edit: quick-time events) ... either let me play

* Have a consistent

* don't make me watch an unskippable cutscene or tutorial - ever.  Always leave a way out/to skip.

* adjustable FOV in any FPS genre game. Seriously

* be smart about resolution changes/scaling...and don't screw up all my desktop icons

* add lan mode back in for those that need it

* local / standalone servers when and if at all possible and a valve-style means of matchmaking.  None of the automatchmaking systems work

* editors. Let us make maps, etc. if possible.  Again and again, games that develop a community through allowing editing seem to survive and remain popular much much longer than those without.  

* unlimited save games 

* .ini files to let me adjust anything you don't want 'noobs' fiddling with (e.g., fov)

Some of the more knowledgeable people will have an answer to this. Arcades are still alive in Japan, with game centers to be found in every sizeable neighborhood, next to coin laundries, subway stations, etc. Students and salarymen have developed a habit of going to the arcades before and after school or work, and during breaks, and they are the ones who sustain them.

- It feels more Battle Royale than a zombie apocalypse. Whether you like slow or fast-paced zombies it does not matter because the zombies almost have a secondary role in this game, wether you like it or not.

- Exploration is boring. Same buildings over and over all over the place  and 90% of them you can't even enter. That was the big turn-off for me at the beginning. I was running away from zombies

- Zombies are boring, I find that fast zombies was a bad choice for the game. It would have been way more interesting to have thousands of slow-moving zombies than a handful of fast ones. It would have added tension to the game, where as right now, if I'm spotted, I know I'm dead and all I've got to do is run until the zombie glitches. (I know thousands of slow zombies is probably impossible with the Arma2 engine, but hey, that's not my fault. I'm just pointing this out.)

- There's no goals. There's no motivators for players to continue to play. Oh, you can have better gear. But ultimately, for what? Kill more zombies? PvP? Even when you have the best gear, what are you supposed to do with it? I mean, the zombies ARE infinite, after all... Which leads to my next point:

- There's no interaction with the environment. If you could manipulate somehow, create barricades, repair houses and whatnot, then players will create their own goals (minecraft again). Societies could form, alliances could grow, bandits would finally have a reason to become bandits after all. Now, THAT's the kind of game I'm looking for! 

- Realism. For a game that boasts realism, either, or the fake buildings that you can't enter, or the unplayable dark nights unless you're super-equipped. It's all of it together. The absolute lack of interaction with anything, the weird game rules you have to accept blindly, and on and on... It screams ""GAME"" in my face and I cannot suspend my disbelief.

Simply put: The final score a game reviews will say more about how the reviewer thinks that game will be received by everybody else. It isn't a reflection of how they themselves think of it. In fact

In an industry where an AAA game must do harder to get panned than get good reviews, not merely pretty decent.

Whilst series do naturally get better over time, it'll get high reviews despite being a really unimpressive game by its own standards. In any other medium that'd be a 'haven't we done this before? think of some new ideas' scenario. Not in gaming, and I'm drawn back to the popularity factor as a reason for this.

The only contradiction I can think of exists with relatively unknown games: Indie and Mobile games. Here

We've been here so many times and I hate to bring this up again but it's such a big flaw that it's really hard to overlook. I do wonder if reviewers realise how bad they actually are at what they do. If you ask a random assortment of 10 people on the Internet how good a game is

Games are fun, the more you perceive it'll find a big audience and the better it ends up being reviewed in most cases (I stress most).

What do you think? Perhaps I'm being harsh but at the very least I think there's a genuine problem with the lack of personal opinion being shown in reviews.

By now, and will be more heavily moderated than r/gaming.  I'd like to use this opportunity to give you my thoughts on what this means for truegaming, and also to give the newer members a bit of an introduction.

First of all, which is why easy-to-digest content is upvoted a lot more.  truegaming was meant to be the place where those who wanted to talk about things were free to do so without being buried under shitty content.

Therefore, but word got around and here we are with almost 20k subscribers.  Downvotes hardly mean anything here.

The result of all this is that the community, and even in that case, because we move slowly, those no-hope threads still exist in new for long enough that the poster will get some replies.

In other words, the few among you who vote actually affect things.  I assumed that all threads made it to the front page on the strength of a couple of upvotes because we move slowly.  Not so.  Just check the new queue, there are a lot of posts that disappeared without a trace.  That's your handiwork, truegaming, and it only took around ten people saying ""No, this isn't what should be on the front page.""  10 out of 18,000.  Your vote counts.  The evidence is right there.

This works out for me, but I feel bad doing it.  All those comments you see, they're not made by a machine, but by a human being.  I don't like telling people they're not good enough to hang around.  The sidebar, well, I'm looking over it again and it seems a bit harsh.  Lord knows I'm not going to start banning people for minor transgressions.  But it sets the tone.

In other words, and those who believe rigid control works better for the community at large.  I consider myself further toward the former than most, because I have faith in people.  Once they stop acting how they feel they're supposed to act, and start being honest with themselves, people are generally all right.  Sure, they might be a little boring, but hey

I guess I could put it this way: truegaming isn't meant to be a supervised play area.  It's meant to be a place where human beings come to talk about games

I have seen people call truegaming 'stuffy'.  I wonder if there's some truth to that.  Not everything has to be an essay with references.  It's just... you know, but it should be with the intention of starting a discussion.  We don't function as a link aggregator the way Reddit normally does.

Greenlight will let developers promote their games in a public preview process, etc. and without having to go through Valve for approval.

Personally, not to mention crappy ISP that may or may not allow me to connect, makes it almost a dealbreaker if not for the sales and TF2.  Yes I know that there's an offline option, but it usually fesses up.


I'm also against locking games out to a single account. This is perhaps one of the reasons why I try to avoid buying digital and go physical instead. As a student, this is possible as the media itself could be passed around. Not on Steam. If I, say, wanted my friend to play my Steam copy of Portal 2, I'd have to give him my account details and would have to log-in to Steam. This effectively locks me out of my other games while he's playing it. True, he can log out afterwards but there might be an occasion wherein he'd be forced to re-login into my Steam account, forcing me out immediately. I like how the PS3 handles game sharing, that means he could run any and all of my downloaded games.


On another note, Australian prices are around $100 for a new game. However, they do have a somewhat higher standard of living and wages. Compare that to people like me living in a third-world nation, where a 40-hours-a-week job couldn't get you half a game due to the prices.

Even though modern games obviously paint a better picture of the world

I certainly get the impression that the fantasy worlds of older games were just more... fantastical. Can anyone provide any counter examples? Could this just be the result of gaming trending towards more realism? Or does anyone else think it's possible that older graphics simply left more to the imagination?

**Edit:** I've been criticized for failing to post an analysis of what makes my statement correct, specifically, is that having worse graphics, or even no graphics (see Dwarf Fortress) can induce the imagination to paint a deeper picture, or at least entice the use of more vibrant/engaging color schemes. In short, I'm arguing (since it seems I must) that while modern focus on graphics is the equivalent of modern photography, older games were more akin to paintings, especially AAA, the industry has shot itself in the foot by creating bland worlds that don't allow for the same fantastic immersion than the old ones did.

First of all, they don't work for Zelda. The main reason in my opinion is that it doesn't work well for long playing sessions (like laying down while playing), the controls aren't reliable for fast action (like trying to shoot the octopus in the eye and your cursor goes ape shit, or trying to charge your sword and you're pointing it up but Link is pointing to the side), and the game generally becomes more about performing the controls than solving a puzzle, exploring etc.

While brings me to my second point, dowsing more or less eliminates the need to explore, side quests are all very straight forward fetch quests that Fi tells you exactly how to solve or you dowse for what you're looking for. Zelda 1-3 for me had a very strong sense of isolation and exploration and that feeling is almost completely gone now. You are never alone with Fi or just game messages navigating and narrating almost everything you do.

Finally, etc., are not good. In my opinion, with video games, if the story isn't GOOD, it's bad. If it's not specifically awesome, it just detracts from the game and SS is full of totally mediocre characters. ""well asshole how do you suggest they make it better then huh?"" Answer - don't have them. There's no need. Instead of having some Goron explain to you what the Bird Statues are, more mysterious

Sorry that turned into a bit of a rant and I wanted to keep this civil for truegaming but I feel so frustrated with what Zelda is becoming compared to what it could be. I read some article today about how the Zelda producers are sticking with motion controls and couldn't go back to button controls

1360581470.0,18axz4,When can we expect self-sufficent (i.e. dynamic open) game worlds?,aoxo,356,90,275,"I have a bit of a rant written below

We've seen a lot of open world games in the last generation and we're constantly hearing about how players are given more choices and more freedoms - and with the advent of ""player driven"" gameplay we're seeing video games take on a much more unique style of story telling. Where one player may stick to the beaten path other players can go down a unique route and open up the game in a way that even the developers possibly didn't account for; but no matter how open a game is and no matter how many choices the player is given these games still end up being fairly restrictive in terms of what actually happens. 

Since they are almost the epitome of open world games I'll have to mention Skyrim and Fallout. While open world, but ultimately the game world doesn't react to player actions, much less react to its own events. One of the themes in Skyrim, the civil war, barely even begins to scratch at the inner workings of Skyrim as a story. In a world were towns should be fought over (and indeed are) very little actually changes the mechanics or experiences of the games. Regardless of who wins the war the world of Skyrim takes no notice. Playing through a number of times may net the player with different experiences, but ultimately the in-game universe remains as stale and static for the next player. Certain characters, quests

I don't want to imply that such games should be ever changing and procedurally generated, limited by static mechanics, but would also greatly improve from dynamic actions.

Freelancer is a prime example of a game which was static and could have been greatly improved by being more dynamic. Freelancer is a space sim, and small bases in the form of asteroids. Each and every one of these ""bases"" is owned be a faction, of which there are about 50. Each faction has set enemies and allies, belongs to a ""House"" (political sectors within the game world) and can be classified as either a government authority (i.e. police, military), corporation, or criminal organisation. What made this particularly interesting was that the player, you could find nuetrality, the ""Rheinland Military"" are enemies of a corporation called the Gas Mining Guild - trade with the GMG too much and they may begin to favour you, and from time to time you'd come across skirmishes that you could take part in if you felt obliged. What didn't exist is the influence of power of these factons. Freelancer had quite a bit of in-game lore about these 50 factions

STALKER on the other hand is a series where NPC's fight each other and can sometimes take over the little spots littered around maps. This wasn't so much a faction war, and it certainly has its dynamic moments, but it really doesn't have the infrastructure in place to change the game drastically from player to player. Much like in Skyrim with its static NPC's, experiences in STALKER and Freelancer end up being just as static because the game world never changes.

What I want to see in the future is a game world that is ever changing, corporations try and out do each other, economies crash, burn and strengthen. I want to enter a system one day and happily trade there, only to return the next day and see that it's under new management and yesterdays good are now worth putty. In STALKER I want to see a world where the NPC's own ""areas"" and can lose them - possibly even to the point that a whole map comes under the control of a new faction. I really want to see this happen without the player doing anything. Even players tend to make games just as ""static"" when they seek to find the ""best"" (most powerful, easiest, etc) way to do things. In games like TF2 you can server hop and find sentry guns in the exact same positions, or making the same tactical decisions despite the fact that there are 20 different players (or if you server hop enough potentially hundreds of players making the *exact* same decisions). I don't need to have 10 different coversation choices

My dream for the future of open world gaming is that I can enter a world that exists with or without me

",,477,218,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/11qpgw/final_fantasy_x_is_a_fantastically_welldeveloped/

I feel like the artistic repetition and somewhat ill-advised experimentation of later Final Fantasies (particularly a certain most recent one that I'm sure I don't have to name) can lead one to look back on the whole franchise as typifying decadent JRPG absurdity: incomprehensible battle systems and terminology, I can see where the critics come in.

But Final Fantasy X was perhaps so popular because it contextualised all the usual JRPG guff so well. Instead of the usual big bad - hopelessly evil villain who one can't relate to as a character (although I know the Final Fantasies have been good with characterisation, particularly in grounding the struggles of the protagonists in the villain itself. 

The battles do not feel as grindy. As a JRPG, except where other antagonist characters are involved. The battles are also, at least in the start, with considerably good use of pacing, not immediately overwhelming. They are introduced methodically, and many of the creatures have to do with the narrative.  

The party swap-out system likewise has the effect of increasing the strategic usefulness of all the characters, this game does it the most thoroughly through the use of swap-out device. All party members are relying on each other at all times. 

Summoning is also contextualised through the religious setting

Aside from the narrative itself being very strong, very internally consistent. And perhaps this is why today it holds up better than ever. Upon replaying it, despite the patchy English translation, I was impressed by the depth of its themes. 

I had originally defended FFXIII, you're saving the world, but so little of your actions feel as though they're aiding this process. You feel more as though you're being compelled towards the end, rather than enforcing a set of consistent skills. 

Of course, and give some deserved attention to what I believe is a near-perfect game.

When you ascend in Dark Souls, the world becomes more harsh and the environments more dark and desolate. Just compare New Londo Ruins to Anor Londo for the most direct indication of a really cool visual motif present throughout the entire game.

The first area after the tutorial (Firelink Shrine) is a microcosm of the visual motif of ascending/descending. The 3 possible routes (Undead Burg

As I mentioned originally

Undead Burg is both the easiest route and the path to the first bell (which

The Catacombs is the middling difficult path

New Londo Ruins is pitch black and damn near incomprehensible

So after you realize that going up is the only way that doesn't cream you its just a matter of climbing through Undead Burg and Undead Parish to the first bell. While the second bell does take you downwards to Blightown before you go upwards through Sen's Fortress

Then you go up through Sen's Fortress

After Anor Londo

Immediately after you speak with ~~Gwyndolyn~~ Gwynevere (happy now?) you are directed to Frampt, to show you where the Lord Vessel must be placed and that the Kiln of the First Flame is the narrative's new focal point.

A new conceit is established here

Every new area reinforces this new conceit. The Abyss is a plunge below New Londo Ruins, resembling Hell, a metaphor for how far down into Lordan you've traveled (and how grotesque it continues to get as you go lower).

While the Duke's Archives appears to be an exception to this rule it's actually the most clever example of this new progression. The Duke's Archives is the most obvious first choice of the four new routes you can take. Like the Undead Burg, and goes upward. So you start in the Archives whooping everybody on your way up the stairs to fight Seath. As anyone whose played knows, you can't win that fight, it's scripted to make you lose (the one exception in a game where every fight is beatable). Seath is teaching the player, he's saying ""You're not supposed to go up anymore stupid."" You respawn at the top at the Archives and must work your way back down through the Crystal Cave to actually beat Seath. Like Frampt, moving downward as a means of progression is reinforced through the gameplay, level design and aesthetics.

For me, while also opening my mind to new ways that games could draw players into a story. That experience was a show in New York City called ""Sleep No More"".

So what is ""Sleep No More?"" In short, sometimes in small groups, sometimes alone, by an elevator operator on various floors. They are given white masks that cover the entire face and instructed not to talk. In the words of the elevator operator as he pushed me out of the door, ""This is an experience to be had alone. Things are not always what they seem, and fortune favors the bold.""


Wandering off of the elevator, I heard soft music. Following it, the hallway opened into a huge hotel ballroom where 20 or so people were dancing an intricately choreographed waltz. A young waitress walked around passing out drinks and a pair of dancers began flirting with each other. But then, the lights cut out and the music turned dark. Suddenly the young waitress was in the center of the room, illuminated by a spot light. She begins an intense, writhing dance and before our eyes, rips out her hair to reveal that she is bald and transforms from an innocent servant girl into some sort of snake like monster. This is one of MacBeth's three witches.

This was one of the less strange things I saw last night. Other highlights include

* A woman eating raw human hearts only to then spit out a silver ring and give it to an audience member. She then began singing an old jazz song in a man's voice.
* Stumbling into a bedroom to find Lady MacBeth greeting MacBeth as he returns from battle and both of them naked
* Spending time in a detective's office, with a work bench in the back. He opens a drawer and inside is a dead bird which he begins dissecting with tweezers.
* Finding a graveyard and the ruins of a bombed out church with a man beating his head against a statue.
* Discovering the witch's hut, and then a bloody, dead baby was paraded around the room.

So, the total freedom to see things, while still giving enough subtle clues to get you to where the action is. And then, being able to see all of these non-linear pieces and letting them form the narrative for me. I'm still sure that I only got maybe 70% of the story, but it just makes me want to go again. The thing was like being in Bioshock's Rapture for the first time, but without the combat but the same amount of fear. I would love to see this experience replicated in a game - a fully detailed, open environment with a non-combat focused story and enough clues to let the player figure out what's going on without making it feel like they were led by the hand.

[and by the end of the game I had all of this money without much to do with it. I mean


In the first half of the game you can't just buy whatever you want because you'll go broke. But in the end it's just points. They serve no purpose and are there to look at. It gave me sort of an empty feeling. And then I remembered when i chose to kill the guy Niko was searching for the entire game. I mean, Niko kept saying how empty and unfulfilling the whole thing was. Like he felt the same - maybe worse after he finished the mission he ultimately came to the Liberty City for. But the journey of getting there he seemed to determined the whole time to find it. After all, he murdered countless people to get where he was; and I believe Niko is good at heart (oh man, that sounds ridiculous.)


I couldn't help but feel the same way about all the money I made and what I imagine a lot of ridiculously rich people feel too. It just comes down to points and it is ultimately empty. It's just a lack of content to buy and it will, in finally having it, give you true happiness.

I'm curious because having lived in Japan and Korea, and finally filling it with cringe-inducing Asian caricatures (which could be a whole discussion in itself).

What I consider to be good depictions:

**Secret World's Seoul**: while perhaps not the most accurate example, overall it at least feels like the developers tried to make it feel authentic. Now if only the character creator could making something vaguely representing an Asian character...

**Kane &amp; Lynch's Tokyo**: The game has its share of flaws, especially whatever upscale financial district the level is imitating, but the details sold it to me. As soon as the elevators opened and the police officer addressed you in real Japanese (and not some terrible butchered phonetic reading) I was grinning like an idiot. The little things really grabbed my attention and made it feel like Japan: the accurate police uniforms and cars, the businessmen in suits, the pedestrian overpass with the bike racks underneath, the vending machines, the convenience store storefronts

And some particularly egregious examples that come to mind:

**Dreamfall's Japan**: Sure it's the future, but it doesn't resemble a Japanese one at all), everyone spoke in British and American accents with random cringe-worthy butchered Japanese inserted (-san, gomen nasai).

**Chaos Theory's Seoul**: It just felt like a random NYC-style urban area with Korean-language signs everywhere. It's hard to pinpoint but the architecture felt very 'western' and didn't remind me of any area of Seoul that I've been to. And I've never seen random Chinese lanterns just strung up around the city in real life either (more Orientalism perhaps). I felt that the mappers were just making it up as they went along without any significant reference materials. The outrageous 'Asian' accents of the soldiers only made my frown deeper.

I think one of the mistakes people make with horror games is the idea that it should be unrelenting. That it should keep the tension the whole way through.

Fact of the matter is

Think about it. Think about Disney and Pixar films. They're not all happy all the time. In fact

The same applies to horror.

Keeping the atmosphere horrible and oppressive just desensitizes us from that atmosphere. We get used to it and it stops being scary after a while.

Let's take Amnesia. What many consider as the best survival horror of this generation. I will agree. It's great. It's scary. For a while.

Once you figure out that after every puzzle, it's not quite fear that drives you. Maybe you still experience a fight of flight mode boosted by adrenaline, but it's not quite *fear*. At worst, it's an irritates sigh that says, ""Let's just get this over with"".

Connected with that is the last one.

**Fear isn't rational**.

When I was a kid. I was afraid of the dark. But I wasn't stupid. I knew that monsters didn't exist. But I was afraid of them nonetheless.

People are afraid of spiders

Let's face it. We're afraid of stupid things for stupid reasons. But that's fear.

And yet

I'm not gonna say that a monster that you're afraid of because you know it can hurt you(or your character) doesn't invoke fear. It does. But it just doesn't evoke the same kind of fear IMO.

I'll admit

Why would I ever? It is always the most boring choice

Gaming slowly yet steadily works toward making good and evil equivalent choices. Situations where good vs evil is ""helping grannies vs eating babies"" are more rare. Also

But what about neutrality? Neutrality gets the ream. 

Alice wants to save the kittens

Or assume the game has some sort of a karma scale. Be evil, get good ending, get cool good perks. Be neutral, get nothing and lukewarm ending. Even if there are two ""separate scales"" for goodness and evilness, the proper choice isn't to be neutral, it's to be alternating between good and evil. That doesn't make you neutral, that makes you bipolar!

Now you can say rewards aren't important because I'm allowed to roleplay and should go with it, technically your character is weaker than it is supposed to be.

Now if you've done the choice you're not rewarded for (neutrality) your character is weaker than it is supposed to be. You are punished for neutral choices.

Neutrality is always the wrong choice.



What do you think

**EDIT: The comment section currently points at the Alpha Protocol, and the Witcher franchise. Shin Megami Tensei apparently makes the neutral path the hardest but gives you arguably the best ending if you follow through.**

Rather, and all that deviating from it in any significant way gets you is put back where you started?

In Uncharted, but that would make it impossible to continue on the clear path that the designers want you to be on, you've failed. Wouldn't it be interesting if that wasn't a failure state? If you were able to continue on from that fall? Or if Elena could die and this wouldn't just mean a restart of the gunfight?

I've thought for a while about how to do a Superman game the right way, I found basically the perfect fit, which I give to you now:

The next Superman game should have no failure states

Superman has limitations. Specifically, enemies won't be threats, they'll be obstacles, much like zombies are merely obstacles to be avoided in *Dead Rising*.

You're Superman. Your super hearing alerts you to a woman about to jump to her death (ala *All-Star Superman*). You can save her

In this game, and no game-over.

In one mission, you've failed, but the game continues. The failure means something, and the game plays out differently.

An example of where developers have made this work is the side mission with the Drell assassin Thane in *Mass Effect 2*. You're stalking a politician from the vents above, because you fucked up, but life goes on. As linear as *Mass Effect* really is as a series when you look at the nuts and bolts of it, this is a really good example of why Bioware shine as a developer.

For a couple more recent (and therefore spoiler tagged) examples of how developers can work around requiring failure states, in the ending [where you choose to live, you can choose to either hand your weapon over to the marine, or you can fight them.

Blizzard has always been a company that puts the quality of their games at the forefront. They are masters of making a fun experience and they have never released a game before it was ready in order to make a financial goal. It has always worked out for them because they were always able to grow

That trend stopped with WoW. WoW was an anomaly, and not in simply making a bunch of money. When a CEO consistently makes less money than the quarter before, that CEO is fired. It doesn't matter if they make 900 billion dollars one qarter and 899 billion the next. The total isn't the issue. The percentage growth is. Negative growth is negative share value, which in turn is unhappy share holders.

So Blizzard simply needs to make a spiritual successor to WoW.  What I mean by that is a subscription based game that has wide appeal. I think they can do it, and when they do, it will likely be 3-4 years before it's released (based on their track record of releases). 

None of this would be any big deal if they were privately owned, I believe Blizzard will have to change how they operate: putting more content out a hell of a lot faster, which is something that Blizzard has never done in order to preserve the quality of their games.**

In a recent conference call, and considering WoW subscribers will get a free copy of Diablo 3, the fact that WoW their bread and butter is even more certain.

1322176385.0,mobn9,Let's have a serious conversation about piracy.,Khiva,387,149,527,"There has been some chatter recently about UbiSoft's [response to piracy](http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/23/ghost-recon-online-being-free-to-play-is-a-counter-to-piracy-says-ubisoft-producer/).  The reaction on [gaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/mntv6/no_ghost_recon_future_soldier_for_pc_ubi_claims/) and [games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/mnue1/no_ghost_recon_future_soldier_for_pc_ubi_claims/)

Let me put my cards on the table first with an evidently unpopular opinion - piracy is a problem.  I have pirated games that I had no justification to pirate.  I wanted them

It's comforting to me to read that, insignificant minority.  Most people who pirate are apparently forced to do so because of draconian DRM, because they disagree with the corporate policy, because they have no legal means of obtaining the game, because they simply want to try the game out or because they were never going to buy the game anyways.

None of those applied to me.  Back when I didn't know how to torrent I bought games pretty regularly (secondhand or discounted, there was a period of several years when I bought barely any, certainly far less than I did before.  I fell into none of the above categories - I just wanted the games in the easiest, cheapest way possible.  It's nice to know I'm some kind of bizarre freak and that there are very few like me.

Except that's not true.  You know it and I know it.  The idea that vast numbers of people will not simply take the easiest

* Piracy is caused by restrictive DRM and the fact that developers have been neglecting the platform.  If they catered to the PC and removed the DRM then piracy rates would drop.

Counterpoint - The Witcher 2.  It's hard to imagine a game that catered to the PC more, much lower than other high-DRM titles which simply was not the case.  People torrented The Witcher 2 at rates which were just about what you'd expect for a title of its caliber.

Of course, that game came in with an established fanbase and the developer was confident of its quality.  The problem really comes in with marginal titles for which sales are not guaranteed, or where the cost/return margin gets to a point where catering to the platform no longer makes financial sense.  There's also, of course, the concern that making a product available on PC means that people will torrent it instead of buying it on the console.

* Piracy is just as prevalent on consoles.  Singling PCs out is unfair.

Sure there are torrents out there for console titles, but for the vast majority of people hearing the phrase ""hardware modification that runs the risk of ruining your console"" alone is enough to turn people away.  The risk and knowledge necessary to pirate on a console versus on the relatively open platform of the PC are not remotely comparable. 

You also have to believe that the people who run large companies are so stupid as to get this completely wrong.  If piracy rates really are the same on consoles as on PCs then every large company would have to

Furthermore, there simply might not be enough buyers left over after the pirates to make porting a game worthwhile.

* 1 pirate does equal 1 lost sale

This is obviously true, it doesn't matter how many pirates equate to lost sales, so long as there is an overall negative effect on the bottom line.  

And let's face it - there has got to be.  It's hard to think of a single large

Taken together

* The largest and most successful companies are run by people who have no idea how to make money and have little to no clue about market size

* Companies should do absolutely nothing about the piracy of their products.

* Everything is the fault of everyone _but_ the people who are getting games for free.

The fact that otherwise reasonable people have been backed into arguing these positions should alone be enough to give a person pause.  The collective refusal of the PC gaming community to place _any_  blame on pirates rather reminds of the Republican refusal to accept any sort of tax increase on anything ever - something which sensible people on the outside find astonishing but for people on the inside is a tightly clung-to article of faith.

Personally, but I'm just as annoyed with the people who pirate the game as with the company that responds to it.  It's hard to blame a company for going where the cash is because that's simply what companies do.  But for people who can afford machines that cost 2 to 3 to 4 to 5 times what a console does complaining that they can't afford to play games   ....you can do better than that.  And as a community, we can do better than gnashing our teeth like spoiled children at every bit of bad news and complaining that the fault is, once again, with absolutely everyone but ourselves.

Second, and other discussions along this line. Don't let the discussion dissolve into bitching about any non-gaming issues simply for the sake of bitching. If you want to talk about copyright as a whole, go to /r/copyright. 

Thirdly

It seems a bit strange that we apply the same copyright to videogames that we apply to literature and music. Think about it; copyright's original intention, which incentivizes creation. So, while it does allow for a creator to profit from his work for a period of time, that isn't what it is there for.""

*I had originally stated that copyright's was originally intended to ""let the creator of a work profit from said work

Today, ninety-five years. This is *more* then enough time for a creator to profit from a work. While over seventy years is a *long* time to wait for a work to be released into the public domain, it isn't entirely unreasonable; acclaimed works such as *1984* will be released to the public domain in 2020, and readers may still be able to take away a powerful experience. 

Now, with games, twenty years is a *colossal* interval of time. 

To prove this, the quality of the experience they provide to gamers today. Believe it or not, but it seems like most people would *probably* choose to play Dishonored over Doom. Most people are *probably* going to state that if Doom was first released in 2012, it wouldn't be as fun to play as Dishonored! 

**The fact of the matter is that currently, which can provide powerful experiences to readers decades after such works are released.** 

**Despite this, if both forms of entertainment have the same lifespan to sell copies.** 

This sort of copyright law restricts ""antique"" games from being legally released to the public domain. Developers/producers can release these ""dead"" games to the public domain whenever they damn well please. Before they choose to do so, which reduces the platforms ""dead"" games can be released upon. 

Yes, developers could still earn a profit from a 20 year-old game, and gamer can still have a powerful experience. However, the disparity between a game released in 1993 vs. a game released in 2012 are *gigantic*. Retaining a copyright on *Pokemon Red* is *not* the same as retaining the copyright for *A Game of Thrones; A Song of Ice and Fire*, despite both being released in 1996. Take a quick guess at how many copies Pokemon Red has sold in 2012 in comparison to *A Game of Thrones*. Take a quick guess at how much money Nintendo would have lost *from sales of Pokemon Red* if the game was released into the public domain. 

I'm not saying that the *characters* of a game have a short lifespan. Hell, and he's probably going to be doing so for years to come. However, Super Mario Brother for the NES still hasn't be released to the public domain, despite being released *28 years ago*. What is the justification for Nintendo still holding the copyright to Super Mario Bros (NES)? How does this copyright ""protect"" Nintendo's sales of the game, while allowing it to be released into the public domain?

**Tl;dr and conclusion;** It seems that the length of time for a game's copyright to expire is far too long. Gaming changes and vidoegames ""die"" far more quickly than works in other forms of entertainment

Those are but two examples of MANY in Skyrim that illustrate a serious problem: what good is the ability to do anything in the world, it's a matter of ""Do I take the Black Star instead of Azura's Star so I don't have to hunt down Black Soul Gems?""

Choice and consequence in TES are damn near non-existent now, as I'm holding off on that one for now. In general, though, choice and consequence is damn near non-existent. The typical choice is ""Do you accept this mission? Y/N"" and the typical consequence is ""You receive [item]"". By mostly sticking to this, the rich possibilities of the world of TES are cheapened.

1345038815.0,y9ek3,My first impressions of Counter Strike: Global Offensive,blu2th,329,95,218,"Any time I've stopped playing something for a long period of time, sometimes a week or so or some booze to get me to a place where I'm going to be happy recording some new memories. This isn't a reflection of how good the game is either

That said when Counter Strike: Global Offensive was announced, and after a few months of reading a few blog posts and threads from people who had made it into the closed beta my interest began to perk up. The main reason for this was the sheer volume of complaints beta tester were making about the game. It was fascinating watching the development process play out in such an open environment but without having any knowledge of the product beyond eye witness accounts. It resulted in the only possible reaction. As my hungry eyes flew over countless bleating posts about recoil balance issues, my head was desperately shouting: “We have got to try this!”

My first memory of CS:GO will always be that I jumped onto a server as soon as it had installed, but I'm not sure that will attach itself to the rest of the memory. I already knew it was an achievement and I didn't need the game to tell me that, but all the same we're used to our games keeping a record of how awesome we are these days.

So what do I think of it? I think I like it. It has shapes and sounds I recognise that make me comfortable but there are still enough new bits to keep this from looking like a HD Texture pack. It has avoided the majority of modern day shooter trends to keep itself individual. I was elated when I discovered clicking my right mouse button didn't bring the AK47 and kickstart my magnify eyes. I was equally happy to get shot over and over again, and they aren't afraid of ignoring what most consider to be industry standards. I like this. It keeps the pace frantic because no one's staring down the iron sights of their sidearm whilst hiding behind a box. Instead they're running around, clearing rooms and checking corners and letting the action play out in rapid fire fights when the enemy is found. The closest thing to stealth is walking or crouching, and the latter will only be done for accuracy. This is Counter Strike, and these are the things I feared for when the game was first announced. 
What Valve had included has been well executed. There's a quick join option which cuts out the need for the server browser. You tell it what kind of game you're looking for and it finds it for you. A few items below that in the menu is the server browser. No one has been spurned here, friendly fire is off by default and everyone starts with body armour. On the Counter Terrorist side, everyone gets a defusal kit. Competitive mode sees a return to traditional Counter Strike values in terms of team attacking, earning extra protection and being more challenging for those players who want it that way. 
It's difficult to see who hasn't been catered for here. There are obvious touches included for the console releases but there are still all of the PC counterparts we've come to expect and you don't need to route around anywhere to find them.
With regards to gameplay: it's Source. Anyone who's played a lot of CS:S is going to find it easier slipping in to this. It's not a comfy old slipper you've worn around the house for a few years

Something about Nintendo's announcement of Super Mario 3D World bothered me

The summer of 1998 was when I first got into console gaming. I was 11 at the time, Super Mario 64 and Donkey Kong 64 were the games that turned me into a ""gamer."" For 15 years my first and favorite genre has been the 3D platformer.

""3D platformer"" is a bit of an odd genre. Neither word in that name actually addresses what makes it unique. The skill of timing your running, 3D platformers require those skills to complete missions: Defeat King Bob-omb, free Clanker the shark, get to the top of the lighthouse. Each successful completion of a mission awards the player with one of the many MacGuffins required to beat the game. Other MacGuffins can be collected, and certain 3D platformers leaned heavier on this collection aspect than others.

It could be argued that what made 3D platformers unique was a result of decisions Nintendo made with Super Mario 64, but at least Nintendo is still making them."" I can no longer say that.

Normally I might look to the indie scene for hope, but 3D games are much more time and resource consuming. 3D indie games certainly exist, but they aren't nearly as common, and I don't see any way their development could get much easier-- adding another dimension just makes things more complicated, even if you have the resources and time.

Even if they were easy to make, I'm just not hearing much buzz in the community about new mission-based, 3D platformers on the horizon, beyond things like Rare alumni talking about making a Kickstarter for a ""Banjo-esque"" game, or trying to buy back the Conker rights from Microsoft. I'm seeing a lot of talk, a lot of pipe dreams, but not a lot of action.

Is this genre dead in the water? Are its fans too few and far between to worth noting? I'm a firm believer in the idea that no genre in this industry is dead forever, others failed, and the industry moved on. 

I'd hate to see my favorite genre delegated to a footnote.

FPS was king; Quake, Unreal, and Tribes were the main games people played (some people still played Doom, but not many). Movement in these games was fast, fluid, and unintended exploits such as bunnyhopping and skiing made them even faster.

While some of this is still present today, is not a movement-based FPS, and encourages cover, unlike Quake, which emphasizes moving fast as hell at all times).

Even so called ""old-school"" modern games don't really compare. Tribes: Ascend is slower, unlike its previous counterparts. UT3 was slow compared to UT2004, which was still more sluggish than UT99.

My interpretation of the different races is that they are simply different subsets of the Human race's traits and that is what makes it possible for us to bond with them even though we really do not get to know them very well.

What I mean by that is that the different races seem to be one or two different Human expressions taken to an extreme and made the focal point of the race and this is what makes them relatable. So:

1. The Krogan race are Human Rage and Lust personified
2. The Salarians are Scientific inquiry and Curiosity
3. The Hanar are Religion and Obedience
4. The Asari are Compassion and Empathy
5. The Elcor are Afterthought and Carefulness
6. The Volus are Greed and Powerlust
7. The Turians are Discipline and Military might
8. The Quarians are Wanderlust and Exploration
9. The Geth are Technology and Unity
10. The Drell are Industry and Progress

This is also quite interesting if you look at the ""enemy"" races in the game. 

[1. The Rachni are a hive intelligence and as a Human that is not something we can relate to in the same way as we are all individuals.](/spoiler) 

[2. The Reapers are a machine intelligence which while similar to the ""frenemy"" race Geth is still very different in my mind as they want to exterminate all life.](/spoiler) 

[3. The Geth are a newer machine intelligence and still retain some Human (Quarian/biological) semblance in both their logic and ways. They are not out to kill all sentient life in the galaxy

[4. The Collectors also seems unrelatable but that might be because they are introduced as bad guys the first time you hear about them. Otherwise they might be seen as Self improvement personified.](/spoiler)

[5. The Batarians are in my opinion Pride and Anarchy personified. I believe this is so due to the fact that their Pride makes them withdraw from ""Civilized"" society and head out into the barbarian lands where there is no rule of law. A single blow to their ego is enough for them to abandon all diplomacy and go on the warpath. ](/spoiler)

[6. The Vorcha are in my opinion our Survival instinct and Perseverance. If you take into consideration that they live where others cannot live, and when cornered they will lash out like a trapped animal](/spoiler)

Now I don't claim that this is the be all end all of the races and it would be interesting to me to find out what you think about this theory. Is there anything to it or is it simply my Human brain trying to find a pattern that isn't there?

I'm going to try to keep this an objective comparison on game mechanics and overall theme. I'm going to avoid the topics of customer service

**Diablo 2: The Golden Standard**

When Blizzard released Diablo 2

I found the gothic elements of the game to be the drawing feature. The player is thrown into a macabre world

The character feels almost naked at the start, but it feels like the NPCs are sending you on a suicide mission to kill Blood Raven.

The items maintain realistic aesthetics up to the higher levels; there are no embellished breastplates and very few colorful weapons. You feel like a small hero in a huge world

The player makes up for this vulnerability by advancing through the skill tree. Choices must be made wisely, there are many like it, but this one is mine.

**Diablo 3: Gothic meets World of Warcraft**

When Diablo 3 came along a decade later, for God's sake!

To me, and Gothic was becoming Hot Topic. 

The characters in Diablo 3 start off powerful. Their armor is stylized, our character just as effortlessly slaughters the enemy.

It is only exaggerated from there. Armor becomes more detailed and elaborate. Weapons glow with power. Shoulders become more spikey and eventually glow themselves. The character's skills become increasingly powerful. The Diablo 2 heroes wouldn't stand a chance against this lot of prismatic protagonists.

The only way to keep the escalation of arms equal is to create more powerful monsters. Starting in nightmare mode, and one demon a slightly different color than the other dozen killed me in a few seconds? It felt cheap.

My whole character felt cheap. They gave me free reign of all the abilities my class could have. Unfortunately

**Path of Exile: bringing Gothic back**

Path of exile became available with little fanfare. I found out about it not from a press release or a web banner, it's *really* like Diablo 2!"" 

The second I created my character, and grabs a driftwood club for a weapon. He fights for his life against the bloated, resurrected bodies of his former shipmates. As he fights his way to safety, he picks up scraps of armor to wear, a shield make of old ship planks, and a salt rusted helmet. The first boss made me say, ""Oh shit!"" as the giant pulled a sword from his own gut and started hacking away at my character.

The theme stays true late into the game. Eventually, is it a sight for sore eyes when it drops. Even when worn, it doesn't transform the character into a demigod or fashion diva. 

The game mechanics keep a good pace. The monsters always hurt you. As a melee class

The massive skill tree truly made my character my own. It was overwhelming at first, and what path I would have to take to get them. The massive amount of choices results in some unique builds. I've never seen a Witch build like mine.

All in all, however. Their particular skill sets meet my play style, and I feel invested in them and their story.

tend to be total game-changers for you?",68,349,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10xzy2/lets_reverse_it_what_are_some_great_qualities/,"Yesterday we [critiqued](http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/10vh23/there_are_certain_flaws_that_many_of_us_can/) games and took them to task for their dealbreakers. Now, let's flip things for the positive and talk about those qualities in games that are powerful enough to make you reconsider your feelings towards a game or that are disproportionately *great* for you to experience.

Some of mine:

* **Fun Beyond Winning** 

I brought this up in a thread yesterday, I still loved the experience I had.

In Killing Floor, I don't mind because I legitimately enjoyed what I was doing for the duration of the match, and that *isn't* spoiled by a failed outcome.

Whenever the mechanics of a game are engaging/rewarding/fulfilling for the player

*Other examples: Mario Party

* **That Curious Intersection of Narrative and Mechanics** 

Driver: San Francisco wasn't a great driving game. The physics were kind of wonky

But Driver: San Francisco was a *great game* because of how it tied its storyline into the gameplay. Centering the narrative around the main character's ability to possess other drivers and change cars at will seems like a straight-up gimmick, and the other half was watching it play out *better* than my expectations predicted.

Analogue: A Hate Story tells a story by having you interact with a computer AI to get logs from a spaceship. It makes sense to think of the content of those logs as the main narrative

Too often in games we think of story and gameplay as separate (just think of the gameplay-cutscene-gameplay-cutscene cadence we see so often), to the benefit of the medium. We're getting lots of really compelling, really creative experiences that wouldn't be possible in any other format, and that's *awesome*.

*Other examples: The Stanley Parable

* **Diverse Characters**

The writing for Fallout: New Vegas and Borderlands 2 both took big steps up in my mind when I encountered queer characters that were given the same authorial treatment in the plot as any others. They weren't reduced to a single dimension, without spoilers, offers some pretty powerful humanization to its characters that's centered around traits and experiences we don't normally encounter in gaming.

The more games we see where the characters are *meaningful* and not just *functional*, but I feel like the *motion* of the medium is headed in a positive direction. We're now at a place where we can think critically about the depictions and conventions that we're used to, and we're also at a place where the people making games are choosing to broaden the spread of narratives to encompass the stories and people who often go underrepresented and overlooked.

*Other examples: The Blackwell Series

1333710483.0,rw4jw,Why is reddit so protective of the F2P model?,nothis,405,179,521,"Notch recently called F2P a scam on twitter. The post [on /r/games](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/rvi31/notch_f2p_is_a_scam/) immediately swallowed downvotes (even though the net voting seems to be more ""controversial"" than negative) but also 100+ comments

I'm always baffled by how protective reddit is of F2P. I've written countless posts about why I think F2P is a bad model and even TF2 doing it wrong. I actually even get upvotes, dare I say, my reasons to think so are so blatantly obvious that even the biggest supporters of F2P have to acknowledge them. But the overall vibe seems to be that F2P is great or at least when it's ""done right"". As if ""competitiveness""/balance is all that matters and spending 100 hours in-game is anywhere near getting things for ""free"". ""Pay-to-win"" is just the tip of the iceberg and easily avoidable by clever companies, I'm talking about ""pay-to-have-fun""/""pay-to-avoid-grinding"".

I'll just lazily copy my most recent rant about it:

&gt;I've never seen it done right. Never. I was at first excited when the trend started (It's ""free*""

&gt;Here's what I could accept: Give me the option to pay a normal full price and have me unlock everything that way. Basically, you get an extended demo and can invest as much as you want to get advanced content. But it's never like that. It's not a linear scale towards the traditional cost of a game. Not even considering ongoing developer support. It's downright strange how consistently that's the case.

&gt;You always get 80% of a game for free and the last 20% is priced at somewhere beyond $500 split up in lots of tiny microtransactions. Or literally infinite cost for making things faster

&gt;Freemium is a full-commitment game design decision. You can't slap it onto any genre without turning it into a ""freemium version"" of it, I'd take any EA/Activision launch-day DLC over it. 

In short:

F2P adds grinding and waiting to games in order to sell you the ability to skip the grinding and waiting for an inappropriate fee. It doesn't ""replace"" traditional purchases because in its ""micro""-transactions there is more cost hidden than any full-price cost of non-F2P games. And they're mostly designed to never feel ""complete"".

You don't even have to go [full Tapfish](http://kotaku.com/the-daily-show/)

I'm worried about the future of multiplayer games and, it makes ""consolization"" and DLC-milking look tame in comparison. Why is no one up in arms about it?

The start of it in the train station was awesome
The fight against striders (especially at the end of ep 2) were all huge and very rewarding once finished.

I have some ideas why i founded it as immersive. The fact that you never leave gordon freeman's view certainly is a big part of it. You never have to go to menus (exept maybe at the very start to bind keys such) or watch cut scenes.

The scale is another reason. Everything feel big as opposed to many games where nothing seems really imposing. I don't know why it feels this way and it may be only me but even in the last CoD the New York part didn't seem that imposing to me. This makes the fight against the Striders much more impressive

A bit related to the previous point is that everything in the game isn't completely ""compressed"". What i mean is that not everywhere you are in the game contain ennemies

Now couple that with the...

* Pretty huge gameplay

* Fucking ROLE PLAYING! Lvling up and getting lost in statistics about character customization are not ""role playing"". Actually *having a conversation* and having your decisions affect the story and the other characters in the game

* Non-linear story telling! So there's a boss fight at some point. You might kill them and they're gone, regarding Paul Denton: [Does he have to die at the 'Ton hotel? I tried to go gung-ho all guns blazing out the front door with him but it was hard with all the stealth stuff I was using. I'll probably revist that after the game ends.](/spoiler) Also, after that, [I get captured and taken to the MJ12 facility (where I first hear Daedalus in my head).](/spoiler) The moment I [step out the main door and](/spoiler) realize I where I am, I just paused in amazement! Very powerful moment with a very smart buildup, like puzzle pieces falling in place all at once giving you an epiphany.  



* Cyberpunk theme. This one is purely subjective and a matter of personal taste, cyborgs, robots, AI, nanotechnology, transhumanism, conspiracy theories, It's hard to go wrong with such a premisse.

* And to seal the deal: Completely captivating soundtrack. (I got the game from gog where they give you the complete soundtrack along with the game and I've been listening to it a lot :D )


Minor nit-picky

* I can buy stuff from a bunch of vendors. I can't sell any of my stuff. :( meh..

* I would prefer seperate keys for action and holstering a weapon/item. ""Gothic"" (and maybe some others that I don't recall) did this right! This way

The Billy Murray theory is looking at the design of game worlds and the player's experience within them. Billy Murray comes into the equation if you compare games to two of his movies: *Groundhog Day* and *Scrooged*.

Game worlds designed like *Groundhog Day* can be summed up like this: The player, allowing him to learn and bend the ""rules"" of the world to better himself. He is able to explore, discover, experiment, fail, and grow as he tests the limitations of what he can do. At the end of the movie, when he ""beats the level"" and moves on to the next day

Now lets look at games designed like *Scrooged*. In Scrooged, or rather, declares his change. Its artificial, a response to what he witnessed, rather than a genuine change as a result of self-improvement.

Some examples from the lecture of relate-able video games where games like Megaman and Metroid. Classic games tended to have *Groundhog Day* designs, and Alan Wake, which self-narrates the answers to puzzles the player is trying to solve.

1:1 scaling of distance

If you can identify someone in real life by their face from 150' away and your monitor has a high enough resolution. You should be able to do the same in-game @150' at a matching RL and Game FOV. If your screen was large enough to cover your entire visual cone (170°H x 140°V) you would essentially be on the beta Holodeck of the starship Enterprise. The virtual world would completely overlay your perception. This isn't REALLY possible with the sort of resolutions and head tracking accuracy available today but a taste of that Virtual world is possible with even a single big screen TV or cheap 720P Projector or even just a Decent Triple-head.

When people spout the term ""immersion"" it usually pertains to a game's story lines or the atmosphere of a map.

**EDIT - I would just like to add that [this ""FOV in games"" video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blZUao2jTGA&amp;hd=1) is the standard response to any topic and I agree with 99% of what this man says.. Everything EXCEPT the part where he says PC gamers have a 30"" screens two feet from their face.. Which works out to be EXACTLY 55.8° of real horizontal view obstruction by the screen in-case anyone wants to do some math. A 52"" screen ten feet away calculates to 21.3° of horizontal vision obstruction. So using 90 instead of 55 and 60 instead of 21 is still very wrong.**",,t5_2sgq6,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/mnqux/lets_talk_about_lowering_our_fovs_for_once/

YOU ARE one of the countless soldiers that went into Boletaria seeking something, like Blue. You're never gone, unless you choose to leave. You can try as many times as you want, but like Blue (he even talks about how he tried a number of times to save the lands and re-obtain his body, and become unbound from the Nexus) most people give up. This is well symbolized when Blue disappears from the Nexus and leaves behind his soul. Blue is the people who gave up on Demon's Souls, YOU are the hero that is supposed to press on and save everyone (for differing personal motivations, maybe you want power

Either way, and I mean you the one who's reading this and probably thinks I'm up my own ass (I am).

That's the beauty of the deepness of DS

Furthermore

And then I realized how Demon's Souls turns you into a monster

By the time I had finished my second playthrough I was a jaded dick, and destroying Boletaria over and over.

And that's the point, and as such my rage and frustration turned me into a horrible person.

When the Old One said to me ""BRING MORE SOULS"", I just did it so he would give me new spells.

And that's the sorrow of it all. The Nexus has essentially bound me forever

TL;DR: Demon's Souls turns you into a monster, your just another blue phantom fading away.

1316449851.0,kklqi,Why have cheats disappeared from gaming?,blitzburgher92,251,36,143,"As someone who is 20 years old, Goldeneye, get infinite gold

Yet, I can think of a few reasons why (next paragraph), but I would like to see how a couple other people view this, especially from the eyes of people who are older than me and have a longer experience with gaming.

The main causes that initially come to MY mind are the inclusion of achievements, games have evolved from simply entertainment to a fix for the completionist inside all of us.  There were definitely bragging rights to be had for beating Super Mario on the NES, but now, with online gaming and ""gamerscore"", we have a quantitative way to measure those achievements, and thus, a number which has a slight correlation to our skill and experience with gaming.  Now that we have achievements, we would rather get them through certain tasks

Also, but rather cheating the coding, and reinventing it for our needs.  I have a copy of Fallout 3, and was able to find a mod that retextured the entire wasteland to make it look as if the world had recently been nuked, and the storefronts still had bright paint.  Now, I feel like the codes are transferred into our hands, and we possess the responsibility to shape what we ""unlock"".

Finally, and work put into style rather than making an adrenaline roller coaster i.e. Call of Duty campaigns, it wanted to define itself as entertainment that could be taken seriously.  Since more games seem to be leaning in that direction these days, how would we be able to put in modes with giant pucks, low gravity, or infinite ammo, without seemingly taking away the weight of the artistic merit?

So, but I personally think this is a serious, deep discussion worthy of truegaming.

Edit:  Thanks Zorba for bringing a fresh philosophy to the table!  It really helps to have someone from the other end of the production cycle to let us know how it works today.

Specifically this: There is a constant pressure on everyone from consumers, to retailers, to distributors, and finally the media.  We *must* hype a game, to make it seem like it's going to change gaming.

And I *hate* this.

Don't get me wrong--games can have hype.  I mean

That's the pressure consumers put on developers.  It's something I find frightening as a burgeoning developer.  What if I'm successful?  What if my fans would ever want a sequel?  I then have to *deliver*.  And you might say

I think Blizzard must feel this with Diablo 3.  It's a game with a lot intentional choices to separate it from its predecessor, and initially well received for these changes.  Now it's popularly considered a cock-up in a lot of ways because it's not enough like its predecessors--I think that's a pretty disheartening predicament.

It's a vicious circle in a lot of ways.  Games are sold and hyped based upon them trying to be a ""definitive"" experience that is unlike anything before--despite the vast majority being sequels that have strong ties to games that come before.

Saying we have ""more of the same

See what I'm saying?  Exaggeration like that isn't uncommon--notwithstanding the fact that it's practically insulting to our intelligence.

We love to lap up the hype built up around a game--especially in a franchise we love or from a Naughty Dog-level studio.  I think this is a good example of how fans are also extremely passionate.  Fans will defend a game despite its flaws.

That being said, is a franchise that creates a solid experience every year.  Call of Duty, especially numbers 2 and 4 were blasted with some outrageous reviews and hype.  The series actually did transform the gaming scene in a lot of ways.  Each subsequent game has really not varied the formula too much; but that formula still exists and yet was once viewed as an extremely fun and even well done experience is often tossed out as shit.  See all CoD detractors.

As I said above, hype begins.  Inevitable sequel with absurd amount of hype.  Sequel billed as revolutionary or something it just isn't, some fans become detractors--fatigue begins.

It's a catch-22 of sorts in that if a good game comes out, but this exponentially grows with each passing day it seems.

Couple this with the inherent passion so many in the industry carry and we get huge exaggerations.  See the recently leaked Last of Us review where the game is heralded as the ""Citizen Kane of gaming.""  Holy *fuck*.

What fundamentally separates video games as a medium from book or movies is the interactivity - YOU are experiencing the medium, the protagonist gains characterization without sacrificing immersion.

There are plenty of games where this has worked obviously.  Bioshock is one where your character becomes strongly determined by both your actions and your character's existing background without protagonist dialogue.  The Half-Life series is the shining example

We can apply it to less likely games as well.  For example Pokemon RBY/GSC.  At the end of the Elite 4

I spent four hours playing before I realized what happened.  It didn't make sense - the controls are clunky, how could this outdated game be hooking me?  Or does it make sense that I'm getting hooked?

What about Morrowind had me hooked for so many hours when I can't tolerate a game like Skyrim for longer than a couple at a time?  Obviously, has a nice map system, places things on the map for you, has a compass, etc.  But wait a minute.  Maybe the convenience of Skyrim IS it's downfall.

There was one part that really stuck out to me in Morrowind.  I had to talk to Bacola Closcius to find out where Caius is living.  He told me to exit the building

Whoa.  What?  No minimap icons?  No meta game guidance?  What an experience!  I had to leave the building, and head down the road.  That right there was part of the hook.  Each step of the game is an actual experience.  I was forced to actually read the instructions and make sense of them - not just follow some stupid arrow.

I ask because I had an idea that probably wouldn't work, and was also neutral(well, can sell their services, I mean) as far as factions are concerned.  For example: The Snoodle race is a race born with great healing powers, but cannot use offensive magics and can't fight. You would force each faction to have to recruit healers in-game. It would be cool for the healers because they would need to be wooed via gear since they can't kill anything to get any themselves. Since they're essentially healer mercenaries, they can switch sides if there's a better offer. Maybe a system where when you join a raid group or dungeon group you ""align"" yourself with that group until it disbands or if you like them you can join their guild. There's a lot of ways it could go and could be fun, but it may be one of those things that's fun in theory only.

I'm late to whole Metroid series. I had played through Hunters a few years ago on the DS but that was it. It'd never played one of the ""proper"" games. I got Metroid Prime Trilogy for the Wii some time back but only started playing it a few weeks/months ago. I started up Metroid Prime and selected the ""normal"" difficultly. I didn't know this at the time but the ""normal"" difficulty did not actually exist on the original release of the game and is a special easy mode added for the Wii version

As you might guess from the title of this post I managed to complete the game without dying. I came close a few times but with some effort (and gallons of health) I managed to beat the game in one continuous unbroken stream. So naturally a week later I started up Metroid Prime 2. I had learned about the thing with the difficulty settings and also I had found Metroid Prime 1 too easy; I wasn't just not dying I wasn't even having to exert any effort to survive for most of the game. Because of those reasons I chose the Veteran difficulty this time.

It was pretty apparent right away that this was going to be much tougher, I've not put off playing the game entirely, but I do want to give it a rest for the moment. It was just too much of a blow to me.

And it's just really interesting. I've almost never had that sort of reaction to a fail-state in a game. Death is just something you take for granted and if you get used to it you really lose the fear and impact of it and the funny thing narrative-oriented action games are really the big thing. It's what most AAA are and they're almost always balanced around the player dying many times as they progress and learn even though it completely breaks the narrative and breaks the tension.

I can't think of any other game that I've played where my first reaction is to just try something instead of looking for the right thing to do. It's refreshing to just be given a space to explore with minimal hand holding.

Also the menu room is a really nice touch. From a technical stand point menu selections are no different from throwing in-game switchs (it's all just adjusting variables) so it's nice to see the menu in-game. 

All in all it appears to really break down what a game actually is and what it could be. Space manipulation is one area where games have a distinct advantage over media and yet it seems to be so under-utilised as a tool.

Still with me? Okay great. So, I thought myself, since this way they don't have to spend too much time programming all the possible permutations of the first game's outcomes. Not smooth in any way, but something I could live with as long the story would still be tight and the new characters likable. During the game, a lot of work was put into character development, as most of the game's content was in the loyalty missions. You spend the game getting to know your crew, and getting them to trust you as you command them towards a near certain death. At the end of the game you have fought improbable odds and survived

Despite ""Chronicles"" being generally regarded as one of the worst in the series, I was SO freaking excited for this game... and then I actually played it. I don't think I need explain my level of disappointment, but suffice to say I put it down after the first hour of intolerable play.

Over the years I would pick it up again every now and then, the taste was simply too horrible to bear. And then came college, and the release of the much higher-quality new trilogy. I quickly beat all three on my housemate's PS2 (I left mine at home, just bringing my games so we didn't need to have more than one of the same console in the house), and he being a ""Raider"" fan as well followed. But just as he was in the middle of ""Anniversary,"" I decided to try ""Angel of Darkness"" one more time, as it was at the time the only game in the series I had yet to beat.

You could tell that it was still trying to draw the figures, but the colors and shapes were like something out of an epileptic nightmare.

We tried other games and they were all the same- even the console start-up menu had gone Jackson Pollock on us. There was nothing we could do- the PS2 had gone full retard.

I apologized profusely, and losing it to an unholy abomination of a game wasn't easy. So, upon getting home to my own console, I decided once and for all to rid myself of this game.

The history of this game is interesting.  To compliment the original [planned reboot](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=5&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CFAQtwIwBA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMHGvNW4fhhI&amp;ei=KurvUPyBHYel0AWYsoGIDQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNH0NSi2XYoI0Oh_I-VTyFr5JoTnnw&amp;sig2=5kHbwe7gamkqDv59s6xc6w), downloadable Turn Based strategy game to compliment it - you know for the small audience that missed the original, as everyone wants FPS's nowadays.  

Then E3 2010 happened.  

The FPS debuted and everyone said ""this isn't X-COM"", priorities switched.  [XCOM is currently being rebuilt as a third person squad shooter a la Gears of War](http://www.gamesradar.com/xcom-fps-may-become-third-person-squad-shooter/), a small and downloadable one at that, while the Firaxis strategy game was being retooled for a full AAA release.  AND IT EXPLODED.

They added something very interesting (though I'm not sure if this was planned the whole time)

The question is

It's sort of old hat.  An inexplicably diverse group of extraterrestrials invade the earth and start abducting people.  The XCOM project launches to save the day, you hire soldiers, capture enemies, dissect and interrogate them and adapt their technology in order to save the human race.

But is that what happens?

Well yes, ""at what cost?""  Again, this is quite a common trope in science fiction.  Then again, [look at what Dr. Vahlen's interrogations look like](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=117664183).  What are the aliens doing the whole time?  They're abducting humans, and testing them.  At one point though, they switch tactics.  [They begin testing XCOM by forcing combat situations.  Eventually XCOM begins testing its own soldiers for Psychic potential.  You find a few.  You then give one of them extra powers (the volunteer),](/spoiler) which leads to the final mission.

The first line?

[""You have succeeded where we have failed.](/spoiler)

Now, but also anti-war on terror a bit.  In this version, the XCOM aliens are definitely terrorists pushing an ideology.  An ideology which, by the end of the game [you adopt - abduction, interrogation, adaptation](/spoiler).  Of course, you get a heroes' ending.  Everything is cool. 

""But at what cost?""

Honestly though

Let's play videos are not solely the realm of intellectual property rights as a lot of the content is often provided by the author of the video

As I understand it

Let's plays have become very popular now meaning it is harder for companies to cast a blind eye

It is unfortunate that the people who make the let's play videos will not be making money, arguably outdated laws, making all your income from let's plays is perhaps not the soundest idea. Since people are already getting their full income from let's play videos though I realise making them lose their income is a bad idea, especially as they're advertising for Nintendo. Nintendo can't actually be advocating the people behind the let's play videos though as then they would need to agree to not say things which Nintendo will be blamed for.

I don't know if this is the best approach for Nintendo to take but I do think that they're not entirely in the wrong. I think they are losing customers due to let's plays

1366085120.0,1cfvtv,Digital Currencies,Trucidar,269,73,75,"This month EA has begun shutting down many of their Facebook games. They are offering no refunds on remaining balances

Personally, gift cards not being able to expire)

If a retail brick and mortar store suddenly said that all gift cards were going to be void within a month

Now this hypothetical gift card outrage would arise over a completely optional purchase. You do not need to buy gift cards to make purchases at these stores. With digital currencies, that currency is often valid until the company is forced to shut down. With this recent case, this is very much not the case.

In my opinion, steam allows you to pay directly, or out of a steam wallet) People do not buy digital currency so that they can have a little number next to their account. They buy it under the assumption that it will get them certain products and services. In this situation, people who spent money on digital currency are basically being told that their currency is worthless. This can occur in legitimate circumstances such as businesses going bankrupt in which case this is an accepted risk you take. But should it occur when a company in healthy economic standing decides it's simply going in another direction? To make a comparison, I feel this situation is vaguely similar to the situation in Cyprus where banks are using their customers money to bail the country out... except in this situation... there is no issue, they are simply taking the money. EA allowed people to put forward money for future services, and has now decided to pull out of their responsibilities to provide those services

Now personally, flouting rules against refunds, etc. I daresay, I don't feel they should be legal unless protected. I feel you should have the choice between paying with real dollars or using the currency.

I question the legitimacy of the currencies altogether. These currencies are obviously systems for generating higher incomes and forcing people to spend more than they really would.

They:

* Encourage people to buy more than they need by only allowing purchases in arbitrary set amounts. 
* Encourage people to leave money unspent by leaving you with odd/unspendable amounts of currency that are not enough to buy anything of use.
* Encourage people to throw money away because when you are left with, or waste it on a frivolous 80MS item.
* Mislead customers with strange conversions. 800ms points is $10. People will look at an item marked at 800, in Canada 800MS points is $12, despite relatively equal currency values, yet products are still marketed in Canada as being at the $10 price point (800MS).
* As this most current example points out, often with the promise of bonus currency, I imagine EA is going to make a hefty profit from undelivered services in this deal.
* Diminish consumer rights regarding refunds
* Limited use via uneven usage of currency. This is when companies have two stores. A store using the digital currency and a store using real currency. Examples include Blizzard and World of Tanks. Even though you may have money invested in their digital currency

To point out that this is not a purely anti-EA rant, you could sell items, but if you wished to cash out, you had to do so immediately or your money was permanently stuck in a blizzard wallet. This would not be so bad, but Blizzard than limited what sort of purchases could be made with this digital wallet. World of Tanks does this with it's gold currency, which is unusable in it's gift store (A store where limited edition and gift items are often sold, meaning even if you have a balance in their digital currency

In summary

At least, fun/successful ones. Going through my library I always deviate to one of my trusty fallbacks. This time, it was Doom. I wanted to play Doom 3, but Classic Doom will always be a close personal favorite of mine. So when I get bored playing through a single player campaign of Doom 3, it'll neither be a rant nor praise

First of all, and demon legions invade unto the human race, killing millions. Badass, true, but still enough opportunity to fall flat. I loved Painkiller but the love interest story arc is just too hokey, and not motivating enough. The fact that the Doomguy just doesn't give a shit about anything besides killing demons is awesome. Or maybe its because Romero and company left much of the story open-ended, allowing the player to fill in the gaps.

Next, unfortunately for players like myself this removes the player even further from the fantasy world that a player can get immersed in. Level design in the classic Doom games allowed the player to zip around, circle strafe around monsters and pick up all sorts of power-up goodies. It also allowed the level designer to build traps, alcoves, arenas, corridors, anything dedicated to the slaughter of countless enemies with a few thrills along the way. I must admit on a personal note, 16-bit sound effects, was plenty abstract

Finally, the sprites. Almost every jab uttered about the ""good ol' days"" in gaming pokes fun at how pixilated everything was. Yes, there were tons of huge, ugly pixels. But that never deterred me. If I find myself sneering at the pixels of an old game, it's because I spoiled myself by playing a more current game too recently. And yes, there were many games where the flat sprites in a 3D environment were downright terrible (read: Witchaven) and yet Doom got it right. For the most part, all the angles are fairly believable, either) and the edges are nice and clean and the monsters and figures have been rendered beautifully. I find myself tearing open a WAD just to study the Cyberdemon sprite, but I haven't seen a satisfying monster death since Doom. By using the sprites, well
 
Finally, but now that games are ""realistic"", the rules just don't allow it. How thrilling.

Well anyway, I'm having a difficult time discovering new games to lose myself in, and my frequency of picking up a controller is becoming less and less. I'm interested to hear anyone's thoughts, do you prefer old school game mechanics, or is there anything about the current batch of games that trumps the antiques? Let me know!

Instead of a simple yes/no vote with cream of the crop at the top, holds the funds for about 30 days, and if a certain financial number is hit, the game is greenlit and you get that game added to your inventory.  If those 30 days pass and the number is not hit, you are refunded the money.

Pros:  
1) Teenagers who just spend all day yessing zombies are suddenly cut out of the equation.  
2) It tells Steam ""yes
3) Ensures that devs have a chance without necessarily needing to maintain 80k+ votes.  
4) ???

Cons:  
1) People hate spending money on a maybe.  
2) Getting to that ALMOST number will be infuriating for devs.  
3) Steam could possibly abuse their power and reimburse the money via steam wallet instead of the method received (though this would be a pro for Steam

One idea I think is really strong is algorithmic building generation. One of the main distractions of Sim City and other city games was the pretty crippling recurrence of the same few building models. it seems to me that because the game already creates metrics for land value, then it would be a good way to avoid that problem by generating buildings based on them, perhaps with land value relating to height, pollution relating to cleanliness, etc and then adding randomly selected (by building type) 'flair' to make each building visually distinct and unique, be that sculptural elements, helipads, or whatever. The same could be done for civic buildings (though they would obviously have to have clear identifying flair, the buildings being built would vary, so I don't think it'd be too taxing for modern systems.

Something I did like about Cities XL was the ability to specify the routes for mass transit

Something I think was a good idea in Sim City 3000/4 that perhaps for technical reasons was never explored was the more bureaucratic side, their own tactics for the running their individual department would work well. One transport advisor could have emphasis on making sure everyone in the city was provided for, unlocking policies such as being able to construct ultra-small and cheap bus stops for rural areas, whilst another advisor could be focused solely on solvency, allowing the mayor to perhaps use cheaper, lower quality buses for instance. I'd also like to see more of a sense of community in game, through protests, fairs and things of that nature. Being able to establish a city fair for a week in a part of town could bring some income to the city at the cost of a slight and temporary increase in local crime

I liked the inclusion of the region map in Sim City 4, though, start out this way and become more organic over time. I'd also (possibly) like to see region-wide governance, with decrees having different effects on cities depending on how they're managed.

1376489067.0,1kcjle,Let Loose on the World: An Analysis of First Seeing the Open World in Bethesda Games,Mr_Spam_Man,275,82,165,"I originally posted this to my blog yesterday, as it is

The post:

While the biggest feather in their hat has always been their open worlds, your character has lived in an underground nuclear bomb shelter known as Vault 101 all their life, before a series of events forces them to leave their home and face the unknown world outside.

It may seem like a counterintuitive design choice to begin with a set path for the player if the rest of the game emphasizes freedom of choice, and themes of the game without being dropped headfirst into the world and feeling lost; and, most importantly, by initially limiting player exploration, they serve to make the reveal of the open world much more powerful.  Emerging from the sewers in Oblivion, or from Vault 101 in Fallout 3 were both awe-inspiring moments.  You simply had to stop and look around, reeling in the notion that everything laid before you was waiting to be explored.  These moments are what Bethesda games do best.  That feeling of truly being in a world bigger than you can imagine.  A world teeming with life and stories that you can only hope to discover.

But why doesn’t Skyrim‘s reveal feel like that?  At least in my experience, but being set free into Skyrim doesn’t have the same impact as in Oblivion or Fallout.

The problem can be found in the very first moments the player is presented with after emerging into the world.  That initial view of the world is critical to the feeling of freedom, and what Skyrim did wrong.

[Oblivion First View] (http://protogeektheblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/oblivion-first-view1.jpg)

This is the first thing you see after completing Oblivion‘s intro sequence.  You’ve just fought off assassins, caves, and sewers.  You look up and this is what you see.  Everything about this landscape is designed to make you want to explore the world.  The green hills and blue sky are a stark contrast to the dark, dank sewers you just left and make the world seem inviting.  The first thing your eye is likely drawn to are the ruins, nearly dead center on the screen.  Immediately, the game gives you something to explore (and some bandits to kill), a promise that the world will be filled with places like this one full of danger and mystery, tempting the player to see what’s on the other side and

[Fallout 3 First View](http://protogeektheblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/fallout-3-first-view.jpg)

The view presented in Fallout 3, brown, and brown.  Instead of having most our view blocked by hills and mountains like in Oblivion, we’re instead perched up on a cliff able to see the desolate, wasted landscape extending far out into the horizon.  And yet Fallout‘s world feels just as inviting as Oblivion even with this depressing view.  Part of this is due to our expectations for the game.  This is exactly what we want to see when playing a post-apocalyptic game.  Oblivion‘s cheery colors work well for its high fantasy tone, but in Fallout we want to experience the harshness of life without society and order, and that’s exactly what we get.  Also important are the easily recognizable American landmarks on the horizon.  We’re shown barely more than silhouettes of the Capitol Building and the Washington Monument

[Skyrim First View](http://protogeektheblog.files.wordpress.com/2013/08/skyrim-first-view.jpg)

And this is the view after escaping Helgen in Skyrim.  It’s certainly lovely to look at, but, like in Oblivion, part of that landscape is obscured, this time by tall trees.  The mountains on the side and in the background look jagged, steep, and hard to climb.  Unlike Oblivion‘s rolling hills

There are also a number of elements besides the landscape that distract from or hurt that feeling of awe in the world and the temptation to explore it.  First, and proceed to escape from the dragon attack.  Despite the second half of the intro being indoors and underground, that moment of magic we should feel when seeing Skyrim‘s wild terrain is partially stolen by the very first moments in the game.

Second, where you confirm your character’s look and skills.  This helps create a clear line with what came before and what comes next.  It let’s the player know that the real game is about to begin.  In Skyrim, the character and class stuff has all been streamlined, so there’s no need for a screen like that.  Instead, you simply walk out of a cave.  There’s no feeling that you’re truly leaving the intro behind and entering the world.

Lastly, and gives a bunch of dialogue about going to a nearby town.  The player is distracted from that special moment of seeing the game world for the first time by these two characters and this moment.  Instead of marveling at the world you can explore, you have to pretend to hide from a dragon and have some guy you don’t care about give you your next quest.

Now, love this game.  Like, favorite game of all time material.  But this is one big flaw I noticed the first time I played it in 2011, and I noticed it again after getting the game gifted to me on Steam just recently.  Bethesda games are all about the open world, and Oblivion and Fallout do such a good job of making that world feel accessible, inviting, and interesting in those first few moments of seeing it.  But in Skyrim they somehow managed to totally screw it up.  It’s just a good thing the rest of the game is absolutely filled with moments that make up for it.

Is that really all you want, to literally play the same game over and over? I know that's not really ALL they want, but that mentality seems to be hanging over Nintendo fans recently. Whenever the wii u gets criticized for its lack of games, everyone says ""wait for the first zelda/mario/Metroid game. It's not a Nintendo console until those franchises are out"" and that really does seem to have some truth to it not because those are the faces of Nintendo, but because those are the only franchises that Nintendo fans seem to want. Instead of recommending the current wii u games, the fans just say wait for the same old franchises we've been playing for the last 20 years. Why should Nintendo take the risk of new IPs when the fans scream for remakes of games from 1996? Why should Nintendo take the risk of new IPs when the fans say ""fuck the current wii u games, then it's a real console"". 
I'm not saying Nintendo should axe all their franchises

I understand not every Nintendo fan thinks this way and there are plenty of fans who want new IPs and enjoy the new wii u games

I could go on and on

EDIT: I feel like some people are missing the point of my post. I have nothing wrong with IPs I listed above or Nintendo as a whole. And I understand they need these IPs to stay afloat, are Nintendo only going to focus on those IPs and nothing else worth playing is going to come out on the wii u? As we've seen many times in the past, you can only milk a franchise for so long. Mario and Zelda may have withstood the test of time so far, but some fans are eventually going to grow tired of these franchises if that's all that's good about the console. That's basically what happened to me, I couldn't really find any other games I liked on the wii outside of the main franchises, so when I got tired of mario and zelda I started to look elsewhere.

Also I know the other consoles do this too with Uncharted/Halo, I have yet to hear ""I'm not going to buy the xbox one until Halo comes out"".

Sure, etc. Even some heist based games, like Payday: The Heist. All of this have been extremely simplistic though, and require basically no planning or strategy... just shooting.

I believe there are two relevant games being develop with heists as their core. The first one is Payday 2. Though you can see how the devs are making an effort on making it more than a glorified L4D clone
The same goes for the other heist game being developed, breaching safes via explosives, subduing guards, etc. However, you're always improvising with this systems. Never executing a perfect plan, but using what you find in your surroundings. You're more like a scavenger, less like a mastermind. And that's what a heist game should make you feel like; a mastermind


It's about beating a security system
Not through shooting your way through or infiltrating like in a stealth game, planning this exploit, and finally, at the climax, executing your plan. It should be 90% strategy, 10% execution. And at the execution itself, you shouldn't feel like you're improvising

Sometimes, calming them, using them. 

Some other times, their vaults, their alarms, their automatically police call, etc. 

And sometimes, about putting the spotlight and their attention to where nothing is happening, about making them look left, when you metaphorically go right. 

But most importantly, the execution should be the result of all the heavy work, go exactly as planned, and have a touch of showmanship to heighten the sense of being outsmarting your targets. 

To be honest, I may give this genre a shot. But I'd like to know your opinion on my points, and your thoughts on what would make a perfect heist game. Who knows, I may actually follow through an deliver (Disclaimer: I probably won't. Blame Reddit for my procrastination).

More dialogue options are possible and so many more things can be communicated.

2. The combat is based on advanced dungeons and dragons and I now realize why this is awesome. I guess Morrowind was much like that. And it makes sense for MMORPGs to use that system as well.

A while into the game, killing enemies silently reduced them to ash, erasing all traces of the body and eliminating the need to hide it. 

During a later mission

This was a big moment

I could fire a sleep dart and knock him out (as I usually did) but the other guards were mere feet away. There simply wasn't time. 

In a matter of milliseconds, each of their states of alarm growing higher. The first guard opened his mouth as if to exclaim and...

I froze time. His mouth half open, empathetic. I gazed at him and all the rest of the guards. It was beautiful. Suddenly he moved, the perfect image was broken. 

In an instant

I rushed forward, I rewired the barrier's circuits to repel them. 

I stood behind the barrier

The barrier was in fact lethal. As the guards rushed through to me, their bodies fading to ash, much like the first guard.

Suddenly it was silent. There were no guards

Corvo wasn't like this. He wasn't a killer. I wasn't a killer.

Biochock is a wonderful game with a great story (until the last hour), I believe it comes from one of the old 1up podcasts.

**Save the baby or eat the baby**

Believe it or not the saying actually pre-dates bioshock, which is great, but I love the way dishonored handles things.

**Killing people is easy

Most of your enemies in Dishonored are guards, but if you fail your mission to restore the rightful empress many more will die. You’re not batman, you can’t be expected to not kill anyone. And besides, there are people the game would completely understand if you wanted to kill.

But you eat ONE CHILD in bioshock and you’re a dick forever. There big place bioshock fucks up is giving you adam when you don’t kill the little sisters. Making your life easier by doing bad things would make for a richer story


**Dishonored is more reasonable in it’s assessment of you**

I don’t need to tell you how dumb the evil ending of bioshock was.

My friends refuse to play either SMG, and continue to praise Mario 64 blindly.

Ocarina of Time is a bit different. I am of the opinion that Twilight Princess is the best Zelda gameplay-wise, and took out everything I didn't like (pretty much whenever you're a kid), and then added a lot of new things. There was just so much to explore. A lot of my friends will admit that Twilight Princess is a great game, but Ocarina of Time is still superior.

I once wrote a tongue-in-cheek defence of the game using an alt, and thus never get a chance to experience it.

* **It's not that difficult.**

Really.  It's not.  It's a lot like a fancier version of Dungeon Keeper, and people who have played it for five minutes and uninstalled will loudly complain about its difficulty and how they're ""not going to play it without a decent UI and graphics"".  So we've got this situation where somebody will come across a DF discussion on Reddit and become interested in the game, but all they see in the comments are complaints that it's impossible, and jokes that it is too difficult for the average gamer to learn.

* **They are teaching you to play the game incorrectly.**

There's no right or wrong way to play Dwarf Fortress.  That's one of the things that's so amazing about it, or two hours of tutorial videos.  I don't think that's the right way to teach someone how to play a game.  

A game with a learning curve is like a musical instrument.  It requires a little bit of thinking and dedication, I'd have given up almost instantly.  Again: you learn by playing, and playing's more fun than studying.


So how do we begin playing Dwarf Fortress?  I'm going to give you just enough information to get you started

Remember one thing above all else: leave your pride at the door.  We're not trying to learn every detail of the game, and how much you want to master is then up to you.  Even at its most basic level the game is a ton of fun.  Think of it as picking a pre-rolled character just to get going rather than learning hundreds of stats and trying to make the perfect starting build before you even load the world.

Anything that has been skipped for the sake of easy learning can be re-enabled when you're comfortable.  Leave your pride at the door


**GETTING STARTED (AS QUICKLY AND PAINLESSLY AS POSSIBLE)**

[Download this.](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?0ls832k81pohir9)  Extract.  Open the Lazy Newb Pack program.  Click ""Play Dwarf Fortress"".  When you get to the menu screen

Using the Lazy Newb Pack, it's nigh-on pointless.  Use the program.  There is no reason not to, and it'll make your life a thousand times easier.


**PLAYING DWARF FORTRESS**

People say that it takes 20 hours just to learn the UI.  That is completely false.

Playing Dwarf Fortress is like going through folders on your computer, just go into the ""building"" folder by pressing the shortcut that's visible, 'b'.  From there, you can move up and down and press return to select a building or subfolder, or you can press the shortcut keys.

It might take 20 hours to become slick and memorise all the shortcuts without looking


**NAVIGATION**

* Use the number pad - it allows you to move diagonally.
* Arrow keys move around.  
* Return/enter to confirm.  It's like left-clicking.
* Space bar to pause.  Like Bioware and Paradox games, thankfully.
* Escape to go back.

* Press 'k' to get more information on a tile
* Press 'v' to get more information on units
* Press 'q' to interact with buildings.  Move the cursor to the building you want to interact with.
* Shift + &gt; and Shift + &lt; move up and down floors or 'z levels'.  Looks a bit funny when you write it out

Now go ahead and unpause the game.  Don't be scared, but here in our sandbox everything is peaceful.  You can take things at your own pace.

Everyone's just milling around at the moment


**ASSIGNING LABOR**

The command process is simple.  You don't control your dwarves directly, all free dwarves with the ""miner"" job (and a pickaxe) will go help.

Go back to the Dwarf Therapist program.  Dwarves on the left, so they're already miners.


**SETTING TASKS**

Tasks are mainly listed in the 'designation' menu in Dwarf Fortress.  This includes mining

So let's start by mining out some space for our dwarves to hang out in.  

* Go to the designation menu and select ""Downward Stairway"".  
* Pick a tile a few spaces north of your wagon and press enter to start your designation
* Now go down a floor (shift + &gt;) and put an ""Up/Down Stairway"" directly below your Downward Stairway.  
* Finally, move a couple of tiles and press enter again to confirm.  It'll fill in all the space between.

Now press 'escape' to quit out of the menus and wait for a few seconds.  Look!  There's your two miners!  They're doing what you told them to do!  Some of the cats might even wander in to keep them company while they work.  They will quickly clear out some clay


**STOCKPILES**

* Access the Stockpile menu.  You'll see there are stockpiles of many types
* Go to ""Custom Settings"".  
* Enable everything except corpses and refuse.  
* Press escape to go back.  
* Now select Custom Stockpile and designate the space you just cleared out as your stockpile the same way you would mine out an area.  
* Once again

Look!  They're all bringing stuff and dumping it onto the pile!  That's because dwarves have the 'hauling' job enabled by default


**GO PLAY DWARF FORTRESS**

If you've followed my instructions, building things, solving problems and assigning jobs.  Everything from here on is simply a matter of expanding upon this basic foundation.  You'll have to keep your dwarves happy by building beds and bedrooms, learn how to farm and brew your own booze, and create useless stone trinkets that you can trade to gullible trade caravans in return for yak cheese.  You'll fail a lot, you'll have to consult the wiki hundreds of times, and Google is the best friend you'll have

For now, but it's more rewarding than any pick-up-and-play game you could imagine.

http://www.gamespot.com/news/ea-consumers-enjoying-and-embracing-microtransactions-6404525

When the idea of DLC and Microtransactions gets brought up it tends to bring with it a statement not unlike ""I expect to get a full game"". 

Now this concept doesn't really sit right with me. Dont get me wrong I am completely behind the concept of ""getting your moneys worth"". However once you start bringing in the idea of the ""full game"" then we start being bogged down in what is defined as ""the full game"". If I were to use an example.

Friend of mine on another forums argued that *Kasumi: stolen  memory* was part of the full game of ME2 and it was not an extra. Now if we were going by this objectively ME2 was designed to have Kasumi in from launch. Early footage from a game show (I cant for the life of me find the source of this) showed the game with 2 placeholders long before launch (one for Zaeed and one for Kasumi) long before the game was launch the game was designed with the idea in mind that these would be in the game. So the idea that ""They left them out"" holds water. This falls under Totalbisquit's argument of ""If they were making this stuff under development then I expect it to be part of the standard product"". Now this is not an unreasonable position. As a matter of fact is a logical and reasonable position. The problem however is that game production (and general production for that matter) doesn't really work confined into two neat boxes of before and after launch. How do you qualify stuff like episodic games designed to be sold to you in digestible chunks? What about concepts taken up during development

Now to bring back my ME2 example. When I play games (with a singleplayer) I usually buy all the available DLC at the time of purchase. Then play it religiously for a week or so. And then leave it to reflect and never pick it up again. I bought ME2 one day one and more or less it went down like that. At no point in my experience did I go ""well something seems like it is missing"" so the concept of not having the ""full game"" was completely alien to me.

The definition is already very subjective and the water gets muddied even further when start talking F2P

So I ask if we cannot set an universal standard for what a full game is and have to rely on ""I feel it is/isn't a full game"" then what value does it bring to discussion? 

Or am I wrong and can we make an universal standard for what is considered a full game?",,t5_2sgq6,1362054347.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/19e4ge/the_full_game_concept/

Steam tells me that I spent 244 hours in Skyrim, I'm not sure how many hours in ME3 (I did 174 hours with ME2), and hours upon hours of Diablo 2 and civilization-building games.  I'm not an MMORPG gamer, which is something I don't feel like I'd be able to cross over into -- just not something I've been drawn toward.

Now it's been nearly two months since my last time playing anything past 20 minutes; I feel like I don't have the patience or care.  Sure

It's not like there is a gaping hole in my life from the absence of video games, reviews, but I just don't feel like sitting down and playing one for more than an hour.

1345727303.0,yoz8x,Just played KOTOR and KOTOR 2 for the first time.  Some thoughts on character-driven RPGs and their equipment.,TSED,256,70,112,"Alright, so despite it being their iconic look

As something seeking to emulate the grand epic fantasy, Xan's moonblade, Alyssa's ring, Edwin's necklace, etc. etc.  Those were generally inconsequential equipment slots, though.

Tabletop RPGs have a similar problem, or etc.).

In Dragon Age 2

But then I played KOTOR and, the seed of something possible has taken root in my mind.  KOTOR 2's upgrades are HUGE.  Mid game, upgrades are responsible for more power than the base equipment.  Customization of the upgrades allows the build you've worked towards for that specific character to be reflected in the equipment (DA2's great failing).  

Furthermore, Dashing_Rogue_04 has his custom made blaster-pistol / crossbow / whatever, but you could still equip the gigantic powerful base ranged item if you wanted to for any reason.

The trick here would be to have LOTS of options for item upgrades on the 'iconic' equipment and not as many (but definitely still some!) on the RARE (that part is important) other-equipment.  Sometimes you've got to assault a fortress head on and your silenced bolt-thrower isn't the right tool for the job

If you keep the instances of non-iconic equipment down, it'll be designed for unusual and specific circumstances so you will consider hanging on to it for a long time ANYWAY.  You don't want to make these other-items TOO rare, though, especially if you're running with a blank-slate protagonist.  A pre-selected character for you (a la Final Fantasy, or DA2 again, or etc.) would be okay with it for the same reason the NPCs need it.  Blank-slates a la KOTOR (early on), Baldur's Gate, and choosing out of a handful of options throughout the whole game would be very boring.  An unusually large selection to begin the game which quickly ramps down to ""normal"" may be a good direction to take that

So now you make the itemization game all about the upgrades you find.  That's an easy order

Note that this does not really apply to the ""third person looter"" types of games.  Borderlands or Diablo clones wouldn't work well with this

I was just randomly thinking about it today and remembered that it had some really cool elements.  The game is action heavy, engineer

Since the game is survival-horror to some extent (in some parts you fight humans and this stuff applies less), who gets the pistol, and occasionally, who goes empty handed.  This all ties into the game's trust system.  Giving someone a gun and ammo, healing them, killing aliens, shooting them up with some adrenaline, seeing corpses

Another element was that at any time one of them could be infected by the ""thing"" and secretly be an alien.  You had to watch for odd behavior and could do a limited number of blood tests.  You could also test yourself to make them trust you more.  If you tested someone who wasn't an alien

All of this (and more, (not to mention your own, the game was plenty scary).  This added so much to the experience, giving you some meaningful interactions with your AI buddies.

I think modern games could really improve in the area of having the AI react to you and the environment, giving you some choices that change the flow of the story and reactions of your squad.  However, there are so many greater possibilities.  A few ideas that come to mind:  The AI notices that your hit percentage is low and makes fun of your aim.  If you target an enemy that is attacking one them, their morale goes up and they get an attack bonus for a while.  You can upgrade their gear along the way, deciding who gets a rocket launcher or body armor you found.  

Obviously, and you do something truly evil, what if he didn't just whine about it, but actually broke from your party, attacking you or leaving and then hounding you throughout the rest of the game.

I have been interested lately in classifying battle systems across the very diverse world of RPGs. I was hoping to get some thoughts from you.

First

1. Scripted - Final Fantasy Tactics
2. Random - Pokemon
3. Active - Diablo, Dark Cloud 2
4. Enemy on the map - [Grandia](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrK1MZoVVGg)

Second

1. Real-time (i.e. characters act independently of one another)
2. Turn-based (i.e. typically involves committing to an action one character at a time)

There are games such as Valkyria Chronicles and Grandia that blur the line between the aforementioned flows of combat.

I feel that, shooter, beat 'em up, etc):

1. Standard? - Diablo, Kingdom Hearts
2. [Pausable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-keeping_systems_in_games#Pausable_real-time) - Fallout 3, Dragon Age: Origins
3. [Linear Motion Battle System](http://www.giantbomb.com/linear-motion-battle-system/3015-219/) - ""Tales of"" games

Turn-based games are

1. Random - Final Fantasy I ([explanation](http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/561981-final-fantasy-origins/54877608))
2. Phases - Wizardry ([explanation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-keeping_systems_in_games#Special_turns_and_phases))
3. ""Global"" unit order - Final Fantasy Tactics ([explanation](http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Charge_Time#Final_Fantasy_Tactics))
4. ""Local"" unit order (""We go

Also

1. Axonometric (e.g. isometric, bird's eye, top-down, etc) - Diablo, Pokemon and *many* more...
2. 1st-person - Skyrim
3. 2nd-person (controlling the main character through the eyes of a peripheral character) - God of War 3, but this perspective is rare)
4. 3rd-person - Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

And these environmental abuses of the abilities are sidestepped, either by reducing how obvious they are, or having the enemies not cluster around them waiting.

Would this be possible to implement in games? Have games implemented it beyond ""hard"" difficulty? 

Separately, where there were ranged weapons and you needed to think about dispatching large groups. Is it just a limitation of Rapture itself do you think? How is the claustrophobic world used to an advantage for gamers?

I should now note I have never read the book. When I say it was not successful I don’t mean as an adaptation but rather that it did not succeed at what it set out to do.

**Problem #1: too much story variance in all the wrong places**

The first thing you do is select your character from a list of mercenaries. On my play through I picked my favorite, their role specifically is randomized.

This is a bad idea. All of the characters have personality but not so much that they can not interchangeably serve any function in the story that everyone else does. Essentially they have no motivation or wants of their own but they have distinct affectations and quirks

Then there’s you. You have a paragraph long back story

So I pick my character (an Irish soccer hooligan) and in the opening scene you take a taxi cab to the home of “The Jackal”. “The Jackal” is an arms dealer who is evil because he is perpetuating a war by supporting both sides. Spoiler alert

You get to his apartment, and then the building you’re in blows up. This is an awesome way to open a game.

**Problem #2: 30 hours with no motivation**

So the story from that point until the last act is basically you take missions from the two competing sides in a civil war going on in the war torn African nation of… Africa. Your motivation for doing this is that there is a blip on your map telling you to. Neither side really says anything about helping you find The Jackal which is ostensibly why you stay in Africa. You do nothing to pursue him until you randomly happen upon him, which is a pretty good reason to hightail it to a country with perhaps better medicine available. 

To make sure I had my facts right I periodically referred to the surprisingly extensive far cry 2 wiki

If you chose a side I guess we would infer you believe in and care about this conflict however you literally have to do missions for both sides. At no point during the game did I understand what the difference between the two sides was or why I was doing missions for them.

**Problem #3: Irish Soccer Hooligan Vs. The World**

The population of the African nation of Africa: .5% foreign mercenaries, 99% completely interchangeable re-spawning bad guys. You can’t even tell which side your opponents are on in the war. Every mission starts with the quest giver saying that this missions is very secret and as such his men will still kill you on sight if they see you just like they would anyone else. Ignoring the logic of them killing all unaligned people on sight, and the fact that after being briefed your companions immediately know exactly what your mission is without being told, Irish Soccer Hooligan is not Sam Fisser. My main weapons where one of those grenade machine guns like the demo man has and two things I never used because I had a grenade machine gun.

Far cry 2 is an open world that contains nothing but mooks who want to kill you immediately for ill defined reasons. [See this map?](http://farcry.wikia.com/wiki/Far_Cry_2_map) the yellow parts are where people don’t shoot you on sight (except the ones in the lower right corner). Those areas are still filled with interchangeable re-spawning bad guys

That said

**Problem #4: 2 hours with terrible motivation.**

Near the end of the game you are re-introduced to The Jackal and my first reaction was “who the fuck is that?” because I had dropped the game for a month before coming back to it. His voice acting, he starts using words like “we’ and “us” to describe his mission, and according to the mission blips on my map, my only window into the psyche of Irish Soccer Hooligan, I agree with him. We are a team now. When he saves your life you’re incapacitated. When he steals your diamonds he has the drop on you. When you meet him in the prison you have all your guns and nothing is stopping you from killing him other that the hand of the developer. Killing this guy has been your only motivation for 28 hours and now you are apparently on his side.

During a mission to get The Jackal back the diamonds he stole from you (… okay… whatever) all of your buddies, but are going to kill you. This might be out of character for them for all I know. You rekill all of your buddies, take the diamonds, bring them back to The Jackal (sure, why not) and he lays out his plan. He intends to blow up a bridge to prevent the soldiers from escaping and bribing the border patrol to allow all of the civilians (who apparently exist) to leave. He tells you one of you will blow up the bridge, and die in the process, and the other will take a briefcase full of diamonds to the border, and kill themselves. He let’s you choose.

Holy shit, and fly to a country where malaria is [fully treatable](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malaria#Prognosis
).  Fuck the civilians

Twist ending

The Gordan Freeman thing doesn't work in this game because I have no window into my character’s motivation other than his contradictory actions.

This game tried a lot of thing. It wanted to be a dark existential examination of the horrors of war and effects of opportunistic sociopaths on innocent civilians, but I couldn’t.

Every RPG I've ever played has had a main storyline. Why is that, it obviously makes sense. But for something like Elder Scrolls or Fallout 3/NV, it seems like they could easily do without a primary storyline. 

It seems to me that many people seem to assume RPG also means ""story game"" where the story is a major part of the game. While this is obviously true

I, I don't want to stumble upon some legendary artifact. Most importantly, I don't want the world to treat me like I'm the only one that can solve their troubles. Why does every villager ask me to save their kid, or find their lots heirloom, or whatnot? I'm just some traveler as far as they know. And if it's a society where people all help each other out, why am I the only one that seems to be doing anything? I just want to be a blank slate that I can build from the ground up.

I feel like having this more freeform style of gameplay would be really conducive to sandbox games. I recall Fable

It seems like this especially pertains to the Elder Scrolls series. I have 100 hours in Skyrim and have not yet finished the main storyline. I probably played Morrowind for about 200 hours and never so much as touched it beyond delivering Caius Cascades his package. These games really don't need a main storyline

I want to feel mortal, I should be praying that I can finish the fight, let alone living to see another day. Crushing blows that result in crippled arms and legs would take time to heal outside of the arena, and if that happened whilst you were fighting, you'd end up dropping your shield or weapon or limping due to a strike to your leg. The same should be for opponents, armour can only do so much, and striking where your enemy isn't armoured should be paramount to your success, arm and leg armour being broken after repeated strikes would result in an opening which could allow for a killing blow.

Eventually, as you got to the end game, you would fight multiple opponents and (perhaps) people on chariots or (more realistically) other skilled gladiators who are more heavily armoured than yourself with better weaponry. Once you've defeated all the game has to offer (I'm thinking a fair few fights, but that's up to the creators of the game if there ever *is* a creator of the game) you have a choice, to retire with your freedom (some sort of ending cutscene with your gladiator's statistics readily available at a character history screen or something) or to fight until you die on the sands, different cutscene and so on).

I honestly don't understand the ""open world"" mentality of ignoring the main quest - especially if there's a sense of urgency involved. I understand the novelty of it sure. However

This is what I mean - in the usual Heroic Journey (not just Joseph Campbell, there's a period of inaction in which the Hero doesn't want to go. Then there's a scene that brings them right back in. It's a moment that could happen quickly or after a long period of time (there have been whole movies based on the ""refusal of the call"") - like Luke Skywalker's refusal and need to go back to his uncle's farm, only to find them dead and killed by the Empire pulling them back in. Or as quickly as [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wbdFG_C3zN0). 

If Link never accepts his quest, as someone who isn't a killer - would be too scared or cowardly to go and directly after them. So add a scene where - in hunting - he finds the recently dead corpse of one of his bros, or more open world-y - he finds himself stalked by pirates unless he frees the area. That you can't just ""go out and do whatever you want"" without consequence. This was actually one of my problems with Oblivion, and Fallout 3. That there was a main quest but there was no consequence if I waited it out or didn't pursue. It'd always be waiting there for me.

Don't get me wrong - I LOVE open world games - Just Cause 2, Fallout,and Fallout 2 had schedules that you had to keep. If you veered too far away, you'd ""lose"". You'd still be able to play the game (Star Control 2 has an excellent sequence where the big evil ""wins"" and slowly starts tearing down all the spheres of influence of all the races you've met - while you're still exploring), but you see the consequences of inaction.

Further, or the hero they sent instead died, so they came to you again (and it's your brother!), or a your little sister is picked by a lottery so she will die if you don't go in her stead (I know, I know).   You have to be willing to accept the consequences of inaction.

This week it's [""Period Accurate Racism in Gaming""](http://www.reddit.com/r/pocgaming/comments/1i9gle/weekly_discussion_thread_periodaccurate_racism_in/), from Dances with Wolves to Gran Torino.

My response to the thread is below, Bioshock: Infinite, GTA San Andreas and TWD.  It's long, so I apologize ahead of time.

The **TL;DR** I found is that one should make characters well rounded over ""that racist guy"" and ""that racial trope"".  And that it's a problem across media

---

I would argue this problem isn’t endemic to games

First - my background.

This is a hard one for me, half white.  I grew up in white middle class neighborhoods in the US and therefore am pretty privileged.  I have both white and asian family who are not as privileged.  The white half of my family is southern, (Mississippi actually), and I even have some Klan members in my family history.  The other half has been members of everything from the AFW movement to certain asian foreign armies (though historically on the US’s side).  I’m no stranger to racism, even having confrontations with certain skinheads. I'm lucky to not have severe repurcussions because of the color I've been born in.   

I’ve also studied it heavily

Now a story.

Back in college I joined a LARP group and we had quite a few vampire games.  Two that I participated in had race involved.  

The first was a **Vampire LARP** set in NYC at the turn of the 19th/20th century.  The idea was that the Camarilla (the ""civilized"" guys) are going to have their first major battle with the newer

It was one of the best and intense (gaming) experiences of my life.  The character I was given was an Eastern European born immigrant as well as Tremere Primogen.  I asked the Storytellers if my character faced immigrant discrimination, and they frankly believed I'd be more sensitive to these issues.

I solved two of the central mysteries by playing racist and sexist.  Two Native American Gangrel showed up, I had an ""assistant"" Tremere who was female, and I kept sending around doing menial tasks.  Right in the Tremere clan book, it refers to them as notoriously sexist, especially early on.  So I was making her jump through hoops to even get an audience with me.  

Turned out, with the exception of at one point saying 'savages"".  (Edit) Playing racist somehow *helped* me solve the game as the STs used both gender and race to hide them to players with more modern sensibilities.

The next was one I created based in a **Steam Punk Wild West.**  We have a multi-racial group, native americans, germans, irish, and mormons.  This was an odd choice and made many uncomfortable - particularly the people of color that portrayed some of them (I did have some caucasians want to play non-caucasians and vice versa mind you).  I gave two characters a perk ""From the future"" and they were the most interesting - they allowed the systemic racism to bother them and fit into their roles.  The PoC character from the future snapped at the population as uncivilzed savaages, while the non-POC character felt guilty for enjoying the benefits. 

I should reiterate - this was amongst a group of friends who ALREADY KNEW one another. When it came down to it

**Bioshock: Infinite** has been mentioned several times, while imagery reflects early Mormonism, and then there's really odd looks at conflating racism with the labor movement.  Not to mention having some progressive stances toward feminism (there are female enemies, presumably at high levels).

I think - and I've said before - it misses a few things.  While it's true that the Woman's Suffrage movement specifically ignored the plight of women of color, and redefined Imperialism of the time.  You see - The States was trying to find a way to hold two conflicting ideas.  One that the States was born out of an oppressive regime and stands for freedom, and Two that the States whould be allowed to expand and create their own colonies.  The ""Exceptionalism"" aspect of this was that somehow America was allowed to expand as they understood how to free people.  And that the uncivilized didn't know/deserve to free themselves.  Hence, we ""bring democracy"" to the Philippines, to the Western Territories, to Alaska, and the rest.  In other words, they'd devolve into a riot of a revolution

I think there's something interesting to be said for **GTA: San Andreas**.  Somehow in Rockstar's ""writing by parody of existing media"" they ended up telling an interesting story about race (except with our blind chinese guy Wu ""Woozie"" Si).  Most oddly, and most importantly the '92 Rodney King Riots.

Only instead of 4 white guys who beat up Rodney King

I think it's important not to forget the past

I think the most interesting version of this in other media is probably **Deadwood**.  Deadwood is about despicable people in a despicable town in a despicable time.  It still has an interesting cast, but keeps his people fed and surviving through deals with the big man in town all the time.  The thing is - this exists for many immigrant populations, and the Chinese are not an exception.  Today, this gets stereotyped as Triads and Tongs - but those are far more recent than this.  The issue is that the law and government can't be trusted to handle problems in these communities, so they govern themselves.  Wu is one such leader.  He's a nuanced version of a racist stereotype, with his own concerns and definitely a cause for concern in the narrative.  You can see him seething from all the racism lumped in his direction as well.  But it's how he and his community have learned to live within and without the systemic racism of the time.

And that's how it needs to be done.  With nuance and understanding that characters - even racist characters or characters of an oppressed race.  They aren't ""noble savages

For example, growing up in the American South.  It's yet another obstacle he has to overcome with allies he needs to make to survive.

Here's a brief overview

The article presents a theory of psychology that individuals are motivated by either performance or mastery (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal_theory#Mastery.2Fperformance). ""It turns out there are two different ways people respond to challenges. Some people see them as opportunities to perform - to demonstrate their talent or intellect. Others see them as opportunities to master - to improve their skill or knowledge.""

In GTA, they'd eventually find you if you stood in the same place long enough.

I just wanted to talk about the effort that development teams put in to these kinds of mechanics.

Driver 3 (as old and mostly bad as that game was) had some good ideas as far as police detection goes. There was a wanted level attributed to the car you were driving as well as yourself, you didn't have a wanted level on your person so when you were out of line of sight, you could get out of the car and not have a wanted level. But, like in real life, the car you were driving instantly had a level on it that no matter where you were and drew attention from police and it always was there on just that car you committed crimes in.  GTA 4 only had wanted level on your person, and it made it seem like it didn't matter what car you were in, they'd find you anyway. (Albeit changing cars mid chase reduces the distance to which they'd detect you but still)

What about other games? The overarching idea here is that there is a certain threshold that has to be crossed for you to enter into a 'I'm in danger and detected by the enemy' that makes it interesting and encourages you to not (or to get caught) doing bad things depending on wether you wanted a fight or not.

The second approach is to create entire new weapon designs; Dead Space was a pioneer in this regard.

Here's why. I personally believe it makes the game fairer and more fun. Since there is usually a copious volume of ethanol consumed throughout the evening, you still have a chance at a comeback and finishing on the podium. It also prevents the CPU opponents from getting too far away, which means that there will be more action and missiles fired and stuff.

But, one of my friends will look in the game settings and realize that the handicap is on. Ironically, it's usually whoever's on a losing streak, and they will throw a tantrum about it. They say it's unfair because it adds too big an element of chance in the game and doesn't leave place to real talent. They say whoever wins is probably who got the best powerups towards the end of the race, which I admit is true.

To condense the 22-minute video to its essentials: Tom McShae harangues EA executive Greg Goodrich for the alleged dissonance between Medal of Honor: Warfighter's gameplay and the realism purported by its advertising campaign. McShae's argument centers on features that he deems unrealistic

I'm not here to discuss the veracity of the Gamespot editor's point, yet incomparably important point which seems to have escaped Mr. McShae's attention: 

**Medal of Honor: Warfighter isn't unrealistic because of regenerating health. The game is unrealistic because it offers a completely skewed

I should mention here that I played and reviewed Medal of Honor 2010 for a prolific gaming website. And upon testing the game, I expected a sober look at a war which few support and even fewer understand. What a fool I was. 

Instead

Sure

But what about the Shinwar massacre? What about the warlordism

In the end

Most other war games, you were witness to summary executions at the hands of Al-Asad's troops. Heck, even World at War gave you the option of killing unarmed German soldiers, simply to give you a role in the escalating hatred felt on all sides. 

When I heard the new Medal of Honor was going to be realistic, the game held onto the ""They hate us for our freedom"" rhetoric and used it to justify my destruction of villages and their inhabitants. 

As a non-American

As a student of political history

And as a Somali, unrepentant pirates of Somalia (who, upon closer inspection, are actually victims of European energy conglomerates, the destablizing influence of the American War on Terror and foreign fishermen). 

Is EA trying to inculcate its players with pro-America messaging? Probably not. But the fact that the developer has worked closely with (and have standing charitable arrangements for) the Pentagon is easily evident. You won't find a single anti-war sentiment in this game; EA's military partners have ensured that.

But maybe I'm holding the game to an unfair standard. Forgive me

Ok

I didn't like Bioshock.

Let me explain why.  I suppose a part of it could be because of the immeasurable hype that surrounds the game.  I played it a few short months ago

Don't get me wrong, beyond that I don't have much to say about Bioshock.  I frequently hear people cite the game's story as one of the best in any video game.  But really, I didn't think there was much to it.  It's supposedly a commentary on objectivism, but I don't really see it.  It didn't seem like a commentary on objectivism so much as a game with a universe in which objectivism *exists*.  Sure, Andrew Ryan's created a city where man is not restrained by anyone else, but this objectivism never really concerns the player.  You just enter Rapture and the game immediately tells you ""oh no, look what happened to this city run by an objectivist

I guess I should comment on the famous [twist](/spoiler) as well.  [The twist midway through Bioshock is admittedly quite ingenious.  I get how it's a commentary on games that's unprecedented.  However, and I had to force myself to keep playing.](/spoiler)

I don't want to say anything about the gameplay

And that's pretty much all I have to say about Bioshock.  Looking at videos of Bioshock Infinite in action, and I don't really plan to considering what I've heard about it).

What do you guys think?  Did Bioshock deserve all the praise it got?  Why/why not?  If there's one thing I'd like to ask, please tell me!  I *want* to hear why I'm wrong and this game is great.  But the last thing I want to see is this post getting downvoted into oblivion without anyone explaining to me why I'm wrong.

The game was mostly very average (stiff controls, but the combat mechanics are something that stuck with me strongly, so please bear with me.

I walk around the corner towards the bum, and he immediately brandishes a handgun from his pocket. ""Oh crap, I guess I have to kill this guy instead"", I think as I sprint towards the man while smashing the attack button (your only weapon at this point is an unloaded gun). Curiously though, my character does nothing, which was luckily just before this section. I begin wondering if melee attack is invoked by another button while I swiftly engage the bum again and get shot down just as fast as last time. ""Why does my character not attack?!""

The fourth time I turn the corner and stand there defiantly. I stand and wait for the survivor once again to decimate me with his pesky handgun, haul my ass along the correct path and confusedly exit the sewer.

Turns out, I felt totally retarded for not understanding this, as the game even had a hint about it on the loading screen. But really, when you think about it, this is such an old trope of game design that it just feels natural. When an enemy draws his gun in a game, you don't press a button to ask him to chill, you press a button to kill him so you can advance to the next section.

1363931962.0,1asarp,What made Runescape's crafting system exceptional.,ToastWithoutButter,261,90,156,"**This is my first post here on /r/truegaming

I’m kind of surprised that nobody has mentioned Runescape’s crafting system. Now

From what I’ve been reading, or FFXI, but it is a system that has managed to persist and keep players engaged for over 12(!) years. To sum it up concisely, it is a system that has fostered a strong economy that allows for both old and new players to earn steady incomes and reap immense benefits at the highest of skill levels. The heart of Runescape’s gameplay has always been about earning money and the concept of “training” skills has seemingly been nothing more than a natural byproduct of that philosophy. Mindless gathering skills such as woodcutting, mining, or fishing, are only seen as worthwhile because the players understand that they’re earning money and they will continue to earn exponentially more money as they invest more and more time in their particular skill of choice. Of course, herblore

Now

**It takes a long LONG time to reach the high levels where real money can be made.**

&gt;This guarantees that the market will not be flooded with high level goods and it gives crafters a massive sense of accomplishment for reaching such high skill levels.

**New players aren’t alienated because gathering skills are always necessary for finding resources and anyone can pick them up to immediately start earning some money.**

&gt;This allows the economy to always have plenty of resources available for crafters and it helps to retain new players that would otherwise be scared away by the massive time investment required to earn “real” money on the production side of crafting.

**The focus of the game is on earning money

&gt;This means that the game isn’t “over” once a player maximizes their combat level. In fact, food, etc.

To clarify my first point, but in months. The measly amount of time it takes to reach max level other MMO’s I’ve played is laughable compared to Runescape and that is what makes all of the difference.

My second point can be argued against in the sense that almost any other game allows players to sell materials to crafters too

I also want to clarify my third point by saying that many modern MMO’s seem to focus on the player being the one to find their own loot. This makes trading, Y, or Z equipment on their own. This makes the focus not so much on earning money, but instead on fighting monsters, which is fine unless you want an engaging crafting system. The incredibly low drop rate for rare items in Runescape is what compels players to buy equipment instead of find it.

To ensure longevity in a game and give players that sense of playing in a virtual world, then I would expect it to have a bright future. This is something I have been hoping to see for years to no avail.

I'll recount two experiences I had last night

----

I've finished a quest and now have to return to my guildhall to receive another, and following a river a short distance. Although I could easily fast-travel and be given my next quest within minutes, I decide to walk, as this is how my character would have to actually make the journey. To receive a quest at the culmination of my journey will be a reward.

As I approach the mountain I'm quickly presented with the problem of how to get around it. I enjoy attempting to climb mountains, I creep around a boulder to discover a young redguard woman trying to convince her argonian companion to let her delve into the cave and hunt for adventure. It's easy work picking such an unwary woman's pocket, and I discover a note from her father, telling her not to trust the argonian bodyguard; he writes that she's to return home when she grows weary of her little game. A similar note in the argonian's robe tells him he will live to regret it if she comes to harm through his inaction. Having used my thievery skills to get a handle on this situation I present myself, feeling pity for the plight of the worried father. I agree to help, and I'm soon trying to keep up with the eager girl as we press deeper into the snow-swept cave. I kill numerous powerful enemies, many of whom bring the girl the point of begging for mercy. 

Without spoiling the conclusion of this mini-quest, and discover a path out the other side of the mountain. Seeing the mining town at the base of this windswept mountain reminds me that I can't dwell on her fate, and I resume my goal of returning to my guildhall--which now seems more appealing for its warmth, rather than just being a dispensary of quests.

On the way, wearing the finely crafted clothes of a merchant. He's not some bandit or cultist, which are clearly Skyrim's *true* danger: I've walked the length of the land, and I'm in a good position to weigh the threat of countless bandits and outlaws against the political gesturing of rich, prejudiced outlanders. (My character has additional reasons to hate the Thalmor, ever since an incident involving a cruel noblewoman and a barmaiden employed at their embassy.) Despite having doubts about being able to defeat three well-armed guards with only unremarkable armor to protect me, I approach the procession. The Thalmor immediately draw their swords,"" and will be interrogated until he reveals ""secrets."" Knowledge of Thalos is a ridiculous reason to torture someone, this is something I'm going to stop.

Once they are almost out of sight I creep along in the scrubland's modest cover, hard-earned collection of ebony arrows--a mere pawfull--into my quiver, and watch the guards loudly shuffle, single-file, on the cavern floor below. I dip the first arrow into an elixer of paralysis-causing plants and roots--a refined potion of my own alchemical devising, and notch it. I steady my breath, pick the right moment, an arrow piercing through the center of his elven armor

1318971129.0,lgoxh,Demon's Souls made me a better gamer,ShadyJane,203,36,135,"A week ago I noticed Demon’s Souls was $18 on amazon and figured I’d finally take the time to see what so many people seem to be raving and/or raging about.  It was delivered last Tuesday and I rushed home from work to finally give it a go.  During that first night I had played for 4 hours and I got up to 2-3k souls twice and lost them all…twice.  I had to put the game down and walk away.  I wasn’t mad.  I wasn’t even bothered.  I was blown away at how much this game made me self-reflect on my abilities/inabilities.  It is a trait devoid from every other single player game in memory.

There was never a question in my mind as to why I died.  I took on too many enemies at once.  I wasn’t careful on the stairwell/cliff edge.  I mashed buttons because I was nervous.  I tried to heal before getting enough distance.  I don’t have enough endurance to block a strong attack.  Why did that normal attack break my block?  I didn’t lower my shield to regain endurance fast enough to block the next attack.  Everything could be pinpointed and the cause was invariably my fault.  However

Skip a little further ahead and I’m towards the end of 1-2…where there are two blue-eyes knights and a handful of archers waiting for you after evading the fire breathing dragon on the bridge.  I died there 21 times.  Count it.  21.  That’s not even counting the deaths before 1-2.  I’m not counting the deaths while learning the level.  I’m only counting the times I died at the end.  That’s 21 times of making it over the bridge only to be killed by the knights.  Now just to qualify this: I didn’t have the thief’s ring

I felt like I was beating my head against a steel wall

I eagerly ran to the corner he was guarding and the first player-message I read was a simple “Welcome”.  This was more profound to me than I can adequately describe.  The welcome wasn’t just for getting to the new area; it was also a “welcome to the club”; “welcome to the next step”; it was akin to the camaraderie you experience at events like marathons where everyone is just rooting for everyone else.  I felt empowered and knew exactly how to utilize such feelings.  I teabagged those two blue eyes knights and as I imagined my digital genitalia plopping onto the supposed mouths of these two hell spawn I realized that the giant red dragon was annoying  me and therefore needed to die.  Soul levels?  Hah!  I’ll take 10

Demon’s Souls taught me that I am to blame for everything (including success!).  It taught me to be overly objective in analysis.  It taught me that patience ALWAYS pays off.  It taught me that eagerness leads to mistakes.  More than anything else it taught me that the last laugh is the best laugh.  SUCK IT FALSE KING!!  These are probably things most people already know in gaming but don’t practice.  I didn’t

Oddly enough I am now also better at Starcraft2 (Plat league /flex)…

**TL;DR for those on the fence – This game is not hard.  It is completely and utterly unforgiving.  If you cannot handle the idea that YOU make mistakes and YOU need to learn from them then you will never complete or enjoy this game.  It’s not for everyone and that’s the beauty of it.**

**Pros:**  
Tons upon tons of customization. The passive skill tree is massive and how you skill changes your character completely. It makes it a lot of fun to level up and plan out your skills and it makes you feel like your character is uber unique. 

Skill gems are a lot of fun. Its awesome to be able to mix and match your spells as you want and still be able to level them up. Also support gems are awesome. Want to throw fireballs that split into more fireballs as they hit people? Or do you want to make your lightning arrows fire 5 instead of 1 and then pierce? Easily done. This level of customization makes the character feel like it is yours. Makes it feel like you are roleplaying more so than most games. 

Large variety of monsters and they attack in different ways and each provide their own challenge. 

PvP

No constraints. If midway through the game you want to spec your warrior to be an archer. Just grab the passive skill that lets bows scale off of strength and go for it. 

Graphics are pretty damn good. Especially on the spells. Arrows stick into people when you shoot them and into walls when you miss.  

They have a fucking sweet

THE FUCKING AMAZING BARTER SYSTEM. 


**Cons:**  
Shitty map. Seriously it needs work. It is often hard to tell what is a wall and what is a path on the map. 

Learning curve is a little rough for the first few hours of the game as there is so much customization and very little direction.

They story is barely noticeable. I have gotten through the first act and all I can really say is I was exiled to a different continent and now I am killing monsters. Oh and the witch is fucking bonkers. 

Can't remap mouse buttons. And the game thinks you want to use your mousewheel as a button. We don't. No one has ever wanted to do that ever. Especially since you also have that mapped to zoom. I don't want to zoom in on that monkey. I want to flame his ass. 

PvP

**Summary:**

The game is awesome but has a lot of work to be done on it. I fully expect the map and mouse buttons to be fixed

Recently I had replayed the original .Hack// quadrilogy. The fake mmorpg that I played in the game was better than any mmorpg I have played
  
The bettering of MMOs depends solely on the removal of saftey nets
  
Currently in mmos you are given a set purpose from the beginning, and e-mails from other player. Your first thought might be, well if the player isn't given a purpose, he will just do nothing However, while they may have no goal at first, they will start to look for other things to do. While at the same time, another player will need something that he can't get without assistance. The player with nothing to do sees the player and need and suddenly he is no longer bored, these players will actively look for a purpose, time frame, but it also creates a stronger game community based on co-operation.  
  
Part of this player driven system would be the need to remove ALL safety nets. The best example of this in ""The World"" is the fact that you can be killed any where outside of town, and if you are killed you lose all progress gained from when you left town. At first you might think, but then high level players would be able to go into low level areas and ruin the game for them. Well let's say that were to happen, and these high level players were ruining the game for the noobies. Well one of these new players can post about it on the request board. Then a group of high level players think, ""what a jerk."" and they go hunt down the guy killing new player, maybe they form a squad to enforce this. BAM, that anti-player killing squad just gave the player a goal of which is theoretically endless. The other thought that comes with this proposal, the way they solve them is just another thing on the list of 'stuff to do in this mmorpg'. Moreover, made of real personal bonds.

1358232712.0,16lttd,Why I absolutely LOVE The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings **BEWARE!!! SPOILERS!!!**,Plato_Karamazov,245,80,161,"I have just finished The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings tonight

I should mention that I have previously played The Witcher 1 and a lot of my actions in AoK were dictated by what I did in the first game (joining the Scoia'Tael

For the first time in a very long time, and I was often to choose between several bad options.

In the first game, the one quest where the prostitutes were vampires and were attacked by the Order of the Flaming Rose, I chose the good option for bad reasons. I had chosen in the end to marry Triss and adopt Alvin. 

In the second game, and I told her in the Elven bath that I would find the Kingslayer and settle down with her. I stayed true to this goal through the game, eventually condemning Phillipa and Sile to death, and almost getting Iorveth killed. I also declined sex with Cynthia after completing the Dearhenna quests, remembering that she had put Triss in the figurine.

But far beyond that, not to be hidden on bookshelves waiting to be picked up and read at the player's leisure, but rather put forth as a necessary medium for storytelling within the game. The histories of the monsters and where they came from, as well as the overarching narrative of Yennefer and the Wild Hunt are incredibly constructed and display a kind of storytelling very rarely seen in games, particularly those as violent and unforgiving as The Witcher. 

I want to make a particular note here on violence and the (lack of) value of human life in The Witcher. When we walk into Flotsam and witness the hanging, the amount of backstabbing and betrayal in AoK rivals that of even Final Fantasy Tactics, which itself was Shakespearean in its body count. 

Some games, save for off-color Lord of the Rings references. Very rarely is any of the pervasive despair within the world of The Witcher ever alleviated.

I am most pleased, he is an extremely worthy and intelligent adversary who meticulously calculated his every move, and has no misguided lofty goals, save for the restoration of his own Witcher's School. Nor is there any other reason for them to be fighting than for the sheer fact that Letho framed Geralt for the murder of King Foltest and the mutual respect for having eluded each other for nearly the entire game.

On the subject of kings, even as he protected him.

Please watch the above 15 minutes of gameplay and ponder how little of that actually made it into the game:

- Non-aggressive NPC's that don't realize who you are until you do something drastic

- Elizabeth reacts to the environment prompting conversations which build depth and character.

- Very dense scenes with NPC setpieces creating a far richer tapestry of the world that you are exploring. Only the opening level of the shipped product is as rich as this scene.

- Vigors based on an inventory stock instead of a refillable mana bar.

- Very, combat on the skylines, and ""3D"" combat (Ground, Skyline, Zeppelin)

- AI that is noticeably more advanced than the current

- Dialogue that is present in the shipped product, remember). Elizabeths line in the trailer where she mentions asking Comstock for help escaping is itself a potent indicator that the story was vastly different.

- The flowing Vox banners feature Daisies face projected on them in a very 1984-esque fashion, truncated, in a few sections.

After having gone back and watched several of these

It honestly feels like the Infinite which was released is either an earlier build than what is shown in these videos

- Vox Cyphers &amp; Crows Chests are both implied to be recurring elements

- In the first level, where enemies were not instant-hostile zerglings, but is useless in the release build as all enemies shoot on sight.

- The previously inventory-based vigor system appears to have been changed *very* late in development

- The design of many early levels, and not designed for Combat. I suspect these were originally built as the ""hub"" levels when the game was more open world, and then pared down when it was cut up into a linear shooter.

- There is an interview with Ken Levine, Shantytown is back in the release build. Likely this was done to fit the new narrative.

There are several instances in the course of the game which, but which make very little sense when the whole cloth is examined.

When it comes down to it, it's clear that they cut out the vast majority of what had made Infinite unique, and replaced it with a severely reduced linear shooter.

It is a testament to Irrational that they were able to pull together a very enjoyable product in what appears to be a very short span of time

This may be an odd choice, bows, knights.  The first person view really helped to make it an immersive experience (first time I ever swung a sword in first person mode.)  The levels were fantastic.  There were so many possible paths, I don't think I ever explored them all.  (Constantine's Mansion, anyone?)  It was my first introduction to Steampunk, which apparently I liked before it was cool.

When I was going through Hitman, I was like, ""Yes. I will do that."" I didn't. If a part was too hard I would just run and gun my way to the next part. I was playing on a difficulty that was way to high for me, all because there was an achievement for doing so.

The reason I got rid of Rage two weeks after picking it up, and I would have to go through an entire building with no save points every time it killed me. Because of an achievement.

I went through Borderlands 1 again

My friend Frank thinks that achievements are being misused by developers.

It isn't that.

That may be a valid concern
I just have to get them. Achievements

I have to get the achievements
I know everything that's going to happen

The only reason I can still play Fallout New Vegas is because I still have specific things that I need to do! Finish the game with Yes Man, complete Lonesome Road that came out two fucking years ago!

I couldn't even play RED DEAD FUCKING REDEMPTION

It's why I liked WoW so much. Everything was a goddamned achievement. 

You cleared this dungeon for the first time?

Here's an achievement!

You have this certain level of a profession?

Here's an achievement!

You have this many pets?

Here's a fucking achievement!

I can't enjoy a game unless it's the first time I'm playing it

I don't know what's wrong with me. I don't know how to have fun anymore.

My friend Frank from before suggested that I put the Xbox aside for a little bit and go back to a time before Achievements; that I should start playing around with a console from before that time

But achievements are only a part of the problem. A major contributor, then I don't know what to do. All those old game are just ""Go here do this"" ""Go there do that"" It's the same but with no room for experimentation.

Zelda games, take the shit, fight the boss, you win. The only thing that changes is how much health you have and what stuff you use. The game is always the same. I beat it once, the game is done. I can't play it anymore.

I tried to wander around in Fallout 3. Just to go exploring

I started in Megaton. Nothing but Combat Armor, the repellent stick because I had just started that quest for Moira, and Dogmeat. I left the town and decided to head southwest. I walked until I found some city ruins.

I wandered over to a map marker and it continued farther than the door I had found

I ran back inside

Kept walking

Then I just shut off my Xbox. Not out of rage

This is happening with every single game I play! Borderlands 2, Red Dead, Skyrim! Every single game I have put in, I only play for a half hour at the most, then I just turn it off and look for something else to do.

I had found 30 dollars a couple days ago

I just get bored and go look to do something else. But I have nothing else to do! I started going through the games I bought on Steam and had never played.

I started playing Lone Survivor today

I think MMO's might have ruined other games for me. I would think that not playing them anymore would be an easy cure, and I'm playing a little f2p swtor, but that's only with my friend Courtland, so I think it's alright for me.

I was discussing all of this with Frank, Sanctum, stuff like that.

But

That's why I'm so eager to spend what little money I have on new games. Because it's something new that I can play and don't have to worry about getting bored with it

I started immediately in Multiplayer and sunk hundreds of hours having long, twitch the mouse in the direction you wish to swing, and left click. For blocking, twich the mouse in the direction of the incoming blow and right click. It's a very reflex intensive game where you're frantically trying to block attacks and deliver your own. There are tons of weapons: Axes, swords, maces, polearms, crossbows

I recently got into singleplayer and I was just floored by how deep it was. You start as one man on the world map.. you pick your faction and work your way up by recruiting peasants from taverns and ranking them up through field combat. you get money through trading, taking enemy generals as prisoners and waiting for a ransom and many other ways. You can take a castle for yourself, defect from your chosen faction and start your own and become the King. There's castle seiges, romance (you can woo a lady and build up your relationship with her, and eventually marry her), politics.. There are several vassals per faction and you can have independent relationship levels with each one.. 

Really, it'd even be worth it if the game was $59.99. with some tweaking, it runs great on lower end machines. It's not the most beautiful looking game but it's not bad looking. Truthfully, i'll take semi-good looking graphics and 200 v 200 man fights over cutting edge graphics and lagging out with that many units.

In this game I had probably my most badass online gaming moment ever.. 100 vs 100. Long fight

So

tl:dr - Mount and Blade: Warband, it is definitely an A+ game. Kick ass multiplayer with up to 100 vs 100 (biggest server I saw) with single player battles being as big as 200 vs. 200. It has a deep ""conquer the world"" singleplayer that has too many awesome features to count. Play it!

I will do this comparison on 2 different categories- Gameplay (both RPG and FPS elements are included here) and Atmosphere (which includes the story

*Gameplay- Well there isn't much to compare here. Both had very solid RPG, but I think this just make it a better FPS, and seeing how it's an FPS-RPG, I don't see the problem with making it easier to aim.
There is also the redundant Hardcore mode, eat and sleep once in 3 days or so (anything past that meant death. Anything before, however, meant pretty much nothing).
So NV's gameplay is kind of the same

*Atmosphere- Here the games truly are different. The atmosphere, while the main theme of NV is just politics. Yes, there are politics in Fallout 3 (the BoS-Enclave war), but they too center around survival- control over water supplies. In NV, they center around control, period- whoever controls the Hoover Dam controls the Mojave Wasteland and it's inhabitants, but there is still enough un-irradiated to go around

This is why I like Fallout 3 more. Many people complained that it's too depressing, the green skies and the murky water. In Fallout 3 you feel the hardships of everyone around you, you see that they need help. That's where the main story comes in- your initial mission is to find your dad, but after that it's to give clean water to everyone, to help the **Survive**. In NV you don't get that feel.

1325460986.0,nz2jj,A Tale of Three Games: How support and multiplayer UI can make or break multiplayer communities,Drinniol,196,36,90,"The topic of this post is one near and dear to my heart. It deals with three fairly recent RTS games: Red Alert 3

Red Alert 3:

While unjustly maligned by some, an excellent in game UI , a diverse and fun cast of units, and an excellent division of micro and macro. To elaborate on the last two points, every unit in RA3 had an ability. No unit was an ordinary, boring point and click, and no unit was a frustrating caster with 4 or 5 different spells. Also, the use of a single resource and a single worker per expansion meant that you did not have to mindlessly build up workers for the entire game. The net effect at upper levels of play was an incredibly dynamic, but these could have been ironed out.

Yet they were not. The support for RA3 has been dismal. Game breaking exploits are rife and are not fixed. Imbalanced strategies are found and never patched. And this is not even the most frustrating part of the RA3 online experience.

No

   1. You have to leave the game and go to another website to initially sign up for multiplayer.
   2. Custom games list is populated based on the random chat channel you are placed into at login.
   3. A near total lack of useful chat commands and features.
   4. Automated matchmaking has few options and is quite bad.

Basically, but then decided to wear socks and sandals. And without even matching socks. Basically, it made the game a chore to play, and is the primary reason I and many other gave up RA3 early despite its promise. It is entirely unacceptable that RA3's multiplayer browser did not even reach feature parity with RA2's! The fundamental message here is that you CANNOT and MUST NOT market out your multiplayer browser to a third party! It is the means by which your game's players will interact with the game every day. Many players will spend as much or more time in it as they will playing the game itself! It is absolutely vital that the integration be well thought out and seamless.

Dawn of War 2:

Dawn of War 2 is near and dear to my heart. I was one of the best DoW2 players in the world

This is what multiplayer DoW2 could have been: A game taking the innovative gameplay, which is why having the multiplayer be focused on small squad based micro battles was a travesty.

Yet I still loved the game for what it was and played it faithfully for years. Still

First, and mechanics are complicated and hidden. The game is filled with odd bugs and idiosyncrasies, such as certain buffs stacking in odd ways to give unintuitive results. Many of these problems have been known since release, and have, in fact, been addressed numerous times by third party modders. Yet Relic, the makers of the game

Also

But the third and most damaging error is the same as that made in RA3: Relic farmed out one of the most important parts of their game, this was Games for Windows Live. GFWL dealt a crippling blow to in-game fun and community. For instance, if you wanted to message someone to play, you had to go into a separate, stark white GFWL interface and essentially send them a pseudoemail. Even when it worked, it was slow and aggravating. It also meant that Relic couldn't patch their own game without coordinating with Microsoft. It drove off droves of players for years before Relic finally had had enough.

With the advent of the Retribution expansion, buggy, and frustrating because it is an ungracious attempt to marry two entirely different systems. You can't, for instance, invite someone in game to your game without first adding them as a friend through the steam friends UI. Thus every attempt at arranging a match is circuitous and frustrating. Furthermore, when Steam servers go down for maintenance (frequently), every single person's current game is ended and they cannot make a new one. This makes no sense at all since the games are played P2P

Today the DoW2 multiplayer scene is largely dead and almost entirely unsupported except for the occasional cash grab cosmetic DLC. A sad state of affairs for a game that might have combined the illustrious legacies of both the DoW and CoH series.

Starcraft 2: Starcraft 2, and overall found the game to be far, far too similar to Brood War.

That is, from certain design standpoints I thought the game was a step backward. Various nuanced and interesting units were replaced with far more boring and straightforward ones (reavers vs collosi). A number of interesting unit interactions were wiped out with no real replacements, and the focus on the macro game was taken to a ridiculous extreme.

And yet SC2 is a great success, SC2 is really the only game in town.

Why? Because Blizzard has supported its game excellently. When exploits are found, casting, and replay tools are absolutely unmatched. Their community interaction both online and through live events is similarly unparalleled.

In short, on the other hand, had a few strong innovations drowned in a glut of minor shortcomings. In the end, when I want to cut down a tree I will take a honed and sturdy axe over a rusted and ungassed chainsaw.

tl;dr RA3 and DoW2 had a number of innovations and great ideas, on the other hand, has grown and continues to grow prodigiously despite containing few gameplay innovations because of strong and sustained developer support.

[This entire scene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p3GkA4Fm5-s&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;amp;t=6m17s) is one of my all time favorite dialogue trees in any video game I've ever played. All the different possibilities of how that conversation can pan out is pretty impressive.

Games with exemplary dialogue trees off the top of my head are the Planescape: Torment, Telltale's The Walking Dead game, Alpha Protocol had some really good dialogue trees too.

Anyway back to Fallout 1 &amp;amp; 2. The first time I realized how powerful dialogue trees can be in video games is when I rescued Tandi from the Raiders without resorting to violence.

1359583646.0,17l67a,Pre-CU SWG vs EVE economy,taroth,205,46,103,"I know there must be some thoughtful Pre-CU (a game-altering patch) Star Wars Galaxies vets and EVE players on this subreddit. I was hoping we might engage in a discussion of **what makes the economies of these two very different games so amazing and how they compare to each other**. I'll start with a summary of why I think the Pre-CU SWG economy was fantastic:


**Players from the ground up**

In SWG, and components that would be used in item creation. Rare, powerful creatures would drop rare, powerful item components (sometimes leading to server-famous weapons!). Acting as a solo player was totally viable as buying items from other players was easy and transparent.

**Item diversity**

Every resource (and item component) in the game was given a set of ""characteristics"" with random values between 1 and 1000. For example, and 800 conductivity. These characteristics would determine the quality of the item produced. The crafting system allowed for something called ""experimentation"" allowing crafters to risk their crafting materials to produce a potentially amazing item or fail miserably. The best crafters on the server were those who acquired clothing that allowed for even riskier experimentation and had access to the best materials. Every item was unique, and the crafter's name was inscribed on the item.

**Industry**

When a powerful item was produced

**Resource competition** 

Resources would spawn every two weeks or so with an entirely new set of characteristic values. When a rich spawn was scouted (there were players who did exclusively this)

**Endless demand**

All items suffered permanent decay. Meaning that no matter how powerful the item you produced, every server economy suffered massive inflation and nearly crumbled. Item decay kept SWG's economic wheels turning. Players were always on the lookout for good spawns and powerful item component drops.

**Trading opportunities**

Ambitious players established player cities, so sophisticated trade was done through non-anonymous trades. Traders would make fortunes by buying materials at low prices on outer rim worlds from miners or their NPCs then selling them to crafters in the inner rim.

**Player interdependence**

The last point I'll leave on, which means I played the role of infusing combat players with ""buffs"" so they could fight the toughest monsters. Players would pay me 22k credits a pop for my buffs, and often I would have repeat customers who knew me and tipped me extra. Instead of crafting my own buffs, I bought the consumable from a doctor that focused on high-quality blue print production and manufacturing. He stocked his factories with materials from an Artisan who focused on extracting the best resources. The Artisan had a few Scout buddies who found the top current spawns. The Scouts bought their buffs from me. Every player existed in dozens of these economic loops, whether they realized it consciously or not. Servers were medium sized (10,000 players per server) so everyone knew of and was connected to each other in some shape or form (""Oh you're the guy who makes rare carbines for the Rebels, cool!""). What came through was the feeling of being immersed in a living

However it made me wonder

Does the simplicity of the visual make it easier for us to process the sprite and thus enjoy whatever it does a bit more?  Perhaps especially when it forces us to engage our imagination to fill in the rest of the design.  It sort of reminds me of art especially when it came down to minimalism and impressionism where had there been a more detailed or complicated representation of the subjects

1335149683.0,snksf,Sniper Elite V2 and the state of sniping in shooters,Buckshot9044,188,34,104,"So many of you have probably played the demo of this game that is coming out soon and I just finished my 10th play through of it and I have to say I am blown away by just the demo of this game.

As we all know sniping has evolved in gaming into almost the exact opposite of what it really is in the real world. I am not saying that this is a bad thing but it has happened. In most FPS games ie. Call of Duty

I have always been a fan of shooters and sniping

Other sniping games have come out and they have been more or less flops such as Sniper: Ghost Warrior. In an honest opinion a ""true"" sniping video game would not be fun to play because that would be someone sitting at their screen for hours to days on end killing very few individuals and would probably be too hard to actually play for the common person. 

What I feel this game does is find that very nice balance of sniping mechanics and well paced action. What i mean by sniping mechanics are the things that make you feel like you are sniping, especially the wind. Games like Battlefield3 have bullet drop but don't account for wind. Second is the heart rate mechanic and how it works. In most other games you can sprint full speed, stop, hold your breath and head shot all day, rinse repeat. This game when you sprint and run around your heart rate increases to either reduce time spent holding breath and increasing scope drift, or if you run to much, disables the ability to hold your breath until you rest and calm down. I think that this is such a small

The cover mechanic works well allowing for stealth and strategy to come into play. Being able to survey the area and set up the shots you need

The slow motion kill shots I personally think are great and they seem to trigger the right amount, only for the camera to quickly zoom back out and all you can see is the smoke from the explosion.

- **Taking control away from the player** - I don't mean cutscenes. I'm totally fine with those. I'm talking about games that deliberately take control away from the player in times where it's needed. By far the biggest offender here is Lost Planet, you get knocked over. The amount of time it takes you to get up is absurd, and by that time you're being shot with another rocket. This all too often ends with the player being shot until they die. Total dealbreaker - could not play that game anymore. In Dead Rising, it's the same kind of thing - zombies and bosses grab you and knock you over so constantly that you feel like the game is just stealing health from you rather than you're not skilled enough at it.

- **Difficulty spikes** - Sometimes I tolerate these just fine. Prototype is a good example - it became really hard at times, is Deus Ex: Human Revolution's boss fights. That game's bosses are not only unfair, they're poorly designed, not taking into account what kind of character the player has. I went full on stealth and didn't outfit myself with shock resistance at all - so the second boss that shocks the floor? Near impossible to defeat. I had to exploit a glitch where she froze in place and shoot her in the face with a shotgun over 2 dozen times. Unbelievable.

- **Poorly placed or non-existent checkpoints** - Dead Rising. Dead Rising. Dead Rising. Rarely does a game so utterly fail at this like Dead Rising and its fun but lazy sequel. It doesn't even restart you at the beginning of boss fights when you die - instead you have to fight your way back to them. Not fun at all.

I've been playing MP games on Steam for a while and found it tolerable, I don't understand why it's becoming the norm for single player games, nor why most players accept it. For SP games, Steam makes you bear with all its drawbacks while offering no real advantage in return, neither to developers (it's ineffective, as it's common knowledge that all offline-only big releases are hacked fully within a week) nor to players, as the social features that make Steam convenient for arranging and enjoying MP games are much less useful in SP.

1. A draconian EULA that allows Valve to shut down access to all your games for no reason whatsoever. In addition you lose all rights to a fair trial and have to resort to whatever arbitration procedure they choose if you have a problem with them. I'm sure this wouldn't hold in any European court of law

2. You have to be online to activate and download the game

3. Their official support is on the level of ATI/AMD: emails get ignored and support tickets get late and canned replies, and there's not much they can do if your account gets locked.

4. Can't sell, as it's locked to your account for all eternity.

4. Automatic patch downloading. I always liked to play the game and then download any patches once I'm done

5. You can't choose where to install the games without 3rd party tools

5. It's an extra point of failure. If for whatever reason Steam refuses to work

6. Steam knows your PC specs, what you've been playing and for how long. While I trust Valve, there's no reason why I should have to give any information at all to any company just to play an offline game. Oh, and they got hacked.

For many years I played games until something else made me stop — I had to walk the dog, my progress in the game was right in the middle of a quest or challenge. Worse, sometimes I would stop playing whilst trying to overcome a really difficult level or puzzle. (I'm looking at you, *Super Meat Boy*.)

Recently I've come to realize that this pattern is the number one reason why I would abandon a game completely. (And sometimes feel like video games themselves are unappealing.) Why? Because whenever I consider that game

* ""You're in the middle of a boring section. All the fun and excitement of that game are gone."" 

or

* ""NO! That game brings pain! It's aggravating and you get really mad. Remember when you hurt your hand because you punched the wall after failing for the 739th time? Play something else!""

To rid myself of these thoughts

Take *Hotline Miami*. It's tempting to just keep going after I finish a level. But chances are I will eventually reach a difficult bit and run out of time before I can conquer it. Instead

Now when I consider a game

Could this mechanic be adopted by shooters, could we see community graded endings that run in seasons? Of course not 5 or 6, but an ODST type game where the ending is based on how many of your units survive?

If none of you make it, but you perish in the act? If most of your squad survives, you only lose a player or two in the ending act, and you go home to be lauded as heroes. This could even lead to a branching storyline where you can play different episodic content.

What if that's too hard for the casual gamer? Of course it would be, a new troop of ODSTS drops, and sticks with you, and you take control of them as you go?

I recently went back to Skyrim for a bit, but that's beside the point). Now, as we all know, TES gives people the general freedom to do pretty much whatever they want. If you want to be evil and kill everyone, fine. If you want to complete the main quests because you're into narrative, great. If you want to grind at leveling up your smithing or magic powers so that you can craft better items or use better spells, go for it. All in all, but that's considered one of it's strong suits

I put 60 hours into Skyrim, generally avoiding cities and people, and just appreciating the natural beauty provided by the game-world. Friends are always surprised to see how low of a level I am, but it's not like I'm really aiming for anything in particular; I haven't completed any main storylines, and really didn't aim for anything in particular in that game. I just went to that game to wander and be alone.

In what little I've played of Minecraft, digging tunnels occasionally, but really so that I can explore underground. These open-world games for me aren't really telling me to do anything, so I just go off and be alone. I'm an introverted person, so that's reflected in how I play these games.

Games like Mass Effect are also considered great for the variety of choice they give you, but choice and freedom are two different things (in the context of this subject). Choice is being able to choose one of several outcomes to a situation; freedom is being able to tackle the situation in any way you want. Mass Effect often presented the player with some heavy dilemmas, but in the end, your options were limited to what they give.

1337794642.0,u1alg,"It took me about 2 weeks to make, an app that retrieves every steam game, dlc, bundle offered. A little look into how steam works.",sevenalive,65, but I wanted to give an in-depth look. Screenshots are at the bottom.

It's rare to find anything on the Steam CDR, it lists everything, and I mean everything. Language packs, demos, trailers, guides, content depots, searching steam cdr got me nowhere. I got the feeling it was some secret underground thing that is used to pirate steam games

I am aware of some sites that host the raw CDR

Now I hit quite a few problems making this app. The CDR is filled with IDs, it's just the information steam needs to download and run.

The CDR is split into 2 sections, but they are a bundle of more than 1 app. I believe they are also tied to MMO subscriptions, but I can't say for sure.

The CDR is actually on everybody's steam installation. It's inside the ClientRegistry.blob, I thought they pulled it from the steam store.

So my app reads that and loops through all the apps and subs. The first thing I do is check to see if my own database already has that record, trailer, or that has regional tags like (FR) or (PEGI).

Once I got that that, which I construct with the ID's given to me in the CDR. apps are /app/123456 and subs are sub/123456

First I create myself a cookie that says I am over 18

I also throw away stuff that isn't available in my region (U.S), check if it's a DLC item, check if it's free to play. I also check and see if that app can be bought individually on steam. For example, Breath of Fire &amp; Chutulu Saves the World VII is only sold in the pack, but they both have app store pages. For my purposes I don't care about those pages anyway, I only want the stuff you can buy and play.

There is also another issue of [false sub pages](http://store.steampowered.com/sub/70)

Alright so once I got all of the bad stuff out of the way, since I already got them earlier with the apps. But I do check the price for each app in the bundle, because I need to calculate how many points it is worth for what I am doing. I don't count anything less than $1 or anything that you can't buy separately. The sub pages list those items as N/A, meaning you have to buy the pack if you want that game. Since I throw out the false app pages, it helps make sure the points I am calculating are accurate.

So once I got all my info for that ID, the app only needs to do that when it doesn't have it's database. So after the first run, it just continues along the loop for everything I already have. I only need to go to the steam page if it's something I don't know about. So it allows for fast and easy updates to the data for when new games are added.

Besides filtering and saving the useful data, I can't make it open source. I could distribute a prefilled database with the app, but if some people decide to delete it and have it run from scratch, that is a big problem. 1 person doing it is fine, 10 is fine, but not 500+ people doing it. That would be a bad situation and that is why reddit bans abusive bots, they can bring down a site. There wouldn't be any reason I can think of to delete the database. I have the ability to exclude, see if it still exists

What I can do is import the information into a public spreadsheet, since 99% of people won't need it, but the %.0001 percent of them will need it badly enough to pay for it.

**TL;DR:** I made an app that parses the CDR, checks the type of item and stores the information. It is the most complete list of games, dlc, and bundles you can buy on steam.

It's not something I wrote on a blog and am posting here. It's a discussion I've been thinking about for a long time. I want input

Older gamers tend to look down on newer ones when they don't enjoy the games they themselves grew up with. Why?

I'm going to go out on a limb and say it. Some old games are inferior. Like physically just inferior. The UI and controls are counter-intuitive, etc. That's just a thing. Comparing Warcraft 1 to Warcraft 3 is mind-blowing in the UI and control department.

Yet when a gamer doesn't play those older games or doesn't enjoy them

But why do we do this? Why do we feel the need to ostracize those that don't want to go back and wrestle with a game to make it work? Why are they suddenly terrible people for enjoying the experience of booting up a game and having it just WORK

This has been confusing me for some time, and the experience that the second one provides. Yet I have gotten into arguments with people on this subreddit who say that the first is better because. Because why? Because when you were 9 and the game came out it was so good and you relive that magic every time you play it now? That's not a reason.

Battlefield: Bad Company 2 also had a progression system. In that case however

As most of us know especially the vehicle unlocks in BF3 are built in a way that the more you unlock the better you are. Flares on jets are a great example. You're useless without them, everyone. I even recognise such behaviour in myself!



Having realized this I looked back at my brief time playing MW2 and noticed how dominant the individual centered playstyle was there. I personally never cared for how well our team does. Only my K/D and how much closer I was to the next unlock mattered.

1348960512.0,10orek,Motion compared to graphics. How motion can make the difference.,carpeggio,200,55,75,"[The images that sparked this.](http://imgur.com/a/vjrfk) It's screenshots of Battlefield 2 (2005) and Battlefield 3 (Late 2011.)

I find screenshots NEVER do video game GRAPHICS justice nowadays. They do art concept and style justice a majority of the time. How the scene moves and reacts and how we interact with it is what I call graphics. Pictures at MOST will show stylistic features and stand-still quality. I'd say everything working together visually is a ""graphics"" definition. These pictures represent everything stylistic about the comparison.

Showing these comparisons to a non-gamer they might see some differences. For the most part they will decide the skill of the capture is better in the BF3 because of the more accurate representation of shadow and detail. It might be a little disconcerting to see how they remark that they are pretty similar. Considering time has past and technology has improved between BF2 and BF3. One would expect that the difference would be larger. The missing link to reach this conclusion is motion.

As soon as jets do low fly-by's and explosions start going off, but also the physics engine of being able to blow up shacks and panels that gave motion resolution. Things now need to be set in motion beautifully.

I feel like I'm making a comment in the early 2000's. Screenshots no longer give any game justice. In order for a game to be taken seriously graphically

So how do you move art style and visual representation into the motion category of a game? More importantly, and gritty. As you would expect from a fast-paced war game. Skyrims motion is held in a faw wider scope. It's a full experience adventure game where you experience battle pace and leisure pace. So the motion of your environment has to be varied.

I think even with room for improvement in the graphical category of visual gaming, ""It's a living breathing world."" Which refer to the subtle elements of motion (like a chest moving up and down while breathing) that ultimately make a huge statement on the status of the world, and give it credibility. 

Maybe motion is a sum of it's parts with a few extra tricks. Or maybe it's not. I feel though

I remember in an interview, when snake had to knock out Meryl, the player had to knock out Meryl. The story also kept the player and Snake in sync. That's why that game was so great.

1 - The Publisher system

Basically

There are enormous pressures to reach completely unrealistic review targets which, say, the best movies of the past decade and the metacritic ratings for games which were seen as mediocre at best for a quick and dirty overview), including financial pressures.

There is also an incredible amount of immaturity from publishers: when a movie receives a bad review

Finally, no opera premiere worth its salt bans critics, when a movie doesn't have critical screening it's a good indication that even the makers know it sucks. On the opposite end you get NDAs, and employees reviewing themselves and sinking reviews of other groups (EA is getting infamous for this), and corporate secrecy to a ridiculous extent, and what should be a time for criticism is often treated as an excuse to treat reviewers to ridiculous corporate parties and other such nonsense. If a movie director decided to dine and wine a bunch of critics just before a premiere, and only critics

2 - Reviewers

That one sounds incredibly bitchy but I consider it wholly deserved. Most videogame reviewers show an incredible lack of culture

This leads to nonsense like Bioshock Infinite being compared to Citizen Kane

There is also an expectation of reviewers to give high reviews, give out relatively honest reviews compared to game publishing. There's also the matter of intellectual independence; it's not just a matter of having the guts to do critique, it's also a matter of rampant fanboyism, which dependence on advertisement revenue simply exacerbates. Most art reviewers have this independence because they work for newspapers and because art critique is a very old, very established part of art in the first place. An artist who doesn't take criticism well is an artist who doesn't grow. Despite the old saw, not all art critiques are completely unaware of what they're critiquing, in fact most probably have some semblance of art education.

I don't expect reviewers to be able to quote Adorno in untranslated german or to namedrop McLuhan and Zizek every third sentence

And finally, Tim Cain, Josh Sawyer: these are creators. Obsidian Entertainment: this is a company. That attitude, which I forgot to mention in part 1, is also part of the problem in treating a videogame as art. If a game is to be treated as little else than a factory product behind the scenes with coders who do assembly line writing, then making art out of this requires sysyphean efforts.

3 - The Fandom

Yes

Videogame fans, in addition to displaying the same issues as reviewers. They form a second type of pressure on reviewers in that a bad review of something they like will tend to ruffle feathers. Sometimes there are bad things, and people like bad things. It's called guilty pleasures, there's nothing wrong with it, but someone liking it doesn't make it ""The Portrait of Dorian Grey"". 

Accusations of ripping off are, and this ridiculous copyright culture we have these days obscures a major fact of human cultures: there is no new story, there is no original story, they've all been told, it's just how you tell it and what you do with the fucking archetypes.

But they way these mechanics are implemented are usually wrong in my mind. Usually the locks are skill based, while higher levels are harder, and only become accessible when you have the appropriate skill level. I feel that you shouldn't be punished by the game if you choose not to develop  skills that would allow you to attain the information. 

My proposition is to keep the difficulty level of locks and terminals but get rid of the necessary amount of skill to unlock the hardest ones. instead, the harder locks become easier and easier. This way gamers don't feel left out if they choose not to specialize in this task, but they still get the same experience, just with a greater challenge.

EDIT: A lot of people have pointed out that my Idea would make (lets just call it ""lockpick skill"") adding skill points to an ability pointless since with enough time and effort a player could get past any difficulty.

---

To start things off myself:

**Invasions**:

For a PvE player like myself, barely hanging on and xXxR4ng3rKn1ght420xXx steps up and backstabs you, and you are now potentially out of X humanity and (in my most recent case) ~40.000 souls. Focus on the invader and the regular monsters will kill you. As any PvP player will tell you, the soul level limit does very little to keep fights balanced when players can make dedicated PvP characters and transfer high-level gear to them.

Of course, and this is usually how players justify this design. 
I would agree if it were not for this one thing: *You can't avoid being human quite regularly.* There is no way to kindle bonfires without that. 
When do you kindle bonfires? *When you've just arrived in an area and are having a hard time

The design choice to link activating/upgrading a save point and opening yourself up to PvP is a nonsensical one, brutal and honest, being randomly assassinated by overleveled players is a bad fit.

**Weapon hits/collisions**:

Why is it that my uchi gets stuck on a wall when I slash more or less parallel to it, but there are instances in the game where a fight is uncharacteristically hard because you are hindered by your surroundings while your opponents are not. This is pretty much the sole reason I stopped using greatswords - it is simply too common to get into areas where you can't even swing them properly. Getting hit by a dagger through a massive column is not good game design no matter how you spin it, and it seems more like an oversight or laziness on the developer's part than anything that can be justified as a conscious design choice.

There are other instances where the weapon hit detection is a bit dodgy. Getting hit by the slow-moving blunt rear-end of a spear

If this were the first game in the series I would be understanding of these errors. However, what could possibly justify it? I am at a loss.

**Blighttown**

This area isn't actually all that difficult combat wise. It's just bloody annoying. The level design has you walking across all kinds of rickety structures, you're just messing with players. You're more or less forcing a bunch of random deaths caused by unpredictable/unavoidable knockbacks (depending on player build and loadout. For a shield+sword player, or heavy armor player this is hell. Dodge-based characters will have a hard time as well, but at least it's in their own hands whether they dodge off a bridge or not.)

Then there's the fact that you *will* get poisoned going through the swamp no matter how high your poison resistance is and there is no merchant in the area. In order to get through Quelaag, buy a ton of moss clumps and get back in. Complete time sink for very little (if any) gain in gameplay quality.

**TL;DR: If you had to explain some of Dark Soul's oddities and were forbidden to use ""it's unforgiving"" as an argument

*Edit

**The design of the primordial serpents**
I realize this one is a bit more of a subjective thing, I'm not sure which intern got tasked with designing these.

**Unreliable triggers**
In a game where experimentation and trial-and-error is encouraged so much, glitching or otherwise triggering an event ""wrong"". 
Examples: 

- Fall down Frampt's pit before talking to him and place the Lordvessel? Both Frampt and Kaathe will now assume you picked the other one
- Siegmeyer can get glitched and not show up in Anor Londo, then talk to Siegmeyer again and he will possibly be fixed. I've heard mixed reports about whether this actually works. Already beat O&amp;S? Byebye Siegmeyer storyline.
- Being able to kill Gwynevere in Anor Londo without triggering the results

**Controls oddities**
You almost never use a ranged weapon when you are in lock-on range. So, do you need to explicitly exit this zoom mode before you can swap your weapon to a different one? Dodge doesn't work, running doesn't work, estus doesn't work, nothing works. Only LB1 and RB1. See an enemy coming up to attack and want to get your shield out and block? LB1, d-pad away from bow, LB1. A bit weird.

Ever since The Binding of Isaac was released and became a big hit last year, as he preferred to let fans speculate and give the game their own meaning. But after the release of The Basement Collection (A re-release of McMillen's previous work), one fan has been able to piece together not only the true meaning behind The Binding of Isaac, but also identify the over-arcing theme of several games from McMillen's long game-dev career. McMillen confirmed the accuracy of this article[ on his blog](http://edmundm.com/post/32717083908/the-chest-is-open).

But many people are still unfamiliar with Edmund McMillen's games, but I had no idea how deep the meaning was until reading this article. So I thought it was worth sharing here as well.

------

**To those of you unfamiliar with The Binding of Isaac:**

TBOI is a rogue-like created by Edmund McMillen (known from Super Meat Boy and Indie Game: The Movie). You play as the character Isaac, similar to how Super Meat Boy was inspired by the platforming in Mario. Each time you play through the game, the items you unlock, the levels you explore, what bosses you encounter and so on is all randomized, in an attempt to create an infinitely replayable game. Similarly to the dungeons in Zelda, at each level (or floor) you will find a lot of rooms with monsters, and you advance to the next level by defeating the level's boss.

1. As my first example I can mention Guild Wars 2. For you that haven't heard, weapon skin swapper, summonable banker, xp boosts, etc. Nothing really game changing, mostly decoration and convenience items (levels dont matter for pvp, they are barely noticeable in pve).

2. The next game is the one that started this discussion - Eve Online. Again

3. The arguments that my friends presented (we are all, you get power. In GW2 that means you can buy better items, better armor, crafting ingredients. In Eve Online you can buy huge ships and modules for them, increasing corporation or alliance assets. By buying and selling enough PLEXes, you could theoretically 'equip' your whole alliance with the strongest fleet possible and conquer the whole universe. They used a story (which might be a rumor or a lie, since nobody between has had a first hand experience with that) in which one russian CEO (leader) sold tens of thousands of dollars worth PLEXes on the ingame market, this might not be true (I don't even have any names)


4. My arguments were that all of these things are possible by not using RL cash. Although it is practically impossible, there still had to be players willing to give ISK to buy these PLEXes (there's always plenty of that, eve market is huge), and enough ISK in the whole game to begin with. They also don't get any ships that wouldn't be accessible to other players, they just have a much bigger number of them.

5. In GW2 a similar argument can be made. Cash shop doesn't influence pvp at all - in pvp you automatically get max stat equipment and max level. In pve there are no gem-exclusive items at all


So basically, it is ""paying to win"". If you guys didn't play any of these games, I imagine there are many more examples which you can use, I chose these 2 since I feel most familiar with them.

With the recent trend of In-app purchases

-The natural form of progression is very limited

-The odds are not in your favor

-Advancing through certain aspects of the game would take forever because the game mechanics have a handicap for those that do not make a monetary

Because of this, you need to do x"" where x can be pay money, gain experience, complete a mission, etc.

Developers have now oversimplified this by saying ""pay x (REAL money), because I'm going outside of the realm of the game now, and using real money to receive a (usually exaggerated) gain.
The result is you have a game where you would normally work hard to progress and get a sense of accomplishment

TL;DR: For me
 
  
 
EDIT: An important point I made which I want people to understand is- the fact alone that a game has IAP's will change the entire game dynamic than if it didn't have IAP's. Developers will make the goal of a certain game event more tedious (i.e. huge level of grinding), the game dynamics incentive changes, and as a result, that game event would be completely different, and wouldn't be so boring/tedious. So when you think about it, **a developer has an incentive to make certain game events boring/tedious, etc. in order to offer a appealing IAP.** This is not my opinion, but almost all do.

* 1. **Different racquets should give different attribute bonuses.** This is a no-brainer. Different racquets have different advantages/disadvantages IN REAL LIFE. For example, but my accuracy and feel at the net will suffer. Conversely, a 90 sq inch racquet, like the Wilson Pro Staff 90, will give me better feel and accuracy but at the expense of power and spin. Every single racquet is different and one may be excellent for one player but crap for another. This is some true video game style shit and *it's real life.* Seriously, this is some very rich video game territory and there's no reason it shouldn't be incorporated into the biggest tennis video game franchise. Mario Tennis for the Game Boy Color did this quite well and it wasn't just some video game bullshit forced upon the player (like the shoes in NBA 2K series or the skates and sticks in EA's NHL series)...real racquets have different attributes for real players in real life. This is a situation where you can incorporate a popular video game trope while actually *adding to* the realism. What a rare and wonderful opportunity!
* 2. **Customizable racquets** This is building off the first suggestion, while depolarizing the weight (putting a lot of the weight at the very top and very bottom) makes it less consistent but gives it more extreme spin and power potential. This combined with the previous and next suggestion give some very good possibilities for a tennis video game. Again, this seems like a system perfectly suited to the video game crowd.

Essentially, you have a list of priorities your character will follow, and in each slot you list a condition and an action to take when that condition is met.

For example

Battles would take place watching your squad of 5 characters fight an enemy's squad using the predetermined AI you each setup before the fight with very minimal interaction by the players.  After a fight ends

1. First, around the 8th or so my blows were mostly bouncing off the stump instead of doing any damage as the first eight did; I reached the conclusion that any MMO/RPG mechanic aiming for immersion and realism needs to decrease attacking strength, speed and recovery in some manner with Stamina.

2. Then, and around 25 before they stopped doing damage. From this, I learned that a weapon's size shouldn't determine outright if it is 1h or 2h, but if the character in question has the strength to wield the weapon in a 2h way; further, stamina (and by proxy, strength and speed) should decrease slower for a two-handed user.

Also during the 2h test

3. I held another object of a similar weight and shape while beating the poor tree up. Let's just say there weren't any advantages. I was double-tired double-fast and the tree could be said to have won that round. I just don't think ""dual wielding"" a sword can work out.

&gt; ... just like you did in classic titles like System Shock or Deus Ex. Don't worry if you're not hardcore enough to have fond memories of that era

Then it popped in my head... apart from very specific examples like Deus Ex, where every single thing you do drastically affects the outcome of the game.

Let's roll back shall we? The late '90s gave us Duke Nukem 3D, Medal of Honor, Tribes, Counter Strike, Unreal Tournament and like two other Quake games. This is only on the PC mind you because the console FPS scene at the time was negligible with obvious exemptions made for Goldeneye and Turok. Hell even Rainbow Six and Mechwarrior were tactical games but gave us enough ammo to finish a mission.

So what's this so-called ""Mode 1999"" a flashback to? Deus Ex wasn't even released until 2000 (2001?). So it should just be called ""System Shock"" mode

But by calling it ""1999 Mode"" it's preyed on the fake-hardcore

Side note: spoilers below.  Be warned.

One

Secondly, when you want.  But it's very direct in telling you what you *can* do.  Many, if not all, decisions are made for the player.  In the Companions questline, you have no choice against becoming a werewolfspoiler.  In order to complete the questline, you *have to*.  But coming into the questline, you have no intentions of this.  You simply intend to kill shit.  The developers are forcing a moral code on your character.  And the few times that you do have to make a choice (i.e. destroying the Dark Brotherhood instead of joining it), for example

Anyways, Tactical Freedom, and Narrative Freedom.

Exploratory Freedom is what Skyrim is known for--the ability to do whatever you want, or do you want to head back out and go hunt some deer?  Do you want to capture an outpost, or do you want to go fly a jet into some random citizen's face?  Exploratory Freedom is all about giving the player a set of tools, and letting them do whatever they want with them.

Tactical Freedom is about *how* the player goes about doing those goals.  Take for example a game that is close to many hearts, is not very exploratively free.  It gives you a goal.  It makes you complete that goal.  However, it lets you go about that goal in a variety of different ways.  Do you want to go in, guns-a-blazin'?  Or do you want to take the guards out one-by-one, with a tranquilizer rifle in order to not be spotted.  Or hell, do you want to play pacifist and duck through the vents to get to your goal?  Here, again, but they don't let you run wild with them.  Instead

Narrative Freedom is the thing that /r/YourMumsPal wants more of in Skyrim.  Narrative Freedom is where the developer creates a branching story and makes the player decide which branch they want to follow.  It's important to note that this is different from the other two--the other two freedoms are about gameplay.  Though Narrative Freedom can influence gameplay, which in turn provide decisions that influence their own events.  Narrative Freedom lets you impose a moral code on your character--what is he *willing* to do.  What are his desires?  Why does he do things?  Narrative Freedom is a beautiful thing when done correctly, and its perhaps the most actively engaging of the freedoms.  *This* is where Skyrim is lacking.  *This* is the thing that many developers fail to do.

In summary, and Narrative Freedom.  Each adds a piece to a puzzle of player choice.  Exploratory Freedom asks you what you want to do.  Tactical Freedom asks you how you want to do it.  Narrative Freedom asks you *why* you want to do it.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,

These would be:
Game awards shows and 
game reviews

The industry has failed so hard at doing these two thing properly it is hard to find out where to start. I guess I'll try with reviews first as I am sure many of you can relate to the issues with them.

Currently the active scale for video game reviews is something like
1-6: This game is absolute trash
7: This game was alright but not worth buying
8: This game is pretty good
9: This was a good game you should probably buy it
10: This was the most perfect game ever in all existence

I shouldn't have to explain why this is a terrible scale to put games or any other medium on. It makes it hard for people to truly judge a game to almost any amount. The part about this that sucks the most is that this grading scale is applied unanimously on just about every large gaming review site or magazine. Perhaps this is because we as gamers have a tough time actually grading games without feeling too impartial or perhaps we just have not found the right people who can truly look at a game and compare all it's features according to a real 10 point scale.

What is worse is that now that this system has become so established anyone who tries to break from it is torn down by rabid fans preventing the system from changing. 

As for game awards shows, innovative and fun games get pushed to the wayside.

While this might make every COD fan wet themselves when they hear their favorite (and sometimes only) shooter is given an award it really doesn't help the industry because it does nothing but glorify what everyone already knows. If there isn't time to gather all the releases and judge them fairly for what awards are actually being offered it hinders creativity.

Then there is how this all looks to outside parties, give credit and credence to those who call gaming a hobby as well as those who work so hard to deliver these gaming experiences to the masses.

The beauty reflected in the art of the games as well as the sales of the medium are proof enough to anyone who knows video games that they are a viable and respectable medium. But the way they present themselves in this manner takes so much away from that. The question here becomes

It seemed that maybe the kid would somehow be an exception to the time-rewind, returning to guide himself through the events necessary to deploy the restoration. It would also explain how he was able to narrate the kid's actions in such detail. Anyway, maybe that's just me.

***THIS THREAD DEFINITELY CONTAINS SPOILERS TO THE PLOT OF BORDERLANDS AND BORDERLANDS 2 -- IF YOU HAVEN'T COMPLETED THE GAME YET

Quick disclaimer:  I haven't actually completed Borderlands 2.  I've watched my friend play most of it and am working my way through the first one before I pick up the second one.  With that in mind, major plot spoilers will be in this thread -- and very early on, at that, so beware.  Anyways, here goes!

When people started finishing Borderlands 2 after its release, and Handsome Jack's deaths don't really align with the player's understanding of the universe, namely the fact that the New-U stations have been reviving the player (including Roland, in the first game) every time they die.  The New-U stations are also owned by Hyperion, which Handsome Jack -- however illegitimately -- owns.  This raises the questions of why Roland, Angel (Handsome Jack's daughter, if you haven't played), which may or may not solve the issues.  It really just depends on how you wanna rationalize it.

The other issue is that the player is allowed to respawn at all, which owns the New-U stations.  Why would Handsome Jack allow his enemy, which he spends the entire game desperately trying to kill, to have an infinite number of lives?  This, too, has some fan rationalizations that may or may not solve the issue.  Again, it depends on how far you're willing to stretch on how the story is presented to us.

By themselves, which they may very well be (not to say that the Borderlands games aren't awesome, because they are).  However, what if we compare it to the game as a whole?  Borderlands 2 put a lot of emphasis on dark humor and parody.  The whole game is over the top, really, from the snippets of dialogue that the characters spew on occasion, the actual dialogue that takes place between characters, and the nature and names of the enemies.  It's all bizarre and wacky when you look at each element of the game individually

I'm a huge proponent of gaming as an art form, which is to be expected of satire -- satire's often a hard thing to distinguish because it doesn't usually let on that it's a joke.  Borderlands is a bit more obvious about it, but gamers aren't yet used to analyzing games in this way.  Not to mention that many gamers may not even have much experience with satire, which is a pretty high-level literary technique that can really only be analyzed through experience with the technique.

So, but I'd love to hear this subreddits thoughts on Borderlands as a satire and video games as art in general.

---

Somebody needed to say it. A decade ago, highly-interactive adventures, ambitious as Hollywood blockbusters or as moving and subtle as art flicks to be played out on our TV screens, never the same way twice. We anticipated, expected a fusion of story and player choice that would become possible with the new technology we saw on the horizon. What we got in all too many cases was something else entirely.

In retrospect, some of these moments can be thrilling - for example, triggering the lights to dim at a particularly tense point in a horror game or scripting an ambush of Axis tanks and soldiers as your squad attempts to cross a river. Certainly some of the most memorable moments in all of gaming were written in by the developers, and nothing's going to change that.

But all too often these events become the easy way out, fulfilling experience.

We need look no further than the venerated gods of the medium. 1998's Half-Life used scripted events early and often - for example

But some of the moments were a little. . . off. Hours into the adventure

Six years later, only to stop the moment you crossed through a door. Enemies would attack you at regular intervals as you struggled to set up security turrets to save yourself, only to stop attacking you when an ally finally managed to open a nearby door.

Did you just flip a switch? Get ready for a half-dozen wailing zombies to pop out of the murky water around you. Did you just learn something important over the radio? Here comes a tank and some soldiers! Did you just pick up the key you needed? Get ready for the ground to collapse around you and drop you into an electrified lake you have moments to escape from!

In short

When pulled to the extreme, results in attacks, story events from out of nowhere and doom to random nearby characters whose sole reason for existence is apparently to demonstrate the method of attack of a new monster, gaming isn't happening. Story isn't happening. It's an ""experience"" only in the clinical sense: A bunch of things happen and then you go home. Roll credits.

A little game called Deus Ex came out in 2000. While it wasn't as flashy or as popular as Half-Life, or hack the building's security from afar, and it would matter. Sometimes these decisions had no direct effect on the gameplay, but they still mattered because they allowed you to be creative or barbaric, play around or take things seriously. In short, and at the risk of sounding sarcastic, you were playing a game.

Characters lived or died based on your decisions, the game's best story elements weren't scripted, but were emergent from the player's personality. Whether you were a pacifist who preferred to lurk in the shadows and secret passageways and resorted to guns only when necessary (like me) or a soldier who devastated entire installations, you felt like more than a bystander. You felt like a participant. When you broke into your old facility for information and had to make the choice of either killing the security guard you'd known for the whole game or trying to outrun his weapons, the decision felt real and genuine though it wouldn't matter to the overall story. Choices like that made the game more than just a series of events and explosions.

Playing through Dead Space last week, as you opened a door, or a character interaction with the environment caused something ""unexpected"" to happen, the impact just wasn't there. Despite Dead Space's virtues (and there were many), I felt as if the game couldn't have cared less about my participation in the story, and was perfectly happy to go on without me. The only thing that really mattered was whether I had enough health and ammo to get to Deck 19 and recalibrate the main whatchamajigger until the next crisis came up and I had to do something else. While fun, this unfortunate tendency to disrespect the player's ability to do anything other than accumulate items and shoot baddies left the experience oddly bland and unmoving.

* What core genres do you think haven't been translated well yet to mobile? What do you think is missing to make them successful? 
* What are your favorite mobile games and why do you think they are failing to attract more core gamers? 


**Explanation**

I am a game designer at a major game development studio and I specialize in mobile games. I've worked in mobile games since the flip phone days and every year I am both excited by the possibilities and depressed by the junk that rises to the top. I feel as though there is a massive community of gamers out there who own smart phones but still pretty much only play Angry Birds or hastily ported console games on their mobile devices... and I think that's because mobile game developers haven't given you all a reason to get excited about mobile yet. I think its OUR fault and I want to make it better. I don't think its because the platform is limited to shallow experiences. 

But its hard to get executives on board for a more ambitious project without either market research demonstrating demand or a comparable game performing well that they can copy-evolve into a new product. But I'm a real gamer who wants more from my mobile experiences and I'm going to do whatever it takes to create those. 

So I'm going guerrilla and hoping you all can provide me with some insights that I can use as I work towards creating something better.

I've heard both good and bad things about Super Heroes, if it's so frustrating. It's because of a genius little hook they put into Gunstar Super Heroes.

Quick Note: when I say ""the Story"" with a capital S I'm referring to both playable characters' stories, the other more laid-back and sarcastic, and their responses show it, without the narrative itself changing much.

When you play the game on Easy, like the mysterious villain [sacrificing himself when all seems lost](/spoiler), but overall the Story's a pretty kid-friendly narrative, and it's easy to boot.

When you go to Normal mode, and enemies are a bit tougher and smarter. For example, enemies with mounted machine guns can tilt them down to hit you from higher spots. However, the Story also changes: it's a bit darker. We start to learn more about the characters' back stories, things that were only murmured about in Easy mode. Notably, [one of the NPC heroes sacrifices herself instead of her brother, the aforementioned ""mysterious villain""](/spoiler).

Hard mode takes this darkness and puts into the limelight, and some really dark themes come into play (one big one being whether you're even on the right side in fighting the Empire). It's surprisingly compelling, building on the Story-lite from Easy and Normal modes to make something surprisingly good for an arcade-style run and gun game, to the point of almost being overwrought, considering the only plot you really need is the Easy mode plot/excuse to blow stuff up (and may I say that EVERYTHING blows up in this game).

Many video games repeat in a similar way. That's a huge part of the Final Fantasy and Zelda series. 

Now of course not all video games do this. Particularly in western developers you tend to have more arc based stories with a finite stretching point. And technology changes, you don't see a single game coming out for it this year. Even so I think we can probably expect new games to be coming out for those series. 

 Zelda, Castlevania, alot of these games have just celebrated their 25th anniversaries. That's a quarter of a century. I would bet they're probably going to stick around for awhile longer.

It is frustrating that most everything is so binary and linear nowadays.

Fallout / New Vegas has a bunch of binary states in the ending video (Saved the dog or didn't, and a simple ""pass/fail"" at the end.

Some games have individual quests that have a more graduated outcome (not simply ""success"" or ""fail"") but don't necessarily have the same impact in storytelling that failing a mission or two in Wing Commander did.

What I loved about Wing Commander was that even after failing a mission

It seems like I miss the old ""Choose Your Own Adventure"" style storytelling where two people might play the same game but have a very different path through it.

Playing through Skyrim now and the variety seems to come in ""which faction do you progress linearly through"" and because failing any random mission doesn't have any consequences there is no incentive or consequence for not passing it.

I think I would really like a game where you were expected to fail a certain percentage of missions or it was ""impossible"" to pass all of the challenges that were thrown your way... and depending on the ones you passed or didn't impacted the story that you end up experiencing.

1361876124.0,1994zx,Not dumbing down: RPG's and abstraction ,Roywocket,195,67,227,"Dumbing down has become this universal complaint that gets a pulled out whenever we see new releases of any game in a long running series. At the very least there will be a nod or a test of ""did they dumb down the series?"". Now off course this complaint has a basis in reality. Some games have sacrificed depth in the process of making the games available to bigger audiences. Lowering the bar of entry has cost many projects their gameplay depth

Because Dumbing down is this universal complaint is brought out the definition of it isn't crystal clear. Especially since it is used as a negative in an effort to show disapproval with changes in general. Hence why I am just clearing up what I define as dumbing down before getting to the crux of my argument.

One of the main targets the the dumbing down complaint will often be RPGs. Now this isn't unheard of since RPG have roots in fairly complicated rulesets

From their beginnings RPG's was based on abstractions of physical representations. The idea of measuring strength or dexterity as a number means that number represent the targets physical attributes. Again that means a disconnect between the player and the char. The players own input becomes almost completely irrelevant.  

With more available computing power we were able to make visual simulations dependent on our input. Where we before had a dice roll to see if our attack hit or missed dependent on our sword skill, but but are still largely determined by an internal dice roll. Leading to episodes where players are repeatedly pressing a mudcrab with a sword in an effort to get the dice roll come up as a hit.

Now this I believe is at the core of the problems of our modern day attempts at RPG's. It is not a case of RPG's dumbing down because they moved away from the use of stats

This is why it is so hard to make good RPG combat using guns. A gun is a tool designed to be solely dependent on a users accuracy

Now I am just going to throw in a disclaimer here. I absolutely love the abstract combat style of play. My personal favorite genre of all time is Turn based strategy. The whole of point I am getting at isn't that one is better than the other or that we cant have both

Now some RPG's manages to rework the old abstract elements into this new generation of calculation power. A game like Dark Souls reworked a lot of the stats into a resource management element (You have X time to do Y and increase in stat Z will increase the speed you can do Y).

Either way looking at it this

There are a lot of them (see [here](http://i.imgur.com/EjuBS.gif) and [here](http://i.imgur.com/b2OGs.jpg) (from Damien Lopez))

Personally, nice weight, and nice trigger buttons - yet the PS3 version of it is terrible (uncharacteristic for Logitech), sporting mushy shoulder buttons, no SIXAXIS, and rumble support that has disappeared after a PS3 firmware patch.

I'm not happy with any one controller. I play the PS3 and am disappointed in third party options. [This Power A controller](http://i.imgur.com/60Tyx.jpg) would be cool for variety if there wasn't a huge dead zone in the analog sticks.

Why aren't there controllers that can be customized? At least give consumers a couple of options for the core controller! Make an option with the analog stick and D-Pad switched, but I haven't enough experience with the 360's controller to do so knowledgeably)

Some topics of discussion:

* How often do you replace or maintenance your controllers? I have an Assassin's Creed controller - the R1 and X buttons are worn out; I have a shooter/action game controller

* Would you consider maintenance on your own controller? Personally, mess with screws, and I think the controllers are too expensive to justify getting new ones - mine work pretty well. I've replaced one DS3 before with two other DS3's, and switching between the two allows me to disperse wear.

* Do you customize your controller - buttons, etc?

* What's your favorite controller

Make the player feel as useless as possible

Making the player feel trapped is a great way to provoke furher hatred and satisfaction in killing the common enemy in the game. For instance, you can still use your weapons, you can't see his health bar, and you are left to be destroyed.

I think this really helps drive the point of anger for the boss/evil of the game home. You spend the rest of the game hating every enemy you encounter and you don't feel bored or overplayed with enemies and their death scripts.

During the death throes of the point-and-click adventure game

The control scheme in Grim Fandango felt silly. The gameplay was functionally identical to earlier Lucasarts point-and-click adventure titles. The fact that you had to pilot your character around via the arrow keys felt like a pointless minigame that you had to play all the time. It felt to me like an attempt to trick potential buyers into thinking it was one of the third-person 3D platformers that were popular at the time. 

Planescape: Torment can be played almost entirely without combat, but I think it's fairly clear that you could turn the game into a straight-up dialogue-based point-and-click while maintaining virtually everything that made it great.

(Tangentially: I love it when games admit multiple playstyles, and no weapon specialization, relying on dialogue, companions, and VATS.)

There is something I have noticed in gaming however

After the mission ended I realized how many shots it took to kill someone

This is of course the standard in almost any game though when you increase the difficulty. The bad guys do not get smarter, or use tactics, they act the exact same way on previous difficulties, but can just take a lot more hits, and in some cases, you can't take as many. I remember this being the way all the way back to when I first played the first Halo and my brother and I were trying to clear Legendary difficulty for the first time. It was not that the enemies were better then us, they were simply stronger than us. 

To me this takes away from the players experience with the game, it should not take 6 head shots to down a unarmored wasteland wanderer. That makes me very aware I am playing a game, especially when he is running at me with a baseball bat and shrugging of bullets like BB's.

 Personally

 The reason for preferring silent is purely from an immersion factor. The majority of RPGs give you dialogue options to chose. I will sit there and read them all through before deciding what I want to chose. I have read that text in my head

 The Mass Effect games have given me the most enjoyment from a voiced protagonist so far, is that what is said is not always what you wanted/expected to have been said. I felt that it made me feel more like I was playing a sci-fi movie where I had vague interaction with the cut scenes more so than I was completely absorbed in my character. 

 Good examples of silent protagonists that have completely absorbed me are things like the fallout and elder scrolls games. Even something like final fantasy 6, 9 where you have a lot less in terms of dialogue options, but reading it all in my head like a book, giving everyone my own voice, tone, feelings behind the words etc completely and utterly absorbs me in the story and experience.

I thank you in advance for your time and comments.
_________________

The fairy tale paradigm is one that is, a princess, and a dragon are some of the oldest and most well worn archetypes of the storytelling world. A knight has to rescue a princess who is helplessly trapped by some opposition, oftentimes a witch or a dragon (for the sake of simplicity, I will refer to this archetype simply as “the dragon,” given that is the most iconic symbol of opposition, though this role could also be filled by a witch, or some other such being). The knight is always trustworthy and honorable

It is not hard to see why this paradigm is so rampant. In video games, a gigantic spiny creature is going to be perceived as “evil,” but in video games, that perception is further enhanced by the achievement of killing said creature. In most video games, beating a level or killing a boss is considered a good thing, an achievement worth celebrating, and thus most players assume that when they get to the next level or kill the boss

Yet it is possibly because of this historic acceptance of the fairy tale paradigm that some video games strive to go against it. Notably

 

The Knight

The game opens up with the main character taking the Princess, which is supposed to save the Princess. He, of course, listens to the voice and proceeds throughout the game to actually kill the colossi.

The first apparent subversion of the paradigm is apparent in the character, and a horse, but he does not use them like the knights of past fairy tales. He can barely swing the sword, losing his center of balance each time he swings on land. His horse and him have a special bond, but his horse acts less like a tool of the rider and more like an organic being. They journey through the game as partners and not as master and servant. He can shoot a bow, but beyond the various wildlife in the countryside, he never hurts anyone or anything seriously with it.

He can also do various tricks with his horse

These actions also show off just how different this character is from the archetype of a knight. He is specifically not a warrior, but rather the actions of one who is easily distracted, who has a natural curiosity, who acts in many ways like a child. He is a child focused on one goal, saving the Princess, but he is a child nonetheless. This naivety will come back later in the game.

The Dragons

The colossi in this game are unlike most other game bosses. They are threatening, buildings that are overgrown with moss and ivy that have somehow been given life. Except for a few of them, they are mostly slow and deliberate, seeming to calculate every move. They moan and groan as if they are actually old men who have not left their houses for a long time. They seem to carry around history on their back and in their limbs.

There are some exceptions, but for the most part, they are dramatically majestic towers of ruins. The only way the player can actually kill them is by scurrying up their sides clumsily and stabbing them, also rather clumsily, in glowing weak spots. Whereas the main character is displayed as someone young and naive, new to the world and occupying only a small part of it, these giants embody the desolate world around them. They have been here for quite a while and do not simply live in the land; they are part of the land.

These colossi fulfill the role of the Dragon accurately enough. They are the obstacle that keeps the Princess from her Knight

But there is another layer beyond the obvious visual layer. The colossi are clearly aggressive. Many, bare their claws, or fire upon them in violent ways. But the key is that they are not the invader. They do not play the Dragon that comes and kidnaps the Princess while destroying the kingdom. If anything, that is the player’s job, who comes into a land and kills the colossi, also killing a living, moving

Eventually, for that to be the case. Instead, the player is almost raping the land, going through colossus after colossus, to get what he wants. The temple with the Princess begins to fill up with rubble where there used to be statues.

Furthermore, and the player has no idea what it is doing to the main character throughout the game. However, the black essence does not seem to be helping the main character at all. The Wanderer coughs and then passes out after each infection. The infection raises poses several questions to the audience, “How does killing a colossus help his cause?” “Is killing a colossus good?” “What is happening to the Wanderer?” The game purposefully does not answer these questions, instead silently encouraging the player to stop the killing. However, both the player and the main character know that they will not stop the killing because they want to get what they want. In this way, the game is making a comment on both the character’s treatment of the colossi and the player’s willingness to kill beauty in order to “win” the game.

The Princess

The final element of the paradigm is the Princess. In the game, and does not do anything except look pretty.

The Princess is not a real person; she is an ideal. She is the embodiment of beauty, but the player has no reason to love her or to think that their relationship is real. In fact, because the main character acts like a naive child, the player has a reason to believe that the main character’s desire for her is not based on anything real. After all, the Wanderer is not old, wise, or down to earth. He looks like a little child climbing up the colossi: a small boy in a world much larger and much more intricate than him.

This idealization of the Princess is carried out in the final scene of the game when the main character, thus allowing the player to attempt to reach the Princess, reach the ideal, but ultimately fail. The final scene is a commentary on the failings of idealization and the unfortunate blindness that comes from romantic love. Like Romeo, his love for the Princess led him to make the ultimate sacrifice without even realizing what he was doing.

However, after he gets sucked into a spell, the Princess actually wakes up. She gets up and there is no one around except for the Wanderer’s horse. Who leads her to a baby.

Here is where Shadow of the Colossus manages to both critique and celebrate the ideals of the Wanderer. For even though the Wanderer’s quest for love led him to corruption, something was born out of it. It is not clear what was born exactly, but there is something. That something is new life, which could lead to just about anything. It is not perfect. There are horns reflecting the nature of its birth. But it is something.


In all its subversion and critique, the Wanderer’s love led to the destruction of the landscape and of himself. In each case, however, the works end with a note of hope. Romeo and Juliet’s deaths led to the ending of a historic family feud. The Wanderer’s love was unrealistic and idealistic, but something came out of it. The Wanderer was blinded by his ambitions, but something came out of it. The Wanderer did many things that he should not have, but something came out of it. Whether or not that something was worth the trials and sacrifices is really left up to the audience.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/12dl8p/shadow_of_the_colossus_and_the_subversion_of_the/

Well, Reckoning bucks this *tradition*. It is the first game to try to do all four of the main RPG elements well: 

* Narative

* Exploration

* Advancement

* **Combat**

But the most important thing is that the creators are not going to the opposite extreme and saying ""Let's focus exclusively on combat"". Instead

The ""visionary"" for Reckoning is none other than [Ken Rolston](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Rolston), [Todd McFarlane](http://www.ea.com/news/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-interview-with-todd-mcfarlane).

This is the closest that we have to a God of War style combat system that I've ever seen in a full-featured RPG. There are a number of combat elements in the video that really stand out:

* Dodge roll and parry

* Fast and fluid strikes

* There is ""weight"" behind the attacks

* Accuracy in the strikes

* Risk/Reward system in the power of the strikes

* Cancel regular attacks into block/roll/magic! Fuck yeah!

* Context sensitive attacks -- attack out of dodge

* Air launcher! Fuck yeah!

* Teleport

* Change weapons mid combo

* Timing-based combos

Gaming is unique from movies or books in that in most cases you are driving the main character towards their goals by your own actions. Are you more invested in a game's story because you are experiencing it along with the main character? Perhaps the long development periods of games and the limitations of previous generations have an affect. Star Wars has a long established history on film


I have mixed feelings about the topic. In series like Metal Gear Solid or Halo, it would be upsetting. In contrast to that, some series simply do not take their own stories very seriously. I am talking about series like Metroid, Mortal Kombat, or Legend of Zelda. These are games that DO have a story, and sometimes are quite good, but the focus of the game is not usually on finding out what happens story-wise. Gameplay drives these games, I would be fine with it to an extent. Change is good,False,

I tried playing games like Dota 2, but I found out quickly that many people don't like having relatively new players on their team, and those that do are few and far between.  I got the idea for an adopt-a-noob type feature, a mechanic where a new player has a choice to go into a game with a volunteer veteran of the game and the vet could help the noob get better.  Team Fortress 2 has this type of feature but there is really no incentive for players to do it.  In TF2 the reward for helping a certain amount of players could be a new hat or something else cosmetic, or in WoW you could get a special tabard or shirt, or in Dota gain access to some cosmetics and maybe a new HUD or something like that.  Regardless of what players get out of it, it would help the community of the game grow and generally get better.  What's your opinion on adopt-a-noob type features?

1350757442.0,11t25t,Persistent world FPS campaign,wirther,155,40,82,"This is an idea I thought of just now. Let me know if there is a game that is already like this:

Imagine a FPS campaign where you start off invading a country Normandy style, but instead stay in the present time and have to make your way to the next mission on your own. I imagined the gameplay being split up into various batallions you could join. So there could be a default batallion you're assigned to after the successful Normandy invasion, and that batallion's mission could be to drive to some nearby town to take over. Or, you could just drive wherever you wanted, and whatever batallion is closest to you would have to adopt you for their mission. Or, if you drive far enough away, you could be considered a deserter, you could then go lone wolf style and just kill everyone in sight

The way the missions work would be minor town based battles for each batallion that eventually lead up to over-arching major battles. Since the world is persistent, and if you decide to rejoin a batallion, the main mission could be something completely different from what it was before. For example, in your default batallion after Normandy, you could have a minor mission of securing some town, with the main mission being to penetrate the front line and take over an important base. If you dick around long enough, then you will eventually hear through some radio transmission that the major goal of securing the enemy base was successful

To increase the replayability factor, the placement of important bases and enemy positions could be randomized with each new campaign.

What is with games now-a-days being constantly set in bleak desolate places where the player saves the world? It may just be a coincidence and make for a good story or is there something more? I started thinking about 'this generation' ( late 80’s and early 90’s kids). Is this fascination with destroyed and ruined worlds a Freudian slip or perhaps a hidden thought of what ‘this generation’ thinks and how it feels about the world and their future? Do we make and play games where we save the world because we really do want to save our real world: climate change, financial recessions, etc. Or perhaps we play these games because we feel that we cannot cause such change in our own failing world?

Kickstarter has rejuvenated a number of developers and older franchises. Masterpieces such as Fallout are now being given away for free (temporarily). And of course there are certain ""mainstream"" games like Skyrim or the Mass Effect that have offered cinematic

The future of gaming really does belong to the consumers. The big companies make groundbreaking games here and there, and cash grabbing. On the whole it's been our support of smaller developers that has really helped push out innovative, original, quality products.

I'm amazed at games like Legend of Grimrock being offered for only $12 while providing a thorough gaming experience. 

I miss the old era

Game on.

**edit** - some minor controversy in the comments below. Someone asked how CoD is a cash grab. My reasoning is that each subsequent game is largely derivative of its predecessor with little major innovation. There's nothing wrong with giving people a product that is comfortable and familiar, not an argument about Call of Duty.

*edit 2** - still getting comments about why it's not okay for CoD to not be innovative, rehash it, put out a new product. There's nothing evil about it, but in my opinion it's a cash grab - something that plays it safe because the developers know people will buy the game. That's not to say lots of effort didn't go into the game. Some of you are really taking offense at specific comments that aren't there.

**edit 3** - never underestimate Call of Duty fans 

**edit 4** - it's funny that someone in the comments said I leapt on someone for asking me why CoD is a cash grab, and DEMANDING I prove that CoD is a cash grab and that it is no longer innovative. A few people have provided rational insight into why they feel CoD is not a cash grab, but most are lashing out defensively. If your minds have formed opinions based on your gaming tastes which I respect, it's not worth the effort to show you my viewpoint. Here's an example from the comments:

*""It seems that everyone is very unappreciative and in a matter spoiled. They expect everything to appeal to their needs only. But do not look at that this game appeals to many others needs and theirs is not important. And people like you do not like that.""*

That seems personal, I'm not questioning whether you find value in the game or not. If you get hundreds of hours of enjoyable gameplay, more power to you. My point is about the lacking incentive for them to take risks. Most developers who take risks end up doing so independently because the main publishers don't find their concepts profitable compared to the tried and true Call of Duty. Same trend applies to movies. 

I'll use the Michael Bay analogy again - his movies make a ton of money and take a hell of a lot of man hours to create. Are they quality movies? That's up to you. There's entertainment value

First of all, let's talk about the characterization and what this game does right.

There are so many things right off the bat which define Phoenix's character. The fact that he stutters and seems very nervous while Mia points out that it's very unusual that a lawyer's first case is a *murder trial* give us an idea of who Phoenix is as a person. Then comes a self-monologue wherein he delivers the background of the case and he states with certainty that Butz couldn't have done it. Why? 

&gt;But I know better than anyone

That's it. That's all Phoenix is going on: a gut feeling. One of the major thematic elements of the game is Phoenix's intuition triumphing over overwhelming odds. Within the first few seconds of the game

Of course, Phoenix seems like an utterly confused and helpless rookie, but then Butz comes in and delivers his lines of dialogue:

&gt;Dude

This puts Phoenix's character into perspective and also provides contrast to the seemingly stoic attitude of Mia. Phoenix may be nervous and helpless compared to Mia

Then, with his bald head and long beard. 

Then

Think about everything we know about Phoenix at the point you meet Edgeworth. Edgeworth is the *exact* opposite of that. He is the perfect foil character across the courtroom for Phoenix. Edgeworth is prim, Edgeworth is *logical* and *rational*. For the next two cases against Edgeworth, Phoenix *only* triumphs over Edgeworth's cold, hard, brutal, calculating style because of a sudden revelation, either brought on by his own intuition or something mystical. Edgeworth does not hesitate to show his disdain for everything illogical and intangible while this is what *Phoenix fucking relies on* almost every case. This is what's called ""theming."" And it's so perfectly executed. 

But here's the strange thing: we are led to despise Edgeworth because he represents everything Phoenix is not

To put it simply

Onto thematic structure... I'm going to just put this out there: to me

Lets say you have your favorite base ball bat in your hands and you see a nice knife you want to use later on as a thrown weapon, nope the knife replaced it. Now I need to open my inventory select the baseball bat, hit equip, select the slot I want and now I can go back to the game. Doesn't sound like much but when you do this 4-5 times every 10-15 minutes it gets very annoying very fast.

Throwing this game has it, so now I'm holding a grenade, switch to my next knife and throw it, now I'm holding a medkit. Gets annoy very fast when you have 5-6 zombies coming at you. 

Collecting my throwing weapons cannot be any more frustrating. Basically combine the issues of finding weapons with setting your inventory into one cluster fuck. Every time you pick one of your weapons up it replaces your current weapon

Look at baseball. You start playing in pee wee leagues. You won't even have a pitcher, but the bases are still very close together and the fence is not far. And then you get to the pros, which has the most difficult field layout, and most restrictive rules.

Games that call themselves E-Sports though? They don't do this. Gameplay is balanced first and foremost for extreme level play. If a weapon or tactic is OP in the hands of a pro, or can only modestly make it perform.

Every single real sport has multiple sets of rules based on the skill and knowledge of those playing at each level. Save E-Sports


Specific examples of this from Tribes Ascend.

-Expert flag cappers can routinely and reliably hit the flag at 250+

-Expert snipers can shut down a match. But expert snipers are very few and far between

Tribes Ascend is very much a game designed for skilled vets being played by unskilled players. There is no 'T-ball' style play.. You just get stuck on the same field with the same bats the pros have to use.

1333211637.0,rmig7,Wii-U Hopes &amp; Expectations,TuckerThaTruckr,168,58,279,"What I hope for from the Nintendo Wii-U

With all the rumors &amp; speculation going on recently concerning the next generation of gaming consoles

1. A de-emphasis on motion controls. This seems likely due to the fact that the primary controller is the tablet. I can't imagine having to waggle that beast in place of a button press. My hope is that motion controls were a good way to widen the market overall but ultimately a feint to get Microsoft &amp; Sony to spend resources trying to provide a similar input method. I read a comment somewhere the other day that summed up my feelings perfectly: This generations 1st party Nintendo games were great despite their motion controls rather than because of them. I think it would also be a good idea to offer some of this generation's great Nintendo games via digital download and/or at retail with the controls tweaked to remove the waggle. My prime candidates for this overhaul would include both Galaxy games, a game I wanted to love but didn't mainly due to waggle replacing a button press. Buttons as the primary input was never broken, I'm not sure why they tried to fix it.

2. Keep It Simple, &amp; radar to the smaller screen. The other function that sounds like a winner is to use the tablet as your own personal gaming screen so as not to hog the TV. I think Nintendo has realized that while people certainly take their handhelds on the go with them, a significant portion play them some or most of the time while sitting at home. For example, I could have an NFL game going on the big screen while being able to quickly hop back into my paused Wii-U game during commercials or halftime without having to change inputs on the TV.

3. Two tablet functionality. Speaking of the NFL

4. Minimize load-times &amp; system noise. Nintendo has always been a leader in these fields. I realize people want Wii-U to be powerful. I do too. However, is the high-pitched white noise produced pretty much whenever it is turned on. I know this stuff is nitpicking but it is one of the advantages of using less than cutting edge technology. 

5. Less story, I read a book or watch a movie. The stories of gaming come out of the circumstances of playing the game. Bottom line, I want to be playing as opposed to watching or reading. 

6. Misc. Release date of 11/11/12 or 11/18/12. MSRP of $299 or less. Major retail games @ $60

7. Online presence. I think everyone expects a much greater emphasis on  a service similar to Sony &amp; Microsoft. However, for 1st party titles at least.

8. Lastly, but I'm hopeful about Wii-U.

TL;DR De-emphasize motion controls, &amp; make it easy for me to be gaming quickly. Also, I'm a Nintendo fanboy.

1324675732.0,nod42,Can an RPG without metagaming still be an RPG?,caligari87,182,66,132,"I'v had a long beef with the RPG genre in general

In almost every RPG I've played, or pick skills, etc. Whenever I see these games discussed online, many discussions devolve into the mechanics and stats more than the gameplay or story.

For example, but there's still an awful lot of skill-picking, leveling up, etc. I'm curious to know if it's possible to design a good RPG *without* these elements. In a game such as Oblivion, it's always been immersion-breaking and annoying for me to need to open up a window and check if I've finally balanced my thieving skill with my dexterity score, or to see ""Leveled up Swordfighting!"" after a battle and immediately be able to kill the same monster in one hit instead of two.

I'm envisioning a situation where the game itself would track a massive amount of data such as skill sets, situations, behavior, etc, but all of this data and the interplay behind it would be invisible to the player. I'd never want to do any meta-character building outside of the initial creation process, everything would (hopefully) be a natural progression.

This begs the question of how to illustrate this progression to the player in an equally natural way; If I don't select ""Advanced Lockpicking II"" from a skill menu

As the title of the post clearly implies

I was inspired by the recent Starcraft 2 inspired e-sports magazine ""GLHF"" by the professional look they gave their magazine and overall style in which they presented their work. Also

So, who would be interested in helping out and any other related topics.

Theoretically

* Writing Team
* Design Team 
* Editors   
* Technical Help
 
I personally would like to take the magazine down the route of a more think-piece article with a mix of general gaming news which tends to be what the majority of successful posts here are focused around.

This would have to be non-profit, I'm sure the experience of being in a team that creates magazines would look pretty good on a CV for someone who wanted to join the media industry.

I think that if people were to post their opinions on what you think the magazine should be here

The magazine itself could be bi-monthly

The team itself should keep in contact with each other too so as there is not a reason for mistakes in the final product.

As I've said before

I think requirements for the team should be:

**Writing Team:**

* Coherent and fluid use of English
* Reliable and can keep to deadlines
* Able to think of engaging material
* Decent spelling (no need for immaculate spelling as it can be cleaned up by editors
* Enthusiasm and knowledge of industry

**Design Team:**

* Experience with design work is preferred 
* Can utililise an editing/publishing software to create good looking articles
* Orderly and effective approach 
* Can meet deadlines and work well under pressure
* Enthusiasm and knowledge of industry

**Editors:**

* Keen eye for picking up mistakes
* Good communication skills
* Meet deadlines
* Work with initiative


I think that just about rounds it up - I'm confident that we could make this happen even if it's only for one issue and let's not get ahead of ourselves but this has the ***possibility*** to give us a little extra something in the pocket at the end of the month. I can't stress how that it only a possibility and how it can only be achieved through hard work and determination to do the best we can.

I'm referring to the controversy over several EA games being pulled from Steam because they would not offer DLC through Steam

If you look at how DLC tends to work for PC games

Let's look at how Team Fortress 2 works. You open up TF2. While in TF2 you access a store and buy stuff. Awesome. Convenient. You don't have to do ANYTHING outside of the game. (Steam

Most games want to have a system pretty much like that. It's awesome and convenient. Hence why TF2 does it. However

So developers of other games use some other account that is universal for all players who own the game

Not as easy as Steam having it already, getting the exact same experience.

Steam is basically asking games to program their DLC to work in two ways rather than one. They can use the above system I described for all of their non-steam consumers-- and they can program something to work like the Call of Duty games for steam users. Where you navigate to a store page and buy the DLC.

What happens when you buy the DLC through steam is essentially you getting a CD key, for the sake of simplicity, the actual content hosting and download of the DLC will usually be through the game's proprietary system, rather than through steam.

In the end, for all their users-- Valve's system. As as individual, I'm actually in favor of this, because I love Steam and the convenience of Steamworks, achievements, etc. I view a game coming with Steamworks as a +10% on review scores when I consider buying it, for all intents and purposes.

I find these expectations unrealistic from people that don't actually understand what happens in game design. People use the label ""scriped event"" in games as a bad thing, or there would not be correct assets to fit the event (talking games with stories, voice acting here). So essentially, people that expect more than one or two similar endings are expecting the developers to lay out an unending series of scripted events that occur based on what the player did.

Is there something I'm missing here? Are your expectations actually warranted? Or am I correct in assuming that people who hate on games for having a ""false sense of choice"" have far too high of expectations?

I'd also be interested in games that had fully developed stories that had a true sense of choice that didn't result in a few ""scripted"" endings. Clearly, because I generally only see it in small quips with no real process behind it.

* My first problem was actually the worst yet simplest: button layout. When a game is not 100% true to the standard layout in a genre it tends to be tedious to find one's way back into it. I'm sure we all remember the small number of PSX games where O was considered ""confirmation"" instead of X. Obviously the answer would be to either use the standard layout or make it customizable. At the same time I already found it very helpful to have a way to view the button functions in the game or at least in the manual.

* The second big problem for me was remembering all the skills names, you know, just name things in a descriptive way.

* Thirdly my skill had deteriorated when I picked up action oriented games after a while. I could no longer keep up with the mechanics required

* And now for the grand issue that made me spend 30 minutes reading up, why and when up until that point in the game without going through 100 pages some very dedicated developers typed up for even more dedicated fans. I know that in one the mario games you can let the game walk you through solving the level. Why not include something like this to remember specific pieces of the story whenever you feel puzzled? Stop a cutscene, mark a character and let the game show you what you've been told about him. Basically the guy who played through it a dozen times and sits next to you but inside the game.

I have been asking around lately because I am curious on what people like when they read game reviews.  Right now I'm trying to find out what people like as far as scoring goes for games.  Some grading styles I often see are...

* #/5
* #/10
* #/100
* A grade scale (A,D,F) 
* A buy style (Buy, Pass, etc.)

and I'm sure there are more ideas. 

 

So what is your favorite style?  Do you like lower numbers or higher numbers?  Do you not like numbers at all?  These scores also need to be backed up with words

It appears (though confirmation seems vague and hard to find) that Zero will be the sniper class similar to Mordecai in the first Borderlands

This made me wonder about the popularity of the sniper class in general. I'll admit I don't play any competitive online FPS like BF3 etc, if not an outright majority. 

Like I said, but I tend to avoid tanking/melee attacks, and prefer distance attacks and weapons. I played Mordecai in Borderlands (solo) and am really hoping to find a scope soon in STALKER, which I just started. In Bastion I relied on the Scrap Musket (faster than waiting for Carbine to aim), in Mass Effect 1/2 I used carbines or sniper rifles almost exclusively, etc, etc.

1365811811.0,1c8pcd,Exploration in open-world games: We need more Blackreaches,l3un1t,137,26,58,"There's a moment in open-world games where the blindfold is taken off. 
It's that moment when you emerge from Vault 113, it's not really something that happens all too often in videogames. 

Don't get me wrong, I'm not referring to being pushed into another room; I'm talking about being pushed *outdoors*. In both antechambers and ""dinky little shacks"", you can walk with your hand along the walls and find yourself exactly where you were before. Until you open a door to another room, you can keep doing this for a very long time. Outdoors, however... there's so much *more*.

There's so much to see, so many cities to find, so many ruins to explore, so much stuff. So, so much stuff. And the lore! There's a silly amount of lore too, whether it be descriptions of monumental moments in the world's history, the origins of a particular item/enemy, in fact, and it's what helps makes the world a *world*

That's not to denounce the antechamber, lore, but struggles to equal in full. The antechamber excels at being toured, whilst the outdoors excels at being explored. 

This is why we need more Blackreaches. Sort of. 

Blackreach, underground, cavern, filled with the ruins of the technologically-advanced Dwemer (elf equivalent to dwarves), an extinct race whose closed-in ruins you've likely discovered throughout the game. Not only do Dwemer ruins inspire mystery and wonder, but they contrast so deeply with the setting of Skyrim itself. The entire game, you find yourself familiar with [fields](http://static.skyrim.nexusmods.com/mods/images/9503-1-1329183403.jpg), [cities](http://gamethingdaily.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/tesvskyrim.jpeg), mysterious, and therein lies the lost oppertunity. 

You are assigned a mission -- *find the elder scroll* -- and *led* by an arrow floating in the sky, hiding at the icy fringes of the world. This old wizard gives you the blocky keys to Blackreach in the hopes you will return with a key for his own device(s), and off you go, to climb to the top of a mountain, only to fight your way to it's depths, where the door to Blackreach lies ""hidden"". 

I found out that this was actually part of a mission some time after I had found the old man.

You see, and imagine as though it's something you've stumbled upon. You can run your hands along the massive, unfathomably huge walls of Skyrim and feel your hands slip over a crack in the most unexpected of places, and in that moment, a flash of surprise overwhelms, and curiosity consumes you.  After some searching, you find the strangely-designed doorknob, and you open up a bizarrely beautiful room that you never knew existed. *You* find this room. *You* find Blackreach. This is the sort of Blackreach that should be

This is exploration. This is what the outdoors can accomplish. This is what an antechamber can accomplish when it hides the door with something other than sheer size

Much of the wonder of discovery is taken away when an arrow points the way to the man with the keys. That's assuming that there *is* a man with the keys, but in doing so, they abolish the notion of discovery. Plus, these doors can become *too* hidden. There is no joy in spending hours upon hours hopelessly combing a wall with a microscope when the only reward will be a tasty easter egg. Tasty it may be, but it's hardly the feast earned for the week's worth. 

Unfortunately, they cease to be hidden, and merely become out of sight. If every game began to include ""hidden wonders"" like Blackreach, they would cease to be either hidden or wonders. 

Yet, but some of them need to be *discovered*, whether they lie in an antechamber *or* ""in"" the outside. Antichamber itself is a *game* of discovered ""Aha!""s that I myself find fantastic, yet it hardly stirred up [the](/spoiler) massive critical acclaim [of Bioshock Infinite](/spoiler)[, a game which suddenly thrusts you into it's own ""Aha!"" moment (fun fact: SPOILER ABOUT THE GAME AHEAD)](/spoiler)[as you drown in the clutches of the multiverse Elizabeths](/spoiler). 

*The omitted text is meant to prevent spoiling games

Games need to be able to *give* as well as *hide* their ""Aha!"" moments. The latter is far more difficult to craft, doomed to lose. Not only must gamers *find* the first crumb in the trail; they must actively follow it, which can prove difficult and unrewarding if poorly implemented, *or* if implemented to a crowd used to following the arrows to the ""Aha!"" moments. 

As it stands, Skyrim, Antichamber](/spoiler)) and my frustration with finding these hidden doors to hidden doors is one massive irony, and might illustrate the very problem with crafting these wonderful sort of moments. 

Anyways, you. Hopefully it inspires discussion!

1336422545.0,tbpg8,So QuakeLive. Why aren't people playing it? I truly believe it is the quintessential e-sports game and no game today has surpassed it in that regard.,johndoe42,173,63,184,"QuakeLive recently tried a push to get more subscribers in by having a free premium weekend. Normally

While QuakeLive is essentially an in-browser Quake3

Then this past week they've introduced a few more modes that up the ante. They've introduced modes like ""domination"" which a lot of players are familiar with from modern FPS games. They even have an ""attack and defend"" a turn-by-turn capture-the-flag which was incredibly fun in my experience and really made team play fun. We'll see if this causes an increase in subscribers...but it doesn't look good.

As for why QuakeLive is the best e-sports game in my opinion: its a combination of the skill required by the game, I don't even feel a connection to my teammates, its all about ""me."" I don't even feel a connection to my opponent. But in Quake, its almost the exact opposite, if one player is slacking off or not contributing it is immediately apparent and the team suffers. You also start to adjust your strategy based on who you're fighting, as different styles lend themselves to different approaches. There's also a certain etiquette, if a team is imbalanced you are asked to sit and wait until someone else comes. The skill level of players is respected

But as for the game's mechanics

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XdkDjsBiO58

Most games, resource control is intrinsic to more exciting gameplay. Timing items, positioning yourself on the map, knowing your enemies chosen items, adding his or her armor and health in your head, knowing your own and crafting your engagement around this creates a far more layered battle than just shooting each other in the face. Just to highlight one strategy: if your opponent has a rocket launcher and you have a lightning gun, the intelligent thing to do is to increase your distance so that their % of accuracy decreases, so its like a mini chess game each encounter. 

Couple this with Capture the Flag or Team Deathmatch and you have an incredibly complex match. Even /r/Starcraft sees this in comparison with other FPS games:

1331500114.0,qrxq3,In the wake of events that transpired with Bioware over the course of last year are you interested in Dragon Age 3?,MaidenMadness,200,90,239,"Fact of the matter is that for many people


Oh yeah to warn people text beyond here will contain some major Dragon Age spoilers.

Whereas last year before Dragon Age 2 pretty much everyone gave Bioware full confidence because of their near flawless record I imagine that now the number of people that have full confidence in Bioware delivering an excellent game is significantly smaller.

Personally I don't know how interested in Dragon Age 3 I am. On one hand I invested a lot of time in Dragon Age franchise having played and finished Origins

We were lead to believe then that Hawke is one of the greatest heroes in the history of Thedas and that DA2 is kinda of an intro to the story of where he came from
Dragon Age 2 was just that Hawke: An Intro


So from the outset Dragon Age 3 doesn't look appealing. Wow a story about a war between Templars and Mages that's really creative. It sounds as if somebody took that entire quest line from DA:O and just expanded it to a full game which sounds lazy and quite frankly not too reassuring in the light of how rehashed things in Dragon Age 2 were.  New hero character doesn't help either because if Dragon Age 3 is about a new hero that means that we'll probably never going to get a satisfactory conclusion to Hawke's story.
However if a new hero is actually Bioware's way of saying forget Dragon Age 2
That means I finally get down to gameplay of Dragon Age 2 and... I'm not impressed. Dragon Age 2 combat was pretty but dumb and repetitive. Any attempt to use any tactics was made useless by enemies appearing in waves from thin air in all directions. It was just button mashing which got rather boring pretty quickly. Enemies also weren't particularly impressive. Locations were rather bland and easy to forget. 

Bottom line is that when thinking about Dragon Age 3 I personally see few things which would make me interested in it. Perhaps conclusion to the story about war between mages and templars from DA2 but that's about the only thing I can see which DA3 has going for it and truth be told I didn't find the story of DA2 to be particularly compelling so it's not like I have to know how it ends.

As a starting idea, and they each act autonomously. Your specific team will be called your ""entourage"" and those are the only guys you can get certain commands to. The other teams handle cover fire, or advancement, or anything else that seems plausible. There would be commands to give them such as ""storm this room,"" but you wouldn't be able to order those in that other team to execute specific commands like ""Lift that enemy."" 

I envision that switching who is in the party should be smooth, but you'd have to wait for Kaiden to make it to where you are before you could give him orders.

Are we being bullied by publishers?,jtm33,155,47,94,"There is a problem in the gaming industry that I don't think gets as much coverage as it deserves. I believe this is because it is an issue that mainly affects people outside of the US. In an industry with US-based media dominating websites it can often be hard to find gaming related content that is not relevant to US consumers. It is a very confusing issue
 
http://i.imgur.com/1tt0m.jpg

That is a showcase of a mix of several digital distribution stores, and brick-and-mortar retailers that I may choose to buy my games from. Your likely reaction to seeing all of that is confusion. 

**What's happening here?**

What you are seeing is Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, and these retailers, are charging us a lot more to buy their games. It can sometimes cost up to three times as much to buy from a local store than to buy online. Now to be clear this is not an Australia specific problem, however it is probably worse here than in many other places.

**What does this mean?**

This means whenever I want to buy a new game I am faced with the reality of usually paying $85-120 ($89-$125USD) to buy it from a local store, which post you a boxed copy of the game from overseas. If I don't want to pay the price of a boxed import or cannot otherwise find a fair price I wait for a sale to bring the price down.

Sometimes it is not about pricing. European people will be very familiar with the idea of having games released later in the week than in the US. An extreme example of this is ""The Old Republic"" not releasing in Australia until this month. Regional lockouts for digital stores is a widespread

**Why is this a problem?**

A summary of the issues that I regularly face should highlight why this trend is troubling.

- I cannot buy from a local retail store without paying twice as much for games.

- If I want to buy digitally I am often faced with 50% mark-ups or locked out from buying at all.

- Digital games are often released later than in the US.

- I can get a boxed copy of a game shipped to the other side of the Earth and pay less than half than what it costs for me to walk down the street and buy it there.

- But I have to wait 1-2 weeks for my boxed copy from across the Earth to arrive.

- Some region restrictions may mean I have no legitimate avenue to buy a game I want.

With that summarised I get to the crux of this rant:

**The game industry is over 30 years old

A brief history lesson. Games have always been expensive here. Everything is expensive here. I grew up without a games console until a bought a PS2 with my own money in 2005. Most of my gaming growing up was on our PC, it is the end of horrifically expensive gaming here. Or so I thought when I made my Steam account in 2007.

Then something happened. I cannot remember many specifics but in 2009

Thankfully I have discovered other avenues to pay a fair price for games

**So why is this happening?**

From my understanding:

- Publishers control most of these issues

- Retailers have no choice. Sometimes

- They are trying to take distribution methods

- They think regional pricing is effective in a world where buying a boxed or digital game from across the world is easy and cheap.

- Publishers are trying to appease retailers by artificially increasing prices so as to not undercut brick-and-mortar stores which are still a large part of the industry.

**What can be done?**

I see the recent discussion and controversy about DLC and charging full price for an incomplete game. It can be hard to get angry about charging $10 extra for DLC when we are being asked to spend an extra $60 for the base game. I have thought about the commonly recited methods of protest: do not buy, higher prices, more DLC, more exploitation.

I will end with how a feel about all of this

1322963496.0,mzas9,Does the Auteur Theory apply to video games?,Gumbee,145,40,70,"In 1954 there was this little French guy called Fancois Truffaut.  You may have heard his name mentioned once or twice in the pretentious rantings of a film-school dropout while trying to enjoy your Starbucks latte, The Last Metro), and then assuming that it continues and even progresses from one film to the next.  Basically

The Coen Brothers are often used to exemplify the theory: with each new film they make, and everyone behind the scenes may change, but the film they produce is always undeniably a Coen Brothers film.  As filmmakers, their work always conveys a certain series of messages and themes (the power, or lack thereof of money, naivety, ignorance triumphing over power etc.) that is distinctly theirs. 

So, only good and bad directors"" ring true for video games as well?  Is the work of an auteur typically better than that of his peers?  What role in the development of a video game deserves credit for authorship?

Let’s first start with the latter.  In gaming, and not it's executive producer Casey Hudson.  For the most part gamer, and game developer alike seem reluctant to praise the individual.  Video game development is perceived as being such a largely collaborative effort that the credit is most often attributed to the team behind the game, and not the person.  But is there ever a singular person that deserves the credit for the creation of a video game?  Right now, the answer tends to be no, but it's quickly becoming the opposite.

What seems to be the highest critical praise for any video game developer is the disassociation of his / her name from the company they work for (or own in some cases).  These people, the majority of which have seen success with both critics, and gamers alike.  These are our auteurs:

**Tim Schafer** (Double Fine): Schafer’s game’s often focus on mortality, satirical, or heightened take on our own.

**Will Wright** (Maxis): The king of simulation, but at the core of each of his games is life. 

**Ken Levine** (Irrational Games): Isolation, and fears.

**Fumito Ueda** (Team Ico): Ueda can best be described as a minimalist.  His games derive the bulk of their power not from fanciful visuals, but from narrative, and the characters that exist within it.  His games often focus on isolation, loneliness, and the lack of power against evil.

These designers, and Shigeru Miyamoto (among others) are all people who have been making creatively distinctive works within the video gaming industry for the entirety of their careers.  All of those names are instantly recognizable to any gamer with even the slightest bit of erudity.  These are people whom, among hearing of their plans to release a new game, we can immediately begin to form an idea of what sort of themes, messages, tone, and visual style will be contained within it.  

Unfortunately, the real question remains: does an auteur produce better work?  Should we actively be encouraging less involvement from the studio system in the development of our games and encourage the individual to put their own unique stamps on the products they oversee?

Well duh, chances are, barring some incredible luck, if he wants to have his vision translated onto the screen through a big-budget video game he's going to have to bend to the whims of the people funding said vision on a number of occasions throughout it's development.  This often results in games that shades of the original vision and, well, aren't really worth being proud of.  This is why we're currently seeing such an influx of indie developers.  A game like Braid could not have existed under the studio system.  It took Jonathan Blow sitting in his apartment for hours every day to create what is one of the most uncompromising artistic visions gamers have ever seen.  

So yes, more often than not, produce a higher calibre of art.  Auteur's are, for the most part, few and far between in the video games industry, but that will soon change.  As small, cheap indie projects continue to show that not only are they capable of producing great games, studios will take interest.  The typical video game auteur is currently by and large an unknown starving artist

Just an example: In a quest chain early in the game you get to decide if you want to kill the villain or rule the good people with the villain. That's a huge decision, but it's on the same hand pretty much the first in the game and took a good amount of 5 hours to get to.

That's the crux of the problem I was encountering with KoA. But it's not everything yet

I chose to level a rogue/mage combination

For a good amount of 20 hours I had a total of 3 attack spells in the mage tree and one passive envenom for my weapons in the rogue tree. In addition, there wasn't much variety in the way I could fight enemies. 40 hours later you get AoE spells in the mage tree and more passives+a smokebomb in the other.

Left click them with daggers or with chakrams? Right click them with lightning

Lastly I want to talk about the difficulty. I play on hard. It is a joke. The few times I died in my playtime are credited to my early encounters with groups of sprites who tend to swarm you and attack you one after another

* You can enter a fate-berzerk mode and deal approximately twice your damage and gain twice the XP

* Healthpotions have no cooldown. You can stock on them as much as you want and even drink them while you are stunned. There is an ability in the mage tree to heal yourself

* Blacksmithing in combination with Sagecrafting is much like in Skyrim with Enchanting completely overpowered. As min-maxing player

That's it. I had to get this off my chest. I will still finish the game since the story originally really interested me and had great poetry to it. What do you guys think about the game? Am I doing anything wrong or do you encounter the same problem as I did?

**tl;dr** KoA:R feels like a grind because the game has too much content without gaining variety. In addition: Generic quests,,False,,t5_2sgq6,True,,True
1322366951.0,mqj09,Work in video games,pizzapops,129,22,66,"I'm finding that as I get older I just don't want to put as much work into the video games that I play. Sometimes I don't have the will to put a lot of work into it or I just don't have the time. Sometimes I get home and I just want to mess around in a game world. In a game like GTA I might just drive around aimlessly looking for ramps to drive my car over.

I find that there's a very delicate balance of work and play in video games. It seems to me like most games require at least some level of work. In RTS games, you're building an empire from scratch which quite frankly takes a lot of work. And there are many other examples.

Sometimes I'll look at a new game and realize how much effort and work it'll take to figure out how to play and what to do or all the grinding that I'll have to do and it'll turn me off from playing the game. I might look at a game that I really enjoy

With respect to managing resources in games

I am finding that I am getting more and more reluctant to do quests or anything to progress the story and more time just messing around trying to stir up some shit or explore the world. I don't really care if the world is in peril and I need to act to save it. I would rather explore what's in that cave over there or what's over that hill. Sometimes I don't want to be told what to do and I am definitely finding myself playing more games that allow me to do whatever I want. 

There are a lot of games that are requiring their players to have to jump through hoops just to be able to unlock things. The Battlefield games require you to collect ""experience"" to unlock abilities and weapons. I feel that such a system for a shooter is completely unfair. It takes a new player a lot of work to get to the same level as older players because in order to become a somewhat decent player they have to spend hours trying to unlock med packs or defibrillators or ammo packs or whatever. This puts them at a severe disadvantage and makes the game a lot more laborious than it has to be. I can see a lot of new players being turned off by the prospect of having to spend so much time basically handicapped and for what? Of course I can see why the experience system can be popular. People like the sense of achievement and superiority it can bring. I

What are some of your thoughts on work in video games? What counts as play? What are some examples of work and play being well balanced within a game? Ideas for cutting down work in games? Is it always necessary to do some work to have some fun in a game? Is it necessary to have to spend hours grinding to unlock some weapon? If you love to grind

Edit:
This discussion is really great. I think a lot of you really get where I am coming from. Maybe we're at the same stage in our lives. We're more experienced and have a lot more going on in our lives than 10 or 15 years ago. 

Some people were asking my age. I'm 24 at the moment going on 25. I live a pretty busy life. I have less time usually to just sink into gaming than say 10 years ago. I think that factors into how I see games now. 

I used to have absolutely no problem sinking a ton of time into a game like EVE Online and figuring out how things worked and how to make a profit in game through a variety of different means or helping organize a group of people to get ready for battle against another group of players. Nowadays when I want to game, flanking the enemy and just going all out Rambo on the other team. If I need to do something else I can just put the game down right away and go do that other thing. 

Some of you mentioned how indie games are pushing the game-play envelope and I would have to agree. I have been enjoying a lot of great indie games lately just because of how unique they are. It's not the same dish as you get with most AAA titles. They are trying something very risky and in a lot of cases I would say that they are helping push the medium of gaming forward.

In other words

In order, Bad Company 2 XM8 Magnum, Bad Company 2 XM8 non-magnum.

Another thing to consider is that there is a difference between 'ideal' TTK and 'true' TTK.  Ideal Time to Kill is landing every bullet accurately and consecutively to result in the fastest possible kill.  True TTK is what happens when actually playing, spread, spread rate, ADS time, input lag, latency, netcode

Put simply: In Black Ops you kill people in three hits barring headshots.  It also happens that a three round burst in Black Ops is generally perfectly accurate.

In Bad Company 2 you kill people in six hits barring headshots, resulting in a 240ms + 120ms + 240ms = 600ms TTK starting from the first bullet to the last bullet.

What does this mean?  It means in non-hardcore mode, human reaction time is around 185ms for gamers.

Personally

+ &lt;160ms TTK = Extremely Slow Gameplay

+ 160ms - 400ms TKK = Moderately Fast Gameplay

+ 400ms - 600ms TKK = Moderately Slow Gameplay

+ 600ms TKK and above = Extremely Fast Gameplay

The first range results in slow gameplay because you cannot move without risking death.  If anyone has even the slightest situational advantage over you

The second range results in much faster gameplay because the TKK is slow enough so as to not be an automatic death sentence if you run around, then you can move target to target fast enough for killing multiple opponents.  The general result is that it is now possible basically prevent yourself from dying by killing your opponents.  It sounds silly, but the best string of kills happen by cutting a swath through your opponents and then slaughtering them when you're pushed up so far that they're not ready for you.  The entirety of the Call of Duty playstyle is based off of this TTK range.

I would argue that the 400 to 600ms TTK range actually slows down gameplay from the Call of Duty levels because it is much harder to down opponents as they move cover to cover.  This TTK range puts a large emphasis on headshots (good in my opinion)

Anything over 600ms I would argue drastically increases the speed of the gameplay because there is very little danger in moving quickly through a map.  Firefights are often not won through situational advantages, dodge, and to take small advantages and amplify them.  Think Quake.

1364463124.0,1b63cs,Reinventing the Square Wheel in Game Design,Provic,201,91,52,"One of the things that I've noticed over several years of playing games is many development houses have been repeating the same mistakes when implementing very common features or mechanics

The most common example I can think of as a case study is the Capture the Flag mechanic. It's appeared in almost every multiplayer game genre in some shape or form; there are games based entirely around the mechanic, there are at least hundreds and possibly thousands of games that implement it.

You see some variation of it in almost every competitive FPS, and I've even seen strange variants of it in racing games and RTSes.

It's also older than dirt. In the FPS sphere

So... why do we keep seeing the same flawed mechanics and the same awkward ""fix"" attempts? And I'm not referring to bugs and boring level design here, because if they don't use these fun-killing strategies, they'll end up losing because the other side will.

For instance, leading to a prolonged deadlock. It also encourages flag carriers to exploit any deficiencies in level design to hide themselves in an easily defensible area, whereas under normal circumstances these deficiencies wouldn't be a problem.

Scoring and reward structures are also often a problem. Many games dramatically under-value actually achieving the objectives in favor of individual PvP combat results. This means that the optimal point-scoring approach for players is to completely disregard the flag and treat the match as a glorified deathmatch. In any match where players aren't in a supervised group (like a clan or guild)

There are frequently issues with the environment/level design as well: central bottlenecks and poorly-placed respawn areas condemn players to an endless and tedious [defeat in detail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defeat_in_detail) when attacking unless they properly organize themselves, and the players aren't very good at it.

The problem is that almost all of these problems *have already been solved ages ago*. QuakeWorld Team Fortress had *exceptionally* solid Capture the Flag gameplay in **1996**. The canonical example is the well-known ""2Fort"" map which has been reproduced in essentially every Team Fortress-inspired game since. It handled respawning very cleanly, but not *required*. Even if most players were engaged in a perpetual melée in the middle, a small group from either team could still get through and extract the enemy flag.

The Unreal Tournament series also handled CTF quite well, which helped as well.

And yet no one seems to learn from this. Every time an MMORPG or new shooter gets released with a CTF mode

Some of the ""solutions"" to these complaints are mind-bogglingly terrible, and ultimately do little to restore any depth to the gameplay since the elephant in the room is overlooked (the huge unavoidable open area in the middle of the map, for instance).

So I've droned on and on about Capture the Flag and how people are terrible at implementing it, but fairly obvious historical solutions to common problems are overlooked. I'm not sure if this means that we should expect designers to have a more varied and eclectic background in gaming in general (so they would be more familiar with those existing solutions), or whether this is just something we're going to have to live with.",,False,,t5_2sgq6,,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/1b63cs/reinventing_the_square_wheel_in_game_design/

From the various discussions I've read about game DRM and piracy, at that) without knowing for sure if the game will work as advertised. On the developer side of things, PC game demos [have been in decline](http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2011/05/26/the-slow-strange-death-of-the-demo/) ever since the demo-disc-and-shareware golden era of the 1990s. Making a demo cuts into precious development resources and, executed improperly, could even cut into sales as people exploit the demo to turn it into a good approximation of the full product -- my younger self did so with the old 30-minute SimCity 2000 demo to sidestep the timer.

When Diablo III came out a few weeks ago, I was able to acquire a D3 guest pass, which authorized my Battle.net account to play the game through the first boss. Attempting to log into D3 with an account lacking this authorization results in a ""nope, you can't do that with this account"" message. This sort of online DRM gets a lot of flak, rightfully so in some cases.

To look at it from a different perspective though, in Diablo III's case, upgrading to the full version requires little more than plugging in your credit card number to authorize your account for all the content, and you get to retain the progress you made in the demo. With all this, players once again get to try out games before purchasing, while developers have to do little additional work to make a suitable demo and lower the hassle of buying the full game to almost nothing.

Perhaps we'll see more developers using online DRM systems to lure in new players? Thoughts?

1315537761.0,k9m04,A new model for truegaming.  Super long.  Sorry.,docjesus,155,48,81,"Hey everybody.

Real, though.  Brace yourselves, this is a long one.

Key point to think about throughout: we don't have link posts around here.  Only self.  Only text.  That means we essentially function not so much as a subreddit, but I want to turn it to our advantage.  I want to create a hybrid reddit/forum.  Keep this in mind, and let me know what you think of my proposal.

**Why We Can't Become Hypocrites**

What we want here is long, yes?  The problem is that if truegaming continues to grow, that's going to become harder to find.  Stricter moderation is usually considered the answer, but the harsh truth is that you can't claim to promote free speech, acceptance and understanding by introducing ever more specific rules into a system that's supposed to be democratic.  You simply can't.  We have upvotes and downvotes for a reason.

A lot of you might find this melodramatic, after all, srs business.  If you start a club, you have every right to determine who gets to be in it and what the rules are.  That's absolutely true.  On the other hand, I'm beginning to think that it's not enough to just talk about things.  You have to live them, every single day.  If I believe in a forum that can comfortably cater to most audiences while encouraging and standing for the things I'm passionate about, I can't be content with just talking about how it *should* be and getting pissed when it doesn't turn out that way.  What I'm getting at is that stricter moderation is the easy way out

So we can't ban posts while preaching tolerance

**Upvotes and downvotes.**

I know what you're thinking.  They don't work, will just upvote whatever they like.  That's just it, they only upvote *things they like*.  Not what they want to see on the front page.  They have no concern for the community.  This is not a bad thing!  It's kind of like going to a band's website to check tour dates without stopping by the forum, only they get their muddy footprints all over the new carpet when they do.

Commenters, if not more than, the links.  That's why they comment, to contribute.  Unfortunately, the number of people who vote far, far outweighs the commenters.  So we end up with this weird dynamic where everybody seems to hate the content but it keeps getting to the front page anyway.

This makes for pissed-off, but if the voters outweigh the commenters, how can we ever assume some form of limited democratic control?  How does voting help?

First of all

Second of all, causes the problems that reddit faces.  But we don't have to see it that way.

**A new model.**

I envision a system where the front page is not necessarily held in higher esteem than new.  New usually functions as the bottom of the barrel.  Plenty of people don't even go there because the content range is a lot wider.  Posts don't get seen so much, and more as one part of a two-part sorting system.  New is for quick moving, more common threads.  DAE like Morrowind?  Maybe you feel like chatting Morrowind for a while.  You might tell a story, strike up a brief conversation with someone over build types, spot a link for a cool mod you've never heard of.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  Everyone loves a little nostalgia trip from time to time, or to not be judged too harshly for their words.  Just some moreso than others.

So downvotes needn't be seen as a badge of failure.  They've simply been 'sorted' into another content category.  No matter how mercilessly downvoted it is, I don't really want it to be about something we talked about two days ago"".  It would be perfectly acceptable to leave a nice comment but downvote.

It's not expressing approval or disapproval:  it's like maintaining a library.  We're not judging the worth of the content but the categorisation.  And people are free to browse and comment on the 'new' category when they feel like shooting the shit casually over a game with the people of this community.  It's not a bad thing to do

**This sounds unsettlingly like 'effort'...**

What I'm asking is for the community's help to implement this change, judging its content and voting based on that, so I don't.  I'm not lazy, it's just an unreasonable demand to make of we creatures of convenience.

So what I've begun doing is voting only on content that *really* provokes me.  If I don't feel a strong feeling one way or the other after half a second, and I have to immediately think ""No, oh no, no fucking way, not this shit again, I am so sick and tired of these fucking jokes, I never want to watch Futurama again as long as I fucking live, I don't expect an immediate reward

**A typical hour on truegaming.**

* Becky goes to truegaming with the intent of finding something fresh to think about.
* Upon review of the front page, not this master race shit again, and downvotes it.
* She reads a couple of threads and comments, it wasn't *that* interesting.  She enjoys the discussion, but she would not be heartbroken if a similar thread didn't appear on her front page.
* Bored of long-winded treatises on the revolutionary-but-underappreciated mechanics of obscure Cave shooters
* This time
* Comments on a thread about Skyrim rumors.  Doesn't vote.
* Spots criticism of Braid's pretentious poetry, because she digs in-depth destruction of sacred cows.

That's how it would work.  No judgement, one slower-moving with more in-depth conversations and one more immediate, but both featuring exactly the same users.

If you made it through that, and I really think this could be an interesting new way to combat the faults that seem to plague every subreddit while not losing our freedom of choice.

Compare this to the [Double Fine Adventure Kickstarter](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/doublefine/double-fine-adventure), it's a higher priced lowest tier to get the product that the Kickstarter is for.

Watching the Kickstarter video and reading through what Ouya is, but as a product), that there will be more opportunities for products like this to emerge.

I view this is the first step into something that can change the landscape of console video games. And if you've ever tried anything new in your entire life

I think there are some glaring problems with Ouya

* First and foremost, I just don't get it. I think this project would benefit largely from a different name.
* I think the console is ugly looking. It does not have the Wow Factor or sleekness of Sony consoles or the compactness and simpleness of Nintendo consoles. I think simple is the way to go with lower-priced hardware. The design of the [Roku](http://www.roku.com/) is a great example of what I want out of something like this.
* How is the App Store on the device going to handled? From the perspective of a developer
* What are game purchases tied to? Are they tied to an account or the system? It is really important to me that there is a future planned out for this platform. It is hard to really say
* It seems far too early and far too high-level still to commit to this project. I want it to succeed and be awesome, conceptually, yet. Kickstarter projects and products need to be further along into development before asking for people's money.
* From the viewpoint of a developer
* Minecraft? Really? Minecraft is almost on every device that I own, but I am tired of Minecraft. I want to see some Real Titles on this machine. I want to see actual games running on it. Show me something that is exciting, not just words, renders, and pipe dreams.
* 100 USD for this piece of hardware is scary cheap. It seems far too cheap. Something seems weird about it all. I am all for affordable hardware
* The Kickstarter claims to be shooting for a March 2013 release of the console. That seems really, test it, manufacturer it, and get it to market by March 2013. I honestly expect this to be released Holiday 2013, as that seems far more realistic.

To me, I would love to have my games be played on the TV. It's a totally different feeling and mindset when playing on the TV versus a phone or computer.

However, that it is setup to succeed on some level. I can only hope it does.

From the Player side of me, I am unsure about how far this will go and who will actually support it.

**Gameplay Stuff**

Headcrabs are pretty annoying, crazy amount of pistol shots, etc. Even the grunts later in the game weren't as annoying as soldiers early on. The turret weapon UI wasn't that good either. If it just centered you or something, that'd be good, but sometimes you'd be shooting from almost across the screen and it was kinda annoying.

**Story Stuff**

I'm really on the fence about this. I've found that one can think of the story in two ways:

1) You have no idea what's going on. You take a full first person position Gordon Freeman, mysterious adventure just trying to survive/escape the facility. You don't even learn that much more at the very end of the game.

2) The story doesn't tell you anything. You're the player

At first I was leaning toward option 2 for the story, I played as Gordon and was just as confused as he, presumably, was. 

The other scientists trying to explain stuff to you was a nice way to try and fill the player in

**After-Thoughts**

I feel like the desire to play Half Life 2 really drove me to finish this game, I found to be much more fun. On a personal note, I don't like underground and/or water levels in most games, so it was really nice to hit the surface and then the other dimensions. Once you start getting near the surface was when the game started to get really exciting. You start praying that you hit the surface and learn what happened or everything works out, but it doesn't and it just makes for a more interesting latter half. I'm still a bit upset since nothing was really explained, I don't know who the hell that guy was at the end (although I do remember seeing him in a few other parts of the game), or what the hell the last boss was. 

Looking back on my 15 hours of play time (not sure if that's too short/long/just right), shit goes wrong, solve stuff and beat the boss. Even Portal played similarly 
in that the first game doesn't explain much but the second game answers a massive amount of questions

Bumping into a cheater or greifer in a multiplayer game is a very frustrating thing and as a 100% legit player

I cheated for a VERY breif time many years ago when Counter-Strike was young. I had some sort of an Ice hack that basically gave me x-ray vision. I had an Aimbot as well. After a few hours I was amazed to find out how god damn horrible I felt and I was also terrified of being banned since HalfLife was my life back then. Since then, why they do it, etc. So i'll lay out some questions that any hacker or cheater is welcome to answer. Some questions, there's no way to not sound like an asshole. I assure you i'm just curious and not trying to witch hunt.

* 1) What made you decide to start cheating? 

* 2) Do you consider yourself a good player? (do you feel as if you actually won the game when you come out on top?)

* 3) How do you feel about ruining the experience of the game for others?

* 4) What sort of obstacles do you have to get through in order to cheat but not get banned?

* 5) Assuming you're no stranger to cheating in multiple games

* 6) What is your stance on exploits? Some argue they aren't cheats since it's faulty game design that everyone can take advantage of.

* 7) Would you consider cheating something of an addiction? Is it difficult to go back to playing legit after being godlike?

That's all for now. I don't want to ask too much. If anyone would like to answer these I'd greatly appreciate it. I don't intend to spread hate about any of this and will gladly upvote anyone who takes the time to answer a few of those questions honestly.

1362314028.0,19kogd,Discussion: can lore improve the ability of a game to teach its gameplay mechanics?,Squidamus,146,44,31,"I had been wanting to jump into Dota2 for a while but found the learning curve difficult to fit in with my busy schedule

One of the things I found frustrating was the game's reluctance to explain mechanics that I later read were quite important during real PVP; in particular

I explain this in this feedback post [providing vital direction in an open-ended game through lore](http://dev.dota2.com/showthread.php?t=76637&amp;p=495512#post495512) and is as follows:

&gt;In Dota2 there are so many options, and things to learn, that it quickly becomes very overwhelming for new players starting to play the game. A very key issue in Dota2 that makes it difficult for a beginner to transition to comfortable online play is that there are far too many gameplay techniques that are assumed from player, but never specifically stated. a key example of this is last hitting. The tutorial mentions that a character only receives gold for last hits, but it does not adequately explain HOW to do this. It is difficult for a new player to adjust their playstyle if they do not know what they are doing wrong. It wasn't until I read online later that players should avoid (auto)hitting creeps until they are in low health, and THEN attack them (among other tips, such as animation length etc). This seemed strange and unintuitive

&gt;at first I thought 'last hitting' was just an outdated game mechanic but as I read further I realised it was an important element that adds to the metagame of competing for last hits against opponents. A possible explanation for this issue then, ie. how does the Dota2 fantasy lore explain why a player would receive gold for last hitting a creep? it doesn't. in fact it simply goes against intuitive logic to not effectively contribute to the demise of an enemy until the last second, but makes for a great gameplay mechanic, and so it isn't addressed. Unfortunately, this contradiction of gameplay and lore highlights a reluctance for the game to explicitly articulate and explain certain gameplay mechanics. This leads to an overall detrimental experience for new players, wherein there is a gap between the gameplay elements explained in the confines of the game's lore, and that of the deep metagame that must be searched for externally to the game. In the end, that must at some point utilise a variety of disparate resources and/or often dedicate a significant amount of unnecessary time

&gt;This issue is endemic to Dota2, given to heroes who break the spirits of opposing enemy organisms in this world? Would this enable the ideal environment for the explanation of an otherwise assumed or even hidden mechanic? Ideally, I would like to see Dota2 explain many of these 'unspoken rules' without restraint - such as the distribution of exp, or denying of creeps - and I think this can be done simply through the expansion of the game's lore and it's subsequently understood integration into the game's mechanics. For now however, the idea of utilising tutorial quests as a method to teach players gameplay mechanics, is a fantastic first step in the right direction towards shortening the unruly learning curve of Dota2.

what do you think? are there games where you feel the game is struggling or not trying to communicate key elements? to what extent should a player merely explore the mechanics and draw their own conclusions

------------------
**UPDATE**

You know what, and although Valve has seemingly added some background to the characters; an overarching story to a competitive title such as Dota2 is likely a silly premise.

I guess what I had really wanted to bring attention to was a way for certain games easily to 'break the fourth wall' and inform you of important/common gameplay elements that should be 'exploited'. while i agree that in most cases minor tactics are best just figured out by the player, then perhaps some kind of visible link that allows the player to relate to the *possibility* of a mechanic seems fair. even a short visible example of a hero waiting until a creep was on low health to last hit would suffice, so one could at least know that it was a viable thing to do.

An instance that comes to mind is a time when I was playing CS1.6 against a friend and I would occasionally be killed from a ridiculous distance. turns out he knew of certain walls he could shoot through and occasionally got lucky. I had never entertained the notion that doing that would even be possible.

A demo I received from the Playstation Underground (remember that?) many years ago threw me headlong into my first ""3D"" JRPG experience. That demo was Final Fantasy VII. It is no secret that Square had something great on their hands with FFVII. It helped pave the way for 3D console RPGs and truly set the bar in terms of quality. After the introduction of the 3D genre; JRPGs became the pinnacle of storytelling, and implementing the suspension of disbelief. They absorbed players into their fantasies and allowed them to freely utilize their imaginations. Unfortunately, with this current generation of consoles and gamers, these same defining characteristics are also proving to be their downfall. With that being said, this is where I begin to tear down the genre I so dearly love.

I'm just going to come out and say it; JRPGs have become practically intolerable for me to play through. I can't think of a JRPG (aside from Xenoblade Chronicles

First of all, set pieces, writing and the viewer’s emotional involvement or ability to empathize with the plight of the characters.

Many of these JRPGs can get some

It seems to be a trend in anime, during the first 20 minutes of the game it committed this faux pa twice. During a battle sequence where people were literally being gunned down a young character was complaining about having to fight and save lives. Then, a joke was made about taking a nap in the battlefield. It's annoying and completely destroys any immersion that was previously built. This isn't an example exclusive to FFXIII which I have picked on quite a bit, it's something prevalent in most, if not all JRPGs I have come across in recent memory. It just so happens that FFXIII or XIII-2 is the most relevant and recent case.

The inconsistent conveyance of emotion between characters in romantic situations, it may make you think ""I really hope no one is watching what I am playing right now."" Feelings of embarrassment or disgust for some may result.

When these are presented by themselves they can be worked around without too much issue. However, Lost Odyssey, Valkyria Chronicles or more recently Xenoblade Chronicles. It is obvious that Japanese game makers heed the cries from their fans because they are constantly improving traditional gameplay mechanics and at the very least I can say that FFXIII/XIII-2 had an excellent and inventive battle system, but they are completely overlooking the simple yet extremely important facets that define the quality of their games.

Major changes need to be made in these fields before JRPGs can once again be embraced by audiences outside of Japan. If not, NIS and Level 5 who consistently look to challenge the conventions of JRPG’s and game culture as a whole.

Edit: I find it funny that many of the popular comments are saying that I hate JRPGS. This is COMPLETELY to the contrary, but I can pride myself in saying that I have literally played hundreds since then. Name a JRPG since the NES and I have probably spent some time with it.

Many of you also said in different words that this is a WRPG circlejerk which it isn't as well. Did anyone actually read what I wrote? This is all opinion and observations that I've made and are in no way reflective of the ENTIRE genre. WRPGS aren't perfect just like JRPGs aren't, plot points and in many cases better gameplay too. That doesn't mean they don't share problems either. Many of them suffer from the same tired cliche's that you'll find everywhere. 

The videos included are extreme examples to my points and I am fully aware that they are extreme. I included them for the humor more than anything. 

The only thing I have left to say is... relax. This is just my opinion and observations that I have made. No need to get your panties in a bunch. Take it in stride and provide counter points to what I said. There's no need for snide and condescending comments like saying ""As an *ACTUAL* fan of JRPGs... blah blah.""

*Definitions:*

* A success factor is what determines whether you succeed in the game. Games' success factors rarely fall 100% into one category; the continuum *could* be visualized as a triangle

* Avatar Strength, weapon/unit unlocks etc.).    
The persistence is important
 (e.g. persistent: gear in WoW or D3; non-persistent: gear in DotA).

* Luck is where an advantage is given by random chance (e.g. lottery

* Player Strength (or Player Skill), memory, reaction, hand-eye-coordination, stress resistance  etc.

*Why the distinction is important to me (and I hope it might be to other people as well):*

**The different success factors address different tastes.**   

Here the example of mine:

I view games that rely overwhelmingly on Avatar Strength as timesinks, KoA etc.).

Games that have a large luck factor annoy me

I can tolerate a little bit of both factors

So let's say I've seen some gameplay footage and marketing blah blah of a new game and it appears to me that there is little to no luck factor and ~ 30/70 avatar/player strength.

My feeling's got nothing to do with the gameplay or the ""technical level"" of a game, capable of producing sounds we gamers haven't heard for over a decade.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eh2PXPZNEMs) Graphically, I suppose it's harder to put into words. Pixel was able to make a game clearly meant to look like an NES game, while doing things an NES game could never do. I think he understood how to create the illusion, though.  What I'd like is for more Pixels to step up, to set the trend and create a template for how to make a new, SNES-retro style game, or whatever.

Dead Island seems to have gotten a bad reputation due to its bad launch. I have seen people who haven't even played the game judge it as a buggy mess just because of that first error. For those who may have missed the initial days of the game, if any, sidequests. Despite the difficult launch, the game was put together quite well.

Visually, and chaotic. A lot of care has obviously been put into making them a believable setting after a zombie outbreak reaches critical mass. The zombies themselves look amazing, with a lot of variation in decomposition, missing tissue, body parts, injuries, fire damage, distinct setting to explore. Each one is drastically different from the last but still has the same attention to detail given to make them the same high quality.

Lastly, the attention to detail here is commendable: you can tear zombie tissue with bladed weapons, chop off limbs at different points so each time you hack off an appendage it doesn't always look the same. Blunt weapons can shatter bones and render limbs unusable, or be used to knock zombies over. This is actually a necessary tactic to win some fights against larger groups or special infected. 

The game has a Diablo-esque loot system with randomly spawned items from chests and enemies with varying levels of quality. Modding your weapons using scrounged up materials is surprisingly fun and adds new abilities and visual additions to your weapons. They look fun, collectables, and special weapons.

This was not meant to be a review of the game itself even though it may read like one so far. Whether you agree or disagree with my assessment above it should be at least plain that thought went into these decisions by the developers. Even if you did not enjoy a lot of the design decisions you can at the very least see that they had an idea that they worked toward and a concept that they pursued. The same cannot be said for the storytelling and writing. 

There are next to zero moments in the game that redeem this shortcoming. This is not a problem that is limited to Dead Island but rather many games in general. It's not as if this game tried to tell a story and failed, the game doesn't care that it doesn't make sense, and it's brought out at odd places and reluctantly spouts something at you to keep you playing as if the developers hated every minute of time they had to devote to it.

The story sequences are incoherent, at times, just make up new information on the spot as they go along. I would be surprised to find if a writer was even paid to produce the story sequences in this game. To clarify, the game wasn't trying for the ever elusive goal of ""so bad it's good"" or a b-movie parody. At points your characters are warped to different areas that aren't even connected on the map. They are just magically plopped down somewhere else with no narrative link. Some characters act on motives that have never been shown or explained, some act on events that don't even happen in the game or are just fabricated on the spot.

Examples (some spoilers

Very early on in the game you witness a plane crash over the island and it is heavily implied that it's due to the zombies. You find the wreckage later and explore it. There are zombies there

You help survivors early on in the game and then leave them to head into the city to find them food and other supplies. They contact you at points over a ham radio and remind you of the people that need your help. They mention things are getting worse and that some people are getting infected. A girl that was sick is mentioned and the survivors kill her before she even turns because they're afraid. You can travel back at any time and nothing is different. No one says anything different. This girl never even existed. She's literally not in the game.

""The Voice"", but you have to help him. It is heavily foreshadowed that he is lying to you and using you to his own ends, that he is fabricating the story about his infected wife that you need to find a vaccine for before he will get you off the island. At the end of the game you meet him after you have obtained the vaccine, and he was never lying at all. The wife is real, he was who he said he was, he did have a way off the island, then he inexplicably betrays you anyway and becomes the end boss. He is bitten by his wife near the end, which then transforms him into a huge zombie monster and you kill him. You take his helicopter

I can offer more examples about vanishing characters, I am only limiting it to these three because this post is already too damn long. If you want more, ask below. I could do this all day.

One redeemable story were the recordings left by a journalist scattered around the island. These were the only things in the game that were well-written, and acted as a stark contrast to how bad the rest of the story and writing was. I cared about the story of that guy more than every single other character combined.

This was not a rushed game. The quality of it in other areas proves that. I think a qualified writer could have patched up these issues with very little time,False,,t5_2sgq6,False,,,t3_kjcsw

Hi everyone.

Since 250(!) people have shown up in the past two days thanks to some word-of-mouth support, so if I'm repeating myself, I apologise, but feel free to reiterate any ideas you might have in this thread.

I used to get frustrated with r/gaming.  There wasn't enough of 'my' kind of content.  I watched threads come and go where people would complain about the state of the subreddit, install RES to filter out undesirable content, community needs to downvote more, stop complaining because it's not helping etc.  It grew tiresome, and no-one came away satisfied.

These threads existed because r/gaming had become enormous.  Almost 500,000 potential voters on your content.  Inevitably, people latch on to trends to secure greater amounts of karma.  This would lead to constant spikes in content based on the preferences of the average r/gaming user.  When groups are smaller, the average individual has a wider range of tastes.  When you reach half a million, it's practically a cultural force.  The cultural force of r/gaming was essentially a PC proponent who loves Valve, despises CoD and has a deep fondness for SNES-era RPGs, Pokémon and Zelda, so did the number of people discontent with the way their experience of r/gaming was changing.

There was no real solution to this problem.  There's no way that you could possibly control 500, hence successful subreddits for Starcraft and Minecraft.
Most of the time, because the only reason those pictures exist is to gain karma, and there is no karma in fledgling subreddits.  The best that might be hoped for is a brief interest in the alternative, before people start using r/gaming again for the posting of content.

What to do?  It seemed like the best solution was,000-strong community wants, and create a subreddit that encompassed ""everything else"".  So, as an experiment, I created r/truegaming.

It was my hope that, but without the opportunity for karma, so people get to talk about things without being buried under content that only exists to gain karma.  This is achieved by disabling links: if you want to talk about something that absolutely requires a reference, it can be put in the self post and hopefully the users will read it.  Also, we're currently insignificant in size, so even comment karma is pretty scarce.  Hopefully, the lack of link karma should keep the subreddit from getting too big.

As for the name: I've seen some concern that the name 'truegaming' is meant to be a dig at r/gaming, which sees itself as a Reddiquette-based version of reddit.com that frowns on karma-farming.  I had hoped that the name 'truegaming' would communicate all of that succintly, not to separate people or identify ourselves with some ideal of what a gamer should or should not be like.  I'll reiterate: truegaming is **not** in competition with gaming.  It is a companion subreddit to take the load off the default by providing a place for people to talk about games outside of the current/recurring trends.

Now, and it's time for it to go from 'empty room with an idea attached' to 'actual subreddit that provides content', and for it to do that, we need to talk about what you want from the subreddit.

I can't really provide ""proof"" of my assertion, which had a pretty good Tom Clancy style Spec Ops plot. It is complex, there are twists and turns and it all comes together fairly well. But that is generally all you hear about it: Splinter Cell is praised for its graphics and simple, intuitive stealth action, not for its story. Far Cry is another example. The plot is a pretty well done riff on Dr. Moreau, and does a pretty good job of pacing and what you can call ""plot escalation."" But all the reviews focused on graphics and gameplay, and the plot was easily dismissed.

I will give two examples of the latter, all Hell/Xen breaks loose, one person has to go through to close it. Add some tin foil hat nods with the government coverup, and you have a very basic, bare bones plot. Half Life 2 is much the same. I beat it again recently, and I still have trouble describing what, exactly, base gets attacked

But the games mentioned in the second are often praised for their storylines, which gave a sense of a world that exists outside the main plot (political troubles among the dwarves, for example). It then added a truly astounding level of extraneous detail through the various books and scrolls lying around. Both created worlds that the player exist in, rather than worlds that exist for the player.

So why does this matter? One, but in favor of setting. Gears of War had a clearly thought out story that absolutely nobody cares about because the setting only exists for the purpose of killing aliens. Two, setting is not something conveyed through cut scenes. A developer can spend a fortune on getting beautifully rendered, well acted cut scenes, but nobody will care without a good setting. A setting is something best conveyed organically while a player is in control. And three, we need freedom, but more importantly, but there is always a nice, I climbed to the top of mountains because they were there, does a fantastic job of balancing these.

But most importantly, need to start distinguishing between the two. Plot is a nice add on, setting is vital.

**1. Where the hell is my teammate?**

There isn't much to say about this one. If you have no idea what your teammates are doing half-the-time

**2. Hey

Like characters in a horror movie, players have learned that it's simply not worth the bother in most cases trying to follow teammates or trying to get teammates to follow them.

Perhaps the biggest reason no one ever sticks together is because quick deaths make it wasted effort. Nine times out of ten, two players moving together will spend most of their time trudging across the map only to end up with one player killed immediately in an ambush; so effectively, when the combat finally comes, teammates die too quickly most of the time to really fight together.

Mainly because of this endless quick-death/respawn cycle

**3. Action

However long it takes one person to think

Now this doesn't mean we can't have fast-action team play, action!', game design should always privilege 'pacing, pacing, pacing!'

**4. If one ball is fun

Looking at sports, defeating the whole idea of team play.

**5. If having ten players is fun

Similarly, looking at sports, we see that eleven or twelve players per team seems to be the upper limit. In fact, on the soccer field, half the players spend most of the time standing outside the zone of action waiting for the ball to get closer. So the sweet-spot seems to be about 3-6 players per side actively engaging each other around a local objective.

Notice I said ""local"" objective. Teams beyond the 11-12 player threshold can conceivably work coherently as long as strong mechanisms are in place to divide the team into smaller units, though, is that too many squads off doing their own thing eventually becomes as incoherent as a game of too many individual teammates off doing their own thing.

**6. You can't make me play medic! I'll do what I want!**

For role-based gameplay (such as class-based and/or vehicle-based combat)

DICE has not only gotten this consistently wrong, paper, scissors'* means that the game balance relies upon teammates competently covering the various roles, but their other mantra *'player freedom'* means DICE is not willing to take any necessary measures to make *'rock, paper, scissors'* actually work.

Now, but 'the guy who happened to spawn next to it at the right time' is not an acceptable answer. Likewise, 'Who must play medic?' is a difficult question, but 'no one' is not an acceptable answer.

**7. Nobody tells me what to do! I'll do what I want!**

So I've already asserted that players must be forced sometimes to play roles they don't want to, so mechanisms must exist that strongly incentivize the player to actually follow orders.

So where would players get their orders? Three possibilities:

* issued automatically by AI
* issued by a teammate in a command role
* issued by vote of the team/squad

Having the AI issue orders is least likely to trigger social unrest. On the other hand

If elevating certain players to privileged positions is too fraught with drama, your squad could pick its target by a vote for which flag to capture/defend (with perhaps seniority used to break ties); members of the squad would only be capable of capturing/defending the elected flag, making the vote meaningful rather than something players can ignore.

**8. Voice chat: the highest form of communication known to man.**

If you're like me, good headsets, and proper audio level balance for all players, it can be difficult to parse everything said or correctly identify who said what (especially in a team of many players).

To make voice chat more effective

To better supplement voice chat

Games also must be careful to make sure communication channels of all kinds don't devolve into spam. In several games

**9. Hats for sale! Someone stand on my head so I can get this achievement.**

Every time new items get released for TF2, *actually playing the game*.

Players also get distracted by achievements and character advancement. If I'm trying to get my 1000'th headshot to get an achievement or gun upgrade

**10. Hey

Some people like to join multiplayer games to *deliberately* Not Actually Play the Game. My favorite kind are the 10-year-olds who want to try the neat exploit they heard about from their friend's cousin who knows a guy who did it once before. 'Don't shoot those barrels! If I stack them in the right way

Others join games to grief

Whatever their reason for not actually playing the game, few games have figured out how to do vote kicks properly: rather than calling votes that expire, a vote to kick a player should persist indefinitely until a majority has voted to kick the same player.

**11. We won! I guess we killed more (or died less) than the other team.**

In a good, it's still better than just *'the winning team killed more (or died less)'*.

Teamwork is more than just the collective sum of our actions. If you and I are working together, a story of what *we* did together.

My interest in pop culture is pretty evenly divided between film and videogames and I've begun to notice an interesting trend in videogame story telling. 

There have been several games in the last few years (particularly AAA titles) that utilise some kind of reality bending level, Uncharted 3, Amnesia, Dishonered, Mass Effect 3, Bastion and F.E.A.R. but I'm sure there are games that I'm missing.

I'm not an expert on film or television or books but It seems that these other medium rarely if ever use these kinds of sequences in their stories. So much so that I have heard dream sequences being described as tacky

I understand that many games have perfectly reasonable dream sequences that are genuinely connected to the core game. [Like the poisoned water in Uncharted 3 or the haunted house in Amnesia](/spoiler). But it just as often seems like something shoehorned into the game for the spectacle or to gamify an otherwise normal activity [Like in Farcry 3 with the mushroom cave or the sex scene that was turned into a monster battle](/spoiler). Overall it just seems that the medium has a tendency to dissolve its own reality.

I was particularly bothered by mass effect 3 [using a dream sequence to get me to care about a child who died before I knew anything about him. I felt like they were using a dream manipulatively to stuff this character into my heart.](/spoiler)

In the game, simple, done. So then why am I having so much issue with this game? Why did I feel the otherworldly compulsion to snap my controller in half?

**Tedium and cheap shots.** The games boss fights are *tedious* beyond belief. I played on ""Hard"" initially (I typically do since most modern games are a bit too easy) so I'm not sure if it was a symptom of the difficulty level, you have to fire rockets a drop ship, and I must have fired at least 25 of the things while simultaneously killing aerial annoyances. My girlfriend asked me if I was done yet, since I had been playing the one section so long.

This extreme length with very little deviation leads to the *illusion* of difficulty. If it takes me longer to kill the boss, wearing me down until I finally made a mistake and got killed.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W1ZtBCpo0eU

The argument here is that if Quake were made today, ""all the other shooters that are out today,"" being linear, hand-guided, and lacking any trust in the player at all. But while I get the joke, I just don't agree 

First off, but so be it: if you are _only_ considering AAA titles when you talk about gaming today, then you are truly lacking in your world view, and unnecessarily limiting yourself for no good, valid reason.

I gather from the video that its primary point is that all shooters released today are linear, Call of Duty and its ilk feature linear single player levels and enforced invisible walls, but who _really_ buys those for the single-player campaigns? In these games, single-player modes really only exist to train the player in the mechanics, so they have a chance of competing the the multi-player arenas that are the actual focus of the games, and the reason 99% of the customers buy them.

On the indie market right now we have games like Hard Reset, just to take a quick glance at my own Steam collection. These games really catch that imaginary gauntlet and throw it right back down in defiance. Open stages to explore, simple introductions, difficult enemies, and a requirement for the player to play well from the very get-go, or fail miserably.

Even other big name games disprove this argument. Look at Borderlands, Crysis, Dead Island, and pretty much the entire Valve lineup, to name just a few. Each with complex, multi-path levels, mechanics that aren't unnecessarily complex

But let's also consider the fact that if Quake hadn't been made when it was made, taking actual history and evolution of the genre into account, if Quake were made today instead of over a decade ago, it would be more or less the same, only with better graphics.

In conclusion, direction-less, context-less deathmatch shooter.** Judging from the follow-up clips of what the creator thinks is ""good"" gaming, it seems that he's primarily just upset that bunny-hopping is no longer a valid tactic in games today.

1318524276.0,lazeb,Moral complexity in games ....,duketime,118,17,131,"In short

Bioshock, I understand there's a choice to be made, but it's not a ""moral"" choice so much as it's an incentive choice: whether you wanted more Adam upfront (and overall) for being a bad guy, or you were willing to take less Adam (and later) but get some other upgrades for being a decent fellow.

And that's pretty much it. In most any game I've played with ""moral decisions"" to be made it's essentially ""you can get more in-game currency for being a jerk or you'll get something less fungible but neat if you're a good guy"". And there's no moral dilemma ... it's what you want more. Especially when the dilemmas are so cut and dry: if you harvest you know you're being a jerk ... you know the ""right"" thing to do for the ""good"" ending

And now it's disappointing because all games (especially the RPG sorts) seem to think it's necessary to include this level of morality, Fable, etc. Either take the obvious high-road and reap such and such benefits, or do the obviously evil (or renegade, etc.) thing and claim those rewards and consequences.

Other issues:

* This sort of game design sort of exclusively rewards polarization. You can do quite well as the bad guy
* The actual consequences of being good and evil are typically nominal. Often (as I said above) the reward structure is different: evil gets more sooner, Shepherd *looks* all evil. Oh my Fable character is all fat and dark looking (but can run just as fast as a svelte character). Oh the city's all run-down. Wow, the city looks nice. Oh, I can only sell my stuff to the black market guy or the upstanding businessman. Etc. All changes are (in practical terms) typically minor, non-gamebreaking, and often cosmetic.

Look, lasting consequences would be immensely hard to develop simply because you will have to account for the case in which the player *does* kill the crucial NPC (the solution is often to account for it in a trivial way, like I say above: the player lets the town go to pot, but the vendors and key NPCs are still hanging around ... nothing's really different from the ""good"" scenario).

I don't want to turn into Roger Ebert, the moral complexity is almost always just not there. For the record, though, I do think games can have moral meaning, it just tends to occur, really, during the narrative portions of the games.

Pretty old spoilers here:

The meta-/fourth-wall breaking reveal in Bioshock was legitimately pretty-mindblowing (and, and the final section of Braid where you are literally just holding down the time-reverse button has significant narrative weight. Of course, as I point out, both of these are narrative tricks and both explicitly not involving character interaction, pretty much.

I enjoyed Assassins Creed (the first one) quite a bit when it came out

Then a couple years later Demons Souls came out and it was one of the best gaming experiences I ever had. Everything about the game was solid. And for some reason I started thinking about AC again. I realized that it was the context-sensitive controls in AC that had gotten to me, using an herb always took the same amount of time. It just worked.

So

In Prototype there was a race that required you to jump away from a tower towards the end and fall to get a high score but I couldn't figure out how to do that. Every time I tried to jump off the building my character would jump higher, and I was only a couple missions away from the end of the game too.

Dark Souls came out and they made one control context sensitive - in order to jump you have to be running. I hated this change. It was the only control across the two games that I felt was unreliable.

And finally AC3 came out recently. I enjoyed the game, etc. But I don't feel like I mastered the game in any way, shape, or form. I don't feel like I was playing the game so much as I was kind of guiding the game along and hoping for the results I wanted. There was one mission where all I needed was for my character to jump ahead of himself onto a rail, but I was only able to do that two times out of about 20 tries. The rest of the time he wouldn't jump to the rail, or he'd jump down onto someone below him. 

All of this sounds negative, swing, block swing, spell, etc. etc. Compare that to some of the crazy shit you can do in the AC games and one of them is definately more visually entertaining.

So I like the options and the entertainment that context sensitive controls allow for

But what if, and expensive for the player to do in terms of expending ammo/health-kits and of little direct reward, 2) was obviously neutral, and 3) was only somewhat difficult and very rewarding.

I was convinced I had worked out the plot of ME before the third instalment and was severely disappointed that it didn’t match up with the narrative I’d expected 

1) Reaper procreation: Reaper’s spent the entire second game using the collectors to get human DNA in order to essentially create a human/reaper hybrid. This is essentially reproducing in the same way Asari do. If Bioware had run with that idea then the main plot would have been essentially a gigantic rape attempt… a little creepy I know.

2) Ardat-Yakshi : Building upon this Asari comparison I thought they had been included entirely as a parallel to the way reapers would reproduce since it wouldn’t fit the norms of any form of reproduction and evolution we would be familiar with. Ardat-Yaksi were even more akin to reaper’s I had thought

3) Cosmic imperative: The ‘cosmic imperative’ as Javik describes it (to those of you willing to fork out £10) controls all things… natural selection would certainly have influenced reaper evolution perhaps leaving them with the mentality of extreme malice that they have, as with life, become the goal simply because that is most likely to allow another generation to survive. The Reapers would allow evolution to take its course to a certain extent until they would sweep in murdering organics and using the genetic data to update and evolve themselves just because that is what nature favours.

Here is what I had imagined the ending(s) would be:

A renegade Shepard would have that preordained-by-evolution mentality of survival at any cost

I looked at the previous runthrough as a terrible anxiety nightmare that told this new recruit that he needed to hold back.  And the game played great for me.  The game was not afraid of cutting out entire branches, plot points, and characters if you decide to do some other thing instead.  It was not afraid of letting the player make mistakes.

In Mass Effect, and the choice between [Ashley and Kaiden](/spoiler) was easy [(Max Shepard and Ash were an item at the time)](/spoiler).    And say what you will about how wooden Kaiden was (he was), the completionist in me went to see him all the time.  [So when the elevator opened up and he wasn't there, I *""felt** that absence.](/spoiler)

In Mass Effect 2, but one thing happened when I arrived at the final mission: [I watched Yoeman Chambers die](/spoiler).  In a similar mechanic to the above situation with [Kaiden](/spoiler), this was a character that Shep would talk to on a regular basis, [and the perfect choice to show what it means to lose half a crew](/spoiler).  Why?  I was fucking late.  I was busy doing side missions, when the time limit came up, and I had one loyalty mission left.  This mission?  Well it just about resolved everything from the first game.  [I'm talking about Legion](/spoiler).  The consequences of not doing this would be astronomical, and so there was no choice in the matter for Max, now it's hard for me to continue as Max

That being said, there weren't many which represented these choices.  Those two are the shining examples of feeling consequence.  

Mass Effect will explicitly tell you what a consequence might or might not be.  For the most part the moral dilemmas amount to either adopting or shooting a puppy.

Alpha Protocol locks you out of portions of the game if you chose a certain route.  Mike cannot backtrack and try to do it another way.  Once a mission is done the way its done

Deus Ex represents consequence without explicitly telling you that you were going to miss out on something.  It requires Adam to improvise from now

In Mass Effect I found myself, and I prefer not to do that.  Playing with systems rather than people, the actual choices in game seemed forced and inconsequential in the larger scheme of things (particularly the romance choices).  Max felt like someone I created, but the story felt forced upon him, like he was just along for the ride, with some control here in there.

In Alpha Protocol, I could switch it up for Mike from time to time, but Mike was someone I played as, not someone I created.  

In Deus Ex: HR, it's a violent world and life is cheap.  I feel like I'm playing Adam Jensen the Security specialist / corporate hit-man.  Even though some are playing like Adam Jensen the serial killer or Adam Jensen the pacifistic ghost, or even Adam Jensen the commando, Adam Jensen still feels like a fully realized character partially created by both the player and the developers.

1352352463.0,12udkv,Halo 4: an honest discussion. ,BLUYear,141,47,212,"It's been a couple of days since the, that it is worth the buy and has been given an ample amount of praise. Metacritic isn't the best factor to truly evaluate a game but it seems that many are rather down on the game and as a person who likes to know what both worlds think I'm a bit stuck on how to truly feel about how others feel. I'd like to know the honest opinions of those of you in /r/truegaming that have purchased the game and have played it through or at least have done enough to have a good take on the experience as a whole. God knows I can't go to /r/gaming for this. 

Personally I think the game is rather fantastic, which is something I hope they continue to do with the following entries. Some things do dangle a bit, with it being rather similar in plot to the other games in the sense that most deal with a larger than life alien weapon that is about to be used for nefarious deeds and Chief must stop them at all cost. The supporting roles here are fun to watch but aren't that well fleshed, though Lasky does have a full on mini movie to his own, which makes him perhaps one of the better characters yet so far. Some minor things like why the Covenant is still the enemy and the lack of truly using the main antagonist to what I thought would have been fantastic showdowns do detract from what I think is an extremely solid effort that deserves to be recognized. 

Sound design is gorgeous and the score is an understandable evolution of the Halo score. I do miss the drums and high intensity of beats that liters the past installments but it more than does the job of immersing a sense of awe. Visually it pushes the limit of what the 360 can do with no detraction on it's performance and its Pre-rendered cut-scenes are some of the best yet developed that I have seen. Some low rez textures and pop ins here and there but nothing major and the frame-rate never dipped during my playthrough, depth and coloring all play a substantial role that just makes the game team with vibrant life. 

The gameplay is still Halo, horrible word) and has a good rhythm to it, especially in online where the connection is excellent, with some great map design and creativity thrown in. The perks and loudouts seem to integrate well enough without ever seeming as an intruding element from another FPS camp. 

Campaign is solid with some fun missions and is of a good length. Variety is a bit lacking in terms of objectives and the level layout may be lackluster at points which do hamper the pace of the game

Special mention the modes of Spartan Ops. It's a fun mode with some great potential that promises a long continuation after the endgame.

Weapon wise I think I am a bit at a loss. They are all fun to use but some seem to be reskined designs of others wit h little variation apart from rate of fire. But I'm not that good at judging this aspect of games so I leave that up to more adept people.

So holy shitballs did I not see this coming. After I finished spec ops I immediately went online to read others thoughts on it. The two leading interpretations of the ending are that either A) walker has been crazy the entire time and most of what you've seen is imaginary or B) walker died in the helicopter crash and is in purgatory (or hell). I have a different interpretation which I think is underrepresented in the discussion.

**No part of the game is meant to be taken literally.**

It is from beginning to end a meta play being put on for the player commenting on such games. The game is not a narrative story but a conversation being held between the creator and the player that takes the form of a modern warfare game.

Everyone seems to touch on the meta aspects of the game

**The story makes no real world sense and that is the point.**

Your initial mission is to go in, your mission should be over as you immediately find survivors and should leave. The fact that you do not would not make sense in the real world however in game logic it makes so much sense that it doesn't merit conscious thought. In a video game you move forward and kill things. Of course you move forward, what else would you do? When all you have is a hammer every problem looks like a nail and when all a game lets you do is shoot things than obviously the solution to the problem here is to murder people until everything is better. Even the moral choices in the game are expressed exclusively through you choosing who to shoot or not shoot.

Soon after you discover that the 33rd is hostel. Presumably you have been briefed and at this point know that there are about 1000 soldiers in the 33rd. Here your decision to not turn back goes from being unwise by real world standards to being idiotic to the point that no actual human would do it. There is not a form of ptsd or psychosis that would manifest itself in this manner

A full list of times that delta team should have left and radioed for help would read like a full plot synopsis of the game but the most notable is the white phosphorus scene.

**Spec ops is a survival horror game where you are the scary monster**

Spec ops is something that shouldn’t have to exist but does; an indictment of the idea that the world’s problems should be solved by a wisecracking team of nigh invulnerable American super men committing small scale genocide.

Walker insists that launching the white phosphorus is the only option, you have to fire the phosphorus any way. This is because Walker is not you, he is a monster that the developers made in criticism of you. You are meant to be afraid of what you are going to do.

**The increasingly poor decisions of delta team.**

For the rest of the game you basically know how badly everything is going to end. I don’t think anyone thought the water caper was going to end well, but given the fore knowledge of it’s crash it’s kind of hard to see how it wasn’t the worst idea ever. In many video games you save the world by indiscriminately killing every biped in front of you, so obviously that is how you help the people of Dubai.

**Konrad is the developer**

Konrad is named after the author of Heart of Darkness. Not a character from it. Not an actor from the movie. The author

There is almost nothing that konrad says that can not be interpreted as the developer talking directly to you. When you walk in he is painting the white phosphorus scene, or gone home, ""stopped"". If you didn't like what you where doing you should have stopped but you kept going because it was engrossing or interesting or fun.

Here the video gamey-ness breaks down. The real konrad is dead because in real life if a soldier went missing for 6 months in a disaster zone they’re almost certainly dead. The prisoner sniper execution thing wasn't real because that’s the kind of bullshit that only happens in video games.

Now the developers have shown you all they wish to and do the video game thing. Give you a choice of how it ends. A “good ending” or a “bad ending”. But like all the hallucinations it fades to white instead of black. Because none of this is real

This would be my outro but I've already written too many fucking words. What do ya’ll think of spec ops? How do you interpret it?

# **The History**

So we have this game company called Camelot Software Planning

[Hooray for brand recognition](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/f/fa/Mario_Tennis_box.jpg)

However, during the next 6 years, they began to hunker down and think about their next RPG game. And it went through several different iterations.

[This cluttered screen was only the least of its problems](http://img.gamefaqs.net/screens/8/c/5/gfs_41786_2_58.jpg)

First, Camelot decided to shift focus to the up-and-coming Gameboy Advance. Second, the proposed game was so large that it couldn't fit onto a single cartridge, forcing Camelot to split the game into two parts. Thus, we come to its finalized forms, **Golden Sun** and **Golden Sun: The Lost Age**.

-----

# **The Gem**

This was a really well designed game. The game holds up really, really good.

Really.

Ok, is based around an ability called *Psynergy* (sin-er-gee? si-ner-gee? Goddamit), a psychic, earth-wind-fire-water-based ability controlled by people called Adepts. You defeat enemies by using Psynergy. You solve puzzles by manipulating the environment using Psynergy. You save the world from collapsing by manipulating Psynergy at the Elemental Lighthouses. It's a very consistent experience that, coupled with its beautiful ancient-Mediterranean/Asiatic-inspired artwork and memorable soundtrack, makes it a really immersive game.

[Well

Another key component of Psynergy are these cute little creatures called Djinni, but their main usage is their ability to be equipped and change your characters into different classes. And the classes are amazingly varied. Some range from powerfully hard-hitting characters (Ronin and Chaos Lord) to amazing healing/Psynergy based characters (Pure Mage and Ranger). **The Lost Age** mixes this up a bit by adding item-based, gimmicky classes (Beast Tamer, Harlequin, and Necromancer) that require equipping specific items. What class you choose will ultimately determine your battles.

[So cute

Thus we come to the final facet of this amazing gem: the battle system. The battles themselves are really standard RPG fare. You start each turn by giving your commands

* You can save your PP and use your weapon

* You can use powerful Psynergy
 
* You can use Djinn in battle to unleash powerful attacks or buffs

* Using Djinn allows you to get them ready for a really powerful Summon attack

* Even the items serve as frugal alternatives to actions

This give and take system really changes up the turn-based battles

&gt; `It was not very effective...`

you are given a message like 

&gt; `Wimpy Bat took 36 dmg!!`

where the ending punctuation simply lets you know how effective that move was. And if the move was super effective *and* kills the enemy

[Man

As you got further into the game

[FUCK](http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20080217045148/goldensun/images/2/2b/DjinnStorm.png)

One last bonus of this game is that there is a Colisseum option you could choose where you can test out different party arrangements or just beat up monsters and even bosses. And since it's not part of the game, though, you could only use three characters instead of the usual four).

There are other smaller

* You can read the mind of almost EVERY NPC

* You can save ANYWHERE

* Your PP heals naturally by walking around


-----

# **The Shit**

Ok

Then there is this scenario:

&gt; `Isaac and Felix target the same wimpy bat.`

&gt; `Isaac beats the shit out of the wimpy bat with Megiddo.`

&gt; `Felix then

Another annoyance comes from the fact that **GS** erects a big juicy wall at the end of the game, a shame that is compounded when you sail by those areas in your flying ship.

The World Map is also way too large and boring. Most of the time you'll just be traveling across the same, so it can get pretty easy to get lost on the winding road, which I found pretty funny since the game world is essentially linear. Even when you get the ability to sail across the seas, the *ocean* is way too huge, ironically. See, sailing works in a game like **Windwaker** because there are a lot of little events or areas to explore in the big deep blue, but in **Golden Sun**, so it gets really boring and really ploddy.

[Funnily enough, the world of Weyard looks really familiar somehow...](http://www.freewebs.com/goldensun_warrior/040419174035.jpg)

Even the Psynergy used for puzzles lends to the linear build of the game. It just feels too contextual. You can only create climbeable vines if you stand in front of a sprout, making things rather tedious. There's just a general lack of interactivity with the environment,  which is disappointing when Psynergy itself is supposed to be an ability to manipulate the environment at will. Maybe if they did it more like how you make your ship fly, where you can sustain the effect at the cost of draining PP, it would've felt more natural.

[I mean

But the worst of the problems come in the form of the games' cutscenes. Or rather, did Camelot compensate with dialogue. Even pressing the A button to speed things along doesn't speed up characters nodding their heads or slowly plodding their way across the screen. And you get no interaction. The main protagonist of both games are mute, so they really only take part in conversations with simple ""Yes"" or ""No"" confirmations, neither of which affect the conversation in any way.

[I guess he got traumatized by this guy](http://tartarus.rpgclassics.com/goldensungba/images/startgame/golden15.png)

I did have fun the first few days but immediately it began to get a little stale. Now I haven't touched it in weeks. And its not like I'm not a fan of the genre, the biggest was that the gameplay just wasn't cutting it. 

With BC2, for example, could have people in A sniping someone out in B and all the action centered around that area. In BC2, the small yet well-separated hotspots of action was the thing that made it exciting. That's why after two years I still play every once in a while and enjoy the maps, even if I've played on them hundreds of times. The team play is still solid due to the layout of things. If you are losing, at least you know its because the other team was actually better, not because you're a disorganized mess. Or maybe the community is just full of people who actually want to be there? I really don't know. 

I just can't pin-point it. The other thing that worries me is the new explosion of TWENTY fucking extra DLC maps. A good game can stay fresh and new for years on just a handful of maps *if they're well designed*.

Obviously I'm far from alone in noticing this trend in both reviews and games. This is part of the basis for the complaint that gaming is too violent. There's been a lot of talk from a lot of different people about how gaming's stories are held back by the sheer amount of deaths involved in completing most major games. Even Mario kills an untold number of Goombas on his way to saving the princess.

Most people seem to focus on a need to change how we build games

NCEs are any game objects which you defeat which don't effectively exist in the story. They are the hundreds of police officers in Bioshock Infinite or the legions of bandits in Borderlands. As a group they have a justification for existing, and no place in the story. Similar NCEs exist in pretty much every game.

The idea I'm slowly working my way around to is that perhaps the solution is to find ways to highlight which objects (I hesitate to call them 'people' even if a specific NCE appears human) are purely there to provide challenge in the game *without* breaking immersion. And that's the key bit: Not breaking immersion. Many of us are able to unconsciously ignore mass bloodshed of NCEs because we've gotten used to it. New gamers are put off by it because they haven't.

So ultimately that's the problem that (in my opinion) needs solving: A way to make it obvious that a given 'person' is actually a NCE without breaking immersion.

I think I've rambled for long enough. What are your thoughts on the matter? Is this even a problem? Should we even have NCEs in the first place? (How) Should we represent them in game?

For those of you who haven't heard, the player.

Ultimately, really drilling deep into the secrets of the town.  At the start you pick one of three healers, and the two you don't choose become NPCs (and you don't completely know where you stand with them).  You only experience one side of the story with each playthrough.

I went on and played another game by these developers, beautiful and virtually impenetrable game.  In the game you play as a soul drifting in purgatory.  The world of *The Void* has been drained of colour, and colour is constantly draining out of you… you need to constantly scavenge for colour to stay alive.

1) **Not being afraid of complexity**.  Instead of opening with a basic tutorial level and introducing gameplay elements gradually

There's always an immediate threat, however, everything clicked into place.  I suddenly knew what each character represented, and what the goal of the game was.  I even realised that the tutorial lied to me.

2) **Disempowerment and exploring negative emotion**.  These games, rely on taking control away from the player.  The atmosphere of the game-world and its mechanics work together to explore negative emotions: not just fear, but hopelessness, depression, fatigue etc.  *Pathologic* left me physically drained at the end of each session, but so did reading ""1984""--both were interesting experiences.

Now simply mentioning pubbing campaigns in L4D2 will yield a diverse set of responses.  Some will laugh at you

My main observation is that pubbing a campaign in L4D goes hand in hand with the very foundation of the game: 4 strangers relying on each other to survive a zombie apocalypse.  To me the appeal comes from the different types of players you are paired with.  Now don’t get me wrong.  Sometimes you get teamed with griefers but I don’t consider them players and hence are not in the scope of this thread.  Man I hate griefers.

I’m sure everyone can name the types of people they are teamed up with.  Sprinters. Clueless.  Rambo.  Slow Pokes.  Item Whores.  The list goes on.  The challenge (and thus the appeal…for me) is dealing with these less than desirable strangers and make it all work regardless…survive the campaign.

The fascinating part comes from the transformation my teammates and I go through over the course of the 4-5 maps.  During the first map I am almost always convinced that I am teamed with 3 retards.  So I simply follow and observe.  By the second map there has usually been at least one reckoning of sorts.  What I mean by that is there is a moment in the game where someone either deliberately helps another teammate or deliberately abandons them.  Not only will everyone’s opinion shift

Being saved by the guy you thought would only run ahead changes your entire perception of how you should treat that person (usually…obviously there are exceptions to everything I am saying).  More than that

By the 3rd map everyone has a pretty good idea of what they can expect from their teammates: their strengths

Let me tell you something.  Beating a campaign on expert with a bunch of friends you know well is satisfying.  Beating a campaign on expert

With all that said there is also a huge patience factor involved that is not common for every player in every game.  Not everyone is willing to restart the first level 4 times before finding your stride…not even me.  That doesn’t change the sense of reward I have experienced by dragging a group of misfits through to the very end (or being dragged myself for that matter).  I recommend everyone give it another try.  Helping out a jerk several times to see them transform into the team player is just an achievement in and of itself

1330066637.0,q3s4x,"Skipping combat, why not? Or in other words, why gate content anymore?",sonofafinch,148,154

On the subject of skipping combat, why can't we skip past combat sections as well? 

Before attacking that position on the basis that combat is the crux of all gameplay

If you look at the upcoming Mass Effect 3

* ""RPG mode""
* ""Story mode"" basically tunes combat down to trivial (but not skippable) while retaining the dialogue choices of the game. 
* ""Action mode"" basically boils down any dialogue choice to an automatic pick and plays it as if it were a cutscene; combat difficulty is still adjustable here.

Of course

This also touches on the concept of why have an ""easy""/casual difficulty mode. I'll almost never even consider turning down the difficulty but I can see why those less comfortable with playing video games would want to have the option. Easy difficulty should not be a stigma even amongst hardcore gamers simply because it wasn't intended for them anyway.

Combat though

* The dialogue / choice &amp; consequence systems were arguably the true gameplay of Alpha Protocol. Decisions you made in dialogue might only reveal their consequences much later on

* There are plenty moments where a mission is just dialogue (or combat-free) or simply not your typical traverse-environment/engage-in-combat scenario such as [the Gelato Shop in Rome](/spoiler), etc.). The latter can also happen during ""regular"" missions.

* It can be argued the combat in the game just plain sucks (from a TPS standpoint) which is why it turned off so many people (though the combat is fun/satisfactory from an RPG standpoint); if it could be skippable (besides requiring you do do any choice &amp; consequence-based decisions during the mission) it might have been easier for some people to pick up if the combat turned them off.

(Another fine example is Planescape: Torment where everyone you ask will advise you to invest all your points in INT and WIS and avoid getting into combat/talk yourself out of it.)


Lastly, movies, and albums don't *punish* you for not being good enough at reading/watching/listening to it, so why should games? You can skip chapters on DVDs or you can flip to the middle or end of a book, so why can't we also choose where to start playing the game instead of being forced to start from the beginning?

Soul Calibur V does a lot I like, but it's overall a definite improvement.


I definitely understand the removal of parry and implementation of just guard in order to raise the skill cap. However with most of my friends being casual players it's just increased the gap between us. What was previously closish battles with parrying on both sides has become more of a slaughter as I'm the only one pulling off GIs and JGs (some of my friends even eschew the sticks for a controller


Which brings me to my annoyances. I far prefer local play and so skill difference is always an issue. In the past playing with different health was rarely a solution as it becomes a case of either they win by getting 3 hits in or I have to essentially perfect them. However we did always used to play at 200% health for longer more rewarding battles. There is no option for this for the first time I can remember!?!? Why remove such an effortless thing to implement!?


So we used to find balancing skill was far more fun using Team Battle


You also can't make the time limit larger than 60 seconds, bluffing standing off whilst verbally beckoning the other player to try to rush them... now it's almost a race against the clock, even at only 100% health.


The entire game seems centred around online multiplayer


Now I understand it's a creative choice to remove characters, Zasalamel and Setsuka seems odd to me, due to the fact they were rather unique characters. I didn't enjoy the latter two, but Talim has been a favourite of our group for some time, and her absence is sorely felt.


But removing a lot of these other features I've mentioned seems absurd, they tend to just release a game and leave it until the sequel. However a guy can be optimistic...

**TL;DR: Project Soul has done a good job of fine tuning the gameplay

EDIT: *IS* there actually any kind of direct line to developers the way we have with American/European ones through forums (or even crash on the BF3 subreddit)?

I bought the Jak and Daxter collection about a month ago, now that school was over.

A couple of weeks later

The first game was honestly my favorite. The level design was gorgeous, and fair, for the most part. I had a great time exploring the world and collecting the orbs.

The second game was where I saw things begin to deteriorate.

The new settings and characters and all that jazz I was okay with. It was the open world that really got me. Because it really wasn't open! Jak II was the first game where I've ever been stuck in traffic. With GTA there's enough open space to be able to maneuver myself around pedestrians and other vehicles. The small lanes and lack of things to do made moving from mission to mission in Jak II a chore. The combat was also improved a bit, and I suppose my expectations were not where they should have been, because this was a drastic departure.

Thankfully, but I wasn't enjoying myself all the way through.

Mobile gaming has been redirected a bit with the advent of the smartphone and it's $1 - $5 games. Even PC gaming

But I think this is probably the first of many changes we'll see in the industry. End of 2012 saw the release of Nintendo's Wii U, and desktop and TV gaming respectively.

I read this article about the new Fire Emblem's ""support conversation"" system. It honestly sounds really cool. I haven't heard any complete explanations so far of what it offers

It's basically a system of talking after battle that allows you to form bonds with the other characters in the game. Add that with this game's permadeath and if you ask me

The reason I'm so interested in this is because just a few days ago I was thinking about how fans of XCOM like to talk about how much the game offers the players a story for each one of their soldiers. [e.g. My Sergeant Jones died in combat

These stories sounded really cool, that got me to thinking about a game where the characters aren't just famous for what they did in battle, but also have backstories, which further empowers what they do in battle and your feelings when they die. I was also thinking about character relationships as well and chemistry that you can build between characters by putting them together. I was also thinking about programming a game where I could experiment with these ideas.

Then, my idea, in Fire Emblem: Awakening. In that game, you can build up relationships, have kids that can soon fight alongside you, gain perks from relationships, etc.  That's when I got excited. This could re-invent the way a lot of game plots are done if it's done right. 

Maybe I could be exaggerating, while everyone has their own unique back-story? This is just fantastic to me. Does anybody else feel the same way about this? Any thoughts about what you believe they should add? Or what should be excluded?

For example

Why is that?

Several points indicate that this hostility stems from and is inherent to the genre

Things about your generic MOBA:

1. It is an online PVP game so the main point is to be better than other people.  
2. Usually a global rating is present
3. It is real time and quite fast-paced
4. Despite the fast pace
5. There's a huge amount of caveats that are not obvious to a newbie but incredibly important. Example: lasthitting instead of pushing. For those who do not play DotA clones: It's a tug-o-war. In order to win the game, that is called pushing. Pulling the tug. However, early on you should NOT pull the tug for a lot of reasons, and if you pull the tug and the enemy doesn't, they win. It makes no sense until you understand the reasons, and that takes practice.
6. There's an emphasis on teamplay
7. Seriously
8. Due to [Dunning-Kruger effect](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect) nobody will ever understand that they are the millstone on their team, that the team's loss is, more or less, [a result of their mistakes snowballing into a giant ball of misery](http://www.nerfnow.com/comic/717).  
9. Due to how the genre works (half a minute of action followed by minutes of waiting) you always have plenty of time to tell other players all the ways in which they suck.
10. Due to how popular the competitive scene is, disregarding the situation, and flame their teammates when they do not follow cookie cutter strategies. Note that for a new player there is no way to distinguish between something that is just popular or something that is popular because it's actually a good choice.

TL;DR We have a genre where, you can lose without actually it being your fault (although you can't tell if it's truly so, so everyone assumes it's simply not their fault), and you have plenty of time to flame people you don't like, and if you lose despite having enough skill to pass, the weakest link in your chain is likely the player who's too new to have enough knowledge. Thus, hostility towards everything and everyone,,1344213284.0,t3_xq3eb

I haven't been able to put my finger on it but I think it's a combination of factors: high framerate, especially in FPS and platformers. For third person games I think animation comes into play - a characters feet pushing on the ground instead of sliding, for example. And consistency in art style helps... plus things like FOV, maybe? 

Maybe it's better to try to list games that people consider ""feel"" right. Quake 3 comes to mind, though I got over it. Dead Space felt great (once I turned off vsync).

1316385111.0,kjvg3,When are games going to mature?,redditor741,146,56,153,"My question is when are games going to get more mature and subtle



The first Matrix is a great example. An oridinary man minding his own business is taken by extraordinary events which pushes him to his limits and even beyond. Pretty much everyone likes the movie. As a viewer it is easy to connect with Neo as he is vulnerable. But do to the extreme events he is capable in great achievements.


Now the second Matrix is the complete opposite. Neo is inhumanly strong and there is no room for character build or any emotions. Nothing that Neo does in the second movie


I watch E3 press conferences and every third word is EPIC. Epic this epic that, every character are in ridiculous poses with no hint of taste. An interview of a game developer is in the tv and he is asked if all the games are already invented. He says ""Yes, it is now just about perfecting these game."" Even some one in GT.com/Invisible Walls asked when COD3 got some bad comments ""Well what could they do better in COD3 as everything is already as big as it can be?"" Also i love Mass Effect but why does commander Shepard have to be an ultimate space marine? I would be more interested how he got to the point where he is in the begining than the rest of the game.


I feel like games are like movies at the time when everything was overacted. Or like the loudness war with music. There is no dynamic range in gaming experiences. The only games that still kind of work are RPGs as they let the gamer somewhat deside the pace.


For a long time the reason for ""bad story telling"" was because there were no good facial animations. Bad animations-&gt; no emotions. Now i hope that through Avatar and LA Noires technology this problem can be beaten. Other reason could be the clumsy way of interacting physically in the gaming world


Quick example: You sit next to a pond in game. For some reason you would like to touch the water and see it ripple. With a controller you can pressa X to interact with water -&gt; lose interest. With mouse you can click LMB and move your mouse -&gt; little better but still lose interest. With Kinect/Wii U controller in other hand you could actually touch the water with your fingers and interact with it. Now this was cool when iPhones came and might sound dull now but this actually opens a whole new door in to games. The choise to grab stuff with your hand of the game floor and interact with it. Throwing/touching/hitting stuff


..But the thing still is that most gamers dont give a lot of concentration for games. As contrast to movies (especially in theaters) people shut down their phones and watch the movie in dark really try to immerse them selves. But for gaming its often lights on with friends at your house


So were do all the subtleties disappear? Will we ever see games like the movies Taxi Driver/Reservoir Dogs. And will/when will gamers start to demand for more dynamic experienses? What does it demand from game developers and players to get more mature games? And if there is a professional game developer ever reading this

EDIT: 

Just trying to clarify something. I dont mean that i want games that are extremely complicated and not mainstream. I also dont mean that games should not have action and explosions like COD. Also when writing this down some great games came to mind like RDR, Alan Wake. But still these games so easily lose the element of suspension by giving too much. 

When i hear about a Star Wars game i imagine how it would feel like living on another planet filled with stuff and sound from SW universe. And then going to adventure where i might see a actual jedi doing what he does best. But no

And all this doesnt just mean fps games. I would love a driving game where i would really feel like driving an Aston Martin on some windy road at a cloudy autumn day. Like really make it look/sound/feel like you where there. No racing

Its like in the morning when your alarm clock and all the sounds sound so fing loud, the games start where the player is already at the end of his development (like Neo in second Matrix). Because everything has to be ""epic"". I bet this is the reason why 90% of gamers dont finish their games as there is no interesting development.

I love it when I find a game that I can drop the setting so low it just looks like absolute shit.. but now I can run it on some 8 year old crap laptop when I travel.. I really love those games.  

I love the games that look totally brilliant at medium settings and run smooth as butter.. and give you more to look forward to when you come back to them 2 years later with a better video card.  

I love the games that look beautiful no matter what the graphics are set to the game If yu have ever played FF11 and dropped EVERYTHING to it's lowest setting you will know what i mean.. DOTA2 uses a very similar effect for lowered graphics.  

Anyways what I wanted to ask.. Are there games that may not have the best graphics

There are games that do this well. **Resident Evil 4**'s Ashley was competent enough to understand that hiding in the trash bin was probably the best way for her to survive a firefight. **Ico** was a hauntingly beautiful story where you had to lead Yorda out of the clutches of the Queen.

There are games that tend to give migraines. **Amy** was simply broken

So you're wondering where I'm going with this. See, it's alright!). The premise was that the main character was visited by a man in the future, who told the protagonist that if he did not marry his childhood friend, then all humanity will be doomed. Basically, there's a gene inside him that will mutate and develop into a deadly disease, but if he marries his childhood friend, then her genes will cancel out his and all will be sunshine and flowers. So the protagonist has to go around, right?

Simply put

It got me to thinking, which made me return the game the next day because it was just so bad). But we haven't actually had a game that put players in a state of vulnerability, causing them to rely on NPC's for protection.

Now, but most of the time AI is just shit waffles in games. Second, people play games to feel powerful, to feel strong, to feel like the hero of the story. But what about horror games? Those definitely put you in a state of vulnerability (well, except **Dead Space**, which I am pretty sure is more action than horror). Recently we had **Spec Ops: The Line** that indicted these power-centric ideas in gaming. And I'm sure we can somehow make the gameplay engaging.

Say, and you hire mercenaries, bought by money from excavations, that you place in strategic locations to defend yourself from bandits, soldiers, and mummies. It's like a combination of a puzzle game and a strategy game!

Have you ever been towards the end of an MMO

World of Warcraft: Burning Crusade

We’ve all felt that sting of defeat, or something that makes the game turn into your personal bitch.  But with all of these choices, and some titles that make it utterly impossible to find the end game gear, doesn’t that leave us with a feeling of incompleteness?

Diablo 3 is the most recent example of the never-ending gear quest, weapons, etc.  You can grind for hours, which people do including myself, and find nothing to progress your character further.  But the moment you do, you link it in your party chat and try to /dance only to find they stopped that ability.  Apparently, there is no dancing in Sanctuary.  But the point here is that people will grind for days to find better and better gear

Borderlands is another example of how the never-ending search for the best gear can turn a casual shooter into a scour for hours.  Spending about a full week’s time with Borderlands, I grinded bosses, DLC, and everything in between because the game’s premise was addicting.  That new shotgun with acid rounds that shot more accurate than a sniper rifle could always be right around the corner.

And in that idea of the best being always rarely attainable

But is this a framing of game style that catches on to the casual player?

I personally think not.  Casual players, and the rewards for the time put in aren’t that appealing to some.  I can say I have never been in a raid, even though I purchased WoW on it’s release and every subsequent expansion.  I never invested the time it would take to become “good enough” to be able to do those things.  I always puttered out of the game until new word came that new things were on the horizon that I could see myself enjoying.  Plus, I was a terrible Undead Warrior.

But could this work for a system that didn’t demand your time and attention similar to a full-time job?

Yes.

Look at games like FarmVille or the newly released Simpsons: Tapped Out.  These are games that require minimal supervision to succeed and it is a constant grind for money and experience for better things that would earn you money and experience.  I personally have played Tapped Out and for the few first days, that time may have only been 15-20 minutes every four to eight hours, but I still feel like that is more of a drain than just taking that time to farm for items in D3.

You can say that the grind in many games is a dull and almost chore-like cycle of brain-melting gameplay.  I would agree, and other MMO-styled games.  The grind isn’t always appealing and if you only have the casual time to spend on gaming and the cash to back up that investment, you can play with the end-game content and go for the prizes that would normally take that long haul to achieve.  With games coming out with the never-ending grind like Guild Wars 2, Torchlight 2, The Elder Scrolls Online, and Balder’s Gate, it doesn’t seem like the zombie hordes of gamers are anywhere close to being done with the hours of grinding ahead of them.

PC Gaming is what many people think of when the Pinnacle of Gaming Trophy is up for grabs.  Where console and handheld fall short is where the PC gaming community takes root.  That small crevice between you enjoying the game and adding your own fun to the game is the PC Modding Community.

This is a highly motivated group of people that change digits, creatures, or even entire campaigns to better accommodate their vision of how the game could or should be.  They don’t care what the intended release for a game was, if they get their hands on something that is fully supported with Mod development.  From Skyrim to the original Quake, modding has been a staple of PC gaming since one of the first real PC titles came into the public eye with Wolfenstein 3d.  People made mods that involved Batman, the Cold War, and even the television personality, the PC gaming market has been a melting pot of ideas

Look at Warcraft III, that mod/title being Defense of the Ancients (or DotA as it is usually called).  This was a game, created by original supporters of Warcraft and spun into a completely different title, complete with separate characters and interest from the gaming community.  This is one of the many different ways that the modding community alters a game outside of it’s original scope of being.

But why does the modding community do this?  Are they not happy with the original product given to them from hours upon hours of work from the developer?

The answer is both yes and no.

Yes, unless they’re more interested in the modding community than the actual game itself (See also: Garry’s Mod).  But with that obvious statement, you get into more complexities of the PC gamer to follow it up with a No as well.  In a world of complete customization for the user of a PC, where you can adjust your Mouse drag by millimeters and make your PC chassis look like it came from a sci-fi aquarium, you want to make sure that if you have the best tool to run a game that the game runs the best it can.  Sifting through the available mods for games like Quake, Skyrim, Fallout 3, more realistic weather and environmental patterns

Some people want to adjust everything in a game so they know they are getting the best part of their money.  Why hate a mod that enhances the facial expressions of NPC’s to make them look more realistic rather than a porcelain doll from 1960?

That is the basic mantra for the modding community.

If there is a rule for a certain game

These groups are quite ambitious as well

The answer is almost a unified yes, and most notably Team Fortress 2.  With this, modders can sell their additional weapons, hats, or other add-ons to users willing to pay for it.  Not everything changes the game, but those that do are taken through the herds of other players and funneled by a voting system to see what people want implemented into their games.  This allows a modding community to thrive and provide better upgrades or additions to content by going through a business cycle, but free modding communities don’t have that.  What is their motivation to do all of this?

For the good of the game and the good of their name.

People want to see their creations supported and played by all gamers

I have a rudimentary understanding of the technical side. I really like Shadow of the Colossus and I've looked up just about as much as I could to write this. Sorta :]

I've seen a lot of comments on GameFAQs and YouTube videos about the physics change in the HD remake of Shadow. As I don't have a PS3 myself and have only played the PS2 version of Shadow

The main complaint is that Wander simply loses grip much more than he used to. I discovered this when looking up tips on how to beat Gaius (#3) in Hard Time Attack. ([Doing the crazy sword-to-head launch became a pretty fun thing to try.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x79Fo97y1yU&amp;t=3m25s)) But, Wander just cannot hold on to Gaius' midsection long enough to make full stabs.

Here is a link to a video showing the original PS2 Gaius run (timestamped to the midsection sigil): http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=epOWzl2KOnQ&amp;t=4m31s

Note that Wander loses grip only a few times.

And here's a video of Gaius on the PS3 remake (again

Constantly losing grip. Butterfingers.

This is usually where the conversation ends. Most people saw this and got really angry at the game. What was once fun to them is now broken. Beating Gaius on HTA became near impossible. Players had to find exploits in Gaius' defensive animations to attack the midsection with little to no interruption: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmQ395LhIvQ&amp;t=1m14s (Making him jostle his sword so he is bent over

But then there's this. A video from 2010 of the PS2 version being emulated on a PC. Smooth framerate and all that jazz. All that's missing is the increased FOV and HD textures: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUdrFkW1RY8&amp;t=4m26s

Losing grip about as much as in the PS3 remake. Hmm.

Shadow of the Colossus was originally made to run at 30 frames per second. On the PS2 version, it's that the skipped frames in the PS2 version were actually making it easier to play. Gaius' midsection would animate in such a way that it would trigger a loss in grip. When the framerate drops, a frame that once triggered a loss in grip is now skipped. In a way, Wander losing grip and ragdolling about like a ninny seems to be the authentic way to experience it.

What it seems like is the PS3 version wasn't fully tested. They focused on just getting the textures cleaner and making sure it played to their liking. Had it gone through more testing cycles

Here's a playlist for the PS2 version being emulated on a PC in HD.

But here is my beef. I just finished FF13-2, and I got mad.

I got mad because it is a way better game. For reasons I didn't think a company like Square Enix could forget. Final Fantasy has always been story driven, of the ~50 hours put into the game, a huge chunk of that is watching movies, which don't need to be there. The novelty of being able to read text was something I never thought I would miss until the industry evolved. Reading character dialogue lets the player create their own voices, even personalities, furthering the RPG experience. In the new games, you are given characters, and they tend to annoy more than entertain. Not to pick on 13 and its sequel

The game, the basic idea being that you were a person playing in a game that was mysteriously putting people into comas. However, the in game universe seemed, to me, appealing. I always wanted to have a discussion on it, but most children, when I had finished playing the first game, even after it was a semi-popular show on adult-swim. 

The basic idea of the game within the game was your normal MMORPG experience. However, weapons, etc. could be purchased. Fake characters could be traded with to get bigger and stronger weapons. These, ofc, would be normal people in game. To fight creatures and explore one had to go to a  Chaos Gate found in each Root Town. Combinations could be put together indicating what you would encounter in your random environment. You would then be ported to an area equipped with both an outdoor and dungeon environment, both equipped with monsters. 
 
Dungeons could be entered and explored. At the ""end"" of each dungeon was a treasure chest with the most valuable of items. Many dungeons were labyrinth-like, would have large bosses in them.

My question is
Would this game style be one that one would be enjoyable?

.hack//fragment was the online version of this game, one would say, should be enough to show that it isn't a good game style as it didn't work out. However, the game style given there wasn't truly perfected, with people having to enter ""lobby's"" to go on adventures and couldn't truly go throughout the world randomly meeting others. I feel as if it could've been perfected. If it was, would you play it?

The publisher with arguably the most restrictive DRM in the industry has seen a massive drop in sales yet still blames it on piracy.

Is there no winning with these people? If a PC game flops commercially it's almost universally attributed to piracy. If said game had little or no DRM, your games have incredibly restrictive DRM yet still flop it's because of piracy. It's much easier to blame a scapegoat like piracy than to admit that your game has faults.

So is there anything else that can be done, ""Vote with your wallet. Don't buy the game, don't pirate it."" Which is good advice, yet seems meaningless.

Before we go

The main problem I have with the game is that it is really dumbed down compared to the original. (I have not played Invisible War at all)

* First of all, everything will go towards hacking. And if you get Level 5 Hacking Skills you can go everywhere.

* Another thing is the whole specialization mindset of the game is gone. Firstly, which you are pretty much bombarded with, and on top of that, you can buy. Secondly, the game tells you do be careful how you spend your Praxis Points, while at the same time throwing them at you constantly, espacially if you are a hacker. If you get maximum hacking you get 75 XP per hacked sofware +additional bonuses + occasional award ""L33t Skillz"" + 200 XP (which is basicly like the ""Scholar"" award, just think to yourself ""Does the objective wants me to go there?"" if the answer is ""No"", because sneaking is way too easy as is, everything becomes so tiny

* Another problem I have with the game is the lack of reaccuring characters. For instance, she reacts in different ways. And the whole game is like that, you do something bad to someone, it will come and bite you in the ass. You do something good for someone? Someone else will be angered and will be angry with you.
Deus Ex: Human Revolution lacked this kind of depth. The story was too linear. Another flaw is that there were too like side quests, it is just thrown out there and nothing made out of it.

* Not so much a flaw but the main actor sounds kinda like Keanu Reeves and everytime I upgraded my suit I heard in my head ""I know kung fu"" ^^

I think this is all I didn't like in the game. Don't get me wrong

That said, but all I can see it for is a gimmick of a mechanic. Take for instance [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P50fvL_EWYY) video, where a lot of the reception is that it's too disorienting, too difficult to manage, and too inferior to just playing Team Fortress 2 with a keyboard and mouse. At the same time though, they seem to be praising it very highly, while not getting any significant gameplay from it! I will concede that this is probably because TF2 itself does not lend itself to highlighting the Oculus Rift as much as , an exploration game or something much more casual. Dear Esther, the kind of people who would enjoy that are probably the same people who enjoy Dear Esther just on their monitor. 

I suppose, but this is only one aspect (and in my opinion, a minor one compared to some of the other things games can do) of the strengths of video games. With ""immersion"" as its only apparent (to me) selling point, it starts to come across less like the next Wii and more like a fancy expensive gimmick that will be purchased by people buying in to the hype, only to sit on dusty shelves after the first couple of hours of trying it.

1361213650.0,18rjwe,What would Mirror's Edge 2 benefit from having?,tigranater,120,32,132,"Although there's been years of back and forth about creating a sequel to 2008's **Mirror's Edge**

I'd like to show you this: http://youtu.be/cKPAt2d5i-g?t=9m4s

It's a playlist about the architecture of **Mirror's Edge**. While the creator does seem to unnecessarily rip on **Mirror's Edge**

* **Level Design:** Although the city is pretty

* **Gameplay:** For a game about free-running

----
----
[**Level Design**](http://header)


**Mirror's Edge** takes place in an unnamed utopian metropolis, most social conflict seems to have been eradicated; and rather the city is an exemplar of successful capitalism and high quality of life, brought to us through a complete sacrifice of liberties and freedom - so it's an interesting twist on usual *cyberpunk*.

Now taken as a whole

There's almost no exposition about the city either (apart from a few cutscenes and a loose story)

**Dishonored** does this perfectly. You only need to look around you and you get an immediate gist of which realm you are in. Abandoned distilleries with Victorian-esque logos painted on the sides to be seen from across Wrenhaven River



Yeah... you get none of that in **Mirror's Edge**. How can we deal with that? There's one simple thing that can do a world of good when it comes to creating fictional cities. *Signage*. Holographic billboards

Compare [this cityscape](http://i.imgur.com/Io1vrxc.jpg) of **Deus Ex: Human Revolution**  with [this one](http://ctrlclick.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/mirrors-edge-007.jpg) of **Mirror's Edge**.

Although by no means is **Mirror's Edge** completely without signage; the billboards are uninteresting and don't stand out

Now only signage won't solve the problem

----
----

[**Gameplay**](http://header)

The video I linked earlier also talks about how the game lacks in freedom. For a game about free-running

**Mirror's Edge 2** can benefit from being open-world. Now many people have said that an open-world ME2 would suffer from a lack of direction. This is a valid concern. Many semi-linear games would be worse off it the world is opened up. Story begins to suffer and unique level design loses its value when it is repeated constantly throughout a large playing are. But **Mirror's Edge** is a platformer where you acrobatically traverse an urban environment to get from point A to point B: in other words *parkour*.

This just begs for an open-world city. And I mean from the ground level all the way to the rooftops. Imagine how much more satisfied you'd be from completing your mission (which often involves getting somewhere dangerous while on hot pursuit by the police) by finding your own way to an objective. The game didn't tell you to climb this building and drop from this height. You decided to skip that altogether and take a much more interesting route: zip-lining from this skyscraper to another and springboarding yourself to the side entrance of your target building. I would gain much more of a sense of accomplishment as it was all my work.

In my opinion

* Where story missions would still involve direction and coherence but let you craft your own solution to the problem.

* And side-missions involve the taking package X to location Y. After all

* And in between we would get to explore a vast city which at the moment is a blank canvas just screaming for an interesting setting to be painted on.

I believe that Perfect Dark illustrates this current lack of game features in the shooter/action genre of gaming. I cant think of one game today that has all the same features that Perfect Dark had 13 years ago. (Halo comes close but not quite)

* A wealth of Weapons (57 total

* capacity to double wield one handed weapons.

* Status Effects that would affect the way your character moved and saw the world (from blinded to sedated to poisoned)

* Tons of Game Modes! (CTF, TD with two or more teams, FFA, Hold the Briefcase)

* BOTS! (the bots had multiple personalities that you could choose from as well as different difficulties

* 4 player split screen (with up to 9 extra bots if you so choose)

* Challenges that could be tackled with friends

* player accounts and customization (you could customize your character, miles run, most effective weapon, least effective weapon, accuracy, and medals earned through out multiplayer)

* A single player campaign that could be played all through out in co-op (even having the other player play as the enemies)

* an interactive hub (the agency) that acted as a menu

While no console game comes close in my opinion to this wealth of features, and The Last of Us. this seems to be almost like a trade off, by simplifying the game features the developers are able to focus resources and player attention to other aspects of the game.

Since I'm always up for a discussion

So

The facts are:

- Vita is not nearly as popular as anyone thought it would be and that goes for both gamers' and developers' interest

- App Store and Google Play are growing like magic beans

- A lot of casual gamers that only play games on their phones and tablets are starting to show more profound interest in gaming

- More and more developers every year are turning to Android/iOS

- smartphones and tablets are rapidly growing in power and a lot of them today are more than capable of running virtually any game made for portable consoles

However:

- most of the said Android/iOS games lack complexity that 3DS and Vita titles have

- portable consoles still perform better because their primary purpose is to run games

- there is still a whole army of loyal fanboys (I'm not saying this in a negative context)

- developing games for portable consoles is a lot easier because you're (usually) optimizing the game for only one device

- a lot of gamers aren't interested in complex gaming experiences on their mobile devices and stick to their consoles/PC's

These of course aren't all of the arguments, but I think there's a possibility that portable consoles won't exist in the future because mobile devices won't only be powerful enough to run virtually any game imaginable, but they'll also open a door to a much wider audience. 

I still don't have the numbers, not every smartphone and tablet user is interesting in gaming, but I think that the divergence between the numbers is big enough to justify the developers' risk to completely abandon handheld consoles and focus on mobile devices.

Any thoughts are greatly appreciated

There certainly doesn't seem to a lack of budget for many of these films, the best game-to-film adaptation (in my opinion) which I've seen is Prince of Persia, which was extremely different to games - it just happened to be a good movie on its own, even though it bore little resemblance to the game series (from what I can tell).

To my eye, it has gotten to the point where I immediately have a lower opinion of those who use the words as reasons to like or dislike a game.

Let us examine motion controls, provided the execution is effective. Metroid Prime 3 and Skyward Sword took motion controls and used them in ways that, at least in my opinion, greatly contributed to immersion in the games' respective worlds and allowed a degree of control that would not have been feasible with standard controllers.

On the other side, while certainly interesting, formed the focal point of the entire game, with shop prices, citizens' responses to your presence, your character's physical appearance, and the ending of the game all changing depending on your alignment. However, perhaps adding a new wrinkle or two (Renegade/Paragon interrupts in the Mass Effect series) to continue to lay claim to the title of ""innovative

My first MMO was SWG. What hooked me was that it did a fantastic job of creating a real living world. It was the little stuff like sitting in chairs and spatial chat. You could drop any item from your inventory and move it around in whatever way you wanted. The players used what was presented to them in creative and unexpected ways and created content for each other that no one could have predicted. So why now are companies so terrified of developing a sandbox as an MMO?",,t5_2sgq6,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/truegaming/comments/ka0li/why_are_sandbox_mmos_dead_xpost/

Why is this?

Platoon, Deer Hunter, Full Metal Jacket etc, are all highly critical of war, for instance and yet are definitely some of the most critically acclaimed war films.

Could an entire MMO work this way? I understand that grinding gives people a sense of achievement when they finally get the piece of gear they've been hunting, for example) or for a badge of honour (like an achievement); neither of which actually affect a character's abilities.

**Imagine an MMO without levels.**

Upon creation of a new character

The character would start with some ugly starter gear that marked them as a noob for all to see. To prove your worth to other players

All areas of a massive world would be accessible by all players. How survivable they are is up to you.  

A brand new character could move directly into end game content and succeed if the player was skilled enough.

**World exploration and ""leveling"".**

Your gear and achievements would stand as testimony to the advanced dungeons your character has traversed. You could choose prospective party members based on their skills. ""Oh, which is pretty tough."" 

""Leveling"" would consist of completing tasks that allow you to join groups for harder tasks. Experienced players would only have to complete a few before beginning ""end game"" content.

**Raids**

You could enter any raid upon character creation, and shouldn't be forced on anyone.

**Immersion** 

When an NPC tells you, you pay attention. Then you go back at level 15 to one-hit that monster. At level cap the monster is a joke.

Imagine an MMO world where the NPCs give you realistic expectations of the monsters lurking around the world. Imagine hearing about a cave nobody survives

**Conclusion**

I realised I've been ranting for a while and have probably repeated myself
