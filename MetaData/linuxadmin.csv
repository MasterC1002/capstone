In working on this project I have done countless searches for basic Linux stuff. Command options, but they don't answer a lot of questions on **why** you should use that command or option. Anyway, that's not important.

I was not met with that attitude here and wanted to express my thanks.

If you'll indulge me

* Install/configure Ubuntu 10.04 Server on a rack-mount HP
* Partition and set up two RAID disks
* Mount those disks on startup
* Remote desktop and SSH into the machine (it's local in my office
* Password-less SSH to our two remote VPS machines
* Wrote three bash scripts - 2 for MySQL dumps &amp; rsync - 1 to backup those backups to a NAS - all with their own log/error files
* Set up those scripts as a cron jobs that run every night and email me a summary

It took me 55 hours to do all that. I realize most of you guys could do all that in well under a day, so I am to you.

Thanks again for the answers and more importantly the welcoming attitude.

* SSH

* Web Server: Apache + PHP

* Database: MySQL


What steps are required to ensure the best possible security? I have the following already done:

--------------------------

**OS**

* Installed the latest OS updates. These will be updated periodically.
* Disabled any services that are not needed

**Services**

* Created a new user with a strong (random gibberish and long), disabled root SSH logins and only permitted this user to login via SSH.
* Only allowed the new user's group to SSH.
* Changed SSH port to a random number
* Disabled SSH port v1 (only v2 enabled)
* Disabled SSH password authentication. Public/Private keys are required.
* Increased the SSH logging levels. I may eventually get things to log externally
* chroot has been set up for Apache and MySQL

**Security**

* Installed and configured Snort ( http://www.snort.org/ )
* Configured iptables to deny everything
* Installed and configured fail2ban ( http://www.fail2ban.org/ )
* Installed and configured knockd ( http://www.zeroflux.org/projects/knock ) for SSH access
* Installed and configured denyhosts ( http://denyhosts.sourceforge.net/ )
* Installed and configured Tripwire ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/tripwire/ )

**Rootkits / Vulnerabilities**

* Installed and configured Nessus ( http://www.tenable.com/products/nessus )
* Installed and configured Rootkit Hunter ( http://www.rootkit.nl/projects/rootkit_hunter.html )
* Installed and configured Linux Malware Detect ( http://www.rfxn.com/projects/linux-malware-detect/ )
* Installed and configured chkrootkit ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chkrootkit )

**Other**

* Backups occur daily (for now)
* A script is setup to check everything to ensure everything remains up.
* An external script is setup to check uptime

--------------------------

I realise a lot of this is redundant (eg. Why have fail2ban when SSH password logins are disabled?)

I know there can never be a 100% secure server, thus security is as high as it can be.

First post in this lovely subreddit. I came across it today and thought I'd pose a question that I've been wondering the answer to for some time. Some background, and how huge (government) enterprise does business. I also had a stint on a ship with ~1500 users and four operational computer networks and various systems, including managing 80+ Windows, RHEL, and Solaris 10 servers. I am certified Security+ and RHCSA. One caveat for those unfamiliar: The US government is slow to change, and open source isn't widely accepted in that realm yet. Furthermore, patching/etc is a very controlled process

Fast forward to today: I left the military


This part is pretty self explanatory.

    Operating Systems:
    Strong experience with Red Hat Linux
    Strong experience with Windows
    Hands on Experience with Solaris
    Hands on Experience with Unix Variants

Working my way down: **PHP engines**. Proficiency in this case as simply I have installed one of these applications before? I understand job postings aren't always written by tech managers but really? Configuration I could understand, mostly homegrown stuff. Good docs are important, but any insight here? **System Monitoring, Instrumentation, Configuration Management** Is this referring to SNMP polling, dashboards for incident management, and updating your documentation? **Flow Control Technologies** SVN is a version control system, PaaS

 
    Middle-tier Technologies:
    Strong experience with PHP Engines – Proficiency in setting up and managing Wordpress/Drupal
    Strong experience with J2EE Containers (Tomcat
    Hands on Experience with Portal &amp; Collaborative Technologies
    Hands on Experience with Content &amp; Document Management Technologies
    Strong experience with System Monitoring
    Hands on Experience with Flow Control Technologies (JIRA
    Hands on Experience with SaaS
    Hands on Experience with Distributed Technologies
 
**Web servers** This one sounds mostly simple to me. Install, monitor a web server, load balancing, etc. **Web Server connectors** The best I get with Google here is a connector is a piece of code that connects a front facing server to it's back end counterparts. What exactly does that mean to a sysadmin? **Caching Solutions** I'm pretty sure this is essentially a proxy server, but as much as I'd like I've never been able to work with open source options in a production environment. **Experience with HTML, JS, CSS** Can anyone explain to me what a sysadmin would use this for? I understand the possibility of many hats in some companies


    Front-End Technologies:
    Strong experience with Web Servers (Apache HTTP Server
    Strong experience with Web Server Connectors for PHP
    Strong experience with Caching Solutions (Squid, CDN etc.)
    Hands on Experience with HTML
 
**Databases** I know what a database is. I know DBAs make more money than I probably ever will. I understand how a SAN works. I could trace the architecture of how a full fiber optic virtualized network gets data from one point to another, destroy partitions, move data around, ensure you don't lose your shit, find your shit when you do lose it, try not to ever type rm -rf * in the root directory. What else is there? I'm not sure if they're just covering their bases or if I'm missing something. **Networking** Basic networking in Linux? Any comments here? **Security and High Availability Concepts** This is one that I feel I've got spot on. **Backup methodologies** tcpdump? What do you guys use? I've never really had to do backups on RHEL, our production servers were attached to SANs which did daily full backups of the entire disks. **Disaster recovery** I know what I would consider this to be...COOP, server images


    Back-End Technologies:
    Hands on Experience with Databases (Oracle, Cassandra etc)
    Strong experience with File Systems (Journaling
    Strong experience with Networking (Interface Bonding, IP addressing, Load Balancing, Proxy, Protocols etc.)
    Strong experience with Security
    Strong experience with Backup methodologies
    Hands on Experience with Disaster Recovery
 
**Scripting** In the environments I've worked in, up to and including having Python installed. I've used a few bash scripts here and there, and I've been working on learning Python for about a year now. I still wouldn't say I'm proficient. How much do you guys code, what do you use it for, how does it help you? What is necessary, and what should I know/pursue? After finding things like [Fabric](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/scenarios/admin/) and other tools listed there, I'm pretty excited about what's possible. Also the realm of remote administration! Using a VPN or a mobile device to access my servers instead of walking my drunk ass to the ship on my day off! Hallelujah! What else? Is this absolutely necessary beyond familiarity with bash? This is the part I'm honestly most concerned about as any other technology I can learn in days


    Scripting Languages:
    Strong experience with Shell
    Hands on Experience with Perl
    Hands on Experience with Python

I've also seen some looking for strong experience with performance tuning. I had to google that, period...I really appreciate any input you guys may have that furthers my understanding of Linux administration, employability, and any of the above technologies or how to further my knowledge of them.

I can't do something interactive like asking for their name because it will mess with the automated jobs.

I almost considered just setting the $HISTFILE to something like HISTFILE=$HISTFILE-$(hostname) and then also setting 'shopt -s append' and then also make it so history appends after each command and not at the end of the session.

- physical disk latency
- LUN latency/throughput (from a block level
- Filesystem statistics
- RDMA stats
- and various other counters

So the problem here

I'm trying to figure out the best approach (technology/product-wise) to use here; OSS only if possible.

My thoughts were to handle as much of the data collection and storage with collectd running on my filesystem servers (over 150). This would handle host side LUNs stats, disk latency/service time/etc. These would more or less be collectd clients, which would send everything to a central collectd server. 

The collectd server would export data to Graphite

From there

My problem is that there doesn't seem to be a good way to leverage a database backend (DB2 is pretty much required in this case) for any of these products.

At the end of the day, hence my preference.

At one time a few years ago

Now, since using collectd to gather/manage a large portion of my data is ideal. It standardizes formats, and is easy to write custom plugins.

Any ideas

Thanks!

EDIT: I did a crappy job of outlining the overall goal. I want to dump performance metrics (a lot of them) to a database, or be massaged enough to fit into something useful for collectd.

A couple of additional questions if I may:

Would it be feasible for me to install a linux server with no GUI for learning purposes in my lab environment to force myself to use the CLI for everything

Would it be practical to just pick up some RHCE materials and start working through it

- We don't have an easy way to install software across all the computers in the lab - there's a solution the current administrators have put together using cronjobs and scripts

- Finally - and there may be no easy solution to this - we have an NFS system set up where everyone's /home directory is stored on the NFS server

I've been getting more and more complaints about spam getting through our email filters

Two years ago we implemented greylisting and it's been a GREAT success. However

Here's my current setup: 
Debian Linux running OldStable (5.0.9)
Exim 4
SpamAssasin (With minimal customization)
ClamAV

All connections are run through an ACL that immediately drops connections based on certain high risk RBLs. 

Then
    They appear in a large list of lower risk RBLs
    Their IP doesn't resolve to a common TLD (com, gov, edu, mil, us)
    Reverse DNS isn't set up properly
    Their IP is not a US IP address

The email is then checked for viruses via Clam

The email is then shipped off to SA to be spam scanned and tagged if it's spammy enough. 

Finally it's considered a ""real"" email and delivery is attempted.

In my scenario

If I clear the cache during the copy process to prevent it from filling up the memory (by repeatedly doing echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/vm/drop_caches) I suffer from **no** performance drop. Hardly a solution to the problem

It appears that this particular problem is known in the mysql community ([here](http://don.blogs.smugmug.com/2008/05/01/mysql-and-the-linux-swap-problem/) or [here](http://jcole.us/blog/archives/2010/09/28/mysql-swap-insanity-and-the-numa-architecture/) ) but I can't help thinking that it is me who is doing something wrong.

I was looking at a [3ware card on ebay](http://www.ebay.com/itm/3WARE-AMCC-9500S-12-12-PORT-SATA-RAID-CONTROLLER-WITH-CABLES-/370625070305?pt=US_Server_Disk_Controllers_RAID_Cards&amp;hash=item564af9c4e1). Can anyone out there weigh in on this choice versus whatever they would do?

So what I don't understand is how from a clean install of syslog-ng my machine logging locally (or /dev/null) can't do more than 9

I don't know much about syslog-ng so it's entirely possible I've just done something wrong but here's my syslog-ng.conf settings:


source s_test {
       udp(ip(127.0.0.1) port(5002));
};

destination d_test {
       file(""/home/test.txt"");
};

log {
   source(s_test);
   destination(d_test);
};


and my loggen command: 

&gt; /usr/bin/loggen -iD -r 20000 192.168.1.34 5002

results:

1358953089.0,174gyz,Advice/Suggestions replacing Windows on user PC's with Linux,lsumnler,18,6,19,"Background

I am a contract programmer/consultant for a small manufacturing company.  I have done work for this company since the early 80's when their entire operation was run on a Wang mini-computer using packaged software written in Cobol; application are AR, Inventory, Order Entry/Invoicing, Bill of Material, and Sales History.  In early 2000 there old Wang hardware was replaced with a Dell Power-edge server running Open SUSE running a virtual machine environment which runs the Wang OS and there applications, and I must say this has worked out well for them.  Over the years their old Wang terminals have been replaced with PCs which run a Wang terminal interface giving each user access to the old Wang applications as well as access to the internet and email capabilities.  As it stands now there are about 14-16 PCs connected to the network via wireless but it is a hodge-pog of Dells, HPs, running everything from XP to MS 7

I would like to bring some order to this environment and I am toying with the idea of replacing all of the various Windows OS with a common distro of Linux (probably Linux Mint 13 Mate or XFCE).

I have installed a test PC with Linux Mint 13 (originally tried Linux Mint 14 Cinnamon but graphics were to glitchy and Firefox kept freezing up).  The Wang terminal interface runs without a problem under Wine.  All of the users are running Libre Office as their office suite so there is no problem there.  There are a couple of external Windows applications which may or may not run under Wine but I figure I can either install a VM running a guest Windows OS or just leave one of the PCs running Windows because these applications are only used once or twice a day for downloading external orders(EDI) and acknowledgement.

I am looking at installing Linux on each machine with my login and password as admin

My Questions:

* Is there a better distro for this purpose?

* Do you have any suggestions or cautions I need to consider?

* Any other specialized software such as monitoring

* Any suggestions with regards to printer setup?

* Generally what have I forgotten or missed?

I understand the fact that the majority of the PC's are connected to the network as wireless is not the best option and it has gotten worse since a switch to AT&amp;T Uverse using a 2wire 3600hgv router has been installed.  From a completely cold start and by that I mean all PC's shut down the IP address assignment on the router being cleared and the modem shut down and restarted.  The users can all get logged in but if a PC is subsequently shut down and restarted it appears to not be able to re-acquire the address.  This problem seems to have been intensified with the addition of a Netgear wireless extender.  It appears that I can over come most of these problems by assigning a specific IP address at each of the PC's but even that has been no guarantee.  If anyone has experience with this particular issue I would love to here your input.",,t5_2r9lc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/174gyz/advicesuggestions_replacing_windows_on_user_pcs/

I've got 2 64GB SSDs and 2 500GB HDDs.  yes, in essence, is much older than md0 (by at least a year or two).  swap space is currently being hosted on a small slice of the SSDs


**This is what I'm wanting:**
I've grown somewhat tired of ubuntu and would like to get back to my roots.  I miss debian.  At the very least, writes software, manages spreadsheets, that kind of thing.  I don't really play games on it and I've got a completely different machine for a media server, so it doesn't need to do any of that type of stuff either.

Ultimately

* has a fast boot time and fast application response (SSDs)

* provides redundancy of both my data and my application installs (mdadm)

* has the ability to easily make backups and restores with minimal work.

* I don't want to have to mess with anything after I get it physically built and installed.

* makes sandwiches.


**This is how I'm thinking about doing it:**

* Like I mentioned above

* I'm thinking of creating 2 raid1 partitions on the SSDs with 1 for debian and 1 for ubuntu

* For the HDDs

* Since debian and ubuntu are so similar

* just as an aside


**This is what I'm wanting from you

* am I just completely bat-shit insane for wanting to do things this way?

* I know that in spite of Ubuntu being somewhat debian based

* I've also found an article suggestions that I move the tempfs to memory via fstab so I'm thinking about doing that

* Lets have a conversation.  I'm not looking for a howto


**more sauce for your chicken:**
I just recenetly ran into issues with an HDD failing which actually caused a whole bunch of other problems (note to all SSD users: UPDATE YOUR FIRMWARE.  YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED).  thankfully I was able to get back ups of everything, etc before everything became a complete shit sandwich.


While I have tried to be as descriptive as possible


Edit:
Adding more info here:

* I do take somewhat regular backups and understand that RAID is not an excuse to NOT do backups.  While they are still manual at the moment

* Thanks to everyone for re-iterating the... ""RAID is not an excuse to NOT do backups"".  Seriously

* I've been messing with Linux for about 10 years now and while I'm certainly no alan cox

* I'm a big boy and am not afraid to break out a man page, it almost feels like I'm on the blunt edge.  graduate school has a tendancy to do that).

About 2 years ago a client of mine was running an old Wang mini computer for their internal business applications but the hardware maintenance cost where becoming astronomical.  I found a company that created a custom VM which allowed the company to continue to run the Wang operating system and COBOL application on Dell Poweredge running OpenSuse (Linux) running the OS in the VM.  In addition, and a few Linux.  IT support goes dumb as soon as I mention my Linux servers.  Also no manual comes with the router but I have finally managed to find a copy on the internet but I am by no means a Network expert.  I know I have to change the ""interfaces"" file to get the server to recognize the Static IP and change or have changed my DNS for the new static IP.  What else do I need to change and what other IP addresses do I need off the router to get my client back up.

Sorry if this is the wrong place to post

Edit:

The static IP's are as follows;

* xxx.xxx.xxx.144 Static IP (non usable) Host
* xxx.xxx.xxx.145 Static IP to a PC running Debian
* xxx.xxx.xxx.146 Static IP to OpenSuse running the VM
* xxx.xxx.xxx.147 Static IP future use
* xxx.xxx.xxx.148 Static IP future use
* xxx.xxx.xxx.149 Static IP to Debian Web &amp; Email Server
* xxx.xxx.xxx.150 Static IP (non usable) Gateway
* xxx.xxx.xxx.151 Static IP (non usable) Broadcast

the netmask for the group is 255.255.255.248 according to AT&amp;T
The router itself has it's own static ip

I know I have to change the /etc/network/interface file on the Debian servers:
auth etho
iface inet static ip
address (would be one of the static IP listed above)
question is should the netmask and the gateway IP's be the netmask and gateway IP of the static group or of the router which has a separate static IP
I have already changed over the DNS server IP address for the web and email server.

I don't really expect anyone to be able to help with the router configuration.  I have talked to tech support on three separate occasions and had them factory reset the router/modem three different ways.  I have eliminated one way it could be setup because it would limit the wireless PC because of limiting dynamic assignment.

And if you check the Cisco provided SNMPv2-SMI it does indeed miss the zeroDotZero definition...

It seems that SNMPv2-SMI is higher prioritized in the translations than the CISCO definitions. What can I do to circumvent this (/increase priority for cisco defs.)?

**Edit**: corrected SNMPv2-MIB to SNMPv2-SMI where appropriate.

**Edit2**: Wanted to inform you that I've now tested with just simply adding the zeroDotZero definition to the CISCO SNMPv2-SMI and it makes no difference. It's still preferring SNMPv2-SMI translation over CISCO's IPSEC-FLOW-MONITOR...

So I ultimately want http requests to **myserver.com** to end up at the web server

So far

1. Move the webserver to *www*.**myserver.com**

2. Leave the webserver at **myserver.com**, I should think.

Any thoughts? Am I going about this entirely wrong? It seems like this is something that should be handled at the TCP layer.

The main goal is to backup a bunch of home devices on a single home server (NAS) while handling the high level of duplicates I've got (pictures

It's somewhat related to a lot of clever solutions. Git-based tools, btrfs, etc. But they don't fit my needs. So here's the poor-man solution I'm thinking about.

It's mainly a union-fs merging an ""in-out"" directory and a read-only-flagged ""store/tree"" directory + a deduping script.

The deduping script combines ""find""

Despite there are files moving from ""in-out"" to ""store/tree""

The deduping script may be run on a hourly basis

But more important: I expect the same script been able to work as well on client side (backuped computers) and server side (NAS).

First, Windows, ...). Then one may run the deduping script on server side  (for example at nigh) to dedup anything which has been put directly onto the NAS through CIFS and FTP.

Second, any open device may perform the union-fs mount and run the backuping script on its side. It requires to mount the ""store"" directory over the network + build up the union mount between ""store"" and a local ""in-out"" path. And here we goes. 

Why running the deduping script on client side? because it will avoid sending twice the same 4GB files every time it is renamed or moved into an other folder. A use-case not handled by installing a deduping filesystem like btrfs on the file server.

A last note: Ive heard about issues when hitting directly directories merged by an union mount. But I've the feeling it will work in my case. edit: First tests confirm it works.

1295453887.0,f567s,Apache Load Balancing - Best Practice Recommendations?,jedireign,11,1,11,"Greetings ninjas

I am about to begin configuring a high-availability web cluster and in the past have used the solution found at the site below:

[How To Set Up A Loadbalanced High-Availability Apache Cluster](http://www.howtoforge.com/high_availability_loadbalanced_apache_cluster)

I am curious if there is a better option to use

Does anyone have a different method they use? This option will work for me

The issues I have with the above are during fail-over / server reboot. Fail-overs work _great_ if the primary load balancer fails, the load balancers lose the virtual IP. Also, during reboot, the heartbeat service will hang on either load balancer, causing the virtual IP to be unbound and my cluster lose connectivity. As a high-availability cluster, this really cannot occur.

Any suggestions?

They are much appreciated! Thanks.

[UPDATE]

OK. I have a lot of experience with Linux V-Servers, and applied the V-Server (www.Linux-VServer.org) patch and assigned private IPs to each one, with the host having a public IP. We then set iptables to pass traffic through to the appropriate V-Server, and allow them to communicate with the Internet as if they had the public IP. We also used nginx to proxy serve http to the correct V-Servers and port forward where needed.

This seemed to be working well

So, someone has figured this out. Problem is, V-Servers are not as popular as other virtualization solutions. That's too bad - because THEY ROCK.

Looks like this is going to force us to move to a Xen based solution. Oh well.

If you are new to V-Servers, but one is getting hammered, that one gets almost ALL of the resources. Overhead is something like 1% per V-Server. There is no resource sharing/allocation per server.

Viewing them from the host

So, and I was wrong. I am sorry about that. That is the root cause.

Having said all that, I would REALLY appreciate it. Basically, I will then be able to have 10+ V-Servers running inside the cheapest Linode.com node, and upgrade that single node as required so they all benefit. Sweet.",,False,,True,t3_t64q7

1332297391.0,r653j,Looking for ideas to automate Linux configuration audits.,vindvio,17,9,33,"Hi Linuxadmins

In my company I am responsible for doing configuration audits to make sure newly installed Linux servers are built following our documented standards. Because our build team does not always follow the standard and many of our existing servers are not in compliance I came up with a way to use GNU autoconf to provide me with a pass/fail representation to tell me what configuration does not meet our standards. 

So for example I use the following test to check if the wvdial package is installed:

AC_MSG_CHECKING([if wvdial is installed...])
rpm -qa |grep -q wvdial
if test $? -eq 0
then
        AC_MSG_RESULT([yes])
else
        AC_MSG_RESULT([no])
fi

which produces output such as:

checking if wvdial is installed...... no

As is probably obvious at this point looking at these audit reports every day is pretty boring and I'd like to see if anyone has some ideas about how I could automate the process of reviewing the output.

- Case sensitivity (lots of Mac files are directories that may end up with duplicate files of different case (e.g. test Test)

I'm in the process of migrating several network user home directories to a Linux file server.  They're coming from various Mac OS X servers, I wasn't too granular about permissions, etc.  However, these particular homes do need a certain level of that.

So what I'll have is a bunch of users all part of the same group.  In addition, recursive rights to the users' data (for assistance, troubleshooting, etc).  With ACLs, I can set default permissions, but those don't seem to hold up if the user does a 'chmod 600' on a file, for instance.  My only thoughts there are to run a cron job nightly or so to ""fix"" the permissions.

The users' homes will be chmod 700.  Unfortunately

This same task went much easier with Debian Lenny on another server. So, the Debian install CD I have is a non-free ISO, because of the proprietary network drivers needed for this server. I can't find the same non-free ISO for Lenny.

So

I'm trying to create a new user account for webmin login and create a user certificate so I can turn off password logins (cert login only). 

On both these systems

When I try to create a User Certificate, the webpage acts like it's loading and I get a SSL Certificate error with the latest Firefox and the latest Chrome. 

I see in the miniserv.users file that the user account I created a cert for has some extra fields in it specific to my input from my certificate form. 

The website won't load for me until I edit the webmin config file (ssl=1 to ssl=0)

I feel like the website is reauthorizing me using the newly updated certificate configuration before it lets me download the certificate. I think this is counterproductive since I can't get on the website until I download the certificate and I can't get the certificate till the website authenticates me. 

Where does webmin store user certificates for re-downloading through SSH/SFTP?

I have a RHEL 6.2 cluster using RGMANAGER to handle failover of the SQUID resource.  While performing some backend iscsi LUN work we noticed that rgmanager was not behaving properly. Here are the session notes:

----------------------------------------------------------------
RGMANAGER was running on both nodes and a service group named ""squid"" was running on node 1. We tried to shut down the cluster on node 2, everything was running except for RGMANAGER. I tried to start the RGMANAGER service, but it stated that the service was DEAD and that a lock file existed. I deleted the RGMANAGER lock file from /var/run and restarted the service without any errors only to find out that it had not started. I experienced the same issue on node 1.

Issues:

1) Cannot shut down cluster

2) Cannot failover service group ""squid"" (Most likely because of the issue with RGMANAGER)

3) ""Init 6"" did not work because it could not cleanly shut down services (Reboot was used instead)

4) RGMANAGER did not work following reboot

5) Starting RGMANAGER creates a lock file

Any help is much appreciated.  Thanks guys.

1348866477.0,10mzwd,RHEL 6.2 - ifconfig shows previous and new network configuration at the same time,haywards5000,12,6,12,"How Should I solve this issue without rebooting the machine ?

I am working on RHEL 6.2 and network runs fine with the present configuration. 
While testing some new network files with different ip addresses
after I restart the network and do ""ifconfig"" it shows the new ip address and bond files(it is only for testing
 
BUT when I revert back to the original network configuration
BOTH the ""bond"" network configuration and also the original network configuration
while there is only orignal ""ifcfg-eth0"" file present in the network-scripts - 
which is right but the network does not work and also I have to reboot the machine to make the present ifcfg-eth0 effective :

1348517852.0,10er87,How to monitor disk queues?,nurtanoob,14,7,25,"Is there a command in RHEL 5.8 that will allow me to monitor disk queues?  In AIX I could do this with a switch in the iostat command but I cannot find the equivalent here.

I'd like to make sure I do not need to adjust queue depths for my SAN disks.

On that topic has anyone ever experienced operations like using rm to remove several hundred files taking forever to complete?  I let it run to around 45min before I broke out.  Something seems very weird.  I found some info on a bug report but I'm not sure it applies to us b/c of the version we're on.  If anyone has any input please throw it my way.  I'd especially love to talk to anyone who admins RHEL in an IBM SVC env.

Thanks in advance!

Up until now

So for starters
    
Currently this is how our folder structure is laid out.

***/srv/***

***/srv/http/***

    drwxrwxr-x  4 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Feb  6 20:42 [site ex. example.com]

***/srv/http/example.com***

    drwxrwxr-x  2 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Apr 24 13:38 logs
    
    drwxrwxr-x  2 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Apr 24 13:38 public_html

This structure worked for us

So one idea was to put each site folder in the home folder of each user. So the layout will look something like this:

***/*** (I'm not going to show everything)

    drwxrwx--x   7 root adm   1024 Apr 29 21:51 home

***/home/***

    drwxrwx--x   2 root root   1024 Apr 30 00:54 [user]

***/home/[user]***

    drwxr-xr-x   2 http [site group ex. examplecom] 1024 Feb 6 20:42 [site ex. example.com] 

And the rest will look similar to ""/srv/http/example.com"". The user folder is root:root because they are chrooted. 

This seems to work

Is there a solution to this problem?

As mentioned above

Also, so if client_a had access to ""example.com"", they will have the group ""examplecom"".

If there is any more information needed or if something needs to be clarified

EDIT: If any one is curious

Problem is

    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""value_of_arg1"" ""value_of_arg2""

I've been able to work around it by doing something like this:

    newarg=""$arg1 $arg2""
    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""$newarg""

Why does this happen?  I've tried many combinations of quotes and escaping quotes...this is the only workaround I came up with.  Unfortunately I have another script where this is causing an issue and it is not fixable by this same workaround.  Can this behavior be turned off somehow?

**EDIT**
I guess I didn't explain it well enough... I'm calling a KSH script from another KSH script. I need an argument to have two parameters. I.E.  -c ""Parameter1 Parameter2""...so that when I process the arguments the string ""Parameter1 Parameter2"" is associated with -c

So when I try this line in the first script to call the second script:

    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""$arg1 $arg2""

It puts quotes around arg1 and 2 for some reason I can't figure out...so essentially the string that calls the second script looks like this...I have verified this with -x:

    /path/to/script -a $arga -b $argb -c ""$arg1"" ""$arg2""

This is bad because when I process the arguments only the first arg is associated with -c and arg2 is not.

How does one install older versions of software. Specifically

I'm having some strange troubles with this server which is based on a supermicro motherboard.

The server runs red hat linux.

The server ""hangs"" when I do ""ifconfig eth2 down"" 

This eth2 and eht3 belong to a new pci card added last week.

Eth0 and eth1 are integrated on the motherboard and they work with igb driver. Eth2 and eth3 are the new ones on a pci and depends on e1000e driver.

Eth0 is configured as follows and is working fine.

    DEVICE=eth0
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=10.0.16.49
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0
    NETWORK=10.0.16.0
    HWADDR=00:xx:xx:xx:xx:5c

Eth1 is configured as follows and is working fine.

    DEVICE=eth1
    ONBOOT=yes
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR=192.168.16.46
    NETMASK=255.255.255.0

Eth2 and eth3 have been configured in many ways, and when ifconfig down the computer still hangs. So IMHO the configuration does not matter.

The modprobe.conf file looks as follows:

    alias eth0 igb
    alias eth1 igb
    alias scsi_hostadapter ahci
    install vtune_drv /opt/intel/vtune/mknod_vtune.sh
    remove vtune_drv /opt/intel/vtune/rmnod_vtune.sh
    alias char-major-10-111 mdm

igb and e1000e modules are loaded and I can see them with lsmod. If anyone would like to take a look to the lsmod output can do it here --&gt; http://pastebin.com/jJ7kk8mn

what lspci shows on ehternet is at follows (2 first eth are eth0 and eth1)

    01:00.0 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82576 Gigabit Network Connection (rev 01)
    01:00.1 Ethernet controller: Intel Corporation 82576 Gigabit Network Connection (rev 01)

As an intermediate Linux user and former organizer, this is because there is a steep learning curve, which requires hundreds of hours of education.  Most often I am told that if I don't understand it, I shouldn't be doing it.

There are many reasons why a novice or intermediate user might require access to enterprise level security.  For example, crypto-anarchy, and anonymity.

Here are some questions I have for reddit.

A. Mandatory Access Control

I read this page explaining [hardened Gentoo](http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/hardened/).  I do not understand any of it.  I have so many questions.  Here are a few.

1.  From a security standards standpoint, or Grsecurity?

2.  Are there any other software packages that should be considered that enhance security beyond these kernel patches?

3.  Are there any beginners guides on proper implementation and configuration of these three kernel patches?

B.  Firewalls

I am aware of iptables.  I have a few questions regarding this too.

1.  Is there a front-end to iptables that makes its vast features apparent and easily configurable?

2.  How can you configure iptables to work as a whitelist?

3.  Are there any good beginners guides for configuring iptables?

C. Crypto-anarchy

I am aware of LUKS, &amp; Truecrypt.  Here are my questions regarding crypto-anarchy:

1.  Mathematically speaking

2.  Are there any Linux based chat/voice/video conferencing programs that don't rely on 3rd party servers such as Google or Microsoft

Next question: when I add a HD to a VM I can run the command 'echo ""- - -"" &gt; /sys/class/scsi_host/host2/scan' to have the new device(s) show up in /dev without needing to reboot. 

When I remove a device

Is there a command I can run that will let me do this without needing to reboot?

Thanks! 

--------------------

EDIT: Thanks for the replies everyone

I like the sound of IAmSnort's suggestion so I will give that a go later on today and report back. 

Glad to be of help SomniSmith :) help me help you help me? :D

-------------------

EDIT2: To clarify I was practicing my LVM skills using a VM. My intention was to add a disk to the VM, make a logical volume out of it, mount it and put some data on it, add another disk and extend the logical volume, remove the second disk and shrink the logical volume, remove the logical volume entirely, then delete the paritions on the two disks and remove them from the system (so that they don't show up under /dev/sd*

The part that was confusing me was the removing of the devices from the virtual machine so as they would no longer show up under /dev/sd*. 

To that end I can confirm two things. One, that way you'll at least get rid of any partitions showing up under /dev. Two, even after you have removed the partitions and removed the disks from the VM, you will still see /dev/sdb and/or /dev/sdc present in /dev. I can confirm that to get rid of them without rebooting, follow IAmSnorts advice and blow them away with the command 'echo 1 &gt; /sys/block/sdX/device/delete', that will do the trick.

I ran (h)top and notice that processes named 'mingetty' (6 of them) are using processor up to 100%.

After some Googling I found out that mingetty processes are writing in file 'var/run/utmp' and when that file grows a bit they use a lot of processor time. I deleted file and it solved CPU issue for a while (just like reboot). I searched where mingetty is mentioned and found files '/etc/event.d/tty1-6'. In all of them I commented line: 'start on stopped rc3' and rebooted machine. After that everything seems OK. What bothers me is that I could not find why would I need 'mingetty' and will I miss it or is this OK? Another solutions is to rotate '/var/run/utmp' so it doesn't grow any more.

%memused is (as expected) around 99% so this is basically useless to me...  I'd like to work out what % is actually being used by programs at any given time.  Does anyone know the formula to do this with the above data?  I'm really hungover and my math is bad at the best of times...

Thanks in advance

Edit:  Thanks for all your comments I will try them when I get back to work on Monday.  I think BorkedHelix is right

**Final edit:** This was actually really easy

In excel the solution is =(total memory - (kbcached + kbbuffered)).

1311346297.0,iwugq,Problems authenticating PHP against PAM.,sequentious,6,0,5,"I'm trying to use a [PAM module](http://pecl.php.net/package/PAM) for PHP to allow authenticating users against PAM. I'm having a bit of trouble getting it to work ""properly"". I'm posting this in r/linuxadmin because I think this is now a PAM issue

For starters

    # /etc/pam.d/php
    #
    # note: both an auth and account entry are required
 
    # Account entry verifies user id
    account sufficient      pam_unix.so audit
 
    # auth entry verifies password
    auth    required      pam_unix.so audit nodelay use_first_pass
    #auth     sufficient      pam_permit.so
 
    # session logs entry
    session sufficient      pam_unix.so audit


When I try to authenticate a user

&gt; Error: Authentication information cannot be recovered (in pam_authenticate)

The /var/log/security file indicates the following:

&gt; Jul 22 10:37:01 testsrv httpd: pam_unix(php:auth): auth could not identify password for [seq]

I know that this is the correct service file (opposed to 'httpd') as commenting out the 'auth required pam_unix' line and enabling 'auth sufficient pam_permit.so' allows a successful login with a valid username (but it doesn't verify the password

[The documentation](http://svn.php.net/viewvc/pecl/pam/trunk/README?view=markup) for the module indicates the issue is probably due to /etc/shadow being unreadable. If I chmod /etc/security to 644, I shouldn't need to. pam_unix.so calls /sbin/unix_chkpwd to verify the password, which is setuid root to specifically avoid this issue.

I can't figure out why something like gnome-screensaver, I've tried copying gnome-screensavers's session file for php use).

A basic view of our setup: It's a university web farm

We've had this happen once on both of our file servers now, it just hangs indefinitely. On the file server, I can walk through the files and read them just fine. Restarting NFS does nothing. In an act of desperation, I rebooted the file server, and when it came back up, NFS was fine. Before I believe I was able to restart rpcbind to get it to come back, but sadly I had forgotten that until after I had rebooted.

I crawled through the logs on everything, until I restarted NFS.

I'm actually in the process of implementing a network access control solution at work (45 sites, it's still in discussion) in order to achieve this goal.

I already have a running simulation using virtual machines and some spare hardware: it works like a charm, with logs centralized via syslogs), if it'll be more interesting to deploy packetfence within the proxy solution on a per-site basis (which allow us to do inline enforcement, as some hardware used on site can be a bit old), or to use a centralized solution on main site (and ditch older switches for new ones on sites requiring it: no inline enforcement on routed vlans, sadly). 

Personnally, and also being less dependant to the NAC solution (if it fails on one site, it'll not fail for the entire organization), but it implies a lot more configuration, and thus, time (which however can be done while preparing the squid machines), but do you think a global solution (with two machines

Ideally, I'd also be able to do something like 'server server1.webfarm1.blahblah history' and see all the messages logged by a particular server.  

I started to whip something up with NC, or that could be used for this.  I also thought of using syslog to log the messages to a central syslog server, then scraping the logs for status messages, but that's not ideal for my use.

1342759040.0,wuwf2,Xen - Internet connectivity with aliased interfaces,ret0,9,5,4,"Hello everyone

I'm fairly new to Xen, but now I want to add internet connectivity. I am finding a lot of sample configurations, an many of them mention the use of bridging, but I'm not entirely sure what I setup should be using... But first, a little about my current setup.

My server (Debian squeeze x64)

    name: eth0
    ip: xx.yy.zz.200
    gw: xx.yy.zz.1
    mask: 255.255.255.0

This interface is aliased into 3 other interfaces:

    names: eth0:1
    ip: xx.yy.xx.201
    gw: xx.yy.zz.1
    mask: 255.255.255.0

Given my unique (with respect to the many tutorials I've read) situation

* Should I be using a bridge?
* Should I give the bridge an IP of 192.168.1.???
* Should I give the bridge an IP of xx.yy.zz.??? (.{201-203}
* Can I scrap the bridge,3} directly?

If anyone has any suggestions


**======== UPDATE ========**


I was able to get connectivity working

Here is what Xen appears to do on boot:

* **Renames** my physical ethernet interface `eth0`
* **Creates** a bridge named `eth0`.
* Assigns the ip address (`xx.yy.zz.200`) defined under the `eth0` entry in `/etc/network/interfaces` to the `eth0` bridge.
* Associates the physical `peth0`interface with the `eth0` bridge interface.

Here are the relevant entries in `/etc/xen/xend-config.sxp`

    (network-script network-bridge)
    (vif-script vif-bridge)

Here are the relevant entries in my `/etc/xen/win7-32.cfg`

    vif = ['ip=xx.yy.zz.201

I also had to configure Windows with the same static IP (`xx.yy.zz.201`) that's defined in my `/etc/xen/win7-32.cfg`

I am building a server that could be used to automate deploying CentOS to other machines over the network.

So far I downloaded the whole install tree from rsync://ftp-stud.fht-esslingen.de/centos/6.0/os/x86_64

Then configured NFS for this and made ks.cfg file.

Tested my configuration using the netinstall image and things went okay but still the process isn't automated

But I am kinda stuck regarding PXE as the documentation of RHEL/CentOS are lacking clear details.

So anyone did such thing recently? How can I do that cleanly?

The /etc/exports in the server contains only this line: /shares	*(ro

And ks.cfg: http://pastie.org/2871681

Also bare in mind that DHCP is handled by the ADSL router

In addition I want to make an update mirror so all servers can be updated local from this master server.

The servers basically should act as Xen hosts. Too bad that RHEL/CentOS 6 dropped Xen for KVM. How can I make installing and configuring Xen in these servers automated? Should I write a script that do that and put it in post-install section of ks.cfg?

Thanks :)

Any suggestions? I thought the init process was supposed to notice the networking service fail and not attempt anything else that relies on networking but maybe I'm just imagining my ideal init system.

The first server to be migrated is the server that will be the PDC. The plan is to then have a second server act as the BDC. Does Samba still have a problem with acting as a BDC? In a perfect world

In my company we typically get hp proliant dl 1xx and 3xx servers in the current generation (now g6 to g7). But I notice in my company things done in completely different ways (monolithic / dirs

So starting with a midlevel proliant box and depending upon its purpose the partitioning changes a bit but typically when I partition Debian or CentOS servers it looks like this:

Often RAID 10 array of drives - sometimes RAID 5...

/boot ext2 256M (force primary)

/ ext3 5G (force primary)

swap at least 2G but try to mirror RAM amount

/tmp ext3 .5G to 1G

/usr ext3 (varies from 8-12 G typically

/var ext3 10-12G

/home ext3 depends...

If I can I leave a nice chunk of unused space at the end of the drive so I can go back and make new partitions (/var/cache /usr/local



My boot is ext2 because I see no need for journaling - is that size OK?

swap - do people generally try to match RAM?

generally it is good practice to separate /tmp

Local:

* HP Proliant DL380
* Ubuntu 10.04
* six (6) 72.8Gb SCSI drives
* desktop GUI (sorry)
* remote desktop
* SSH

Local storage configuration:

* two (2) drives at RAID 0
* two (2) drives at RAID 0
* one (1) drive for boot

Remote:

* two (2) [InMotion Hosting](http://thehackernews.com/2011/09/inmotion-hosting-server-and-trinity-fm.html) VPSs
* CentOS
* LAMP
* root access
* SSH

Trigger:

If you follow that InMotion link you see that they were - and by proxy my company - the victim of an attack. All our sites were compromised. We had no backups other than what InMotion provides. Yes

Goal:

I would like to use rsync to back up the /home directory of each VPS to one of the RAID 0 drives so when needed I could send our local files back to the VPS from whence it came.

Problem:

I've already done some ground work. I can reach the VPS from the local machine and perform an rsync

* **Would it be better to initiate the rsync from the local machine (pull) or from the remote VPS (push)?**
* **If pull
* **If push
* **What would be the ideal command to get everything I need recursively through the /home directory and do I need to worry about file owners/permissions when moving the data in the event that it has to be put back?**
* **What is the best way to secure my local machine for ~~ this communication ~~ my in-office remote desktop / SSH?**
* **Is there any directories in the /home directory that I should not rsync?**
* **Where do I put the SSH keys that I've created on the VPS on our local machine so the rsync can go over SSH with no user input?**
* **Is there a better way to do this given our setup?**

Final thoughts:

I know this is long and probably full of information you don't need. This sub helped me out before and was really welcoming and helpful so I'm back. Please know I have done my fair share of googling and trial and error. Being that I'm dealing with a production VPS I can't afford a mistake. Especially after our clients are already a little annoyed about yesterdays downtime.

I couldn't get my hosting provider to give me an official OS upgrade on my VPS so I have dragged my Dapper server kicking and screaming into Hardy by changing the repos and doing dist-upgrade (after standard methods failed).  I am also not a sysadmin

Software versions
OS: Ubuntu Hardy Heron (previously Dapper Drake)
Apache: 2.2.8
SVN Server: 1.5.1
SVN Client: Tortoise SVN 1.6.15

Since this 'upgrade' everything is working fine except for a few quirks which I am just unable to resolve after 2 days and I've pretty much exhausted Google and I am here in desperation.  Before the upgrade I had no issues at all except with an ancient OS I couldn't install any decent software.

As best as I can diagnose it

The second problem, but via DAV it is doing some random things.  I get the same error in the apache error log for all these flaky actions but I will list the symptoms individually in case they offer an insight:

1. The 'create folder' command in Toirtoise repo-browser fails.  However I can checkout and add folders (not files) through normal SVN commands fine.

2. I cannot add any files at all (directories are fine).

EDIT:  This behaviour is the same for repos created before and after the upgrade.

This is the error message:

    (20014)Internal error: Can't open file '/var/www/svn/error/format': No such file or directory

Now

The only information I have found which seems to make sense but doesn't actually provide any traction towards a solution is that apache is throwing some kind of error (whatever it is it doesn't show in logs as a 500 or 403 or whatever) and that Plesk is trying to render a custom errror document (hence the path mangling as it uses Aliases for this).  I have checked and double checked through Plesk that the option to use custom error documents is disabled for the domain and also grepped all conf files for '/error' (it would have to exist as an alias I guess) but that turns up nada.

Thanks for reading.  I hope somebody can shed some light on this.

[UPDATE]
Update deleted because it seems the Plesk restart reverted my sources.list back to dapper and I ended up installing the dapper version of libapache-svn.  After switching back the sources.list the garbled issue is gone and I'm back to the original problem.",,t5_2r9lc,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/fdfym/dav_svn_apache_2_days_in_no_progress_help/

Now

Basically the issue is that randomly, etc. I can be on VNC one moment, ""connection"" refused the next, and then 5 minutes later back connected.

A ping from 172.20.20.5 workstation shows spotty latency during the times where connections are failing. However it will randomly begin to function and have a perfect LAN latency &gt;1ms. During the perfect latency, which I can host somewhere if need be.

I have made a text file dump of various commands showing the device, etc.

Please let me know what else could be needed to help troubleshoot. This is driving me up the wall. I have updated the NIC driver bnx2 to the most recent update from the Broadcom site. I have disabled iptables and selinux completely. I have allowed the eth ports as trusted. I have turned off Network Manager. I messed with IP forwarding so that my KVM machines could connect but it had no part in whether or not the spikes would happen.

My last thoughts are that it may be a hardware issue. There is another onboard NIC i could attempt to test with and will likely do that when I am off of work...Until then can anyone offer any advise or point me in the right direction?

ANY help is greatly appreciated. I've been bashing my head at this for a while now and just want to be able to roll out my RHCSA labs!

OH MY GOD I MIGHT BE RETARDED. Stand by.

EDIT2: 

YUP! Think I found the issue and I am -in fact- retarded.

Looks like when I set the 172.20.20.2 address on the server, and was ARPing itself to that IP when it was being used by the phone. I noted that when I rebooted the server, I lost connection to the IP for a brief second, then it started going apeshit (wireless phone 2 floors up somewhere) and then after the server came fully online, it would be clean for a while -- presumably once it had kicked off the phone.

_benefits_
1.  Can automate weeky backups/snapshots of the VM (more regular than the current half-yearly that I do)

First of all this problem is on a FreeNAS server, since it's fairly similar I assumed I could ask for help here.

So I have a FreeNAS server with theses technologies used :

CIFS
ZFS
FTP

We have one client using FTP on it through the WAN and 64 clients connectings through CIFS.
Both FTP and CIFS share are on the ZFS pool (wich is on a hardware RAID 10).

Our problem is that our clients are randomly disconnected from the FreeNAS for random amounts of time. During the disconnection the client and the server cannot even ping each other.
The 64 internal clients are on one cisco switch connected directly to the FreeNAS. Same network

We tried doing a failover lagg between 2 Ethernet interfaces on 2 different network cards. Same Problem
We tried doing a load balancing lagg. Same Problem.

When I see they are randomly connected I mean that the clients disconnected are random, 45, 50, 60 and sometimes it's another random group of clients.

That's it. We are trying to figure it out but so far we are going through logs and specialized forums.

So I'm trying to configure Squid as a reverse proxy, listening on port 80, with a full set of all content.

What I'd like Squid to do is act as a single front-end for these servers.  A request comes in, it serves it up.  If not, it should forward it on to the second web server.

Following the guide here: http://wiki.squid-cache.org/ConfigExamples/Reverse/MultipleWebservers

    http_port 80 accel defaultsite=localhost
    cache_peer localhost parent 81 0 originserver name=local
    cache_peer example.com parent 80 0 originserver name=remote
    acl request dstdomain localhost
    cache_peer_access local allow request
    cache_peer_access remote allow request

(I have other ACLs unrelated to this config

The problem I run into is that a miss on the localhost web server (an HTTP 404) isn't properly forwarded on to the remote server - squid only ever tries a single parent.  If I remove the localhost peer

What am I missing in my config to make it do that?

1354486708.0,1463gi,DC/LDAP w/ CIFS+AFP,SharkUW,5,5,2,"Anybody know the best was to go about this? The simplest way to go about this seems to be to use an AD dc since Samba doesn't seem to interate with LDAP well at all. I've tried CentOS 389 as the dc and FreeNAS as well as Nas4Free for the actual share. But the overhead with maintaining Samba users is excessive. At least I can't find a way to get it functional without needing to add a bunch of the Samba attributes to each user individually.

The goal is to get the People/Users object to simply have auth rights to the NAS in general with all users getting a generated 'home' share as well as having LDAP groups be used as permissions for group shares. The shares themselves would simply be exposed as 2 directories

Is there something I'm missing that should be done in LDAP to play nicer with Samba or possibly another solution entirely?

The trouble seems to be that I need to support both AFP and CIFS which means I can't use Windows to serve up the shares. The current live implementation is Windows serving iSCSI to some Apple boxes which are handling permissions via an Apple dc. It's very inefficient.

Using AD is not preferred since I have no experience with it and it's a huge hassle with the current infrastructure.

After installing a new machine today, the other hosts seem to be able to ping the new box and get an echo back even when it can ping them (can't ping from all of the hosts because some of them are network devices like printers). One of the hosts that it struggles to ping is the router/gateway. It can ping our main server (also does DHCP and DNS) with no problems. I haven't tested pinging the outside world (WAN) much

The first thing we do when installing a new desktop is applying our standard puppet manifest to it

We've got a bit of an issue that rears its head every once in a while and I can't find anyone else having the same problem. Doesn't seem to happen at any specific frequency. Anyway the issue is basically this;
We have a few OpenSolaris storage servers. One of these servers acts as a single point for some Windows clients to connect via samba with that server mounting NFS shares from a few other boxes. Every once in a while one of the NFS shares hangs. We have to force unmount it and the weird bit is that unless we reboot we have to wait about 90 minutes to 2 hours before we can remount it. If you reboot the boxes you can mount it straight away but that's not a very good solution.

Does anybody have any ideas? We'll be updating them to OpenIndiana at some point but not for a few months so if this is a timeout setting somewhere i'd love to find it. Hope that makes sense and thanks in advance for reading my sprawl.",,t5_2r9lc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/u1ek4/nfs_timeout_issue_on_opensolaris/

I did a cursory search of different subreddits - started with sysadmin - and it seems like there are at least some tech-support-related-specifically-to-linux-network-management questions in this subreddit. If I'm in the wrong place

Here's what I'm trying to do:

I've got a jump point box. It's got 3 physical network interfaces. One NI hits a wider eng. LAN

What I desire is the ability to ssh/telnet into a particular port on the jump point box and have that port route me to the IP address of one of the cards on the smaller LANs; i.e.

telnet &lt;jump_point_box_IP&gt; &lt;unique_port&gt; --&gt; lowest-level interface on the card on the smaller LAN

Essentially

I've tried this with the iptables command. This is what I put together

Entered from ssh command line on jump point box:

    iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -p tcp –i eth0 \--destination-port 8001 -j DNAT --to-destination &lt;small_LAN_card&gt;

    iptables -A FORWARD -p tcp -d &lt;small_LAN_card&gt; -m state --state NEW
