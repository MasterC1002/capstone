**Venue** Estadio Santiago Bernabeu

**Champions league** last 16

**Line Ups**

[Real Madrid: XI](http://i.imgur.com/ocwd92R.png)

**Substitutes:** Adan, Kaka, Essien, Modric, Higuain

[Manchester United](http://i.imgur.com/N91CXAf.png)



**Substitutes:**
Lindegaard, Anderson, Giggs, Cleverley, Hernandez

**GOALS:**

29' Cristiano Ronaldo (Assist: Di Maria)

20' Danny Welbeck (Assist: Rooney)

**Bookings:**

Manchester United: 5' Robin van Persie

**Facts:**

Danny Welbeck scored his first ever away goal in the Champions League. 

Danny Welbeck is the second English player to score against Real Madrid at the Bernabeu in the Champions League.

Rooney has participated in more goals than any other Manchester United player in CL this season with one goal and 3 assists.

Only Didier Drogba has scored more headed goals in the Champions League (8) than Cristiano Ronaldo (7).

**Match Events:**

**Possession:** 55-44, **Attempts blocked:** 7-2, **Attempts off target:** 14-4.

**FULL TIME**

[93'] Good ball from Jones to RVP after the free kick had been cleared and **his volley** is flicked behind by Lopez. Good save.

[90'] **Three added minutes..**

[87'] **YELLOW CARD:** Valencia is booked after catching Ramos with an elbow. That looked ungainly from the winger.

[85'] What **a hit** from Ronaldo. De Gea was rooted to the spot as his free kick from 35 yards dipped on top of the net. Wow.

[84'] *CHANGE** Rooney comes off. Anderson is on.

[84'] Last Real **CHANGE** - Pep on for Alonso.

[81'] What a **chance** for Giggs! An Evra cross breaks for Giggs who HAS to hit it first time but he tries to beat an onrushing defender. 

[79'] Excellent **save** from De Gea as a scramble breaks for Khedira who gets a good connection on a half volley. The keeper is across swiftly to cling on.


[77'] Good improvisation from Higuain who has a **stab at goal** from the edge of the box as he was falling to the floor. De Gea saves.

[75'] a **CHANGE**: Di Maria

[73'] a **CHANGE**: Valencia on for Welbeck.

[72'] Then RVP has another sensational chance as he chests down a ball and has a free **volley on goal** from eight yards

[71'] Off the bar! Rooney streaks away with numbers in support and feeds RVP who **hits the bar** via a great touch from Lopez.


[70'] Poor from Coentrao who tries a **shot** slash cross from a tight angle. Right at De Gea.

[64'] **CHANGE** On for Kagawa is Ryan Giggs.

[61'] A great ball in from Khedira and Coentrao meets it after stealing ahead of Rooney

[60'] **First change** - Higuain replaces Benzema.

[54'] **Controversy**. Evra, big call.


[53'] Another fizzing Di Maria **effort**

[52'] Decent effort from Di Maria

[49'] Jones takes his eye off Ronaldo for a second and he is fed by Khedira. He fashions a **shooting chance** but De Gea is right behind it.

[48'] Ramos with an unconvincing header

[45'] A lovely dink into the box from Coentrao and Ronaldo is about to **glance on goal** from eight yards out but a late nudge from Evans means the ball hits the striker's shoulder and bounces wide.


[43'] Ronaldo cuts in and **smashes** on goal with his left. It rockets over the bar by a whisker. 

[40'] Rafael hacks at Ozil then tugs him down. **YELLOW CARD**. not ideal for United when he's marking Ronaldo. Free kick on the byline for Real.

[38'] Ozil latches onto a long ball from Alonso and De Gea has to be alert to parry his **powerful effort** behind.

[34'] Rooney fires wide after Lopez punches right to Kagawa

[33'] RVP crosses and Welbeck nips in at the near post with a delicate touch and the keeper gets enough on it to send it **narrowly wide** of the far post.

[32'] Van Persie has a *SHOT* on goal.

[**30'**] **GOAL**! Ronaldo with A fantastic header at the back post as he hangs in the air and beats De Gea. No celebration from him either. Respect. Classy goal though. Superb leap and nod.
Real Madrid 1-1 Manchester United

[28'] Ronaldo with a **FREE KICK** for Real. His first effort hits the wall and his second - a fizzing half volley - flashes wide of De Gea's near post.

[25'] RVP handballs deliberately to try and advance a United attack. A free kick is given for a foul but neither referee nor assistant saw his touch.

[23'] Di Maria has a pop and forces De Gea to tip round the post. 


[**20'**] Welbeck **SCORES**! Real Madrid 0-1 Manchester United. 

With their first real effort at goal United go ahead. Wayne Rooney swings a corner in from the left
Mourinho jumped off his bench as the goal went in to remonstrate with Ramos.

[18'] United's defence parts for Ozil as he charges down the middle

[16'] Another dangerous Alonso **FREE KICK**

[12'] Rooney has a sight of goal and takes on the **SHOT** but a deflection takes the pace off and Lopez claims.

[8'] Ronaldo has a go for goal from 35 yards but doesn't catch it cleanly.

[7'] Real win a **FREE KICK** and as Alonso delivers
 on target.

[6'] What a **SAVE**! De Gea gets a flick on a goalbound shot from Coentrao after Ronaldo's cross was diverted into his path. It hits the post and bounces clear. Superb.

[5'] A **YELLOW CARD** for RVP as he sticks a hand in Ramos's face as a long ball approaches. The defender made a meal of it but no need from the striker.

[5'] a strong run from Di Maria but a rather wild **SHOT** that skews wide of the post as De Gea watches on.

He was a professional cricketer and footballer at the same time. He was signed for £50 from Sheffield United where he had won two FA Cup winners medals and won one England cap but the Chelsea directors had as much an eye on his box office appeal as they had his goalkeeping ability.

At six foot four and 22 stone

Despite this Foulke was no freak show. He was an athletic and agile keeper and was one of the first to punch the ball away from danger. On his debut, conceding just 28 goals. In the six games he missed that year, 17 goals were let in.
