Recently, and inside of each of them I see the same rehashed tips that a player could acquire from spending twenty hours with the game. With this post, I aim to do something different. I will try to create a comprehensive list of advanced tips that I have picked up over the 400 hours I’ve had with the game. I played as a knight and a vanguard, so some of these skills won’t be as useful for MAA or archers. If any other veterans wish to chip in (Tobi, Alice, Hexen, Moose etc.) please do. 

One final note before I start: I am a human, or any points you disagree with and we can have a civil discussion rather than a downvote fest. Also please keep your cries of “exploit!” to yourselves. This thread isn’t a place for that, but rather an objective discussion of valid tactics used in the game.

Here are the topics I hope to cover:

1.	Matrixing

2.	Dragging

3.	Forcing a parry

4.	Going around a parry

5.	Spin Attacks

6.	Advanced parrying

7.	Sidestepping

*****

**Matrixing:**

I’d like to start with matrixing, but it is unique, because unlike your other defenses, such as a shield or parry, it leaves you open to attack your now defenseless opponent at no cost to your stamina. Additionally, your opponent is almost always unprepared for a well performed matrix.
So the question remains: How do you matrix? Essentially, look at the sky, and turn 90 degrees to either your left or right (the turn is optional but it increases your chances of success). The end result is that your player model is moved farther out of range because you are leaning back, your height is lowered (you can duck this way), and the opponent’s attack becomes slightly off target. This can be further supplemented by either an overhead or a stab attack, which will move your model even farther away and even closer toward the ground. With heavy two handers, like the maul, or poleaxe your player essentially bends over backwards when overheading!

When should you matrix? Whenever you think you can pull it off successfully; it is a free hit after all.

A few things I’ve realized about matrixing over time are: 

1.	Overheads are really hard to matrix

2.	Stabs are the easiest to matrix

3.	Slashes are somewhere in the middle and better handled by ducks

4.	Daggers are easy to matrix regardless

5.	If you are barely in range

These points are somewhat self-explanatory

1. Overheads hit your feet, your feet remain in the same place.

2. Stabs are the easiest to matrix because they only cover a very small area

3. Slashes you can matrix by either being very close to your opponent

4. Do you hate dagger spammers? Matrixing is for you! Unless the spammer is right next to you he will miss regardless of what strike he uses

5. The last point while obvious is very useful. You simply matrix their attack, moving back into range.

I’m going to give this its own block because I realized I neglected to mention it and it is one of the most important aspects of matrixing: **Attack when you are matrixing.** This statement holds true for the majority of the time. When you matrix, because not only do you manipulate your player model further, letting you avoid attacks more easily, but also you give yourself a chance to trade if you fail to avoid the attack.

One final point I have to make about matrixing is that you can use it offensively. One way is to hide your attacks. This applies mostly to the stab. If you bend backwards, the opponent will barely be able to see the weapon unless if it is huge, allowing you to get off a sneaky attack. Another way is to bait an opponent. You attack from the edge of their range and as they move in thinking they’ve earned an easy hit you matrix their attack and hit them.

This description of matrixing

*****

**Dragging:**

Dragging is the manipulation of the player view so that your attack lands quicker (accelerated attack)

The accelerated attack is the one that a player encounters most often. It is achieved by looking rapidly in the direction in which your attack is going. One famous and hated usage of this mechanic is the lookdown overhead, some disadvantages to this increased speed; you are more likely to miss if the opponent is strafing, and you might hit the opponent’s parry too early if you’re waiting for it to end. Overall, these disadvantages are negligible when considering the bonus speed.

The other lesser used kind of drag, allowing you to hit opponents despite them parrying. In essence, a delayed attack works by extending the period in which the weapon is released so that it outlasts the opponent’s parry.

The delay is the polar opposite of the accelerated attack. Instead of looking down (or left or right) so that you look where your attack is going, however, is that by looking up (overhead) or to the side (slash) for a delay, you take your aim off your opponent. If you want your delay to work properly, you have to readjust you view back in the intended direction at the last second so that it hits the opponent.

Delays, and between the different types of swings. Therefore, you might not even be able to delay with certain weapons or with certain swings. The swing that works 100% of the time for delaying (with the right weapon of course) is the overhead. You can also delay slashes with difficulty, and stab drags I will give their own little description later on.

Here are certain tips I have amassed for delays over time:

1.	Dragging on the second hit in a combo makes your delay last for much longer

2.	I use #1 with the following combo: Lookdown overhead ? delayed overhead ? lookdown overhead. It’s mixed up timings throw off the opponent completely and allow you an easy kill.

3.	It is hard to hit an opponent with a delay on your first attack

4.	Delaying is not only looking up. For my overheads, and then bring it back down and to the left, making an oval rather than a straight line up and down.

Once again I will go through these so that you can understand them better.

1. Your first attack will always be your fastest, fourth, etc.) attack will make it more effective.

2. Best combo in the game.

3. As explained above your first attack is often too fast.

4. This tactic makes your delay last for even longer and allows you to hit even on your first hit. Remember you still need appropriate weapons.

As I said earlier I’m going to quickly address stab drags. These can be achieved in two ways. In the first way you move your attack outwards from the opponent and then back in forming as wide an arc as you can. Imagine a path akin to a curved shot in football/soccer, making the timing unexpected. The second way can only be achieved with weapons that have a long stab release: Greatsword, Zwei, Poleaxe, etc. Because these weapons have a long release, you can move around the stab at its zenith before you pull it back it, unlike SoW or Claymore which would pull back in almost immediately. With these weapons, the first type of stab drag is delays for less time than the second.

One disadvantage to delays is that they give the opponent more time. In that time

*****

**Forcing a parry:**

Forcing a parry is all about triggering the opponent’s twitch reflex, but feints often leave you open to attack, and with their decreased utility post-patch it is now useful to rely on them even less.

So ways to force a parry are just ways to make your opponent panic/uneasy:

1.	Get in the opponent’s face. The farther you are the more comfortable your opponent will feel.

2.	Make sudden movements

3.	Jump

4.	360

5.	Stop a combo mid-way

6.	Kick an opponent and run at them

Most players

This time #5 is the only one that really needs an explanation. Normally in a fight

**General combat**

-When they say look at enemy's weapon tip to block

-The closer the enemy is to you

-When someone's stab is going through your blocks

-When someone's ''2-hand weapon'' overhead is going through your blocks

-When someone's ''1-hand weapon'' overhead is going through your blocks

-When someone's sideswing is going through your blocks

-You can swing around parries/shields by facehugging and swinging around enemy's body. 

-You can sidestep around the enemy and land a swing around them because of lag. 

-Sidestep to your right and stab

-Doing stab - initiate a combo - feint - stab again results in a slightly faster stab than just doing stab - stab. (It was an exploit before

-Trading means exchanging hits. Enemy hits you and you hit him at the same time. 

-You do not want to trade if enemy has a more powerful weapon than you. For example

-You do not want to trade if enemy is a tankier class.

-You do not want to trade if you are 1 hit away from dying.

-When fighting an enemy 1v1, he will get hit and be disabled. 
-What this means is: 
You attacked and enemy blocked. If he attacks but feints the first swing

-You have to block the attack if enemy starts attack animation right after parrying. They cannot feint out of it.

-If there is a slight pause after their parry

-While holding your shield up

-Sometimes you will get into shield stuck state, then while holding RMB, click any attack.

-Looking straight down while doing an overhead results in much faster

-You can stab and drag the stab around enemy's body. This trick works best with Brandistock.

-Make it a habit to always sprint when moving forward to attack. You cannot sprint forward after you start attacking

-If enemy misses an attack on you due to distance

-Touch (facehug) someone who is sprinting around at least once to stop his movement before attacking. Otherwise

-Terrain height difference makes the combat different slightly. If you are on a slightly higher bump and enemy is slightly below you

-When blocking stab

-It's not always your turn to attack after you block an enemy's attack. Don't attack until you are certain you can hit your weapon.

-The longer enemy's weapon is

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Weapon specific**

1-hand weapons - People like to hit around your blocks. Watch out for sidestepping and then... sideswing from your left

2-hand swords - Overhead hits really fast when close. Other swings are easy to block.

2-hand sword with shields - Stab is the most effective. Stab is used often with this setup. Overhead comes from your right unlike when using without a shield. So you have to look more to your right. People tend to not sideswing with this setup

Spear/Fork/Brandistock - Really long range poke. Long stab duration time. Watch out for stabbing away and dragging around. To block this

Bardiche/Billhook/Halberd - Long range

Maul/Grand Mace - Do not trade hits. Overhead is one shot for the 3 weaker classes. Overhead and sideswing release time is much slower than other weapons so do not block too early. Watch out for overhead-stab

Warhammer - Swing path the same as other 1-handers. Don't trade hits. 
People claim it has longer reach than it looks, so enemy can close in while it is near the end of the swing.

Hatchet - Super fast overhead speed. Experienced players usually overhead.

Dane Axe - Super long range even though it is a 1-hand weapon. Also usually overhead. 

Norse sword - Also super fast overhead speed.

Hatchet/Norse Sword's parry-to-overhead is almost instant. It is ridiculously fast so watch out for that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Class specific**

- Archer

-If an archer lands a hit on you

-As an archer

- Man at Arms

-He moves fast and gets in and out of your range quickly if you are also not a MAA. 

-It's better to use faster weapon if you are a knight

-If you have a longer weapon than what MAA has

-As a vanguard

-As a knight, you will be able to hit him without missing. 

- Different types of MAA

One or any combination of the following:

-Slow MAA - Doesn't dash

-Frenzy MAA - Doesn't stop attacking.

-Back/Forward MAA - Dashing back and forward to get out of your range and annoy you.

-Side dash MAA - Norse Sword MAA. Side dashing to get around your blocks. Look almost 90 degrees to your left to block dash-stab. Look the opposite way for overhead.

-Jump MAA - Hatchet/Dane Axe MAA. After landing a hit on you

-Shield MAA - MAA's shield is broad. So stab and sideswing might not work. Overhead is most effective. 

- Vanguard

-Look above for different types of Vanguard weapon tips. 

-Occasionally, run away, queue attack, then come back to hit you. To deal with this:

-Either,
Or sprint forward, facehug him, and stop his movement. THEN now it's your turn to attack.

-Vanguard's long weapons sometimes pushes you back with stabs. Don't attack after blocking


- Knights

-Hard to kill unless you get better at feinting or getting around shields. Most of knight's weapons do tons of damage

-Tower shield - Hard to get stab/sideswing in. overhead is better and easier to land. 

-Smaller shield - Easy to get around with any attacks.

-You have to look more in the direction of the incoming attacks with shields. Otherwise

**When using a shield

-Sideswing-feint-Overhead - Makes you to turn your shield to your left to hit from your right.

-Sideswing-feint-Sideswing - Makes you to turn your shield to your right to hit from your left. (Because you thought they were doing sideswing-feint-overhead)

-Overhead-feint-Overhead - Opposite of the above.

-Jump/Overhead-feint-Stab - Tricks you into raising your shield up to get a stab in.

-Sidestep-to-Stab - On your screen, almost 50-60 degrees to block this.


- Aiming with Throwables

1361530246.0,190kaj,Lets talk about the current balance of the game.,BadLuckBen,63,13,154,"What weapons do you think to be overpowered

My current views as of last patch:
- In terms of gameplay the game has improved in complexity

- The game is weakest in terms of polish and technical aspects. Most annoying is the server browser and the general lagginess in even local servers. For local servers in games like BF3 and CS:GO I get 25-56 ping most days. Meanwhile on Chivalry I'm lucky to get 80-100

- I love playing MAA but there needs to be a better animation for the dodge. In first person using dodge actually gets me killed just as often as it saves me. The jarring motion of it can make your camera freak out. When facing a MAA on higher ping they seem to teleport and even though after a while you learn to predict their movements it can still mess you up something awful. I've seen footage of people not having the jarring but I am capable of running the game on high and it still happens so it's probably an optimization issue.

- Vanguards were the most annoying class for me on launch but that spot is now taken by archers. Either the playerbase is becoming better at countering lmb spam or last patch just made them less obnoxious. Of course

- As for archers, while not easy to everyone, is simple enough that more people have gravitated towards the class. If the arrow drop and bolt drop was make only slightly more challenging (easier than launch, harder than it is now) we may hopefully see less in larger servers. I've had a good suggestion that you should be less accurate while moving and shooting similar to how CS does things. 

- Knights seem to be in a good spot, two equally skilled players with one being knight and one being MAA I think the MAA will win more often than the knight because of the aforementioned teleporting and facehugging + overheads. 

- Several maps (*Citadel is the worst offender) tend to fall apart because of bias one way or another either due to map design or the number of people on the map. This is often because the defenders spawn way to close to what they're supposed to be defending while the attacking has to walk for what can feel like miles. In some cases the attackers can also overwhelm the defenders because there's more objectives to defend than what the attackers need to proceed. Stoneshill has this problem

- Duel mode is a good addition, I don't think it makes sense to allow archers in duels (some servers disable them thankfully but not a ton) seeing as archers don't ""duel."" They sit in the back and shoot at people or throw pointy sticks, and most matches against them involves chasing them around and preforming the serpentine maneuver and if they get a hit they pull out their dagger/shortsword and start spamming stab. While this is counterable I don't think that is what duel mode was intended for. 

- THE BIG ONE: Mouse dragging and exploits. I have no problem with mouse dragging existing

Overall

TL;DR: It's a discussion on game balance

**Feinting**

Probably the most controversial mechanic in the game. A lot of people feel it turns the game into chance instead of tactics. Solution:

* Reduce the parry cooldown to the point where feints can be parried
* Reduce the stamina usage of feinting

This way, a burn for parrying the second time, and another burn for deflecting the attack. Feinting would become a way to wear your opponent down.

**Facehugging**

The ability to facehug doesn't really make sense realistically since fights would turn to grappling very quickly at that range

* Add a shove mechanic with a very low range that pushes enemies back and breaks their combo
* Change mace/spear/axe weapons to have separate hitboxes for their handles and their heads
* Add damage gradients throughout an attack

Most of the time - especially with weapons like the dane axe and the morning star - you have to block by facing the tip of the weapon

Damage gradients would make attacks do different amounts of damage depending on when in the swing it connects, and someone hugging with a zwei or spear would have to keep a decent distance for their attack to deal its full damage.

**Overhead leaning**

Weapons like the bearded axe and the vanguard swords benefit immensely from looking at the ground while doing an overhead. The bearded axe

The timing feels off on pretty much everything, long time after blocking/parrying that you can strike again. Even when you're just dropping your shield to strike it takes a long time, even when the enemy hasn't hit you. 

Also while it doesn't state it in the patch it feels like they made the reach of the broadsword shorter. I miss all the time now whereas before it wasn't unusual for me to have a 90%+ accuracy. This could be coupled to the reset of the FOV setting

While we have been working a lot this week

* The balance and mechanics update on the beta patch is going well. We’ve been getting a lot of good feedback from the community and we want you to know that we DO listen! We have started up a Balance Testing Council

* In regards to the next beta update, so we weren’t able to get a release out today.

* Customization will be coming soon!  It’s looking really good so far! You will be able to customize your background pattern

* After the current beta is all done and released, it will be released in the beta first and foremost. It’s happening guys! :)

See you next week!

Consider upvoting this for the sake of getting it seen! (I'm not getting karma from it!)


* Teamkilling by mistake happens. Learning how to veer your swings AWAY from people can make it happen less and if it DOES happen

* Swings

* Blocking isn't just about getting your guard up. You have to keep the TIP of the foe's weapon in roughly the centre of your screen for it to be blocked. If your enemy is close to you

* If someone IS blocking repeatedly

* Kicking cannot be blocked and being kicked will stagger you. If you think someone's about to put the boot in against you

* If you're a slower class and your enemy is running away

* Kicking someone requires you to enter the console. Votekick &lt;name&gt; followed by Confirm &lt;number&gt;. It always helps to state why BEFORE you initiate the kick in order to get people to vote.

* Swinging a longer weapon

* A shield that you are not using can still offer impressive protection. If you're concerned about being shot in the back

* In team objective, you might have hit 'h' and accidentally hidden it from view!

**2. Port Forwarding**

You will need to port forward ports.

* 27015
* 7777
* 7778  

If you are unable and/or unaware of how to do this

**3. Dedicated Server Tool**

The dedicated server tool provides only the necessary files needed to host a dedicated server.  While it is possible to run a server using the main game files

    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalry_ded_server

**4. Configuring Server Files**

The server config files are located in the ""Config"" directory shown below.
    
    C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalry_ded_server\UDKGame\Config

Now open the ""PCServer-UDKGame.ini"" file in your preferred text editor and scroll to the section titled ""[Engine.AccessControl]"".  If this is not already present, add ""GamePassword=####"".  Your config file should now look something like this.

    [Engine.AccessControl]
    IPPolicies=ACCEPT;*
    bAuthenticateClients=True
    bAuthenticateServer=False
    bAuthenticateListenHost=True
    MaxAuthRetryCount=8
    AuthRetryDelay=8
    AdminPassword=iamunoriginal
    GamePassword=thisismypassword

To set the server name and message of the day

    [Engine.GameReplicationInfo]
    ServerName=5paceManSpiff's Super Happy Fun Time Server
    MessageOfTheDay=Merry HumpDay!

If you would like to change the map rotation, the only line starting with ""Maplist="" would be this.

    Maplist=AOCFFA-Arena3_p

**5. The Batch File**

There should be a .bat file in the dedicated server directory titled ""start.bat"".  If the file isn't present

    CD ""C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\chivalry_ded_server\Binaries\Win32""
    UDK.exe AOCFFA-Arena3_P?steamsockets -seekfreeloadingserver

The second line launches the dedicated server executable

**6. Starting the Server**

Simply double click the ""start.bat"" file to load up the server.  Then either find your server in the server browser in game

*throws confetti*!

Here are the complete patch notes:

**Fixes:**

* -Projectile stickies should work again.
* -Assists now properly awarded to both teams.

* -Projectile speed should no longer be influenced by framerate.

**Alterations:**

* -Special daze length from 1.5 seconds to 2.
* -Ranged weapons no longer flinch on hit (attack is canceled instead)
* -One-handed bastard swords withut a shield now 'officially' supported; 1 will toggle between one-handed and two-handed
* -Vanguard sprint attack can now be rebound to a key other than mouse 1 to allow you to perform normal slash attacks with a sprint attack readied.

* -Attack grunt will play in the last 200 ms of windup - beyond this point attacks may not be feinted.
* -Combos can no longer be feinted.

**Stamina drain changes:**

* -Stamina drain from parrying an attack is now locked between 8 and 25
* -Stamina drain more consistently based on relative weapon weight rather than damage.

The tutorial fails to mention the riposte.  It teaches things like feints and purposely missing your first attack in order to connect with the second

So

A riposte within Chivalry is a quick counter attack off a parry.  It is normally used to catch your opponent off-guard with a quicker strike after parry.

How do I riposte?

Basically

What's the difference between a riposte and any other attack after a parry?

- A lot of newer players will tell you TK is part of the game, this will prevent you front getting kicked from the server in many cases and keep a happy environment.

- If someone is TKing you a lot

- If you're playing maa

- If you are playing an objective match and there are already 5 archers on your team

- If you are arching, there is no point taking hail mary shots from your spawn. 

- Dont troll or complain to much in chat

- Starting with a knight for the extra HP or a class with a shield to avoid parry mistakes can be a good place to begin.

- Join a clan or invite your friends

I believe that 4v4 TO maps should become a game mode so that groups of friends can play against each other. It makes sense seeing as there are 4 classes

Imagine a map where, or queen, or whoever) out of the castle while it is being raided. We're talking about 4v4 here, so 4 Mason would at the same time be trying to stop the Agatha. The first ""phase"" of this map would be getting the king out of the castle -- navigating its labyrinthine corridors while fighting off the Mason. Meanwhile, the castle could be burning to the ground, adding another dangerous element to the situation (this could even somehow be interactive for the Mason, giving them a strategical advantage if done correctly).

Once the Agatha have escaped the castle walls with their king

Once the beacon is lit and the ship docks, any players still alive and not waiting to respawn will be able to board it, including Mason. Dead players, in Phase 3, will spawn on their own ship, so Agatha will spawn on the ship with the king and Mason will spawn on a different ship tailing the Agatha ship. Mason will be able to kick ladders from their ship to the Agatha ship and cross; meanwhile, Archers from both sides will be lighting the opposite ship up with arrows. Agatha are still trying to protect their king. Obviously, or when the Mason kills the king.

I just wrote this idea up from scratch in about 30 minutes

**TL;DR:** 4v4 maps could be a lot of fun and contain shenanigans involving ships and teamwork. It could also push Chiv toward being a truly competitive team game with both strategy and skill required.",,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1h9bnu/this_game_needs_4v4_team_objective_maps_what_do/

They hinted at being able to change the color of your clothing by making is auto choose for you when you enter FFA. I forget what video I watched where he touched on that point.

One thing I would love to see would be sliders for each section of your armor that is static. So if you are on Agatha you will have a section of your armor that is always blue and cannot be changed. 
BUT things like your boots or gloves or maybe just the lower section of your clothing should be able to be changed in color. 

Of course the helmets are the big thing. I have seen the screenshot of the veteran helmets and cant help but think they need about 15 different helms to choose from for each class.  The extra helmets and being able to change small parts of your armors color would allow everyone to look almost unique and really add to the game. 

Also I want to look the same as my gang when we rumble in FFA.

On to the steam part. I think it would be amazing if the community would be able to make skins and mods and such for Chivalry. I would even be open to a style like TF2 where you can buy different helmets and gear to change the look of your guy. I understand lots of people hate that but I dont miss the 6 bucks i spent on a beard and hat for my solider in TF2. Ive never seen anyone who looks the same in game with the same colors. TF2 has made it so you can modify the crap out of your character and its still very easy to tell what team everyone is on.

Sorry

~ First off, as well as customize emblems. You can see nice close up views of your character and spin them around to see how it looks from all angles. You can choose which helm you’d like your character to wear from this screen as well.

~ Secondly, Steam decided to be difficult at that exact moment, so most likely we’ll have to wait until Monday. Sorry! :( So to tide you over until it’s officially updated, here are a few fixes and alterations written up by SlyGoat, of what’s to come. Balance changes shall wait til’ Monday!

**CU1 Patch 2 Beta 4** (Just a preview of what's to come!)

**Fixes:**

* Projectile stickies should work again.
* Assists now properly awarded to both teams.
* Alt slash tracers for fists draw properly.
* Projectile speed should no longer be influenced by framerate.

**Alterations:**

* Special daze length from 1.5 seconds to 2.
* Ranged weapons no longer flinch on hit (attack is canceled instead)
* One-handed bastard swords withut a shield now 'officially' supported; 1 will toggle between one-handed and two-handed
* Vanguard sprint attack can now be rebound to a key other than mouse 1 to allow you to perform normal slash attacks with a sprint attack readied.

**New experimental feint changes:**

* Attack grunt will play in the last 200 ms of windup - beyond this point attacks may not be feinted.
* Combos can no longer be feinted.

**Stamina drain changes:**

* Stamina drain from parrying an attack is now locked between 8 and 25
* Stamina drain more consistently based on relative weapon weight rather than damage.
* Less cases of minimum or maximum stamina drain outside of extreme circumstances like maul vs. dagger.

**Chase boost changes:**

* Chase boost now only activates against an enemies with their backs turned.
* Chase boost activates from further away.

**Low stamina sounds updated:**

* A wheezing sound will loop when you're under 30% stamina.
* Out of stamina grunt plays when you try to perform an action you don't have enough stamina for

*More to come next week!*

**Man At Arms** Firepots take out 1/3rd of our health- that will usually put us at 2-axe range. Overhead attacks to get around the shield with an axe are good

**Vanguards** Your Horizontal attacks against our shields are bad, and stab-riposte.

Hello everyone!

It’s that time again for our Friday update!

~ This week has been the focus on continuing to work on the balance changes for CU1 patch 2. While we hoped to have a new update on the beta for you by today, it will be coming soon.

~ An exciting piece of news is  that this weekend is free to play Chivalry on Steam! From now until Sunday at 4pm EST

In order to play the game for free, you will no longer be able to play, so take advantage of the sale!

I know there has been some issues with people not being able to join the servers. This is something that is occurring on Steam’s end

~ Level Designer Andrew Seyko made some 2D overhead TO maps for us

~ I setup a Google+ community page for Chivalry
https://plus.google.com/communities/109333686453335811238

~ We have a Community Events section up on our forums

Here's how it works. 

**Ultimate goal is overthrowing the King Argon or King Malric at Stoneshill or Citadel**

* We start with a Team Deathmatch at Moor. 
If Agatha wins,  we move to a Team Deathmatch at Argons Wall, where Agatha will attempt to repel the invading Mason forces.

* At either of the second stages, so if Mason is to lose at Moor, but win at Battlegrounds, they will meet Agatha at Argon's Wall, and vice versa. However if the attacker wins, its on to the next Team Objective where Agatha will attempt to eliminate the Mason fleet at Hillside, or Mason will attempt to ruthlessly poison Agatha's drinking water at the Dark Forest

* At the third stage, if Mason has lost both Moor and Battlegrounds, but then wins at Hillside, they will advance to Argon's Wall. If they have already beaten Argon's Wall, they move to Dark Forest and attempt victory there.

* The final stage will be StonesHill for the Agathian defenders, and Mason will attempt to murder, rape, and plunder the small village outside of King Argon's Keep.

* Upon the defeat of either king, if Mason steamrolls agatha and beats them at Argon's Wall, Dark Forest, and Stoneshill before Agatha has had a chance to attack at Battlegrounds or Hillside, they will attack Citadel directly and attempt to assassinate the King.

* If the rebuttal is successful

* Intermissions will be periodical drunken brawls at the Tavern!

**COME AND SUPPORT YOUR KING!**

I have a copy of Trine 2:Complete that I will be giving away (through Steam) to the person with the highest cumulative score from start to finish. If you already have it

I decided to go vanguard with greatsword. I wind up going 5-0 or 6-0 or something, I kill him with my greatsword of justice. 

Again, I murder him with my mighty greatsword of vengance. He decides to place a kick vote on me, calling me a tking tard. I get kicked with around 66% because his Kila buddies voted yes and some random folks on the other team just saw ""24% team damage"" (from attacking baine) and voted yes.

Normally, coming from Kila, I would expect better. Usually, I like Kila members. They are respectful, good players, and I have a number of them friended on steam, too. 

Has anyone else had this kind of experience with Kila?

So

Anyways, and organize it. These mostly go smooth.

The next part varies by clan, and sends back an answer. These happen pretty often in my expecerience. Clans also hold practices on a regular basis, which may be daily or weekly. At least here in ia, it's daily at 8:30. These involve inclan scrims or organized practice for different classes. This can vary a lot between clans. So lets say you find a clan to scrim against, got your own team and they got theirs. One team hosts a passworded server, sends the console command via Steam who than gives it to his teamates. The begin to join, do some FFA untill both teams are prepared. Team size is traditionally 5v5 and 8v8 but these often change in friendly scrims, each team sends one dueler to a team for one round of dueling to determine who picks map, etc.

If LTS the match will start, wins the game. Pretty simple.

If Team Objective that match will begin. This takes place in 2 rounds, than it goes by how much time was remaining (say as king) or as to what progress the team has made (say pushing the cart) Game ends, gg is shared and the teams usually go their seperate ways or just FFA again for a bit

Scrims usually arent hard to get , via steam. And I think thats about it.
If you have any questions

EDIT: This is the NA scene

EDIT2: A league is currently being made (7/28/13) and will be up shortly. This will organize scrims and toruneys,False,,t5_2vb9k,1375055801.0,,,t3_1fp06t

• You can find them buried in - C:\Users\Username\Documents\My Games\Chivalry Medieval Warfare\UDKGame\Config\UDKStats.ini.

• UDKStats contains rows of numbers. The top number is your total score. Kills earn you 200pts

• Each rank takes *approximately* 1.125 times higher score than the last.  
To know when you will achieve next rank
When server goes to next map
Multiply this saved score by 1.125 and you will get an approximate score needed for next level.  
Compare the difference to your current score as you progress to know how far you have left to go.

• Example:  
rank 56 = 22
22,089,637 = rank 57  
Divide the difference by 200 to get an approximate kills remaining to rank up:  
25,301,900 = 2,787,737. This is the score gap 56-57.  So about 14,000 kills.  

• Below your total score are weapon group kill totals. You can add all of these up to get your total actual kills.

 By now I had no health left whatsoever. And just when I thought it was over came all my allies running up the stairs screaming from the top of their lungs.

1367085474.0,1d85ex,Man at Arms/Archer Tips for beginners. Feel free to add.,HeyItsCody,23,5,24,"**MaA/Archer Tips**

- Pick your fights
- When using your secondary
- One of the most effective swing combos
- When fighting against longer length weapons
- When playing MaA, this was a perfect alternative, you can keep your move fingers on the keys and use your thumb to dodge.
- The higher kill unlock weapons aren't always better. Check the stats of the weapons. Personally I look for speed and damage because when playing MaA or Archer you are going to have to get close anyway.
- When using MaA

**Fighting against shields.** *Shields can be rather annoying when fighting a heavier armored opponent. My best tip is to learn to attack around the shield.*

- There is a key you can map, you swing from the left. When using this move quickly to the left and do the alternative slash. Most of the time you can land the hit.
- Another thing most people dont expect
- Another thing to do is use ""kick"" or ""bash"" to knock the enemy back to where he cant block. I usually dont have luck with this but it can be effective.
- When playing as MaA

Here is the way it works.

1. I get you to within 1 swing on life total
2. I ensure that I won't die from one hit from you.
3. I just turtle until you kick
4. You get a free hit
5. I get a free hit immediately after

I'm proud to announce and host the campaign of our beloved game

Here's how it works.

**Ultimate goal is overthrowing the King Argon or King Malric at Stoneshill or Citadel**

* We start with a Team Deathmatch at Moor. If Agatha wins, we move to a Team Deathmatch at Argons Wall, where Agatha will attempt to repel the invading Mason forces.

* At either of the second stages, so if Mason is to lose at Moor, but win at Battlegrounds, they will meet Agatha at Argon's Wall, and vice versa. However if the attacker wins, its on to the next Team Objective where Agatha will attempt to eliminate the Mason fleet at Hillside, or Mason will attempt to ruthlessly poison Agatha's drinking water at the Dark Forest

* At the third stage, if Mason has lost both Moor and Battlegrounds, but then wins at Hillside, they will advance to Argon's Wall. If they have already beaten Argon's Wall, they move to Dark Forest and attempt victory there.

* The final stage will be StonesHill for the Agathian defenders, and Mason will attempt to murder, rape, and plunder the small village outside of King Argon's Keep.

* Upon the defeat of either king, if Mason steamrolls agatha and beats them at Argon's Wall, Dark Forest, and Stoneshill before Agatha has had a chance to attack at Battlegrounds or Hillside, they will attack Citadel directly and attempt to assassinate the King.

* If the rebuttal is successful

* Between matches

We will be hosting it on the ia teamspeak along with the ia server, but feel free to do so if you want.

We hope to see at least 16 people! Max of 24.

* **Official Servers: **

All official servers have been fixed up nicely. Renamed and ordered properly, so it’s pretty even around the block between North America and Europe, with a few Australian and Asian servers mixed in. 

We’ve gotten a lot of questions asking whether or not we have South American servers and unfortunately

* **Community Events: **

We’ve got two Official Community Events happening this month! 

The first happens this weekend and is titled “Line Formations” and is being run by our Events Coordinator and Forum Moderator Chuckingit!. Full info on the event can be found here: http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=91&amp;t=15733 
Sign-ups end today, so check it out!

The second is a Community Fun Night which happens on Saturday August 10th at 4pm EST. Everyone is welcome to attend! It’s just a chance for some of the community to get together and have a good time playing with one another. We will have a couple servers set aside for this, so we can get an approximate head count of who will be attending and how many servers will need. This is the first of many Community Fun Nights we’ll be having, so let’s make this first one a success! Get to know your fellow community members and make some new friends.

And also a reminder

There are lot of good tutorials out there, so you understand how everything works prior to starting and while you are getting setup. Our documentation can be found here:  https://tornbannerjira.atlassian.net/wiki/display/CHIVCOM/Chivalry+SDK

2) **Emblem Contest**: In case you missed it the first time
Full details here:  http://www.chivalrythegame.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=14449

3) We’ve brought back our IRC channel so come chat with us!
Channel: #tornbanner on QuakeNet
http://webchat.quakenet.org/?channels=tornbanner

4) **CU1 Patch 2 Beta 6 RC 1** is now updated on the beta app!

Yes, we should be releasing into the live very soon!

Here are the changes that were done:

* - If you're kicked during shield drop you're no longer special dazed
* - If you're hit in release on the server
* - Shields should have a .3 longer drop time if you raise your shield while in recovery. This is in the same vein as recovery parries not allowing counterattacks.
* - Tapping block with a shield while deflected extends your shield drop by the remaining time in your deflect
* - Projectile stickys should now show up on characters when they’re hit
* - Flinch is now 1.1 for two handed weapons.
* - Kicks now have a 1 second cool down.
* - You can no longer attack during pre-round freeze in duel mode (IE. Archers).
* - Pole Hammer sprint attack fixed (no longer able to move freely in any direction during the attack).
* - Dodging during recovery should only apply to attack recovery
* - The panic parry function should only work in an attack recovery

Plus I swear I can feel my mouse shake when my maul takes someones head off. I just have a few questions though about some combat tactics and the way things work so here goes.


1. 1st or 3rd? Is this just a preference thing or is one better then the other?


2. I am getting better at playing classes. Moving from knight to vanguard and MAA. However even when I play a MAA or Vangaurd I can never catch someone in their swing. Ill give you an example. A vanguard swings at me with the claymore. I block it and slash back with my 1h mace. He also starts to perform a second swing. Somehow my faster weapon will not hit him before his claymore lops my head off. Am I missing something? What is the trick to timing?


3.  I always seem to run out of stamina before ANYONE. I see people wildly slashing and they just keep going. I just sit there


4. Lastly some tactics. How do I defend and win against a Vanguard? They seem to swing fast and I can never get in close. Same goes for MAA. They are just too fast for me and I can never catch them in a swing. Their swings never seem to reset while mine always do.

This is a tutorial on how to edit your control configuration file to execute more complex commands in the game. For this example

The game's configuration files are located in 

`""username""\Documents\My Games\Chivalry Medieval Warfare\UDKGame\Config`

The file we want to edit is called `UDKInput.ini`

`Bindings=(Name=""RightMouseButton"",FriendlyName=""Parry"")`

`Bindings=(Name=""Q"",FriendlyName=""CancelAttack"")`

Copy the bolded command and paste it in front of the command `DoParry`. You now need to separate the commands

`Bindings=(Name=""RightMouseButton"",FriendlyName=""Parry"")`

Save the file and open up Chivalry. You now have the ability to back out of an attack to block much more easily. It's not perfect

This is only a very simple edit but much more complex commands are possible. In Source games like TF2,False,,t5_2vb9k,False,,Mason,t3_11wx2t

**Sword of War:**

* Needs a head hit on the overhead + thrust combo to 2hit a vanguard. Can often take 4 hits to kill a knight now

**Longsword:**

* Same story as Sword of War: Will sometimes take 3 hits to kill van and 4 hits to kill knight.

**Polehammer:**

* 2hits knight with thrust + overhead. Pretty sure head hit required. Always 2hits knight with 2 overheads.

**Maul:**

* Overhead 1hits knights with head hit!

**Claymore:**

* Needs three hits to kill MAA if no thrusts are used
* Takes 4 hits to kill a knight if no head hits(takes two overhead head hits + 1 thrust hit
* Can no longer 1hit archer unless charge attack? Takes 3 hits more sometimes to kill vanguard. So basically

**Messer:**

* Slash can 1-hit MAA if head hit! Yes? Not sure if it still 2hits knights with 2 overheads. I don't think they changed the overhead damage away from swingblunt like they did to the slash.

**Saber:**

* Saber always 2hits archer with 2 overheads.
* Can 2hit MAA with 2 overheads
* Will often kill van in 3 hits.
* Requires 5 hits on knight with no head hits
* Toss in some backstab damage and saber is a good weapon now. With the windup and combo speed buffs plus the range advantage over shorty and stick

**Heavy Javelin:**

* Thrust backstab does 105 pierce. That's enough to 1hit any class except knight with a head hit(probably need to jump to hit head).

**Bearded Axe:**

* Can 1hit archer now with head hit of its super fast overhead. I think.

**Hunting Knife:**

* Is really fun! The increased size means more reach

I was thinking the other day about how crazy it is for 2h weapons to cut through multiple foes.

Right now it just enabled vans and knights to lmb spam and cut through groups

Basically I think it would be good for there to be diminishing returns on attack. Lets say a van slashes at three people ( and hits them all.) First target would receive full dmg

For instance if the diminishing dmg per target past 1 was 10%, 3rd 80, etc. I dunno if anything is already in the game like that, but I think it would be nice.

1366138985.0,1ch8rw,JD's tips for noobs and Pros - don't hate just add to it- bring more players to this amazing game!,jd27198,20,8,23,"-Know your distances. Know the distance of your weapon of choice's attack and just as importantly know your enemies weapon of choice's distance of attack.
To practice just find a post in the game that you can access from all sides and start swinging away. You will notice where you make contact when where you don't. Learn all the weapons at some point or another even if its just so you know how fast all the attacks swing.

-Know your timing. Your footwork is going to get you in and out of trouble a lot more than just swinging your sword and going straight at someone. Learn how to time your attack to hit just after your opponent swings. So put your distance training into practice and learn how to make that contact hit while avoiding a hit on yourself. 

-Learn your opponent. If there is one guy on the server who is kicking your ass - take note of what he is doing. Maybe his class or weapon is something you should try out. Maybe he is just very effective with doing one attack from one angle but no one has figured him out yet... maybe it will be you.

-Throwing weapons vs melee weapons. I use knight and for a while I was using a shield as well. Now I use knight but i strap on the throwing knives. Once you get accurate with the throwing knife it can be very handy. Especially when the opponent is very low health or you yourself are in very low health. Keeping the distance and landing that one quick throw is a great feeling. If you are a guy who uses bows or crossbows then you are probably pretty accurate with your projectiles so just do whatever you are happy with.

-STARTING OFF NEW. I had the pleasure to first introduce my friend to this game after knowing it quite well. I let him start first with 1 on 1s so that he could grasp the timing and the attacks. Then I took him to a small FFA server so he could see what its like to add it all together but have the randomness of FFA. Then I took him to a big objective game where he already had the idea of fighting 1 on 1

-Location of DAMAGE. This is important. If you can aim for the neck on your enemy then please do. This is very obvious but very important.

-Quick swing or improvised swing. I often will use a swing and then physically move my mouse in the direction of the swing to make it slightly faster. So imagine I swing downwards or something lets say. I might crouch at the same time and look down towards the enemies feet to increase the swing time and hit him sooner with a downward chop. Or more commonly I will swing with a regular left click and then move my mouse to the left- making my character do the same and make impact sooner.

-Ducking or crouching. I dont see this as often as I used to but I still do it all the time. If you time it correctly you can duck certain horizontal swings. If you duck and look down you can crouch even lower however you cannot see what is going on. So sometimes if I am in the middle of a battle and multiple people are swinging at me

All in all I just want people to play this game and enjoy it. I am 27 and used to play Rune: Halls of valhalla and LOVED how the multiplayer was. 
It was an honor system kind of like the FFA server duels. Everyone would stand back though and let 2 people go at it and whoever fell was out and whoever stood then fought the next guy

Each time one of them would interrupt one of my duels, and in that time I've racked up about 15 kills, of mostly interrupters that keep coming back (or attacking two at once - quickly dying with a hammer swing to their faces).

Next minute, and the vote passes with ~75%. The fuck is wrong with these people?

1375642880.0,1joyta,Fhloston Paradise - New Chivalry Server,Sir-Girth,15,1,18,"Hello everyone!

Fhloston Paradise is a Seattle, Last Team Standing and Team Deathmatch. Of course, being that it is a fairly new, the server experiences very low traffic. That’s where you come in!

Here are the key differences compared to the official servers:

-  Archers are limited to ~~two (2)~~ three (3) per team. 

- Team damage is at 100%. Watch those swings!

- Maximum of 24 players to cut down on lag and encourage more competitive play.

- The minimum rank to join the server is ~~20~~ 15. I believe this is necessary with the increased team damage.

The server cycles between Team Objective, if I haven’t already.

Let me know if there’s anything that should be changed that the server could benefit from. You can find the server’s IP address below if you have trouble finding it in the server browser.

1. Do the tutorial

2. Max out your field of vision (under video/graphics settings). It may seem strange at first but after a round or 2 you won't be able to go back to anything less.

3. If you're injured, then having to run all the way back to the battle. 

4. After you've mastered the basics, but with just a few hours of practice you'll have it down and be able to effectively engage way more players. I can honestly say a successful strike after a feint is one of the most satisfying feelings in the game, you won't regret your time spent learning it. Far to few players utilize feinting.

I've been playing Chivalry for 2 weeks and i find this game very interesting and challenging but there are lots of things i don't understand. I've been looking for some answers but i didn't find much about.

In one hand

In the other hand

I like playing man at war without a shield and preferably with an axe (I'm prouder when I kill a vanguard !) but I have some strafe trouble

I've experienced some trouble to kill people

I sometimes think people playing with vanguard do weird thing like starting a shot and then move their mouse all around them and kill me even if I'm not in the line of the weapon. Is it just me or does it really happen?

Thanks for helping a noob to be a better warrior :D 

PS1 : Sry
PS 2 : if you are an archer
EDIT : PS3 : if you have any advice feel free to give it :p

EDIT 2 : Noob TIPS resume

**How to stun ?** 

* As a Vanguard you can stun with the Sprint attack 
* As everyone hit your enemy when he is winding up. If you hit him to late he won't we either stun nor interrupt.
* (Block without stamina ) Need confirmation here

**How many hit do i need to kill someone ?**

It depend of a lots of thing : 

* Your weapon
* The attack type
* His armor
* Where do you hit him

**How to parry efficiently ?**

In general

Here's something I've been thinking about Archers

Currently, or some other knifey-knife. Don't get me wrong -- I find meleeing as an archer tremendous fun -- but it kinda feels like we just have two MAA classes, one with a bow instead of a shield.

What if they upped the damage of all arrows, or slower, or both. I think this would make archers spend more time carefully finding postitions to support their team and defend objectives, and less time sprinting into the middle of furballs and slashing knives in everyone's faces. 

As an Archer I want to hit hard from a distance

I think most people have seen blatant movement speed hackers; people who zoom around the map at the speed of light

The people I'm referring to move at a normal speed; their attacks are blockable; they can be stunned, their broadswords the speed of short swords, etc. It's subtle enough that you're always doubting whether it's real or whether you're just imagining it. But the longer you play against them, the more you feel that they DO swing faster, and that their attacks are *much* harder to block than those of other players using an identical weapon.

Now I realize there's lots of reasons certain players might have attacks that are difficult to block. Or why they might seem to swing so fast. Off the top of my head:

1. They make excellent use of combos
2. They drag-swing
3. They use look-down overheads
3. They use the parry-feint technique (which I've never figured out)
4. They time their attacks exceptionally well
6. They're using a particularly fast version of their weapon category
5. They're lagging


But even taking all this into account, and I've seen people get votekicked for it.

This is a pretty frustrating issue because it can be hard to tell if its just you, I can't count the number of times where I have only thrown two combos instead of three even though I've been constantly scrolling the mousewheel the entire time.  Or somehow I'll throw out an extra attack even though I swear I only scrolled the wheel once.  I even had one time where I threw an overhead when I hadn't touched the scroll wheel at all.  This happens sometimes with blocking too.

3.  Mouse sensitivity changing randomly.  Once again

4.  Flinching seems to be improved since the patch but I'm pretty sure that there is still some problems with it.  E.g. I hit someone with a fast one hander and they are able to wind up a two hander attack and hit me  before I can hit them again (the combination of this and combos not queuing up when i want them two leads to much anger).",,t5_2vb9k,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/17vhij/anyone_else_experience_these_problems/

We are a clan by name, all members have equal priviledge. With this comes equal responsbility, trust, and the development of a clan we can all be proud to be a part of. 

We are a clan with new ideas and a lot of energy. More importantly we are clan of people that are quite good at the game Chivalry. That's why you're here, we are a family. And I suggest we treat each other as such. That being said, however, we are a clan that strongly values organization and obedience, and we expect all of our members to listen to their superiors when on the battlefield (only during competitive matches, of course) 

Lastly, as such we can't have ridiculous slander or negative behavior making all of us look bad. 

That aside

More info:
Where: USA
Requirements: 

-must be nice

-must have mic/be willing to talk

-must have mumble (if you don't know what that is

-must be good

-must be willing to scrim

We have a 16 slot server and a 15 slot mumble server until the payment runs out on it, same slots, same features.

1363044201.0,1a42bt,Known trick (exploit for some) hushed by experienced players,,21,11,16,"You can block instantly if you miss a swing by starting a combo

You can click all three buttons yourself or you could edit the config file to do it for you:

documents/chivalry/config -&gt; open UDKGame.ini  -&gt; go very bottom where your keybinds are saved. 

find RightMouseButton  -&gt; it should say GBA_Parry|GBA_Raiseshield|GBA_MeleeFeint| and so on 

Delete meleefeint and the bar separating each command. Add GBA_Feint in front of GBA_Parry and put a bar between the two. 

What this does is if you press RMB

Now the downside to this is you cannot use your RMB for feint. Use a different button for feint (i use Q and E both for diff. walking direction and i use G for Use because you never really use 'Use' anyways)

This trick will save your life on countless occasions. This is especially useful for slower weapons. This is why those more experienced players seem to be able to block all of your swings.

I'm also marking the objective points with stars and ammo crates with gold boxes. Stationary weapons like catapults are boxes colored for the team who should use it.

The numbers next to the flags show spawn/objective order.

Please join me.",Rath1on,13,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/ChivalryGame/comments/1kjczk/as_a_new_player_to_chiv_ive_gotten_to_lvl_30_and/, so I have no experience pre-patch, or maybe aspects people haven't really mentioned before.

*Pre-patch vs post-patch Combat*

When I first started playing, but it's hard to grasp. All I can really say here is that from a new perspective on the game, the post-patch balance and combat system works very well. Combat is very fluid and doesn't feel like I have to ""exploit"" it to better my opponent. Classes have strengths and weaknesses, but good players can hold their own and pick of the slack of their class as well as expanding the on class' strength, allowing them to really stand out in the battle. But, the ""dumbed down"" game's sporting of decent noobs adds a good static level of balance to the matches and players, so you can still get your ass handed to you if you step out of line.

*Customization*

Am I the only one around here who doesn't have a problem telling the difference between Agatha and Mason Order? Seriously, but I did that pre-patch anyway. I think the customization is fantastic and I hope they expand on it.

*Game Modes and Maps*

I want more game modes! Steal some ideas from CoD - I don't care :P. But seriously

*Closing Thoughts*

I'd like to be able to bind some of the commands (like Yes, etc) to the numpad. I don't have a problem with the community, I think it has a healthy balance of nice people and stupid people, which works for this game because you get to chop stupid people's heads off and vote kick is used constantly. I think a lack of stats being kept (like kills/deaths and all that CoD stuff) keeps the game from getting too stressful, but I wouldn't mind if they added stats. Oh, and I would pay a lot of money for killcams. 

Well, but I'll check in the morning and see. Please share you thoughts on what I said and/or add input of your own on how the game could be improved.

1373222641.0,1htbl8,Bearded Axe Balance,Linred,17,10,17,"&gt; Hello Lords and Ladies

During this weekend I decided to get my hands to the dreaded Bearded Axe to fully realize how ridiculous it was.

Boy I was not disapointed. This thing is a chopping machine. 

The axe has good damage

[See for yourself](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tl_QHBf7iqo&amp;feature=youtu.be)


Quite fast aye? As soon as I connect a hit, and launch an overhead immediately after. You have your super attack

This second attack can be blocked but there is a difference between possibility and parrying rate. It is FAST
If you don't you are almost assured to eat the second strike. On top of that it can desync the attack as you saw in the video. (~0.29 sec of the video)

Right now in the game if you feint your attack at the last second, or sometimes ghost.

The weapon becomes of course worse when you feint


We wanted to do this video to raise the awareness about this weapon. You do feel like a chop machine. It does not guarantee victory every time (try to hit a good MAA with it


Something MUST be done to fix this. I confess I do not have a solution
