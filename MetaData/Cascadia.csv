Does anyone remember how the Tea Party started?

I was there, and it was galvanized by opposition to the Federal government bailing out the failing US auto industry via massive transfers of wealth in the form of tax dollars.  The Tea Party was a reaction against this.  It caught on quickly, and the cries for change started to strengthen.  It was also a truly bipartisan group; it didn't matter whether someone had an R or a D after their name; the Tea Party opposed the bailouts and would work against anyone who supported them.

But then the Right saw this thing happening; this new movement that was neither in their pocket nor that of the Left. So people like Glenn Beck and other right-wing conservatives (calling themselves ""libertarian"" without a hint of understanding the meaning of the word) ran to the front of the parade and pretended they'd been leading it all along.

And it worked.

Other conservatives joined the movement and started calling themselves ""Tea Partiers

This was a problem for the primary message of the Tea Party, but who don't oppose immigration, or welfare, or gay marriage, soon decide that the Tea Party isn't the place for them, and they leave.  Meanwhile, your message becomes more attractive to a smaller, so over time

The Tea Party now is just a branch of the Republican Party, diluted, and eventually lost in the morass of partisan politics as usual.

...

Remember Occupy Wall Street?  They, they were co-opted by more standard left-wing issues, like student loan relief, abortion rights, and strengthening unions.  And Occupy went down the exact same road as the Tea Party, but on the other side of the street.  Now it's a small, vocal group of extreme-left activists

At their inception, and both movements withered away and became worthless.

...


So now here we are, than people in New York or St. Louis or Atlanta or Houston or the District of Columbia are.  A lot of people can get behind this message, because every day gives us more and more evidence that this is overwhelmingly true.

But many of us are still trying to drag the idea of Cascadia down that same

And every time we add an item to our wish list, and our legislators.  Every.  Single.  Time.

The **only** way Cascadia will ever be anything more than a tiny Internet debating society is to grab that one pure desire; the thing we can all rally behind.  **We have to make the case for self-determination

The GOP literally held America hostage in 2011 and they're threatening to do it again soon even though it's constitutionally illegal. What a bunch of scuzzy

Romney already cheated the primaries so there will probably be some voter fraud to get him elected too. It's ugly shit like this that makes me think that an Independent Pacific Northwest or West Coast wouldn't that bad. Cascadia used to sound like a joke to me.. But more and more it really sounds like the only way to go.

If the rest of the country wants to justify:

* blind nationalism
* complete abuse of the constitution
* money as free speech
* denial of climate change
* dis-belief in modern science
* destruction of women's right to own their own body
* complete coercion of the state by the fossil fuel industry
* a broken patent system
* an unstable

Let them... Cascadia would be better off on its own.

They can deny climate change and keep rebuilding the eastern seaboard every year due to continuing northerly hurricanes.

They can scrub the toilets of their royal 1% overlords and call it patriotism while us on the west coast build software

Now I **DO NOT ADVOCATE VIOLENCE** to win our freedom; nor do I encourage the push for Independence if the federal government actually becomes progressive enough to fix the corruption problems.... But, defaults and industries fully collapse.... Then yes, strong regional power with ethical laws and transparent decision making... That's what we will need to escape the mess the monarchs of the East coast have made for us.

As of yesterday

Chuck's newest post does a great job of summing up why this isn't good enough. We are putting some pressure on Steamworks but we need to continue. Send them a tweet, and community. 

Who's interested in teaching Eli of Steamworks what the term Cascadia represents?

**Place:** 1717 Pacific Ave

**Background:** On March 11, nine people were arrested on a public sidewalk for wearing backpacks in a ""no-backpack zone."" Since there is no such thing as a “no-backpack zone”—not even in Tacoma, Washington—the arrestees were charged with disobeying an officer in the duty of directing traffic. The city of Tacoma pursued the cases for one-and-a-half years. After the cases were thrown out of municipal court, the city appealed in superior court and lost again. The ACLU chimed in: Hmmmm...this is suspicious and smacks of Civil Liberties violations!

Now six of the former defendants are suing the Tacoma police and the city of Tacoma. The trial begins on January 7. Please come and support the Backpack 6!

**PLAINTIFFS:**
* Charles Bevis
* Phan Nguyen
* Liz Rivera Goldstein
* Thomas McCarthy
* Leah Coakley
* Patrick Edelbacher

**STARRING IN THE CASE OF:**

McCarthy et al. v. Barrett et al.

**REPRESENTED BY:**

Attorneys in conjunction with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU)

**IN THE COURTROOM OF:**

Judge Ronald B. Leighton

**DATE:**

January 7 to January 17 (Mondays–Thursdays only)

9:00 am to approximately 4:30 pm

**LOCATION:**

The Tacoma Courthouse
1717 Pacific Ave
Tacoma
(downtown Tacoma)

For me this is completely unacceptable and is in fact one of the reasons I wish for a free and independent Cascadia.

I know there a lot of people here who probably don't understand how I connect the dots with this one so I will try my best to explain. I served four and a half years in the US Army which included a year long deployment to Afghanistan in Kandahar province. As a result I now have permanent tinitus

I stopped going to my mental health appointments at the VA hospital in Spokane because they were being scheduled a month and a half between each other. I receive some compensation for my tinnitus and I am awaiting word on whether I will also receive disability for PTSD. I do receive post 9-11 GI Bill benefits but it is often slow going. For example I failed Summer quarter because I did not have the money to buy my books even though I attended most days of the whole quarter. I received my check after the quarter had ended.

I am thankful for what has been provided to me for my service to the US however it is still not enough. Especially when measures to provide veterans jobs or basic needs are constantly turned down in congress in the wake of the current political atmosphere. If a country cannot

However interestingly enough this isn't just held to politicians or slow

It is my hope that Cascadia will treat its veterans with the dignity and respect that they deserve irregardless of an individuals personal feelings about the wars they fought. I hope Cascadia will have a robust and responsive system for helping its veterans

Like I mentioned above if we can't help and provide for out veterans the services they need then how can we do the same for the whole of the people? There is a lot of anger amongst the veteran community over things like this and it could turn out to be something like the Bonus Army back in the '30s.",self,t5_2s4dh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Cascadia/comments/10lgyj/a_veterans_reason_for_cascadia/

Are there some like minded people here on reddit who would like to meet up for some coffee meetings in their cities to have discussions on what to do and how to go about doing it? I am willing to work with a Seattle group. Anybody out there want to represent their city?

I think the first item to address would be the formulation of a comprehensive platform with regards to big, further hone and deliberate, then actually publish a trans-cascadian formal platform. 

Edit 1: for anyone wanting to join a Seattle meeting

http://www.doodle.com/wrta2ayqfmtfkvbc

It is very easy to organize a Doodle poll and I highly suggest that anyone outside of the Seattle area interested in getting a meeting started contact your local Cascadians and Redditors to start a meeting. I will try to post the minutes and discussion points from this upcoming Seattle meeting once it has occurred. Cheers to all and good luck!

The core tenets of permaculture are:
Care of the earth: Provision for all life systems to continue and multiply. This is the first principle

Care of the people: Provision for people to access those resources necessary for their existence.

Return of Surplus: Reinvesting surpluses back into the system to provide for the first two ethics. This includes returning waste back into the system to recycle into usefulness.

There are two big qualms I have with this phrase:

1. It's a call to action which assumes that we currently are not free.  I completely understand the criticisms of our political status quo and sympathize with many of them.  But this phrase makes the underlying assumption that we living in Cascadia, there's definitely many things off about our status quo, but we're not living under tyrannical regimes - I think this phrase has that underlying connotation.  I think a ton of people unaware of what Cascadia is and what bioregionalism is about would be very sympathetic to our visions, but probably won't be on board with the extreme notion that we are currently not free.

2. To piggy back off of that, one must be ""against"" America or Canada.  This too is a false connotation which I think is inhibiting our potential to spread our message.

I feel like these two points are processed internally be those who come across the phrase ""Free Cascadia"" and are subsequently rejected

This call to action speaks to our desire for unity, and it avoids any underlying assumptions of being oppressed or needing to be anti-American/anti-Canadian in order to support ideas and visions for Cascadia.

Just my two cents.  I know many of the images and writings I refer to which have ""Free Cascadia"" are done in a more humorous manner meant to peak someone's interest,False,self,t5_2s4dh,False,,flair,t3_1fmbkd

1) Throw up your city (hopefully somewhere around the Pacific Northwest) or see if someone has already added it

2) Upvote and throw a 'I'm in' or 'me too' comment if you're interested. Think about doing this even if you might not want to lead the effort but are willing to help out. Maybe add a suggestion for a good place to meet.

3) Give it a few days or people to add their names to the list

**Ways in which our group can help out:**

1) Help broadcast the first meetings on our email newsletter and in our facebook groups.

2) Help new folks think of good ways to get started

3) Help get a quick website up

4) And of course hook peoples up with stickers

All it takes is a couple people in each city to get this started as a real regional movement.

I hope that our land of Cascadia would do it's best to have as little involuntary hierarchy as possible, with robust local gift economies. I imagine a democracy as direct as having a potluck with everyone in your neighborhood, or inventing a new, efficient method of transportation with the best minds around. Anarchism, baby.

What would our new nation look like? I wonder what might come out of a constitutional convention. A giant 'what if'

Seal and symbolism – we have a flag, birth certificates, license plates ...

Government – what would it look like? Would it be like a Westminster system

Constitution – how would we decide our new constitution? Should we follow Iceland's example?

Foreign policy – what's Cascadia's relations with other major secessionist and bioregionalism movements?

Currency – modern and tech-infused

Capital – Seattle, something else?
 
Subdivisions – would we retain the current borders of US counties/BC districts?

Business – would utilities be nationalized? Cascadia would be home to some major international corporations ...

Environmentalism – open ended here ...

Anyway, but I think that given the region's positions in relative to the rest of the United States, I'd expect the new nation to be somewhat progressive.

I am currently reading Paul Thompson's *The Agrarian Vision* and this part struck me as being remarkably appropriate for explaining this kind of idea. I thought you all may be interested to read it.

""This type of thought places individuals within concentric webs: family, these webs work as interacting hierarchies to establish feedback loops ensuring that individuals internalize the consequences of their ac- tions into habits of personal character. One does not stand back from a potential impact and wonder how to value it; rather, one sees the whole organic situation as creating more specific value commitments, which are understood as virtues that integrate and preserve the whole. Families provide an environment for the growth and development of children, but communities, in turn, provide an environment that can either help or hinder the proper functioning of family life. Communities themselves take on unique characteristics by virtue of the regional environment in which they exist. In an integrated and healthy moral environment, citizenship

The original intent of this little slice of Reddit was to discuss the things that matter to those of us who are lucky enough to consider the Pacific Northwest home. Things like local news stories, technological endeavors, sporting events, non-partisan political discussions, jokes, etc. are all welcome here. What is not welcome here is hatred, bigotry, shilling

The mods work very hard to address the issues that are raised, censor free speech, or push any particular agendas. We just ask that you act civilized when dealing with your fellow Cascadian Redditors. Simply saying ""Fuck you for removing my post"" isn't going to get you very much traction with anyone.

That being said, had links that were invalid, or were attempting to incite violence toward particular groups of people based on sex, creed, color, ethnicity, etc. The users who have been removed have been removed due to either child-like, or for posting the offending materials listed above. These bans, they're designed to be a time-out in order to let cooler heads prevail.

Ultimately, while promoting the good posts. If something egregious slips through the cracks, please either downvote it, report it, or both. 

We're trying to create a welcoming place for our 3, as a subscriber, keep being awesome, and help us discourage those who are only out to troll.

Now would be an excellent time to direct political action where it could best be served: a party dedicated to Cascadia

From there we can set the building blocks for greater independence and eventually the means to totally self-govern if the right opportunity comes.

You submit ideas as to what you want to see in a Cascadian Bill of Rights and I'll make any changes you want to have put in! I've omitted the last two since they reference the constitution.

Some good starting places are:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Bill_of_Rights#Preamble

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss_Federal_Constitution

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canadian_Charter_of_Rights_and_Freedoms

* Your own wacky ideas

Try to keep as many of your ideas centered on personal and property-based freedoms, arms, cruel and unusual punishments, self-indictment, and freedom of speech.

Let's start with the US Bill of Rights as the template. What would you clarify or change? Post and I'll edit it!

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

You could smell the fresh air along with the wood burning from burn piles or fireplaces in the area. A bird would chirp now and again. The mountains were HUGE (Olympic Mountain range) and covered in snow. The trees were greener than I've ever seen. We just both stood there for a minute looking around as the crisp cool air brushed against our faces. Roughly 40 degrees that afternoon. We looked at each other then proceeded inside where we sampled a few of the fine brews the new Brewery had to offer.

Memetic Cascadia: A knowledge sharing course on building a contagious Cascadia

Course description:

We will examine ways to transform the abstract idea of Cascadia

This course is FREE as it is part of Portland Free School.  The goal is to create a bioregional awakening (Cascadia) that becomes widespread and very contagious and then create a ""culture of active social change.""


Time:
Mondays (starting July 11th) 5:00 PM to 8:00 PM


Location:

Okay we have not found a permanent location for the class and I have decided no matter what we will start on July 11th at 5:00 PM.  So that first class will meet at the front door of Millar Library at PSU.  There is a big beautiful tree that PSU had to build around when they redesigned the library years ago.  We will meet there and send ""runners"" to find a study room either in library of Smith Memorial Hall (northwest across from the library).  When we find an empty room that we can use then we will leave a note at the entrance of the library (we will put a Doug flag or something indicating Cascadia on it with directions).  To get to PSU campus if by bus then there is the Max lines that go up Fifth Avenue end at PSU and the Portland street car also crosses the campus.  The following is the address to the Millar Library:

Portland State University Library
1875 SW Park Avenue
Portland

http://library.pdx.edu/

Future location of classes are still to be located.  We need a place that will not be interrupted by restaurant music, chairs and a center table.  Also a projector and screen or infocus machine would be really great.  We are looking into the Red &amp; Black Cafe, PSU student clubs, several downtown churches and so forth.  I would prefer downtown only because it is centrally located for those coming from all directions in Portland and its outskirts, but if a location that has a main bus route of Max line  near by then that would due.

Now it's been at least two years since I've read the book

- Undeveloped protagonists - I don't need to really explain anything here that Amazon reviewers haven't pointed out already

- Unrealistic expectations of the new society - A society free of cars might actually be attainable

- Extremely focused on the Bay Area - Almost the entire novel focuses on a protagonist who for the most part stays within the Bay Area, but preceded to ignore 90% of Ecotopia. Callenbach himself was an academic at Berkeley which has a somewhat deserved reputation for its academic department being very insular.

For all of these reasons, a piece of literature that truly represents the spirit of Cascadia and Cascadians, I would much prefer Ken Kessey's *Sometimes a Great Notion* over Callenbach's *Ecotopia.* Kessey was a home-grown writer who truly encapsulated the northwest - it's truly an epic novel in many ways.

Legislator Jones clicks on each of these prerecorded videos in turn and listens to the arguments given. She makes up her mind on the bill and turns on her camera connected to her computer. She then uploads her own 3-minute video giving her opinion on whether or not to pass the bill. When the time comes

So, and cell/internet coverage. A cheap penthouse in Metro Portland would be the best location, or barring that, at least somewhere with MAX access.  We'd like to find some housemates to participate in the project, so the ideal space could fit maybe 4-8 people.

I'm willing to spend dollars for utilities and rent if necessary; the housemates can pool their bitcoins and sell them at the end of the month for these bills.  Of course

Finding food and clothing will be a second priority. Got a food truck or a shop somewhere? It'll be really easy for you to participate - I've seen some nice web apps

Cascadia is not a brand. It is a bioregion and the name represents the incredible beauty and abundance this land shares with us. If it is only treated as a brand

The name should only be used to represent that which is working to protect, justice, and beauty to her. Through permaculture design principles like biomimicry, we can use our enormous brains to actually help bring more abundance. 

Additionally, allowing them the space they need to rekindle their culture of inhabitation, and hope that they will share with us a knowledge of how to live in right relationship with the land, instead of just on it or off it. This is the process of decolonization for everyone. We are all colonized at this moment and need to recognize it. 

We live in a time where the US and Canadian governments are wholly run by corporations. We're even taught to think like corporations. Cascadia is under constant threat of having her remaining ancient forests clear-cut

If there's any hope here

It's already happening here. That's really why the name Cascadia has become so popular. People feel it in their heart and see it in the changes happening around them. They can't help but use it. 

This isn't Utopia. It's Cascadia and it's happening now. Through permaculture, we're creating the world we want to live in. Visit http://cascadia-pdx.org to learn more.

So that's what this thread is about. What can we do right now to bring people together? What can we lobby our still separate governments for? I have a few ideas:

-More frequent train service to Vancouver? There is a customs roadblock with the federal government that is standing in the way of the region's needs.

-More cultural collaboration? Maybe a Cascadia music series with local artists touring across the region as a group?

-More collaboration in activism and advocacy. Are we talking to each other enough? This movement can bring together different groups doing the same thing on different sides of the border.

-More cross-border soccer tournaments for teams of all levels?

Meet at the clocktower at Riverfront Park initially and we'll find out if we want to move from there (I promise I won't be late this time!)

Its time to get the ball rolling Cascadians! This meeting we'll see about hashing out some admin related things and talk about reaching out to the people and the various organizations we have in Spokane and the Inland NW. Also we should talk about some quick down and dirty actions we can execute on the short term while we are getting the word out to the people.

Feel free to bring your own agenda items you would like to discuss as well. I mostly laid those out in the description since I feel they are important things we need to take care of before we begin to get into the ""meat and potatoes"" of this. Admin stuff mostly means:

-Adopting a mission statement
-Adopting a name for the chapter (""Spocadia"" has already been suggested!)
-Figuring out who wants do what activism-wise as well as chapter responsibilities-wise

Boring stuff I know but I think its important we have at least the basics figured out before we start to engage the people of Spokane! Also I'm thinking about maybe moving the time to 3pm in case we need more time for things.

People think of many of the reservations as slums with little infrastructure or job opportunity's

I say the best thing we could do is involve the tribal leadership with the terms of their inclusion in Cascadia this would at least be an improvement on many of the policies of the US. 
Do we allow the Tribes the option of secession? I think morally we should though I don't think it would be good for the Tribes or Cascadia. Do we support them though special funding or does that just go to support the idea that the tribes are lesser people incapable of helping themselves? I doubt we can avoid involvement to be quite honest. 

I know the reservations are at least in some way supposed to preserve and protect the culture and way of life of the tribes that historically lived throughout the Bioregion. I am not sure though

 The Reservations stagnate without the public funding and private investment that lifts a community up. The casinos help the community members lucky enough to be involved with them

I propose abandoning the current arrangement of reservations and opening them up. Some might say this would be the end of the Tribes, medical facilities, law enforcement buildings, and parks. We buy the land from the tribe for a hefty sum of money (which is evenly distributed among the members living on the resvations), and then set up a community center or something dedicated to the local tribes history and culture, but also establishing some sort of new organization run by the tribe out of this building to keep the maintain the history and culture of the community. 

We then sell this new ripe real estate off for dirt cheap (re:we lose a lot of money)

This plan relies on a great deal of money which I am not sure a brand new community could afford

This was rather long and entirely hypothetical. Just wanted to get a discussion started. I will understand if this is too much for the community to handle considering at once or if it gets skipped over. This idea has just been sitting at the back of my head for so long I needed to share it. Thanks r/cascadia for being the outlet for my ambition!

1338396928.0,ucbmj,Immigration Policy . . . This Hasn't Been Discussed Yet!,western_shipps,15,3,24,"Oregon has a relatively substantial amount of immigration, has an unacceptable policy on immigration that is often borderline inhumane.

What would be a reasonable policy?

I don't think it should be as strict as US's policy. Immigrants *create* jobs. Immigrants provide an abundant amount of labor that we *rely* on. I say, or to ""steal"". They are here to build on the American (Cascadian?) Dream. In addition, new immigrants would be scarce in number anyway. The US would provide a very big buffer zone. Any immigrants who make it to Cascadia would be lucky, and should be welcomed. Is this radical? Yes. But so is seceding from the States!

We should be a safe haven for those who are *forced*, especially in the northern parts of Cascadia, wouldn't hurt! ""But they're illegal!"" Well, it was illegal for Rosa Parks to sit in the front of the bus, but that doesn't make the law right or wrong. I guess I am just advocating for a less strict, more humane policy on immigration. I wouldn't know the logistics--this is mostly a theoretical rant/statement--I just wanted to bring up the topic.

What do you think?
