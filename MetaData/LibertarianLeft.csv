Though I really like the idea of Libertarianism and often like to think of my views as Libertarian leaning

1) I feel that taxation serves an important purpose in society. To call it ""theft"" seems a little ridiculous to me. If anything, is the way to go. This way we could have substantially lower rates and still collect revenue. Everyone gives a fair share, society as a whole is better off. Everyone wins.

2) Protecting the environment is more than a property issue. If my neighbor pollutes the hell out of his property that still affects me, this is a justified circumstance for the state to intervene, since it constitutes one doing harm to another.

3) I think we could reign in the entitlement system a little for economic and work incentive purposes, but in making sure that those who really need it get it, and weeding out the freeloaders. I've known more than a few people who have used their unemployment checks to buy booze, weed, and etc and this just seems like a slap in the face to taxpayers when this money should be going to things like food and shelter.

There were a couple of points being made that I think we should all be more cognizant of making

Blaming countries isn't really the issue and countries themselves aren't necessarily anyone's enemy:

&gt;But these days, multi-jurisdictional, often quite temporary locations of networks of legal and quasi-legal entities and arrangements.” A company may be located in one jurisdiction, but it is owned by a trust located elsewhere, and administered by trustees in a third location. “Ultimately, then, the term 'offshore' refers to a set of capabilities

Who are responsible?

&gt;“From banks to accountancy firms and corporate lawyers

I especially would like to underscore the part about corporations not being moral entities. In fact

Inequality is a political choice:

&gt;Inequality has already been skyrocketing around the world, but a much larger chunk that's hidden away somewhere, what does it mean for us? Don't forget, as the report notes, that “inequality is a political choice”--that we determine what to do as a society based on the amount of inequality we think is tolerable or just. If that number is far greater than we think, how is that skewing our priorities? Many Americans are already misinformed about our level of inequality—but this report confirms that even supposed experts were wildly underestimating the problem.

This is particularly interesting because it shows how skimming of wealth and productivity has left us in a system of inequity that isn't some ""oh those poor people"" bleeding-heart kind of stuff, that's immoral. If they won't loan it back to us, that's even more immoral. Government does share some of the blame for spending beyond it's means, but it's sort of a moot argument when there's a literal drought of capital.

This is really ironic to me

Where is the NRA and the gun lobby in the wake of systematic groping and invasive scanning in our airports? Where are they when illegal highway checkpoints are now performed within our borders? Where are the gun lovers when our government decided to begin wholesale spying on its own people?

I'm an odd bird in that I am a liberal who supports the 2nd amendment. I have no love of guns. But I love freedom. The Constitution gave us the right to bear arms to protect that freedom from tyranny or invasion. Implicit in that right is responsibility.

If gun owners are just going to use their guns to target shoot, and let their kids engage in mass-slayings, but not to defend against tyranny, why should I maintain my support? If the NRA is just going to act as a lobby for another penis-extension industry, alongside Viagra and sportscars, why should they have my sympathy?

The founders didn't really care enough about hunting/target-shooting/killing-burglars enough to grant a Constitutional amendment. There was a higher calling in mind. But when will our 'militias' answer the call?

The NRA can and should immerse itself in every issue infringing on the Bill of Rights, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, 9th &amp; 10th amendments

If I am starting to see that my peers don't actually value freedom

Mind you, but after switching to an-cap, I became more philosophical and jaded. Everything was an abstract and societal injustice didn't seem as real to me because I kind of withdrew from the main of society. I think this had a lot to do with feeling isolated (nobody where I live, including family and former friends) take my views of anarchism seriously. A lot of people here are statist liberals. 

Reading this, but I got into it mainly for work experience (since I'm have extreme difficulty finding employment).

Around 20 people have already joined the project, distributors and donors. The first two pamphlets are done (on liberty and education). The third pamphlet (on corporations) is written but not yet designed.

We are running short on funds and we need more distributors. See here for more information:

http://www.indiegogo.com/commonsense

I expect a lot of great things to come out of this

* people saying ""D'oh! Now I get liberty.""
* more resistance to authoritarianism
* more libertarians getting elected to office
* mainstream media coverage for the people involved
* it could even pave the way for a Ron Paul or Gary Johnson win

Be a part of this pioneering project! Join us as a researcher, donor or just by sharing it with your friends.

Join this revolutionary project as we set the stage for a more libertarian 2012!

I think Teddy Roosevelt said it best: ""We demand that big business give the people a square deal; in return we must insist that when anyone engaged in big business honestly endeavors to do right he shall himself be given a square deal.""

As for the super rich and taxes, and therefore too much power (although I believe money should not give any one person or entity more political power than another) we should have things like luxury, property, estate, and inheritance taxes instead. In that way, we can still tax the general population a bit, but not based on their work, only on things that are excessive

(If I had to pick a stateless variant of left-libertarianism to endorse

My journey to becoming a left-libertarian initially started with my belief that a society has an obligation to inform its members about virtually every economic decision as much as possible. So while right libertarians would rather burn down the house and with it, SEC, FEC, et al. perform valuable functions that help to mitigate the effects of *caveat emptor*.

Over the last several months, not just negative rights. After all, isn't ""freedom to"" just as important as ""freedom from""?
So, single-payer) healthcare system.

As I know there are several possible models for this to be implemented

I have convinced myself that single-payer is the most efficient means of healthcare for all... but what I'm running into is something I have not been able to get around and I have no urge to get around either. And that is the notion that of the implicit social obligation in any form of universal healthcare: **if you benefit from the system

And I still don't agree with that. This basically means that things like sin taxes, cigarettes, and as it's looking like now-- fast food -- are immoral in my view. And it seems this one view is preventing me from continuing further with this entitlement logic.

So I put it to you guys like this:

* Can these views be reconciled together? Does it make a difference if they are or not?

* If not

* If left libertarians do not justify anything of this sort

I want to thank you for any answers you all have.

As of late, since I always followed the media's presentation of the definition of Socialism as a nanny-state that sees free markets as evil and immoral, and a bunch of other bullshit that I couldn't agree with. After reading the posts on /r/Anarchy about how Anarcho-Capitalism is a contradiction in terms, about how Capitalism required some sort of state or coercive force, and reading numerous posts demanding that /r/Anarcho-Capitalism be taken off of the /r/Politics side bar because it was a just ""Edgy Libertarian Teenagers who have never touched a reputable Political text who just want to rebrand themselves ""Anarchists"" somehow for le max edge factor, despite the entire ideology being a complete contradiction in and of itself"", I decided to go converse with the ""real"" Anarchists about their economic views. 

Long story short, or the more productive you are, the better your state of living will be. I thought Capitalism was the only system resembling that, but apparently my views parallel ""mutualism"", which is sort of a free-market system of Socialism (no private property, so worker owned firms as opposed to private owned firms) where payment is based completely off of productivity, and profits are distributed in a Democratic system. 

To my knowledge, and read a few posts in this subreddit about similar topics. The views that I'm being seen advocated here are all things that I completely agree with.

My question now is simply which of these two very similar ideologies I would identify better as, or something entirely different?",,False,self,t5_2r54y,False,,

&gt; If the criteria by which you judge any political system is how well it treats the person at the bottom (and you are instantly repulsed by someone who comes off as indifferent to that person's plight and greedy to boot) do not fight that. That's a good thing, if we sense that someone has ugly motives beneath the surface (that she doesn't give a fuck), we are going to have a hard time giving any credibility to that shifty person's words.

&gt; If you feel like exploring and challenging yourself (not that you need to or should) go with something that sticks to your core values:

When we hear about someone with a heart problem, we understand there are aspects of their genetic wiring that make them susceptible. Yet when we hear about someone with a drug or alcohol problem, they are all too easily dismissed as weak, self-indulgent, indolent, sinful, narcissistic

That’s one of the questions raised by Clean: Overcoming Addiction and Ending America’s Greatest Tragedy, which described in horrifying detail the descent into life’s basement of his son, Nic, who took his first puff of pot at the age of 12, feasted on pills of all concoctions, later started shooting up cocaine, heroin and crystal meth and subsequently ricocheted between the streets, I should note

Since the 1980s,000 deaths a year - or about five times the number of U.S. military of deaths during the entire Vietnam War or almost forty times the number of US military fatalities in Iraq and Afghanistan.

It is impossible to overestimate the consequences of drug and alcohol addiction on society, HIV or Alzheimer’s. In poorer communities, the problems are viciously accentuated. Beyond the personal tragedies, addiction places a huge hidden tax on America – on our healthcare system, juvenile detention centers, prison systems (which are poorly suited to treat addicts but groan beneath the burden of their incarceration) and, most insidiously

Every day in America,000 people over the age of 12 try drugs or alcohol for the first time. Some teens (and US teens use more than in any other country) have a sip of alcohol or a toke, dislike the taste and are strong enough to shrug off peer pressure or have a good enough relationship with their parents or teachers to seek assistance. But for the unlucky teenager, that early sip, sniff, smoke or snort provokes a mental stimulus that leads to a life of misery. Nine out of ten addicts fall into this dreadful hole because they started using before the age of 18. Lest we forget, about 40% of college students engage in binge drinking which can also lead to long-term calamity. For teenagers, those early experiences are catastrophic. This makes it nearly impossible for many teenagers to stop using. Drug and alcohol use changes the brain.

The perils of drugs and alcohol addiction are faced in every home and workplace. The addict, friend, colleague or boss is often oblivious (frequently for years), sometimes woefully ignorant, often blind to the indisputable scientific evidence, all too eager to offer the benefit of the doubt, and often does not know where to turn for help or whose judgment to trust.

Sheff notes that most doctors have not been trained to recognize the traits of substance abuse – particularly in teenagers where it is most dangerous. For the disease of addiction there is no national center, attention deficit disorders, depression, stress, anxiety, poverty, trauma and broken marriages.

Clean provides an unvarnished portrait of the world of detox centers laced with charlatans and people quicker to separate patients from their money than their habits. He describes the pros and cons of inpatient and outpatient treatment, stresses the importance of intervening as early as possible. For the longer an addict is hooked the more protracted and painful is the treatment.

The baffling catalogs and web listings of available treatments that greet addicts and their families range from the primitive (cutting grass with a pair of scissors) to the ethereal (solitary meditation retreats) and the physical (outdoor wilderness retreats). By contrast, are a complete crapshoot.

Though there are a few bright spots

Maybe we can take some solace from the reversal of one fatal addiction: smoking. The carcinogenic consequences of cigarettes were first highlighted in 1953 and, huge public health campaigns and a hardening of public sentiment have led to a massive improvement. In the last fifty years, the prevalence of smoking in America has dropped by more than half. Doing for drug and alcohol addiction what has been done for smoking will be hard, require large amounts of money and will take several generations. But it’s a fight in which we should all enlist. Remember, addiction is not a choice; it is a gruesome disease. And – like it or not – we are all co-dependents.

The problem is that states tend to become leviathans. The founders in America obviously thought hard about this and wrote an ingenious document with limited power spelled out plainly. But it didn't work- the state eventually became what it is now anyway.

So here is the (new?) idea: the ideal state should have a preconstitution and a constitution. The preconstitution lays down the very basics (think bill of rights)

Basically, is dumped every 20 years and a new one is ratified in its place. Each constitution could actually be more like a ""social contract""- except the people would actually get to sign off on it from time to time.

Anyone ever heard of such an idea? This is really my last burst of political creative thinking before I become a full blown anarchist- so please feel free to comment and critique.

We can get into examples of government overreach, and over-regulating certain industries, on which I'm certain we will probably agree, at least in part, and possible also in principle.
