VicPD Search for Suspects after 11-Year-Old Girls Robbed

Victoria BC – VicPD Detectives are searching for two suspects after a pair of 11-year-old girls were robbed last night just after 5 p.m.

The girls were approached by a man and a woman while walking home from Hillside Mall.  The suspects demanded the girl’s cell phones and backpacks while being threatened. The girls gave their property to the suspects and then ran home. 

Officers combed the area last night and the case is now being investigated by detectives. 

VicPD is looking for any information on the suspects who are described as both being Caucasian, also wearing all black.  She is also described as having shoulder length dark hair.

If you have any information on the suspects

Some back story: A couple of weeks ago I was awakened to the sounds of a fire alarm and people yelling frantically. I looked outside of my bedroom window to see that a tree (about 15 feet away from my balcony) had been set on fire. It was a pretty damn big fire. All of the emergency services arrived at the scene and got everything under control

Fast forward to this morning: An elderly First Nations man and a few other people were conducting some sort of ceremony (I assume having something to do with honouring the tree) with a small, just very unassuming and almost ambient. 

He had been at it for about 20 minutes when a guy who looked to be in his forties approached him, it wasn't some strung out junkie that did this, it was some white collar looking fella with a nice outfit, glasses, etc. It was just really fucked up to me. This elderly native man was literally assaulted for practicing his cultural traditions, during the middle of the day. He was on his small apartment complex's property (with most of his fellow tenants actively participating) when this guy came from outta nowhere. I guess the guy who did it was from my complex. I just want to emphasize just how quiet this ceremony was. They only reason I knew it was happening was because I went out on my balcony to water my plants. So fucked.

I'm sorry if this rant sounds stupid to some of you or whatever, he should have had a permit, they shouldn't push their culture in public blah blah blah..."" But fuck that. For real. He was an old man practicing his fucking cultural beliefs. He wasn't fucking infringing on shit. What the fuck is wrong with a person that fucking resorts to straight-up assault over something so incredibly minuscule?

 I've lived here for 2 years and have never seen anything remotely like it. Anyway

Without wanting to write something way too long and then having to TL;DR it

TL;DR^TL;DR - I lost my job of 6  years last year while waiting for approval through said job for Short Term Disability for long term chronic pain issues.  My wife works, Medical EI, and our bank let us skip a couple of payments while we got out condo ready for market (basic sprucing up).  Our roommate just gave us his notice today a month earlier than expected, and we've had our place up on the market for a month.

If you're looking for a condo in Saanich right near Uptown or a townhouse in Sooke, and myself would be indebted to you.  Even if you just know someone that's looking, or anything, we'd appreciate the help.  I'm a bit hesitant to post the links for the properties, but will send them to redditors who are interested in seeing or sharing.  I probably should be posting this from a throwaway since I'm a pretty open person online and in person, but somehow mixing the two has never done me right.

I suppose now I'm supposed to hold up a sign about the 99% and foreclosure or something and take a picture.

Thanks for anything that you can do.  Even upvoting so people can see this is very appreciated.

Edit:  Thank you so so much everyone.  I'm very thankful that this is getting visibility, and upvote.  I really do.

Edit 2:  Wow.  Thank you again to everyone!  I've had so many messages today, and even the grilling or tough love on this one.  I've always been someone who appreciates straight talk, so it's not lost on me. : )

I've also decided to just man up and post the links.

Victoria BC – VicPD officers are investigating as suspicious incident after a 14-year-old girl was accosted in the 800-block of Rockheights Avenue in Esquimalt late yesterday.

The girl was walking home from a friend’s house at approximately 5:20 p.m. last night when a man, but the man approached from behind and put his arms around her.  

The girl was able to squirm free and noted the man was holding a beer in his hands and appeared intoxicated. He continued to yell obscenities at her as she ran away.

At this time there has been no other similar incidents reported and nothing to suggest that the general public are at risk. The actions of this male are of concern and as such this incident will be investigated thoroughly. 

The man is described as a Caucasian man in his late 20’s to early 30’s. He is approximately 5-foot-10 to 6-feet tall and weighs between 160 pounds and 180 pounds.  He was fair skinned and had stubble on his face. He was wearing a black baggie sweater and had brown

Hey all

The results for our survey are finally in (sort of). My intention was to have all the results compiled/posted by this weekend but my schedule has not permitted me to do so.  
As a result I am simply providing the results in a mostly raw format. All I have done is remove errors and (some) of the junk from the results. It should still give you the information you were looking for though. It's just not as pretty as initially intended.  
  
Once again I apologize for not having this in a ""prettier"" format
  
I will be drawing the names for the free Reddit gold later this evening.  
Thanks. :)

1370561506.0,1ftrw3,Update - Wire strung across trail at Durance not malicious,Mezziah187,40,5,22,"This is the police press release below



This is an update to the Mountain Bike / Wire incident.

A quantity of wire was located at the location where the incident took place.

It would appear from the wire that it has been at that location for many years
probably as many as 30 to 40. The wire itself is a thick gauged wire that likely
dates back to a time when there was active forestry in the area
telegraph wire from an even further distant past.

The wire does not appear to have been recently placed into the tree where it was
secured. There was no evidence of anyone accessing or climbing the tree. The wire
itself appeared to have actually grown into the tree.

This incident did not take place near a maintained or dedicated trail. Information
from another trail user was that the trail is not well used. The trail user
described seeing other people on the trail as unusual
rarely sees anyone in the area.

The wire itself was hanging in a manner that it may have been pulled across the
pathway as a joke; to deter others from continuing on the pathway; or possibly
accidentally by someone that had used the trail previously if it had become snagged
on a bicycle or clothing.

While the circumstances of this incident are concerning
suggest that this was done with any malicious intent on someone's part. Thankfully
the injuries sustained by the mountain bike rider were minor.

The location of the incident was in a wooded area south east of Durrance Lake. CRD
Parks assisted with the investigation into this matter.",self,t5_2rbsy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1ftrw3/update_wire_strung_across_trail_at_durance_not/

Hey folks
As promised I have a finally put together the survey. Took longer than planned as I had little free time this week.  
  
I have done my best to include all the (serious) suggestions made by you guys. If I missed something from that thread please let me know as it was likely accidental.  
  
I have opted to use Google Forms to collect the data as it makes things easier on me in the end.  You **DO NOT** need to be logged in to answer the questions.  

Answer as many or as few of the categories as you'd like. Please try to provide only one answer per category.  
  
In a week I will be selecting ~~3~~ 5 random users to receive a month or Reddit Gold. Just because I'm nice like that.  If you'd like to enter just leave your Reddit username as the answer to the final question.  I will be not comparing results with usernames.  
  
I will leave this survey up until next Monday at the earliest.
  
Thanks!

**EDIT1**: Those of you answering *nothing* but the part to enter your username to win gold
**EDIT2**: Some of your responses are hilarious. I love it!

We'd made a reso. and the people before us were having too good of a time to leave so they had trouble seating us at first. 
We didn't wait long though and while we waited they made sure we all had drinks and were happy. 



*PROS:* 

- The food was DELICIOUS!!! I had the bacon cheese burger and it was one of the best burgers I've had in awhile (Also I highly recommend the onion nest) and everything is very reasonably priced.  
- wings: 75 cents a wing is not too bad when they taste that good. Chipotle Maple... best. 
- We didn't wait long in line (despite it looking like the line was long at first).
- The drinks were cheap ($5 for a strong bow!)
- the service was exceptionally friendly and relaxed for such a packed house. 
- Don't tell anyone
- He has an accent... so.. ladies??



*CONS:* 

- I think they were hoping there would be more a turnover... but a lot of the customers were drinking pitchers and eating wings and definitely not going anywhere!  (Maybe if it stays that way they'd consider just not taking reservations??)

/r/victoriabc

I have never seen such a piss poor attempt at organizing an event in my life.

We were there for over an hour and a half before anybody mentioned what we were even THINKING OF DOING on Saturday. Nothing was properly communicated to the people that were there for the 1st time.

Other than the core group of organizers

Despite being lead by a self-appointed committee, debate, debate until EVERYBODY AGREES.

**The dictatorship of the lowest common denominator.**

Here's how it went down:

1. 25 minutes of randomly talking among ourselves

2. 30 minutes of mostly ultra-leftist circle jerk speeches

3. 20 minutes arguing about whether or not we should be able to take pictures ('because some people aren't comfortable or have criminal records'...wtf?)

4. People started getting frustrated because nobody knew what was going on
5. After another 15 minutes of arguing about photographs

6. We all split up into the groups of our choice

It was essentially a giant left wing circle jerk consisting of anarchists, and a few others. 

Most of the 'organizers' didn't seem to have any qualms with an infinitely long discussion that lead absolutely nowhere while employed people with kids and real responsibilities couldn't quite wrap their heads around wtf was going on

Don't get me wrong

**TL;DR: Anarchists couldn't organize themselves out of a box if their lives depended on it.**

Posted by VicPDCanada on behalf of Saanich Police:

Saanich Police are presently investigating an abduction attempt in the Gordon Head area. Initial responding officers were sent as a result of multiple 911 calls made from the area at about 6:30 pm. 

Officers confirmed the involvement of a vehicle, with BC license plate EG 7652 attached. The van is described as being marked with typical UHAUL advertising on the side similar to $18.95 a day or something close to that.

If anybody sees this vehicle they are encouraged to not approach it but call 911 immediately. Saanich Police Major Crimes Unit detectives have been called in to conduct the investigation. 

It is not expected that any further information will be released this evening. Calls to to the media cell and the Watch NCO will not be entertained about this incident.

UVic ECS 3rd Floor.
January 27 @5PM
48 hours
[Poster](http://globalgamejam.org/sites/default/files/locationImages/ggj_poster_2012.png?1325668101)
An [IGDA](http://www.igda.org/) event




**What is a Game Jam?**

[From the pouty lips of Mr. Andy Moore](http://www.orcajam.com/): 

A bunch of like-minded people get together and work on what they love - games - for 48 hours.

Not everyone stays up the full 48 hours straight (we like to promote healthy sleeping!)

So come on out and meet people from the industry.. Hang out and work on your own projects, start to finish, in 48 hours!

Programmers! Artists! Audio Engineers! Board game designers! Anyone interested in game development at all should come; team up with your newfound friends and make something amazing!

**Where is it?! When is it?! Oh god

The 3rd floor of the UVic Engineering and Computer Science Building. I said it up there. Hello? Remember? The keynote begins at 5PM. I said that the event was a 48 hour event, which is costly. It will run late into the night, and start early in the morning.

**Price of Entry**

Free! But there will be a box for donations if you are feeling charitable. Any donations received will be used to help offset the cost of organizing the event. If there is a profit on the event

**But I'm not a Programmer...**

Bring Settlers of Catan. I want to play that game. Like... you bring a bro

Bring a board game. Bring a game you love. Game Jams are more exciting when there are more people so just come and hang out for a while.

However

**Okay so wait

This *is* real life! Here is the list of events!

*Uvic GameDev presents Minecraft!* 
You know the dril. Play with a friend

*Board Game Jam*
 - Use existing board game pieces

*5 Minute Game Jam* 
- Making a Game (or piece of music) in 5 minutes; The results can be absolutely incredible. It is a spectator sport upon itself. My weapon of choice

*Show and Tell*
 - Showcase some of the best games that have come out of Victoria in the last few years!

**I'm interested in doing some game development

I suggest using these free Game Making utilities:

[Game Maker Lite](http://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker/windows)
- Perfect for someone who has not programmed at all. Simple and powerful drag and drop interface

[Adventure Game Studios](http://www.adventuregamestudio.co.uk/)
- Versatle and intuitive for Point and Click Adventure Game Development. Free to use, or game development experience prior.

**What's the 'sitch on internet? Food?**

I am working towards getting stable internet access available for all attendees. Unfortunately, if you are A UVic student, you'll have no problem using the school computers.

[Kano Apps](http://www.kanoapps.com/careers/), supplies may be limited. You might want to bring some food, especially if you plan on developing a game.

**Okay! I want in!**

Go to the Global Game Jam website and register so you can post your game and your game's screenshots online. Remember, use the #GGJ and #screenshotsaturday tags to meet new awesome people just like you. After the event, post your games on the [LEVEL UP](http://www.meetup.com/levelup/) forums!


See you there. :)

The 19-year-old and her 22-year-old friend were just leaving Mayfair mall when they were approached by the suspect who asked for the time. When the one of the victims took out her cell phone to check

The suspect then demanded all her cash and the phone. The victims started to give their property

Detectives are concerned as this robbery closely mimics one last week where two 11-year-old girls were robbed of their cell phones near Hillside mall and investigators believe that the two may be related.

This similarity in these cases has Detectives issuing a warning to the public about personal electronic devices. They are hoping that the public can be extra vigilant in the use of cell phones

The suspect in this robbery is described as a woman

Detectives are looking for any tips or information that may help them solve this crime. Please contact VicPD at the non-emergency line of 250-995-7654 or Crime Stoppers at 1-800-222-TIPS (8477).

I have lived here for 8 years and have noticed that car accidents involving seniors (especially hitting pedestrians and cyclists) Is a FAR too common occurrence. 

The scariest part: I work at a medical clinic where senior citizens ROUTINELY must come in and take an eye test as well as a cognitive awareness and general health check in order for them to be able to drive.  Many times I have checked their vision myself and noted that there is NO WAY IN HELL they should be driving!!!  But in my 8 years at medical clinics I have only ever seen 2 instances (out of 100s of exams) where licenses have been immediately revoked.  If the physician won't revoke their licences

How you can help:
1. Go to www.dressbetter.co and sign up to be reminded to vote during the voting period (Nov 21-27)
2. Share what we are doing with others who might help us with voting
3. Give us some feedback on where else we could be sharing this to help rally support by Wednesday!

  I REALLY wanted to have a firefighter drop by or visit a fire hall but the first person I called hung up on me and the second said they do not allow tours for our age group.

  Little kids LOVE fire trucks so it would be incredibly amazing if someone would be willing to drop by with one. If that is not possible I would like a firefighter to come in uniform so the children could familiarize themselves with a full fire suit.

  The children I work with are 2.5 to 4 years old and this age group will sometimes hide during a fire because a fire suit can look scary. I would like to prevent that.

  Remember these kids are little and have the attention span of gnats. Short simple sentences and mentioning something they can relate to is all it takes to enthrall them. Which means any visit would be short (ie; we wouldn't take too much of your time).

  Who knows you may be the one to inspire the new generation. ",self,t5_2rbsy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/12hlsk/daycare_kids_need_a_hero_any_firefighters/

I was thinking it'd be nice to have a BBQ at a beach or park sometime next month. The idea is that someone would bring a BBQ, buns, condiments/dressings) and maybe other snacks. People could bring their own drinks/sides. We could just collect a bit of cash to pay for the fuel + grill food.

1. How does this idea sound? Do you think this set-up would be good

2. Does anybody know for sure where BBQs are allowed

3. What days would work best for y'all?

4. Does anybody have a BBQ they could bring and (at least help) man?

I have called commonwealth pool and given them my number so if you would like to call them and ask for it they should give it to you so you can call me. If they refuse to give you my number for whatever reason then PM and we can go about things that way. 

I am scared of returning it to the wrong person only to have it jail broken so please be prepared to describe the home screen image.

Background
Family: Wife, me (American)
Current Home: Adelaide
Previous Home: Arizona
Wife: Physician
Me: Remote technology worker

We've been living in Australia for the past two years and have decided it is time to get back to the northern hemisphere. We will be moving to Victoria around Jan/Feb 2013 and I was hoping to get some advise and feedback on some things. 

I've previously visited the island looking at possible destinations and we've narrowed our location to the greater Victoria area

I was hoping to get a rundown of the various neighborhoods around the area. We are looking for a nice quiet place to raise kids that has really good schools and the such. Recreational centers are a huge plus (like the Oak Bay Rec Center). As an aside

Our hobbies are outdoorsy in nature. Hiking, basketball, weight lifting/fitness and getting into hockey (we are all taking skating lessons and I'm learning hockey). 

As for work

I'm a (remote) technologist; ruby, erlang etc etc. Typical jack of all trades kind of person. Would love to get a feel for what people are doing on the island. 

Another thing

Thanks
J

I was leaving Thrifty foods (exit on Mackenzie Ave) and turned right onto Shelbourne St. from Mackenzie Ave, still travelling north. A silver Nissan car belonging to Mr. XX was pulling out of the University Heights Shopping Mall parking lot onto Shelbourne St. and was turning left. His intentions were to turn left onto Shelbourne street and also head in the North direction, the same direction as myself. As Mr. XX was pulling onto Shelbourne St. he hit the driver’s side door and left fender with the front bumper of his vehicle, as he was trying to get into the lane I was occupying. His passenger side front corner of his vehicle was also damaged in the process. Both vehicles have minor damage consisting mostly of scratches and one small dent on my driver door. Mr. XX and I pulled into the parking lot at The Kensington retirement village. We exchanged information, and while doing so he threatened me that he was going to try and make it seem like the accident was my fault and continued to try and place the blame on me, even though I had the right of way as I was through traffic and he was pulling out of the mall parking lot. His actual words were: “Well I’m going to make it your fault.” and “You better not make a claim with ICBC.”


If any of you know where I'm talking about on Shelbourne and Mackenzie, maybe this will ring a bell for anyone who was around:




Oh and I lurked on this guy's facebook and his favourite things are Jersey Shore, and MMA. If that is some more motivation to help me get this liar. He has a bunch of pictures of himself after a bar fight with black eyes. Such a tough guy! Anyways, any help would be greatly appreciated!! Thanks so much I know Reddit is awesome and will come through for me!

**UPDATE 1:** Well ICBC says it is looking good for me as they have caught him in a few lies. I'm still a bit worried they'll take the best route out for them which would be ""inconclusive evidence to support either claim, I didn't mean to offend anyone with the jersey shore comments, just that it made sense for me when a 6""3 giant dude yells and tries to intimidate a 5""6 tiny chick. Now I understand why he thinks it's cool to get in bar fights and brag about it on FB. I just needed clarity for myself because I was shaking for like, 4 hours when I got home from this. Also, thanks for all of your support! I should find out what happens at the end of this week or early next week the final decision and will update you again for all of those who care :) Also, I removed the link to my album on the advice of some of you guys as I don't want anything linking back to me, if you catch my drift. Thanks again!

**UPDATE #2:** yay! ICBC didn't even need me to come in because a) my report made it very clear as to what happened and the damage to our vehicles coincided with what I said, especially over something I know I didn't do. I'm glad it worked out and he's paying for 100% of the damage! Thanks again :)",,False,self,t5_2rbsy,True,,

&gt;April 12

&gt;Police in Saanich arrested a man after a string of suspected arsons last night -- that included a fire at the Accent Inn near Blanshard and Cloverdale that left the attached restaurant destroyed and forced hotel guests out of the building.

&gt;The first fire was a dumpster fire off Duplin Road a little before 10 o'clock last night. The the ABC restaurant at the Accent Inn went up in flames near 11 o'clock last night.

&gt;Acting Battalion Chief with the Saanich Fire Department Dale Peebles says flames were pouring through the metal roof of the building when he arrived.

&gt;""The restaurant was basically destroyed in this fire.""

&gt;One firefighter suffered an injury to his finger. All the hotel guests got out safely but could not return to their rooms.

&gt;**After the Accent Inn case two more suspected arson fires were lit in the Burnside Road East area around two o'clock this morning - one a garage fire and another small blaze on a property. Police swarmed the area and arrested a man believed to be behind all the fires but the investigation is still ongoing this morning.**",self,t5_2rbsy,1365770077.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/VictoriaBC/comments/1c73wh/whats_going_on_in_saanichvictoria_booms_and_a_ton/

I'll start of by doing a TLDR(summary); worst meal in town where is it?

My son and I have had an annual tradition since he was about 12 years old to go out to the uggliest dingiest restaurants in our hometown (Kelowna) and eat the most unappetizing plates of food. Why? Because when my son was younger he would complain so often- begging for my wife(his step mom) and I to take him out for dinner. His birth mom fed him lots of fast food because she thought that it was an appropriate way to get my son to like her more then me (sigh). In order to punish his attitude I started taking him to the worst looking places in town and ordering the grossest food for a few weeks straight

Everything is going well

One thing you should know:  I used to work in a job where security was super, really, secure passwords. Like, fifteen digit random strings of characters and digits that are different for every system I had to use. I still use that method for really, really, important web sites.  Internet banking is one of those really important websites.

So


**Seven Digits**

No letters

Just seven digits.  A total key space of 9

When I was a kid we used to hack into Camosun's VAX/VMS system with our 2400 baud modems so we could use this new-fangled thing called the Internet. They used to require only an 8 letter password.   It was easy; 8 letters took my 386 PC  only a few days to break...

But

Have you heard of  World of Warcraft?  It's a really popular game. Lots of people like to hack their site and so they need additional security for their **fake money that doesn't mean anything**. 

Blizzard offers *Authenticators.*  These are either physical FOB's that you attach to a key chain or applications you run on your phone that change your password every few seconds.

You know

My bank? My Fucking **BANK**? Where I keep my money?!!?  You think they offer FOB's?

The teller -- and again

A **phone number**

Hey

A)  Log into their account because **the username for their account is the same as the number on their bank card for fuck sake**  You know

B) Use the numbers in their phone as their password: Their number,  or can look up the number they had growing up as their password. (Not hard to find with their full name....)

But, school they went to as a child, or father's middle name.. 

Which you can check on Facebook since you have their phone. 

Holy crap.

Anyhow.  Sorry to bother you with my rant.  But they **REALLY** need to fix the security for their website.

Seriously.

I made the mistake of entering EB Games and was almost overwhelmed by the smell.  It reminded me of a janitor's closet where the mop heads hadn't been cleaned/properly dried in years - the smell of mildew and foulness.  

I couldn't tell if it was the store (carpets desperately in need of cleaning) or the customers (it was fairly busy).

Is this normal for this location? for EB Games in general (perhaps a scent they spray)? For video game stores in general? Or just a bad day for customer reekage?
