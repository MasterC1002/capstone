----------------------

*This just in...*

* **[What was I Sahin?](http://i.imgur.com/mlD26.jpg)**

Sadly after months of failing to break into the first team Nuri Sahin
[has left Liverpool for a return to Dortmund](http://i.imgur.com/Jwm2y.gif)

After battling Arsenal for his signature and only playing a handful of games many fans were left wondering why we bothered to take him loan him in the first place

* **Forren on the verge of sig..No? who?..Southampton!? seriously

With a name straight out of Lord of the Rings and a hair cut to match

Reports have come out since then that suggest he has canceled the trial and has signed for Southampton.. [but we aint mad

* **[Sneijder shows Dutch Courage](http://i.imgur.com/w5Usw.jpg)**

This weeks wild card is world class midfielder Sneijder.. ^^not ^^like ^^we ^^already ^^had ^^a ^^much ^^cheaper
^^even ^^though ^^its ^^a ^^fucking ^^joke.. the dutch maestro has publicly said he wants out of Inter and he's available for only 9m! 

*'9m for a world class player!? are you sure ElevenReds?'* Yes

but he comes with a catch.. [a MASSIVE £200

With Allen and Jonjo failing to find form and Suso too young to be counted on [we may have no choice but to pay up..](http://i.imgur.com/zKBKH.gif)

BR has admitted that Liverpool's spending policy in recent years when its come to wages ['could have been better handled'](http://i.imgur.com/7uaxn.gif)

* **[Cole does best and heads West](http://i.imgur.com/6Gi2O.jpg)**

After months of protesting in the middle east
once and for all!](http://i.imgur.com/qkfZa.gif)

However

* **Time To Try

2 weeks in and we're still after a player that many considered to be a done deal..at first what seemed to be a decided 4m deal has risen to to a reported 6m

Fans are divided

* **..and he lived happily ever Afra**

Newcastle's Ben Afra has been linked with Liverpool after publicly saying he wishes to leave. After an outstanding season last year Newcastle have failed to regain their incredible form and the sale of their key players have seen them fall down to a place [that only the Hubble telescope can see them](http://i.imgur.com/Mb0O4.gif). 

* **[Move your Assaidi](http://i.imgur.com/hQZbR.jpg)**

A lot of talk has emerged of Liverpool's mysterious player Known as Assaidi heading on loan to Ajax or Galatasaray. The player who has had very limited playing time in his 6 months here

As of right now Assaidi is at the ACoN with Morocco 


--------------------------

*In Other News..*

-------------------------


* **[Gerrard is not down with the kids](http://i.imgur.com/Mqbm9.jpg)**

There was wide debate that Gerrards performance in recent years has been declining with age
he's been storming the [assist table with 8 placing him top](http://i.imgur.com/wqrmq.gif).

In an Interview Gerrard was asked how he felt about playing in such a young squad to which he responded
that he didn't think playing a young squad would get results. 

* **Sturridge 2 for 2 on debuts**

Well

The first time since Suarez has a player we've bought has lived up to early to the hype and in some spectacular fashion! 2 goals in 2 first appearances from Sturridge
has fans foaming at the mouth over his potential. Still early days but thanks to [Chelsea's tight spending policy](http://i.imgur.com/bo8D1.gif) LFC were able
to bring in this highly rated undervalued striker in for just 12m!

* **[Suarez Hands us a win](http://i.imgur.com/BZ382.jpg)**

Suarez was again making headlines but for all the wrong reasons after he was seen handling the ball before he scored against Mansfield [sending us through to the next
round despite angry calls for a replay](http://i.imgur.com/DAdu2.gif).

While rival fans maintain the argument their teams consist of saints that would have admitted to the offence
to defend Suarez. [Nobody could argue with his explanation of the situation..](http://i.imgur.com/ah0qW.gif) 

* **Sing your Carrolls

Andy Carroll when asked what team he'll be playing for next summer replied 'Liverpool'...[yep](http://i.imgur.com/pKnRM.gif)

* **Grab Your Coat Suso

In the last week 3 LFC players have threatend to deactivate their twitter accounts (Enrique
to harassment online.

Some have said they are just overreacting and should ignore them
[how to handle situations like these](http://i.imgur.com/SDbIY.gif)

http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/15atk4/daniel_sturridge_to_have_medical_at_liverpool_on/

I kept arguing on every Sturridge thread backing Liverpool on the great signing they had made

People kept calling him ""selfish""

http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/15atk4/daniel_sturridge_to_have_medical_at_liverpool_on/c7ky7it


&gt; ""The same people will be coming back to this thread and admitting they were wrong come Summer. Then they themselves will act all high and mighty claiming they always believed in him. 12m for him is a bargain.""

And how right I was. If you open this latest thread about Sturridge 

http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1e6r63/daniel_sturridge_has_now_scored_more_goals_in_his/

It now has comments saying ""Sturridge for England."" and of course you can see where this is going.

______

So congratulations Liverpool on acquiring such a great talent. The best is still yet to come from him. You will indeed have the last laugh. Hopefully see you back in the champions league at the expense of the other two fuckers from London soon.

Liverpool is my second favorite club at the end of the day behind Atletico Madrid

During the start of the 2011/12 season, Simeone knew at the very start of his time at Atleti that this young Brazilian was going to have a shout in his team.

Very technical, good strength, and having quite the eye for goal made Costa our first choice striker for the better half of the 12/13 season when Falcaos' form started to dip combined with a few injuries keeping him out of the first team. Costa can play on the wings quite proficiently, slowly but surely though he has made that CF position all his own. He was an integral part of our Copa Del Ray win this year over Real Madrid, notching 7 goals and 2 assists en route to the final as well as scoring in the final itself. Overall throughout the season, in which he was only a starter for the second half, he scored 20 goals and gave 15 assists.

Diego Costa only received this reputation of being a ""hot head"" in the last year. He has been very misunderstood, getting the opposition all riled up so that they would be more prone to make mistakes. He's quite the intelligent footballer for only being 24 years old.

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvll_n4wWDs) a video of his exploits from this last season. And [another](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zCXIIfpjTK4&amp;feature=youtu.be). To me, he might be more realistic of a target for Pool in the January window, or even next summer. From what I've seen so far in our three friendly matches this summer, Costa isn't looking a shadow of his former self, he's looking twice the player he was last season and all of us at Atletico have very high hopes for him. He was by far the best player this season for Atletico Madrid, sure maybe didn't score as many goals as Falcao, but he did a lot more for the team in addition to 20 goals and 15 assists he gave this season.

**TL;DR He's definitely misunderstood,False,self,t5_2qn0o,1375390531.0,,,t3_1jipmy

1) **Martin Kelly**- He stopped to sign. Rather quiet though

2)**Daniel Agger**- He stopped to sign. Saw his YNWA tattoo up close. Seemed a nice guy.

3)**Stuart Downing**- He stopped to sign. Didnt seem too into it though.

4)**Ryan Mclaughlin**- LOL none of the other scouse guys knew who he was but i recognized him and got his autograph. Was rather pleased with myself.

5)**Steven Gerrard**- Didnt stop. The security guy told me he rarely does. Somewhat downtrodden to hear this.

6)**Brad Jones**- Didnt stop. Nothing else to say haha.

7)**Jose Enrique**- Surprisingly didnt stop.

8)**Hendo**- Stopped and was one of the nicest lads. 

9)**Glen Johnson**- Stopped but looked fucking pissed. Was told that he rarely stops.

10)**Adam Morgan and Craig Roddan**- were together but didnt stop because no one but me recognized them haha

11)**Jon Flanagan and Jack Robinson**- were together(of course haha) and were glad to be stopped. talked to both about their various england exploits this summer.

12)**Simon Mignolet

13) **Spearing**- Didnt stop. Think i saw his gps in the car set for blackburn? 

14)**Raheem Sterling**- wouldnt have stopped but for a crazy lady jumping in front of his car

15) **Coutinho**- literally the nicest one. I spoke spanish to him and he understood somewhat. Very personable; got the sense he would have waited even if 100 people were lined up outside his car.

16) **Skrtel**- Stopped but literally didnt say a word

17) **Lucas**- Surprisingly didnt stop. I think it was because we were gathered around another players car and he saw the opportunity to go unnoticed haha.

18)**Wisdom**- Didnt stop; was somehow driving a porsche? Can't imagine his wages are that high.

19)**Joe Allen**- Another one of the really nice ones. Stopped and chatted about his recovery from shoulder surgery.

20)**Kolo**- Was being driven

21) **Borini**- stopped and was very nice. A bit quiet though.

22)**Brendan**- What a lad. Stopped and chatted. I asked about suarez and he said ""we'll see"". Also asked about eriksen/alderweireld and got the same answer. Also

**Players Missing**: Suso, Coates, Suarez. A few of the u18 lads had their moms pick them up ahahaha. They looked so embarrassed in front of their teammates.

Only got pictures with bendan and hendo as my phone was dying and i needed it to navigate my way back to my hotel! Also got a few pics of the liver bird and the docks.

I know this is a huge deal. It's inexcusable and as much as I love the guy I hope Suarez gets a lengthy ban (if not from the FA then the club). It pissed me off big time when I saw it; we all thought he'd turned a corner after BR spoke to him earlier in the season. But he's obviously still our little controversial Uruguayan.

Now, surely this is his last game in a red shirt""

No.

Suarez isn't going anywhere; nor should you want him to. He's our best player. Our reputation would be in tatters without him

But you know what? Without his work rate this season we'd be in the bottom half of the table (probably not far off the relegation battle) and Rodgers might not even still be around. I don't care if every couple of months he gets the club into an utter shitstorm of controversy

**Mock the week** 

* Liverpool have certianly [been busy this window!](http://i.imgur.com/w0qTK.gif) Luis Alberto

* Liverpool owners earlier this week came out and made it very clear that suarez is not for sale. On his twitter account John Henry famously tweeted ''*what are they smoking over there at the Emirates?*'' much to the amusement of the footballing world

* In their desperation

* It's also worth noting that not only have Arsenal failed to capture Suarez but [any of their transfer targets this window..were not bitter about it though](http://i.imgur.com/4V3sysu.gif)

* This week Reina secured a loan move to Napoli. While there were mixed feelings between liverpool and Reina

* Many fans were questioning whether or not BR's young player policy could actually work and provide results so during the pre season all eyes were on Coutinho

* Despite his age

* Kolo Toure made a fine start to his liverpool career helping us not concede a single goal during our preseason friendlies

* Just as liverpool secured the signing of Luis Alberto, while Everton have to send theirs back, [we get to keep ours](http://i.imgur.com/ErntEPo.gif)

----------------------

**The Rumour Mill:**

* Liverpool are reported to have lined up a deal to bring Left back Lorenzo Melgarejo over from Benfica on loan. The 22 year old would certainly fit our transfer criteria and as we only have 1 injury prone/reliable left back

* Even though we've been linked more times than a switch board

* ...oh and despite all hope being lost earlier in the window

* This week's wildcard has the same likelihood of happening as us getting bought out by north korea

--------------------------

**CALM DOWN**

But really we have nothing to fear. If we sell, and we can make a lesser marquee signing,  perhaps.

Suarez isn't the type of guy that goes on strike. He loves playing way too much. And besides, which is still higher than most players on the pitch.

I've seen so many level-headed fans here who completely loses it when Suarez opens his mouth. It's his personality

So please. When he speaks

---

Guys I'm not telling you how to feel. I'm saying: Don't start a witch hunt. The way you guys react is much more emotional and angry than it is supposed to be. Suarez is an ass. I know. Deal with it. You knew this when we bought him, especially when he cared enough to carry the team. The guy has said nothing but good things about Liverpool, and it's fans, but he wants out. WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH WANTING TO MOVE AWAY, WHEN SUAREZ HAS BEEN HERE A GOOD 3 YEARS WITHOUT CHAMPIONS LEAGUE? I don't find anything he is saying disrespectful. You guys are blowing this completely out of proportion. I think the fact that he's saying he wants to play elsewhere while *not* turning in a transfer request, means that he's open for a move but he'll stay if he has to. Remember, other clubs have to match the release clause, and basically turn him into yet another superstar striker. We've done it before

There is going to be a lot of talk going on about this club. LFC is linked with more players and stories during the transfer windows and off season than ANY other team for the past 3 years straight. There will be talk about Suarez, probably Eriksen, probably Ronaldo, Messi - you get the idea.

We all get the idea. Most of you know how it works around here

First off: anything LFC related posted here from The S*n or DailyMail will be napalmed working about 12 seconds. Trust me

Second: CHECK YOUR SOURCES. Jay78LFC on Twitter is not a ""source"". A source is directly from the mouth of a person and is properly referenced/cited within the article.

For example: CaughtOffside released HUNDREDS of transfer rumors this past January - of which literally NONE of them were true/accurate. None of their material was sourced.

Press loves the press. See the same story twice? Check the sources - chances are UNLESS they're from the BBC

On that note
Third: check this Subreddit! Because the same material can come from a number of news sources

Fourth: The Daily Speculation thread.

You've probably seen these. A lot of people around here have done GREAT work recently organizing a daily post to include any and all news/rumor/transfer related material into one convenient post where it can all be seen and discussed.

Please feel free to include anything I may have forgotten or if there's something else you can think of to keep the peace.

Reminder: this is a self-post

[So we didn't get him..](http://i.imgur.com/8zr5cn9.gif)

Despite all the speculation and Gerrard saying publicly he'd like him at Liverpool the hunt for Sneijder is over.

Sneidjers reason for choosing Galatasaray over us was that he wanted to compete for trophies (although we all know that Gal were willing to pay him more) LFC fans weren't too upset but it's widely agreed that Sneijder could have [worded his explanation better..](http://i.imgur.com/xDXBl.jpg)

* **[BR to buy Brazilian Boy from Italians because of his ball control](http://i.imgur.com/Cnx6mWg.jpg)**

Philippe Coutinho

Tipped to be a great future prospect, buy for tomorrow policy, however Inter arnt willing to let their potential future star go so quickly and BR was said to be a little frustrated over the amount of time Coutinho asked for [so he 'could think about it'](http://i.imgur.com/QyazU.gif)

If this rumor turns out to be true and with new arrival Sturridge in beast mode

* **There's no place like Loan**

[...Offers have been made for Coates](http://i.imgur.com/dtPn9.gif)

Dont worry its only on loan! In a recent interview Coates said he's feeling frustrated at a lack of chances in the first team and a loan to Wigan could end up being a win - win as it'll give him the playing time and development he wants while we can continue to play our strongest team.

* **You may take our Lives

Scottish Youngster Danny Wilson has also gone on loan

* **Tom Ince to stay Black^^pool**

The once sought after Blackpool players is quickly falling our of favor

* **Long to Reina over us**

So this just in

*In the News this week

--------------------------

* [**Gerrard gets praised at writers award**](http://assets2.lfcimages.com/uploads/_jm_1523.jpg)

Deservedly so and long over due Gerrard received an award from the Football writers association for his contributions to football. Among the praise and the question about his long storied career one writer how does he feel the Champions league football compares to the Europa league [to which Gerrard responded..](http://i.imgur.com/jTu2h.gif)

* **Fabio is fabiolous**

Fabio Borini this week stated that despite his injury his Liverpool Career starts now. The 21 year old Italian was BR first buy at LFC but was quickly out of action after breaking his foot on international duty

Thankfully Luis Suarez stepped his game and didn't get injured and in his most recent game, he's back.](http://i.imgur.com/fPihK.gif)

* **Norwich to press abuse charges against Liverpool**

[Liverpool smashed Norwich 5-0...](http://i.imgur.com/8zFXS.gif)

while Suarez did what he does best and ripped the defense to pieces it was the work of Sturridge that surprised everyone. The new arrival scored and is now on 3 goal in 3 appearances for the reds and a lot of the doubters that were worried that Daniel wasn't the player we needed now consider him to be [the perfect accomplice to our current gunslinger Suarez](http://i.imgur.com/UoNKn.gif) 

* **Hendo goal the best thing since Borini's pizza**

Henderson form recently has been phenomenal! His volly against Norwich [left a lot of people in disbelief](http://i.minus.com/ibydpDUXpX4sU5.gif)

Despite a lot of fans thinking he would never live up to the hype

* **Downing on the Up and up**

Well fuck me..he's certainly winning a lot of people over.

Despite still being a major flop in terms of contribution he's certainly putting in more of an effort to go out on a high but a lot of fans still think he'll be best off else where. [A lot of people are asking what the fuck took him so long](http://i.imgur.com/GQQGc.gif)

For those of you who are new during the transfer window we like to come together and have some fun at the expense at all the transfer speculation going on. 

Welcome to the world of bad puns

So according to reports

* [Fresh reports link Liverpool with a shock loan move for PSG striker Gameiro](http://i.imgur.com/gUKkK.gif) although an already established player with recent new arrivals at PSG the striker has found himself out of favor and keen to find playing time.

**[Sturridge shows courage](http://i.imgur.com/5EAST.jpg):**

**[Down n' out:](http://i.imgur.com/2Y8mT.jpg):**

* Despite Downing trying..and trying....and trying for over 2 seasons now he's never managed to fill the gap left by Kuyt

**[Nothing but the best since Tom Ince left:](http://i.imgur.com/vLhK6.jpg)**

* Likely to replace him is [**former** Liverpool academy player Tom Ince](http://i.imgur.com/cKr2i.gif). Despite leaving 18 months ago for 250

**Quick Round up:**


* Rumors were circling that BR would be willing to keep Joe Cole if he took a substantial pay cut..[Joe Cole and his Agent said they would '*Think about it'*](http://i.imgur.com/mem8e.gif)

This is a one time use account but I feel like I owe a lot of you an explanation

Im truly shocked and humbled by your response

I've said it many times before
but i do so because I love interacting with you and this community. You are all such a positive
interesting and good looking people that I actually enjoy being part of it and I have never found a community
anywhere else that comes close to you. 

(*soppy and emotional*

---------------------------

* **The Downing Situation:**

You all know about the Downing post by now
TV that Sunderland were interested on taking Downing out on Loan. SD being a hot topic I made the post
with the expectation that things were going to escalate and more information would come out during the day
but it didn't. 

The rumor (like so many others during EVERY TW) turned out to be false and people were left with a post 
from me that they couldn't quite understand.

The Title 'Wait for the media to confirm it

*How I intended it to read;*

'**wait for the media to confirm it**

this group knew I was posting a Transfer
Rumor and that despite the hype (I was expecting to escalate) we should wait until it is confirmed.

*How a lot of members read it;*

' ^^wait ^^for ^^the ^^media ^^to ^^confirm ^^it

this group assumed I had
made some kind of ITK official statement
people still wont get it in their heads that I am NOT an ITK.

I had no access to the internet or TV all day so by time I got home and went to check up on things
shocked to see no new news on the rumor/transfer on Downing. Having spent a long time on this sub
and assumed that somebody would have found a few website links or reports that gave more information on the rumor
(like what happens in most rumor posts here) and posted them in the comments. 

Nope. 

There was almost nothing on the story and it looked like I pulled the rumor from thin air and thankfully
and a long time after I made the post somebody found a [twitter link from a journalist that backed that there WAS
a Downing to Sunderland on loan rumor](https://twitter.com/JNorthcroft/status/290181961480286208) even if it was
false.

By then It didn't matter. Of course there were some justifiably angry people and I don't blame them for being upset
I apologized for the cryptic message and for leaving everybody confused and then explained myself. 
But their were some who just used it as fuel to the fire for their already well established personal hatred of me.

* **The PM situation:**

I've said in the past and to the people that PM me to talk
they bothered me

Yesterday seemed to be the tipping point for a lot of the guys that didn't like me, evidence, further information all standard reasonable PM's.

The rest however ranged from bitter to just pure cuntish, your lying about your grandparents dying and illness to get attention blah blah blah..

That of course was a quick summary of the topics they covered and it may not sound devastating when listed like that but there were one or two PM's that got really, where I lived, family info.. all this because they just didn't like me and my post, I was seriously shocked and with how things at home had been going I found it all a bit too much and decided I had enough.

* **Deleting ElevenReds and the response:**

I deleted the account early in the morning and no more than 20 minutes later somebody had noticed and reported it to everybody else (SwingYaGucciRag

I got in touch with the Mods who were brilliant and have been brilliant since I first signed up as ElevenReds

I wasn't going to get in direct contact with you guys for a few months while things settled down but after coming by  to see whats going on during LFC vs UNITED day I was shocked

I read through every bodies comments

* **The Good

**The Good**

A lot of the comments were great to hear, I merely create the posts **YOU** guys and girls of the community make them work and worthwhile and when I comment I just try to speak honestly but respectfully as to why I think what I think. There are also a lot of contributors, posters and commenters that contribute as much and a lot more than I do and I think its very unfair people single me out and not them.

Some people seem to think I think Im never wrong or I only get upvoted based on my name but the truth is I get put in my place and corrected all the time, people since the first YNWSA have downvoted me regardless of what I post or say just because Im ElevenReds, regardless people who do like me love to challenge what I think and say not out of spite but to improve everyone's understanding on the point im trying to make and to help me improve it. 

**The Bad:**

The infamous Walcott and Huntelaar posts... the same thing that gets brought up whenever a transfer post and my name gets brought up and yet most people completely misunderstood the posts and the point I was getting at..

Yes, I then said **in my own opinion based on the information at the time** that I believed we'd sign one of them if not both of them, that was my personal belief. I also mentioned that for any deal both sides have to agree and that situations and circumstances change but people forget to mention me saying that, regardless Huntelaar changed his mind yet Walcott is still in question but it looks like he's getting ready to settle at Arsenal. Yet some people refuse to let this go and bring up old comments from months ago, like I tell them I had to base my opinions on the info available at the time but I apologize for getting peoples hopes up.

**The Ugly:** 

Im not an ITK... of any kind

Using my past and current employment situation as leverage in discussion or for intimidating people against disagreeing with me: I will NEVER EVER do that ever on anyone

some people are getting angry at how people have reacted to me deleting my account

We got Lucas back and immediately saw an improvement in not only the defense but also the rhythm of our play.

We finally got rid of Joe Cole.

We found the proper role for Jordan Henderson.

Luis was wrong
By JAMIE CARRAGHER

Before you carry on reading
It was said in the aftermath of Sunday’s game against Chelsea
Now I am not for one moment trying to sugar-coat the incident in which Luis bit Branislav Ivanovic. It was wrong on all levels. You simply don’t expect to see a grown man bite another grown man — that is behaviour you would  associate with nursery school.

But the way things are now being pitched is that Liverpool have got to do something about the rotten apple in their midst. 
It is as if Luis is the only player to have represented Liverpool who has ever been embroiled in controversy.
That simply isn’t the case.

We have had it many times before

Souness
It was a serious incident but it is one which fans and some of his old team-mates speak almost nostalgically about.

Robbie Fowler had his scrapes
Jan Molby was sent to jail in October 1988 for three months for a drink-driving offence. 

More recently
Every one of the players I mention regretted what happened and Luis is the same. More importantly

Luis is normally a bubbly lad around the training ground. He tends to mix mainly with the other South Americans in the group but he is well liked all around because he has a fantastic attitude to his job and just loves playing football.

'I'd rather be bitten than have my leg broken'
 
In my time at Liverpool

Yesterday
Luis knows he has done something seriously wrong
But

We have a top psychologist in Steve Peters who comes to the club once a week and he could have as big a role as our manager

Ian Ayre has stated that the club are not looking to sell Luis. History shows that message has always been the same. What happened when Tony Adams was released from jail in February 1991 after serving a sentence for drink- driving?

He went back to captain Arsenal and won eight major  honours. Look at Eric Cantona. 

Less than eight months after returning from his eight-month ban for an assault on Crystal Palace fan Matthew Simmons

As Martin Samuel said in his column yesterday, a precedent at Anfield has already been set.

During the Hillsborough memorial service in 2009, was banished immediately. Plessis, who was viewed as being a player of promise, was admonished but stayed.
Morally you could say such standards are wrong but it happens in any walk of life


People may say this is a  Liverpool-biased opinion but I don’t want to see another world-class player leave the Barclays  Premier League
We are talking about one of the top five players in world football here. 
Finally

The bite was shocking

I know what it is like to have your leg broken by a reckless tackle. Lucas Neill cost me six months of my career in September 2003 when he played for Blackburn. Would I have preferred to have been  bitten? Absolutely. 

I suspect that Branislav Ivanovic, you wonder whether you will play again.

The fact of the matter is, is that we both have rational reasons as to why we believe Suarez is staying or going, and we both have personal agendas on what we hope the outcome to be. Now, we all need to take a good look at each other in the eyes, and agree that no subreddit is better then the other, but rather each is just as bad as the other.

That's partially down to the inexperience of the full-backs

Coates (and Carra, we're not even going to let you try."" Everyone focuses on the passing game, but pressing when we don't have the ball is just as important a means to an end as passing, and that goes for our defenders as much as anyone else. Robinson, Flanagan et al can be forgiven to some extent, but the central defenders *have* to shut attacks down before they get to the box. Granted, plenty of Mansfield's attacks came from set-pieces and the attitude and energy they showed in the second half would have put pressure on many defences, and meant we'd win the ball in our own box and have very few options further up the pitch to send it to.

Coates, but in terms of his aggression from the back, is completely wrong. He's actually more suited to Benitez or Houllier , but that's another conversation; Rodgers needs defenders who'll win the ball further up the pitch, and at the moment he doesn't do that. Hopefully he'll learn, but today did a lot to win me over to Rodgers' side on this one. I don't want us to sell Seb yet because I believe he'll turn into a very good defender, but he'll have to go somewhere where he can improve his reading

1351607611.0,12c7ia,Our hero ,I_eat_footballs,117,15,17,"There’s never been a player quite like Luis Suarez at Liverpool. Well of course

 Quick feet, tuned aggression and a talent for the unexpected have been fused with an irrepressible desire to win football matches that few in the world possess, to make the insatiable Suarez one of the most likeable and gifted footballers of the 21st century.

 At least

 Hand signals, in a typical Goodison Park derby.

 A game like this never looks for pretty passing or technical brilliance, and a talking point.

 Suarez dutifully provided all three.

 For the Liverpool fans, he led the line with furious dedication. Whether dropping deep to trade off passes or latching on to balls over the top, Suarez was magnificent. He tracked back to tackle the ball out for a throw in. He chased lost causes. He was the first to everything that came his way, and once the ball was at his feet, he made sure that magic followed.

 Consistently turning defenders, proving a challenge to stop both on and off the ball.

 He also scored. Somehow only once.

 He first fired upon goal with a fierce volley that deflected in of the unfortunate Leighton Baines

 As for the Everton fans

 It was Moyes, falling humorously to the floor in front of the Everton manager.

 Brendan Rodgers would later call it “Scouse wit, the most potent retort of all, in celebrating his goal, and endeared himself even more to the travelling supporters while incensing the home fans.

 Phil Neville later emphasised Suarez’s point by being booked for diving.

 Meanwhile Marouane Fellaini kicked, who several times did well to stay on his feet after cumbersome challenges, that remained a “cheat.”

 And then there was that goal. The goal that was and the goal that wasn’t.

 Smashing the ball into the roof of the net after a knock-down from Sebastian Coates, in dramatic, late and great fashion.

 For a few seconds anyway. For the linesman had ruled offside

 Even Moyes conceded that Everton were fortunate not to have lost the game in that moment.

 And what of Suarez? Angry

 He smiled.

 As he jogged back into position, as it had time and time again this season.

 It was the same smile that was spread across his face as he performed his diving celebration, thank you!”

 Suarez’s humour didn't end there. When a coin thrown from the stands landed in his proximity

 As the boos, and then his own fans.

 Turning away from the hatred and bile

 For whatever reason, performs well, and scores goals. Opposition fans don’t like him? So be it. The people that matter appreciate and adore him for not only his footballing talent, but his unique and unbeatable desire and determination to win every game he participates in.

 He is often criticized for exhibiting such anger in the face of decisions not going his way, most players would be spitting blood, enraged and inconsolable. It is remarkable that the Uruguayan's temperament is criticized under such ridiculous treatment from opposition players and referees, but it is.

 Because the world needs a villain. The world needs a talking point. And right now

 But to Liverpool fans

 Goals, chance creations, and now comedy celebrations. He has been involved in 80% of Liverpool’s goals this season, and in his 4 derby games, he has been involved in six goals, with three of his own and three assists.

It is great that amongst LFC supporters considering the wage and signon costs of players in a transfer is beginning to catch on. I am seeing the realization awaken in people steadily over time. It is better that we have an informed fan base that understands how the financial side of football works so that we can be realistic about expectations and better judges of club performance and transfers. Transfer fees are a small part of the total cost of a player, so that we can send out constructive feedback to the club rather than ridiculous comments like ""Carroll! we shoulda bought Aguero"".

Here is how the cost of a player is calculated.

You take their weekly wages and multiply it out by the length of the contract

Joe Allen: £40k per week

Andy Carroll: £80k per week

Add on the transfer fee of each player to that total

Joe Allen: £12.4M + £15M = £27.4M

Andy Carroll: £24.3M + £35M = £59.3M

To get your annual cost for each season

Joe Allen: £27.4M / 6 years = £4.56M per year

Andy Carroll: £59.3M / 5.5 years = £10.7M per year

This has no reflection on how money actually moves (eg. transfers may be all upfront, or twice a year etc.) but it is how the clubs reflect player costs on the books so it is all that really matters.

On top of that

The players wages (along with the wages of staff) are a single line item in financial reports. The player cost is a separate line item again, or you have cheap players who are on high wages and tough to get rid of (Bellamy twice) or you pay both a high transfer fee and high wages for worldwide stars.

[This image](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LYovB3vpmFo/T6MoZICMfOI/AAAAAAAAFpY/dJDfjplrLg4/s640/5+Liverpool+Profit.jpg) (via [swissramble](http://swissramble.blogspot.com)) is a summary of our financials for the past 5 seasons

Year | 2006 | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 
:----|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:
**Turnover** (£M) | 119.5 | 133.9 | 159.1 | 177.3 | 184.5 | 183.6
Wages                          | 68.9 | 77.6 | 89.7 | 96.1 | 114.3 | 128.9

**Total player costs** | 94.1 | 108.7 | 122.2 | 133.5 | 154.2 | 165.2


**Edit:** To add a note here, high-risk players on high wages.

I was going to add a line showing our table position for each year


When Liverpool were under H&amp;G we didn't have ready cash reserves and we owed so many clubs money that we were not getting transfer offers accepted on normal club terms (eg. pay it out later, player transfer income, etc. went down on the debt (we found this out later).

This is why offloading that list of players I put [out here before the window started](http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/tvd6j/is_anyone_else_scared_that_we_might_loose_some/c4q5wml?context=3) is a good thing, low transfer fees, was:

* Kuyt
* Alberto
* Maxi
* Wilson (apparently on 40-50k)
* Jones 
* Cole
* Aurelio
* Bellamy

Players on large wages who are ok: Reina, Spearing. And then loaned out: Shelvey and a bunch of young players all on £500-1M p.a. I have no idea what type of wages Downing is on, but Carroll is also not working out considering his wage packet.

With that £35M off the books we can now spend that money in a mixture of transfers and reasonable wages, we would easily have a number of clubs ready to take him since he is so cheap overall. If we gave Sig £70k per week and then he didn't work out, we would just be replacing one Acquillani with another (this is no comment on Sig as a player, just reality).

It is **amazing** that we have managed to offload so many players. Even with the compensation we are paying for Alberto and Bellamy

I really never thought we would achieve so much so soon in the offseason

That said, where the theory is that the entire squad contributes to the success of the team and each first team member is on wages in a band between £45-90k. So you have fringe players at Arsenal taking up 50k per week while no ability to retain top talent like RVP. The Spurs structure is similar, but at a lower scale, their max was £60k per week and they had player like Modric on £40k and Bale on £25k.

The idea wage structure would be new signings on 30-50k per week, so that they can be loaned out for experience cheap. That would mean that the base wage bill is 30 players * £35k per week which is £54M. You then give the large wages to proven first team members: Gerrard, Johnson, Reina (already there) and now Skrtel and Agger - give them each 100-125k to retain them and the wage bill becomes £110M. Add to that staffing and coaches and we are in the reasonable ballpark of sensible wages.

I don't think we should be selling Agger and/or Skrtel in order to get more wage space. We wouldn't be able to replace them. I think part of the new £30-35M in space should go towards rewarding them with new deals

**Edit II:** I hope this also explains why selling Carroll on a 'loan to buy' makes sense and would (in theory - considering if the rumor to West Ham was true) suit both parties. West Ham get to start amortizing his transfer fee next season when they have the Premier League TV income on their books, we would remove his wages of £4M per year and the £2M loan fee can go towards his amortization, which would immediately free up £6M on the books to spend on a new player (again, you can measure this as 1.5 'joe allens' - which is why you can start to see why BR may want to do this deal). Even though it is only £6M now, it means buying a £20M player, plus wages (or two 'joe allens' :))Then at the end of the year we plug the £17M fee in as income, remove the amortization fee and account the difference as a negative in a separate column.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/LiverpoolFC/comments/xtd3z/a_guide_to_calculating_the_real_cost_of_players/

**Who Is He?**

If you ever watched a Reserves game last season, Carroll is 6' 3"" and Seba Coates is 6' 5""!). 

Born in London, before Liverpool rescued him from an unfortunate future. In September 2009, The Reds captured his signature for a fee rising as much as £250,000.

In his first season (2010-11) as a Red

.

.


**What Kind Of Player Is He?**

Ngoo is not your typical English #9. Ngoo is'nt a target man who thrives off floated crosses to his head but rather short passes to his feet. Ngoo possess a wonderful first touch and dribbling skills reminiscent of Peter Crouch. 

However when he first came Ngoo was criticized for being quite wasteful in front of goal. With strong competition from Adam ""The Next Fowler"" Morgan

You'll often see him in games charging at the opponents whilst performing perfect step-overs. Centre-backs just stand in amazement

As a Scouser, and the 96 will never be forgotten.

Too many good people were lost that day, as to what happened 24 years ago.

My dad was there on the day, I've known too.

It's very rare that I see my dad cry, as did everyone at that match, but 96 still had to needlessly die.

Every fan at that match was a hero in my eyes, when all they did was try to help.

And though I may not have been alive then, whether you be red or blue. I'm proud to be the son of a man who tried his best to save his fellow fans.

My dad probably doesn't realise that a massive reason why I look up to him is because of what he's told me about that day. I know he'll probably never tell me everything, was a hero that day.

**Jordan Henderson** - Had great moments and frustrating moments

**Coates** - Will be in the first team in a few years

**Suso** - I can see why people are eager to see him to play

**Assaidi** - Dayum..that boy can feed, attack..need to see more of him but a good game

 Suarez watch: ^because ^fedward ^told ^me ^to


He touched the ball.



He headed the ball and the ball makes love with the woodwork. 

He touched the ball again and passed it back to the midfield. This must be a sign of Suarez's negative feelings about liverpool.


He argued for a handball. HE LOVES US.


He took a free kick and deliberately hit the wall. This must be a sign that he wants to move and make a wall between us and a champions league spot.

YNWA guys .. YNWA..

There is no point in arguing about where the goals will come from or why did we have to let Carroll go

The reason I say this is because the inconsistency we have comes from the longest change in the club I can ever remember. We have had change of owners and change of Managers. LFC is built on greatness and always will be the best club in the world in my eyes. However the fans demand change to be immanent because this is LFC and we should be up there with the best.

Just think of the confidence level for the lads playing today, Suarez and Gerrard week in and week out. 

It has been long and tough three seasons with changes in management and staff and owners. It has been three seasons of sliding down the premier league table. It will get worse

Our team will rise again!!! It is not a wish but a fact! We will come together and we will start winning and we will be pushing for the top of the league again. It is what LFC does and what we help them do as a loyal fans. We will put our heads down and push harder and train harder. We will stand by our players and our manager when no one else will. THEY WILL NEVER WALK ALONE. They are our squad and our legends

I've been to Anfield as a youngster but this is the first time I'd got to see them as an adult. 

Now unfortunately I was sitting with the  Toon fans but at the same time

The first goal I nearly cheered and screamed at until I realised I was surrounded by thousands of hardcore Toon fans. Now at this point I'm thinking

Then came the second, the fifth &amp; finally the sixth. 

By the fifth goal I was slightly cheering and applauding and people started to notice but I couldn't care less. 

The 6th goal came and I screamed. As loud as I could I screamed HENDOO!!! The seats around me were deserted so I let loose.  

The main experience for me was the singing. The Toon fans started with 'LUIS SUAREZ

The best moment though was when the away fans sang 'Justice for the 96'. It was a beautiful moment. Along a bit from the away fans a sign went up from the Newcastle fans saying 'Justice for the 96'. The away fans responded by applauding the thought.

So I was at a toasting session with one of the political groups on campus

""So I'm from Texas, I remember, this neighbor actually bought Liverpool.""  I kind of choke because I'm more than a little surprised, but get back to drinking pretty quickly.  ""Like I said, he's owned a number of teams in the past, and he still owns a bunch now.  But he was really surprised at the seriousness with which the Liverpool fans took the club- like, he started receiving death threats.""  At this point I had to put down the cup because I couldn't contain my laughter.  He goes on.  ""Yeah, he's driving it into the ground

A few months later, so I ask him, ""Hey, [name redacted]!  What's your neighbor's name?  You know, the one you said bought Liverpool.""

He says

So anyway, I hope it's a nice distraction from all this Suarez business.

His loan spell at Bolton was one of the most impressive displays by a young player in the last 5-10 years in the Premier League. (8 goals in 12 games.)

He isn't playing now because Torres, and benching him for a young lad like Sturridge would be crushing to his morale.

If you even look at his characteristics, very direct in his runs and passing, he can finish and he can beat the offside trap time and time again.

That last point will make him absolutely vital to us. The only proven way to deal with Suarez is to close him down quickly, that's what makes him the player we all know and love. Centre halves know this, and push forward to trap Suarez so there's nowhere else to go but backwards. Having a quick player like Sturridge in front of Suarez gives him the option to play the ball into space behind the defensive line. A player as quick as Sturridge can latch onto those balls and put them away. That's the kind of natural, direct, aggressive movement that only a greedy striker can provide, and it's exactly what we need.

Remember this post at the end of this season. If I'm wrong about him, and Sterling, and Suso, and many others.

I've got a really good feeling about this kid. As good as how I felt when we signed Suarez.

However, who showed his age when he made that dreadful backpass against zenit today.. The man has done a lot for our club but he is going to retire and there's nothing that can change that..Sebastian Coates, despite being an established international for Uruguay, is also not trusted enough to even sit on the bench... Youngsters such as Kelly and Wisdom are also not good enough for a starting place yet.. How many times this season have we seen our beloved side waste a 1 or 2 goals lead due to amateurish defensive errors.. 

We've got Suarez and Sturridge who can score bags of goals, cannot be blamed for the many poor passes and lapses in concentration which led to many of the goals we've conceded... What is now missing from a potential champions-league side is a world-class defensive Titan... A mats Hummels, Giorgio chiellini, Dante, thiago silva or Sergio Ramos would lead us right to that elusive fourth-place spot but there is no way they'd even consider leaving their current teams, who are all better than us.. In my opinion, the best option for us would be Angelo ogbonna.. 

Ogbonna is a monster of a defender who is an amazingly clean tackler... Standing at 6'2 and weighing 86 kg, probably around £10-14 million, which would be a steal for someone of his talent.. An added bonus is that his physicality and tackling ability would see him fit seamlessly into the premier league so there wouldn't be much of a transitional period..

**[WILL THIS BE AN EXCITING TRANSFER DAY DEADLINE!??..](http://i.imgur.com/nyanf.gif)**

----------------------------

**Transfer Deadline Day Round up or how to fuck up a guaranteed transfer:**

What If I told you despite all the rumours and the speculation [we didnt sign ANYONE of transfer deadline day?](http://i.imgur.com/6McDy.gif)

Crazy you may say?

Now what if I told you Clint Dempsey

I dont know about you

If things weren't bad enough

It was no secret Liverpool needed a goal scorer so in true LFC fashion we waited too long and then to put in a cheeky bid of only £4 million

and now with Carroll gone

Our goal scoring needs now [rest on Borini](http://i.imgur.com/qWCSl.gif)

I don't know about you

**Honest Note:**

We should hope for the best and Im sure we'll be alright but having a natural Goal scorer who does and can score would have made life for us SO much easier

-----------------------------------------------

**The FINAL Transfer List:**

------------------------------------------------

**Transfers In:**

*Joe Allen* - Proof that Gerrard and Alonso were more than friends

*Borini* - You..you have a LOT of fucking good work to do my son..

*Sahin* - Not yet graced the field in red but has been tipped to be one of the future best players in the world..we'll be the judges of that! [Still though..Sahin](http://i.imgur.com/k815a.gif)

*Assaidi* - What can I say

*Yesil* - please

**Transfers Out:**

*Kuyt* - [In comparison to the other out transfers..](http://i.imgur.com/RRRyq.gif)

*David Amoo* - ['Big loss to the club' - Nobody](http://i.imgur.com/JrtVR.gif)

*Fabiano Aurelio* - Thanks for the memories my man

*Maxi Rodríguez* - all the best my friend

*Alberto Aquilani* - [...You will be missed](http://i.imgur.com/pUZ6q.gif)

*Craig Bellamy* - [knowing that we need him but also knowing he's finally back home with the club he loves](http://i.imgur.com/dkEvC.jpg)

*Andy Carroll* - [in reaction to not signing a single replacement striker for this season...](http://i.imgur.com/rLqqV.jpg)

*Jay Spearing* - [*...and Jay Spearing has today agreed to go to Bolton on loan*](http://i.imgur.com/sez4T.gif)

*Charlie Adam* - Brought us some joy

*Nathan Eccleston* - [Bye I guess?](http://i.imgur.com/aszEa.gif)

---------------------------------------------

---------------------------------------------

**Speculation Fails**

*Gaston Ramirez* - Wanted £18m from us

*Theo Walcott* - *Sigh...*

*Clint 'should be a Liverpool player' Dempsey* - [Signed for Spurs..](http://i.imgur.com/2sakf.jpg)

*Daniel Sturridge* - Stayed at Chelsea

*Christian Tello* -  Stayed at Barca

-------------------------------------------------

**Final Goodbye**

Well

In a Crazy window full of ups and downs

we managed to keep our prized centre backs from leaving

Agger, [did Dagger care?](http://i.imgur.com/LOwum.gif)

Our Midfielder got the biggest influx of players with enough talent

We will all remember that feeling of [watching Raheem Sterling play for the first time](http://i.imgur.com/nxNy5.gif)
