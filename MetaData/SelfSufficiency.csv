Hey there good people of Reddit. This is my project

..

The Solarflower is an open source solar energy collector which tracks the sun automatically through a simple non-electrical mechanism.

It can be made almost anywhere from common recycled and salvaged materials using basic tools and skills, and can produce up to kilowatts of power per device.

Depending on available resources it should take one to three unskilled people less than a week to build

Potential examples of use could include:

~ Electrical production with simple steam turbine/piston

~ Dome oven with integrated water system for temperature regulation and hot/pasteurized water.

~ Steam distillation of water for removal of chemical

~ Medium to large scale food dehydration

~ Conversion of fibrous organic waste into charcoal for energy storage and low smoke cooking

~ And any other application utilizing heat.",self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/10f829/solarflower_an_open_source_scrap_makeable_solar/

I collected the extra long needles that fell off of Ponderosa pine at the arboretum here a while back but finally got around to making my first basket. I used store-bought raffia for the stitching but would like to do it with some gathered natural fibers too. Sinew would be nice but I don't think I have the right lifestyle to be scavenging much of that yet. I used a very basic coil basket technique and learned a lot from doing it.

My brother was an amazing man. He was the older brother that was just better than you at everything. He was a troll before the term was created; when I was very young he was watching college football on TV and I didn't know any of the teams playing so I asked him what league it was. He told me it was the Gay Football league. For the next year or so I believed it. 

Our mother passed away in 1994 when I was 12 and he was 18. My father was not really in the picture since he was working a lot. My bro was really the father figure I looked up to. I had _so_ much respect for him, it was his mindset. I remember some mafia type people coming to our home saying he owed them 20,000 dollars for gambling debts when he was only 16-17. Even then I knew he wasn't right for putting himself in that position, but I certainly respected that amount of balls he had at the time. 

After living in his car and friends couches for a couple years he bought a house on his own at the age of 20. He busted his ass and converted his basement into an apartment and rented it out. He worked so much and finally bought his own deli. By the time he was in his late 20's he ran and partially owned 3 Deli's. During this time I was moving up the ranks in IT

I got into legal trouble around this time and I called him asking for money, no matter how stubborn and motivated I was. I was defeated and proud at the same time. 

Soon after this, it really showed me personally how vicious cancer can be. My brother was phased by all this, especially when she said ""don't let me die"" when she gained consciousness on her death bed. Being the guy he is, he looked everywhere and wanted to fly her to mexico for some strange treatment while he was raising his new born child. She died, and he wasn't the same. 

My brother started taking and abusing pain medication after this that wasn't subscribed to him. He abused it and wasn't the same person anymore. He still managed all the things he needed to do, but he just kept on going. Some people call in sick to work because they have the option, but my brother didn't - it was his life. 

I got into a stupid argument with him some months later and I selfishly told him ""You're dead to me"", and inspiration is dead and those were my last words to him. Today is the one year anniversary of his death and I thank anyone for reading this. It really helps me by typing it all out.  ",,False,self,t5_2r0yw,True,,

1295741014.0,f79uz,I lived in a cave for over 3 straight months. AMA,brickout,86,19,57,"Howdy SelfSufficiency -

I’m new to the self-sufficiency gig

In the fall of 2009 and the spring to early summer 2010, which basically means zero amenities and people are allowed to camp for extended periods of time. I found a sweet spot that was secluded, private, and had plenty of open land surrounding it. Every great once in a while somebody would wander into my camp, usually lost while looking for a nearby hiking trail. At the longest stretch, I went 14 days straight without seeing or interacting with another human being.

Now, and I’m a noob. I packed in nearly everything I needed. This was more of a ‘have an ultra-alone head-space adventure’ than being a modern-day wilderness pioneer. However, I think the experience may pique the interest of some people here.

My cave was pretty modest in dimension, so smoke from my fires generally ventilated pretty well. There is a big ‘shelf’ of stone in the back of the cave, perfect for storing my stuff at waist-height. I could just stand straight up in the middle of the cave and I’m a bit over six feet tall. 

The cave faces due east,000 ft peaks about 25 miles away. The easterly exposure means I was protected from nearly all weather events and caught the first rays of sun in the morning. That was nice, especially on the multiple nights that the temperature dropped to nearly 0 F with snow on the ground. A modest fire was enough to keep the cave warm enough unless the wind was wailing from the east.

Above the cave is a mesa top that is roughly 5 acres. The mesa complex is surrounded by ~50 acres of unimpacted land. Besides a nearby hiking trail

I packed in lots of dry food, corn, quinoa, lentils, couscous, and a few spices. I am a tech nerd, so I couldn’t do completely without my gadgets. I had a portable 26w solar panel and a 54whr battery to recharge all my camp batteries (i.e. for headlamps, mp3 player, drawing, and wondering about my place in this world as well as humanity’s place in the world.

Since then, but it will hurt to see it go.

I want to live in the cave, but for much, much longer and much closer to actually being self-sufficient. I think I’ll have to go somewhere less harsh where I can at least find a source of potable water and some local things to eat. I hope to go armed with a few very basic tools and supplies and with lots of knowledge of local flora and fauna and try to make do as well as I can.

Anyway, or comment away!

**EDIT:** Forgot to mention that I played around with fasting while in the cave. I fasted for a total of 15 days in a 45 day period. I did it in three 5 day fasts. It made shit really weird.

(Long read inside, but help is greatly appreciated!)",obsidian468,67,7,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/o0gjd/planning_an_offgrid_home_with_two_other_friends_i/, I'm looking to build a shining example of self-sufficiency - something I can use to educate others on how to do it better.  The problem is that I've only done internet and library research.  I need insight from those that have actually done it.

Right now, including livestock (likely chickens, pigs, and goats), an orchard including fruit and nut trees, and farmland including various fruits and veggies or all sorts, depending on what grows best at that time of year (strawberries, blackberries definitely included).

Here's my plan (warning

Home:

What sorts of things would you and [the other participant] like to see worked into housing, the lower the cost).  As I mentioned in the reply I just sent you on FB, I realized right after I sent the rough floor plan to you that I had forgotten to add a cold cellar - that's a must for a project like this.  I'd likely put in the rear of the house, about 5-6 feet lower than the rest of the house (to make for a thicker roof and better insulation, not to mention keeping the ambient temperature in the room a little cooler - I'd like it to be around 55 degrees year round, with a large chest or upright freezer).

Also, designed to handle 6 people for daily use, and up to 9 people for weekend/vacation use (meaning that it's more than enough for day to day living, but won't be over-taxed should we entertain several guests every now and then).  It has the added benefit of turning our bodily waste into rich fertilizer for the farm.  In conjunction with a separate composting system for biodegradable garbage, we should be able to produce all of our own fertilizer.

As far as home construction, and the right living quarters.  The primary wall between each section (which will also be structural) will be about 2 feet thick, and filled with a combination of earth, straw, and sawdust - basically scrap building materials, which provides for great efficiency.

I was also wondering if I should leave the design with two completely separate living quarters, and three bedrooms with living space on the other side, and have a larger, shared kitchen.  The reason I originally broke it up into two complete separate living spaces is because of bad experiences with former roommates.  Those experiences are not likely to be true here, as we're all adults with a common goal, and know how to respect each others' things.  Besides, two kitchens will greatly reduce the efficiency of the space

A possible design that could work is to reduce the size of the central great room and put a large kitchen across the rear of it (the bathrooms would have to stay more or less where they are because of the placement of the central composter).  The space gained in the living areas could be turned into storage, or simply eliminated to make the home smaller, and thus more efficient (if we eliminated the separate kitchens, the third bedroom on the right side would be moved into the space for the kitchen; on the left side, the second bedroom would be moved into the kitchen space, and the space vacated by the bedroom would be turned into a shed accessible from outside only).

Infrastructure:

The first part that I worked on planning is power generation.  I'm taking a three-pronged approach to this - solar, average number of sunny days per year, and amount of wind and wind speed on the property above any local obstructions (trees, buildings, water towers, etc.)).

Solar power would likely be one of our primary forms of power generation, and drafty, poorly designed, and using highly inefficient heating/cooling - though I do use CFL lighting throughout) averages about 5KWh/day of power usage.  This 10KWh system should be more than enough to power the entire off-grid home (at about 2500-3500 square feet), even if we used conventional heating and cooling.  This can likely get scaled back.  I priced this system out at about $14,000, not including mounting or batteries.

Wind power would be mostly just a back-up system, with tower, is around $16,000.  This is by far the most inefficient system, considering power produced versus installation costs.  Costs can be greatly reduced if we can reduce the height of the tower.  Over 30', the cost of the tower height roughly doubled for every ten feet.  With a 30' tower, this system could cost as little as $6,000 per 2KWh

Hydroelectric remains the wildcard here.  Instead of pricing out systems, or just a fast moving stream without much height difference, we may well be able to produce a bulk of our electricity from hydroelectric.  Overall, it's fairly cheap, considering installation cost to power output, generally averaging 1-4 cents per watt hour (MUCH cheaper than grid power, which averages around 12-13 cents per watt hour.  I've seen systems that can produce up to 2KWh/day for $2000

Beyond the above three technologies for power generation, and various system monitoring systems and fail-safes.  For instance, you don't want to overcharge the batteries.  One of the common fail-safes for that is a power dump, which uses the extra electricity generated over the safe levels for the batteries to do things like heat water or heat air for the home climate control.  I have not yet priced out the battery bank, but I will likely be looking into Lithium Ion batteries, as they are the most efficient, longest lasting, the bank would need to be about the size of a small car to handle the kind of power we'll be generating.  The space would also need to house the various monitoring systems, where it would be stepped down for home usage.  The breaker box would be located in the house. (Don't worry if you don't understand most of this.  That's why I'm here - to engineer and manage this system.  I'm the one that needs to know it.)

So basically I want to get out and live on my own. With no help from outside just me and nature.
Easy

I am a 30 year old German not in the best shape of my life (as I said I am 30 :-( so go figure....). I understand that I need a lot of time in planing so I gave myself 18 Month. I can draw a Bow and I am skillful with the Knife.

In Europe there is no way of doing this without you having to pay some sort of tax or insurance. My goal is to be completely cut from society and civilization.

I don't want to use any electricity or be dependent on ""modern"" tools that once broken I could not replace.

So the Questions are:


* Where can I live without having to pay for mandatory taxes or insurances

* Where am I allowed to hunt or trap without having to pay fees or apply for licences? If there is no place then where is it the absolute cheapest?

* What things have I in your opinion not thought about

* Since I have German citizenship

* What skills do I need to acquire in your opinion that are totally necessary to master **before** I begin my adventure?
  
* What tools are absolutely needed that are ""modern""? I plan on bringing a couple of Knifes with me as I could not build a good replacement myself. But other than that



As you can guess I am at the very beginning of my planing. So any help is appreciated.

Site was wooded area until 10 years ago when it was cleared for the present structures.  


==========================

With all that out of the way


Outside - Backyard.


I plan to add a rainwater collection system. Not anything super fancy


I have also considered harvesting water in some way that typically would run off the ledge just past the tree line. However



I will be creating an area for gardening outside the back fence that will run the length of the fence, an actual greenhouse structure will be added. 
 


I feel more trees and shrubs should be planted in the backyard and likely some berry bushes of some sort. I will research more prevalent floral additions that thrive in my area. I will be planting bamboo at one corner and will harvest it at various lengths



We have all manner of wildlife that we frequently see, fish (stocked pond) Etc. I have some neighbors that will let me barter for some of their goats and chickens.  
 


I have an order in to our local lumber yard for some cedar and will be building 3 3x3 compost heaps. There is also a large compost drum that has the handle to turn it and it's in good shape.  



There is a play structure (and the bright yellow slide is still visible in the picture) that I plan to remove and free cycle to someone or donate as it won't be useful.  



Outside - Front yard
Addition of more trees


I want it presentable out front but no idea in how to make that happen inside the fencing.  


There is one neighbor nearby


Inside


There is gas


How am I doing so far? I welcome any and all questions

- **Crop rotation** -&gt; planting groups of different plant families together
- **Plant sizes** -&gt; tall plants are to be at the North side of the garden not to shade others
- **Companion planting** -&gt; plants can be grown together to aid each other
- **Timing** -&gt; Different plants grow in different seasons
- **Saving seed** -&gt; different varieties of the same plant can't be grown together due to cross-pollination

Keeping all these things in mind

Here are some questions whose answers would greatly help me

1. When a spring crop, do you plant something from a different plant family for the summer crop? Does that already count as crop rotation? When does the ground need its rest?
2. If I plant seeds that are only heirloom (""proven through the decades...""), how far apart should different types be?
3. In certain types of companion plantings

General advice on all this would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!",self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SelfSufficiency/comments/gxwvu/how_do_you_plan_a_selfsufficient_garden_here_are/

Community One will be a commune with goals including:

a) complete self-sufficiency: the ability to exist independently from all other society by producing all of its requirements (e.g. food);
b) complete 'second-generation' self-sufficiency: the ability to produce all of the goods a new commune would need to form. E.g.

The desire for One and the reasons for these goals stem from my essay on political philosophy

* I am becoming distressed with life in the 'society at large', or corporations. I desire a simpler life in harmony with nature and a few close friends who share a similar desire.
* I believe that all people should have the right to leave a society to go and form their own (see my essay for more information). By creating Community One we will be able to prove to others that this can be done

I would also capture rainwater off the roofs of the barn and house to collect in underground cisterns.

Ideally, or on any city sewage.

I am still working out whether one of us would retain a full or part-time job

I plan on growing and preserving my own food

I would like to be as self-sufficient as possible

So reddit

Any and all help would be greatly appreciated.

* The house should be large enough (a 30' diameter dome

* It should be able to function entirely off-grid through solar panels

* Be able to collect, cleaning, aquaculture, and gardening by xeriscaping the property to divert rainwater through an earth-and-gravel filter into a cistern large enough to sustain the occasional East Texas drought. Drinking water can be pumped inside and purified, and another cistern for solar heating the water will be near the bathroom.

I do not mean to imply that any of us has that kind of cash to shell out casually, please link to or describe such in detail. If they deal with ""amount of land"" issues, again, please describe such in detail.

Where I am, and even those with more modest plans can choose more modest greenhouse models. 

It is also true that there isn't much tree cover here

This is not to say that I don't have concerns. For one

Then there are sunlight concerns... though mine would be on flat land with no shade, it becomes a big joke. 

Will any of the crops that I want to grow thrive in a warm greenhouse throughout the winter? Fresh salad vegetables are one of my wants... tomatoes, lettuce. It's tough to discover whether or not these things are photoperiod sensitive (I believe this is the correct term). If they are to such a degree that warmth isn't enough and they need more light than is possible in the winter, a greenhouse loses 50% of its appeal immediately.

The other things that I might like to try are exotic tropicals. This presents complications immediately, these all require higher temps to thrive. This might mean not just a second greenhouse, but perhaps several, all geared towards different temperatures and humidities. Even I must admit that this is a pretty big checkmark in the ""con"" column. So let's chalk that up as another valid criticism... while financial concerns likely limit you to a single small greenhouse, most desired uses of them would insist on recreating multiple climates.

Humidity control can be important if you're in a drier region as I am. The air around here is bone dry. It was this summer

I think that such a thing would allow me to bump the humidity up high enough that I could keep plants that are more sensitive to such.

Then comes heating. I have to contend with average low temperatures in the low to mid 20s throughout January and into February. Weather almost as harsh in December and March. What's it going to cost to heat one of these? And what are my best options there? 

I don't see anything particularly good here. If I go with electric heat, but not a heat source.

You can do the little geothermal heat pumps that some use for their homes now days, and probably still not keep things warm enough that you don't have to supplement. And any scheme where you burn biomass to keep them warm seems risky and would require you to check up on them once or twice a night.

Again

And here we have several dealbreakers already. We haven't even gotten to the subject of maintenance. Personally, of course, that you can afford it.)

However, such a building could use proper glass. But this simply isn't done in commercial operations. I can't even guess what that would cost, likely the frames I linked to wouldn't be adequate. Quadruple the cost, at least. And add all sorts of problems to the mix, from hailstorms to dumbass seagulls smacking into a pane and cracking it.

We all would like to maintain our own private spaces (just a basic human need), and we want to be able to provide space to host them, particularly since we'll likely be miles and miles away from the closest hotel.

That said, along with a large, comfortable entertaining/leisure space.

The only difference between the two designs is the number of bedrooms per apartment.  I'm including both designs here.

I know the biggest difference between the two designs is a higher cost to build the larger one.  Because of that

I am proud to announce that I have been accepted into a four-month long natural building apprenticeship. I applied based on my vision of bringing an affordable and sustainable solution to a big problem for poor working class folks here in the Rio Grande Valley- by building community and sharing skills, community spaces, gardens,... ahem, well, whatever we want! - in a way that uses our abundancy when reducing/reusing 'waste', respects the Earth
 
This intensive training will be taking place near Asheville, TX.
 
""WHAT IS A WASI APPRENTICESHIP? Kleiwerks International and the Women of the Americas Sustainability Initiative (WASI) are offering WASI Apprenticeships in 15 countries across the Americas. The Apprenticeships are hands-on leadership trainings in ecological design-build practices for women. 8-12 apprentices + two assistants will be selected per country, organize, and advocate for strong and empowered communities through ecological design-build practices with the aim of creating a socially and ecologically resilient world!""
 
The privilege of being able to attend has much to do with this conscious vision as much as is does my being able bodied, as this particular program is run by 2-3 women and for a group of 8-12 women. There also happens to be a special scholarship for low-income mujeres from the 956 and northern Tampaulipas to attend. It was especially hard to decide to accept it because I will have to be away from Paulo Esme for all but two weeks (if all goes as planned) of those four months. I do believe this path has been set before me to improve my skills and our community, because the only thing that seems to be lacking here is that I am not economically privileged. As always, I refuse to let that be a hinderance to achieving one of the many so-called idealistic goals when the path is right before my wings. I painfully made the decision to do something I think will benefit my family and community.
 
The cost of the apprenticeship itself is $5, a fraction of monthly salary. To me, it's 5,000 people pitching in a dollar. It's each of my facebook friends giving me a $10 sponsorship- less than $3 a month to help empower RGV communities! It's every single person that's reading this to pass it along and sincerely ask someone they know to contribute a humble donation of whatever they can. Bring out your corona bottles and ms. piggy banks everyone! I am determined to match the scholarship with community support!
 
I want to offer everyone that offers any kind of support to me my services in any way we imagine together upon my return. Need repairs

Here's a rough explanation of what's in the drawing:

Starting from the top left

Top left: apartment one (likely mine), equipment, and product in need of aging.  This part of the structure is located above and behind the front of the structure - everything is built into a hill.

Bottom left: Apartment 2 (likely first partner's), and a large entertaining space.

In front of the left side homes is a low wall, seating areas, and plants.

Middle: a four car garage, should be weather be bad.

Right: Second (and maybe third) partner's living space, practice space for her music, her boyfriend's hobby, whatever.

In front of second partner's home is another low wall enclosing a groomed front yard, and eating space.

There is a wide driveway that leads to the garage

Both homes also have brick (all recycled) walkways leading to the front doors from the driveways.

One additional outside space is to the left of the structure.  The gray curved piece on the right (labelled ""up"") is a sloped ramp leading to a second floor patio space.

Also, a small patio space will also be installed here.

Some additional notes:

All of the rear walls are curved to provide strength to the overall structure.  This will create some interesting challenges in finishing the interior spaces (particularly when cabinets and shelves are involved).

The outside walls will be built out of a variety of materials

 - Used tires: used tires will be stacked like bricks, they are coated with mud plaster, created from excavated soil.

 - ""Earthbags"": Earthbags are plastic bags filled with a mixture of soil, and gravel (mixes vary depending on climate).  These are also stacked like bricks, and coated with a mud plaster, made from excavated soil.

 - Hay bales: This may actually end up being the preferred solution, treated with a wet filling/adhesive solution, and ultimately coated with, as with the other two, a mud plaster created from excavated earth.

As far as interior finishing, for wooden components, shelves, doors, windows, and other such things, we'll be trying to get as much reclaimed material as possible (such as from barns or homes being torn down).

Windows and concrete may be our largest bills in building this, or even custom), and fresh concrete, while not expensive, can get costly in the quantities we'll need.

That said

***

Not included in the drawing I posted:

 - The power management structure (as this will likely be in the back of the hill that this is constructed in - or perhaps even completely separate.

 - The composting toilets and cold cellar areas (these are all located under the main structures

 - The equipment shed (which I have not designed yet).  It will likely be 25'x25'

The big thing is that you see the basic floor plan. The vehicle sizes in the garage give you a basic idea

It's a huge structure.  I will build it.

http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/cheese/Ginger_Ale_Ag0.htm

I've posted that site myself before, I can't claim this is truly self-sufficient... I do grow ginger, but I hardly have a lemon tree or a field full of sugar beets. So the grocery store has to suffice for now.

(Question: How the hell does one culture their own yeast? The only stuff I can find is for sour dough starter...)

Anyway, I misread the packet of yeast, thinking it was a 1/4 of a teaspoon... it's really 2 and 1/4 teaspoons. So whereas the bottle wasn't supposed to get firm until 24 hours later, it was ready to burst within about 4 hours.

I didn't realize I had used too much yeast until today. Yikes, and poured it.

Tonight, it turns out better.

Of my exotic plants... my banana trees are doing well now that they've had to come outside. New leaves are growing much slower than in summer (where I'd get a new one about every week)

I've managed to get peppercorns to germinate

My pistachios are going moldy in the fridge though

One other thing... for those who try to grow seedlings inside, they don't get very hot, and they're $11 each. Much better than the ones made specifically for seedlings that cost $50 and up.

Best of all? I have a potential source for some bugs I've been wanting to get. These little things called cochineals.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cochineal

All along, the bug will naturally infest them, and gardeners and landscapers consider them a really annoying pest. I've managed to find someone who has this problem and is perhaps willing to ship a lobe off of a cactus with some of the little critters.

Don't go and snitch to the USDA on me though... I was going to go ahead and do things proper. It seems that I'd need a USDA permit that takes 4-6 months to get (complete with site inspection)

1286361067.0,dnii2,What should we be doing about those things which we can't easily grow in our vegetable gardens?,NoMoreNicksLeft,26,8,21,"There are few things that one might purchase at the grocery store that you can't grow for yourself. And this holds true even for many things that aren't on the list of traditional garden vegetables. Planting fruit trees or berry bushes or even putting up some trellises for grapes and kiwis isn't out of the ordinary. Even eggs

There are a few things though that it doesn't seem quite so easy to consider doing for ourselves. And yet they aren't quite all exotic spices that you could learn to live without.

These are things where growing them isn't so much the problem... like anything else, ""how can you make it scale?"" Things like wheat, rice, and animal feeds (hay, corn, and soy). Perhaps other grains as well.

Well, other grains could have a similar magnitude within your diet. 

Wheat flour, is nothing more than the ground-up seed of wheat grass, as I'm sure you're all aware. In times past, the apparatus to grind wheat was cumbersome. In the dark ages of Europe, it consisted of little more than [mortar and pestle](http://www.mvtradings.com/images/RMP55.jpg). Wouldn't have been much fun to be a baker back then. The two cups of flour could take awhile. A few centuries later, you tended to see building-sized contraptions with the proverbial millstone doing the grinding. Some used waterwheels, others would use windmills

Thankfully

http://grainmaker.com/

I've yet to buy one (it's pricey), or if I'd go with another... but with something like this in your arsenal, a large chunk of the problem is taken care of.

But how do we grow enough of it? Let's say that you have a family of 3-5 people, and unique in that it varies from crop to crop. For our purposes though, a bushel of wheat weighs 60 pounds. So, we're looking at needing about 2 bushels per person, more or less.

Record yields vary quite a bit, and in many areas the farmer is willing to forgo this expense and make do with yields that won't ever go past 50 bushels per acre.

Many of you are familiar with the size of an acre, it's probably a about an 1/8th of an acre.

So, this is going to require something on the order of a quarter acre if you manage record non-irrigated yields. There are a few gotchas with this figure though... for such a small size, some decent irrigation may be possible, which should double your potential yield. On the other hand, most of us want to shy away from commercial hybrid seed... we'd like to save some for next year's planting or maybe we don't trust the Monsanto and Bayer Crop Science type of companies.

So, and it's not always that pessimistic, there are some indicators that with wheat commercial hybrids are only giving you a 20% advantage, but there are others sources that make it seem higher.

So

There are many different factors that can affect this, simply because it is more economical there. The midwest sees alot of this, but tending towards the north more. In the US, Nebraska grows quite a bit, as do the Dakotas and Montana. Eastern Oregon and Washington state as well. But it seems even Colorado, Oklahoma, and northern Texas grow some. (And of course Canada grows quite a bit, don't let it discourage you (unless it's Hawaii

Decent soil helps, I've read more than a few stories of the Amish managing record yields for their regions with nothing more than hog manure as fertilizer.

We've talked about how much land you might need, rot, or be eaten by birds and animals. There are some hand-pulled planter devices that will help plant the seed at the right depth, and give you more even dispersal, of course. But come time to harvest, this is still going to be overwhelming. When wheat is harvested by hand, it's necessary to scythe (cut it) with a big heavy blade, you take these bundles of wheat stalks

Sounds involved

If you're no opponent of making things easier, VicinSea). They're still out there, the early ones were built like tanks, and they're often pretty cheap. Depending on how much work you're willing to do to get them into running condition, they could be as cheap as a few hundred dollars, but even one that you could drive home won't set you back more than $2000-3000.

And what can you do with one, but also removes the grain itself from them and separates it from all the stuff you don't want to eat. (This is the origin of the word ""combine"" for the big monstrosities, they *combine* the action of harvesting with that of threshing).

There are many pieces of used, I think something like this is what you'd want:

http://www.flickr.com/photos/hunter1828/501634539/

There are others of course

1276813160.0,cg6ll,I want to start an ecovillage with a couple of twists...,BillBrasky_,25,6,41,"I'm sure the title is corny

I want to start a remote ecovillage in Alaska.  I have lived there for a year and am completely taken in by the beauty of the place.  I spent the entire winter outdoors (not literally) and was very comfortable with the environment.  The only word to describe summer is epic.

Have you seen [Alone in the Wilderness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iYJKd0rkKss)?  That was the original inspiration that struck just as my value system got deep underway into a radical change.   After graduating college and working hard in the ""real world"" for several years I was unceremoniously unplugged from the matrix.  Once you wake up there is no going back to sleep.  Money doesn't grow on trees?  Then why are people spending 30 years of their lives paying for a structure made largely out of trees?  Mortgage, I'll eliminate the middle man.  &lt;/rant&gt;

Part of the issue for me is that I'm an engineer.  I can build all kinds of things and things I can't currently build I can usually look at and just see the pieces come together.  Due to that I look forward to basically recreating the foundations of modern society in a fun steam-punk fashion such that every ounce of effort extended goes into improving or maintaining my quality of life.  

I'm not a luddite

I'm really cutting this short since I don't want to go on and on until I sound like I'm just daydreaming.  I'm having visions, but if that means needing some supplies here and there then so be it.  I don't want to hold hands and sing songs nor do I want to vote on crap.  I want to work together with cool like-minded people.  

Originally I didn't want to have anyone within 50 miles but as time went on my anti-social nature wore off a bit and now I think it would be great to be able to work together on stuff.  Live in a tent camp for a summer building a couple of cabins together.  Each cabin would be ""owned"" by some group member and would be executed in their vision, could be 10 miles down river and still be neighbors) or an actual land trust with satellite parcels?  I don't know.  I don't even know where to find people who are interested in this or if anyone is interested.  I'd love to talk about it more though!


tl;dr: I'm working hard for the next two years as I prepare for a real leap into an off-the-grid lifestyle and looking for cohorts along the way!

It's pretty easy to make if you live in a rural area

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/IoCRq.jpg) is the finished mess.

1: Find a container with a lid that can hold a fair amount of the finished mix.

2: Find a drawstring / porous sack bag and a knitting needle.

3: Locate a field that contains Sheep

4: Go round the field picking up the Sheep muck with a trowel and store it in the bag. Collect any wool you see along the way although there usually isn't much.

5: Now go around the edge of the field near the fence and you should find quite a lot of wool attached to the barbs of the wire where the Sheep have been sheltering or trying to get through

Back at home fill your container with hot water and lay your sack of muck down on the grass. Pierce it all the way through many times with the knitting needle.

Dunk the bag into the water

Leave it for a while - but stir and agitate it once every so often. After a bit you will notice a scum forming on the top.

Once the water looks a bit like gravy you are ready to use it (a few weeks). Be careful mixing it in your watering can

So far, and maybe someone else can find a source for it.

You can also submit sources. That's really kind sketchy at the moment. So far, they need not be ""purchased"", if there's a free source, submit that too). If the plant is available in more than one form (seed and potted plant), it allows you to submit a URL for each.

Some of you have expressed an interest in listing your own seeds for sale or trade or whatever... you're welcome to do so. Put up the URL to your ebay store

The categories themselves are far from perfect at this point. I could use some help with that. The ""Food"" category definitely needs to be thought out carefully... it needs several levels of subcategories or it will become unnavigable. Already, each subcategory could have thousands. 

I would appreciate any suggestions on what those should be.

As you might note, burlap, and even finer cloths. I am even open-minded about its usefulness as a medicine. But we can always add it in later. For now, the ""Recreational substances"" categories should only be used for tobacco or alcohol items. 

I think I've once more broken the comment system, and perhaps even the categories themselves. I've already submitted one item and its source, but the very first comment on this thing is how you should never buy from them (ordered the seed 14 months ago, never shipped them... and Dave's Garden has alot of complaints about them as well). Hell, we should probably even be able to rate them.

I've incorporated many of the earthship concepts into the home (recycled tires

Here's a new rough draft of the home floor plan that includes square footage of both climate-controlled

Several things not shown on this draft are as follows:

* A sloped concrete roof that drains into a series of water cisterns to provide water for several functions of the home and surrounding farm.  Additionally, and any additional solar panels that don't integrate into the structure.

* Can and bottle wall construction - I plan to use this extensively

* Roofing: a sloped concrete roof over several feet of soil.  This will house the solar hot water heater and solar panels that cannot be incorporated into the home design

The design also includes a bathroom relocation/redesign that puts all of the toilets close together

Power source details as well as other details about the project can be found in my previous post

Surely the air that comes out of them is warmer yes but no one seems to ever test and document the inside room temperature.

So far, and quick to put together... but the results are less than tasty.

The first time I tried to make ginger ale. As much of a pain as it was to grate ginger, for wine, I think) smelled nicely enough. But instead of 24-48 hours for the bottle to harden up, it was done in 3.5 hours. (Though, the carbonation was certainly lively.)

My mistake was obvious after the fact... the writing on my yeast packet was a little crinkled

The second time around, I tried to make lemon-lime soda. One of each fruit, no ginger, but otherwise the same recipe... and of course, the correct amount of yeast (which means wasting the rest of the packet).

This time

Well, so I have very little experience there... but it seemed almost as boozy tasting as the first batch. Hardly any carbonation at all, if this were store-bought soda, I would have thought it nearly a week flat.

I did use the correct amount of yeast. So I'm still unsure what went wrong here. It's possible that the bottle didn't seal well (I was using a different one at this point). It's possible that baker's yeast isn't ideal. It may have taken too long to ferment, which at least explains why it took so long to ferment. 

Anyway

It's not exactly self-sufficient

I've also gotten a few vanilla beans. Ouch, keep looking... I almost walked off with the spice bottle that had 1 bean in it for $8.50, but they had another brand hidden that had 3 for $7.25. Too bad I can't get my own vanilla vine to thrive well enough to grow these, eh?

I have some thoughts on the lemon-lime soda thing. Though the juices smell nice enough mixed together, use the lemon and lime oils (purchasable, but you could also press the peels for this, I think). And maybe something else.

And as for cola, from what I've read. Most websites seem to agree that the flavor that we like from Coke is cinnamon plus vanilla. I don't honestly enjoy it enough to bother trying, but I'd certainly enjoy hearing from others who do so.

I hope that I've inspired a few others to try this

Historically rennet was extracted from calf stomachs by killing the calves, stretching it onto racks where moisture is removed, grinding it and then finally mixing it with a salt solution until the rennin is extracted.

Current technology cuts genes from a calf cell and injects it into the genomes of bacteria and yeast. This produces high quality chymosin that is not subject to the volatile market for animal derived rennet. It is estimated that 70% of domestic cheese is produced with bioengineered chymosin. *For a consumer who does not want bioengineered foods

Generally

**How to prepare the Rennet: (From eHow

1. Clean the stomach of the calf as soon after the animal’s death as possible. Do this by using your hands and scrubbing the interior and exterior of the stomach in cold running water and sea salt. Handfuls of salt can be used to scour the entire area prior to adding water

2. Scratch away any particles of food or bile that may be stuck to the inner walls of the stomach. This task is much easier if the calf has not been fed 12 hours prior to slaughter.

3. Tack the stomach on a wooden frame to dry for 24 hours in direct sunlight. This will help to rid the stomach of any bacteria or fungus that will cause health hazards.

4. Remove the stomach from the frame

5. When you are ready to use the rennet, over night if possible, but at least an hour or two.

**Make Mozzarella** [From UC](http://biology.clc.uc.edu/fankhauser/Cheese/Mozzarella_American/Mozzarella_American.html)

I followed this recipe but instead of using the powdered Junket(brand name of commercial rennet) tablet

No luck germinating this

If anyone has any other suggestions for varieties to use for lumber

And then, beautiful wood. For lumber, this usually means the Black Walnut. Which also has an appealing, if hard to open, nut. I've never really seen anything made from it other than gun stocks, myself.

Haven't found a source for this as seed

Finally, it was the most common tree in North America, and the tallest on the east coast. Not quite rivalling Redwoods, but not too shabby either at 60+ meters. Then, a fungal disease not unlike the later Duth Elm Disease wiped almost all of them out. For most of us, if we've ever seen the lumber it is only that salvaged from older buildings.

I'll be trying twice to germinate them again this fall, even if they're not practical to grow for lumber, the nuts will make them worthwhile.

Now, and there are several species of it. Supposedly, it can grow up to 10ft per year, and be harvestable in just seven. Wikipedia seems to think that Elongata is the preferred species, but the few places selling this seem to want to gouge. High prices for cloned stock, only sold as small trees. However, if Tomentosa would work

Paulownia: http://seedrack.com/07.html

Of the exotics

But there are specialty ""woods"" if you can call them that

Balsa... we've all had the 50¢ airplanes as kids. It'd be useful for other things as well, only one has germinated out of about 4. It's a tiny little thing, and it doesn't look like it's doing well. But even if I manage to get it up to a decent size, I doubt I'll put it outside this winter, though maybe next.  We'll see what happens.

Balsa: http://www.seedman.com/tropic.htm

(Note

And then there's cork... the stuff we all know from bottles of wine (for those that haven't switched over to plastic of some sort) is actually the bark of a particular oak tree. Not even sure that counts as wood.

This one is hard to find. Only one place has them

I think my harvest for that coming year was a cup of peas

This year we moved right about the time I would have been preparing, close to 3ft tall, with each new leaf taking a little over a week and getting close to 18"" in length. Supposedly they are a dwarf fruiting variety, but until that happens who can say? I might even manage to have them do a little growth this winter, as I have a big bay window that faces in the right direction.

I also managed to get the last of my peach pits from http://seedman.com (Montclar) to grow. I started those last September I think. Split the pits open, it's not a real root... and this last one, it splits open and roots grow out of it. It's called a false germ. And, now the thing's almost 10"" tall, full of little leaves.

I've got a few avocado trees too

I've got a couple of jute plants growing (what they make burlap out of). A cotton plant out in the front yard that was probably planted too late to go to seed. One of my jojobas did manage to sprout

The rest is all pretty mundane. A few tomato plants I'm going to try to keep alive through the winter

Now that I've got a yard of my own, I have my doubts about how easy it'd be to harvest. Or even the purported 350+ gallons of oil per acre of the stuff... that just seems overwhelmingly optimistic.

But even if I have a ranch someday

My Dad: He grew up in Fargo, my Dad's father died when he was 14 which resulted in my Dad becoming the school bully. He would pick on kids and beat them up just to make his life feel less like shit. He joined the navy where he was dishonorably discharged for calling his superior a “nigger”. He then moved to California where he met my mother and her daughter, Brittnie (who was 3 at the time). They had sex and had me by mistake.

My Mom: My mother was adopted at the age of 4 days old and taken to live with my Grandma Dorothy (who is technically her adopted mother) and my Grandpa Blaine (he owns a gravestone company called “Valley Monument” if you have ever heard of it) in Pasadena

My Brother:Now people tend to say how I only say this because I am the middle child, a new car, and a BMX bike. All I got was a vintage NES, 3 games, socks, shirts and some candy. My dad gives him everything he wants because my brother is EXACTLY like my dad in every way. They are both raging alcoholics, are bullies, etc etc. Anyway

Me: I am a gay atheist . When I was in 3rd grade I had insane migraines that were so painful that I would throw up for hours and scream because it felt like my head was being smashed by a sledge hammer (literally). After going to 9 hospitals and being told there was nothing wrong with me, Mild tourettes, and mild short term memory loss. I was constantly bullied (which is why I sometimes offer advice to parents on reddit on how to help) and had no friends. Sure there were kids I would hang out with, but none of them considered me their friend. I found solice in video games because it was the only thing I could do without being mocked or teased (FF9 made my life amazing). When I was 13 I watched my 1st porno and after realizing I hardly watched the woman I realized that I was gay. I did EVERYTHING I could to conceal it. However, I did not realize that the McAfee subscription expired and the computer got infected with a virus that would pop up with a million gay porn pages. My mom discovered it 1st and confronted me about it and I confessed to her. Later when my Dad found out, he came and screamed at me about how he didn't raise me like “that” and why I am just confused. Ever since then he was neglectful and abusive towards myself and I to this day to not forgive him. High School made my life a living hell. I had one friend who was 4 years younger than myself because no one else would talk to me and even his parents hated me because I was not chinese. I was bullied so much that I would boil to a tipping point then I would lash out (one time I hit a kid with a bar stool and tried to stab another kid with a soldering iron in stained glass class). I was always required to sit in the front so that teachers could keep an eye on me and hear kids making fun of me, but 99.99999% of the time the teachers would ignore it and reporting it only made it worse for me. I eventually ended up hiding in the teachers lounge because my bullies would stalk me (this is happening from 2006-2009 mind you). One day, we became great friends and it was the happiest day of my life.

My Dad's side of the Family: Every last one of them are Protestants. And I mean church EVERY day status where they try to ram how being gay is a sin down my throat every time I see them. My grandmother on my dad's side is a total witch. Sure she makes $700, but she always asks my Dad about it and he tells her I am full of shit (my dad has jabbed me in the throat, slammed my head into the wall and tackled me into dressers numerous times).

My Mom's side of the family:  My grandmother passed away when I was 13 and she was living with a man named Terri (who no one talks to anymore because he isn't related to us and was a total ass hat). My uncles Randy and Blaine Jr. are always fighting (Blaine Jr. throws tomatoes at Randy EVERY chance he gets). Randy is a hard working man who makes a modest living working for my grandfather blaine at valley monument making head stones for cemetaries. My grandfather WILL NOT LOAN MONEY TO ANYONE not even for school or if it would prevent you from being homeless.

The Issue: When my brother failed all of his classes for the semester AGAIN

Vocational Rehab: I was referred to Voc rehab by my school's psychologist and when I was there my dad got defensive and told them how I need to be on medication. They told me in order to advance the process that I would need to go back on medications (this is two weeks after my dad took me off of his insurance plan).

Facebook: I have asked EVERYONE on facebook to see if they knew of anyone is hiring. All I ever hear is either unhelpful or impractical because (I can't drive due to tremors I have) I have to ride the bus.
Craigslist: I have tried applying to over 100 positions on craigslist and it always turns out to be a scam to get your personal information, it's 90% commission based, it's full time, or the bar is SO GOD DAMN HIGH (server positions require at least 2 years of experience 99% of the time).

Jobing.com: Pretty much everything listed on there is a professional job that requires a degree. Usually they require that you own your own car (out of submitting my resume over 200 times and making even more phone calls

So what I am asking of the redditors here is if any of you guys have any ideas on what I should do. I lack resources and money (I have $20 to my name) and I really didn't want to ask you guys but I have nowhere else to turn. Hopefully I am just overlooking something

My vegetable gardening experience boils down to planting zucchini and tomatoes in a topsy turvy planter

I really want my family to be more self-sufficient, a small chicken coop, and a heated green house with grow lights for our long, cold, dark winters.

I also have a 6' x 2' counter in the mud room that gets partial sun that I'd like to try container gardening on... is that enough space for my weekly salad greens?

Here's what I want EVERY WEEK REGARDLESS OF THE SEASON:

- 30-40 baking and sweet potatoes
- 15-20 lbs of baby spinach and all those lettuces found in the packaged ""spring mix"" at the grocery store
- 30-40 tomatoes (or 300-400 cherry tomatoes)
- 15-20 lbs of zucchini
- 15-20 medium/large cucumbers
- 3 dozen eggs

Is this possible? How to I even begin to learn how to set this up properly? We can give our garden and chickens about 10 hours of labor a week

I am taking ownership of ideas tossed around here and several forums so that we can get something accomplished. I'm not asking you to contribute information, ideas for cheap greenhouses and do-able alternative energy sources (biogas, diesel storage, gasoline storage, wind power, solar power).

We need a meals calculator: how much livestock and farmed food

We need a profit calculator: how much of X crop or X eggs need to be produced to make a profit, gross and net values variable based upon custom input information as well as templated.

We need a land calculator: how much of X livestock can be put into X square feet or X acres of land with what method (stacking chicken coops for instance or growing stacked podponics or hydroponic units versus standard planting into soil.) and more.

I want all ideas that would be useful and work on a web (php and html5) and mobile (android and apple embedded devices

Other solutions, cost too much money or are very ugly to deal with (and not mobile).

Here's a general idea so far

Homestead / farming / ranching / garden / land planning and development (and upkeep) estimation (for materials lists,000+ plugins it's possible to do some of it with $3,000's worth of AutoDesk Software but what's out there is either a) useful for one task or b) cheap and contributed to by one person who does it out of the kindness of their heart but has no time and thus completely lacks features and or costs $50 to $200.
There's nothing but high-priced solutions and open source solutions just don't get enough drive behind them to get a great project going.
Here's a few people (including myself in one of the threads) talking about it. The main things needed are a) web app b) mobile app integration (with to do checklist type function) c) spreadsheet-math integrated templating system for various jobs, it's more challenging of a problem than most people will do and thus do without.

Ideas for plugins or features include a botanical database for food crops, trees (for wood resources and fruit harvesting), pest management, tracking egg production in fowl ranching, cheap tracking of tagged livestock (cattle, etc) with a DIY solution, At-Home or On-Site weather station data scraping, hazardous chemicals
Our aim is to create a free piece of software with some pieces of the software being open source to allow modification and development of plugins and to plug-in to existing frameworks such as wikis.
Essentially

We want to be able to design (graphically like a CAD program)
We want to be able to estimate amount of water needed and have cut and paste irrigation and watering methods.

We want to be able to use data that's been imported and publish it so that others can use it too (crop planting information for instructions and CAD, crops OK to plant near one another, pests in a given geographic area, weather in a geographic area, etc).

We want to be able to scrape data from CSV and put it in a database.

I'll also lead by saying that I have no immediate interest to move out on my own

The current plan is essentially to bank as much money as possible while my girlfriend attends school. In a year or so she will graduate

However

My current monthly estimate of expenses is as follows:

Rent - $600 
In the area I live in there are plenty of bachelor/basement/etc apartments in this price range. Some are filthy

Rent could be severely lowered if I could find a (couple of) room mate(s). Three friends of mine live together in a 2-bedroom apartment in my area and they pay $275 a month each not including utilities.

Food - $150-$200
This is something I have absolutely no idea about

Toiletries and other essential supplies - $100
I have absolutely no problem buying my shampoo at the dollar store.

Transportation - $0-$80
I will soon be buying an electric scooter to shuffle me about. This obviously wont work out as well in the winter. I don't own a car

Internet - $40
Internet in Canada is expensive

Phone - $30
I currently pay roughly $60 a month after all the wacky government and administrative costs. If I cancel my data plan and remove all the other pomp and frills with a little bit of haggling I believe I can get my bill down to $30.

Entertainment - Virtually nothing.
I'm a social shut-in with a never-ending torrent queue. I don't go anywhere, television shows and movies are completely free. On occasion I will meet with friends over a few beers and nachos. I'll let that depend on how much spare cash I have.

Bank fees - $15 
I can probably get these lowered.

Grand total = $935-$1050

The fees listed above are what I consider essential. There are obvious extras such as snacks, social events such as birthdays that I can't get around without looking like an ass hole. I haven't factored in health expenses. I am Canadian so I have free health care, and I also have benefits from work which cover roughly 65% of most of the things that OHIP doesn't. Still, I could contract some sort of odd sickness which requires medication that is expensive.

I imagine some bird puking up its guts

The jatropha seed was purchased from http://seedman.com . I recommend them, just promise to fix it as quickly as practical. Do check them out. But the jatropha seed looked old, dried out... and I'm not sure that it is viable. Those looking to do this might be better off purchasing such off of ebay. In the past I had purchased it there, and it didn't look half as bad, and germinated in just a few days. Technically it's illegal to import seed without a permit, and most of the sellers on ebay are from foreign countries. 

I've finally found a source for [guayule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parthenium_argentatum). I won't be disclosing this source, and you can just send me a SASE. This particular line is supposedly more frost-tolerant than typical, suitable my own area (Lubbock, TX). Hopefully it will be easy to grow, and I will be able to offer seed for it on a more continual basis.

If anyone knows anything relevant to making rubber from it

My miscanthus is in the ground, it grew 3 inch leaf shoots in the 2 days I didn't plant it, along with 6 inch white roots out of the rhizome. I haven't seen any digging, and I don't think it'd be very tasty for anything either... so I'm slightly concerned. 

I'm finally in an area where Opuntia cacti will grow well. But I've yet to find a nursery that has any. Still one place left to check though. I suspect that I will have something suitable soon enough... so if anyone could help me locate a source for cochineal insects

Also, and the bugs don't really use any other plant as a host, they're quite specific. I don't believe they're capable of becoming invasive, but that's only speculation. I've tried reading up on it on usda.gov, but it's not very clear to me.

And I still look for lac (insects) as well

Cotton: I'm finally somewhere that I can expect it to grow well. Still researching whether I'm technically allowed to grow it or not... they're kind of pissy about the boll weevil in these parts, and who knows how many acres of pasture. So I'm a little excited about this experiment. 

Anyone know of any sources for machines to process it? I've found http://minimills.net 

Also, but it's not very impressive for $130, and I don't care much for plastic. I really want to stop throwing away things that would make good soil, seems like a waste to send them to a landfill.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscanthus_giganteus

Rather than growing it for ethanol

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anaerobic_digester

The result would be methane, it wouldn't take much there. Heating a home through winter would be a little more difficult though.

For cooking

For heating, this might be up to 200 therms per winter month. (One place claimed 170 therms in January for a Colorado home.)

Now, some averages in some states are down in the 650-800 range). Finding what a reasonable peak load should be is a bit tougher. Figure though that in summer, some hefty AC might be needed (and if it isn't, then you'll just need that much more for heating in winter).

I'm having trouble figuring out how many therms a person would need per day though, either.

Some sources are claiming over 8 tons per acre for miscanthus. But I imagine that summer fresh-cut grass will produce more biogas than will the dried material in winter. And you can't easily produce the methane in summer and store it for winter

Anyone willing to speculate?

It looks like natural gas generators are commonly/commercially available. No need to build your own solution here.

http://www.electricgeneratorsdirect.com/natural_gas.php

However, 30 days in a typical month means that even at 50% this is 17,000 kilowatt-hours. Enough for over a dozen homes. A dozen not-so-energy-efficient homes, at that.

 Luckily, with plans to extend it to the rest of the foundation at a later point in time. The foundation is quite old, maybe somewhere around 70 to 80 years, and the concrete is not in optimum condition, but I don't have an extremely disposable income and putting a greenhouse on this foundation would be most cost effective for me, as well as convenient. The foundation is south-facing and receives light from 7am all the way until dusk. Here are some photos of it:

http://imgur.com/a/Q1Set/all

As you can see I still have a lot of clearing and cutting to do

 Basically all I am looking for is advice. Looking online at greenhouse supply stores is mind-boggling and I don't know where to start. Is there anyone out there that could give me some help on starting this project? I'd be looking for information along the lines of what website to buy my materials off of, but overall I am still a novice. Southeastern PA usually has mild winters, so I was planning on using a thermal mass heater for my greenhouse that I could use for the colder winter nights, and possibly rain barrels for water collection. I do, however, have a water line that conveniently already runs to the base of this structure.

* Where would you recommend buying seeds?  Perhaps a bulk-pack of seeds of various types?
* What low-maintenance food-plants would be ideal to grow “wild” in the Michigan climate?
* Recommend a decent quality cross bow for hunting small and medium-sized animals (like geese &amp; squirrels).  Are there any preferred brands,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,,t3_gt2aj

My main focus would be on self sufficiency. Firstly with power and water and gradually growing more and more food until total independence, and maybe even hydro power from a river or stream if we're lucky. I've also read that [off grid systems can receive feed-in tariffs](http://midsummerenergy.co.uk/solar-panel-information/GridConnection/OffGrid) for what power they use even when not selling power.

For buildings, huts, caravans, greenhouses, gardens. I just wonder how planning permission works, and what is allowed, and whether the type of land matters as some sites are advertised as farmland or pastures. Particularly wind turbines on a long mast might be too high?

Finally, or could each person pay monthly into a shared fund for upkeep or something? I suppose there's lots of ways of doing it, I just wondered what people thought. And I guess I'm veering off topic here :P

I had hoped that I might be able to make alot of charcoal for terra preta with it, I don't see how any of these will be practical. I'll of course continue (and maybe expand) the experiment for the next few years, but I don't think I'll pin any hopes on it.

Jatropha... as much as I like http://seedman.com , it's inevitable... and they have all kinds of things you can't find anywhere else). I've bought two packages off of ebay, and both seem to be germinating. I've got one plant that's 4"" tall now.

These I hope to see how practical it would be to make biodiesel from. As noted in the past, and there were a few days where the temp was below 20°F. 

A secondary use, the bug that they used to make lacquer from and still make shellac from. No idea where I'll even get this though... or how I'd import it. The USDA permit process takes 6 months or more, and you can't apply for a permit until you've identified the source. Nor are they very helpful in answering questions. If anyone knows where I could get this, it would be appreciated.

Anyway

I'll post pictures of these later if requested

I think I've managed to germinate the guayule seeds I had acquired. Just a few so far, these things seem to like Arizona better... but according to the source I got them from, this strain will tolerate frosts better than others. I've yet to discover any method for someone like me to process it. For those who are unaware, this plant is the only other one used to make any signficant amount of rubber (the first and foremost being the Brazilian rubber tree, Hevea brasilliensis). Seems people who have an allergic reaction to the typical kind can tolerate this better. So, if anyone knows of some old college chemistry textbook that has a recipe for vulcanization, or can point out what kind of equipment is used to grind this plant up and extract latex from it... please do so.

My mulberry trees are starting to look good

My modest little row of cotton: hardly any have come up

My modest row of jute: not a single germination. Most likely planted too early (it is a tropical thing

1375892911.0,1jw43t,R/Selfsufficiency I'd like to share a big project with you. [self-post],elevatedmovemENT,2,3,0,"Hey everyone.  I'm fortunate to be a part of a team that has been asked to produce and promote a Kickstarter video for Earthship Biotecture.  

The project is to build a 100% Self-sufficient community center in Malawi, medical center, food storage, and bank.  During this project we will be working with the people there and teaching them how to duplicate this structure so we can empower the community there to the path of self-sufficiency, reducing their need for outside intervention.  

I'm not asking for you to donate, and help us spread it amongst your circles of friends and peers.  I know that if we get this project in front of the right set of eyes it will take off.  Will you help us in spreading awareness of our project? A Facebook post, blog post, tweet, or email could be the link we need to reaching the right people.

If any of you have any questions about this project I will be available to answer them here.  Thank you for your time and I hope you find this project as amazing as I do!

I'm still looking for a source for the lac bug

My miscanthus isn't doing so good... out of 8 rhizomes, or they're just sissy plants. So far I'm not impressed.

Now, but I have no idea how well those can do. About the only fiber I won't be trying this year is silk and wool... those take a little more preparation.

My name is Ashley, and myself are going through what I can only describe as hell. To clarify, I'll start from the beginning. During the end of last year we made a decision to leave the economic system and dedicate ourselves to working the land, learning skills that would enable us to sustain ourselves independent of the major consumerist society,  and perhaps building and/or finding a community of like vision along the way.  Along the way, we discovered that there is a network of intentional communities, sustainable communities etc. We thought this would be the perfect answer to the problem of finding land in a market that is set up to eat consumers alive. So, getting an idea of ideal locations, and set out to discover what we could find there. We found a few communties and made all the arrangements, and set out on the road on Christmas day.

Along the way, most of them changed or didn't work out, which, as very fluid people, we dealt with as situations arose, without much stress or fretting. We happen to be extremely easy going and face any situation with a sense of trust that the Universe has plans that we agree have a much larger purpose.  Having gotten so low on money, my father in Atlanta, which was enough to help us continue on to Tampa, plus it gave us a chance to get some travel in.  Tampa was a lovely experience for the most part

Spending time with my sister was great, one after another without any empathy or seeking to understand our point of view. Everyone, even at this point, has been willing to point fingers at us, saying we must abide by their rules – dogmatic and antiquated as they are – or die, get mugged, get raped, but with the community we were trying to stay with at the time. We had to jump between places for no other reason than peoples' plans. If it were a trust issue we wouldn't have been allowed in the house. We wouldn't have been allowed to stay while they were sleeping. Yet, intelligent

It seems that people dislike us and don't want to work with us simply because there's nothing wrong with us. We merely want to live a sustainable lifestyle outside of the economy – the same as these people – supposedly. 

From my Sister's house we decide it is best to use whatever money we have to get away from the situation. We catch the Greyhound to Ft Lauderdale. There we wait for half a day to find some way to get to the airport. There we stay for two and a half days waiting for our flight. We barely manage to get on due to some fine print baggage rules. Andrea ended up having to beg everyone to help and finally her uncle does. He pays for our bags then promptly turns off our only means of communication once we're in a strange land. We still do not know why suddenly this was decided by him
Then we arrived in San Juan, Margo, was just rude, uncaring, and unreasonable about our entire experience. Even though she made promises to us. We were the ones stranded and she said that this was an inconvenience to her. The second, S. Davis, decided we were not worth picking up from the airport, church

They fucked us completely.

So, attractive lesbian women. Outside of an airport with our baggage. You can imagine the time we had and how we felt, perhaps. We find one person willing to come get us. He does, easily. Now we're here about to get kicked out again after we've given this family of three : a man named Don, mother Ana, and a young girl (8), all of the solutions to their problems. That's no lie. We literally, have given them solutions to all of their problems which for some reason they refuse to accept under false pretenses. 

They knew we had no money. They knew we were houseless. They knew we wanted to live sustainably. They knew we were gay and young. 

It almost seems like everyone is trying to attack us simply because there's nothing mentally wrong with either of us. We just want to be away from the system that has literally destroyed everything we once had.

They're only “excuse”, so much to do, they simply need young minds and bodies to help them get it done. Money is not an issue. We've talked with them about selling their products, as well as our own, over the net. We've also talked with them about getting jobs. We have expended all our rational thoughts towards these people only to practically get an “Uh” in return. 

With all that being explained it needn't be said we are sick of people putting our lives in danger over nonsense. And not regular nonsense

Now we are looking for yet another place to stay in which we can implement such things. We are telling you our story,,False,self,t5_2r0yw,False,,True
