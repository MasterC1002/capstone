They take their seats and wait for the circus to commence (which nearly kills not so little Sam as he inches his hand ever closer to hers without making it obvious). Finally he touches his pinky finger to her pinky just as the lights go down and the circus starts

The usual signs… Phone rings but if I answer

My wife has been going out with the girls a lot recently although when I ask their names she always says



I always stay awake to look out for her taxi coming home



I once picked her cell phone up just to see what time it was and she went berserk and screamed that I should never touch her phone again and why was I checking up on her.



Anyway



I decided I was going to park my motorcycle next to the garage and then hide behind it so I could get a good view of the whole street when she came home. It was at that moment



Is this something I can fix myself or should I take it back to the dealer?

There once was a bright kingdom, who all of the Knights wished to marry. When she came of age, many Knights asked for her hand. The King, being a great King, allowed her to choose her own suitor. But one by one, all of the knights were turned down.

One day a young

""Halt

""It is I,"" said the squire.

""And what is the message?"" one asked.

""The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the Princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" both guards gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

So the guards let him pass. The drawbridge was lowered

""Who goes there?"" asked the Herald.

""It is I

""And it is?"" asked the Herald.

""""The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the herald gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

So the Herald opened the door and blared his trumpet.

""Announcing the King's squire

The squire scurried into the room and kneeled before the great King.

""Speak!"" bellowed the King.

""It is I,"" said the squire.

""Get on with it already

""My liege. The Black Black Knight is on his way to the castle to ask for the princess' hand in marriage!"" exclaimed the squire.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the King gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed.

Just then there was a ruckus at the drawbridge. Faintly

Distantly

Through the door the King heard the Herald.

""Halt! What business have you with the King?""

""It is I

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" gasped the Herald.

""Yes, ""Now get out of my way before I kill you.""

The door was kicked open and a seven-foot tall man clad in armour blacker than the moonless night sky strode before the great King. He didn't bother kneeling.

""Insolence!"" cried the King

""It is I

""No

""Yes, ""now let me see your daughter before I kill you.""

""Fine

So the Black Black Knight headed for the tower. He climbed and climbed and climbed and climbed. And then he climbed some more. Finally, moving portrait. 

""State your business with the Princess

""It is I,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the portrait gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now move before I kill you.""

""Fine

As he stepped through, screeched and backed against the wall.

""Who are you

""It is I,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" she gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now

""Well, and brave and able to protect me from anything. And I need proof. Go to the Red Mountain of the South, defeat the ruby red dragon and bring me back a ruby red dragon scale.""

""Fine

So the Black Black Knight trudged down the stairs, down, down. And then he went down some more. He finally came to the throne room, then to the drawbridge, and then finally he was out of the castle. He rode for days and days and days until he was at the base of the Red Mountain of the South.

He looked around for days, and from fissures in the walls.

""Sssssstop, ""who are you to disssturb my sssslumber?""

""It is I, and bring a ruby red scale to the Princess, in order to earn hand in marriage,"" he said.

""Not the Black Black Knight!"" the dragon gasped.

""Yes! The Black Black Knight!"" he confirmed. ""Now face me with honour and I will kill you quickly.""

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for a whole day. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the ruby red dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's neck. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom

He was stopped at the drawbridge by two guards.

""Halt

He stepped inside and the Princess turned to see him.

There was a terrifying battle. It lasted for two whole days. Finally the Black Black Knight stood over the sapphire blue dragon's corpse and used his sword to pry the scale from the dragon's chest. He tied it to his horse and set out once more for the kingdom

The next crucial step is to monitor the traps from a safe distance, caution should be taken not to allow enough time to pass that the bear either starves or gnaws its leg off in order to escape.  It would be prudent to shoot the animal with a tranquilizer potent enough to render it safely unconscious without risking a fatal overdose.  

It is crucial to keep in mind that the polar bear is an apex predator

Finally, you may be breaking the law by attempting to trap or kill such an animal.  Violations of this law could result in steep penalties for the person in question, and trapping of polar bears should therefore be avoided entirely, for legal reasons if not ethical ones.

1339929950.0,v6b5t,The Blue Joke,ThatCricketGuy,95,21,6,"A man was driving along a deserted country road

The blue house is surrounded by blue trees, the man failed to notice the bend coming up and crashed off the road, into a ditch. 

Seeing as apart from this house, up the blue driveway and knocks on the blue door. 

An elderly lady, ""Hello.."" she said.

""Hi madam

""Oh

The man walked through the blue door, and picks up the blue phone. Not wanting to offend the kind lady, he does not question the obsession with blue. While on the phone to the towing company, he discovers that a tow truck cannot be sent until the following morning. He relays this news to the lady, and she offers him a room to stay in overnight.

The man walked up the blue stairs, and drifts off to sleep looking at the blue ceiling.

A few minutes later, and, despite noticing the turn, cannot control his car and careers off into the same ditch. He walks up to the blue house, speaks to the lady dressed in blue and calls the same towing company with the same blue phone. He is given the same news as the previous man, and is offered a room by the old lady.

He walks into his blue bedroom

Meanwhile, noting the two cars in a ditch, drives far more carefully. However, he is incredibly fatigued and has a microsleep at the wheel, causing his car to run off the road into a tree, and down an embankment. He is fine, as is the car, and notices the big blue house. After deep consideration to ascertain whether he had suffered a mild brain injury or not (despite the low speed and glancing impact of the crash)

He uses the blue knocker, opens the door. 

""Can I guess"" she begins ""you've crashed your car and need to call the repairman?""

The man says yes, into the blue kitchen with a blue phone, blue MixMaster and blue microwave oven. 

""He won't be here until morning, their frustration doesn't outweigh your peace of mind.""

He calls the towing company, and enters the third blue spare room. He collapses on the blue bed, staring up at the blue ceiling, and, fatigued from his drive, promptly falls asleep.

In the morning, and the old lady - wearing a different blue dress, blue shoes and blue earrings, pulls out some blue bowls and places them on the table. She asks the men what they would like for breakfast, as the towing company pulls the three cars back on to the road.

I still remember that day, i doubt i'd remember every subtle contour of the painting that I glanced at, in that bustling cafe. The dull minty tingle of the tea i drank while sitting there at 8:04. The sweet aroma that filled the cafe that morning could have been just another detail, but somehow i remember it so vividly, so vividly that every morning it's that subtle smell that starts me from the darkness of my slumber to the darkness of my cell. Somedays I wake up wondering if i had this coming. Most days I wake up knowing I did.
I suppose identity is more than just power. Power can be assumed, something timeless. I've fought mine for so long now that I can't remember the last time I looked in a mirror and recognised the face staring me back, dead in the eyes. Windows to my soul? Hardly. Placards of my identity? Thats an altogether more terrifying idea. These eighty-eight days could be the final stretch of that battle. For all I know this is only the beginning.
Eighty-eight days I've been trapped here
I sealed my fate, my world was a brighter place. The lights are off now in my cell, and yet now, things are brighter than ever. ""Once I was blind, but now I see."" The truth is apparent, and I cling to that final triumph. Sanity slips away. Lights fade away. But Eighty-eight days later, I see what I've been missing. My cell walls fade away, and all is clear. I see all. I know all. All is clear. Eighty-eight days ago
Eighty-eight days ago
I am a pair of nikes. All is still. Eighty eight days later, wars break out, and the world breaks down. I am a pair of nikes.

The son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. However

Finally, I have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing I would really like. I would love to have a pink ping pong ball.' 

The father was rather astonished at this wish, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.' 

And so

The boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. The father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong ball

The next year

`Father, but there is one thing I would really, really like. I would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was more surprised than the year before, `If it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.' 

And so

The boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, but decided not to say anything. The pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again. 

The next year

`Father, but one thing would make my happiness complete. I would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father was beyond surprise

`A carton of pink ping pong balls

`I can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.' 

And so

The boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. The next day

`Dear son, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?' 

The son, dear father.' 

The carton of pink ping pong balls

The next year, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. So, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday. 

`Dearest father, but there is one craving in me. I would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.' 

One of these years, he decided to humour his son's wish. At least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory. 

The next day

The following morning, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. No pink ping pong balls were left. 

The following year

`Father

It was possible

The next day, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there. 

`Father

That night

The next morning

A few days before his 20th birthday

His father visited the young man in hospital. `My dear son! Can I bring you anything to make you feel better?' 

Weakly, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.' 

The father held his son's hand tightly. `Whatever you wish my son

`Very well

The father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. The son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk. 

`Son

The son nodded weakly. 

The next day

`Now, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested. 

The son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter. 

`I-' the son started and sat up a bit

`I- I-'
