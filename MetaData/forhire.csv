EDIT4: Still got some unanswered PM's. I noticed a lot of similar issues in a lot of resumes I got

#1- Proper format calls for work-experience to be at the top of the resume. Why? Because we're cross checking the requirements of the position to your qualifications. We want to know HOW/WHERE you've utilized the skills you claim you have in an office/work setting. Listing off skills is easy. Giving examples of where and how you used those skills is more useful. 

#2- Layout. 
DATE-------Organization Name-----Location [next line]
(Position) [next line]
-Duty
-Duty
-Duty

#3: Skill summaries/ Personal summaries: These are mostly out of date. You don't need to include them in your resume. First, if you feel that it is necessary, by all means leave it, no harm done - it's not a red flag or anything...

#4. Consistency. Lots of redditors resumes have job positions in multiple industries, and you wrote ""Staff Assistant."" But now you're applying for a Marketing Coordinator position, you need to change it up. For ""Staff Assistant,"" you write, ""Marketing Staff Assistant."" Why? Because the word ""Marketing"" matters if you're applying to a Marketing job! 

Same thing for random, and now you're applying to an office job? Guess what you're now a ""Customer Service Representative."" It's not lying. You dealt with customers. You represented their interests...you serviced them. Done. That's the game.

#5: A lot of graphic designers out there looking for work. I keep referring to www.elance.com. great place to make a portfolio or market your portfolio.

#6: Organizations Category. If you've volunteers anywhere, a sorority...this is the category that those things go under. Regardless if you did IT work for them, were a leader, or managed a group of 30 people. This is the place for NON-PAYING positions to go. 

#7. Dates. Write your dates! I can't begin to tell you how important this is. Write your dates so that we know when you worked, abbreviate to Jan., Feb., etc. 

I'm still getting around to more PM's and answering on here so that I can clear up any general questions you might have.  Thank you for your patience.

Here is my original post:
[r/forhire post](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/n5jzx/for_hire_software_developer_5_years_of_experience/)

The response I got was completely unexpected. I was contacted by some very nice companies, with [Jobspring Partners](http://www.jobspringpartners.com/) in New York. How did that work out for me? Well, I am typing this from a hotel in New York, 1300 miles from my home in Louisiana, looking for an apartment to rent before I start work here in 2 weeks!

Adam and Cole did a great job matching me with companies looking for my skills and working with me being halfway across the country. I ended up getting hired by the company at the top of my list.

Thanks to reddit, and Cole I am now pursuing a dream, moving to a new city, and getting ready to continue my career at a great company. If you are hesitant to post here, don't be.

Almost all the messages I received were serious, but he's still cheaper than my last team, because he is extremely fast - and he even takes time to clean up old code and make it easier to maintain.

Long story short

5 weeks later... here we are. InfraggableKrunk has ONLY managed to send me 3 logo samples (the quality of work... a 6th grader could have done that for me within 20-30 mins on photoshop)... He submitted those 3 logo samples roughly 3-4 weeks ago... He has since ignored all email communication and phone calls.

It's disappointing to come across these scammers on reddit but what can you do.

I would really appreciate it if everyone who reads this can upvote it for exposure. I am already aware that I am most likely not going to see my money again but I want to make sure that InfraggableKrunk does not get a chance to SCAM anyone else on here.


**Update 1** - My apologies for the delayed reply. I just got home from work. Thank you to everyone for the support and advice. We tried calling him again today hoping that the post here would have made some difference but he is still ignoring all communication.

By popular demand -- [http://i.imgur.com/kNSol.png](http://i.imgur.com/kNSol.png)... that is the work he submitted to us (3 logo concepts). He was hired to do the logo

I also want to thank everyone who replied by pm offering to help finish the designs. I am going to try and get back to everyone of you by tonight.

**Update 2** - I am also attaching the invoice so that it clears up what all he was hired for in the first place. His info has been blacked out to abide by the reddit rules -- [http://i.imgur.com/QGnpv.png](http://i.imgur.com/QGnpv.png)

**Update 3 - Oct. 19** - Thank you to everyone for the support on here... I am updating this post to let everyone know that the designer has since contacted us and submitted a first draft.

I have worked with 3 web designers in my life, by far, my absolute favorite and I will always recommend him to anyone.

* Computer Programming / IT (current internship is Android app programming) [github page](http://www.github.com/rdavison)
* Classical Music Performance / Instruction (Bassoon
* Speak English (fluently)
* Web Design and Editing

I don't know what to do anymore.  I'm an American currently living and studying in China, and is taking an extra year to continue her studies on her own.

The past two months I've been living as frugally as is possible, a burgular broke into the very bedroom we were sleeping in and both of our absolute most valuable material things. From her: an ipad, a laptop (with extremely sensitive documents), and an electric dictionary.  The burgular also took my laptop (also quite sensitive documents), my iphone, and all of the money in our wallets combined (about $115). Both of our bank accounts are totally empty right now.  She is absolutely devasted and is even toying with the idea break up, but nothing decided yet.  I'm soooo worried :(

With my current job, so I'm looking for some extra work.  If you need ANYTHING done, make/edit a website, make/edit an app, teach child music, teach child language, translation, please let me know and I'll do my best to do it for some extra cash.  Please

Ps. I'm in Beijing

Basically, and for about 15 to 30 minutes per person. Many of our customers are very new to English or have intermediate skill, but don't have any opportunities to practice. We're looking for people who are very patient, and who like meeting new people. Also, many of our customers tend to be somewhat insecure or shy when speaking in English, so we are looking for people who can make them feel comfortable speaking. We'll provide some basic materials for you, like some of the most common words in English language, this could be a very unusual and entertaining job. As far as pay is concerned

1334252173.0,s6h1j,[ForHire] Warning! I got scammed from someone I found on ForHire,caribbeanmeat,108,12,59,"Unfortunately

Summary:
Posted an ad for help updating my ecommerce site. Got a lot of responses. Went with this fellow from Texas. Sent him $300 to make sure he knew I wasn't going to stiff him. Flash forward 2 months, and I have nothing. 

I was more than patient with this person and spent a lot of time outlining EVERY aspect of the site. (I hate when people give you no guidance in a project).

He either doesn't really have the capabilities to do the site or just wanted to take the $300

I asked him for some of the money back (thinking that he did spend some time on the project) but he won't give back anything. And he won't finish the site. So

So, I have a feeling there might be scumbags on here. I'm out $300 because I entered into an business agreement honestly and wanted to make sure someone was confident they wouldn't get stiff. So I got stiffed. 

Specifically. This guy's name [Deleted by OP]

He is associated with this site:
http://adstounding.c_m/

Edit: I want to thank everyone for their help/advice and kind words. A few Redditors even offered to help finish the site to show that not everyone is a dick. That's really cool.

I was able to find someone via ForHire that did the site exactly as discussed and did a great job in about 3 days. Unbelievable guy. So

I basically wanted this to serve as a kind of 'warning' to those people looking for help with a project. I think because this is Reddit we all think that everyone here is like-minded/honest. But just wanted to warn everyone to be careful out there and do your due diligence. 

Edit: Okay, however, think that if you are operating immorally in a business situation than you should expect that others spread the word. Regardless, it is down.

Edit: On a **POSITIVE NOTE** and since someone mentioned

I believe that posting outright the amount that I am willing/capable to pay is the most effective method to get applicants that are actually relevant to me, time, or whatever it is that makes you mad by my posts.

Every time I've posted something with low pay I've got so much hate mail from this subreddit but I always take it on the light side

I think you guys should consider the following facts:

A) Not everyone in this subreddit are US Americans

B) Not everyone in this subreddit makes a $80k per year doing whatever it is that they are doing

C) Not everyone in this subreddit can make even a third of that in a year

D) As a result of A, there are those in this subreddit who consider a $20k a year job to be something worth while

That being said, not being able to find ANY job, and yet when offered a job with a lower pay reddit seems to consider that blasphemy.

People are sitting for months on end trying to land a job, and yet in this subreddit, some jobs are just considered not worth the effort, and some redditors deem these jobs unworthy not just for themselves (which is perfectly acceptable) but for the entire community by downvoting the posts, even if they are 100% legit.

Why does this subreddit behaves like that? Why are some job propositions are considered ok while others are not? Are you so morally and monetary objective that you can deem other posts and people irrelevant? Are you so full of yourself that you post up the minimum wage of the US as to show me what a dick I am that I'm willing to pay only what I am able to pay?

You are not only offending people like me, but you are causing the people who look for jobs like the ones I publish to find this subreddit irrelevant, because my kind of posts are dowvoted despite [these kind of talks](http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/szcjz/revenge_of_the_downvote_tldr_only_downvote_scams/) we had before.

I've been part of this subreddit almost from the day it was established, replying and contributing to others posting and saying constructive things when I can, but yet my posts are not welcome here.

To the mods: I feel like you are cohering that kind of behavior among the users of this subreddit by not deleting/warning offensive and/or irrelevant comments. Could you please also be a part of this discussions so that some of us get a clear view of what this subreddit suppose to be?

If this subreddit is US centric, please let me know, I will try to find a *global* forhire subreddit where these kind of posts are acceptable.",,False,,t5_2qzbh,,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/t6yzq/ok_guys_and_girls_we_need_to_talk/

I've had jobs since then but they've always been menial (Starbucks and various restaurants and retail work) but never jobs or a career that were going to get me anywhere short of a place to live. 

Job searching as a felon is a soul-sucking, a contractor for Google, just to name a few) only to be turned down because the next guy isn't a liability on paper. It truly is incredibly depressing to feel in my heart I'm meant for more than has been afforded me. I've made mistakes and they don't define how I view myself. After years of ramming my head against the brick wall that is job searching, last year I made the decision to go back to school. All I feel I can do is overshadow my past transgression in the form of self improvement and education, so that's what I'm doing. 

A few weeks ago, with NO terrible feeling coming out of the interview thinking ""I'm perfect for this job, they practically told me so; yet it's not happening, I'm banned from society."" and I am proven right. They never tell you it's because of your record, they legally *can't.* I'm told something like, ""We decided to go with another candidate,"" or something of that matter. Just thinking about it hurts. 

So I'm looking for basically any job that can be taught on-site, very personable, always on time, organized and give my best at everything I do because I take pride in my work. I understand how fortunate I am to have a job when I do, most felons are in fact. 

So there it is! All on the table, I thank you. If there's one thing I can leave you with it's that if there's one principle you live by, be it one of humility and non-judgment of others. Thank you!

1370740544.0,1fygxl,[INFO] How to protect yourself in a contract work situation (as a contractor or a client),herduckyness,86,12,14,"In the time I've been around this sub

Most of these cases involve similar themes-- non-communication from the other party after money or completed work changes hands.

While people can and do post testimonials in this subreddit, because a compiled list of people with ""black marks"" against them would be difficult to verify in the first place and could easily be manipulated.  The real onus should always on the parties involved in a contract-work situation to verify the reputation of the other person involved.

To that end

**For Everyone**

* Get as much contact information as possible. Just a reddit handle is not enough. Get email addresses, skype ID, website url, etc.  This contact information will be vital if the other person ghosts on you.
* TALK to the person before beginning work. Sometimes I even break this rule if it's a rush job or a very simple one
* Verify their reputation (if possible). You wouldn't trust an essentially anonymous person you know nothing about to perform work in your home, references, contact information, business they work for, etc.
* Communicate. Before, or at least once every other day. Don't give the other person a chance to forget about the project or fall off the radar. Agree with the person up front about a communication schedule, and stick to it.  
*  Use PayPal or some other payment system with dispute resolution. Cash
* Get a contract. It doesn't matter if your job is a piddly 1-hour task. Have a contract anyway. Make sure to be specific

**Who**: Who are the parties involved in the contract?  
**Where**: Where will the work be performed (for example
**Plan**:  What is the objective of the work? Is it to develop new branding via a logo? Is it to redesign a website? Is it to copy and paste 50k cells in Excel to a PDF document? Give a generic summary of what is to be done here.  
**Deliverables**: This should be a bullet-pointed list of what will be performed. If it's a logo, etc. If it's a website, this should be a comprehensive list of what will be done, from designing the theme to installing plugins or writing custom programming elements. Anyone reading this section should be able to tell immediately what they are getting.  
**Payment**: Simply put-- how much, 50% on delivery-- put that and the exact $$ amounts. If it's hourly, include the hourly rate and payment schedule. Make sure to specify how the money will change hands (via Paypal, Credit Card, Check, etc).  
**Notes/Add-ons**: Any stipulations, then put that here.  
**Signature and Date**: There are many digital signing programs available to allow you to sign a document digitally. Use them. A contract is useless if it is not signed by both parties.  

I have made a sample contract as a public Google Doc available [HERE](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZKEnoSwc-7WFrxinzVXPU0J_Txgwt6E8jYOotrrANug/edit?usp=sharing) to help you out. This is an ACTUAL contract I have written, use it however you'd like.

**For Contractors**  

* Get paid up front. This doesn't mean you have to bill 100% up front, with at least 33% up front on fixed price jobs. If you're doing work hourly, estimate the number of hours it will take you to complete the project, and require that you be paid for 1/3 to 1/2 of the estimated time up front. Some clients may be worried about being out THEIR money as well, and hesitant to pay. While this is understandable, you need to give the client confidence in your abilities and reliability. Keep a list of references they can contact, or a link to your online feedback at a freelancing website like oDesk. Make it clear beyond a doubt that you are worthy of their trust, their money.    
* Log your time.  Even if you are doing a fixed-price contract
* Be organized.  Nothing is worse for your reputation or for your clients than when you accidentally space on a deadline. Use a project management system to keep track of deadlines
* When possible, like when doing copywriting, marketing, or other services.  But for things like graphics and logo design in particular, ONLY provide the client with watermarked, low resolution proofs until you have approval and final payment. Then you can deliver the final product. For situations where this is not possible, make sure you have plenty of payment milestones marked out along the way to ensure you don't do a TON of work and then end up not being paid with no recourse (unless you want to be a dick and take down their site/article/SEO work
* Get and give feedback. After a successful project is done, recommending them as a client. It's good for both of you!  

**For Clients**  

* Be specific. Make sure your job description and communications with potential contractors are specific and leave no question about what you expect to be done
* Cheaper does NOT mean better. You get what you pay for, or your logo for $20, but do not expect the experience to be easy or fun. If you want a contractor that knows their stuff, will deliver you quality results, and will not have to be micromanaged and/or you'll have to get someone else to fix the problems they leave behind-- raise your standards and your budget (if possible).  
* Be selective. Don't choose the first person that responds to your /r/forhire post. Many quality contractors on here only have time to check this sub once or twice a day, or two-- use it! Yes, you will be flooded by tons of PMs that you will have to sort through and find who will fit you best. But consider it like a normal job; you wouldn't normally hire the first person who walks through after posting a help wanted sign in your window-- why would you do the same for an online contract?  Take the time to carefully vet the people who apply and interview them.  Come up with a list of qualifications your ideal contractor would have, and a list of questions they should each be able to answer.  This will make the hiring process much easier for you, and you are more likely to end up with a great contractor that will provide you with excellent service.  
* Be open-minded. You may have a specific vision for your end result you'd like to see. Communicate that to the contractor, or that you most definitely do need an SSL certificate to take credit cards on your new website.  
* Protect your investment by staying involved.  Give useful and constructive feedback, database, etc.  You don't want to be stuck in a situation where you have no control over what is going on.  

**Problem Resolution (For Everyone)**

* Be amicable. If you have a dispute
* Use all channels of communication. At the start of this post
* Be persistent. If someone is non-responsive, or Google Voice.  Reach out to others in their company.  Be a google sleuth and find other means of contacting them, such as Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn. It won't take many posts on a public business Facebook page about ""resolving our dispute"" for them to contact you back.  
* If all else fails, so you have the paper trail on your side.  
*  Don't be vindictive. If you have a bad experience, as well. This also goes for holding assets hostage and/or removing websites from the internet until you get paid. Yes, you can do it, but I personally don't think anyone *should*.    
*  Remember that one bad apple does not ruin the bunch. If you've had a bad experience in a contract work situation-- that sucks

If there's anything I've left out

**More Resources**

[Mike Monteiro | F*ck You. Pay Me.](http://vimeo.com/22053820) - courtesy of /u/reokue

**Suggested additions to contract (some may only be needed for major contracts):**

* That payment of initial deposit indicates agreement
* Intellectual Property rights do not transfer until final payment has been made. This way if they use any of your work without paying you
* Firing offenses - on BOTH sides (yes
* Kill Fee - if the client terminates the contract early without good cause (outlined in contract)

5 Years ago my father closed his custom cabinetry shop in NJ which he owned and operated for nearly 25 years because of the rough economy. Since then he has been working various odd jobs doing home repairs, having lost a lot of money he was saving for retirement.

He tried for a while to find government jobs as he had worked for the government in buildings management prior to owning his business, he stopped applying to jobs all together, pretty much giving up on account of his age.

Please help my father find a job.

His credentials:

* -University of Rochester Graduate- B.A. History &amp; Political Science

* -About 6 years as a buildings manager for real estate companies and the government

* -Almost 30 years as a custom cabinet maker (highly skilled)

* -Certified NJ Home Inspector

* -Current Commissioner of a multi-county Sewerage Authority

* -Strong Writer

* -Migrant workers have commented that my father is a hard worker (Now that is a compliment!)

This is his LinkedIn Summary:

I am particularly interested in neighborhood preservation through the repair and remodeling of existing one to three unit structures. I also hope to use these projects to provide job training opportunities in the building 
trades and to apply LEED and ""green collar"" principles to renovation.

1304614464.0,h4xkw,Looking for work? I recommend recruiters.,solidwhetstone,80,20,58,"*It always surprises me to find out that a lot of people haven't even considered using recruiters or headhunters when looking for work. I'm not sure if they are just unaware of what the recruiter game is all about- or if they had a bad experience. I have had mostly good- sometimes mediocre results with recruiters- but always better results than simply looking for work on my own. Here are some of the pros and cons I have had with recruiters over the past 3-4 years:*

----------------
**Pros**

----------------

**Recruiters know people.** Very often, they pick up. Recruiters are dialed in to the specific roles these hiring managers are looking to fill, so they have their pulse on what's available right now.

**Recruiters are hungry.** Since recruiters get paid when they get you work- they work hard to get you employed. You don't pay them a dime during any part of the process- that's all handled by the employer. All you have to do is be a rockstar and get hired. Because you don't have to pay to use recruiters

**Using recruiters is a better use of your time.** You could talk to 3 companies in a week

**Interview less.** Many times

**Make more money (possibly).** This one isn't a guaranteed, and oversell you to their client so they can receive the best possible margin. Know what you're worth and be reasonable with your salary expectations. Talk to 5 different recruiters and see what they're willing to submit you at and you'll get a clear average of your monetary worth.

----------------
**Cons**

----------------

**Recruiters may try to undersell you.** There's always a chance a recruiter will try to inch you in at the same amount or just a tiny bit more than what you were making at your last job when you really deserve more. The best way to prevent this from happening is to talk to multiple recruiters to find out what you are worth. If you talk to 5 recruiters and one of them is pitching you far below the other 4, just tell them something like, ""I have made it a personal policy not to share that info with recruiters"" and move on with the conversation as quickly as you can. Be courteous with recruiters, but be firm. They work for you and you can drop them if you don't feel like they are looking out for your best interest.

**Recruiters may try to place you where you don't belong.** Sometimes

----------------
**How to find a recruiter and what to expect**

----------------

Finding recruiters is easy nowadays. Just hop on the google and do searches in your local area for 'recruiting agency,' and so on. See what comes up. Don't be afraid to go with small agencies- sometimes small firms can fish up big jobs! Also don't be afraid to talk to recruiters that aren't exactly in your job sector. Perhaps you are a systems admin- it's not wrong to talk to a corporate finance recruiter. They are friends or coworkers with other recruiters- or they have a financial client that is looking for a systems admin. It's never wrong to contact a recruiter- you may just have to hop around until you find the right person within a given staffing agency.

Once you go in to see a recruiter, it doesn't matter if the recruiter thinks you're a doof. If they like your resume and think you're qualified, they're going to try to place you. They may even give you pointers on how to better interview when you do go in to talk to a potential employer.

----------------
**Conclusion**

----------------

I hope these thoughts have been insightful for you in your job hunt. My most recent 2 jobs were the result of recruiters and they were jobs that very specifically fit with my skillset. I am back out on the market again- going on interviews- some referred from recruiters

----------------

Hey there, I want to say that I am not a recruiter; I am a regular employee who stands to gain a small bonus for each person hired and retained on staff for at least a few months, if not permanently. Because of this, I'm NOT an official source of info, but I'm ALSO not a fire-and-forget poster.

 * Is not temporary or seasonal. We're not going to cut you loose after a few months.

**THE DAY TO DAY**
*****
To give you a rough idea of what working at SDC is like, get clocked in and two or three tools turned on and ready to go. When your shift starts, you mark yourself as ready to take calls and wait. On busy days and times of day, you might get a call instantly. I think my busiest day ever was about 15-20 people in the queue for probably around 3 hours. It was back to back. On slow days, you might be sitting there doing very little for upwards of 15 minutes. Most days, the time between calls is around 5 minutes. Most calls last 10-20 minutes.

The customers we get have one of several services which they have already paid for. Typically, game consoles, mobile devices, and even some weird stuff on occasion. Familiarity with these will certainly help you out when you're working with them, but no, you do not have to already know how to use all of those.

We have very well-developed flow charts to guide you through the troubleshooting process for almost every issue. We don't do ""scripts""

We also have a regularly updated wiki-based knowledge base with information on almost everything you'll need to know. Weird problems that are brought to our attention by our customers or the companies we work with are added here and made known to the entire project's staff via email.

We also have very, directly with peers, or directly with supervisors. Responses are usually instantaneous when help is requested, and it's not uncommon for discussions to get a little bit off topic when things are slow.

**HOW TO APPLY**
*****
If you are interested in this position, or me, or both of us.

1. Go to [this website](http://www.support.com/about/careers/openings) and select Remote Services Technician. It's the featured position.

2. During stage 1, increasing the attention paid to your application and also potentially giving me a small bonus for finding you.

3. Proceed as normal through the resume section and other hiring info. There may or may not be a tech knowledge quiz involved. There was when I was hired

**I'll be frank, my industry has dried up almost completely. I have plans on going back to college to learn a new trade, maybe engineering, or maybe becoming a flight instructor. But for now I just need to do basically anything. 

I'm a smart guy, and have years of experience making television commercials for people all over the country. I'm also a martial arts and self defense expert. 

I'm also strong- 6'4"" 250, whether it's sitting at a desk all day, or working my tail off on the side of the highway. 

I know that people hiring aren't interested in desperate people looking for jobs

I have a clean driving record and NO criminal history. I'm a good person

Rhode Island is okay too. 


* **EDIT: I figure I should post what I'm good at/know how to do.**

* I am totally fluent in Photoshop, Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, MAC and PC. I know how to use Word, Excel, Powerpoint, etc. Here is a link to my work on Vimeo: http://vimeo.com/user6273524/videos

* I am familiar with basic IT roles- networking

* I am a good graphic designer, I can manage and do upkeep on websites. I'm very knowledgable in online marketing (PPC, and SEO). I can show some recent examples of all of these things. 

* I have lots of experience as a copywriter

* I'm a pilot

* I have a general knowledge of carpentry, and painting skill sets. I'm very, very handy and can build/repair almost anything easily. 

* I'm a fast learner! I can learn anything in under 30 minutes. I've done so many things in my life, to landing behind a 737 in a 1500 pound cessna with a 200 foot ceiling at an international airport or performing search and rescue activities in USAF aircraft, to framing houses with hammers and nails, that I don't need much hand holding. My current situation is a product of this recession, and I'm no longer going to be bummed about it. I'm going to accept it head on from here on out and hope that someone can find the kindness to give me a chance.

I'm late 20's, have 2 car payments, and lots of student loan debt. **I'm not going to give up.**

The long-story-short is that he has been struggling to find work here and there for years now, trade W to cover Z; always just to make it to the next time he finally gets cut a check.

I'm sick of it. I am a high-school drop out and I currently work in HVAC&amp;R controls and I make more than he does. This isn't right

My dad is a licensed General Contractor who has been building houses and whatnot for longer than I've been alive. On top of being a GC, and a whole swath of shit that I couldn't even begin to list. He also has his class A for trucks, but he'd MUCH rather be building than driving trucks.

That's the thing about my dad...He can do anything, sweltering heat or blowing snow. It doesn't matter. He's the guy who wakes up at 5 AM to snow-blow everyone's drive-ways before they have to leave for work, because it's the nice thing to do and he likes to keep busy. He's the hardest worker I know, and he knows his shit. When I was growing up, he watched ""This Old House"" to yell at the guy on the TV for the mistakes he was making while building things, or telling him how he could do it differently with a better outcome. It drove me crazy when I was a kid, but now I get that it was because he knew his shit.

When he builds houses, etc. He does everything right, to a T, all to code, everything. He doesn't build houses; he builds meticulous masterpieces that you can live in. Where one GC will build a house with a creaky floor board here and a leaking pipe there, he will not only *not* allow that to be called ""done"", but if it does happen, because it's the right thing to do.

He's the nicest, and one of the most knowledgeable people in his field. It destroys me that he has to fight every day just to fill his truck up, and that he's slowly had to sell off everything he's work for over my life just to be able to do so.

So I'm just throwing this out there. If you are, and I'll get you a resume. It doesn't matter where you are; my parents lost their house at the end of last year and they aren't anchored real tightly anymore. If you're in MN, ND, SC or FL though, that'd surely be a bonus to him.

I don't know what else to do. Thanks for listening. I hope someone out there has *something*.",,t5_2qzbh,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/forhire/comments/1givr5/this_isnt_for_me_its_for_my_dadnationwide_general/

1369667896.0,1f52ba,[Testimonial] Just wanted to give a shout out to someone I hired to help me with some HTML/CSS.,rob79,59,10,9,"/u/ankurkdotcom had a post offering his services and I took him up on the offer. I needed some basic changes made to an HTML/CSS/jQuery template that I bought for use as a personal website.  He make the changes very quickly (from getting in touch to everything being complete was less than 30 minutes - again these were small but necessary changes

His rates are very reasonable (I'm not going to say what he charged me since his rates probably vary depending on the complexity of the job, now that I know what to expect).  He's just starting out (and still in highschool) so now is probably a good time to hire this guy since his rates will only go up (and up...and up).  If you check out his website you'll see that he's not just doing copy/paste coding, he's created some really cool websites and definitely knows his stuff - a real self starter.

He has a website at [ankurk.com](http://ankurk.com) where you can get in touch with him. We did everything over Skype which made it all a very painless experience.

So that's it. I thought if anyone sees him offering his services on here were skeptical this might serve as a bit of a reference for Ankur. Feel free to look at my comment history and you'll see that I'm not some kind of shill

I'm not even that picky.  My criteria are simply that it be at least a step above retail (I'm fine with office work or customer service),000 (which is actually a little more than I'm living on now).

**Now for the important stuff: The percentage given to charity:**

* 5% Just for getting me a job
* 5% If it's in the film industry
* 5% If it's within 3 miles of me, etc. (La Cienega &amp; the 10)

This can easily turn into a couple grand going to charity.

I also have a history in over-the-phone customer service and office work.  While I'm most passionate about film, so a straightforward steady employment sounds really welcome right now.  I'm a quick learner and can adapt to about any job you guys can find for me.

I don't think Reddit is my personal army, but I'm getting close to the breaking point.  I've got a bank account with less than $10, and due to some medical issues, my parents aren't a safety net.  I don't want to give up and leave this city, or the people that I love who live here.  Since I had this idea, I've held off on asking for your help for months, until it's finally hit the point that my ""worry"" side of the scale outweighs the ""look like an entitled ass"" side.

I have a few projects up my sleeve that I don't really have time to sit down and code myself. I really enjoy teaching people and passing on my skills

Currently I'm an entrepreneur and a freelancer doing web applications for some big-name companies, Javascript, and PHP on the back-end.

If you have free time on your hands, and in return, you'll be *learning* while you code for me.

I don't know if anyone has done this before

As soon as you *graduate*, no strings attached.

If you're interested

------------

Skills that would be involved:

HTML (Old-and-new school, Javascript (jQuery is just tiny drop in the massive ocean that is Javascript), PHP (From spaghetti to full-fledged scalable apps), Photoshop (those designs won't cut themselves), HTTP and some basic networking protocols.

*Edit:* Some Source Control (SVN/GIT) will be learned also

--------

To give you some idea on what people are paying for developers these days:

A junior (some experience) Web Developer (HTML/CSS/Javascript/PHP) will earn around $15-$25 per hour

-------

*Edit:* The buzz words are there for a reason

-------

*Edit:* Wow! I didn't expect people to be so enthusiastic about the idea, I hope to reply to all of you who PM'ed me, but at the moment I'm afraid I'm going to stop taking on new *""students""*.

That being said, if that does happen I may or may not look for new people right away as I'm not expecting this to be extremely time consuming, so if you're interested, again, send me your email in a PM and I'll sure to contact you if and when that time comes.

I do consulting and occasional teaching work for Fortune Education, and would like to hire at least 2 new teachers to work at our center and to possibly do some external work at an area middle/high school. 

Details:

* 8k RMB starting monthly salary (about $1200 USD) with a raise to 10K RMB ($1570) after 2-3 months (depends on performance)

* Housing provided

* Transportation stipend as required for work

* Health insurance

* Airfare to and from China (provided upfront

* Free vacation after completion of a 1 year contract

Requirements:

* Bachelor's degree (any discipline) and two years work experience (does not need to be related to teaching)

* At least 25 years of age (required for a Chinese work visa)

* Native speaker of English, grammar, and spelling skills

* Valid passport with a couple empty pages (Chinese visas take up an entire page

* Be willing to undergo and finance a physical (including chest x-ray and EKG) as required for a Chinese work visa. Prices on this can vary. (We will reimburse you or pay the bill after you arrive in China

* Pay for the work visa and consulate fees up-front (reimbursed after you arrive)

* Be willing to commit to a 1 year contract term

* **Most importantly:** Be interested in working with ESL students. Enjoy working with kids. Have a sense of adventure and adaptability. Be creative and enthusiastic. View unfamiliar surroundings as interesting and exciting.

I know from experience that getting a job in China can be sketchy

My experience has been pretty awesome. I had an opportunity to study Chinese, so they are lots of fun and already speak decent English. The starting salary, while not terrific by US standards (most of the non-Chinese employees, including me, are American) is more than enough to live on. With housing included it ends up being pretty easy to put away $1k USD a month in savings, and  the income is tax free in the US (the Chinese income taxes are factored into your salary).

I messaged the mods of /r/Favors

I'm a very amateur sculptress

The unique situation - I would really like to have the money ASAP (which is why I tried to see if I could Trade in /r/favors). My bank account is in the hole because of an automatic CC payment

I work hourly and I work for family which means I get ZERO holiday pay; I'll get 20 hours on this next check. I'll have to figure out how I'm going to pay my $90 bank fee, and there is this nasty habit of eating that I'm plagued with. I'll be able to squeeze by if I can get this bank account sorted out. I know how to be poor, I don't know how to be in debt.

But I do know how to sculpt! Human forms are tough for me (an anatomy class is in my future..) I prefer creatures, but I haven't quite figured out how to replicate a nice looking blade with polymer clay.

I always received great references because I'm good with people and great at what I do

I dropped out of society last year and lived on the streets in Venice Beach and San Francisco, I dislike speedy things, paying for sex, and capitalism, so I got really down and ended up getting fired when I laid out of work for a week in protest of new bullshit organizational changes.  Basically, I have a hard time submitting to authority, especially when they're overgrown frat boys.

Then I went to live with my best friend and her family for a bit in PA, so I had to leave.

Now I'm staying with my parents in Georgia.  It's a pretty miserable experience, so sometimes she instigates it.  I have a midnight curfew, no money, and no car (although I'm selling this sweet rare 1915 Coca-Cola bottle for $300 soon--*crosses fingers*). No one around here will hire me because I'm overqualified or gay or don't go to church, and I failed the ridiculous subjective test for the Lionbridge Internet Assessors search rating telecommuting scam-job.

I had this great plan for starting my own non-profit website called e-busking.com, so I guess you could call it a pipe dream.

Basically I'm just looking for a way out of here before I lose my sanity.  I would hitchhike back to California or something

I don't really care what kind of work I get, digging in the dirt, playing the ukulele and singing, writing, philosophizing, cooking, and traveling.  So if you have something you think I'd be a good fit for, as long as I make enough to support myself and travel a little.  The only things I ever buy are cigarettes

I was not born deaf and I speak with proper enunciation. However

I have a B.S. in Computer Science and 2.5 years of professional experience with software development

I have experience using the following:

* C++, Python, Perl, Java, VB6, ColdFusion, JavaScript
* Linux, OpenWRT, FreeBSD, OpenBSD (I can perform most minor sysadmin tasks as well)
* IDA Pro (Reverse Engineering)
* STL, ATL, DirectX, .NET/Mono
* SQL Server, MySQL
* RF signal propagation (splat!)
* Google Maps APIs

I've used most debuggers, and I know how to write code injection libraries. 

I'm also a competent system integrator -- my last job had me create a complete Google Maps based web front-end for checking RF line of sight between possible locations. The actual programs ran on a dedicated server and returned both images and a PDF from the results. Before that, and creating a test harness to automate the most time consuming testing tasks to reduce the load on the software testers.

This is a bit of a repost; I posted similar job openings a couple months ago. For the sake of ease

I work as a consultant for a couple of schools in northeastern China


Details:

8k RMB starting monthly salary (about $1200 USD) with a raise to 10K 
RMB ($1500) after 2-3 months (depends on performance and qualifications)

Housing provided

Transportation stipend as required for work

Health insurance

Airfare to and from China (provided upfront

Free vacation after completion of a 1 year contract

Requirements:
Bachelor's degree (any discipline) and two years work experience (does not need to be related to teaching)

At least 25 years of age (Sadly

Native speaker of English, grammar, and spelling skills

Valid passport with a couple empty pages (Chinese visas take up an entire page

Be willing to undergo and finance a physical (including chest x-ray and EKG) as required for a Chinese work visa. Prices on this can vary. (We will reimburse you or pay the bill after you arrive in China

Pay for the work visa and consulate fees up-front (reimbursed after you arrive)

Be willing to commit to a 1 year contract term

Most importantly: Be interested in working with ESL students. Enjoy working with kids. Have a sense of adventure and adaptability. Be creative and enthusiastic. View unfamiliar surroundings as interesting and exciting.

I know from experience that getting a job in China can be sketchy

My experience has been pretty awesome. I had an opportunity to study Chinese, so they are lots of fun and already speak decent English. The starting salary, while not terrific by US standards (most of the non-Chinese employees, including me, are American) is more than enough to live on. With housing included it ends up being pretty easy to put away $1k USD a month in savings, and the income is tax free in the US (the Chinese income taxes are factored into your salary).

1337124397.0,tp1fw,A new subreddit for requesting and offering skills and projects,the-ace,43,9,9,"I've been trying to come up with a theme for a place where one could offer skills and request work very similarly to how r/forhire operates - a mishmash of providers and consumers that works in a very interesting way. I'm not going to elaborate on my observations and conclusions

That being said I've created [r/icando](/r/icando) as an experiment on publishing detailed work requests and offering specific skills *with the price tag visible to all*.

One of the things that are something of a divider in r/forhire's community is the debate about cheap labor and how cheap is cheap, and I know pretty well what I want.

The fact that the price is displayed upfront I hope will bring the best quality of work to the best price possible - because I as a web developer that usually takes between $70 and $100 per hour might see an interesting offer to build something that will take me 2 hours

-----

Like in r/forhire the subreddit will have *offers* and *reuqests*.

*Offers* are created by developers, artists, car washers, *Doers*, offering their *product* or *service* to the subreddit - the posts should include **[Offer]**/**[For hire]** in the title with a clear and understandable skill/product offer, and the post body should contain as detailed as possible description of the offer and *how much it costs*, it can be hourly/daily/weekly wage ($30 per hour,200 per month)

*Requests* are created by those who need something done - web pages, which can be one or more exact amounts you are willing to pay for the thing you need. For example I could request a new web site portfolio and I want to pay $200 for it, but I can go as high as $400 depending on the circumstances and the offered quality/finish. Some redditors will chose to offer to do the job for the $200, other swill offer for $300 and $400. Or so I hope.

The idea is to create a sort of r/forhire where everything is very clear from the get go, and even micro projects [for example: I need a custom designed wallpaper and I'm willing to pay $5 for it].

I hope that in a distant future the subreddit will become a small repository for offered jobs and skills

1) objectives / personal statements are a waste of space.  you're not a fucking CEO and you have no idea what real objectives are.  when writing about your experience, get rid of it.

2) get to your projects quicker and focus on YOUR contributions to each project.  if you did a lot of projects at a single company, because while I know what LAMP is, there's always some hiring fucktard who doesn't.  if the job listing says LAMP, say ""Linux/Apache/MySQL PHP (LAMP)"" at least once.  that gets you by filters.  INCLUDE LINKS IF POSSIBLE.  if you do backend work, set up a dummy section on one of your own sites.  dummy systems tell me a lot (that you know how to go out of your way to demonstrate competence).

3)   **this is probably one of the most important things on your resume: STATS GET YOU HIRED**... db size, bounce rate, conversions, signup rate, open rate, CPM, CPC

4) if you're a US citizen, that substantially increases the cost to hire and retain the non-citizen (or at least for companies like ours that actually comply with immigration laws).  that means in many cases, even if you're slightly shittier than a foreigner, i'll hire you.  it's not even salaries.  no one has to pay a fucking lawyer.  we don't have risk in the H1-B lottery.  it's just better all around.  a lot of the time, i'm stuck guessing by your name and universities.  don't make me guess.

I also have have a few years of computer science under my belt (before I switched to economics), so I'm not scared of the technical side of the business.

Mods: I didn't know where to post this

Okay reddit, so bear with me for a minute.

The situation: 

In an attempt to live a life less ordinary I've planned an epic journey to spend Dec. 21, I know it's not the end of the world, it's a celebration of a new beginning and a new era, the 14th B'aktun of the Long Count Calendar and it's a major celebration in the Mayan culture. I try to live the life of adventure as much as possible and travel when I can, but I've not left the US since I was 5 and I don't even really remember that trip.

The problem:

Where the trouble comes in is that I have failed to raise the money for the trip. I live on the road on the Renaissance Faire circuit and the depressed economy is killing my sales so I've just made enough to live on

The proposal:

I am offering my service to anyone who will help me achieve this dream of mine. In exchange for a donation I will perform any task you appoint me and provide proof of accomplishing the task
 command! (Oh

I submit myself to your will

My target to successfully reach is $1500.00

I'll be couch surfing and camping during this trip so lodging is not an issue. Just food and travel money.

The details: 

If this works out and I make it there my itinerary will be thus:
12/15/12 Arrive in Guatemala city
12/16/12 GC
12/17/12 GC
12/18/12 Lanquin in the highlands
12/19/12 Lanquin caves/Semuc Champey waterfalls/Grutas Las Marias
12/20/12 Tikal
12/21/12 Tikal and Volcan Pacayan
12/22/12 Antiqua
12/23/12 Return to the US

I will happily perform any task in any of these places

Do you need a love letter to an old flame or a note to your grandma hand-delivered in the region?
Do you want a picture of me with a shoe on my head at Tikal?
Does your Uncle need a couch moved?
Want to watch a video of a guy almost break his neck in an Ostrich rodeo?
Just want to live vicariously through a random person? 

I'm your man.

I'll take donations via paypal, I want an adventure. Whatever proof or verification of identity you guys demand, I will provide. This is not a throwaway, this is my real account. I'll also provide FB details, email, whatever you think you need.

I'll check in on this post every 1-2 hours as long as my connection holds out. I'm on faire site and the wifi here is very spotty

I leave my fate in your hands

1354663542.0,14af9v,HR specialists--a few questions about cover letters.,Agent00funk,32,3,19,"Hello

First and foremost

So I have been (unsuccessfully) writing cover letters for far too long. I'd like to ask you what HR specialists look for in cover letters. For example, is it better to come across as as a reliable worker bee, or is it better to come across as more personable. What I am trying to get it is, should I describe myself in terms of ""I did x, then I did y, my responsibilities included z, and I am proficient in xyz"", but I find it hard to get the balance between worker bee and individual and I'm not sure which of those two is actually desirable. 

Also, and my"". Is this standard, or am I simply bad at writing these things?

How aggressive/assertive should I be? Should I tell potential employers that ""I know I'll be a good fit"", this is a balance I'm finding hard to strike since I don't know if I should come at it with a sort of cocky attitude or if I should be humble.

Should my cover letter reflect my CV, or should I use my cover letter to talk about things that are not in my CV? 

I've been told that in writing a cover letter I should try and tell the employer what I can offer their company/organization/etc.

I am Dave Stiles
I have an Associates degree in ACT focusing on Green Design. I got my degree from Baker College in Muskegon Michigan. When I was at Baker College there were no programs for green design. As a result I began the research and devlopment for the courswork for green concepts and green technology and presented it to the Academic Advisary board for the ACT program. Because of my presentation the board asked me to join them as a student advisor for the Baker College ACT program. Ultimately Baker College incorporated green design and technology into the ACT curriculum.
I also have experience in 3D CAD design for private manufacturars and residential/small commercial construction. Several of my designs have been bought by private clients. 
I also have 20 years experience in the field. My specialty is drywall installation, framing, landscaping, minor elecrical and plumbing, paintng, cabinetry, doors and windows, and geneal facilities maintence. Basically I can build anything given the chance.
Recently I moved my family from Muskegon Michigan to Houston looking for employment. Bringing the family is also bringing more experience. My son and daughter have been working by my side since they could swing a hammer. My son has 10 years experience and my daughter has 7. My son's fiance has also been in the family business for 5 years

The long hair guy always keeps it up in a pony tail.

I'm asking because I have had no luck getting a job although I have had a few interviews and I've heard that the stigma that guys with long hair are hippies and such might be part of the reason.

Edit: I have an interview at a fast food place and the dress code is hair above the collar for men. I have really long hair and keep it in a pony hair, etc. Should I get a haircut before the interview or just wait to see if I get the job?",,False,,t5_2qzbh,1348933884.0,,

*Important Info up front:* NDA and 1yr non-compete agreements ultimately required from you

Please creepily stalk my reddit history if you need more proof I'm a normal trustworthy guy. I’m sure you can find out more through there than I would feel comfortable revealing to you. *Awkward smirk* 

I will, while we get started I can even pay you as often as daily for your work. I would prefer we change that to weekly or biweekly, however (less work for me is good)

So with that out of the way: 

---------------

**I had a great idea recently!!** You see

I want(need) to expand it more quickly than I can right now
 
I need you to list new products on my website. (and update old ones) I have a spreadsheet of the items available to add, manufacturer, short description. For the rest, you will find the info available on amazon, manufacturer, and a few niche-related websites (our partners). I will provide these resources to you. 

You will be responsible for reviewing the information, instruction manuals, related items, etc. I will answer any questions you have about the product lines and product themselves (as I am an expert in this regard and do it full-time). Finally you will need to categorize the products so visitors can find and browse them logically. 


We can discuss whether you prefer payment-per-results ($5/product) or hourly ($10/hour). I’m looking for 10-30 hours or 20-60 products per week right now. Expected time necessary per product is roughly 30 minutes. The amount of work I can give you will go up if this works out for us both. We won't run out anytime soon with about 20k individual products that can be added.

---------

**SOME GUIDELINES:**

-	REQUIRED: Know how to write HTML! Not whole websites! My website is template driven, etc. More ability is fine but won’t be required.
-	Understand some basic SEO as far as content goes (its not complicated)
-	Be interested in technology and electronics-inclined. Not just into buying cool products
-	Have acceptable grammar
-	Very light Photoshop work (mostly resizing or changing filetype) required
-	Experience with beginner level electronic components, residential electricity, lighting, security, climate, telephone/cable, and entertainment**
-	All work will be done through an online admin panel interface. (WORK FROM ANYWHERE) I will teach you the ropes as necessary, or email. Or phone/audio/video if you need to. Any questions about the products etc will be answered in an hour or less (but most often immediately).
-	If you have experience with ecommerce or web development
-	Payment by electronic funds transfer (preferred), gift card, or whatever the heck it is you prefer.
-	NOTE I am not a huge corporation

-    This is part-time work. IF you are looking for something reliable and very long-term, please dont!

-------

Sound like something for you? Tell me a little about your experience with consumer/household electronics, etc. A formal resume and/or real examples of your work/experience/interests will be huge pluses. 
I will tell you as much as I feel comfortable revealing, then I will tell you every single thing you want to know as well as give you access to the data and website(s) of our partners.


**I hope this can help someone** because I know finding the right person will be helping me. I really can’t believe I waited this long to come to reddit with the idea of using it for outsourcing!! I’ve been struggling through it myself all this time….. I was also considering using elance or amazon turk etc but that would not be as flexible methinks.  I think Reddit is where it’s at! 

Now it’s your turn to prove I’m right! PM or email me with info and questions: easyisle@gmail.com and we'll get crackin ASAP. That was long! Thanks for reading :)

The project is fairly straight forward. We have computers out in the field power by solar energy and connected via 3g. The computer grabs some data from an embedded system (RS-232 Interface) and provides an interface for that data. An application that lives on the server will periodically query all of the field computers for data and provide a more extensive interface for that data. Then there is a front-end web interface that serves up this data in a pretty way.

I need somebody that can not only perform the tasks I outline for them

It was really amazing to see genuine and significant increases in productivity when a task with clearly defined patterns was made 90-100% automated.

For example, terminations, etc) and this person would have to manually filter and edit the data in Excel. They would then work out the number of employees (full-time equivalent and headcount) for each division, as well as commencements, terminations, excessive leave balances, and a few other things. This was done by filtering the data from the HRMS over and over and saving it into countless spreadsheets. Then this data would be sorted and copied into a template Word document for each division.

Within about a week I was able to turn this into a 20 minute process by creating an Access database. The team member now uses an easy form to import the HRMS data files and Access will generate all the reports and save all the data in tables for later reference. I was able to exactly mimic the Word documents that were being created before by hand

So this process would previously take 24 hours (3*8 hour days). The team member is paid about $35/hr (Australian wages are higher than our US counterparts). Creating these monthly reports manually is costing the organisation about $840 each month, but I think it at least gives an indication of worth.

Now of course that is a fairly extreme example. A smaller example is a process I have automated for another team. The team creates relatively formulaic written reports (not data like the other one) about four times a week. These reports don’t take a long time to complete,820 per year.

These were done in VBA using Microsoft Office because that was the easiest tool to use with that organisation
So now I’ve decided to do this freelance for other businesses in my spare time. A one-man operation with a full-time day job means I won’t be able to take on anything ridiculously large

Some of the modules for the first two years I've covered include; Structural Mechanics, Circuit analysis, Computer Aided Engineering, Airframe Structures, Dynamic Systems, Aerodynamics and many others.

A project I worked on in the first year was to design and build a rocket assisted glider which would carry a payload of one egg and construct a business proposal for it. 
We had a number of set backs within the team, CAD drawing and think about sourcing the material (the actual material was provided). When the glider was constructed we were very proud of it, she was a real beauty. When it finally came to testing it we attached the rocket and put in the egg and I pressed to button to launch. It went seven meters along the ground and literally exploded a little.
I thought about the reason for a while and came up with a reason. Because the project was rushed with such a small work force we had neglected to consider how the rocket was attached and our improvised solution was two rubber bands and some tape. The rocket immediately tilted the glider nose down. Also there was an ejection charge on the rocket we had forgotten about

Let's start.

I am a senior at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte
I will soon have a BS in Economics with a Liberal Arts emphasis, and how consumers react to the many factors of the market.  Economics, to me, is the study of how to live in a world of **limited resources** with an **infinite number of wants and needs of it's inhabitants**.  Too cool for words.
 
I worked two techie jobs (Classroom support and then A/V technician) for the school, and it is easily the most poppin' building on campus.  A year ago I was promoted to the  ""Ambassador of the Student Union"".  Since then, I have represented the union on numerous occasions throughout campus, gave orientation to many new employees, orientation to thousands of incoming freshmen and transfer students, and have been on the planning board to host an extremely large (Association of College Unions United) conference at UNC Charlotte's Union this weekend.

During my time at University I have accrued 180 hours of community service with our disability services organization.  I won an essay contest hosted by [Mont Blanc](http://www.montblanc.com/flash/#/) called the ""Signature for Good"" competition

I have recently obtained my *CrossFit Level 1 Trainer Certification*, high intensity, functional movement.  We train to develop an increased work capacity across broad time, modal domains and age.  *Please watch that video!*  I love CrossFit.

I am also pretty darn good at cooking.  [Here is my website](www.nerdpluspaleo.com) - disclaimer: I am a poor college student.  Everything tastes good

**Why am I posting this in r/gaming might you ask?**
Because I am a nerd.  I am a nerd at heart

1372028828.0,1gxmxu,[For Hire] Desperate In Dallas,TheDemonClown,21,2,9,"The title sums it up

I moved to southeast Dallas with my roommates a couple of months ago because it looked like there'd be more opportunity for better money here than in Abilene.  However, and/or years of experience with a trade skill.  I've filled out hundreds of applications since arriving and have only gotten 2 interviews in 2 months, both yielding nothing.  My nearly depleted savings forced me to accept a job at a warehouse in Irving via a staffing agency, but the commute is brutal - in addition to 4 trains &amp; 2 buses a day, I've also had to walk over 25 miles in 4 days just getting to &amp; from work, where I spend 6-8 hours a night on my feet in a hectic warehouse.  The cherry on top of all this is that I've only eaten a sandwich &amp; 2 dollar menu burgers in the last week because all of my money has to be saved for weekly bus passes.  So...yeah...*desperate*.

I would like to get into something IT-related, to get an internship/apprenticeship where I can learn *and* get paid.  I've got a sharp eye for detail, I type over 100 words per minute, I'm a very fast learner, I'm never late or absent unless seriously ill, I've got the strongest work ethic of anyone I know, and I'm great with scheduling, &amp; other clerical/office work.  I've spent most of my adult life working in hotels

There are only 3 things I really require:

- Nothing that would put me near human bodily waste/garbage at all (I have a severe mysophobia &amp; those things send me into panic attacks).
- Something that I can commute to without physically exhausting myself before I even show up and
- Something that I can get to during DART hours

I'm currently an active duty USAF Captain that's looking to separate later this year.  My wife and I have a baby on the way, so we're tied to the San Antonio, TX area for the next few years.  
  
Here's a brief summary of my experience:  
  
* BS (2002) and MS (2004) in Mechanical Engineering  
* ~2 years manufacturing engineering experience (aircraft parts)  
* Commissioned in USAF in 2006  
* ~2 years developmental engineering experience (rocket engines &amp; missile defense tech)  
* 1 year as an executive officer  
* ~3 years as a Special Agent with AFOSI (with the security clearance that comes with that) 
  
So, TX area, or something that can be done from home.  Please PM for more details, as I've left quite a bit out for brevity.

“Well that’s awfully vague.  What kind of work? What are your skills? Why should I hire you?”


Good questions! 


Let me tell you about my work history and education so you have a better understanding of who I am


First, and an appreciation for the 
importance of time management.


Secondly, my loyalty to the organizations I work for, and my outstanding communication skills.


Before my work as a manager and a bartender, and necessitated that I always take the initiative.  Because I was able to consistently demonstrate these skills, I quickly became the number one courier for the firm that I rode for.


In addition to my time in the bar and my tenure on the bicycle, banquet cook, and more.  As you can see from this diverse work and education history, I am the kind of person who loves to try new things and learn new skills – in fact, that might be my most valuable attribute for any employer: I just really enjoy learning.


Currently, and watch as it, I hope, blossoms.  However, being an optimistic entrepreneur still leaves me with weekends free and I would like to fill that time by working for you!


So, clean your shop, or wait tables at your restaurant – I could be just the guy you’re looking for!

Our QA group keeps us in check and even helps with the automated testing.

**What we’re looking for**

We’re looking for people passionate about software development. If you have side projects, then you sound like a great fit. We believe a strong foundation of data structures, algorithms, and design patterns is important.

There was a post asking for the ability 2 years ago

We are on extremely limited bandwidth and testing rar vs 7z the difference is enough to save month on bandwidth overages if we can reduce the uploads even more.

As it currently stands

    ""C:\Program Files\7-Zip\7zG.exe"" a -mx9 C:\test.7z @C:\fileList.txt

If those files are in the following format

    C:\Program Files......\file.exe

BUT if you remove the C:\ portion, and since the backup is completely relative there is no way to me to backup both identically named folders on drive C and E and keeping the structure inside the archive separated.

Could i do two 7z files

1. Is is possible? I use 7zG.exe via command line (so i get the gui view) so a switch would be best to trigger the full-path ability.
2. How much and how long to implement?
3. I would request it be submitted to 7-Zip if they would be willing to implement it.

Thoughts and ideas on other ways to implement this are welcomed. If anyone knows it's possible and can give me a quote

I am a busy photographer in need of two or three editors. You will be editing wedding shots 90% of the time.


I am looking for someone with experience, so you will need to have the appropriate software (preferably CS 5 and lightroom 3).


I am going to pay **$125.00** per wedding. you will have approx 600 images to edit and you will have a weeks time to do it. WITH THAT SAID, therefore, I am technically paying around $13.00 /hr (and remember, you will have a whole week to get them done.). Also, after you have edited 3 weddings for me, your rate will go up to **$150.00** per wedding.


The reason I can do 600 edits in 8 hrs is because I A) know what I am doing, or you think there is still no way you can tackle 600 QUALITY edits in 8-10 hrs, then this position is probably not for you.


Please message me telling me about yourself and your background. I will contact the people I'm interested in and ask for samples of your work. We will then go from there.

If we end up working together


Thank you very much! I look forward to hearing from you guys (and girls). you can view some of my work here: www.kristopherjamesphotography.com

1306024347.0,hh017,[For Hire] Recent Law School Graduate,kashk5,17,1,5,"Greetings

My name is Kash, I am open to other positions that fit my skill set. While I would prefer a position in Orange County, I am open to the possibility of relocating to anywhere else within California. 

**Experience**

I have worked for two solo practitioners as a Law Clerk. The first specialized in bankruptcy law, managed documents, assisted in client interviews and performed other administrative work. 

I was an extern at California Superior Court, and attended all court proceedings. I had the opportunity to shadow two judges during the summer, as opposed to the one judge most externs get to shadow. 

I was a Research Assistant for the Department of Political Science back in college. My research focused primarily on demographics and immigration patterns that would be used by the Governor for his then upcoming trip to India. 

I have assisted my family in forming a food services company. We started with a restaurant and banquet facility, drafting, and modifying most of the relevant contracts, and I orchestrated the design and launch of the company's website. 

**Education**

I just received my Juris Doctorate, Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Physics, and all of their respective labs. 

At law school, I helped form a new student organization that focused on philanthropic work. I believe this showcases my leadership ability and that I am a highly personable individual.
 
**Skills**

I have LexisNexis Professional Research Certification. I can speak Urdu/Hindi and have a rudimentary grasp of Spanish (I am learning to become more proficient in Spanish). As a Redditor,,False,,t5_2qzbh,False,,True
