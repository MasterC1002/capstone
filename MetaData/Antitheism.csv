I assure you I am.

Why

Hitler is Führer.

Wir mussen die Juden ausrotten.

But not all Nazis fit into your catergory of ""bad"".

Most of us are good people.

I mean

Obviously

Nobody in their right mind would kill someone simply because they were a Jew.

That part of Führer's speeches are metaphorical.

In fact

Ever.

Death is more of a metaphor on politics.

You wouldn't understand

Communists aren't that bad either.

I know Hitler says we should kill communists.

But you can still be a Nazi and disagree with some of what Hitler says.

I have a confession.

I've never actually read Mein Kampf or heard Hitler speak.

I get the gist of it though;

Aryan supremacy is important because Mein Kampf says it is.

Mein Kampf is right because Aryan supremacy is important.

Honestly

Besides

You don't lose anything.

If you don't want to kill Jews

All you need to do is accept Adolf Hitler as Führer.

Nothing else really counts.

Where do you get off judging all Nazis by a few bad ones?

We're not all extremists.

Most of us are really tolerant.

But I assure you

It's really rude to say I'm not one because I like Jews.

It's generalizing

Besides

What

You owe your life to the Nazi Party.

Look at the state of our government. Look at the state of our country.

How could you attribute that to anyone *but* Führer?

Not all Nazis are the same.

I'm a good person.

You don't need to take all the teachings literally.

The holocaust wasn't really *caused* by Nazis.

The people in World War Two just happened to be Nazis.

Besides

Ideas change over time

I personally choose to be a Nazi

So

I get that. 

Personally

But there *is* a lot of evidence for relativity...

Perhaps I believe in both.

After all

And this theory is as good as yours.

When it all boils down

It's protected by my rights.

You can't tell me what to believe.

My opinion is just as valid as yours.

Just to clarify

And you can't judge us all based on a few.

Just look at me;

Am I not moral? 

Am I not good?

I am a Nazi.

I assure you I am.

You just wouldn't understand.

You're not a Nazi.

You poor brown eyed soul.

My brother and I had a good laugh about it, and loving mother spewing such insane nonsense. They are very religious, and completely eat up every ounce of bullshit their church feeds them. AND IT FUCKING KILLS ME TO WATCH. How can people be so deeply brainwashed that they can ignore factual evidence. Not just to do their own research, but to just throw it out. Fuck that.

Why do we hold any reverence for these people? Shouldn't they be institutionalized? They claim to speak to things that aren't there. They claim the things talk back. THEY CLAIM THE THING DOES THINGS FOR THEM. THEY CLAIM THE THING CONTROLS EVERYTHING. They base ALL OF THIS off a fictional book that dates to the beginning of recorded history. Can't we round these people up? If you substituted any other word for ""god"" or ""jesus"" in the shit religious people say they would be sent to insane asylums immediately. Why is religion so much different?

Religion is a fucking cancer on the human race. Scratch that, hands down. Religion is leaving the majority of the population in a never ending state of retardation. And yes, LITERALLY retarded. Because I know the goddamn definition of literally. And I know what I've seen from religion. It's fucking disgusting. I hope to live long enough to witness the fall of religion.

1354829647.0,14elxa,I was asked if I thought the DNA evidence and human genome disproved the Bible by a Christian friend. This was my response:,PureMath86,90,15,24,"To answer your question from the other day more directly
Genetics has proven the Adam and Eve story to be purely a myth. Without the Adam and Eve story there is no 'Original Sin.' Without 'Original Sin' there is no need for 'Salvation.' Without a need for 'Salvation' there is no need for 'Jesus.' Without 'Jesus' there is no Christianity.

The whole of the religion is built on a story that did not happen. All the evidence contradicts it --100% of the genetics, etc.
This particular narrative, given the evidence, that it is a human construct. It is prone to corruptibility and flaws. But it has a key feature. It satisfies our need to understand the world around us --it provides us with a narrative-- it yields a sense of purpose.

But a more realistic approach is to be scientific

The religious answer is always one of divine revelation --dictation-- fascism. The scientific answer is always one of reason. It may mean that you have to approximate the result before all the information is in --before there is a sufficient amount of evidence collected. But I'd rather be partially right and open to better explanations than to purport a failed hypothesis --one that is demonstrably false.

Ethics is something like this. The ethics of the Old Testament are horrible. The ethics of the New Testament are much better. This is not a testament to our 'creator' or to his divine 'grace, if it does not conform to reason and withstand evidence. For example, the views on women and homosexuals are lacking merit. 

So in my personal opinion, I can demonstrate things that are contradictory and would refute the existence of 'particular' deities. Jesus Christ for example is easy to refute with actual evidence (not biblical myths about what the historical figure supposedly said or did). Jehovah is even easier --he does not possess an absolute moral code but the claims are that he does.

So where does this leave us? Well, it leaves us with a responsibility to our fellow man --and in light of the potential and actual horrors of religion --its stifling effect on the use of reason and the accepting of truth, not to mention all the heinous crimes it permits and in many cases commands... it is of dire importance that we combat it.

They see their life, the people they love, their family, as just a test.  To see if they deserve heaven.  They cheapen the world around them

So, aren't merely behind the times. I also want to say, they are theological illiterates. These people make all sorts of category mistakes about the nature of god. 

&gt;Because, more or less successfully, treatises about the nature and history of everything. In fact, as a theologian, I would want to say that god isn't another object that exists in the universe. In fact, **god doesn't exist at all.** God is existence. Or, as mystics might want to say, god contains within god's self all things including contradictions.

This was spoken by Melissa Raphael-Levine, August 25, 2010.

So

Check out the subreddit sidebar or the wiki page for the current topics.

It is brand-new, we invite anyone who has relevant input.

For example, prohibiting birth control and personal choice. The overt purpose is to raise an army of the next generation who will fight in Armageddon against non-Christians. It can be called a Christian Eugenics/Breeding program, with the sole purpose of out-populating rival groups.

The subreddit is looking for specifics, and lay it next to what Jehovah's Witnesses do, and find the similarities and differences.

Ok

* Faith is a virtue
* Questioning is disrespectful of authority
* Authority should be obeyed
* Obedience is a virtue
* Kill unbelievers

In discussion with friends about this I keep finding myself drawn back to the first idea, then everything else they might believe is also called into question.

Its no coincidence that all religions require faith and promote it. They also seem happy to have little truces and cease-fires with each other, its as if they recognise that the most important thing is that people accept that ""believing in things because you want to is just fine, doesn't matter if its true"" than ""my madeup thing is better than your imaginary thing"".

Its like religions are all agreeing not to call each other out on their bullshit. 

I mean, delusional, embarrassing, corrupt, nonsense, or the devils work, yet despite this they are willing to work together sometimes, as if faith itself is the important thing.

While on one level I support inter-faith dialogue

In terms of defeating religion, or a main religion splinter, etc. Fighting the symptoms, even successfully, might not get rid of the problem.

It is from this talk that Hitchens said that religion should be treated with ""ridicule, which is in line with the description on the sidebar, that 

&gt;this community is made for those of us who find religion repugnant to human progress, but openly criticize their beliefs without fear of reprisal or social backlash.

I think the backlash Harris and Dawkins are experiencing stem from the lack of organized condemnation religion receives today and the unintentional protection liberal theism lends to the fringes. Sure, but the only people who are openly critical of it in all regards and noticed are very few and far between. Only a handful of names are really associated with antitheism, and the most vocal and prominent of them all passed away almost two years ago. Hitchens was a self-described anti-theist. Harris is critical of religion, especially Islam as of late, but doesn't appear to consider himself as an anti-theist. Likewise, Dawkins is very critical but hasn't used the term to my knowledge. 

A google search of antitheism just brings up a bunch of definitions

So I ask, humanism, and atheism, but I can find few that have a focus like this sub. Every few days, a post is submitted to /r/atraxi that is exactly the reason why I hold religion in contempt. The videos often have little to do with America or American Christianity, but all I see is a different side of the same die displaying different versions of the same untruth, and I think that making that connection with liberals theists more evident or obvious is the most important point to make.

Apparently the White House referred to Christmas Trees as “Holiday Trees” for the first time this year which prompted CBS presenter

The following was written by Ben Stein and recited by him on CBS Sunday Morning Commentary.

My confession:

I am a Jew, Christmas trees. I don't feel threatened. I don't feel discriminated against. That's what they are, Christmas trees.

It doesn't bother me a bit when people say, it's just as fine with me as is the Menorah a few hundred yards away.

I don't like getting pushed around for being a Jew, that America is an explicitly atheist country. I can't find it in the Constitution and I don't like it being shoved down my throat.

Or maybe I can put it another way: where did the idea come from that we should worship celebrities and we aren't allowed to worship God? I guess that's a sign that I'm getting old

In light of the many jokes we send to one another for a laugh

Billy Graham's daughter was interviewed on the Early Show and Jane Clayson asked her: “How could God let something like this happen?” (regarding Hurricane Katrina). Anne Graham gave an extremely profound and insightful response. She said: “I believe God is deeply saddened by this, to get out of our government and to get out of our lives. And being the gentleman He is, I believe He has calmly backed out. How can we expect God to give us His blessing and His protection if we demand He leave us alone?”

In light of recent events... terrorists attack, her body found a few years ago) complained she didn't want prayer in our schools, and we said OK. Then someone said you better not read the Bible in school. The Bible says thou shalt not kill, thou shalt not steal, and love your neighbour as yourself. And we said OK.

Then Dr. Benjamin Spock said we shouldn't spank our children when they misbehave

Now we're asking ourselves why our children have no conscience, their classmates, and themselves.

Probably

Funny how simple it is for people to trash God and then wonder why the world's going to hell. Funny how we believe what the newspapers say, people think twice about sharing. Funny how lewd, crude, vulgar and obscene articles pass freely through cyberspace, but public discussion of God is suppressed in the school and workplace.

Are you laughing yet?

Funny how when you forward this message

Funny how we can be more worried about what other people think of us than what God thinks of us.

Pass it on if you think it has merit.

If not

My Best Regards

Ben Stein

With the US elections fast approaching

This is highlighted in the case of Branch Ministries Vs Rossotti where full page advertisements were taken to discourage the voting of Bill Clinton. The only problem with this case is how obviously unambiguous it is
Ironically when claiming they had been individually prosecuted and claimed their selection was a violation of the equal protection clause of the fifth amendment

In the USA the church is not required to file forms 990 as other 501(c)3 organisations are.  Nor are they required to make these available for inspection upon request as other 501(c)3 organisations do.

In effect the financial arrangements of the church remain completely unchecked and wide open to all manner of corruption. Churchgoers will be unaware of the percentage of donated monies used for lobbying government over helping the poor and needy.  The amounts paid out to silence victims of child abuse remain concealed

IRS rules prevent any organisation from engaging in actively supporting or campaigning against a particular political candidate. Failure to abide by the IRS rules can lead to the revocation of an organisation as is shown in the case  cited above.
It is estimated anything from a quarter to a half of a typical American city or town's ""public"" buildings are owned by the church and despite many if not most being used for business purposes and not religious matters


For some perspective here, it's time this unfair privileged exemption is challenged and revoked from all religion.

Keep an eye out for any clear violations of the IRS rules where it concerns the endorsement or attack of any particular candidate. Keep newspaper cuttings

I need to take a detour for a moment.

Mormons are quick to deny that paying tithing is required to go to heaven.

Let's disprove this denial.

According to the [""Preach My Gospel"" manual that all Mormon missionaries use to teach about the church:](http://www.lds.org/manual/doctrines-of-the-gospel-student-manual/chapter-15-the-covenant-of-baptism?lang=eng)

- Baptism is required of us if we are to enter the kingdom of God 

- Baptism is necessary for us to become members of the Church of Jesus Christ upon the earth

- Baptism must be performed by one having authority (i.e. an ordained Mormon Priest)

By this

But

During the interview with the Mormon Bishop, the two highest bodies in the LDS Church.

- Live the principles of moral worthiness (i.e. no sex outside marriage

- Live the Word of Wisdom (i.e. no booze, no tobacco, no illegal drugs, no meat between Spring and Fall)

- **Commit to pay tithing.**

**TL;DR: Paying tithing is required for baptism. Baptism is required for going to heaven.**

-----

End of detour.

We now know that tithing is required by the LDS church for its members to go to heaven.

At some point

Property Reserve falls within this web

1. Mormons pay tithing to avoid hell

2. The Mormon Church buys properties

3. The Mormon Church sells expensive properties to its top leaders for $10

4. The Mormon Church helps them them sell the property

5. ~~Prophet~~ Profit

Normally, you'd change your idea to either incorporate the theory if your idea still offered more explanatory power, or drop the idea completely if it did not.

Such is not exactly the case when theological claims to truth are challenged in the same way. The only recourse when a theological idea is proven completely wrong is to re-interpret the basis for the idea to allow the theory to co-exist with it

They cannot simply edit the bible, or at the very least inspired, by a God that has omnipotence, benevolence, and omniscience credited to it. Although I guarantee that the different sects of Christianity could never agree on allowing one group or person to edit the bible, even if they did, by inserting their own values, not a source of it.

The only question left is, and citations of mistranslations until it completely loses all validity among Christians? If they attempt to edit the bible to be more accurate to the facts and more reflective of modern morality, it could be the death of Christianity.

Government still funds the church

You become a member at birth if only one of your parents is a member. You need the signature of both to be deleted from the church registry before the age of 18. 

The ""state church"" is still not a legal entity that can be sued like the rest of the other ""belief organizations""

According to polls the majority of the population are either atheist or agonstic (54 %). Including those who say that religion is not really important in their lives we are up to 86%. How can this be !?! (2% of church members attend church on a regular basis)

People use the church for traditonal purposes. They get married in chruch

The church could not elect it's own leaders until now. The government did it

Church services during Christmas hardly contains any christian content at all. In my opinion the church is smart and adapt to the audience (most people attend curch once a year (christmas) unless some relatives have died... Funerals etc.

Those who really are religous are not among the 80% of the population who are members of the church as they do not precieve it as christian enough. They are members of other more fundamentalist churches. Less than half of the 20% who are not members are atheists.

The church has been held by their ears so hard by the government that they could not really be controversial

if that happens i guess that most people will still not give a fuck and still be members as it gives no tax benefits for not being a member. However

Right now we have a fossil of a religious system that will remain untouched because noone bothers to do anything about it.

""In the way that skepticism is sometimes applied to issues of public concern, to ignore the fact that, deluded or not, supporters of superstition and pseudoscience are human beings with real feelings, who, like the skeptics, are trying to figure out how the world works and what our role in it might be. Their motives are in many cases consonant with science. If their culture has not given them the all the tools they need to pursue this great quest

Clearly there are limits to the uses of skepticism. There is some cost-benefit analysis which must be applied, should we not keep our misgivings to ourselves?  But the issue is tricky.  Imagine that you enter a big-city taxicab and the moment you get settled in, the driver begins a harangue about the supposed iniquities and inferiority's of another ethnic group. Is your best course to keep quiet, bearing in mind that silence conveys assent?  Or is it your moral responsibility to argue with him, to express outrage, even to leave the cab because you know that every silent assent will encourage him next time?  Likewise, if we offer too much silent assent about mysticism and superstition, we abet a general climate in which skepticism is considered impolite,False,

The Anti-Theist’s Tale


There once was a girl named Susie Small

When news was tragic she would pray and stall.

She would pray to her “god” hoping for an answer

But nothing happened; people were still dying of cancer.

She prayed for the starving

She prayed for riches

Nothing came true as she awoke the next day

She had to go to church where she prayed more on Sunday.

Every time she ate dinner she would say grace

She always forgot to thank the cook

She didn’t thank the scientists

Nor did she thank the aliens that gathered the beets.

Oh silly Susie

The doctors fixed her up and gave her ointment for a rash.

When she got home she said thanks to her lord.

She forgot to say thanks to the doctors that worked very hard.

Susan’s church and faith was very peculiar

It was different from other cults that may seem familiar.

Yet they worshipped Yahweh so the government funded them.

Not only had that but Susan given them her life savings.

Giving would generate miracles said the priest

Just use your prayer rug and you will be pleased.

Susan tried but only experienced disappointment

She tried a bit harder; she thought she must be important.

She thought and thought why it wasn’t working

She had a cup she was sipping

Susie grew tired from all of the thinking

She cleaned all the litter boxes because all nine of her cats were stinking.

The next day was a breeze until she saw a commercial

It was quite sad and a little controversial.

It was of children in Africa starving and in need

So she dropped her ice-cream and prayed her creed.

“They need god in their lives.” She thought for their lives to extend

But really they needed food and water

Every day this behavior would repeat

Praying and wishing for something neat.

Some may say she’s wasting her time

I would say she needs to hear about Sagan or Bill Nye.

The sad thing is there’s millions of Susie’s

They only seem to linger and thrive in first world countries.

The moral here is to be skeptical and have health

Thanks for indulging me.

---

I know that people hate Dawkins for a myriad of reasons

So many people seem to interpret ""atheist"" as ""anti-theist""

I am still scared of being too vocal about religion - any religion - because it is so protected (even by law) and people misunderstand the intention behind discussing it casually or openly. People are so caught up in ""respect"" that they sacrifice understanding at the alter of this respect. The fear of blasphemy leads to huge self-censorship and the censorship of others.

Even if I am opposed to faith that doesn't mean that I lack humanity

I picked up my copy of the Quran and started reading it from the beginning. This is from the second ""chapter""; there are a total of 12 verses (lines) from the beginning of the Quran to this part:

&gt;(from 2. Al-Baqarah)

&gt;Indeed

&gt;Allah has set a seal upon their hearts and upon their hearing

&gt;And of the people are some who say

&gt;They [think to] deceive Allah and those who believe

&gt;In their hearts is disease

&gt;And when it is said to them, ""We are but reformers.""

&gt;Unquestionably

------------------

How very useful for a book to start from the beginning by discrediting its opposition as deluded liars with whom you should not engage. And yet it seems to be an odd punishment of a loving God that gave us freedom to increase our disease and give us a painful punishment for our ""lies"".

I'm in agreement with that- private business is private, Jewish group, etc etc etc, that got the discount and the Christian group did not, religious discrimination would be called left and right. I feel that discounts should be given for a proper reason, such as civil service, and not because you believe (or don't believe) in one god over another. 

To draw another obvious parallel, I don't give a fuck- society would flip it's lid. But it's okay to tell people that they are more valuable as customers because of their proclaimed belief in Allah or God or whatever?

Why is there suffering? - Because our society isn't perfect and there is no higher being that prevents suffering

\begin{letter}{International Court of Justice \ Peace Palace \ Carnegieplein 2 \ 2517 KJ The Hague \ The Netherlands}

\opening{Dear Dr. Tomka}

I was recently made aware of the scale of the Catholic sex abuse scandal. Being generally too busy to follow the news in depth I had never before realised the scale of the problem. Rapist priests have been being moved around for decades, while knowing about most of the cases, doing nothing to punish the rapists - some are sent to a clinic for a few weeks perhaps and then moved to a parish were the congregation are unaware of past allegations against the priest in question.

My question to you is this: why has there not been a full investigation into the Vatican and the Catholic church? Since 2001, the most knowledgable person when it comes to the scandal is former Pope Benedict XI. I don't recall him ever informing the police of the names of any priests that deserve to be imprisoned. Thus it would seem that the whole Catholic church from the Vatican down is implicated in the scandal, and those commit child rape and those who protect the rapists from punishment deserve to be brought to justice.

It seems that the church believe their wealth and size can protect them. One recent estimate states that the church have spent \$2 billion on covering up the scandal

I look forward to your reply and any plans you have in tackling the issue.

I won't bother you with my interesting religious/mystical/bizarre/pagan phase/back to hippie phase/agnostic history, cults, culminating with the death of my mother who tortured me psychologically in a psychoesque manner and the recent dissolution of my family.

I begin here as an *Atheist Agnostic*. You will notice that this will gradually change in this very post.

Whenever I got seriously ill, I was desperate and I was like, ""*yeah God, okay, I believe, I believe in the power! Alright mate, you win! I don't want eternal suffering please come on I love you God!!!*""

But that was like a desperate move to get out of a shitty situation, I'd believe in God for a day, back to agnostic but like ""*God help me when I'm in shitty situations*"". When I say believe, it's a very vague and abstract concept, not faith. I don't have that, I never had. Hope is a different thing, though.

So if that is God then whatever it is is an asshole and I want to kill the motherfucker because ""Satan"" would be cooler. Killing him would free society from most

Though in the HBWR trip after I calmed down it was awesome, as I see it, is to advance as a species intellectually, as this is the only thing that makes us unique in any way. We must lose our myths, but we must not distance ourselves from nature - because we need it for our very own survival. We're literally made of nature, earthly and not. We can, should and must evolve alongside nature. I see only **religion** as our *animal nature* which we can and **must lose** as well. That trip was 8 years ago, but it came back with a vengeance.

I am gobsmacked that most people are brainwashed from infancy, and this will always have a sad ending, which is death which frightens most people (not me) the idea of being meaningless and living only once.
Deal with it and let's move on as a species. Religion makes prisoners, a crutch, a social and geopolitical  manipulation tool.

That goes back to primitive humans who had sacrifice and cannibalism in the beginning (we're still having it, and humanity might soon be a thing of the past - and perhaps the entire planet as well.

I mean

Science is our greatest achievement and has been/is actually helping mankind in a multitude of ways.

I'm sure we are intellectually advanced enough to figure out that if that bullshit tactic worked for millenia, crazy authoritarian regimes, really it's all because of those silly lies.

I am becoming quite vocal about my hatred of religion and cults and I can't help it anymore. I say fuck religion, fuck ghosts, let's stop the bullshit. I am not in America but my country has lots of religions and it's fucking insane around here. This area of the city in particular, while diverse in its illusions, is great for money-making charlatans, outspoken religious fanatics, and well

Wait a min

I am sorry for the rant

I have a few questions about anti-theism, I may also be an anti-theist, but as of now I only have a basic understanding and can't really make a claim like that when I don't have all the facts. Without further ado, here I go.

1. Are anti-theists against belief in all Gods, or none of the above?

2. On what grounds do anti-theists oppose religion (and belief in Gods if that's the case

3. From your pretty cool banner, etc.) Does this mean you're rationalists as well?

4. What's the reason for your hard stance against religion

Okay

First off, I do see their beliefs in their Gods or other supernatural beings as irrational, since their beliefs are centered around just that: beliefs. I do also have a distaste for religious institutions. Throughout history (and even recent history to an extent), they have been seen using their beliefs to justify oppression of peoples' rights, hindering the advancement of mankind (especially regarding science) based on their faith, and other things.

Next

I am against superstition as well, peer-reviewed, and valid evidence proving that the existence of spirits contacting people from the grave and haunting places in the real-world. So I can't really say that I actually believe in the paranormal.

The fourth one is for you, I'm just opposed to batshit crazy, unproven, faith and belief-based things get in the way of things in the real world.

&gt;Morality is not innate, unless they were taught. So without religion and the teachings of God we would wander this earth like wolves acting on instinct alone.
&gt;
&gt;The very civilization we live in that has given us the ability to debate this topic was created on the foundation of God. Look at the money we print, and no country can be great with a strong moral foundation which also comes from religion. History speaks for itself! Every great super power on earth has had religion as its foundation. This fact can’t be argued, and the fact so many people want to disprove the idea of religion proves how powerful God is. People spend their entire lives trying to disprove something that cannot be disproven, and yet all I need is faith to confirm my belief. I don’t need experts debating my view or topics in college discussion boards. All I need is the feeling I get when I have God in my life and it’s so powerful, it needs no proof.
&gt;
&gt;Education will continue to try and disprove the teachings of God and the bible; however, I would like to see if they stand by their beliefs, like I will stand by mine.
&gt;
&gt;Will you stand by your beliefs when the time of your death comes?
&gt;
&gt;Would you continue to renounce God if your child was dying?
&gt;
&gt;Would you tell your dying child that no greater place waited for them after death?
&gt;
&gt;How would we evaluate the morality of human actions without God?

The childish question ""why do bad things happen"" i think is simple but brilliant, why does events such as the Cleveland kidnappings happen. The question may seem naive but i see it to be important, if god makes men do good things like charity then he must also be accountable for those three girls going through a 10 year fate that i find unimaginable. If he is so omnipotent then why not help those girls. 

The counter argument is that it is part of a plan. but if God has a plan then everything is predetermined then we have no free will. if everything is set out before us by god (presumably he is the one calling the shots) why set it out so three girls have to undergo three years of rape.

Of course some Christians will say everything is not predetermined and god has no say in the matter of human events

But i can use evidence to prove that the christian teachings show that god has a plan, then he immediately knew everything between then would follow eg. the persecution, the crucifixion.

I have to add after mentioning that point what that entails to Jews. God knew his son would die for our sins (further evidence of things being predetermined) so he knew the Jews would persecute him. From that we can only gather that he is either very bad at setting up scenarios (not very omniscient) or he wanted to exclude the Jews (his chosen people) from being followers of Christ and missing the teachings his son was destined to give.

                         Faith and Fundamentalism

Regardless which moral precepts you pick from the bible there are others who behave so differently it’s almost like they believe in a different god. You know them well, gays, Muslims, or anyone else that is different, and generally protest everything. They are the fundamentalists. They speak the loudest and despite being in the minority hold significant political power and influence many minds. How can these people read the same book you might ask? Despite their appearance they are actually the most rational believers. They take their religion so seriously they will follow it to the t. Why shouldn’t they? They have a book given to them by god himself, the creator of the universe, the highest being in existence. Everything they do should be influenced by Him. They interpret the bible literally because it doesn’t make any sense to them otherwise. “There are no contradictions, and no moral wrong doings. This is Gods’ Holy Word!” Faith comes before any kind of critical thinking for these people. Faith, in large enough doses may not move mountains

Let’s move beyond Christianity and look at the Middle East. What is so different about Islam that suicide bombing seems to pervade constantly? The large majority of Muslims professes no disposition towards violence and will say that the Quran does not either. “It’s the fundamentalists that don’t have the right interpretation!” But let me ask you this: What comes first to you, to fight Satan and his devils! This gives more meaning to my life than anything else!” How could you resist, especially when you have spent your whole life around death and killing. It’s not about what verse says what anymore. You’ve put your faith in more knowledgeable Imams who defend the violence. Nothing can stop you when god is on your side! 

This is what happens with faith: Your interpretation of the world around you doesn’t depend on your internal morals or critical thinking skills; you have rejected all reason and evidence. You created a substitute for reality, to the beginning of life, and even the end of life has an answer that pleases you. It can be a source of great satisfaction if you’re good enough at accepting its’ pleasures, but it is dangerous enough to kill.

I know he also has another organization, the ""National Association for Embryonic Law"", which I'm sure you can guess the intent of. His last post was more obnoxious than usual and I'm rather sick right now and didn't have the strength or patience or frankly the desire to get tough with his arguments. I did post a small response, however. I was wondering if anyone else wanted to ""whack the pinata"" and have a go at the galaxy-sized holes in his arguments. The post in question contains such gems as ""...the first living cell, which no scientist can explain, and Homo Sapiens which turns evolutionary science on its head"". It also has what is essentially a concise summary of his completely unsupported argument that he repeats endlessly regardless of what the actual topic of discussion is:

&gt;There is only on definition of cosmic
&gt;that covers the whole enchillada and that is this:
&gt;
&gt;There is one First Being
&gt;Who of the abundance of His perfection
&gt;exists
&gt;beginning of all.""
&gt;And its corollary:
&gt;
&gt;""God is not confined in time. He is eternala and witout beginning or 
&gt;end. His being is constant
&gt;future. Nothing can be taken away from Him
&gt;name is HE WHO IS. His grandeur exceeds incomparablyl anything

&gt;""This is the earthly goal of man: to evolve his intellectual powers to 
&gt;their fullest; to arrive at a maximum of consciousness; to open tghe 
&gt;eyes of his understanding uopn all things
&gt;his soul

I have a feeling he's drawing upon Aquinas, and yep, the man is quoting Aquinas. His arguments are not only stale; they're not even his.

What really pushed my button was his closing uncharacteristic aggressiveness:

&gt;Unless Atheists can do more than repeat endlessly God is dead and 
&gt;Science says so

&gt;and roses.
&gt;Give me and the world a better explanation for cosmic beginnings 
&gt;that crying in your own cosmic soup or shut up and go home to 
&gt;momma.

I've come to believe that when you get past his prose he's not really saying much of anything, who use their Science as the basis of their atheism. They are using their scientific credibility and their positions as scientists to give validiity to their atheism and that is not only dishonest, but scientifically unethical. "" I politely, respectfully, and very gently tried to discuss (not debate) the Big Questions with him, but I don't see much intellectual honesty on his part.

He wrote the one-star review of Victor Stenger's God: The Failed Hypothesis that this discussion is contained in. I should have realized from the review that Father Stevens is a man who ambles on amusingly and it's only later that you realize he never actually said anything. Maybe someone who's feeling better than I am right now will have the fortitude to try to pin him down on the faults of his arguments.

It was only yesterday that I finally made up my mind on religion... Previously, that's their prerogative. I never really cared to ponder God and what it meant. About a month ago, I broke up with my serious girlfriend and she took it pretty hard. We got along great and are still friends but we just weren't compatible as serious partners. Anyway, the breakup pushed her to get closer to God and now she is completely consumed by religion. I thought maybe it'd be good for her, giver her a source of comfort and make her life more bearable and help her move her life forward. I never really expected these consequences. Her entire philosophy, her perspective on life has actually changed. I don't know how we can stay friends because of this... It's not that I have a problem with God or christianity, more likely it's the radical mentality that makes this impossible. To actually worship a god is such a foreign idea to me. Worshiping anything seems ridiculous. It is a radical departure from reality. I realized last night that this is what religion is. I've never had that frame of reference before

Every element of religion creates such an atmosphere that is so manipulative that it is clear why it exports large amounts of corruption. Further in my study, with its terrifying strategies, makes government and specifically nationalism a religion. I have learned that opinions itself are dangerous and risky, which is why having an opinion on big concepts is so potentially harmful that taking the risk is almost fatal.

In psychology, most humans (Thouless 16-17). Other humans, for some reason, don't acquire that skill, and become highly unsocial, less understandable of emotions, but higher critical thinking and logical reasoning skills. These people, are where we are in

Additionally
In mathematics


Additionally, and therefore will halt our expansion until religion is removed. [^*\[4\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter-gatherer) [^*\[5\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_revolution) [^*\[7\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society#Information_society)

I have also figured something that strengthens my point to anti-theism which is that religion will not slowly go away. True, if you look at the rate of science and the rate of government the point where science educates humanity to think for them self and learn to manage themselves is the point the belief of an higher authority, will truly end. [^*\[2\]*](http://techcrunch.com/2012/04/29/the-future-of-science/) However, this would certainty will not occur until the next 300 years and by then we will have 200 years where society will be halted, which the last time that happened, was the Dark Ages.[^*\[8\]*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Ages_\(historiography\))


Therefore, we need to eliminate those traits (the traditional, rational, affective, and natural elements) that breed religion and then terminate it immediately, for the better if our society. So we know how religion is the wrong answer to life. However, my proposal is not a philosophical but a scientific one. I have clearly shown you how the belief in higher authority is repugnant to society that is a good enough reason to prove to me that religion is not right answer to society and unless you favor strongly in individualism a live you live alone

If you need to understand what those traits specifically are or want to understand the psychology of religion personally you can find some in the sources.

It was not planned that we would come into existence and have superior powers of deductive reasoning than other species. A chance mutation occurred that happened to be beneficial.

1331728444.0,qw2y9,Why there cannot be such a thing as a god (part 1),EchoCompany04,18,4,16,"
This wll obviously be a rant against religion

Before I start
I will be referencing holy books several times, ever.
I attended a protestant elementary school

Fun fact: one-sixth of all American non-religious people are Redditors. 

Every holy book emphasizes the ""fact"" that their god is a kind and peace-loving person.
Then
Wars are raging all over the world
Also
The Beubonic Plague is responsible for whiping out half the European population in the Middle Ages
If god was kind
If he is almighty
And why did he create them in the first place?

Drought
In the Horn
No water means no irrigation
Those people can't grow their own food because of this
Africa, floods, famine, and cannot battle them because they're waist-deep in debt to the West.
Surely any god worth his salt would give these underprivileged lands the resources to climb out of this valley. 

Even we
The recession that started in 2010 hasn't been contained as of yet
Speaking of recessions: the Wall Street crash
If an almighty entity refuses to help us out in times of need, that includes restoring the economy.

More proof that god is a sadist:
Adolf Hitler: 70 million dead
Joseph Stalin: 40 million dead 
Mao Zedong: 60 million dead
Tojo Hirohito: 35 million dead
Wilhelm II: 20 million dead  
Kim Il-Sung: 5 million dead
The Crusades: app. 3 million dead 

Ah
The Crusades were meant to save Jerusalem from the Islam.
There were 7 crusades
 
You believers out there will no doubt blame every problem on the devil.

Is it not true that the bible says: god cast Lucifer down because he didn't agree?
That makes God look like some kind of dictator to me.
And what exactly did Lucifer disagree with? War.
The Devil wanted to end War! And God screwed him over for that.
So I ask you: who is the real villain? 

So according to religion
But the books never speak of the devil as being almighty
If that is true
Because he doesn't exist

God is supposd to have given mankind free will. Many people don't believe in god
Why does he condone people to kill each other over something he himself created?

The reason I have finally decided to not only be anti-theist but anti-spiritual is simply from my observations and experience here. It has made it so clear to me that the delusions of ""higher-powers""  and a ""better-life"" are most often used to perpetuate toxic dependencies. False promises from complete illusions. Magic shows. . .  

Many of the people who live here are very toxic individuals. People who should have been kicked out ages ago stay on because they are higher up on the chain. A lot of people on the lower rung like me are ""lifers"" and they simply cling like tics to the place. They are ""more devoted"" than I.

Many people who have lived in this community have admitted to me they also come from abuse. There are more women here than men. 

Their past and my past have been re-creating themselves in the form of the ""helpless"" and the ""savior."" Except the ""savior"" holds us all on a very tight leash at the same time that we are not safe to express our real feelings and creativity (I.e. my ""ego mind"" creating my ""problems where there is no problems"" by having doubts), they get ""motivational talks"" that are all about ""love, gratitude and surrender"" and they get special treatment. And yet, when you are talking about the people on the inside like me, its a totally different perspective. 

I had always been anti-religion

I happen to be female as well, which is a very very sexist culture!) and their wonderous experiences, powers and rituals, I know he means only men and I cry inside. Only the men have power here. Men chant the goddess name and yet, they can't even take care of their own children properly. 

For example: A new swami moved in recently, the animal would bark furiously and pee on the floor if it were left a minute alone. After a few weeks of walking the dog myself, the dog really liked me, and anytime it found me (even when the swami was around) this creature would run to my feet and sit down. This swami also has two children from another marriage, and having met both of his boys and the mother, all the family members are also very very unwell. By unwell I mean, when THEY had the dog over, got a big suite on the top floor
 
And yet this swami spends hours chanting in his nice double suite. It literally breaks my heart. I can't accept him as a swami, there are worse people who still live here, with even worse drug problems.

I realize this place is a microcosm of the universe, you'll die if you go out there"" if I want to leave and yet when I say something like ""you know that wasn't ok that you told me how I should be living my own spiritual journey. . . "" well I just need to ""surrender"" because this is how the world is.  

I can't argue very well logically yet. I'm still stuck here in this place with very real feelings that this is wrong for me. I know religion is not the fault of people like me who were born into it and followed it out of blind ignorance and hope. I don't hate religious people. I hate the fact that believing in a power outside of yourself makes you open to abuse. And people being people, well watch out. . . there are a lot of snake-salesmen.

I remember reading one time that there is supposed to be a 20% or more percentage of religious clerics who are secretly athiest*. Well

*EDIT: I mean anti-theist. But probably athiest as well (flat out anti-paranormal). I'm sorry

**EDIT 2: Sorry if it seemed like a cry for help! I've been homeless before so I know how to handle really tough situations on my own. Like I said before, it is generally used to keep the people down not uplift them, and this may be one of the most toxic things of all. ""Gas-lighting"" is the word that comes to mind.  Because if you start actually applying yourself to the ""teachings"" of self-understanding, you begin to go in these logical circles with people as they struggle to keep in line with authority, and they will pull the rug out from every effort you make to come to your own understanding.",,False,t5_2qq2r,True

No, and I only bring it up to underscore that we were openly, consciously atheist, overtly unappreciative of religion for the BS it peddles, which is likely how the discussion ended up on religion.

Snippets / memories from my childhood:

At age 5, and being so stubborn that my parents were called after school, and backed me up, whereby I was the kid who didn't have to pray at lunch.

1354380150.0,143vjy,Why hate religion?,TCooper521,51,43,88,"This is my first post on reddit, well-mannered answers. I grew up in a fundamental/traditionalist Christian household. The church I went to it also extremely traditionalists, etc. From the time I was in eighth grade

“If we wish to take scripture seriously and see it as normative
""It is evident in the book Christianity worships that it is the transformative power of God's love
-both of these quotes are from a book by Sallie McFague (Models of God: Theology for an Ecological

Another theologian, but the acceptance of Christianity by all humans. In a sense that the moral teachings of Christianity(specifically Jesus), in their essence, are moral values that promote a general well-being of all of humanity. At that point ""God"" is on earth because Christianity defines God as all that is good, and nothing else. He also denounces Christianity for it's traditions, this isn't a direct quote, but rather from a paper I had to write this semester- ""...traditions and church structures are not only unnecessary but arguably get in the way of what it truly means to be Christian. While Harnack believed that worship is important, they needed to remove their traditions from it. Harnack makes a similar argument in regards to the ""church's authority..."" - basically he thought the modern Christian church was full of hypocritical bigots

Another well known theologian is Immanuel Kant - to sum up his theology (it's similar to Harnack in a sense), in that place, etc etc, compare to long ago, in a galaxy far far away), and most of them that start in that manner offer a unique insight into the human condition, or at least some basic moral lesson to be learned. Kant also proposed universality, don't do anything that you can't know would be O.K. for everyone in the world to do all the time. In that sense he believed that the Bible acted as a moral compass

Given the three I listed (trust me, when looking at Christianity from the view point of well educated theologians (Sallie McFague studied at Yale I believe.. can't remember, but it was an Ivy League, very prestigious school) how can a person be against religion in the sense they portray it. The existence of God, in any sense, is debatable, in many modern theologies he assumes many forms, but the point of these theologies is to create a religion that helps people maintain a high morality, bullshit

Again, most caring people I know. One lady is in her 90's, has been widowed for 50+ years, lives on something like $200 a month, and yet donates to charities regularly, works in the local soup kitchen every week, and helps to stock the local food pantry on a regular basis. So my question is this, what reasoning is there to be against religion

I'm still not sure what I believe, as far as a ""higher power"" I would currently say that I am some form for deist as well(but that's a whole new debate in my mind).

In closing I want to leave you with the strongest argument I have ever heard for religion. It also comes from Sallie McFague, they are not even related. Science is a wonderful thing and gives us an ability to understand the universe we live in to degrees that are almost incomprehensible, and yet it's model is irrelevant to religion. You cannot apply science to human emotions, they can't be validated through science, if science were used to validate art or poetry those things would also be ""wrong"". Art, and poetry, arguably accepted by all as some of the greatest examples of humanity, aren't scientific in any sense. In the same standard religion cannot be validated by science
She words it much more eloquently than I ever could, most promote it, but they find it irrelevant to religious beliefs. They accept that the Bible isn't a history book, but rather a moral guide, written by men, for men, in a manner that made sense in the time it was written. Again back to the first quote I used - “If we wish to take scripture seriously and see it as normative, rather than as the terms in which it is done.”

I doubt many redditor's will read through this entire post, if you pick out one thing, misinterpret it, and try to disprove the whole argument in that manner, I'll only respond asking you to read the whole thing, or telling you you're not any better than the hypocritical traditional Christian. I am pretty open-minded, and do sincerely want to hear opinions about this. I presented an ""argument"" in the form of a question, not because I want an actual argument. I've heard traditionalist Christianities side of the story my whole life, much in the same way a traditional Christian trusts another and ends up believing the earth is 6, so I'm trying to pick the brains of some anti-theists

Edit: I also just noticed the total of three redditors currently on this forum, but thought's on re-posting this in /r/atheism for a wider response?

I got out of college just when the economy crashed. I'm sure many here have experienced the problems described in the most recent issue of Newswseek (http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2012/07/15/are-millennials-the-screwed-generation.html) Upset

Then I saw this: (http://2wanderlust.files.wordpress.com/2012/04/futurism-got-corn-graph-631-thumb.jpg?w=450&amp;h=368)

From the day we were born, and everyone was special. Tyler Durden elaborated upon it:

&gt;*""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy shit we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very pissed off.""*

1342276284.0,wjt08,Doesn't this seem like something that especially applies to religious institutions?  ,flyonawall,13,6,7,"I submitted to r/christianity to see what they would say and hopefully make some of them consider the possibility that it is something they need to address.

However

The article is talking about universities and sports but it all applies to religious institutions too and maybe even more so.  Religious institutions have even more reason to protect themselves at the expense of the individual

To me

http://www.csmonitor.com/Commentary/Opinion/2012/0712/Sandusky-report-Penn-State-the-institution-was-more-important-than-individuals

Edit: 

It seems surprising to me that so many people do not see this as a serious problem and possibly the root of a lot of problems with religious institutions.  Look at how easily they hid child predators and other abuses within the Catholic church.  It happens in other churches too.  I went to my parents church (Reformed Church of America) about abuse I suffered as a mission child and their reaction was not to address it or investigate it

What bothered me most was that they didn't want to hear about it.  They had no interest in investigating it.  They didn't want to know who were the abusers or who were the victims.  They had no questions for me.  I initially got some sympathetic responses, no one would discuss it with me), I was finally responded to and sent the name of a therapist in another state and I think she was going to give me discount, whoop-de-do).  The response of religious people, including my parents, is to protect the church at all costs (they call that the ""greater good"").   

Which means that abuses are routinely swept under the carpet.  So long as they continue to maintain the attitude that the religious institution is more important than the individual

1338918088.0,umdtt,An Anti-Theist Thesis,Itchy_Ike,7,0,2,"This is a position I've never seen articulated in an atheist or anti-theist forum

THESIS: Religion, any belief in the supernatural, like ghosts, etc., is actively hindering human development by keeping us selfish. It is not just foolish and illogical, it is harmful and ultimately destructive.

So, and that's okay. Altruism also preserves life, because without it we would self-destruct as a species. We take care of each other, and that preserves our genes the same way avoiding death does.

Religion (which, it de-emphasizes the importance of the very lives we seek to preserve. I saw a TV show in which a devoutly religious person outright stated, ""I know this world means nothing; it's the one that comes after it that's important."" Because religion keeps people oriented toward their own self-preservation, they are unable to truly view themselves as members of a larger group (the human race). It codifies and solidifies the notion of ""us vs. them,"" giving legitimacy to the base animal aspects of our nature. It makes it nearly impossible to rise above our instincts and act like truly civilized beings.

Altruism in this context is a fundamental sense of membership in a larger group, to look at a chair. What do you see? I'd say 99.999% of respondents would reply, ""A chair."" I, however, see the end result of the efforts of dozens of people: those who harvested the trees, those who cut the trees into lumber, those who shaped the lumber into the chair's components, those who manufactured the screws that hold the chair together, those who shipped the chair to the store, but it's still not complete. And that's how I see EVERYTHING in the world. It's an awe-inspiring

If that type of perception were the norm instead of the exception, prejudice, rape, child abuse, etc. The pain and distress caused by evil actions would have the weight it deserves. We would find it nearly impossible to ignore the suffering of others. We could band together to solve global problems like hunger, poverty, climate change, and its amplification of our selfish nature

This is a complex idea, but I've never really expressed it to this degree. Re-reading it, I can see there are many facets to the concept that I haven't articulated at all, but I don't want this to become an unreadable wall of text. The basic gist is still there.

We all know the bible story
Why was the tree of knowledge of good and evil ever put in the garden?
Why was Eve created so weak she would choose to eat of it?
The same with Adam? If man was really created in Gods image
then why was he not able to overcome a simple temptation to eat of 
the tree? Did God knowingly destine evil to encompass the world?
If so
devil was created by God
why wouldn't or couldn't God have prevented his fall (and mans) 
by his great wisdom?

There is a simple answer
is not 
 perfect; or that He doesn't really exist )

When I was 4 or 5 years old
   .""Why did God make some men evil?""
The first clues to answer the questions for me came from certain 
scriptures. In Gen 3:22 "" ..man has become as one of us..""  I have
to conclude that the ability of man to have true faith, and really
have freedom with creativity and choice he must have a knowledge
of good and evil. If you were like an assimilated robot
even a computer, or ever have 
the real ability to have faith
explains that the creature, not
willingly
be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious
liberty of the children of God. 

Thus although man was created in Gods image
like God until after his fall and his redemption. If you were a robot
be evil or good, because 
you don't have discernment of good and evil. If you can not agree to some absolute 
truths
blinded you to what  really is reality
imaginations There is a certain level of maturity that may need to be reached before you can
effectively judge between all good and evil? In Heb 5:14 the author writes..."".But strong meat
belongs to them that are full of age
to discern both good evil."".


So then, but not willingly.
You must understand the value of the spiritual goes beyond all material existence. So all the evil
that God allows is part of a process to create a greater destiny for man. In Heb 2:8
the author writes ""..You have put all things in subjection under his feet. For in that he put all in
subjection under him
put under him."" Thus there is process not yet completed.

(don't ask me contextual questions,3,0,0,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/qxokd/why_there_is_no_god_part_xii_dont_ask_me/,"  Militant atheists are just as bad as religious ones.

    No

    Atheists are most often called ‘militant’ when they passionately defend reason and advocate critical thinking. The bar theists set for perceived atheist hostility appears to be any atheist simply voicing an opinion in dissent of religious belief. In contrast

    Atheism does not preclude someone from being argumentative or insensitive; those things are simply seen as being preferable to killing one another over an imaginary friend.

    A ‘militant’ atheist will debate in a University theater or appeal for the separation of religion and government. A militant theist will kill doctors, restrict sexual and gender equality and convince children they are flawed and worthless – all under the instruction of their imagined ‘god’ or holy book.

    It can be argued that there is no such thing as a ‘militant’ atheist, then a ‘militant’ atheist is apparently someone who passionately lacks a belief in gods. All other possible beliefs and ideologies – including the desire to oppress theism – come from outside atheism. This is in contrast to religious belief, which often includes a set of laws and commandments purportedly derived from a supernatural source which one can actually be ‘militant’ about.

    Note: ‘Militant’ atheism is most often confused with gosateizm (state atheism)

    “I’m sorry if my insensitivity towards your beliefs offends you. But guess what – your religious wars, inquisitions, censoring of free speech, brainwashing of children, forcing girls into underage marriages, female genital mutilation, stoning, homophobia and rejection of science and reason offend me. So I guess we’re even.” – Anonymous

    Where is god? (Interjection)

    Argument from non-belief.

    Why is it now that we have developed rational inquiry we hear only a deafening silence from a god who once supposedly engaged regularly in human affairs? Why does god not simply speak to us or appear before us as he supposedly used to? Why are we the losers in the dice roll of time? If a god places such a high value on us worshiping and believing then why not simply make its existence obvious to us?

    If one accepts the prevailing scientific understanding of the development of the universe, stars and planets formed. Then it watched with complete and utter indifference as modern Homo Sapians evolved, struggled and died for a further 100,000 years. Finally, a few thousand years ago, this god suddenly decided to reveal itself to several people in the most primitive, illiterate and remote portions of humanity in a completely unverifiable way – and then simply disappeared.

    If Jesus is God then presumably he is omniscient. If this is true, then how exactly was it a sacrifice for him? What did he sacrifice?

    “If Jesus is the son of god, therefore, prayed to himself and begged himself not to require himself be crucified in order to appease himself and save the world from the wrath of himself.” – Anonymous
    Jesus was wholly good and moral.

    Assuming the figure even existed

    “There’s no hell mentioned in the Old Testament. The punishment of the dead is not specified there. It’s only with gentle Jesus
    Atheists are close-minded.

    Being open-minded does not mean accepting claims outright

    Unjustified belief in the supernatural does not automatically make someone open-minded and

    Atheists simply do not usually exhibit gullibility or credulity. They maintain a standard of evidence proportional to the extraordinary nature of certain claims. They are usually open to the idea of god

    “A wise man
    Atheism leads to a worse society.

    I want to go to heaven.

    Argument from wishful thinking. The primary psychological role of traditional religion is deathist rationalization

    See also: Nobody can get into heaven

    “I would love to believe that when I die I will live again, remembering part of me will continue. But much as I want to believe that, and despite the ancient and worldwide cultural traditions that assert an afterlife, I know of nothing to suggest that it is more than wishful thinking. The world is so exquisite with so much love and moral depth, that there is no reason to deceive ourselves with pretty stories for which there’s little good evidence. Far better it seems to me, in our vulnerability, is to look death in the eye and to be grateful every day for the brief but magnificent opportunity that life provides.” – Carl Sagan

    “I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born
    I want to believe in God OR I just have faith.

    There is a truth and reality independent of our desires. Faith simply reinforces your belief in what you would like to be true

    In order to better under understand this reality and discover the truth we must look for evidence outside ourselves.

    Faith isn’t a virtue; it is the glorification of voluntary ignorance.

    “Every atom in your body came from a star that exploded. And, nitrogen, oxygen, iron, all the things that matter for evolution and for life – weren’t created at the beginning of time. They were created in the nuclear furnaces of stars, and the only way for them to get into your body is if those stars were kind enough to explode. So, forget Jesus. The stars died so that you could be today.” – Lawrence Krauss

    Believers claim the victim and imply that non-theists gang up on them, or that the Earth is the center of the universe: delusional.

    The bar theists set for perceived atheist hostility appears to be anyone simply voicing a dissenting opinion or mentioning an inclination towards non-belief. Claiming ‘persecution’ is simply a deflection for theists who are unwilling or unable to deal with open criticism.

    When Atheists aren’t considered the least trustworthy group and comprise more than 70% of the population

    Why can’t atheists just leave theists alone?
        Because religion has been, violence and oppression and discrimination.
        For all the problems we face as a society, usually by supporting irrational political positions eg. stem-cell research, contraception, women’s rights, sexual equality and even global warming.
        Because belief in a god taps into mankind’s natural tendency to defer moral decision making to authority figures (including priests, popes, ayatollahs and imams). Acting out ‘God’s plan’ or ‘God’s will’ is a sure-fire way to absolve one’s-self of responsibility for one’s actions. 
        Because as a functional member of society it benefits everyone if your decision making process is founded on evidence and reason
        Because religious superstition erects an absolute monarchy in a person’s mind. It teaches them to be satisfied with with not understanding the world and represents a surrendering to ignorance under the pretension of ‘divine knowledge’. Many of the greatest thinkers in human history have been repressed, Galileo Galilei, Giordano Bruno, The relationship between science and religion.

    Belief gives life meaning/purpose OR Atheism is nihilistic.

    The question of life’s meaning and purpose is made no less important to an individual by not believing in a god. However, can I give to my life?”.

    Most things in life are worth doing for their own sake, acting charitably, delighting our senses and achieving personal goals all provide an inherit sense of gratification and purpose. Conversely, religion deprives life of any personal meaning by turning it into a form of serfdom, in which our only goal is to appease the whims of a supposed creator and follow its ‘plan’. Any impetus to seek knowledge and explore is removed because all the supposed ‘answers’ are provided.

    Beyond simple biological imperatives life’s purpose is what we make it and nihilism is simply one of many possible approaches. For example, which is fully compatible with atheism, suggests it is to “focus on the human potential to overcome suffering and achieve peacefulness”.

    Perspective is important, stretching back over 4 billion years.

    Science keeps changing

    The suggestion that science is unreliable because it changes is akin to believing new maps are unreliable because cartography is improving.

    Science has demonstrably produced the most accurate and reliable models of the universe that mankind has ever known and it is upon those models that all modern technology

    Science keeps changing because the tools used to perform science keep improving. When the universe of available evidence changes, a theory in science is the highest honor any scientific principle can obtain, for they comprise all the evidence, laws and models relevant to a phenomena. Theories are rarely proven incorrect and are usually refined on a time-scale measured in centuries.

    The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, constantly developing more useful, accurate and comprehensive models and methods, but not necessarily discarding old ones. For example, when Einstein developed the General and Special Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton’s Principia. On the contrary, if the astronomically large, and to Evolution and Genetics.

    Science is an exercise in falsifiability. Unlike religious dogma, an ever sharpening blade.  The models used by science to explain observations and make predictions are simply the ‘most correct’ at the time. The greatest skepticism should always be reserved for inflexible positions whose proponents insist that they and their assertions are above question and examination.

I'm posting here because I don't really have time to think of a response by myself.

Being an ex-muslim

I'm basically trying to explain to them why god doesnt exist. I've secrectly written many commentaries in my spare time on religious books and I sent those to them. Those commentaries are extensive so they haven't really gotten to them yet.

A little backround knowledge. Three of them are doctors, I'm studying to be a chemical engineer at pittsburgh university. Not sure if any of that was important, but its just incase.

Also

ME(Haroon): 
I just got your voicemail and you asked these questions: Why do you have these questions? What is your concept? ( I Assume you mean about the existence of God) What are your feelings? ( I assume you mean about god) What do you think? (I'm going to combine this question with the one above it) Have you studied other books?

First, then you would have to provide evidence. You cannot require the husband to give evidence to prove that he did not kill his wife, that burden of proof is on the accuser. In the same way, everyone is born an atheist and has no religious beliefs. Then religious people make the claim that God exists and then the child has to make a choice. IN the same way, theists have to provide evidence for the existence of God. And there is no proof of God existence, so the claim that theists make about God is invalid. For this reason, no one can ask someone to provide ""proof that god does not exist"" because then would we also have to provide proof that unicorns don't exist? No

The reason I have these questions is because I see no proof in the existence of God. In the same way, because it says so right here on this napkin"". That isnt very credible but that is essentially what the Quran is doing. The quran is saying, ""I'm right because I said so"". If someone published a scientific article about a new discovery and the only proof that they give of this discovery is ""Because I said it was true in the article"" no one would give it another glance. Why do religious people go to their holy books when they are just as invalid? So my feelings about God existing are the same feelings I have with unicorns and fairies. There is no proof of their existence, so why should I believe them? I am searching for the answer, but even a whole book made for the existence of god (""Our God"") I could find very major flaws in all of his arguments. Even being in a very high position on the religious ladder, Hadrat Mirza Bashir Ahmad could not make coherent points.

And yes, then how is it even OPEN to interpretation? In other words, how would anyone mistake the words of God for something else if the book is indeed perfect? All of that proves that the Quran isnt perfect. By that conclusion you come to verse:

[54:18] And indeed We have made the Qur’an easy to understand and to remember. But is there anyone who would receive admonition?

This also not just goes into Arabic. The second line uses the word ""anyone"". So whether you speak english, the Quran and the word of God should be easy to understand. We know now that that particular verse is incorrect because apparently the Quran isn't easy to understand. Then what else might be wrong in the Quran? If the Quran is perfect and easy to understand for everyone, then why are there questions about the Quran? Why do we need commentaries?



USMAN:

Good to hear from you. Hope you are doing well. These are good questions (assuming they are in good faith in an attempt to learn) and we should definitely engage them.
First of all I think we have to address the scope of the problem. I think we have to acknowledge that there is no way to absolutely, then there would be no one who would need convincing. There are many things that are very much suggested like man made climate change but because there is no one test for it, people can dispute it. So all we can do is provide convincing evidence that very strongly indicates the existence of a superior being and take people to that point but the rest is up to them. I think we have to make a distinction between the arguments for the existence of god and the arguments for the veracity of the Quran. We can look at the existence of god with many different arguments - from philosophy (ontologic argument), biology, physics (physics of immortality by tippler).

Richard Dawkins and others have argued that natural selection explains evolution completely but others point to irreducibly complex systems (such as the clotting cascade) that cannot be explained by natural selection. I think the symmetry of the universe is too elegant to be a random phenomenon. Mathematics is said to be the language of the universe and if theory is not elegant

As far as the questions about the Quran go, physics are all independent of the Quran. However it is the moral teaching and the proof of revelation that is perfected in the Quran. Your friend in making a strawman argument - stating incorrectly that we believe a feeble idea that he can then knock down. Khalifa Rabia's book ""Revelation, rationality"" is a an excellent work not because it introduces new arguments but because it shows how the verses in the Quran are applicable to science and predicted events - it offers logical arguments showing the truth of the Quran. As far as ""anyone"" being able to understand it, the phrase ""men of understanding"" is often used to describe those who take heed- this person's arguments strike me as superficial - ask him to be more specific in his critique.

There is much more to say but let's start here.



ASAD:


Hope all is well with you at Pitt. I see that you are keeping yourself busy

This quest of yours could take some time until you are fully convinced and believe in a God. You are very intelligent in your reasoning and logical skills but just keep an open mind as we proceed with this endeavor. Keep searching and if you are sincere in your desire - you will attain it. If you are just trying to play an intellectual game and outsmart the 'ignorant' religious thinkers then it will be a difficult journey.
Let us begin with broadly defining what is meant by God. Let us assume God does exist. What is He or Who is He? I attribute God to be a CONSCIOUS BEING. Would you agree with that assessment? What does the word God represent to you?

What kind of proof would convince you that there might be a God? Are you looking for some scientific proof, something tangible...? I would try to address these general principles first before getting into the Holy Quran and what it says. The Holy Quran itself is a great proof of the existence of God, but NOT because it says so. This could be a discussion in itself at some other time.
One suggestion I would make for you, but please give it a try. What have you got to lose? Every night before you go to sleep, the very last thing you should do is ask Allah or God: People tell me that there is a God. He is the Master of the Universe, Creator of everything, the all Supreme Being. O God, I am in search of You. If You exist help me find You and lead me to You. Provide for me some proof that I know You exist.

""dissent"" with memefication

Due to the selective pressure placed on the memetic populations of the the species ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum*** by Edwards v. Aguillard, was forced to adapt to its more intellectually honest memevironment after the verdict. This resulted in a textbook example of punctuated equilibrium and directional selection within the ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum*** species. 

Memes of ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum*** that were particularly brown with discernible pieces of hay sticking out of its surface were quickly destroyed by the contagious predatory memes produced by the verdict Edwards v. Aguillard due to its obvious nature. This resulted in a massive directional selection in which only the more camouflaged members of ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum*** were able to survive. This segment of the memetic population only represented about 0.0001% of the original population of ***Fundius bullshitus creationsimum***.

 This sub species of memes had been forced to adapt to a much less fertile environment, resulting in directional selection to a less obvious appearance. This subspecies, which has been named ***Fundius bullshitus pseudo intellectualis inertibus*** and ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum fucus*** quickly spread into the memetic niches left after the mass extinction of ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum***. During this transitional phase of its evolution, this memetic population became known colloquially as **Crintelligent Designism**.

This population rapidly multiplied and enjoyed adaptive radiation until a second mass extinction event, that was almost undetectable to ***Scientismum rex*** when placed in Apologia. However, the Bullcovery Group had not counted on the use of sophisticated bologna detection devices, also know as scientifically educated brains, on scrutinizing their new meme. This let to its detection by ***Scientismum rex*** and subsequent predation. ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum fucus*** is now extinct in the wild and can only be found in special meme parks like Conservapedia and in habitats that are particularly free from free thought and reason, like the mind of an evangelical fundy.

**Tl;DR** ***Fundius bullshitus creationismum fucus*** is a critically endangered species.

However, and why they were allowed to do so.

Before Hitler, were the most advanced in terms of industrialization and had a great value for culture and the arts.

The culmination of their success was due to the efforts of one Otto von Bismarck. If you are unfamiliar with the name

Realpolitik is the concept of applying logic to politics in order to understand the true motivations and probabilities of the actions taken by those around you (in a nutshell).

Bismarck was able to use this strategy to guarantee favorable claims of land and power over countries such as France and Russia.

Enter our first great religious catalyst:

The one major flaw to Bismarck's ideology was that he was an undying Royalist

As is the doctrine of royal power

Key differences;

Logic - Bismarck had tactfully chosen his battles and desired to secure a German nation which would develop on it's own as the world watched.

Divinity - Wilhelm figured angels would come down to help with the smiting.

After the great war had subsided, but they went a step further and took away virtually every possible civilian method Germany had that would ensure economic growth and stability (ex- entire merchant fleet = ZERO foreign trade).

In the wake of these actions,000,000,000,000 marks.

Not only did this worsen living conditions, imagine actually having to load an entire wheelbarrow with you hard earned savings in order to afford a single loaf of bread for your family.

Enter catalyst number 2:

Before they were known as the ""Nazi scourge""

For most Germans, and Hitler was the most convincing man for the job.

With his wildly outlandish claims having greater sway over an irrational country than those who preached steady recovery

A persons ability to cultivate logic and practice reason is directly affected by the presence of reasonable circumstance in their everyday life. Religious zealousness is most effective and specifically aimed towards the ignorant

We must give hope where the concept of prosperity is so foreign that faith has become an acceptable substitute.

    Science is an enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe. The main role of observation and experimentation in science is to criticize and refute existing theories. Scientific knowledge is created by asking questions and testing conjectures/hypotheses against reality.

    Faith is absolute trust or confidence in a belief. Scientific theories are, “We are aware that our theories and conclusions are not perfect, just the best fit for available evidence”.

    Scientific knowledge is a form of justified belief grounded in empirical evidence and the demonstrable reliability of the scientific method. Faith is an unjustified belief based on fantasy

    Science converges on the truth via questioning. It’s solutions and explanations do not differ between nations or cultures because they can be tested by anyone, on the other hand, diverges into a myriad of forms and beliefs.

    If all knowledge of science was lost, if every trace of religion were wiped out and nothing were passed on, it would never be created in exactly the same way again.

    If God is the Potter

    Why would a perfect potter create an imperfect mold

    Theistic arguments which assume god’s existence are logically valid.

    Socrates is a cup.

One last thing…

    When I became convinced that the universe was natural, into my soul, into every drop of my blood, the sense, the feeling, the joy of freedom. The walls of my prison crumbled and fell. The dungeon was flooded with light and all the bolts and bars and manacles turned to dust. I was no longer a servant, a serf, not even in infinite space.

    I was free to think. Free to express my thoughts, free to investigate, to guess, and dream and hope. Free to judge and determine for myself. Free to reject all ignorant and cruel creeds, all the inspired books that savages have produced, and the barbarous legends of the past. Free from sanctified mistakes and “holy” lies. Free from the fear of eternal pain, free from the winged monsters of the night. Free from devils

    There were no prohibited places in all of the realm of thought. No error, or utter lying words. I was free; I stood erect and fearlessly, joyously faced all worlds.

    My heart was filled with gratitude, the thinkers who gave their lives for liberty of hand and brain, for the freedom of labor and thought to those who fell on the fierce fields of war. To those who died in dungeons, bound in chains, to those by fire consumed, to all the wise, the good, I vowed to grasp the torch that they held

1331814105.0,qxoiv,Why there is no god PART XI,EchoCompany04,2,2,0,"  Militant atheists are just as bad as religious ones.

    No

    Atheists are most often called ‘militant’ when they passionately defend reason and advocate critical thinking. The bar theists set for perceived atheist hostility appears to be any atheist simply voicing an opinion in dissent of religious belief. In contrast

    Atheism does not preclude someone from being argumentative or insensitive; those things are simply seen as being preferable to killing one another over an imaginary friend.

    A ‘militant’ atheist will debate in a University theater or appeal for the separation of religion and government. A militant theist will kill doctors, restrict sexual and gender equality and convince children they are flawed and worthless – all under the instruction of their imagined ‘god’ or holy book.

    It can be argued that there is no such thing as a ‘militant’ atheist, then a ‘militant’ atheist is apparently someone who passionately lacks a belief in gods. All other possible beliefs and ideologies – including the desire to oppress theism – come from outside atheism. This is in contrast to religious belief, which often includes a set of laws and commandments purportedly derived from a supernatural source which one can actually be ‘militant’ about.

    Note: ‘Militant’ atheism is most often confused with gosateizm (state atheism)

    “I’m sorry if my insensitivity towards your beliefs offends you. But guess what – your religious wars, inquisitions, censoring of free speech, brainwashing of children, forcing girls into underage marriages, female genital mutilation, stoning, homophobia and rejection of science and reason offend me. So I guess we’re even.” – Anonymous

    Where is god? (Interjection)

    Argument from non-belief.

    Why is it now that we have developed rational inquiry we hear only a deafening silence from a god who once supposedly engaged regularly in human affairs? Why does god not simply speak to us or appear before us as he supposedly used to? Why are we the losers in the dice roll of time? If a god places such a high value on us worshiping and believing then why not simply make its existence obvious to us?

    If one accepts the prevailing scientific understanding of the development of the universe, stars and planets formed. Then it watched with complete and utter indifference as modern Homo Sapians evolved, struggled and died for a further 100,000 years. Finally, a few thousand years ago, this god suddenly decided to reveal itself to several people in the most primitive, illiterate and remote portions of humanity in a completely unverifiable way – and then simply disappeared.

    If Jesus is God then presumably he is omniscient. If this is true, then how exactly was it a sacrifice for him? What did he sacrifice?

    “If Jesus is the son of god, therefore, prayed to himself and begged himself not to require himself be crucified in order to appease himself and save the world from the wrath of himself.” – Anonymous
    Jesus was wholly good and moral.

    Assuming the figure even existed

    “There’s no hell mentioned in the Old Testament. The punishment of the dead is not specified there. It’s only with gentle Jesus
    Atheists are close-minded.

    Being open-minded does not mean accepting claims outright

    Unjustified belief in the supernatural does not automatically make someone open-minded and

    Atheists simply do not usually exhibit gullibility or credulity. They maintain a standard of evidence proportional to the extraordinary nature of certain claims. They are usually open to the idea of god

    Atheism leads to a worse society.

    The Argument from Beauty fails to explain why some things are beautiful to some people and not to others

    Human beauty is physical and psychological attractiveness, landscapes and music, are an artefact of culture and the way our brain interprets color, shapes and sound.

    The world is not always beautiful: decay/entropy in physical systems and disease/death among living creatures are natural functions of physics and biology. For example

    The universe is fine-tuned for life.

    The universe is extremely hostile to life. Extinction events on Earth have nearly eliminated complex life on five separate occasions. Of all the species that have ever lived 99.9% are now extinct. Furthermore

    There is nothing to suggest that human life, physical laws and evolution. To believe otherwise amounts to an argument from incredulity and a hubris mix of anthropocentrism and god of the gaps thinking.

    The conditions that we observe, simply seem fine-tuned to us because we evolved to suit them. We cannot prove that all other possible forms of life would be infeasible with a different set of conditions or constants because the only universe that we can observe is the one we occupy. Indeed, modelling  suggests star formation (a necessary precursor to our form of biology) may be viable under a number of different universal conditions.

    Without actual proof of creation, dealt from a shuffled deck, is the one a hypothetical player observes. Though the chances of any one universe being hospitable to life might be low, the conditional probability of a form of life observing a set of constants suitable to it is exactly unity. That is to say, every possible universe would ‘appear’ fine-tuned to the form of life it harbours, while all those inhospitable universes would never be observed at all.

    “The universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the universe.” – Victor Stenger

In fact it fits me staggeringly well, must have been made to have me in it!’ This is such a powerful idea that as the sun rises in the sky and the air heats up and the puddle gets smaller and smaller, it’s still frantically hanging on to the notion that everything’s going to be all right, because this world was meant to have him in it, was built to have him in it; so the moment he disappears catches him rather by surprise.” - Douglas Adams",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Antitheism/comments/qxod1/why_there_is_no_god_part_v/

I guess my personal beliefs can be described as:

I believe everything in the universe comes from a common source. I have no idea what this source is. I feel as though this sort of concept is ineffable and beyond normal human comprehension. But the best analogy I can describe is that this source is like a flashlight and the material world is the light coming from it. Nothing can exist without this source. The material world is imperfect by the very nature of having to be dependent on this source. Growth and decay and so on. I guess I respect that concept. I don't submit to anything in my life but I guess i'm thankful to have been lucky enough to exist. There is no point in having an inflated ego when my reality is so fragile and one of a kind as it is. And so I respect my surroundings and my fellow man. Nature and really the universe as a whole is a beautiful thing and I think existence is a beautiful thing. I don't really believe in Good or evil but I believe in Truth and deception for sure. And the philosophical history of humanity is basically centered around a search for Truth in addition to survival.

I suppose I also subscribe to idealism rather than materialism. I guess the best way I can logically integrate this is when I read up on some aspects of Quantum Mechanics. The theory that everything in our material world is derived from a single infinite wave and so on. But our minds play the most fundamental part in shaping our own personal realities.

But there are so many things that have yet to be discovered. Science can only examine the physical and material world. But everything beyond that isn't something we can examine. Just as our universe came from a singularity we have no idea what was beyond that. That is as nonsensical as talking about an ""outside"" to our universe. But of course it's very possible that there is an ""outside"" to our universe but as of now  those questions are beyond current scientific understanding.

    Agnosticism is the view that the truth value of certain claims is unknown or unknowable. It is a philosophical position not necessarily tied to god’s existence or non-existence. One can be agnostic about any claim. The word originates from the Ancient Greek ἀ- (a-), meaning “knowledge” – “without knowledge”.

    Most atheists, most theists are ‘Gnostic Theists’ – they claim to know with certainty that their particular god exists.

    When most atheists say “God does not exist” they are generally speaking in the same manner as when people say “Leprechauns/Santa Claus/Fairies/Unicorns don’t exist” – those things do not appear exist within contextual reality in which we find ourselves but

    There are, for example:

    What would convince an atheist of a god’s existence?

    A particular standard of evidence is required to prove any claim. This ‘standard’ is adjusted depending upon the nature of the claim. Since god’s existence is an extraordinary claim

    The standard of evidence required to prove a god’s existence is immediately more than any personal anecdote, hysteria or psychosis, ruling out even our own senses as reliable evidence gathering mechanisms in this case. As strange as it sounds, misunderstood aliens might even be attempting to interact with us using extremely advanced technology. In fact, reality itself could be a computer simulation which we unknowingly inhabit.

    Every conceivable argument

    There is, being omnipotent, it would also be able to immediately produce this evidence. If it wanted to, a god could conceivably change the brain chemistry of any individual in order to compel them to believe. It could even restructure the entire universe in such a way as to make non-belief impossible.

    In short

    “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” – Arthur C. Clark

    The world is the way it is. Reality does not bend to our personal whim and facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored. Our personal belief in something does not automatically make it real or true and

    Until we understand something we “do not know”. Positing a ‘god’ in place of admitting personal ignorance is an unfounded leap which demonstrates a fundamental lack of humility.

    The existence and non-existence of a god are not equally probable outcomes. The majority of things we can possibly imagine do not exist. Thus

    “It is far better to grasp the Universe as it really is than to persist in delusion

    “God is an ever-receding pocket of ignorance that’s getting smaller and smaller as time goes on.”- Neil deGrasse Tyson

    There is no evidence god doesn’t exist

    Argument from ignorance.

    A common attempt to shift the burden of proof or ‘make room’ for a god. Represents a type of false dichotomy that excludes the fact that there is insufficient investigation and the proposition has not yet been proven either true or false.

    The failure to disprove the existence of something does not constitute proof of its existence.

    Belief is not as valid a position as skepticism when dealing with unsupported or unfalsifiable claims because all such claims would need to be believed implicitly. Agnostic atheism is the most rational position.


    Atheists should prove god doesn’t exist.

    Russell’s teapot.

    The burden of proof is on the person or party asserting the claim; in this case

    Atheism takes faith / is a religion.

    Calling atheism a religion is like calling bald a hair color

    Atheism is simply a lack of belief in a god or gods, means ‘without – belief in god(s)’. It is, therefore, not a positive belief or a claim to knowledge. Instead, it is the default position of doubt, uncertainty and skepticism one may have regarding claims made by theists. Just as it takes no faith to lack belief or remain uncertain concerning any other imaginable claim, it takes none to doubt the existence of a god or gods. Every human-being ever born begins life as an implicit atheist and must be taught the concept of theism or, indoctrinated with it.

    Atheism has no sacred texts, no rituals or creation stories, no positive beliefs, central tenants, modes of worship or supernatural claims, no implicit or derived moral codes, philosophies or world views and no central organization or church. It fulfills none of the criteria that define a religion. See also: Atheism is a religion.

    Atheists may subscribe to any additional ideologies, Jainism, Universalism, Environmentalism, Pragmatism, Liberalism, Socialism, Conservatism, is an appreciation for secularism, naturalism

 Phenomenon X has a non-physical component.

    Baseless assertion. Unfalsifiable. How can you prove it?

    There have been numerous claims of the supernatural, and people who believe in one form of supernatural or paranormal activity will usually not believe in others due to cognitive bias and wishful thinking.

    Proposing a non-physical explanation for an observed or imagined/fabricated phenomena is not a testable hypothesis and is therefore unworthy of serious consideration. It precludes any deeper insight or understanding and offers no means of distinction from any other possible supernatural claim.

    There are many as yet unexplained phenomena and anomalies in nature. The scientific approach to these is to say “I don’t know yet” and keep on looking

    Note: This claim often represents a deep discomfort with uncertainty or ambiguity

    See also: Critical Thinking (a must watch),  Delusion, Magical Thinking, Superstition, Self-Deception.

    “What can be asserted without proof can be dismissed without proof.” – Christopher Hitchens

    “I don’t feel frightened by not knowing things, and different degrees of certainty about different things, but I’m not absolutely sure of anything. I might think about it a little, but if I can’t figure it out, then I go to something else. It doesn’t frighten me.” – Richard Feynman
    Materialism/Evidentialism/Science cannot recognise supernatural phenomena.

    Distortion of reality. Lack of Critical thinking. The Dragon in my Garage by Carl Sagan. What is real? What constitutes knowledge? Are all supernatural claims implicitly true? Why/Why not?

    A person who disbelieves for poor reasons is no better off than someone who believes for poor reasons. Disbelieving in astrology because a priest tells you to is no better than believing in a god because the same priest tells you to do so.

    Science observes the physical universe, motion, sound, heat, mass or gravity, it becomes a natural phenomena and thus open scientific inquiry. If it does not interact with the physical universe then it cannot be said to exist in any meaningful or perceivable way. Furthermore, when supernatural claims become sufficiently nebulous one may ask if there is any substantive difference between them being true and nothing existing at all.

    Proposing the existence of an entity or phenomena that can never be investigated via empirical

    Relying on supernatural explanations is a cop-out or a dead-end to deepening our understanding of reality. If a natural cause for something is not known

    The Teleological argument , many biological systems have obvious defects consistent with the predictions of evolution by means of natural selection.

    The appearance of complexity and order in the universe is the result of spontaneous self-organization and pattern formation, even life itself, arises from simple, mindless rules repeated over and over again for billions of years. Current scientific theories are able to clearly explain how complexity and order arise in physical systems. Any lack of understanding does not immediately imply ‘god’.

    “The universe is huge and old and rare things happen all the time

    “There is grandeur in this view of life, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.” – Charles Darwin

    God is the universe/love/laws of physics.

    We already have names for these things. Redefining something as ‘god’ tells us nothing. To use the word ‘god’ implies a host of other attributes and if you don’t intend to apply those attributes

    “To call the world God is not to explain it; it is only to enrich our language with a superfluous synonym for the word ‘world’.” – Arthur Schopenhauer
    Science can’t explain X

    God of the gaps. Argument from Ignorance.

    Simply because you or the scientific community lack a complete understanding of something does not imply a theistic explanation carries any value. Even if there exists some topic on which science can never speak

    Lightning, disease, mental illness, speciation, planetary orbits and numerous other phenomena have been historically labeled ‘supernatural’ only to later be more thoroughly and elegantly explained by science. In fact, every mystery ever solved has had non-supernatural explanation. To suggest that science cannot or will not explain a phenomena, and that only theism can

    Using ‘god’ to explain something explains nothing. God’s supposed powers and how they work are a mystery. An explanation is intended to clarify and extend knowledge. Attributing a phenomenon to the magical powers of a supernatural being does neither. Worse still

    Note: By using ‘god’ to fill gaps in their knowledge theists inadvertently provide a shrinking role for their god as science advances. They also predicate god’s existence on a lack of knowledge,False,self,t5_2qq2r,False,,,t3_qxodn
1331813633.0,qxoam,Why there is no god PART IV,EchoCompany04,2,3,0,"  I feel a personal relationship with god OR I ‘experienced’ god.

    Argument from personal experience.

    A result of our naturally evolved neurology

    Humans have evolved a variety of cognitive shortcuts to deal with the mass of information provided by our senses. In particular

    Personal revelation cannot be independently verified. These so-called ‘revelations’ never include information a recipient could not have known beforehand

    Spiritual and religious experiences are not only inconsistent among individuals but are variably attributed to different gods, rituals, hallucinations, meditation etc. The fact that medical conditions and other natural processes [2] can induce these experiences is evidence they are produced by our brain.

    See also: NPR Your brain on god?, The Economist, BBC Doco, PBS Doco and Dawkins on the topic, Deconversion: Personal Relationship (a must watch), TED – How it feels to have a stroke (a must watch) and TED – Ramachandran on your mind.

    “You can tell you’ve created God in your own image when it turns out that God hates all the same people you do.” – Anne Lamott

    People who believe in god are happier.

    The claim that a believer is happier than a skeptic is no more to the point than the fact that a drunken man is happier than a sober one. The happiness of credulity is a cheap and dangerous quality.

    Atheism is correlated with better scientific literacy [2][3], higher average incomes, less violence, lower divorce rates, lower teen pregnancy rates, lower STD infection rates, lower crime rates and lower homicide rates. It correlates highly with the well-being of individuals and societies by almost every possible measure.

    Studies on happiness outside of predominantly religious countries (eg. the United States) find little to no correlation between happiness and religious belief. This corresponds with evidence which shows social and community bonding, by comparison, may also simply be unhappy with the level of distrust and persecution they receive from their compatriots.

Kinship is the basis of human relationships. Without it, the most fundamental unit of primate society, for some ideological reason then you know for certain that it is a mental disease. Know that when you are actively discriminated against for apostasy, the meme in your kin's head is being deleterious and viral. It is forcing them to override their most fundamental instincts to choose incantation and indoctrination than the simple chemical romance that binds us all.

You are not under duress. You cannot be jailed, just walk out. Walk out of faith like it's nobody's business - because it isn't. Raise your apostasy if necessary, or raise it casually when the subject comes up. There is no reason any of us should be ashamed of our apostasy.
