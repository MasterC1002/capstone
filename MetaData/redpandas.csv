However


**Ze Plan**

 * Step 1 - get a list of which zoos have red pandas
 * Step 2 plot them on a map (maybe get redpandanetwork to update theirs?)
 
So, i'll try and start plotting the ones i know about already / can easily find out from zoo's near me. Equally, if you can help with setting up some sort of map that can be worked on to plot their locations, that would be awesome too.
