1342155569.0,whg1n,How to Stay Anonymous - A Guide,darknyan,284,41,124,"Questions on how to stay anonymous are constant

NOTE: This is a bittorrent oriented guide. Some steps could possibly be used for Direct Download but VPN and Guerrilla tactics is the only thing that comes to mind.

NOTE: There is NO way to prevent yourself from being tracked

1) **VPN**

A VPN, is a way of disguising your IP and encrypting all of your internet traffic so your Internet Service Provider and hackers at coffeeshops sniffing data cannot see what you do online. Many people regard VPNs as a excellent, and easy way of protecting yourself, especially on Public Bittorrent sites such as Demonoid.me, ThePirateBay and isoHunt.

In some cases


VPNs will likely be outdated in terms of encryption when IPv6 comes out

A list of VPN providers who ""claim"" to be P2P friendly. They are not required usually

http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/

A Useful guide may be: http://torrentfreak.com/how-to-make-vpns-even-more-secure-120419/

Personally, the VPN could be traced back to you, but that's the same with VPNs that use a dedicated IP address who will cut you off, but using a shared IP address could mean a couple of software conflicts.

_Do not use HideMyAss

_Do not use ProXPN_

VPNReactor is unconfirmed to have logs

*_Do not use TOR or Ultrasurf_*, anonymous free speech and whistleblowing, not so you can download the latest Justin Bieber album.

My condolences to Topiary

*PPTP or OpenVPN?*

Generally PPTP is slightly faster [up to 1.2mbp faster, easier to setup and more compatible with mobile devices such as Android [Android v2 has a bug that disables PPTP without notice though] and iPhone, but OpenVPN has much better encryption, can bypass censorship and is better suited for computers and laptops on the go.
There are other protocols but they are less used. L2TPs Use is dwindling, it is rarely provided with the exception of StrongVPN, which keeps logs.

EDIT: PPTP IS NOT SECURE. [AVOID PPTP](https://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9229757/Tools_released_at_Defcon_can_crack_widely_used_PPTP_encryption_in_under_a_day). In truth


You will likely be caught if you choose a VPN provider that keeps logs and are under constant pressure from Anti-P2P firms.

2) **Seedbox**

Another common suggestion are Seedboxes. Seedboxes are basically machines on high speed connections that can download at speeds of 10mbp, 1Gbit, and up to 10Gbits. These are expensive if you buy dedicated servers, although it is worth knowing that most of these boxes are Kimsufi.ie dedicated servers that are already set up. They don't take much effort to setup though and come with lots of space at a cheap price, also allowing you to setup a OpenVPN if you want at the same price. I recommend going with Kimsufi.ie and setting up your own seedbox if you are up for it, but otherwise, you can cough up the extra 10 dollars and buy from a reputable seedbox provider such as Baconseed.

As a bonus

Guide to setting up your own Seedbox: http://filesharefreak.com/2010/02/13/how-to-install-rtorrent-rutorrent-using-socket-ssl-authentication-on-ubuntu-or-debian

Using a Seedbox provider could

3) **Private Bittorrent Sites**

Exclusive websites such as TorrentLeech (I'm so lucky to have a account.) often are faster, classified documents or police investigation tools.

You do however, a seedbox or a internet connection that is 10mbp or higher is generally required. 

You also need a invite or you need to signup during open registration. /r/trackers 

Some Private Bittorrent sites sell your information

http://torrentfreak.com/filesharing-admin-arrested-for-selling-user-database-120712/

Demonoid (down)

However

4) **Usenet**

If you are willing to pay for a file sharings service on high speed connections that will max out your connection, but this is my opinion and people usually don't like Giganews because it's overpriced. Try astraweb or frugalnews if you are more concerned about price.

There are a couple of Free Usenet providers that are very limited
Zombie_rapist recommends http://just4today.net/ if you would just like to try it out.
Others include http://xsusenet.com/ and http://usenetstorm.com/

I cannot vouch for any of them.

5) **I2P**

In short: I2P is a free, anonymous darknet.

VPNs, but as has been mentioned already, you should not use Tor for filesharing. However, there is another anonymization network that does allow for filesharing. This is I2P. Your data is sent through multiple other computers running I2P (called I2P routers) before it reaches its final destination. Because the information is encrypted from end to end, no one will be able to see what you are sending, nor will they be able to tell what the source of the data or the destination is (a technical explanation of this is beyond to scope of a quick introduction. visit [i2p2.de](http://i2p2.de/) for more information).

I2P already has a small but active torrent scene. At the moment

It should be noted that I2P is considerably slower than clearnet torrents. If you're all about speed

/r/i2p is a good resource to begin exploring I2P. Feel free to post any questions or thoughts you might have about I2P there.

Note: You cannot use I2P to download torrents from the clearnet

Credits: This entire section was written by [ayetoopie](http://www.reddit.com/user/ayetoopie). He was nice enough

6) **Guerrilla tactics**

Downloading using Open Wifi connections

Its possible to be caught if it is a honeypot dropper point

7) **Move to another country.**

A list of countries without copyright laws: Eritrea, US territories [have extradition with the US] Seychelles, Iran, Iraq, Palau, Afghanistan [for a few more months] Somalia, Kiribati, Sao Tome, and Nauru. If you decide to leave for Laos or Somalia

Some countries where piracy is on a wide scale don't care either. Generally countries such as China

8) **Using a anonymous bittorrent service** 

Services such as OneSwarm, which is a anonymous network, but I have no experience so I cannot vouch.

9) **Software such as Peerblock and PeerGuardian**

 These software privacy oriented firewalls are useless for keeping your IP address from evil people, e.g. You share a apartment with 3 different people, each with their own computer. Crucial Information such as Operating System, Time of Access, Ping, e.g. can allow this, but usually the owner of the connection or home is sued.

*Note: They don't offer protection

10) **Stop pirating -_-**

Piracy is bad

If you live in a country that allows you to express your opinion/democracy, vote for the Pirate Party, or run as a politician for the Pirate Party :)

3. Avoid the most popular torrents. It's tempting to pick the most popular torrent on ThePirateBay because you think it will download faster. But the more popular a torrent is, they might get 100 replies, and out of that they might find 2 people willing to cough up money. Their real goal is to scare as many people as possible with the emails, but they still gotta pay the bills (they usually hire crappy little firms to do this ""anti-piracy"" work for them).

4. If you can afford it, and you won't even need to worry about the above 3 guidelines.

Recently online, torrents are stealing, etc.

I am sure this is partially people not taking the time to word things properly

This is like saying ""Wow, because it's associated with copyrighted content. Of course this doesn't happen with YouTube but it does with torrents and it's illogical. Torrents are helpful for people who offer free services. People who offer free games, Linux distros or other software online typically offer torrent downloads because it saves bandwidth and saves on server resources.

I know many of you guys have been unable to satisfy your sharing addiction with the latest ddos of demonoid.  So I've decided to compile a list of private trackers with open registration so everyone can try to get their fix.

Note: These are open at the time of this post

RuTracker - Ratioless

TorrentShack - gazelle powered, p2p

DTN - ratioless

Libble - gazelle powered

TheBox - british media

TheEmpire - Canadian TV and content

Deviloid - pr0n

Empornium - pr0n

GayTorrents - Gay Porn

ILT - scene

Speed dot CD - scene

undergroundgamer - retro gaming

TZT - general

AnimeTorrents - Anime



**Trackers with Applications and/or Interviews**

What [Interview](http://www.whatinterviewprep.com/) - gazelle powered

HD-Bits - HD Content

TorrentDamage - General

**For Textbooks and elearning**

Please look [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/hrgmv/tracker_with_pdfsebooks_of_college_textbooks/c1xrq44)

**Open Trackers Listings**

IMO, go for it

http://opentrackers.net/

http://btracs.com/

**Reddit's Consolidated Invite Thread**

Before even thinking about posting in the consolidated invite thread

1. Read the original post, he/they may mark your reddit account and watch it closely.  And yes, they are all over this subreddit, /r/trackers, and /r/invites.

2. Make sure your proofs are legitimate.  Everybody has their own subjective opinion of what a ""legit"" proof is

3. **Demonoid Only Users, and seeding there is very easy.  I made this thread to help users out, not to argue the legitimacy of demonoid, so please do not post arguments regarding demonoid's ""legitimacy.""  Proofs from there mean nothing in the consolidated invite thread

4. Understand that inviters are responsible for invitees

the thread is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/comments/x415a/what_time_is_it_new_consolidated_invite_thread/?sort=new)

**closing notes**

Remember to read the rules and faqs of each tracker

Use reddit's search function and sidebar information.  They are great resources.

I read your article about VPNs http://torrentfreak.com/vpn-services-that-take-your-anonymity-seriously-2013-edition-130302/. I tried out btguard for a month and stopped using it. Tonight I decided to give it another go and I realized I forgot my login name, meaning they store PWs in plain text and don't hash them. I feel like this is a no no for security, especially for a company who is supposed to be providing a secure service. I think this is a particularly poor move on their part and I wont be renewing my service with them. I feel as if this should be something you warn readers about, giving that you have recommended them in two articles about VPN services, the aforementioned one and http://torrentfreak.com/which-vpn-providers-really-take-anonymity-seriously-111007/.

image of email I got after requesting my forgotten pw after changing it to something more appropriate http://i.imgur.com/vk7MX9G.png. I've changed it again hopefully they don't keep a log of prior passwords.

I deleted my original submission of this post because I had a typo in the title.

edit- response from torrent freak


Hi

Thanks for your email and the information on BTGuard.

The article we wrote doesn't try to assess anything else other than the anonymity offered by any of the providers from a logging standpoint and inclusion on the list is not necessarily an endorsement from us.

That said

Again

Cheers!

* Inline file priority adjustment
* Configurable speed settings
* Encrypted torrenting
* Prioritize torrents for streaming
* Seeding goals
* RSS feed support
* Match feeds with regex and automatically download
* Browse feeds from the application and add torrents directly

I'd appreciate all the help I can get hunting down bugs and getting feedback on the client. If you're up for trying it

If you continue to use public trackers you WILL get cease and desist letters from your ISP.

Get on a private tracker. yes, make the effort to get an invite.

The thing about private trackers is that invites tend to snowball. Once you are in good standing on one site, getting onto the first one is the hard part). Most of the larger sites have an IRC channel specifically for invites. With a little bit of torrenting knowledge you can easily earn an invite.

If you need more a reason (other than freedom from ISP letters) to use private trackers, viruses, etc. etc. If a user is found to have knowingly uploaded malware, they can't be ""banned"" since invites are open to anyone.

Whereas private trackers check nearly every torrent, but any other sites they have connections to.

Suggestions to fight this?,grumby24,41,15,23,"My buddy has received a letter from his ISP which originally came from a court order originated by some law firm looking for his personal information.  They are looking for compensation for someone downloading a movie from his IP address. It is demanding a sum of money to settle.  He has either gotten it down to $3k or believes that is what it will cost to settle.

He doesn't think he actually downloaded the movie in question.  He moved and rented his place out to other people around that time but kept the cable contract in his name so he thinks he is liable either way given that he ""authorized"" the renters to use his internet connection.

The letter went to his old address so he didn't get it until the period to contest (as given in the letter) was over.  

He obviously doesn't want to have to pay for something that he didn't do

EDIT:
His ISP is Comcast and they contacted him with a subpoena for deposition

So now he is expecting a settlement letter from the law firm for $1-3k

My isp has had some serious SS-style throttling tactics for awhile now and I'm sick of it. I'm fairly certain they are using Sandvine throttling, only to be ""noticed"" and clipped back to under 10kB/s.

However

It showed tons of peers in the blizz downloader

I think people must have complained about blizzard downloads/gameplay being affected by the throttling and my ISP added it to some sort of exclusion list.

Which brings me to my question:

How are torrent data packets structured... and how do I go about writing a program that masks all torrent data as blizzard data?

**Update:** Thanks for the responses so far.  I just wanted to add that I have been looking into this further and it appears that .edu s are also ""whitelisted"" for both UP and DOWN stream with my ISP.  This is making me believe it could also be IP based exclusions, Etc.).

**Update 2** Just to be clear, but I am not satisfied with my ISPs idea of service and do not feel I should be forced to pay extra for their convenience and bottomline (lower network loads).

**Update 3** Thanks to another Redditors' shared curiousity, new avg = 160 kb/s peaking @ 800kb/s.  Hope this also helps some of you.",,False,,t5_2qh0w,True,,

1330992553.0,qjc8t,Anonymous torrenting (calling network nerds),funk_monk,29,7,15,"Ok

What I propose is something akin to the tor network. Trackers are distributed as with tribbler, who then says ""yes, I know where this is and I'll get it for you"". You would then set up an SSL connection with that peer. The peer then asks a seed for the data, and then sets up an SSL connection with the seed using a different key. Packet requests and replies can be delayed a few minutes, obviously increasing latency, but having no impact on overall download rates (I'll explain why this is used later).

The beauty behind this is as follows

* Unless someone is snooping in as a middle node, since the chance of both sniffing in is incredibly slim (though this would have the downside of increasing bandwidth use, something of a problem anyway since it's already doubled).
* Deep packet inspection would have no effect since the packets being sent between a seed to a middle node
* Due to the random delay added
* In doing these things

The only problem I can see is how to seed anonymously, the new proposed files would simply include an identifier. When you initially send out a request for the file, you broadcast this to possibly 1000 different nodes in the network. Each of those nodes could possibly also be a seed for the torrent, or know someone else who is. Once a seed is found, the existing connection with the current nodes is seen as ""preferred"". That way it would be difficult to differentiate a seed from a node since being a persistent connection is no longer identifying as a seed. This way seeds need not actively broadcast what they contain, and could just as easily be mistaken for a node. Over time, a loose database is built up of who knows who

* computer A sends out a request to computer B
* computer B says ""yes I have access to this data""
* it is un-knowable whether B is actually a seed
* B could even say ""yes, with the above rule still applying

If things are to be implemented as above, then the bandwidth use would be stupidly high. However, the timeout would have to be random, otherwise it may be possible to trace. For example, there is a maximum ""bounce"" depth of 2 (that's the best term I could think of), each time a new node is accessed, the bounce depth is either incremented or decremented, or provide insight into a better solution if you know one.

However this solution should guarantee anonymity to people merely downloading. The only way to stop it would be to simply ban SSL connections outright since there would be no way of knowing whether the connection was carrying the torrenting protocol or merely an encrypted video feed.

EDIT: I've thought of an additional layer of protection (it was pretty obvious really, the details would just be forwarded by a node. This way a node would have no way of snooping in, meaning that only one node is strictly necessary. Basically we have three computers, A, B and C. B is the middle node. A connection is established from A to C through B. A and C then agree on a key to use. C (the seed) then encrypts all data going out first with the key between it and A and then with the key going to B, thus meaning that B would still be left with an encrypted bunch of data even if he tried to snoop in since B is not aware of the key between A and C.",,,,

I make math education videos and once I have a whole bunch I release them as torrents. I already have 4 torrents out there and have enough to create set number 5. My issue is this:

For this set I bought an HD camera and have been uploading the vids to youtube at **1280 x 720**. The files are **wmv**. Now if i try to create a torrent with the files as they are then the torrent will be huge - **26 videos

So my question is this: What video format should I convert these to to reduce the size of the files

Also I'm **using a PC** *(Microsoft)*. 

Any advice greatly appreciated. 

Thanks. 

**Edit1:** The files vary between **200

**Edit2:** So I downloaded Handbrake as per the recommendations. Awesome software

**Edit3:** I converted the 1 gig file to MKV as well and it's also around 400
