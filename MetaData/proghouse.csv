Since we've been getting bombarded with commercialized electronic music labeled as progressive house I thought I should share some of my thoughts. Moderators 

I've waiting for more than 4 years for music stores to fix this issue but they haven't

Everyday I remove two or three new tracks and we only get few submissions here. It just feels like censorship now.

Who am I to tell others that a track is not progressive house

For the sake of growth of this subreddit based on what the users feel I would no longer feel like I should moderate it the way I do now.

I will mainly focus on spam and the spamfilter and intervene when the users want me to.

I've noticed a trend that users here are downvoting real progressive house and upvoting the commercialized progressive house.

So I've opened up a new subreddit called /r/realproghouse with an actual objective of bringing progressive house lovers together

I'm just tired

You humble moderator

I know that people here (myself included) can get a little touchy when people refer to Swedish House Mafia as progressive house.  I know that Avicii-like posts are not permitted.  And so I wonder what the general consensus is about Mr Prydz.  I think his music is significantly better than the aforementioned acts however I think they have some significant elements in common.  I am no musical expert and I always have trouble describing music so for me the similarities are more about the *feel* of the songs.

So I'm gonna give you a wide variety of different types of house

First, Michael Cassette and EDX... a bit more ""chill"" than some of the famous deadmau5 tracks. Not as pronounced in terms of huge bass kicks and wild synths, these artists generally have more instrumentality to their tracks; not necessarily more ""musical"", but definitely a lot more to their tracks then just a bass kick and a fat synth lead.

Mango's [Here We Go](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_4x0OedR54) is one of my favorite. Perfect for a beach day. Not super in your face with a great sweeping melody and the bassline is deep but not overwhelming.

Speaking of beach days


I've been loving Michael Cassettes latest track, is a gold mine for tracks like this. I absolutely love the piano, and this record is like a blend of a great piano riff and a hard hitting bass line. Been on repeat for me the last couple of weeks.


EDX at the moment is one of my favorite artists all around. He's got great versatility, EDX is excellent and has an expansive discography as well. 


Moving on. Since you came here looking for deadmau5 type stuff

You want some stuff with lyrics? [Somewhere](http://vimeo.com/16021021) by DJ Mog is a great track, and the remix of [Rose of Jericho](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fLKshWcnVus) by BT is legendary. Their track [Twilight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2cAv-rN0nt8) is also great. [Aquila](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3T7PuQ3wMU) by Atlantis Ocean is also one of my favorite tracks of the last year or two. Great melody, fantastic production. [Chris Reece](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LBJbGqaIYGo) also has some great tracks.

There's some more ""trancey-sounding"" stuff which i love as well. Mat Zo is absolutely my favorite artist in this category right now. You've definitely heard [Rebound](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXQhVmnNmxk) and probably [Mozart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwLzZoB6y8A) which are both spectacular, [It's Yours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KouVJTRBBIs). Check out AnjunaBeats and Anjunadeep for a ton more stuff like this. Also look into Jaytech, Oliver Smith, Andrew Bayer, Above and Beyond and Suspect 44. All of these artists deserve a look into.

Getting into a bit more of the mainstream
There's also the obvious names: Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, etc are are obligatory, but definitely firmly in the mainstream

Pryda and Eric Prydz (same person) are two legendary names. I could spend 15 minutes typing out all the classics they've produced, and a combination of simple harmonies with complex instrumentation.

I'll go ahead and nominate one of the most obvious candidates: Jaytech. Though his releases sometimes fall more within the bounds of progressive trance, featuring great tracks such as [Dr. Device](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtRSoeMsT_I), a rework of [New Vibe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tp61167gwLg) and the title track [Multiverse](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i3SeIbPL8Gc).

He also worked on ANJUNADEEP04 with James Grant

This brings me to his monthly podcast

Whilst he supports Above &amp; Beyond, closing his set with one of my favourite tracks [David Akermanis - Aura (G-tek Remix)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=afndcDGPalk).

Over the last couple years I've been to more live shows than I can count.  Trance, electro, tech house; I've been to a lot.  I know we're all about ""support the artist"" here and so hear me out.  I pirate music.  I can tell you with certainty that in the last few years I have paid for an MP3 only once and it was in order to list myself in a raffle.  I didnt even really like the music I bought but I did like the prize.

I go to shows to support the artist.  I have upwards of 2000 tracks on my computer.  At the regular prices I see on Beatport and elsewhere I cannot afford that.  And so I download the tracks illegally.  Yes

I lived in Orlando for a while and shows there RARELY cost more than $35.  I saw Prok &amp; Fitch (and quite a few others) for $10.  I can afford this.  I currently have 3 Prok &amp; Fitch tracks on my computer and have listened to some sets of theirs on Soundcloud.  I think the $10 is a fair exchange.  I own ZERO Skrillex tracks though I did pay a lot of money to go to Ultra and I did see him at a local club for around $40.

My point is that I cant afford what it costs for me to enjoy the music I like on a regular basis and so when I can I go out of my way to pay to see someone live.  They came to my town to do a live performance and I've pirated their music and so to me it is only fair that I pay the fee to go support their music.

I understand that some may think this may not be totally fair to the artist.  If I could I would purchase every track I have on my computer because I love all of them.  To me each one is worth the .99 or 1.99 or whatever it costs on different sites but I dont have that much money.  It is important (to me at least) to note that I didn't come up with this justification on my own.  A few years ago I heard a piece on NPR about a band in Brazil that flies private jets across the country to do concerts (all of which are sold out).  They do not sell any CDs.  In anticipation of a concert they distribute CDs for free to local people in the city in which they are about the perform.  As a result they make all of there money (which is considerable) from live performances.  I have this in mind every time I purchase a ticket to a live show.

If you pirate music please,False,self,t5_2s5of,False,,,t3_16d6lp
