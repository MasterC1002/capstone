I live in New York, which for $75 a month, gave us...the same crappy speeds. Since November,  when we upgraded, service has been intermittent and generally lousy. When I called to talk to TWC reps (repeatedly), they were nice...but not willing to do anything other than ""wait it out."" There were occasional service visits that resulted in no fixes (and one specific instance where the guy was ""missing"" for a while and showed up 6 hours late).

Further

**Today

* Go look up the website of your local Public Service Commission. For NY
* Fill out a complaint form. Provide specific information and examples if you have them.
* Immediately after doing this

Not only do you get to talk to the supervisor who is willing to help, and be on their best behavior until the ticket is closed.

In my case, and since November, that's 6 months of ""that service."" I asked to be credited with the difference in the bill ($60) for each month.

1329810374.0,pz2pb,How to browse the Deepweb (aka Tor),torthor,445,69,122,"Over the course of the past few years, and it truly is a unique and intriguing place. I'll outline the steps to get started:

Download the [Tor Browser Bundle](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en). This package contains everything you need to run Tor on your machine.

 * Windows: Unzip the file
 * Linux: Untar the file
 * OSX: Just run `TorBrowser_en-US.app`

At this point, feel free to just browse the regular internet anonymously - however that is just scratching the surface of the Deepweb. There is a lot more out there on ""Hidden Web Sites"".

A Hidden Web Site is any site that has a domain name that ends in "".onion"". These sites are different than regular websites

Because there is no central registrar

 * [The Hidden Wiki](http://kpvz7ki2v5agwt35.onion/wiki/index.php/Main_Page) - An excellent landing page to the onionland. There are many useful links here - but be wary: there are also links to scam sites.
 * [The Silk Road](http://silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/) - I'm sure you've heard of it before - the place where you can buy many black market substances using Bitcoins. Even if you don't plan to buy anything
 * [WikiLeaks](http://zbnnr7qzaxlk5tms.onion/) - A clone of wikileaks.
 * [RedditTor](http://k6gsb4ibatcico35.onion/) - A clone of reddit that is running in onionland. Yay open source!

Many people compare the Deepweb to the internet before AOL. It is much less populated - but the population is generally more technically savvy. You also have to watch out for scams and fraud - there is no regulation - so keep your wits about you.

This is part 2 of 3 that I have for helping redditors with jobs/resumees/interviews.  All the nuts and bolts are in the first [post](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/q8bu6/how_to_get_a_job_1_of_3_the_postingresume/)

I've broken it up into 3 bits

1.  [The posting/resume](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/q8bu6/how_to_get_a_job_1_of_3_the_postingresume/)  
2.  [Before the interview](http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/qijna/how_to_get_a_job_2_of_3_before_the_interview/)  
3.  **The interview and afterwards**  

This is the most stressful part of the process, and has done more than her fair share of hiring.  


**The interview and afterwards**  

 - **PHONE.  OFF.**  
 - Be up front with what you can and can't do. If you say you're a Linux god, they may be willing to look past it and give you some on the job training (unless, of course you're applying to be a Linux admin).  
 - Bring a notebook/pad of paper and a pen to make notes: FIRST NOTE: Names of the interviewers. Now you can look down, because you remembered her.  
 - Bring 3-4 copies of your resume to the interview
 - Use one of the resume copies to follow along with the interviewer in case they want to go through it line by line  
 - For your ""makes you look good"" story
 - When a question is asked
 - You know that thing you're awesome at? You're awesome at it because you do it all the time; the thing you suck at you never do. So get someone to ask you some interview questions and practice
 - Clean yourself up. Make sure you're dressed for the part.  Wear a clean, 49 hours growth isn't) and sit up straight. Do that and you're better than 2/3 of people who apply for entry level positions (even in ""professional offices"".)  
 - Pay attention
 - You will probably get asked *How much do you expect to make?*  **Don't push this back on the interviewer.**  They asked because they want an answer, so so some research into the position/sallary range, have a a good answer ready.  
 - If you are already employed
 - Make sure to ask when they expect to make a decision
 - And finally

**After the interview**

 - Send a followup email. Just something along the lines of ""Thanks for your time
 - If you didn't get the job, and I called the other guy to ask if he was still interested (he was).  If he had whined or bitched I wouldn't have.  

Best of Luck.",self,t5_2qh69,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/qstvr/how_to_get_a_job_3_of_3_the_interview/

1328375038.0,par8f,"Why you should (and how to) taste a bottle of wine in a restaurant.
",85,86,http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/par8f/why_you_should_and_how_to_taste_a_bottle_of_wine/,"I thought I'd jump on this one as I just got home from work at a restaurant where this has been an ongoing topic of discussion. When the restaurant first opened, all bottles of wine ordered were opened by the bartender or wine director and checked to make sure they were good before taking to the table. The reasoning behind this was, the owners of the restaurant knew that not everyone was comfortable with the ceremony of checking a bottle and they wanted to create a casual atmosphere while at the same time ensuring that people were getting a good bottle of wine. (There's nothing worse than opening a bottle at a table, but having the person tasting approve it because they don't know what they're doing.)

So here's my two cents

You taste wine at the table to make sure that it's ""good"". For those of us less sophisticated oneophiles, it's pretty obvious. This is different from smelling ferrous, or earthy. It's a very off-putting smell and once you've smelled it, you don't forget it. You are not tasting / smelling the wine to make sure that you like it. If you have ordered the bottle and the bottle of wine is not defective (eg: corked) you are expected to accept the bottle. The understanding here being: you either know what you're ordering or, if you know nothing about wine, there is someone you can ask for guidance (the server or sommelier). If you detect a defect that is not cork, chances are you don't need to read this post.

If the list is unfamiliar to you or if you just don't know a lot about wine

Red or white? (Obvious)

Do you want something full-bodied, you may have a preference - lighter wines tend to pair better with lighter, or leaner fare. Fuller bodied wines tend to pair better with heavier, oftentimes, meatier fare.)

Do you want something brighter or rounder? (Brightness usually refers to acidity. Acidity develops in regions that have cold nights. That's why wines from northern regions typically have higher levels of acidity than wines from warmer, acidity can be a great complement to rich, fatty foods, as the acid in the wine helps cut through the fat. High acid wines are also a great compliment to seafood and citrus.)

Do you want something dry or fruity? (Dry denotes tannins. An extremely tannic wine will make your mouth feel dry or gritty when you drink it. I think these wines are best had with food - they're not often casual sipping wines. Wines that are more ""fruit-forward"" will generally be softer, and sometimes, with a bit of perceived sweetness.)

Other things to keep in mind:

The language of wine is complex. It might sound like bullshit if you're just getting started, chances are, a wine from that region will compliment it well! Sometimes the way a wine smells and looks will be very different from how it tastes. Most of the time, smell and look can provide you with important clues about taste.

You will come to differentiate fruit profiles (fresh bright red fruits like pomegranate or cranberry / red cherry / black cherry / plum / brambleberry: blackberry, peach / citrus like lemon, lime, lemon zest, grapefruit, orange peel / orchard fruits like apple - red,yellow, pear / melons / tropical fruits like guava

And other flavor profiles you might consider: For whites (grassy, hay, petrol, oyster shell, sea salt, white flowers). For reds (iron, blood, tobacco, roses, volcanic

There's a difference between ripe fruit flavors and secondary (or baked / stewed / dried) fruit flavors. Some wines are spicy - either hot like cinnamon red hots or warm like cardamom

Some wines taste great paired with some foods and awful paired with others. A good rule of thumb is to choose a wine with flavor profiles that are either consistent with what you are eating, saucy meat dishes.

Now

First step: LOOK at the wine.

Hold your glass at an angle (over a white tablecloth or paper will help) and look at the color of the wine. This will give you an indication of its age, if lighter, pomegranate or cranberry. For whites, very pale wines will tend to be lean, higher in acidity, more citrus-y while more golden colored wines will tend to be rounder, fattier

Next Step: SMELL the wine

This will, cork is a terrible smell. Your wine should be pleasant smelling - that could mean anything from incense to dried flowers to grass to plums to tobacco to leather. It should not smell rotten. If you are drinking a still wine, swirl it briefly and tilt the glass to the side as you sniff it. Never swirl a sparkling wine, silly!!!!

Final Step: TASTE the wine.

Oh boy, if the bottle is good and you're with good friends having good food, you win. And if you pay attention to what you're drinking, maybe you will make a more informed choice next time. Or maybe you love it! Congrats! It's just wine, afterall, not rocket science!

The last thing I have to say about tasting wine in a restaurant: Don't be an asshole. The classiest way to taste is to swirl and sniff and give the nod of approval (provided the wine is ok.) Save the full on examination for after you've given the thumbs up that the bottle is good.

Some people take wine way too seriously. Wine is meant to be enjoyed. If you're not having a good time

Best to everyone in their explorations of wine and please

1. [Go here](http://www.jshine.net/astronomy/dark_sky/). The colours are based on the [Bortle Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bortle_Dark-Sky_Scale) for sky brightness/light polution. Find where you live and locate the nearest patch of land that has either a blue, but when I went to a green area on a clear night I wasn't able to see the milky way.

2. Having located where you are going to go, particles in the atmosphere and ""seeing"" ability, you can tell when the absolute best time of the best day would be. Dark blue across all of the top three markers is the absolute ideal stargazing situation, but even a standard blue or two or a teal is okay.

As an example: say you lived in Syracuse. Well, ideally near Raquette Lake. Looks like there's a campground in the area, so maybe you can make a weekend of it. [As per wiki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raquette_Lake), the coordinates are 43°50′N 74°39′W. 

Now we head over to the second page and pop the coordinates into the pink box. Looks like the [Wakely Mountain location is pretty close](http://cleardarksky.com/cgi-bin/find_chart.py?type=llmap&amp;Mn=astronomy&amp;olat=&amp;olong=&amp;olatd=43&amp;olatm=50&amp;olongd=74&amp;olongm=39&amp;unit=1), we click that one and it brings us to the page for this specific site so that we can take a look at the characteristics of the sky for the next few days.

Now you can see why a couple of lighter coloured squares is detrimental in the descriptions of ""Cloud Cover, so you probably don't need to worry about [""Seeing""](http://weather.gc.ca/astro/seeing_e.html) as long as it's not going to be terrible.

- Made from recycled material

- Light weight compared to the real stuff

- Looks just as cool 

- Can be designed to fit perfectly

Disadvantages

- Will not save your life in battle 

This is what I made:  http://i.imgur.com/ZBIJz.jpg
	


What you will need:

•	Large amount of tabs (amount depends on the size of the project)

•	Several spools of 5/8” ribbon. You could also use thick yarn or strips of fabric (color of your choice)

•	Scissors

•	Needle nose pliers

•	Any kind of tape


1.	First you need to collect the tabs

2.	Please don’t skip this step!!! You need to wash the tabs! If you do not wash the tabs they will eventually grow mold from left over beer and pop all over them.  I just put the tabs in a strainer and used dish soap to clean them which worked just fine. Let the tabs air dry completely.

3.	You also need to clean up the sharp edges of the tabs that look like this:  http://imgur.com/hTQzM.jpg 
(To do this I use needle nose pliers and flatten down the sharp part) 

4.	Measure your yarn or ribbon to be about ½ the length longer than the pattern:  http://imgur.com/86fFo.jpg 
(I don’t really have a pattern for the tab armor that I made but you can easily make your own pattern by using clothes that you already have)

5.	Tape the end of the ribbon or yarn to make it easier to thread through the tabs: http://imgur.com/POWiX.jpg 

6.	Complete one “stitch” :
•	Take 3 tabs and hold them like this:   http://imgur.com/0TkdF.jpg        
•	Then take your ribbon and pull it up through the bottom like this (pull it almost to the end of the ribbon leaving about 2 inches at the end):   http://imgur.com/7fr15.jpg              
•	Then pull your ribbon down through the top like this:  http://imgur.com/DMxqi.jpg 

7.	Now repeat step 6 by adding one tab at a time and continue weaving in and out like this: http://imgur.com/PlA2l.jpg 

8.	Once you have created two long strips of tabs
Or you can stitch them together like this which will allow it to move more and will be more comfortable for something like a skirt: http://i.imgur.com/NuF7M.jpg
To do the second stitch I aligned the faces of the two strips of tabs: http://imgur.com/Rf7oP.jpg   &amp; http://imgur.com/TWuoQ.jpg 
Then stitch the ribbon in through the back and out the front:  http://imgur.com/LyoEP.jpg 
When you unfold the tabs it will look like this: http://i.imgur.com/VYb3w.jpg 

9.	Tie off the ends of the ribbon and attach the pieces together. 

You can line the chainmail with fabric to make it more comfortable. I used fleece to line the chainmail by hand sewing the fleece to the tabs.
 
If this “how to” is confusing at all (which it probably is cause I suck at explaining things) feel free to ask any questions. Also if you do end up making chainmail please send me a picture because I would love to see how it turned out! 

P.S. Once you get the hang of working with the tabs, purses and who knows what else.

1.  **The posting/resume:**  
2.  Before the interview  
3.  The interview and afterwards  

I'm doing this because people are starting to apply (and businesses are starting to think about) summer students and hiring new grads

Finally

**The posting/resume:**  

 - Look everywhere.  With the way the economy has gone
 - The employer will ask for everything possible in the posting, Windows7, Ubuntu 10.10, and Remedy isn't going to happen, so they will trade 1 skill for another (especially in the nice to have areas).  
- Often times when requirements are flushed out
 - They want someone with experience
 - 7 years experience generally means 5 years experience.  
 - 5 years experience generally means 3 years experience.  
 - 3 years experience generally means you've seen it before and played with it for 6 months.   
- Some (in my experience better) companies hire more for fit (personality) than skills.  Sometimes the 6 months isn't even necessary if you can make your resume and personality stand  
out.  
 - Postings tend to happen cycle quickly, then HR will pull the  
listing to minimize their workload.  
 - Get a LinkedIn profile and keep it up to date (log in twice a month.) I've received a number of emails from headhunters and got my current job through it. For the amount of effort involved it's well worth the time.  
 - Post your resume on as many sites as you can
 - Tailor your resume for the job
 - A resume is there to give a snapshot of who you are
 - Take a look at the posting and steal their language. **VERY important**...If their posting has: *Anticipate, identifying, tracking and resolving application issues and risks* in your resume (as long as it's true).  Don't do this the whole way through, but a couple of lines are great; now HR can present you because you have exactly skill X that they're looking for.  
 - Get someone else to look over your resume to spot your mistakes and make suggestions.  In a perfect world you'll find someone who cares more about the resume than your immediate feelings.  A resume is a very personal thing
 - Your resume should be made up of bullet points
 - Where numbers are available
 - If you are going with a standard resume
 - If you have the chops to pull off something different, and he knows his audience.  
 - I've seen a few resumes on PowerPoint/keynote which have worked out well.  These should be no more than 1 page.  
 - If you're using a program other than word to create your resume
 - Each job is different
 - And finally a brilliant tip from [madoxster]

4. put those two strings together:

5. you now have a random password

However, use it, and not tell anyone. Some ways it could be improved:

* to be more random (brute force attempts incorporate some patterns

* to include capital letters

* to guarantee to include symbols

* to be longer

* take care of special cases (some websites don't allow some symbols

* to work on mobile phones

* Avoid any actions or thoughts that make your adrenaline surge for an hour or so before bedtime.  No arguing

* Gradually reduce the light levels around you as you get closer to your bedtime.  No bright light for at least a half hour beforehand if you can manage it.  Your body is pre-programmed to get sleepy in the dark.  When I'm eating a late dinner

* No sugars, and keep the carbohydrates to a minimum.  I'd probably avoid nicotine too.  Lean protein has been the best for me.  This can make a HUGE difference.

* Create a bedtime ritual.  Do it every single night before bed to reinforce to your subconscious mind that you are approaching bedtime.  I usually shower, and then go immediately to bed.

So now you've got yourself in a calm, and you're laying on your pillow... now what?

First off, and it is a particularly bad time to be thinking about nearly anything.  Thoughts have a different feel at night.  Everything is more serious, more grave, more somber.  It's just because of the circumstances, though.  The best time to think about things is when you're awake, and alert, and feeling ready for action.  Bedtime is for sleeping.  That's it.

One of the best ways to fall asleep I've ever found is by running through some complex mechanical task in my mind in as much detail as I could.  Rebuilding the carb on my dirt bike or doing mountain bike maintenance were the ones that worked the best.  Don't just run through a checklist of the steps- really picture yourself there, etc.  The more detail, the better.

I personally don't read right before bed anymore

Hopefully some of this is helpful to those of you out there who have trouble getting to sleep.  It can take some work at first, you'll look forward to bedtime more, and it sets up an upward spiral.

EDIT- One last thing: I find it helps me to cool off a bit before climbing under the covers.  I can't sleep at all if I'm even a little bit warm.  I think this may be one of those things that varies a lot from person to person,False,self,t5_2qh69,True,,,t3_fwn03

What about those companies that simply refuse to remove you from their lists?
Here's a simple way to get yourself removed that only takes about 10 minutes. Google the company and terms like president, ceo, cfo, and any other important title you can think of.

Gather up a list of the names and create email addresses based on them. So if Mike Hunt is the CEO of domain.com

Forward the spam you've received from this company to the email addresses you've collected letting them know that their company is in violation of federal CANSPAM laws. Tell them they have 24 hours to notify you that you have been removed from their mailing lists. If they fail to respond, no matter what, kind of like the current company you are emailing).

I have had CEO's of multimillion dollar businesses respond to my emails asking me to stop signing them up for newsletters (I kind told him that I would stop as soon as his company stopped). I've had frantic after hours emails from marketing departments begging me to stop emailing their Board. I've had email marketing companies cuss me for getting their contracts cancelled.

tldr;

1. Receive spam from real company

2. Gather email addresses for import people in said company

3. Email them asking to be removed

4. Sign them up for as many newsletters as you can find

**Torrent**

You'll need two things -- a torrent client and the .torrent file or magnet link from a trusted source that will provide the client with the needed information to hook up with other users and begin downloading.

If you're looking for a client, and 1:2 down/up normally.

*Torrents*

* http://thepiratebay.se

* http://isohunt.com

* http://kat.ph/

* ~~http://demonoid.me~~  R.I.P.

* http://www.vertor.com

* http://www.torrentdownloads.net/

* http://www.limetorrents.com/

* http://eztv.it

*Meta-search engines:*

* http://torrentscan.com/

* http://torrentz.eu/

* [Google-powered custom search (a little outdated)](http://www.google.com/cse?cx=003849996876419856805:erhhdbygrma&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=&amp;sa=Search#gsc.tab=0&amp;gsc.q=queen%20news%20of%20the%20world)

*Legal/open domain torrent sites:*

* http://www.legittorrents.info/

* http://www.clearbits.net/

* http://www.publicdomaintorrents.net/

**Open directories**

Open directories are simply unprotected folders that have been left open to the public (be it intentionally or accidentally). Huge pots of files can be found all across the web full of pictures, porn, whatever. Once you find an open directory, you can either click on the wanted files one by one to download or grab them all at once using wget (available on all platforms, tutorial [here](http://www.regravity.com/documents/Wget%20%96%20A%20Noob%92s%20guide%20-%20Regravity.com.pdf)). /r/opendirectories is an awesome reddit to subscribe to, and the community will be a good place to ask questions or get help with wget.

To search for files in open directories
You want pages containing ""index of"" in the title. You do not want HTML pages, or ""php"". Put the type of files you want to end up with in quotes (for example, ""mp3"" or ""epub""). You end up with a search looking like [this](https://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=queen+news+of+the+world+%22.mp3%22+-inurl%3Ahtm+-inurl%3Ahtml+-inurl%3Aphp+intitle%3A%22Index+of%22+-site%3Awallywashis.name&amp;cad=h).

If you want to use wget

    wget -e robots=off -r --no-parent -c --limit-rate=150k [url here

remove --limit-rate=150k or change the number if you like

**File-hosting sites**

[Filestube](http://www.filestube.com/) searches Mediafire, and other sites (see the advanced search option for a full list). I've found filestube to be far superior to its rivals, which tend to only search a few of the big sites.

I've gotten so good at it that I'm usually the best dancer in the club now (Not hard considering 90% of people who go don't actually know how to dance).  You don't need any special kind of talent or athletic ability either.  I've turned friends with zero dancing experience into pretty decent dancers within an hour. I've seen overweight dudes busting it out on the dance floor.  **Anyone can do it.**

At first, listen to the beat, and practice some basic moves. It's very therapeutic.

First thing you need to learn how to do is to listen to the beat of whatever music you're listening to.  It's usually the drum or bass in the background and remains steady throughout the song.  **The secret to dancing is to simply match your movements to the beat.**  You can move however the hell you like - as long as it fits with the beat.  As a beginner exercise, move your hips side to side on each beat.  Got it?  Congratulations, you can now officially follow a beat.  As long as you can recognize and move to it,  you can dance to anything.

Now for the actual dancing.  Easiest way would probably be to start off with hip hop style moves like the [two-step](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L3QrP1kiRko)

Once you got the basics down

* If you like techno/electronic/dubstep, liquid, and jump style.

* If you like latin music, and mambo. A lot of latin style dancing requires a partner 
though so you may need to find a local bar or club to do it in.

* If you like hip-hop/r&amp;b, locking, turfing, krumping, and jerkin.

* Rock and metal music doesn't really have a dance style as it mainly just involves jumping up and down

* There's also swing dancing which usually involves a partner like in lindy hop, and west coast swing.

Personally

Plus, your self-confidence levels will shoot through the roof. So even if you don't ever plan to dance in public, you'll still feel the effects of it in your daily life.  You won't regret it.",,False,self,t5_2qh69,,http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/1jwi8c/how_to_dance/

It doesn’t help that I sit most of the day.  The chair doesn’t breathe and my pants seem to form a sauna.

I’ve always suffered from “swamp ass”.  I’ve tried everything.  Here are a few things I’ve done to stop it.

A cold burst – End your shower with a cold burst.  A lot of times I get out of a hot shower and am actually sweating.  It seems like I can never stop sweating in the morning if I do this.  I love hot showers

Start dry – After showering in the morning, you’ll never get dry on your own.  Then once you’re dry apply…

Gold Bond – Gold Bond is basically baby powder for adults.  It has menthol in it and feels like sitting on a block of ice.  Make sure you’re dry when you sprinkle some on though or else you’ll have a mess.  Gold Bond is best used with…

Moisture wicking underwear – Get the good kind.  I always grew up wearing regular boxers.  They’d bunch up and be a sweaty mess.  Then someone told me about moisture wicking boxer briefs.  I tried them out and never went back.  They keep you cool, but are nothing compared to having…

A fan – This is by far the best way to keep cool all day and avoid swamp ass.  I bought a small desk fan the other day and it’s amazing.  Everybody should have one of these at their desks.  The thing was six bucks

Any other ideas?

The first step if you have any friends or family that buy things from Amazon is to make an account [here.](https://affiliate-program.amazon.com/)

The next step is to find out if any of your friends have an associate account or are willing to make one for your purchases.

HOW TO BUY CORRECTLY:

Do you have a friend who has an associate account?

Yes - 

* Take a link such as this http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/

* Get a tag and save it some place so you can use it. Mine is eonstuf-20 for example so I will show with that.

* Add ?tag=eonstuf-20 at the end

* [http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/?tag=eonstuf-20](http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/?tag=eonstuf-20)

* Now a percentage of your purchase goes to your friends account so they get a small percentage of what you payed

No - 

* Take a link such as this http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/

* Add ?tag=childsplaycha-20 at the end

* [http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/?tag=childsplaycha-20](http://www.amazon.com/Paradox-Interactive-20100325MBW-Mount-Blade/dp/B003E35XE8/?tag=childsplaycha-20)

* Now a percentage of your purchase goes to Child's Play

Any time someone buys from amazon without one of these they are denying either their friend of free money or a charity of some money.

I shape coded the numbers to better show the set up and added my own way to arrange the addition in the later steps.

The Procedure:
1) Lay out the numbers as shown in a grid formation.
2) Multiply each grid intersection.
3) Add the columns together vertically.
4) From right to left add the first (or first two) number(s) from each column to the value next to it.
5) Carry down the final values to reveal the final value!

1331768423.0,qwyao,As requested: How to give your guitar a professional paint job.,Riemann_Solution,158,32,27,"So 17 hours ago I created this account and posted a pic of my guitar's [new paint job.](http://www.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/qvfz1/finished_painting_my_guitar_what_do_you_think/) Reddit approved

[Here's](http://imgur.com/7RRn7) a before picture

**Things you'll need:**
Go out and buy these things. Home depot will have most of the stuff

* Your guitar (Like I said... idiot-proof)
* The highest grit sanding sponge you can find 
* Mask
* One can of spray primer
* 1 can of lacquer spray paint for each color you want
* 3 cans of lacquer clear  spray paint
* 3M perfect-it rubbing compound (gotta order this online)
* 3M perfect-it swirl mark remover (online as well)
* 600, 1500, etc... grit wet sandpaper
* 2""
* Exact-o knife
* 2x2 block of wood
* [Screw-on hook thingy](http://photo-dictionary.com/photofiles/list/6181/8142screw_hook.jpg)

**Things to know:** First and foremost, expect to see cracks in your finish. Don't paint outside, or somewhere where small particles float around (I made this mistake, and now my guitar has wood shavings embedded in it). Don't spray paint without a mask! And open a window for god sakes! Finally, don't paint while on fire. If you're on fire, you're doing it wrong.

**1. Disassemble your guitar:** Use a screwdriver to disassemble your guitar. Put the pieces in appropriately labeled zip-lock bags and store them somewhere. Make sure to label where each wire is connected. If your guitar's neck detaches

**2. Sanding the paint:** The layers of paint on your guitar are like so: paint-&gt;primer-&gt;wood grain finish-&gt;wood. Start sanding your guitar with the sanding sponge (use your mask). Once you see silver, your guitar will be smooth like Pootie Tang. If it's rough to the touch, you've sanded past the wood grain finish, and you'll have to paint on some more of your own finish (I didn't have to do this, so you're on your own here.) [Here's](http://imgur.com/Qjz2Q) mine halfway through sanding. Notice the silver primer on the edge of the red paint.

**3. Mask off the neck socket and binding:** So yea, you won't be able to reattach your neck exactly as it was before.

**4. Whip out the hook 'n stick:** Take your 2x2 stick and cut it to about arm's length. Screw in the large hook to one end. Screw on the other end to the guitar as if it were the neck. The purpose of this stick is to 1)  hang the guitar while it's drying

**5. Modify the wood:** If you're planning on putting in new hardware, but thankfully the knobs covered up my mistake.

**6. Learn the spraying method:** For the parts that involve spraying, giving the paint a rough texture. Start spraying away from the guitar, not while you're aiming at it. Make horizontal passes over the guitar, taking about 1 second per pass. Each pass should overlap half of the previous pass. If paint starts running, stop painting, let it dry a little, sand the run down, then the back/front. 

**7. Spray the primer:** Using the above spraying technique

**8. Spray the base coat:** Your base coat should be the lightest color you're using. If this is your only color, you'll barely be covering the guitar. You won't get the color you want until your 4th or 5th coat. Working slow like this is the best way to avoid runs. I didn't get a single run when I painted my guitar.)

**9. Mask your guitar and slice it:** Using the 2"" masking tape

**10. Spray the second color:** herp derp. This color should be your next darkest color. If this is your last color

**11. Tape up again

**12. Peel off the tape:** Now you can peel off all of the tape you put down (except for the tape in the neck socket). When peeling

**13. Spray ALL the clear paint!:** Herpin derpin. When you're done

**14. Agonizing Torture:** Now you have to let the guitar sit for 3 months. I know, you'll notice that the finish will take on the texture of whatever it's resting on, which is a terrible way to ruin your paint job. I read that Gibson lets their guitars sit for 6 months before they touch them, so you should feel lucky.

**15. Wet Sanding** Start wet sanding using a sanding block and your wet sandpaper. You'll notice that there are obvious bumps between your colors. This is because you caked on so many layers of paint.  Start with lower grits- your goal here is to get rid of the ridges. When you get to the higher grits, though, stop what you're doing, get another can of clear, and go back to step 13.

**16. Buffin':** Whip out the 3M buffing solution and a 100% cotton fabric (I used an old t-shirt). Apply a dab of solution to one section of the guitar and rub it in with the cotton. The harder you rub

**17. Reassemble and Enjoy:** In case you haven't noticed

I didn't take any pictures while I was spraying on coats of paint

**EDIT 1:** So some people were asking how I did my design specifically. When I was at step 9, spaced uniformly. This created a triangle pattern.

1308213689.0,i1313,HOW TO get rid of raised moles with apple cider (really works!),jinchoung,167,52,120,"**dammit

so i'm not part of the apple cider vinegar industrial complex, cider or bottling. i have no stake in lying. and i'm a regular redditor who has engaged in discussions not involving quackery or apple cider vinegar.

i'm a computer graphics artist that has always had three smallish but distinct moles on my face - elevated ones - that i always wanted to just get rid of but never did cuz they're cosmetic and therefore not covered by insurance and the cost of cutting or lasing the suckers off was ridiculous... easily in the xbox 360 range...
so on impulse

sure enough
i didn't have much faith but i figured i didn't have anything to lose that some neosporin won't fix up even if everything went to total crap so i tried.

and it worked **AMAZINGLY** well.

note - i've had a doctor previously look at my moles (in the hopes of getting them removed) and the doc said they were completely benign and therefore uncovered by insurance. don't try to remove a mole BEFORE you know whether it is benign or what. if you somehow remove a malignant mole

----------------------
WHAT YOU'LL NEED:

- apple cider vinegar - i got a natural
- sewing needle/sandpaper scrap/emery board. something to scratch your mole with.
- scotch tape.
- toilet paper.
- eyedropper or qtip - just something to moisten the toilet paper scrap with - more on this later.
- everything should cost less than $5 and most of it you'll have at home.

------------------------------------
PROCEDURE:

- using a sewing needle, mine were elevated a bit (smaller than a small pimple but still elevated) so i ended up pincushioning it with the needle too.
- get scotch tape
- use the eyedropper or qtip to get the ACV and soak the toilet paper pad on the tape.
- put the tape such that the ACV infused pad is right on top of the mole.
- if you abraded correctly
this means it's working! leave it on overnight.
- next day
that acid in the ACV is totally not messing around... it has BURNED your mole to the point of killing it!

-----------------------------------------------------
i did my moles for two nights in a row and they became quite emphatically scabs.

i even got impatient to see if there was anything UNDER the mole so i pulled a bit of scab off to look underneath (something i would not have been able to do at all with the ""healthy"" mole). PALE SKIN! and at about the level where the rest of my skin lies! (note

i'm currently on day 3 and am just applying neosporin to help the healing process.

what should happen now is that the scabs should heal and fall off and with them
may leave a bit of a discolored mark or scar underneath though i've read that for many, i am just happy to be rid of my black little moles.

note - i cannot guarantee results or good results that you would like so definitely do your research and test on non-essential places (bottoms of feet or something... may not want to start with your face if you're a model or something) if you can. i am not liable to what you do to yourself.

especially if you are a model or actor or someone whose appearance is their life

but for me
anyhoo

please be careful. rock on.

p.s. all my moles were elevated... little bumps. i hear they are shallower than flat moles. i have no experience on how well this works on flat moles so if you want to get rid of those

--------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: before pic: http://twitpic.com/5cozb6 ... sorry

---------------------------------------------------

UPDATE: screw apple cider vinegar - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000GCLTT8 this is much easier, you can just peel it off.  again, YMMV but for me, this worked great and i would recommend compound-w dry sealing gel much much more than apple cider vinegar.  thanks for the folks who recommended it in this thread.",,False,self,True,t3_i1313

For the last three years, have been working to conserve and restore the unique primary forests near the rural community of Ilomena in southwestern Madagascar. One of the top ten hotspots of biodiversity on Earth, the forests of Madagascar are home to over 200,000 different species. An estimated 80% of these plants and animals are endemic to the island of Madagascar and are found nowhere else in the world. Even so, over 100,000 hectares of these forests, and the rare plants and animals in them

To reverse this dramatic decline,000 trees just this year, but we can't do it alone. To support us, we are offering seeds of a Madagascan baobab tree (Adansonia za) for you to plant at home. The funds raised here will go directly to the nursery and reforestation program to help us grow year over year.

Each seed purchased helps fund the planting of two new trees.


**More informations** :
As said on the website
What is not said on the website is that we are absolutely need new funds to complete this years
We need at least 5 000€ , as it is the only source of work available in this area.
That is why we came with this idea of selling seeds to support our project : we need money to continue our initiative
We already have made some sells

**We needs feedbacks to help us sell more seeds!**

Some questions : 

* Is it ok for you
* How about the price? not too expensive? what if we had a 5 seeds packs at 5€ ?

3. Select Goal Seek
4. Set Cell: A1

Sandboxie runs your programs in an isolated space which prevents them from making permanent changes to other programs and data in your computer.

We will be using sandboxie to run our browser securely. This by itself is a great start. It runs your browser in an isolated area

Truecrypt Creates a virtual encrypted disk within a file and mounts it as a real disk. This is how we will be using truecrypt. If you don't have it already download it


Now that you have your encrypted volume set up. Mount it using your password. Your volume should be mounted like another disk with it's own letter (you choose w/e letter you like).

Now you can install sandboxie. **but first** choose to install sandboxie *within* the encrypted volume. So browse to your encrypted drive and install it there.


And now you are done. You have set up an encrypted volume. That you can use to store files like pictures or videos. And you also have your sandboxie program installed to the encrypted volume. This is done just incase somebody finds the sandboxie programs and opens a browser in it to find your browser history. this keeps that from happening by having it the the encrypted volume. once you are done accessing the volume and dismount it the sandboxie program wont be accessible due to it now being encrypted.



**::IMPORTANT::**


**KEEP YOUR PASSWORD SECURE**


**REMEMBER TO DISMOUNT YOUR ENCRYPTED VOLUME WHEN YOU ARE DONE** (leaving it open defeats the purpose you know)

* Freezing at the doctor
* Freezing with a home kit
* Duct Tape
* A pocket knife
* A bunch of other crap that really hurt

Finally, and within a month my gigantic wart infestation was totally gone. I'll break down the process here. First, supplies:

* Apple Cider Vinegar (I used a $1 bottle from WalMart)
* Medical Tape ([this stuff](http://www.amazon.com/Durapore-Medical-Tape-Silk-yards/dp/B000C4O7GC))
* Cotton balls or cotton pads
* Scissors (useful

Here is what you do. Every night before you go to sleep, you can do it during the day too. The idea is to cover it with vinegar for 8-12 hours per day. Do not cover it 24 hours a day!

Sometimes I don't want to flip over the bugs with my fingers because I'm afraid I'll damage the fragile legs or body. Other times I don't want to risk getting bit/stung. And in the case of the water dish

Flipping them over each time and/or removing them (part of the Insect Relocation Program) has been comically awkward until I stumbled onto this tip by accident:  

- Fold a piece of tissue or paper in half.  
- Hold it over the insect's body lengthwise
 - The little legs will immediately stop flailing and clamp onto the tissue/paper (it's actually kinda cute and funny to watch).
- The little critter will then climb up and over the tissue/paper
- Done!

Once it's on the paper you can either easily carry it outside, then just follow the same instructions above. If the critter is right-side up in the water, place the paper almost level with the water surface and slightly under the bug -- it will respond in the same way, allowing you to relocate it.

Hello Friends I hope this will be helpful to someone out there!

edit: The inspiration for this came from my bike however these will be useful anywhere a normal ziptie would slip around due to lack of friction. Metal, other plastics...

I have a older frame that came without mounts for my new hydraulic brake cables. I tried to remedy the situation for a while with some zip-ties but they kept coming loose against the frame and my cables would slide around.

I came up with a cheap solution that works so well that I thought I would share it with you!

**Plasti Dip**
""Multi-Purpose Rubber Coating""

Line a bunch of zip-ties on some old cardboard and spray the underside of the zip-tie

1334163383.0,s4kph,Homebrew UHF-VLF antenna and receiver for picking up pretty much anything in the radio spectrum.,Craigellachie,89,24,10,"Ok

First off if you have no idea about radio or electronics at all for that mater I'd recomend building a [diode radio](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystal_radio). There are plans all over the internet for this and they are vary simple consisting of an antenna (any long metal object that will resonate with radio frequencies) a coil of copper wire which acts as an [inductor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inductor)

Ok so that wall of text aside, I'd recommend you buy yourselves electronics hobby books or kits as they go into far more detail than I can. It then becomes a simple matter of buying an adaptor for the antenna port on your UHF TV and fiddling with the tuner. The efficiency of the antenna and the quality of your tuner will determine what signals you pick up. I know a guy who used a massive  8m homemade horn antenna to actually pick up cosmic microwave background radiation. There is even a ham radio on the space station so if you arrange a time you can call them up. However that is the result of years fiddling with radio signals.

Amateur radio is a great hobby to get into as there are thousands of stations on air and millions of walkie talkies

Mouth Brush is a tooth brush that has a 360º degree bristles is the shape of a tear drop. As the bristles get closer to the point of the drop it will be more firm bristles which would allow you to dig into food holes in your teeth.

Having the bristles going 360º around will cut brushing your teeth in half because while you are brushing the top, pretty much your whole mouth.

Oral care needs more than a toothbrush... It needs a mouth brush.

The drain is a standard drain that sits flush with the ground.  But when there is heavy rain, &amp; sticks) piles up on top of this drain and clogs the drain - preventing any water from going down the drain.  When this happens, and the rain is heavy enough, the basement will start to flood.

I have seen some dome shaped drain covers before and I think this would resolve my issue but I have been unable to find one.  Does anyone know where I could get one or have a different idea to solving this issue?

This is by far the best way I've found to wash my cats.  The trick is to get the cats clean as quickly as possible and with the minimum of personal injury.

Have a shower with a sliding glass door

Get in the shower with the cat and close the doors. It helps if you have kind of a dumb cat who doesn't know how to open sliding glass doors but if not you can keep one hand on the door to keep the cat from getting out

Do **not** try to hold the cat. This will only guarantee a clawing at some point. Let him keep his feet on the floor and he won't be thinking about sinking them into you.

Spray the cat down with the shower, avoid the nose and eyes. 

If you are gentle your cat will not claw you though he might continue to try to escape one way or another. I often use a cat brush to get the soap in better and to help remove loose fur.

Rinse off the cat, including underneath, and thoroughly get all the soap off.

Have a couple of dry towels handy once you turn off the water. Leaving your cat's paws on the floor

It's nearly impossible to dry the cat completely without a hair dryer

Yes, but they really seem to enjoy being clean once they've dried off. 

I usually bathe them only a couple of times a year

It might work for a recent model but they manufacturer might have fixed it. If you lift up the handle of your Ranger there are two holes. If you take the unscrewed radio antenna and put it in the hole  closest to the bed of the truck (MAKE SURE THE WINDOW IS ROLLED UP OR YOU CAN RUIN YOUR WINDOW) You need to take the screw end of the antenna and maneuver the antenna around inside the door you can feel the lock mechanism start to push up. If you push get the lock to push up as high as you think you can you want to slowly release the handle still holding the antenna in place. If done correctly the lock will stay in place and not fall back down. It may take a few tries and it can get quite frustrating.
