1276703264.0,cfnj4,A reddit FTP server!,phuzion,306,61,256,"So, what the hell

So

* Only uploads and downloads work
* Deleting is not possible by average users (I reserve the right to do so)
* Files are not modified in any way after being uploaded
* Use of the service is open to all redditors
* I reserve the right to ban any specific IP addresses for abuse

So, feel free to check it out.  It's currently hosted on a cable internet connection, and is nowhere near as fast as I would like it to be, but I will investigate the possibility of moving it to my other, much faster server soon.

The connection details are as follows:

* **Hostname:** *redacted*
* **Port:** *redacted*
* **Username:** *redacted*
* **Password:** *redacted*
* **Protocol:** *redacted*
* [Or just click here](http://www.google.com ""redacted"")

If you need an FTP client, Mac or Linux.

If anyone has any feedback on the server

Enjoy!

EDIT:  Because some assholes can't take a fucking hint

EDIT2:  I'm taking the server down for an hour or so

EDIT3:  If you have a request to have a particular file deleted

EDIT:  **The server has been quiesced.  This means any existing transfers will be allowed to finish, I'm going out to eat and can't sit and watch this the entire time.  As of 6:00PM EST NO NEW TRANSFERS WILL BE ALLOWED.** 

** Final Note:** For the time being, but that might not be for a while.  As of right now, I simply do not want to take the risks associated with operating an anonymous filesharing service.  If I do decide to do something similar to this again, I'll certainly let everyone know.

Thanks

I understand that this is a risk inherent in hosting an open web server. But please understand that a lot of people who host open directories are just wanting an easy way to share things, anti-spider measures, bandwidth throttling and the like. 

This is more important with ""readyshare"" routers, and no way to easily moderate it. Throw in bandwidth caps that most ISPs are throwing in now days, and you can wind up causing serious hassle for people.

It's good to see that most links already use the coral cache

*updated with more info:* due to some misunderstandings
Top of my access log two days ago is the referall link from a google search of ""Index of parent directory filetype:"". Standard stuff used to find a open directory. However, which then threw up direct hotlinks to my poor home server. Since then, I've pulled the files, moved the directory structure, and hid it from the root url, so that it's no longer accessible.

I just found this subreddit through randomly searching reddit. Everything seems pretty interesting here. I have a few questions I was hoping someone would be able to answer.

* Do i need to install any software to download from open directories? 
* I noticed the WGET guide... what is it and how is it used? Is that how you find these directories?
* Is this illegal (don't worry I'm not the police)
* I've clicked some of the links and found various directories. Sometimes I get a 503 error or a different error from Google saying something like ""Directory not found."" I'm using Chrome

I hope someone can find it useful. :),AllahCoholic,12,1,3,"Opendirectories: A bit like virtual dumpster diving for some interesting/useful files out there in the open, and download what you want. I'm not tech/code savvy at all so don't worry

Okay

1: [intitle:index of](https://encrypted.google.com/search?q=intitle%3A%22index+of%22)

2: Drag and drop the Coralize bookmarklet at the bottom of this page [here](http://www.coralcdn.org/plugins/).

3: Drag and drop the third

Okay. So the first google bookmarklet is essentially the primary key to finding open directories. Click and add then search for what you want. Give it a go! Add MP3/PDF/MOBI/EPUB at the end to restrict your search to files (but not too restricting as filetype:x).

The second bookmark automatically adds .nyud.net to any url you're on which enables you to use the Coral cache network to mirror files for you to download without crashing the original server - and interestingly enough, especially when there are alternative methods, which I'll come back to.

The third bookmarklet can sometimes help when you reach a dead directory/website. Click on the Wayback bookmarklet to check if it's been archived by the Wayback machine. Also, you've added it to a queue of websites to later on be cached. Check it out some time later to find it cached! This doesn't work well with directories but it works quite well on webpages and news articles. Once something has been cached by Wayback, you never need to worry about it disappearing or going down (unless you make a special request to them). It's on the web forever! If wayback doesn't have the dead directory, enter the url in google and see if Google has cached it. Google the filename(s) to find them elsewhere, if you can.

There is a fantastic firefox addon called [Location Bar Enhancer](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ui-enhancer/) which makes browsing directories really easy via the url bar. Each level/folder in the url becomes a clickable button and moving up one

[IDM](http://www.internetdownloadmanager.com/) is the best download tool ever. When you want to download a list of files on a directory, for every YouTube vid you watch (and practically ANY other you find online, Vimeo/Liveleak etc), you get the option to [download](http://i.imgur.com/rCJWqMs.png) flv/mp4 vids (for youtube, from 240p to 1080p quality), if possible. Your downloads are accelerated and the speed can be limited, too so you don't hog speeds for other internet users in the house. I highly recommend it. You can try it for free and then buy it for $25 or it can be found on other places of the [web](http://www.warez-bb.org/viewtopic.php?t=14744350). Other firefox addons such as [DownThemAll](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/downthemall/) work great

Music. I used to [YouTube to MP3](http://onlinevideoconverter.com) my music because it was quicker than torrenting (and felt less illegal for some reason) but then when I learnt about opendirectories, maybe you guys might find it interesting. It works great on tablets too, and it's 100% free and safe so there's no monthly ties like spotify, you can do what you want with the mp3 files you choose to download.

If you found a big file/movie on a directory and want a way to store it without downloading it or the directory going down, log yourself out, and then just buffer a movie for a minute or start downloading a file and then cancel it after a few seconds. Works great!

Also,[watchseriesonline](http://watchseriesonline.eu), or [fanstash](http://www.fanstash.eu) etc. And then you can download, even in a smaller mobile-friendly mp4 format. Note: for userscripts, you'll need an addon to install them such as [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) for Firefox or [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en) for Chrome.

Ebooks. Many epubs which I like to read can now be found mostly via opendirectories, which also includes some fantastic websites to find textbooks and more. Check it out. IRC has found the epubs I've wanted pretty much nearly every single time.

So that's all I could think of from the top of my head
Happy searching and best wishes to all. AC

edit: spelling

P.S. And as always, do whatever you want. I'm just another internet stranger at the end of the day, and always remember, you don't really have any obligations towards anyone on the net. That's just my point of view... and er, we can't all be the same(?) :)",,False,t5_2r1e4,True
