I did some research, that hasn't been actually in business for more than about 4 months. So basically, its ""I'm the King of Everything"" syndrome, so he doesn't seem to believe he has anyone to answer to.

So, and relayed every bit of information I could find of who he is, what his company has done, and anything else I could find. At about 1 PM, I get a call from my boss explaining that he talked to the manager that had actually requested the extra security, and the woman that apparently hired them, who was an off-site

My boss explained my side of the story, unabashed harassment. They were shocked, and promptly shredded the contract with AAA, and barred them from future service with the corporation.

Then, and his supervisors and our corporate managers had my back as well.

I am loved

Anyway, *just* officially opened their doors on Monday. So they're **really** off to a great start.

1374075476.0,1ihowp,My mother stole my identity. I don't know what I am.,Genderless_,145,25,83,"My friends and girlfriend always bug me for never talking about my fucked up past. I've never told anyone this. I hope you guys can help me.

This is my last chance at living a normal life. 

My mom always wanted a girl... and she was 100% sure she was pregnant with one. She had bought baby girl clothes

I wasn't born female and... My mother didn't like that. 

She quit her job as successful architect and moved us from Asheburn Chicago to  an upper class neighborhood in New York. (I have requested I do not learn the exact location for emotional reasons.) Started a new life and cut contact off with pretty much almost everyone when she found out I was going to be born male. She snapped and decided to raise me as a girl anyways; like she always wanted. She refused to believe I was male.

I was Rebecca. 

I guess you could say I grew up a typical little girl. I was enjoying life, like all normal girls. 

When I was of age

That life lasted until the ending of grade 3. I remember that day like no other. We would have long assemblies every 1st Friday of the month about school activities, etc. And I really had to go pee, and I guess I couldn't hold it; a teacher quickly noticed my accident. She and another teacher brought me to the change room to get me a new skirt and I guess that's when they noticed I was not a female. 

At first

What really got me was the hair. I loved long hair

Later growing up I was explained all the details of the story and it all was really confusing. I didn't like being a boy, ""you're NOT a girl."" 

I'm 19 now. I'm not thrilled with my life but I'm enjoying it somewhat now more then I was a couple years ago. I'm not the most masculine guy but that's okay. I talk to my mom every once in a while but I don't like too. It brings back to many memories. I've maybe spoken to her a handful of times since the event. She still lives in New York, awesome man. 

I've recently been having very dysphoric feelings about being male but I don't know if its because of my past or me missing my mom or that I'm trans or all of the above. I don't mind being a guy now

If you read this...Thank you

**TL;DR:**My insane mother raised me as a girl for 7 years until the police and child services got involved. who am I?

There is not one standard trans narrative.  We each have our own stories.

Where language gets problematic is when we aren't the ones telling our own stories; when our narratives are reduced to cis-friendly tidbits.  

It's okay to talk about being trapped; it's okay to say you were born a boy or a girl and are now something else.  It's not okay when the media would have society at large believe that there is only one way to be trans.

his mom ""figured me out"" and flipped the script. his whole family are pentacostal christians (ya know, unclean homosexual, being a ""man's bitch"", and other horrible things. this didn't just come from his family, but his extended family, his friends, and even his community. nearly everyone he knows has betrayed him in some way. his grandfather even pulled a shotgun on him and demanded he get off his property when he was trying to visit his niece and nephew. they've tried to take his car away and send him to a straight doctor. i don't know how that would end up working since he loves tits and ass and long hair and legs.

his family is very wealthy. they're like the joneses. they own a lot of businesses in their little town and a lot of people work for them. they have their hands in the pockets of law enforcement and politicians. they pretty much control the entire town and if they don't like you, or worse.

6/11/2013, but still quite a trip.

The trip almost died before it even began. We arrived at Houston IAH airport around 12:30, but they said they couldn't find them. We went to another counter, and the rude lady looked it up.

She told us that our tickets had somehow been cancelled. We got the tickets back in April. Originally there was some trouble with my credit card

Well, and told us to just call the customer service number.

I did

This was impossible as no refund ever showed up on my account. Additionally, they just told me to call my credit card company. 

I think what really happened was there was a mixup with their system and they were trying to pass the buck. They offered to let us purchase two completely new tickets at the current rate, she gave some BS line about their being no higher supervisor (again impossible.)

Anyway, hasn't. He and his wife had given us a ride to the airport. When they heard we were having trouble, they came back to the airport and started helping us out. I have no idea how the hell he did it, but he was able to resolve the issue. He got on the line, immediately went through several levels of ""let me talk to your supervisor"", threatening to go to the media, and was somehow able to get it straightened out. I still can't figure out exactly what they changed. 

They told him that they would charge my card at the original rate, somehow we were able to get our tickets. We got through security and got on our flight.

The trip was two 10-11 hour flights. One was between Houston and Frankfurt, sleeping the day away at noon local time.  The flight to Bangkok went a little better as the seat next to us was empty and we had some extra room. Still, we arrived in Bangkok dead tired. Hadn't slept for more than an hour or two at a time for the entire trip.

We arrived at 4 PM or so. Got picked up by the driver without any problem. Arrived at the hotel, just your basic hotel room, but it will do. Went to bed early and woke up early. Still trying to get adjusted to the local time zone. We have our first consultation with Dr. Chettawut scheduled later today.

6/12/2013 1 PM: We started the day yesterday with breakfast at the hotel. We really pigged out, we left for the consult with Chet.

We met Chettawut for the first time. Everything seems fine. He did an exam for me for SRS and for my bf for top surgery. I might end up needing a groin skin graft, do it once, do it right. He and his staff are very nice, very professional. We filled out misc paperwork, had our consultation, etc. 

In the afternoon, including HIV screening. Chest X-Ray to test for tuberculosis. We also each had a quick psych consult as required by Thai law for SRS. We got a clean bill of health and went back to the hotel.

We had planned to do some more stuff last night, and woke up around 2 AM the next morning. T_T I took a sleeping pill, got some extra sleep, and woke up around 8 AM. Hopefully we're back on schedule now. 

We had breakfast

Today we went to the mall across the street. We exchanged a few hundred dollars for baht and did some shopping for a few basic things at Tesco. From the quick look around the stores, way cheaper.

6/12/2013 4 PM: All liquid diets officially suck. You can get a fair amount of calories and nutrients from juices, but it doesn't help with the hunger. :/ 

6/13/2013 6 PM: Second day of all-liquid diet. Went to the store again, soda, and water. The closest thing I had to food was the miso soup at the breakfast buffet. Had five bowls of it! At least that helped keep the edge off the hunger, unlike yesterday. Tomorrow Aiden goes in for his top surgery and I do the worst part of the whole bowel cleansing stuff - I get to take Swiff, the human draino. :/

6/14/2013 1:15 PM: Crazy day. Got up and had breakfast, but it's really expensive, like $2 to wash a pair of underwear. Just washed everything with hand soap and hung it up to dry. So hung out in the bathroom, alternating between washing clothes and jumping on the toilet. :/

But that's nothing compared to what just happened. I just went down to the lobby to see Aiden off. Can't come with him to the surgery center, 10x more worried about him than how my surgery will go. I requested that they give me a call when he gets out of surgery safe, and I'm going to refuse to go into surgery tomorrow until I can see him and make sure everything is ok. Damn I love that guy. If anything happened to him...God. SRS is canceled at the very least. I know I worry too much. But damn, ya know? Our two year anniversary is Monday, June 17th. ;_;

6/14/2013 7:40 PM: Got the phone call. Aiden made it out of surgery fine. He's in recovery now. Meanwhile

6/15/2013 11:30 AM: Aiden got back. He was in pretty bad shape at first

6/16/2013 12:30 PM: Survived surgery. Brain in fog. In and out of sleep. Typing is hard. Catheters royally suck.

6/17/2013 5:45 AM: Made it through second night in hospital. Was just in and out of sleep all day yesterday. Yesterday had the fluid IV removed. Still in the recovery room

I've been sitting in the hospital bed for the last 36 hours. Legs spread apart as to not put pressure on the groin area. On my legs there are these things that are difficult to describe. They're large mechanical pressure garments. One leg tightens

6/17/2013 1 PM: Got moved from the recovery room to a regular hospital room. Much quieter. No big leg cuffs on. Will stay here for another two days. It's Aiden and I's two year anniversary today. &lt;3

6/18/2013 10:15 AM: Sleep cycle is all kinds of mixed up. Went to bed at 5 PM last night. Woke up at 10 PM. Surfed a bit, not move my legs too much. Did a [casual IMA](http://www.reddit.com/r/casualiama/comments/1gjne7/im_currently_laying_in_a_hospital_bed_in_bangkok/) to help pass the time. Sent some emails to my coworkers this morning, let 'em know I survived surgery. Passing the time on reddit and watching various movies at TV shows. Currently watching the Fifth Element. :P

6/18/2013 2:15 PM: Feeling better today. Had enough energy that I filled out a credit card dispute form. I looked into the situation

6/18/2013 6:40 PM Had some solid food for the first time in a week today. Just creamy soup and some crackers. Digestive system is starting up again

6/19/2013 10:15 AM: Got out of the hospital. Got the epidural taken out, really swollen. Will be able to take my first shower on Friday. Got taken back to the hotel. Got a big bag with medication to take, various supplies, and this big pink donut butt pillow to sit on. Still a bit groggy from the meds. 

6/19/2013 5 PM: First real meal in a week. Nothing but cream soup and crackers at the hospital. Mmmmm pasta. :D

6/20/2013: 1:15 We find Chettawut's aftercare to be severely deficient. They have two nurses that travel around on a part-time basis to multiple patients. i don't know how many patients he has at a time

Originally I wanted to do Aiden and I's surgeries one week apart. I would do my SRS one week before his top surgery. He would be able to help me out during my first critical week of healing

Chettawut however insisted on changing this. For whatever strange reason

Well it turns out it is. His aftercare is a joke. A nurse comes by once per day for a cursory five minute visit. From discussing with Aiden here

He was in bad shape after surgery. He spent several days alone, not deficate, while I was away, as he is unable to go clean up without assistance. While in the hospital, I repeatedly pleaded with them to make sure he was okay, and they simply said it was ok. 

It seems Dr. Chettawut or his  staff have a severe misunderstanding of the severity of FTM top surgery. They don't seem to get the concept that you essentially lose the use of your arms for two weeks after surgery. They say disturbing things like

I am back in the hotel room now and have to offer what aid I can to him. However

When the nurses came, just a wipe down with a washcloth from the sink. I was washed in such a manner while I was in the hospital, but Aiden has been alone and has not received such care. I told them that he needs washing, but they refused. They said they did not have time and that he could do it himself. They said his surgery was minor and that he's fully capable of helping himself. They're completely ignorant about the FTM top surgery recovery process. They also can't seem to grasp the concept that my boyfriend is a ""he"" not a ""she."" Constant misgendering. 

I think we'll be able to get through this

6/21/2013 9:30 AM: Might have overreacted yesterday, but when something happens to him, I really start to freak out.

We have improved one thing that really helps. We let the staff at the hotel staff know that they can simply knock on the door and come on in when we say ""come on in!"" It sounds ridiculous, and this seems to have helped. I just hope everything heals up well, the skin grafts take alright, and nothing is damaged.

As an aside, except that last night and the night before, I've had dreams involving zombies. :/ Last night was really weird, like the actual SRS trip merged with the zombie thoughts. For some reason I was worrying, ""how the hell are we going to get back to Houston? Won't the Bangkok, Frankfurt, and Houston airports be overrun with zombies? Should I even bother going home

6/21/2013 2:00 PM: The nurses came again today. Aiden's tube drains were removed, no graft failures, and the swelling has gone down a lot. It actually looks like, well, any other vagina. Spectacular results I think. :) 

Tomorrow the nurse will return and show me how to do the first dilation. That is going to hurt. Not looking forward to that. The catheter is still in

6/22/2013 3 PM: Things are going well. Still confined to the hotel room until the 26th. After that I'll be able to wander about the hotel. Settled into a routine. Breakfast in the morning

Today a nurse came and I had my first dilation. Went very well. The key is just to relax, but I still just need to move slowly, not bend my legs much, and not stress the wound. Won't be doing yoga for awhile. :D

Oh

6/23/2013 high noon: just finished watching Forrest Gump. So many waterworks. Damn movie. I can watch episode after episode of a zombie series, and I'm crying left and right. The feels. ;_;

Need to do two dilations today. Will be my first attempt to dilate by myself. We'll see how it goes. 

6/24/2013 1:45 PM: Finally got that horrible catheter out today! Took a big dose of pain medicine this morning

Had my first urination. Didn't burn and didn't have to force it, will get better with time. About to take my first shower in nine days. T_T Other than that, just chilling in the room, eagerly awaiting the results from the Supreme Court.

6/25/2013 12:15 AM: damn. No decision on the big cases. Better luck tomorrow. Moved from the number one to the number two dilator

6/25/2013 7:50: woke up too late this morning. Need to set an alarm. Woke up at 11 AM, which is included in the room, munching on some snacks during the day, then ordering dinner at night. 

Had dilation this morning. Used the number 2 dilator again. Then the nurse came

Oh

&gt;Oh

&gt;There is a laundry service available at the hotel, but it's so expensive as to be unusable. They charge per item, and it's like $6-7 to wash a pair of jeans, $2-3 to wash a pair of underwear, $4-5 to wash a t-shirt. It's fucking ridiculous.

&gt;So, my clothes really don't get that dirty, so I'm just wearing bottoms and tops 2-3 times. Even cleaned some laundry by washing by hand the day before I left for surgery.

&gt;So seriously, by underwear, wear it once, then throw it in the garbage than it is to pay for cleaning underwear here.

6/26/2013 2:30 PM: Just another day here

6/28/2013 5:30 PM: Some interesting times. As of yesterday, etc. In the last few days we met and have been hanging out with Amelia, u/ameliabee. She's awesome. :) She has surgery tomorrow, and we've commiserated a bit as she's been surviving the Swiff stuff today. :( Best of luck Amelia!

The only exciting thing today was the plumbing leak. This morning, but when I flushed the toilet the metal hose for the bidet sprayer burst and started spraying water out everywhere. We moved our stuff out of the way and made an emergency call to the front desk. Thankfully the water flowed out into the hall instead of back into the room, but still was a big mess. Had a bunch of housekeeping people in who helped clean things up. The maintenance guy fixed the leak, and everything was back to normal within an hour or so. Gave the housekeeping ladies a really nice tip today. T_T

6/28/2013 8:00 PM: Learned something interesting about Thai culture. We were talking about it

Apparently in Thailand it's actually illegal to export a Buddha statue from Thailand. We were discussing possible souvenirs

You might think it's just something to prevent cultural looting and the theft on antiques

It comes down to a matter of culture, or by your front door, is seen as a sign of respect. It's a positive thing. 

In Thai Buddhist culture, a Buddha statue should only be displayed either in a temple or in a household shrine. 

As such

7/1/2013 2:00 PM: Not much going on in the last few days. Just sitting around healing in the hotel. On Saturday

Let's see. On Saturday we left the hotel for the first time. The nurse cleared us to go on short trips around the neighborhood, apparently all the McDonalds in Thailand have Ronald's like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Ronwai01.JPG).

Medically not much going on. Have the final consultation with Chettawut this Saturday

Just slowly healing

Mainly just passing the time on reddit and watching TV. Made it all the way through Breaking Bad

7/6/2013 1:00 PM: Been too long since I posted an update. The internet has been extremely spotty for some reason

Let's see. This last week largely just much of the same. We're no longer confined to the hotel. We've been frequently walking across the street to the huge [Seacon Square Mall](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seacon_Square). We'll wake up in the morning, then later go out and do some shopping and get dinner at the mall. The prices are really good, so it's tempting to shop too much. I would love to buy a bunch of clothes, but I need to hold back. This trip is breaking the bank enough as is. Mostly just getting a few gifts for family and friends.

Medically, then half hour to an hour with #2. I'll either do three half hour sessions or two one hour sessions each day. The nurse still comes in daily to check up on us and perform a basic examination of my parts.

On Wednesday I got my final surgery letter from the doc, he accompanied us down to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, took care of the whole process. We would have been really lost without him. Totally worth paying for. His fee was 6000 baht, the Ministry charged 1200 baht, and cab fares and road tolls brought the total cost to about 6000 baht, or about $200. Totally worth it if you need the doctor's signature to be certified.

Today we went to see Chettawut one last time for the final consultation. I had to change into a hospital robe

Aiden also had his follow-up exam, as he seems to have a stomach virus of some sort. He'll get through it. It seems like one of those things that will be there and gone in a day. Still, while I was getting my exam he was sitting in Chettawut's office bathroom throwing up. :/

Other than that, as it hurts me especially to be on my feet too long. Our flight leaves late Wednesday night.

7/12/2013 12:15 PM Central Time: Finally got home last night. 

The last few days in Thailand were fairly uneventful. Just finished up with the regular routine. Got up for breakfast in the morning

Before leaving, and if maybe I should try to dilate at the airport or something. They assured me it would be fine and it's pretty normal. I could just do a long dilation session before and after, and everything should be fine.

On Wednesday we said our goodbyes. Said goodbye to Amelia as well as Morgan, things were a bit tight and it hurt, but no real damage done. I think all the flights did was set the dilation schedule back a bit.

The flights themselves were just long and bleh. Dr. Chettawut gave us a letter which did help quite a bit. The letter requested that we be given seats with extra leg room, but it helped. Took some sleeping pills on the first flight, but unfortunately we were surrounded by a half dozen infants and numerous toddlers. Sleep for a half hour, get woken up by a screaming kid. Sleep for another half hour, get woken up by a screaming kid. I don't know what people are thinking taking infants on 11 hour intercontinental flights. T_T

It was rough, so Aiden will be giving me a ride to work for awhile. Severely jet lagged, internal clock all kinds of messed up, but I have a few days to adjust.

And with that, such as the initial flight nightmare and the troubles Aiden had right after surgery, but we got through it. We met some wonderful people over in Bangkok and I can definitely recommend it to anyone considering SRS. Chet and his staff are wonderful, and I think I made a great choice going there. If anyone reading, now or in the future, has any further questions, feel free to message me and I'll be happy to respond. :)",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1g2o4v/as_promised_my_srs_thread/

**How can I be sure?**

You can't.  Life has no guarantees.  Ask yourself questions in terms of motivation rather than certitude.  A more useful question is to ask 'Am I willing to be wrong about this?'

**Do I have permission?**

Yes.  Even if your asking this question takes 4 pages and you've self-hated to the point of asking this in the most convoluted way possible

**Can someone (the trans community usually) be a proxy in which I can invest society's authority regarding gender compliance and get external permission to do this?**

No.

**Can I prove I am really sure to those who are hostile to my right to choose?**

No.

**Even if the person is me?**

Even if the person is you

**How can I frame my coming out so that the results are perfect and nothing bad ever happens?**

1327901953.0,p2nrn,RIP Kaiosyne,BrightMirror,141,57,129,"  I've not been here before, I don't expect much better.  Hopefully there is someone here who was a friend of Kaiosyne

  Sometime between Friday night and Saturday morning (27/28 Jan), but it wasn't until about 4 hours ago that his roommate noticed he was lying under layers of blankets on the couch, unresponsive.  She had been away for most of the weekend.  The ambulance and police were called, and we won't know how he went for another few days, but from what I saw, he did not appear to be in pain.  She said that when she touched him, he was cold, he looked like he was dozing off

  I use 'he', you can do the math.  I'll use the pronouns I choose, I've earned that right.  Although some troll will probably make snarky commentary about it, the last words from the paramedics were ""She's gone.""  So, I guess he got his final wish, to the point where even normal mundies were fooled.  I guess that qualifies as 'passing' in your lingo.  I wish it didn't come at such a price.

  I regret that I did not get more time with him, despite the fact he asked me to start up a game every week...I regret being too busy to do so.  I regret being the only one who's going to have to tell his boyfriend in jail that the one person who loved him despite his crimes is no more, and that he is now alone.

  However... I do not regret giving him food that last day I saw him, nor do I regret holding on to him when he cried about how everything was going wrong in his life... because he also said that moment was a 'positive experience' for him, and reminded him of the love he would eventually have.  I do not regret when he showed me pictures of his transition and there was one picture that stood out, where he looked just like a born woman, smiling all flirty, and when I pointed this out he became so incredibly happy.  I do not regret being his friend for so long, despite all the things he did and had done to him, even though being his friend could have lost me my job of ten years.

  I hope I won't have to regret posting this hear.  I hope that if there are people here who thought of him in a positive way, or do whatever it is to ease him on his way and remember his life.

  I hope his family finally learns to love him when they realize he is gone.  I hope they can give him a better epitaph than this one

  RIP my brother/sister

------------

  UPDATE 4PM, send out the message over the friend-net to all those who knew him.  The coroner called, saying that he did not die to physical trauma, to choking, or (more importantly), due to any blood clots or burst blood vessels from the anti-androgen, artificial-estrogen transition drugs.  I was afraid that might have been the case, as the transition was the thing that had turned his life around, as it might scare others away from the happiness they could find.  Fortunately

  The cause, some buildup of advanced cardiopulminary disease caused by twenty years of chain smoking, alcohol, and drug abuse, and potentially too much alcohol weakning his system at the time... not to mention depression.  He was simply attacked at all sides... nickel-and-dimed to death.  To be fair, this means most of it is, indeed, as he had cut down on all harsh drug use

  It is an important lesson for all transitioning here, happier life if you don't try to burn through it as quickly as possible.  Take care of your body, make sure you get the nourishment you need.  You'll have plenty of time to lose weight the normal way, plenty of time to enjoy becoming what you want to be.  Don't neglect yourself.  Don't think you are alone.  He never thought anyone outside his family would show up at his funeral service.  Thanks to talking with them, I know at least half a dozen spread out over four states will be there.  I wish I could be too.  I will certainly try.  I have spoken at the deaths of many in my own family.  I consider Cora no less than they.  And I would wish that no one else should have such sorrows.

  As for all who criticize my use of pronouns... try not to get lost in the thick grasses of your own prejudices.  There is a clear path here, because it isn't about you.  It's not about me 
either.  It's about someone who I and many others shared a long life with that has tragically been cut short.  It's about people who miss him, and his father who wants him cremated and his remains shipped back in a little metal urn so that he doesn't have to bear the shame of people seeing the feminine body of his own son-in-law in the casket during the funeral... despite my pleading to the contrary and pointing out how the transition made his skin smooth and youthful and soft where before it had been dried and pitted and ravaged by the events of his life, how it was a physical sign of happiness regained after so much sorrow.

  ""He"", are just stupid little terms to fight over.  They are useless labels bandied about while the flame of a wonderful friend's life has been snuffed out.  You think he lived and died so people could use pronouns correctly?  That his goal in life was striking a blow for gender grammar?  No.  He was and remains more complicated than that, and by far more important.  Your scorn, no matter how much, is little more than the biting of gnats while my heart bleeds from the knife of his loss.  You can dress it all up with the loaded terms and force your own prejudices into words if you want, but it doesn't change that a bit, and if you want some of my blood, that he appreciated it more when I referred to him as a 'she' or 'her' by accident naturally in conversation rather than some simple mental adjustment to be repeated by rote.  The way it made his eyes light up and a grin split his face...he preferred those moments

  I appreciate all you who understood the intent of my post and weren't led to insensate fury over how I wrote it.  Such wise and loving people are rare to find, have finally come to accept him, even if it is a little late, and that they were moved by my call to give Cora the people in death that were unable to be there in life.  I even appreciate you who both knew Cora Hillbairn and directed your fury my way... for that means SHE (you get one) truly had friends despite feeling so terribly depressed and alone.  

  That's another lesson anyone here should learn if they haven't already... for as alone and lost as you may feel, secure in the choice you've made to become happier.  Don't burn too fast, you have time, you have love, and you are not ever alone.",,False,t5_2r4b9,True

Three weeks ago, like she knew me. I noticed that she had a somewhat prominent brow bone. I wondered if she might be trans, and knew me from my YouTube blog, or something. Once we're out of the bar, I proceeded to ask Julie:

Me: ""So Julie

Julie: ""You mean is she trans? No. You're both into girls

Me: ""Oh, it made me wonder.""

Marc: ""Maybe Kate was into you.""

Julie: ""Well, you have no chance with her, she's just really into girls... Real girls. She's really not into guys. If you even tried approaching her and she found out you were trans, she would reject you.""

At that point, I was guy, not a ""real girl"". I felt enraged.

I then found out that Julie and Kate had a relationship. Maybe Julie was just trying to ""protect her territory"". I let myself forgive her.

Fast-forward a couple hours. I somehow managed to get over my rage. The party had moved to someone's house. Julie and I were sitting next to each other on a couch. Other people at the party were making out, and I assumed she felt the same about me. She was cuddling me. Yet something was off, I could tell, she was holding back.

I asked her if I made her uncomfortable for some reason. She answered very directly, but that she just couldn't conceive of doing it.

""There's just something really weird about the idea of having sex with a woman who has a penis, I don't think I can do it"".

At that point

Three weeks later, but never realized anything was different. Kate's very passable and post-op, what can I say... I blurt out:

""Her surgeon did a very good job!""

Being transgender is the best thing you can possibly be.

It means you have suffered, and you have not been destroyed.  You have accepted yourself, despite the entire world's condemnation.  That is powerful.  You stood up to the entire world.  There are not many people who have done that.  You are one of the few who found love and strength inside yourself, instead of depending on an outside source.  Sometimes this is even directly acknowledged: ""You're so brave,"" is something we are often told by others in awe of our inner strength.

And if you have transitioned, and you know how it each of those hormones affects the way you think and feel.  I've become the ""go to"" girl for hetero-relationship advice, because my experience has allowed me to understand the male and female perspectives better than anyone.  All my male friends come to me for ""girl advice"" (what does this text MEAN?).  My female friends want me to explain why their boyfriend acts the way he does, and I CAN.

There are countless other benefits that come from the transgender perspective.  I find more every day.  I would never give up being trans so I could be just another cis.

I'm curious if this is the majority opinion of trans* people or if many people take the opportunity to educate people.

I'm prompted to ask this question because just a few minutes ago I was at a local food store buying some things to make for lunch and was asked by a cashier ""Are you going through a.... uh... change?... um... thing?"" I frequent this place almost every day, with just me and the cashier within earshot and a manager at the far end of the counter. I laughed a little to put her at ease and answered that yes I was. She proceeded to ask a few personal questions that I know a great many people on here would have felt were too personal. I took the chance to educate her on some basics.

The thing is, very embarrassed to be asking such questions. I try to look at it from their perspective. They get to know their customers on some level, and they have watched my appearance change quite drastically over the past few months. It is only natural to be curious as to what is going on with people you see every day, and to many people, they really do have no idea how such things work.

Given how many trans people are somewhat aware of their feelings when they are young, I think it might be good if it was screened for by school nurses/psychologists as part of checkups in public schools, and part of sex ed curriculum.

Now, this kind of thing wasn't covered, and there were several checkups and sex-ed classes I encountered in public school.

Here's how I'd imagine this could work

Sex ed: At the various points where sex ed is covered, it's not a choice, and there are treatments to make the body match, ask us if you have questions.')

Health checkups by school nurses/psychologists: Added onto the existing health/mental health checkups that happen at various stages in public school, and that treatment is possible. Then they'd ask if they felt that way often, but wouldn't question further unless there were signs of trans-ness.

I thought I was trans, it's easy to start to sell it pretty hard and convincing). Through a series of life changes I was put into a spot where I was able to fully realize what I thought I wanted.

And then I didn't want it.

It wasn't sudden, and you start to panic. I know I did. For the most part this community is great (the entire trans community, not just here on reddit), it really is. That said, there are times when I think there's a bit more pushing, though with great intentions, for someone questioning to just accept it and move forward. I know the intentions are to spare someone the pain of delaying and making it harder than needed, there has to be at least one or two that are confused and exploring. I'm sure the numbers are small and clearly not abundant here since they tend to avoid coming back for one reason or another. It's easy to get swept up in the whole thing when you're sorting this out.

I'm not trans and I know that now. I know the umbrella is massive and encompasses a lot of different groups, in the grand scheme, I'm happy with being male. 

Life isn't easy and gender identity is very confusing. I have nothing but the utmost respect for all of you that are being who you really are. I tried playing for the team for while, but I learned a lot about who I am. It's easy to see this moment as me denying, but that's not who I am. I own things and I'm never one to back away no matter how uncomfortable. I'm sure there will be at least one or two ""you'll be back!"" posts. The future is uncertain, but I feel stronger about this than I have anything else. I'm not one to run away from problems. I owned this and it just wasn't for me.

Things are going okay for me. I’m working towards getting my Ph.D., and I’m talking to my father again. I’m still not out, but I hope to be within the next few months. When I first started dealing with my gender issues, I had a lot of doubt about whether I was trans, and it has been a really complicated process figuring things out. For those who may have followed my posts either from the time I posted, after, or in the future: I now know that, I really am trans.

I want to give some advice to anyone who is questioning. Every trans person’s process of recognizing their transsexuality is different. Some people know they are the wrong sex from their earliest memories. I wasn’t completely sure until I was in my late-20s and 5 months on estradiol. If you are questioning, but everyone is different, trans or cis, and you can make yourself sick if all you do is measure yourself against others.

So how do you figure out if you are trans or not? I can’t give you an answer. I don’t think anyone can. Any specific piece of advice you receive from others on the subject may or may not be helpful to you. 

I will give you one more set of advice

* I can see my self growing old as a gay man
* I find it hard to visualize being an old woman
* Continue being a man seems simpler in the short run than to transition
* I could try being a more feminine man than I am today

Reasons why I am mtf:

* When I look in the mirror I want to see myself having a female body with 
 feminine curves
* In my sexual fantasies I have a female body
* I have no use for my penis and find it incredible that I have been equipped with one
* I have crossdressed in secret all my life
* When alone and frustrated I tend to focus on my genitals
* I used to wish I could be a girl in my teens and seriously considered being transsexual. But
 it was too much too cope with and I settled for gay
* I wish I could wear the clothes I want to, bikinis,

However I didn't take them seriously because they've been saying that for months now. I always told my mom and sister if either of them ever did that to me. That without a doubt I'll cut their hair and shave one of their eyebrows off as well. Last night my mom actually took scissors and cut a huge chunk of hair off the said of my head.

I pretty much locked myself in my room all day crying and won't speak to either of them.

Absolutely nothing.

He had to move the scope a bit back and forth to get it to insert, but he had zero trouble. He did a full visual of the insides all the way up to the bladder and found nothing wrong. No blockages. No scar tissue. Absolutely perfectly healthy. 

As far as we can tell, or whoever it was who tried to insert the catheter in Buenos Aires just fucked up. They screwed up somehow and I ended up with an injury that took awhile to heal. Thankfully at least it seems this left no permanent damage. Whatever they did has completely healed.

Well, when she is on the ship back to England and yells, “PRAISE GOD, I’M A WOMAN” at the top of her lungs.  

All it took to finally break through the wall of repression was dressing like a woman for 12+ hours this weekend.  I secretly borrowed a weeks’ worth of my girlfriend’s clothes while she’s out of the country (for another week or so) and I locked myself in my room and put them on.  There were little flare-ups of sexual excitement but after about an hour the clothes just felt right.  But that’s not when I realized I was trans*.  

I realized I was trans* when I took them off.  

When I took off the bra and went back to boy mode, it’s just like phantom limb, but instead of missing a limb I’ve lost, I’m yearning for the body I never had.  That’s when I realized that this isn’t sexual anymore; that’s when I realized that these are what clothes are meant to feel like. 

That’s when I realized: I’m trans*, I tried for 21 years and that voice just got dealt the killing blow.

And the hilarious part about all of this?  I’m happier than I’ve ever been because I’ve figured out why I’m here on this world: I’m going to be one of the world’s first lesbian trans* superheroes. 

People are killing themselves every single day.  I saw a [statistic](http://www.abajournal.com/news/article/staggering_rate_of_attempted_suicides_by_transgenders_highlights_injustices/) recently that said 40% of trans* people have attempted suicide.  Excuse my language

All of us who are out and proud, and ready to fight are paving the way for anyone is scared to be who they are.  No one is going to die on my watch.  I’m here to soak up the hate so that others don’t have to.  Because I can take it. 

Sure, never underestimate love and friendship.  You never know just how amazing people’s reactions will be.  

Oh yeah

And the best part?  We won’t even have to take it for very long.  If we’re lucky

Ahem.  Sorry.  Like I was saying

Until it finally dries up like an old well: shriveled and forgotten.

I’m readthekeats.  I’m trans* and proud.  I’m one of the first lesbian trans* superheroes.

I tell anywhere between 1-3 dates.  I wait until we're having a really good conversation and really vibing

Then I'll just say it without any hesitation and with a very nonchalant voice: ""By the way, and honestly it shouldn't change anything about our relationship, I just like for my partners to know sooner than later'""  That's pretty much it.  Even if it DOES play a huge role in your life (it really doesn't for me), just say that it doesn't for now so that she understands that she hasn't signed up to be with some guy who is going to be obsessed with it all the time.  You can reveal how important activism is to you later in the relationship.

Also, I personally avoid saying something like ""I can answer any questions you have"" or something like that...you maybe could say this, but for me it sounds too much like a ""let's talk about this a lot"" type thing, and the attitude you're trying to convey is that you just don't care. everything's going to stay the same.  She'll ask questions eventually if she has them.

Really

Edit: I also want to add that (while I have never had this happen) if I did get rejected for being trans, but in a very aloof manner, such as ""I see.  Honestly, I think that's pretty messed up.  It's your decision and I have no desire to be with you now, knowing that this is how you're reacting, but I think it's really strange that you're so caught up in such a minor physical detail.""  The point of this is not to convince her to stay or something--that ship has sailed.  It's to reaffirm YOUR self-esteem and put you in control.  If you act mournful and tell her you totally understand, that you've just been glad to get to know her,  then you will leave the experience feeling like shit.

But I wanted to share this kind of bizarre experience I had that was very outside my comfort zone but ended up being really rewarding in a strange way.  

I’m not an outgoing guy as far as romance goes. I started transition when I was 18 and I’m nearly 25 now and the last time I had sex it was before I was even out yet, and it’s not exactly a place of happiness for me. My body has been my main source of unhappiness for all my life, how can I feel comfortable letting other people see it?

And now, I still can’t help the feeling that my body is gross, unsexy, how could anyone find me attractive, just no. I can barely look at myself below the belt, why should anyone else want to conduct business anywhere in that vicinity?  

But recently I’ve been horny, a biological, cisgender man.  

I should add that I’ve never been with a cis-man before. I had never touched a dick or even seen one that close up, let me tell you. (That’s a joke, BTW. It was extremely traumatic and I immediately had a panic attack.)  

Anyway, what I’m missing. I wanted a man to lay in my bed, take his god damn clothes off, and let me touch him just about everywhere. And I didn’t want him to touch me, because I’m sexless and unattractive and no one wants to be with me because gross. I just wanted him to be my human model so I could get a look at what I don’t have and never will have.  

This semester I “studied abroad

So I went to the same place you always go when you need something strange: THE INTERNET. And it took a few weeks, attractive, interested in trans guys (it’s possible he was a chaser but I really don’t care because I was essentially “chasing” him too), and he told me two key things during messaging before meeting him:  

1.	He would do as much or as little as I wanted and he wouldn’t push or hassle me about it.
2.	He would lay back and let me explore his body.  

Fucking perfect

So long story short, he made me feel really good about it. He *liked* my chest, and he liked what I was doing to him.  

For the record

He left after he came, “Nah bro thank YOU,” and that was that for a few weeks.  

About two weeks ago he texted me again, essentially, “Sounds scary but let’s do it.”  

I threw caution to the wind. I was very scared to let him see me, and the even bigger thing is that I knew, I just *knew*, that I would regret it if I didn’t take this opportunity. So I decided to just do it.  

Well, okay? Just great. I didn’t have an orgasm but that’s ok because even on the best of days it’s hard for me to come, let alone with this relative stranger conducting business near my junk. It still felt fucking awesome and I was still really glad I did it.  

But I think the best thing I got out of this whole experience is that, and they can be nice people! They can be cool people and people with interests similar to mine. I don’t have to be alone forever, as long as I take a little extra effort to put myself out there and meet people.  

So here’s my advice to struggling trans people out there in the lonely stealth world: *Do one thing that scares you every day.* Just do one thing that puts you outside of your comfort zone even just a little bit

Thanks for reading

Okay

Went to a doctor today and got a script for

Medroxyprogesterone 5mg
Is this a normal prescription? I have no idea.

That's the positive event. The whole time the doctor made me feel like shit, that being ftm is easy and mtf isnt going to work well, that he has two ftm patients who look amazing, that he just saw a mtf patient who looked ridiculous. I don't present as female, but kept calling me sir with a fucking smirk. Just... Ugh. Hurt. A lot.

My sister has told my fiancé that she still ""doesn't get it"" my mom and I haven't talked much about me. All in all

I hate this. I just wish I was born happy. That I don't have to go through this. That I'm worth something to my family, and transition happily.

Well tomorrow I start estrogen. Most likely will be injecting some amount of Delestrogen or equivalent based on what my Dr talked about last time. 

I've already been on Spiro for 3 weeks and I've felt effects from that. One of the effects I'm pinning on it is my new extreme ambivalence towards this whole transitioning thing. I'm by no means the first trans woman or man to feel doubts over this and knowing all the stories out there about people who delayed transitioning only to do it later in life have pointed me to actually doing this thing

1369673284.0,1f57vm,It's not about the dress...,mollyfied,53,6,36,"Hi, but I'm pretty sure about this. Let me back up a bit.

Okay, my desire to change my body. That is, I'm interested in transitioning more because it would make my life easier than because I think I should've been born a different sex -- female, to be totally forthright. I mean, I do think that I'd be happier as a biological female, but not for the same reasons I want to transition... I think I need to start over again.

It's like, when what I really want is to just be myself, and that doesn't include any of those things, then I feel wrong. Tense. For me, transitioning is a way to align my body with my mind, and that's another part of the issue. It has nothing to do with a desire to fit into society's expectations of gender -- I'm doing this not to fit in, but to simply fit.

So, confirming that I'm not wanting to ever slink into a dress, and explaining my need for an endocrinologist. It's not a feminine ensemble, but not a masculine one, either. It simply is. Like me.

See, I suppose. And so starting a hormone regimen, and eventually surgery, is the only plan left... or I'm dead. I mean, I don't think it would help to go into my issues with suicide and depression... it might be easier to just say that changing my body is the last thing I'll try to become a bit happier. I don't expect to suddenly be smiles and laughter. I just want to be able to sleep and not hate myself. After trying for my whole life to accept that I own a male body, I think it's time to try another approach and fix it. So I will.

Anyway, not wanting to become a woman in gender, with all of the expected changes, but just be me, more womanly, neutral in form, a ghost with a different shell?

1362261051.0,19jjk6,Inappropriate touching during pat down at club last night :(,DJRabbit,53,6,20,"POSSIBLE TRIGGER WARNING

Hey everyone.  Had a bit of a situation with a bouncer at a club here in canada.  Just wanted to hear from some people that have been in similar situations and if you did anything about it.
I go to this club all the time, I have to pat those down'.  I leaned in and covered my breasts and told him I am trans and he can't do that.  He told me to put my arms out to finish the pat down.  He then roughly grabbed my forms, I feared so hard he may have popped one (thankfully they were fine).  I pulled his hands away and walked past him.  
I informed the lady at the ticket booth that the bouncer had laid his hands on me and she became very serious.  Asked if I was ok and if I wanted a manager to come speak to me.  Kind of in shock I declined and said I was alright
Today it's still bothering me.  Im planning on giving the place a call tonight to speak with someone.  
Anyone had the same experience?  what did you do?

EDIT:  Thanks for the love everyone &lt;3  I'm glad to hear I'm justified in being upset.  I've never had anything like that happen


UPDATE!!  I heard back from the club via email this evening.  To say the least I am blown away and I am feeling MUCH better.  Its an interesting situation.  I have been made aware that the club actually used to be a lgbt club before it became what it is today.  The managers have remained the same and one is actually a drag queen &lt;3  They have asked me to provide more details on the event, feel welcome in the future.

It started out great though. On Friday there was a panel about transgender issues in gaming which was really nice

Something happened today, when during the course of gameplay someone on my team turned to me and asked in a loud voice: ""Hey, so why are there so many of you trannies here? It's kind of weird.""

The sad part is that his comment wasn't even the worst part to me. There will always be giant assholes with misguided views; I've come to expect them. I do (or maybe did) think that the majority of people are at least decent.

What really got to me was that not one of the 15+ people around us, as though they were thinking, ""hey yeah why *are* there so many trannies here?"" Then they went back to watching and commenting on the game, or talking amongst themselves.

DOUBLE EDIT!: Ok

IT WAS NOT THE COMMENT ITSELF WHICH BOTHERED ME SO MUCH. IT IS BY FAR NOT THE WORST THING EVER TO HAVE BEEN SAID TO ME NOR WILL IT BE.

It was the fact that I was surrounded by people who heard and tuned into the situation neither recognized nor understood that it was a wrong thing to say. Now why did that bother me so? It was a disturbing illustration about how widespread ignorance regarding transgender issues still is. While yes, to witness a bunch of otherwise good people not react to something bad simply *because they just don't know it's bad*. 

Do I think it's worth E-mailing Penny Arcade about? Yeah

Honestly, the reason I found the scenario to be noteworthy was that until now, I've only experienced ignorance of trans issues first-hand in the form of a single buttwad saying offensive things, never the inaction of a large group, which to me is scarier and more indicative of the underlying problem.

Furthermore I love my country, proudly exercise my right to vote, would happily give blood if I met the exclusion criteria, and can't wait to celebrate Christmas.

1366943441.0,1d4mwc,Finally getting something off my chest.,GremlinGirl,54,10,25,"Hey everyone, see the transitions. This is real. This must be what tears of joy feel like. Literally cannot stop crying. I thought it was just me.

Judging by what I’ve read so far, here’s my deal. This is what I’ve been feeling. 

For so much of my life I’ve been horribly depressed and could never pinpoint a specific reason. I was just sad and slow. Even when I was very young I remember feeling burdened by an invisible force crushing me with the sads. All my life I’ve felt like a space alien and have never been able to figure out why life doesn’t work for me like it seems to work for everyone else. I figured this was just how life was and would forever be for me. A miserable observer always looking in from the outside. I never participated in things because I felt so awkward and out of place. Things just didn’t make sense. Still don’t

I come from a small, but I still can’t shake this feeling of being uncomfortable in every situation. I’m uncomfortable in my skin. 

The problem is, when I told them I’m on antidepressants they said, “No, you can’t be depressed. You always seem so happy!” 

I guess I’m better at pretending than I thought. 

There’s another act I’m good at playing, and there are things I’ve never told to anyone. I’m just naturally sort of private and secretive. It’s just a thing. But what got me to finally do some real soul-searching was, I had sort of a meltdown a few months ago. I was drinking a lot at the time, and one night I sort of lost it. I won’t get into details, but it opened my eyes to the fact that I might have a problem. The next day I went to the doctor. Got on meds. Stopped drinking. Started thinking. Some days I feel better, but mostly still feel generally flat, stagnant, and sometimes pointless. I feel like a ghost. Something’s misfiring in my brain and has been for ages. I’m 23 now and don’t have much to look back on

Anyway, some piece of definitive evidence, I’ve noticed two constants in my life which run as far back as I can remember: I’ve always been prone to depression, And imagining myself as a girl makes me less depressed. It just puts me at ease and feels right. Sometimes I look in the mirror and see my mom. All the girls I’ve had crushes on in the past, I didn’t just want to be with them, I also wanted to be them. I can’t believe it’s taken me this long to put together what seems to be an obvious connection, but because of the society we live in, passing it off as just a weird quirk I’d bury forever. After seeing a therapist for a few months and having read some of your stories here

I’m a girl.

And I’m scared. Scared to death. Not sure what comes next. Coming out to my parents or anyone for that matter makes me sick to think about. I’m poor so I can’t realistically take any steps closer. I don’t even know where to begin. It all seems so impossible. And what has me most worried is… 

What if I’m wrong?

I know none of you can answer this for me. I’m not asking that so much. That’s a question only I can answer. Just wanted to at least share what’s been on my mind and open up a dialogue with people who have stories similar to mine. I’m tired of being alone. Even when I’m with people

They had an ""Intervention"" yesterday which was my mom yelling at me about everything I fucked up in the past, and that taking anti depressants (that were prescribed to me 2 years ago) will fix everything and make the transgender issues go away.

I have been very depressed lately because I have no support from my family. I can't interact with them at all because it always turns into an argument, making it pointless for me to give them any feedback.

They bring up little tiny insignificant problems I had in high school that have no connection to the problems I were facing.

I'm honestly not actually sure when it's best to start doing that, if she had told me right away I could have been thinking of her as a woman with a convenient and ephemeral penis all this time. As it is

She's making an appointment for the psychological evaluation tomorrow, and she has a lot of anxiety, but it seems the longer she takes the harder it will be. What have your experiences been with that process? Also, should I introduce her in the feminine when she is dressed feminine? How long are hormone therapies? Are they very awkward? Does the voice change at some point? She's worried about being too old to develop feminine curves, she's 24. I sincerely think the curves will happen. She's already got a very feminine shape, and women grow in the hips and breasts until we're 30 so I figure she can too. Can you tell me whether your experiences confirm this? She is in film, and is working on coming out within the industry. How has it been for all of you at work while transitioning? What is the most awkward period in the process and what can I do to make it easier? If you can think of any advice, and I really truly love my tranny and wanna take good care of her

I hadn't spoken to her or my close family for at least five years.
In january of this year I attempted suicide and somehow my mum heard about it. She called me and we eventually made up.
I told her about me being trans and that I had been living FT for over 2 years. At first she was shocked as I didn't show any signs when I was younger (guess I was a good liar/actor).

She then accepted me and we satrted phoning each other and she decided that she wanted to meet me

So last Monday evening I received a message from my uncle who had found me on facebook asking me to contact him urgently.

I inboxed him my number and then my Aunt called me telling me that my mum had a heart attack a week ago and slowly deteriorated until she passed away Monday evening.

Obviously I fel to the floor in floods of tears and pain

I'm not allowed to sit in the limo with my other siblings
I asked for a lock of her hair or a small amount of her ashes

I'm filled with so much rage

No one has phoned me since the initial call or text me to tell me what is going on. I don't know where she is resting now

I'm absolutely distraught. On top of that I'm divorced and I have the kids staying with me this week ( they are special needs ) and I'm exhausted. My dad who is divorced from my mum since I was 2 years old hasn't given me a hug oir even asked how I am

I'm so alone and I'm completely fucked up


Edit: I've now found out that my mum has 60k Sterling in her bank account. It's been a couple of week since her death now and my sister spoke to me during the first week of her passing and has now gone back to completely ignoring me. My uncle who was sending me messages through facebook has now disabled that feature and I can no longer talk to him. So I have been completely cut off from the family.

So I need some advice. There are 5 siblings including myself. My mum was divorced and there is 60k left in her account.

830 PM Sunday April 15th: made it through security. Made it to the plane that will take me to BA.
I'll give further updates as things progress.

1 PM Monday, no problems. Got picked up from the airport, met Amanda, Dr. DiMaggio's main patient aid, she's awesome. Here are some shots I took of the apartment, right in the middle of downtown Buenos Aires:

http://imgur.com/a/W93U3#0

2 AM Wednesday, met for coffee with another FFS patient, a stand-up comic from New York. After this, went to get my heart checked with a cardiologist. 

Finally met with Dr. DiMaggio in the early evening. We talked a lot about the procedures, but he will do as best as humanly possible with my bone structure. Still, what he is doing will shift me permanently into the feminine range. Once this all heals up, I don't envision being able to pass as a guy unless I dropped my pants or summoned up my old deep scary guy voice. :P So dramatic feminization will be possible. 

In terms of the health checks, only does 1-2 operations per week. Still, I trust him. He's been doing this for 20 year, originally studied in the US. He's done over 5000 reconstructive surgeries over the years, of which about 750 were trans women like me. He's literally one of the best, most experience doctors on the planet. I'm comfortable putting himself in my hands.

He said I was really nervous and needed to relax. Ordered me to sleep well and get a lot of time out walking around tomorrow. Gave me some Xanax to help me sleep lol. Tomorrow (or I should say later today), is literally like 6 blocks away. I'll go walk around there. While there, I'll also go reconnect with my Catholic routes. I'm no where near as active as I used to be, but I was raised Catholic. I'm still spiritual, if not religious. I plan to go visit the 300 year old national cathedral and spend some time praying for my partner back in Houston, the trauma he's going through with the recent passing of his uncle, and for success in my own imminent operation. 

6:20 AM Thursday, will post later. I leave in a few minutes, but so far all is well. See you on the other side.

10:30 AM Friday

9 PM Friday


11 AM Sunday, got the first good night sleep since Wednesday night. The pain medication is effective. I've been able to remove the plugs from my nose, so now can breathe a bit through there. 

I still have bandages on. In the hospital, but the swelling has gone down dramatically. Right after surgery, I couldn't even open my eyes. Now the swelling has gone way, way down. 

My strength is recovering. I barely ate anything in the hospital. Hurt too much to move the jaw. Yesterday I had a nutrition shake, and just wanted a lot of ""comfort"" food to have after the surgery. So I brought a lot of box macaroni, spaghettios, peanut butter, etc, just stuff that is easy to make, goes down easy, and some of the empanadas I had before surgery were amazing. Still

So overall, watching movies and shows I have on my laptop, and wandering through Argentine tv until I find an English-language movie with Spanish subtitles. 

1:15 PM Sunday

http://imgur.com/a/VIt8p#0

These are the photos I took Wednesday of the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral. I'm certainly not the most religious person in the world, I had to go check it out. Maybe not your cup of tea, but if you like classic religious artwork, take a look.

6 PM Wednesday

The swelling is slowly decreasing. As of Wednesday, but mostly it's yellows instead of reds on my face. Things are healing nicely and so far no real complications. 

Friday, just a few thin bands left. There's a fair bit of yellow left, but everything is healing up well. Tonight, 5000 miles from home, I had dinner at Burger King. T_T

9:30 PM, and playing tons of minecraft. I've watched all the way through Avatar the Last Airbender and am 2/3 done with Deathnote. My mega-build in minecraft is near completion as well. Getting plenty of sleep as well. I have five days left here. My flight leaves at 9 PM on Friday night and I arrive at 7 AM on Saturday morning. I met with Dr. DiMaggio one last time on Friday. He's leaving on some trip, probably for the May 1st holiday, so that's the last I'll see of him. On Wednesday I will meet with one of his associates for a final check over. Make sure everything is healing well. If it's healed up enough, they'll remove the stitches from my scalp. If not, I'll just keep them in for another week or two and have them taken out by my doctor back home. Later in the week, I'll post my first after pictures and also make a post on youtube. 

11:40 PM, but it just looks like I have a large jaw. I no longer look like I got in a street fight. :P Yesterday, on Wednesday, I met with a doctor one last time. They removed all of the stitches from my forehead and nose, and probably half of the ones from my mouth. The remaining mouth stitches will slowly dissolve. 

This is my last night in BA. It's been a wild ride. Tomorrow Amanda will take some final after pics, art, and culture to explore, and my only regret is that I've been able to see only the tiniest glimpse of it. Someday I shall return when I'm not burdened by a huge medical procedure. 

Finally


Monday

Monday, especially the front, I still look pretty jacked up. The biggest difference can be seen in the forehead and nose. The chin/jaw are swollen up a ton, and as such are actually currently larger now that before surgery. -_- Oh well, the swelling will go down in time. 

With that, feel free to message me. I'm happy to answer them.

Thanks!

[I've started a new account. Freya is my chosen name and the Freed part means that I have finally freed the woman that was stuck inside the artificial male prison I had created for her

Here is a short timeline of the last month:

* 14 jan - Created this account initially meant as throwaway. Questioning gender identity. 
* 15 jan - I learn about people who consider themselves ""bigender"" or 'dual gender'. I start identifying with the term because it seems to fit.
* 22 Jan - I finally accept that bigender doesn't fit. There no male part of me that isn't artificial. I realize I'm transgender and start wondering about transition.
* 23 Jan - I decide I'm going to transition. I come out to my psychologist and she provides some good support.
* 24 Jan - Came out to my mom. She's very accepting and we discuss whats next.
* 31 Jan - I come out to my father and little brother. I don't tell my sister yet because she's not living with us. Everyone seems accepting.
* 12 feb - I start exercising like mad so I can be as healthy as possible when I start HRT. Hoping it will also give me a nice figure.
* 17 feb - After realizing it's going to take way to long to get doctors to prescribe me hormones I decide to DIY and place a small order for spiro and estrofem.
* 21 feb - I get an appointment for a consultancy with a local laser hair removal place.
* 22 feb - I sign up with a specialized hospital that helps transgenders in the Netherlands. As expected I am informed that I am on a 14 month waiting list. I also finally decide on the name Freya and start identifying online as such. Feels like things are progressing nicely so far. Soon I hope that my body will match how I feel inside.

1317550347.0,ky9by,"Today, my parents are going to read a letter I wrote to them. In it, they'll find out they have another daughter.",TheAllBeing,48,25, I look forward to a very anxious day at work. I've Never been more nervous. Any words of encouragement or advance on how to handle the whole coming out situation would mean more than you know. Here's the letter I sent to them:

Dear mom and dad

I wanted to write you this letter to address some concerns you may have had about me lately and to explain things more clearly. You’ve known for awhile that I’ve had some issues with depression since I was young. I know that, and I can’t tell you how much it means to me that you care so much for my well-being and happiness. I want nothing more than to make you proud of me. I feel very supported and am glad to have you as parents; I couldn’t ask for a better father and mother.

I’ve been wanting to write this letter for some time now, I’m feeling very happy for the first time since I can really remember. I have finally found a treatment for my depression that actually works, and I must say that it’s wonderful to feel like life is worth living. I know that must sound depressing, that I thought life itself was somewhat meaningless, but that’s what I was feeling. I felt like I was only alive because I happen to not be dead yet. Horrific, I know. I look back at how I was and how I viewed my life, and I am amazed (and frustrated) that I was carrying such a burden. I still may have plenty of struggles, and in doing so now believe that my life can be full of happiness and meaning.

It’s the specifics of what has made me feel so much better that I write this letter to you now. I’ve had to build up the courage to tell both of you, and as the years went by this fact became more and more apparent. After several years of questioning and trying to overcome my denial, I am now confident in saying that I am not a man; I am a woman. I may have been born a male, but I don’t truly identify as one. It feels wrong, and this feeling has caused me great difficultly and confusion for much of my life. I want to live my life as a woman. I see myself as a woman. I tried very hard not to believe that this was true—that I could just be a “normal” person—but as time went on it became clear that I was just fooling myself. I was scared of what it meant to be this way. However, this has been a part of me since I can remember, and embracing it, has made me feel right with myself. I know now that this is the only way I can live and enjoy my life. This is who I am

I wanted to write this letter to give you time to think about this so we can talk more clearly about it when I next come home. If you need, but I hope that you can accept me for who I am and love me as a daughter instead of a son. I love you both very, very much, and no matter how you take this news, I will still be thankful for all that you have given and taught me throughout my life.

**Edit 1:** On my break reading all the comments. Thank you so much for the words of support. Makes this shift easier to get through. 

**Edit 2:** I just got off the phone with my parents. They said they fully support me as long as I'm happy. My mom had a couple questions about my name choice and a few little things. She also said it was good to hear me cry a little,"" and I just couldn't stop crying. I was so happy to hear that. She seemed relatively comfortable with everything.

When I talked to my dad, and he named me after himself. I imagine it's going to be very hard on him, but it seems like he's trying.

Thank you

I never really get to talk to other trans people

As for me: I was born in, But it made things a lot worse. Dropped out of school at 15. I was supposed to be home schooled, But I wasn't.

Wound up sitting around my room on my computer for several years, And instead of using it for college, I just used it to fund living expenses. At this time, I started DIY HRT. 

Then a small Hobby shop opened near my home and I started going out more. I'd get into card games and D&amp;D and everything. It gave me an outlet to be a lot more social. About a year or so later, And wandered into the shop again. The owner was having some problems keeping it running, So he offered to sell it to me for about the amount of money I still had. So now I have a job, I'm getting closer to coming out, I've got far more friends than I ever had before, And I'm dating a boy nearby. All in all, I'm pretty happy with life now.

TLDR: I'm a 19 year old business-owning dungeon-mastering Transwoman.

I woke up to some absolutely wonderful news. It's like a punch in the chest. I think it's the worst news I could hear short of someone dying. Everything was going so well. I have SRS scheduled June 15th with Chet. I'm currently putting the finances together. I've been working extra hours at work to save up some vacation time for the trip. I've been doing painful below-the-belt electrolysis for months in preparation for this. Everything is going well. Then this happened. 

I had a question about a potential problem

&gt;I have one medical question regarding SRS you may need to ask the doctor. 

&gt;I had FFS in April 2012. When I had this surgery, it didn't work. They told me the problem was I had a narrow urethra. The catheter caused an internal injury that resulted in painful peeing and urinating various amounts of blood for about 6 weeks after surgery. In the end, they could not get the catheter inserted into the urethra. They had to use a suprapubic catheter, a connection directly from the abdomen into the bladder, rather than through the urethra. 

&gt;Will this be a problem for SRS? I don't know enough about the surgical technique or the exact nature of the problem to say for sure. 

This morning

&gt;Dear Ms.Tanya
 
&gt;The narrow urethra which leads to unable inserting the catheter is definitely a problem for SRS.

&gt;1.Risk for inadvertent urethral injury or urethra-vaginal fistula due to the post-inflammatory tissue especially if the catheter cannot be inserted as the guideline during vaginal tunnel dissection.

 
&gt;2.Due to the post-inflammation/injury of urethra
 
&gt;My recommendation:
&gt;You should consult with urologist to investigate of the competency of urethral lumen (severity of stricture) and also test for the catheterization (at least the size of foley catheter no.14 need to be inserted during SRS).

This is just fucking great. What the hell do I do now? Now I got to find a damn urologist willing to examine a pre-op trans gal's junk. Just fucking great. The one part of my anatomy I hate the most. The part that I've been working tirelessly to have freaking removed! And now I have to have someone poke and prod all over it. God damn it! Where the hell do I even find someone willing to do that?

And what happens if the urologist finds that I just have a narrow urethra and there's nothing to be done about it? Can I just not get SRS at all? Is there any SRS doc that can do the surgery without using a urethral catheter? Or am I just stuck halfway transitioned for the rest of my god-damn life?! I don't know if I could even go on like that. 

Why does this shit have to happen? This was all laid out. It was going to be perfect. My boyfriend and I were gonna go to Chet together. He was gonna be there for me. I was gonna be there for him. I was going to have my SRS

If I wasn't at work right now I would probably be getting drunk. I emailed my doctor

I can't wait, and service providers. 

I've become stealth to a degree. If anyone went through my wallet or phone they might realize what I was

I'm working now, the name I will legally assume later this month. And only because my recruiter was accepting of my situation did this happen. My client doesn't know. 

In a year and a half of hormones, but in the right places. So my body looks feminine, curvy. My hair is natural, just flat, and I don't have issues with hairloss. I look in the mirror and I see no markers or signs of my previously masculine form. 

I feel guilt, and they hide behind male privilege when at work or sometimes even at home.

I feel transphobic, but men sometimes attempting to invade a female space. They use terms like Transsexual and Transgender when they are anything but. Then use their own self hatred as fuel to assault women like me who ""Succeeded."" And recently their presence, their failure where I've succeeded has caused animosity in me. Because I was open about my Trans status people now lump me in with these others who do not pass. 

I'm no more allowed in girls only events then them. Right now the only community I'm not stealth in is the BDSM community

The BDSM community apparently saw me as another one of the slovenly male to female trans girls who wanted someone to feminize them. That was never my goal, told me I was pretty. Then I made the leap from masculine to feminine sometimes scaring even them into realizing I was serious about my desires. I was suddenly a woman to them, but a woman with a penis, and an invader. I became no longer wanted. I noticed people stopped talking to me, they avoided me, they ignored me. I was no longer something they could use. 

Now I'm hiding from it

I'm stealth everywhere but the BDSM community, so I feel guilty. Guilty that I succeeded where others are failing. And guilty that I no longer want to be called Trans, or deal with Trans issues. I feel guilty that I no longer care about my transgender brothers and sisters. 

I feel guilty that I've found a place in this world for myself when others are having issues just getting the medical care they need. 

TL;DR : How am I supposed to deal with the guilt felt by being stealth when I know so many others who have tried and failed. And even more who do not even try,False,,t5_2r4b9,1358179309.0,,,t3_16jzw2

You're getting this message because I consider you a closer friend and have something personal I feel it's time I shared with you. All I ask is that you keep reading.

And when I say personal

If you like labels, me.

A good first question would be

Another question I get would be, as with physical sex, is codified during prenatal development. As these two events occur at very different times during pregnancy, they are susceptible to variation by both external and genetic factors. Not to belabour the point, gender identity is far more fundamental and immutable than once believed (though most just take it for granted). It is also quite independent from sexual orientation in case you were wondering. If you want a good book on the subject, I found ""True Selves"" by Mildred Brown and Chloe Rounsley to be surprisingly relatable though the science from 1996 is out of date.

Last fall

Due to the etiology of transsexualism, I have begun to take steps towards transition. I would imagine some of you have noticed changes though been unaware of my underlying motivation.

As I look back on my life, I'm still me and this is largely a body issue. Still, I've grown so used to living with this and come to understand myself in such a profound way that I don't think I'd trade it for anything (though there are days!).

I've chosen to share this with you today because I've finished playing the part. It was an interesting experience but integrity means way too much for me to keep going the way I have been. As more people have come to know me under my new name with the right set of pronouns

I take a risk when I share this so openly but you're worth the risk. Thanks for reading and if you want to stay in touch

Thank you.

Since that fateful day

One year ago, kicked out of my home, forced to beg food and housing from friends, disowned by my own family members, preached at, told I was evil and wrong and disgusting, etc.  But I have never given up.  Much in thanks to all of you here.  

This is my post of triumph over all odds.

I now have my own apartment, and my own car.  I've learned just how loving and wonderful my friends are.  I've paid for a year of schooling, and I'm on track to have plenty to pay for the next four.  I've won multiple awards in my field of work.  My mother is coming around to accept me, and my little sisters and brothers love me (I never really had any conflicts with them).

I've also begun HRT.  I went through three psychologists.  One in my first home who helped me explore myself, but also for me.  My boobs are growing.  My skin feels good.  The buzzing in my head is gone.  

While I'm still scared for the future

So, information, conversation, encouragement, discoveries, etc. that you have given me.  I have had a lot of **very** low moments this last year, and the community here has helped to buoy me through them.

A couple of days ago, but should be within the next few months and would I like for him to make sure my resume gets into the right hands?

Of course I say ""yes, please! Since I know they won't actually be hiring for a couple of months, and since my name will be official in a little more than a month, I decide it's best to just go ahead and use my chosen name. That avoids the issue of having the wrong name on my resume, right?

Oops. I was *not* expecting that!

Ok, right? I'm fairly presentable, I'd guess I pass probably 50 percent of the time, barring close scrutiny. If you spend any one-on-one time with me, you're gonna figure out that I'm trans but I don't ever really try to hide that, anyway.

But there are growing pains.  I feel so inexperienced and naive

One feeling I've been trying to cope with has been getting stronger, but it persists throughout the day like a background hum, growing louder or quieter at times.  It seems tied to one of my physical changes - my skin.  

I'm sure a lot of you have experience with this: One of the first and most dramatic changes has been how soft and sensitive my skin has become (as well as curing a lifelong acne affliction, when I thought it could not possibly get any stronger.  It's radical how sensitive I am now - to the feeling of the fabric of my clothing sliding along my arm, how my car's steering wheel feels in my hands, or holding a pillow against my chest, or brushing a friend's hand as I hand him something.  I feel like all these things are sending shockwaves through me, sometimes too strong - like a sensory overload. Yet I continue to become more sensitive each week.  Don't get me wrong  though - I love this more than anything.  I feel like guys have been cheated in one way, although I change my mind when it's cold or I bump into something in a way that I wouldn't have even felt before, still adjusting as my body changes).

But something else has happened to my sense of touch that is more important.  It creates powerful feelings inside me in all circumstances.  I'm affected emotionally by the shirt I am wearing (this seems ridiculous to me

I feel so connected to other people now - I'm so aware of their emotional state and I want to take care of everyone.  A guy at my work today came in obviously in a bad mood (probably had a fight at home with the wife or something)

And there is the problem.  I still look like a (quite feminine) guy.  All of my friends are computer guys.  I'm a software engineer who works long hours with a long commute at a high stress startup.  No one in my life wants me to be anywhere near them

But I desperately want to touch and be touched.  Badly, and it gets so strong sometimes I can't cope and I have to step outside to cry in my car or cry myself to sleep at night (crying does seem to help some).  I've never felt anything like this before and it has persisted for over two months now, overall getting worse. 

The feeling is so strong I feel like I am starving or dying in some way, and at best I get a kind of guy ""chest bump"" which actually physically hurts a little now (I'm soft and squishy everywhere now - my guy armor fell off), and it's pretty emotionally devastating for me. I try to touch my friends casually sometimes (on the shoulder, or poking them in the back), but I must be really clumsy and weird, because even that has resulted in so many weird and awkward situation, and usually end up feeling so hurt and alone afterwards. 

I hug the few people I can (A friend's mom

Worst of all

I can't talk about this with any of my friends - it's creepy enough for them that their guy buddy is turning into a chick

I was going to just try to wait this out, especially for a boy).  I just don't have the experience to know what this is or what is causing it, but since it has persisted and gotten worse over the last 2 months, I'm asking reddit for help.  I feel like if I have to wait another 3-6 months until I can pass as a girl to get some relief I might not make it (I'm not suicidal at all, this is just an illogical feeling, but I really do feel this way).

My mind is so used to fighting against my body

I have perfectly healthy flesh right now. But my mind has never been content with that. My fantasies have primarily included this phantom vagina that's been there since puberty. Sex with other girls has been about their vagina, and sharing it. Being a part of it, and letting my heart feel what they felt. 

I wish I could somehow be happy with what is there. It made my straight wife happy. I don't want to take the money away from my family. I'm so scared. But like all things dysphoria

I know my social dysphoria was fixed by going full time. I'm more friendly, and happier. I'm just myself around others, without worrying about acting a certain way that others expect. And that is wonderful. 

I so much want the equivalent of that for my body dysphoria. But it's a big, touched a certain way, I can feel it. It's there, in my head, for just a fleeting moment. And that brings me so much joy.

I was curious what sort of explanations you all have used to relate the feeling of gender dysphoria to those close to you. 

One of my favorites:

""It's like being stuck at a shitty part time job. The uniform is itchy and ill-fitting, but you still wind up checking every word and action to make sure you don't accidentally jeopardize your position. Your livelihood is on the line, but after so many years, you've long since forgotten the fear, leaving a dull ache and a diminished sense of presence and worth within the world. Everything emotion feels like it comes from some place far away.""

""Gender transition, more comfortable than you ever knew you could feel after a lifetime spent forgetting how stifled and restrained you had become. There's a sense of immediacy within your own skin, as if you're finally *living* your life, as opposed to directing it and watching it happen to you. You are finally yourself, the same as before, but freed from the thousands of little lies you had piled on to make the days bearable.""

This is for those of you untransitioned in-the-closet transfolk.  I am a 29 year old MTF who has lurked and posted here before when I was scared and alone.  I was recently in a relationship that ended, I tried for years to make transgenderism go away. Doesn't work. Save yourself the time. Take it from me. Now that my second attempt at a family has been destroyed, I nearly did myself in...until I thought about being in the ground forever.

Think about this:

Out there, is a hungry rectangle of dirt. You will most definitely end up there. What are you going to do before the rectangle of dirt gets you? Are you going to waste your precious valuable time being afraid, alone, confused, depressed? Or are you going to SQUEEZE EVERY LAST BIT OF HAPPY OUT OF LIFE?! Don't you deserve it? You will never be able to come back and do it. It's no skin off anyone's ass if you're trans. You fucking deserve happiness. But only you can get up and say, ""fuck this shit, I'm gonna transition!"" No one can do that for you

I recently came out to all my close friends and family. I am a ""128'er""...I present as female everywhere but work for now. Many ppl were okay with but did not want me anywhere near there kids when I was in girl mode. So what? The rectangle is merciless. Have mercy on yourself. You dont know how good it feels to break through and be who you are until you fucking try it.

So yesterday I was silently celebrating a little victory to myself--I was on the way home from going to the movies with my boyfriend

Anyway we were on the trip home. His mom was with us (she knows), ""What Not to Wear?"" 

She said yes that's it, not having all the childhood experience to learn more about it and all the advice that a lot of women relied on.

Now we almost never talk about trans stuff, but being me, victory or not... I mean I had just spent my time at the movies feeling really small because we sat in front of a group of extroverted high school girls who giggled through the movie, some of the other little experiences that I never had that make me feel like an outsider. That's the real difference between me and girls who were raised as girls--I have to KNOW that I grew up in a different social place than them. I have to be conscious of it every second of every day and I always have to ask myself how much of who I am and also how much of what I struggle with is legitimately uniquely me and how much of it is just living an unusual life.

Well today I got bored and I was reading the reddit frontpage, all that stuff. Honestly I'm like the least political person ever, I don't actually know that much about these things and usually I try to ignore them... but something about it just brought all this sadness back to me. Knowing that so many people out there wouldn't accept me or would hate me if they knew I was trans, even as much as or more than I don't accept myself, and as someone who is constantly taking comfort in ""you are your own worst critic,"" that's actually a terrifying prospect.

It's hard to admit but I think that having transitioned has really exacerbated my fear of people. Like, actually most of my friends were girls. Now it is somehow terrifying, and keep in mind I don't get out much, but I feel like such a fake, I feel like I either have to pretend I had a life I didn't have in order to fit in, or out myself to people and live in fear and shame and stigma. After over a year of full time, and a year on hormones, even though I've never been outed as trans anywhere anyway

I feel like I really need to make some new friends and experience the validity of being  accepted as a girl in more than just first encounters with people, so even if I have so many things in common with them CURRENTLY, I don't even want to try. And the worst part is when I feel in over my head. Like I'm not a strong enough person to be trans, like it's just too crazy, like I should have just lived on as an unsatisfied femme gay boy instead.

1318560582.0,lbltg,Came out to my Mormon parents,rockthisbeach,40,2,8,"For the last, so I haven't really been pressed for time.

Anyways, when I received a text. It was from my Dad asking me, ""when did you go see Dr. Derp?"" Dr. Derp is the doc that prescribed, and now monitors my HRT. I've never mentioned him to my Dad. I am, however, still on my Dad's insurance. I put two and two together, and instead of getting that sinking heart feeling, my Dad called and left a message

When I arrived home I instantly started typing a coming out email for my Dad. The dude is extremely stoic, my brothers and sisters and I were all afraid of him. So, calling him was out of the question; I'm too big of a wimp. I gave it my best, and laid it all out in a clear and articulate manner. I explained the science and sociology behind it, my personal trans experience, and that I would still be able to maintain my job, quality of life, I called my Mom. They're separated at the moment. So my strategy was divide and conquer (kidding). I broke it all down to my Mom, etc

He emailed me back the next day. The most positive part of his reply was,"" ""obviously I expect you to dress like a man when you're around me,"" ""mental health issue,"" ""don't do anything that will embarrass me,"" and the real charmer, ""I'm firm in my belief that this is morally wrong"" (with no explanation). 

My Mom called me the next day and was pretty upset. I explained to her that this was my only real option, and she would, and the conversation ended very positively. My Mom and I have spoken every day since. She's really working on developing an understanding of this, and I feel like she's going to be a strong supporter once the initial shock wears off. She's told me a few times that she just wants me to be happy.

I haven't talked to my Dad since. I could not come up with a positive

Overall, it feels like a huge weight has been lifted off of my shoulders. I will say though, it hasn't been easy. The past few days have been fraught with emotions, tears, and despair. But now I'm pulling out of it, and starting to feel okay again. 

Sorry for the long bit of text. I really feel like r/asktransgender has been my number one support system throughout all of this. Not to sound all cheesy (I am still pretty emotional and sentimental), and wonderful people to type stuff back and forth with. Thanks for reading.

**Update 10** (the day after): So I basically woke up to my dad wanting to talk. We had a tough one-on-one where he wanted to know what I did to my wife. He ended up confessing he himself had seen boys at some point and we came to a middleground where I told him I now had to level with my wife. 

We drove to see her and I had a private talk with her; she was very calm and accepting, except now I'm doing it with her knowingly which (to me) is a bit of the strict definition for coming out of the closet.

There were loads of tears and it's been very very stressful. I plan on going on and slowly introducing her to Ophelia's (my) life (i believe she doesn't suspect I carry a name

I really want to hug, the people that commented straight after I posted, and yes, even the people who jumped straight into harsh criticism. Thanks to you I today have a shot at having a comprehensive wife alongside my transition, which to me is the best of both worlds.

And I focus on everything that's wrong now. All the legal and practical barriers that transitioning has created in my life. In my usual consciousness, and suddenly woke up as a groggy and confused adult - only to realize that none of my childhood dreams are viable options anymore, due to these new structural barriers. I get angry at myself, at being trans, at having to transition.

Only when I am reminded of the concrete substance of my past, with disbelief. Still, after all this time. I can't believe that nightmare isn't real anymore. I can't believe that I am actually free to walk away from it now, if I chose to do so. And I do. But as I walk away, I keep turning to look back. It seems I rely on the reminders, the hellish flashbacks, in order to continue justifying my transition.

Because I feel empty. I've spent nearly all of my conscious life fighting with the pain, never had a real social life, never even grew up in the first place. 

I have no family, because I never thought I would still be alive at this age in the first place. Fixing what's wrong doesn't automatically make things right. It makes things not-wrong-but-not-right. I had a traumatic experience with a prominent member of my local trans community and now have trouble trusting other trans people. I don't even know where I can begin to heal. I don't want to be clinging onto fragments of the past just to deal with the emptiness and lack of direction going forward. Doesn't that kind of defeat the whole point?

Even though I was full-time, I have come to terms with who I am, and have felt inner peace that I have never experienced. I am done trying to fit the societal idea of what a woman should be. I'm only now starting to truly be myself. I am a girl, with short hair, I am bisexual (but more attracted to women) I act more girly around my girl-friends and goof around with my guy friends. On the spectrum I would say I am 'femme' but slightly androgynous. None of this makes me any less of a woman. It's not possible for me to ""want to be a girl"". I am one already!

Big relief - slowly the folks are edging towards acceptance.

But we've known for a few months now that my Gran is on the way out - bowel and liver cancer - and I summoned up the courage to go and visit her in boy clothes about six weeks ago and she was really pleased to see me. Again, out of work and in no fit state to start looking.

So now I'm just crawling out of that hole, and I get a phone call from my sister to tell me that Grandma only has a few days left; I'm welcome to visit her in the hospice but only in boy clothes and I will not be able to stay overnight with either her or my parents. My first reaction, out of guilt and a sense of duty, was to book a train ticket to go and visit tomorrow morning. Then I thought about it and chatted to my best friends and really considered how much of a negative effect it could have on me and I really don't think I can do it. I just spent £100 on a non-refundable train ticket, and I'm expecting bad reactions from my sister and mother, like I'm just being the self indulgent and stubborn one and I should be there for the family.

1375234258.0,1je3ah,PSA: Get yourself a bra that fits,ATallWren,38,4,28,"Good evening fellow transsexual ladies


The basics are easy, around the chest, under the arms, pulled tight against the ribs. Bust is across the widest part of the breast, typically the nipples. Subtract (Bust - Band) = Cup Size, A = 1 inch difference, B = 2, see [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brassiere_measurement#Cup_sizes_vary) for the rest. 


How this relates to actually buying bras is that you use that information to size yourself. For example, so I buy bras that are 34Bs. That isn't set in stone however, as for example I can get away with 36s as well, because bras typically have multiple band settings so you adjust them for comfort. Is best to try them on first as well obviously, but if this is not an option for you, the internet has a wide variety of places you can get them. My Amazon Prime account has saved me much money and embarrassment so far by allowing me to test out various clothing styles and cuts in relative privacy.


You will need a tailor's tape for this I recommend [this one](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G7YW7Y/ref=s9_simh_gw_p364_d0_i4?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=09PX4N6MJ7WKEVZRJ2CV&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=1389517282&amp;pf_rd_i=507846). It makes it pretty easy to measure yourself

I guess I wasn't clear enough judging by comments, /r/abrathatfits is a good starting resource I would recommend going to, and I'm sure people there will be able to point you to other resources if you need them.

While he was still slightly drunk, etc. He doesn't have the desire to change the way he dresses. The biggest issues he has is mainly his body hair and the fact that his body is more angular than he feels it should be. He doesn't really care to have breasts, although he said he would be ok with it if he did. He doesn't hate his penis. 

This slightly confuses me because I can't quite wrap my ahead around what to me seems like such minor changes. I do wonder though

Apparently, until he sobered up and really thought about the consequences. Now he's not sure if pursuing HRT is worth possibly losing me. It's flattering, and I will admit mostly what I would like to happen.. but I worry about him ending up resenting me or regretting what essentially feels like him putting my happiness above his own. I'm willing to work on finding a way for him to feel comfortable with himself, whatever that may be. 

We spent the evening fairly normally together.. He even mentioned something about our future children turning out one way or another. I haven't pushed the issue and have just let the situation be what it is. I'm not sure about him

First off

About 2 weeks ago, a full 4 days before Sally started, my replacement, let's call her Ashley, came to our facility and talked with the staff on duty about the new hire, Sally. At this point, there is no way that Ashley could have ever laid eyes on Sally. Ashley used extremely offensive language to describe Sally as transgender. As far as I can tell, it is horribly unprofessional of the manager to tell Ashley this information. So, as these are required to be hired. To make matters worse

Our manager came in on a Saturday, she seemed anxious and uncomfortable, but after a little while seemed to calm down. She later told me she had been asked to move to the men's facility. Sally has also been asked to only shadow at the women's home until they can get her over to the men's facility. Usually trainees only get one day to shadow before they are put on the floor. I think Sally has been asked to not be alone with any of the ladies we serve, which really makes me angry.

I spent all night last night trying to find any laws against discrimination in the workplace for trans people

Sally has no idea any of this has gone on

I guess what I'm asking is

He tells me he's always felt like that but felt he had ""got over it"" and it came back. I feel he should have told me even if that was the case because thats important information to know. Am I wrong to feel really betrayed he got with me and 2 years later springs this on me? This after we've talked about marriage and children and all that.... I even thought he was about to propose to me soon (and it turns out apparently he was about to...). He told me that if he has to repress it he'd kill himself. I didn't even know he was depressed. He's been playing this whole other character with me all this time.... cuz he doesnt even act or seem womanish at all. He's very much - man- as far as I can tell. We have had a wonderful relationship...  he's not gay and definitely no problems in the sex department. In fact its the first relationship I ever had where my boyfriend actually paid so much attention to me in that way. And now he just wants to take that away? I don't even see how we could have a sexual relationship if he gets a sex change. I dont like girls!! I am so straight...  I don't even have a single bi leaning. I know I am not bi or lesbian...

I don't know where to go from here....  i don't know how to be supportive of this. I can't just start calling him a her or considering him as a woman. To me he's my boyfriend. I don't want to break up with him and he doesn't want to leave me either... but how can this even work? I also feel in a weird situation because he mentioned suicide. I feel like if I make any split decisions he might go off himself and then it'd be my fault. I don't want him to do that. I care so much about him but this is so hard to accept.

Dear Mom and Dad

This will not be a very easy letter for you to read and I know that what I’ve written here will change our relationship. I have confidence, realizing that what I’m going to tell you will require more of either than you probably ever imagined you’d have to give.

You know me. I’m a very positive, for about the past twenty years I have hidden something about myself from you and everyone else at all costs. It’s overshadowed every achievement, every joy, haunted me every single day. To the detriment of my mental health I’ve done everything I can to suppress it and failed. As a result and despite how good I’ve become at masking my feelings, I have been very sad most of my life. I’ve only begun to finally feel some joy when I recently stopped suppressing and started facing the truth. 

I’m transgender. Perhaps you’ve never heard this term or you have and don’t know what it means or you have heard it and think you know what it means. None of these possibilities would surprise me, I don’t think you can imagine the agony that this mismatch has caused me.

You may be wondering why I haven’t mentioned this sooner. The truth is I hoped it would go away. When I was going through puberty, I still thought marriage would “cure” me. I remember standing in the shower that morning crying tears of joy and saying to myself, “It’s finally over.” But it’s almost 7 years later and my gender dysphoria has done nothing but amplify. 

I can’t keep living like this. All of my experiences to this point indicate that if I have a “choice” in how I proceed from here, is a big step in that direction, even if it’s the most difficult action I’ve ever taken.

At this point

**Are you crazy?**
Transgenderism is a well-documented phenomenon affecting about 1 in 300 people. It originates in the womb. It does not qualify as a mental disorder, stunts a person’s ability to be happy and successful. It is society – not the mind – that inflicts hardship on transgender people like me who are forced to repress their true selves in the name of conformity. Many repress it their entire lives, leading to true mental disorders like depression and anxiety.

**What does this mean for your marriage?**
Lindsey was the first to know. I told her about 8 months ago. I would never have told her (or you, a woman in a man’s body. Though she shocked me with how well she took it, we nonetheless spent the next few months reestablishing the easy rapport that had existed between us. Prior to my confession, I had convinced myself that our marriage could not weather this storm. After countless conversations, she has shown me how wrong this prediction was. I now know that she loves my soul above all else. Who I am hasn’t changed. Regardless of how I proceed from here, she’s assured me over and over that she’s with me. If you’d like advice on how to move towards acceptance, understanding, she’s the person to talk to.

**How does this affect the prospect of grandchildren?**
Lindsey and I still want children and we want them soon. I expect you’ll have a bittersweet reaction to this news. On the one hand, which is to say, tremendously. Loving two-parent households, regardless of the gender of the parents, are a stable foundation for childrearing. Countless research in numerous cultural contexts has shown this to be true. I’d be happy to provide references.

**What will our friends/family think?**
Unfortunately we cannot control what other people think. If we could, you will be among my most valuable allies. This will require you to reevaluate many of your current attitudes. Keeping this between us will allow us to work through it together without outside negativity.

**How will this affect your career?**
I cannot imagine a better field in which to be transgender. Anthropologists embrace difference. Indeed, fourth, fifth, and even sixth genders beyond male and female. A perspective such as mine can count in my favor on the job market, especially if I eventually wish to contribute to the long legacy of anthropological research on gender.

**Where did we go wrong?**
If your goal was to raise a child to be exactly like you, nurture the child’s interests, and instill positive values that will carry the child through every stage of life. You’ve done nothing wrong. To the contrary, you raised me to have the strength necessary to become the person that I know I am, even in the face of a larger society that will certainly reject me. Because of you, I have the confidence to face this challenge. You have been exemplary parents.

**What happens now?**
I am taking some medicine that over the course of the next several years will subtly feminize my appearance. Ultimately, criticized, scorned. For the most part, I really don’t care what my detractors think. I enter into this in-between stage fully knowledgeable of and prepared to deal with how broader society treats people like me. If you choose to provide it, your continued love and support will be a powerful buffer.

I know there will be more questions. Please feel free to ask them when you are ready to call or write

We are clearly at a crossroads. I am not rejecting you; rather, you are gaining a daughter. My presentation will change and I’ll be happier, but I will remain the same person you’ve always known. You now just know a little more about me and I’ll finally be able to be myself around everyone who matters most to me.

Love

So it's my reddit cake day. I figured I should make a post to celebrate. 

Exactly one year ago today

Then I was 23, working at a job in a new city, and finally coming to terms with my gender identity. The post I made here 1 year ago was essentially the start of my transition, on March 28th, 2011. 

On that day I posted a confused ramble just looking for advice, anyone, to talk to about this. Then and since I've got so much support here I can't express what a blessing this place has been.

Following my ""submitted"" history is almost a timeline of my transition in and of itself

March 28th: After thinking about it for a long time, some underwear from amazon.com. A few days later, I order some estradiol and spiro from inhouse.

April: Start seeing a therapist. Debate between self-dosing and following standard therapy route. Eventually therapist informs me that he only offers hormones after a minimum of six months of therapy. 

Within a few weeks of talking to people, I'm able to find an informed consent doc to prescribe me a legit estradiol and spiro Rx. The doc gives me a low dose of 1 mg estradiol, 100 spiro. Also, in April, first laser session.

Finally, I come out to my parents and brothers, thus beginning a a long family shit-storm which I won't go into unless asked. 

May: Sperm banking. I go on and off hormones (still a very low dose) as needed when making deposits. My gatekeeping therapist strongly disapproves of me taking hormones

June: continue hormones

In June, kind, handsome, an amazing cook. He's been there for me through the hardest, most painful parts of this transition. Don't know where I would be without her. She's my awesome boyfriend. :3 We've been together since June!

July: Meet my family again for fourth of July, continue getting laser. I sheepishly come out to HR at work, begin to plan a workplace transition. In early July, I get a formal psych-approved recommendation for hormones, switch to a doctor more experienced with trans patients. Go to 8 mg estradiol and 100 spiro.

August-September: Things continue. More laser

October: Switch to new doc

November: Everything continues. Through HR

December: 6 month anniversary with my partner. We drive together and spend Christmas with my family. Much

January: I go full-time female. New year, social security agency, health insurance, banking info, etc. In January, firmly decide to do FFS and select a doc for it. Begin putting together finances.

February: hormones

March: more of the same. Put last of finances together for FFS. Almost get a really awesome job at another company. Would have come with a huge pay increase
And to come:

April 15th
April 18th
April 19th

So yeah, financially draining, physically painful, and a dozen other things. At the same time, it's been wonderful, joyous, and made me really start to feel like myself for the first time in my life. 

I suppose I should post some photos. 

Here are some current ones:

http://imgur.com/a/fKqTa#1

Sorry they're a bit rough. I need to do my eyebrows again, and I even have hair grown out for electro. This post is a bit of a last-minute thing, these are just some pics I snapped now. The last pic is from early march and is what I look like shaved, some makeup on, and decent hair.

And finally

So yeah, inspiration, and friendship. I just want to say wherever you are in your journey, keep at it. You can get there. It's a long, hard road, but the destination is definitely worth it!

TLDR: OMG I HAVE BOOBIES!

“What does she have that I don’t?” from even before my transition, reinforced by the media, an image that definitely not me. So even after I started ‘full-timing’ I was not sure I ‘passed’(1), and even if I did ‘pass’ I was certain I was ugly and not worth noting. I was constantly obsessed with my appearance, mirrors who were my enemies up until a few weeks before were now my greatest friends. I would not be surprised if almost all trans people have similar feelings.

This neuroticism about my appearance lead to a need for gratification, therefor anyone who said I was pretty was lying to make me feel better, therefor I was ugly. It took me several years until I managed to beat the cycle and realise that my opinion was entirely incorrect.

So my view of beauty, big eyes and a petit chin. Which leaves me the 5’9.5” girl with a prominent nose in a right state. I was convinced because I was not like the average that I was abnormal, masculine and unattractive.

Now my situation gets rather ideal at this point, where as my face and height were both worthy of note and made me a more interesting and attractive person. Height as an example, is something that many trans women fear but most cis women covet.

The point of my rant isn’t that we are all attractive, self confidence that won’t be gained back until you realise that your envy does nothing.

Even if you don’t look cis, not external gratification is probably the best deterrent of suicidality and self-doubt. If you help yourself and your confidence you may realise that everything else will come to you.

I hope that some people find that they can get something out of my ramblings and it did not come off as too preachy

Anyway

Not only does she do an amazing job of encapsulating a lot of challenging topics, gawking at her brilliance. At the beginning of the book she gave the caveat that her main focus was going to be trans-misogyny, and I was worried that the book was just going to be an invective against *discriminators*, but instead she geniusly framed gender, sex, and society in rational and meaningful ways to give an invective into the many and often subtle ways we are *discriminatory*. Her insight was powerful: I was able to see a lot of my own hidden prejudices come to light without feeling like she was indicting me for being a terrible oppressor, and, I feel like it gave me a genuine window into the trans experience.

My partner was a total hearthrob who asked me to dance with her at a queer party. We danced rather closely for quite some time and then took a break. I got the impression she had read me as trans since (a) she had already felt up my pretty ridiculously small boobs and (b) at least half the people at the party were trans.

I decided just to go for it:
""So

To which she replied

""I mean

""I don't care; I think you're cute.""

And that's pretty much how things happened.

that it shrinks things down there and I love the fact I don't get random boners or 
boners ever unless I want to. Oh and how I love that it gives me smooth soft skin
and how my face feels without stubble. 


I love the way my thighs got fat and of course my boobs
having a hairless body. I love how happy I am all the time rather than that sullen and 
angry feeling from before. I love that I feel content. 


I love doing simple girl things like taking a warm bath
just the right shoes or spending hours trying on new outfits while mixing and matching to 
find my style. 


And I love that feeling I get when people see me as my true gender or when a guy give me a
second look. Or a random girl on the streets tells me she likes my shoes and then stops to chat. It's
like a warm hug that lasts all day. In short I love everything about being a woman. 


But I'm conflicted
Is it possible that Estogen has tricked us/me into feeling good about all these
things? Is it just a ""happy"" drug that works for everyone TS or not?

I sat down with my HR manager, so just came out with it.

I cannot express how incredible this woman was. She didn't change how she looked at me. She didn't question ""Are you sure"", and gave me the most wonderful hug. 

She has been my aspiration in terms of where I want my career to go for a long time

I wanted to post this as something that could hopefully inspire and encourage others who are worried about coming out at work. I know the fear

I still need to tell my parents

TL;DR? I came out to work. They were beyond supportive and happy. I feel like I finally have a weight lifted off me. ",,t5_2r4b9,1372351831.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1h6rmw/just_came_out_to_my_work_and_feeling_hope_anew/

I just... I can't see myself. In photos

I was really suicidal and depressed for a long time, and overall don't control my thoughts. 

Everyone sees me and tell me I look so happy and so photogenic and overall not a miserable piece of shit. But ultimately, and I'd never act on these horrible thoughts I think. If I wouldn't be found by an immediate family member, I fear I'm not so sure...

It just hurts. I hurt. I just want it to stop. I explain all this to my very few friends and family. All I get in return is a ""It'll get better"" which drives me crazy. I don't want a solution to my problems

I have worked on my voice for SO. LONG. Over a YEAR. For a while I was practicing it several hours a day, and asked my family what they thought. Everyone sugarcoated it and told me my voice sounded just fine.

Then I go online and use it and get made fun of. People interrupt me when talking and tell me that I'm obviously not a girl. I go on another trans forum that isn't as ""nice"" (I don't think lying to people really is nice) and get told I essentially sound like an effeminate gay guy.

I am so fucking tired of this. I am so tired of voice practice. I'm tired of getting no where with it. I don't even want to talk anymore. I've been upset for 3 days now because of this

FUCK TESTOSTERONE. God fucking damn it why can't I just sound like a cis girl? If I had started just a few years earlier I wouldn't have to worry about this bullshit and I might even have a halfway female-looking body to go with it. But no, even if I started at that age.

I've been living full time as male since late 2010, deep voice and a binder on all the time, and I fairly obviously/confidently express as male (for me personally - totally not trying to enforce stereotypes or anything.) 

Mum's first reaction was to inform me I had no right to expect they would even try to get male pronouns and my new name right

He was diagnosed with prostate cancer around 5 years back

I want to be there for him as any good kid would - he's a nice guy, who appear to support me the least. But I wonder if I'm being incredibly selfish, seeing as it's dad's time of need. I don't know. I just realised that he's going to die having never recognised me as his son, or treated me as such. He's probably never even going to use the right name or pronouns. I know it's not that important in the grand scheme of things, but best case scenario, being with him for his remaining time is going to set off major anxious and depressive issues I have. Again, I know that sounds selfish. I hate myself for it, but maybe not. I don't know.

Thanks for listening

Edit: So I've decided to share a bit more about what's happened in the past with my family. I should probably make a separate post for all this (there's a fair bit) but I didn't want to clog up the page with related posts. I hope someone reads this - it's all just coming out at once

I spent most of 2011 in an abusive relationship. Emotional, but our problems arose from issues other than my being trans. When we broke up (I got sick of the condescension and splashed a drink in their face - they'd punched me before, out of 'reflex' but also when we wrestled or if I startled them - never apologised). They are powerful and well known in the queer community, and told everyone they could that I was the violently abusive one. I lost most of my friends, and a lot of the older queers I looked up to told me I needed to be fixed, and was an abuser. The ex admitted none of the things they did. I owned my outburst and apologised. Long story short, I ended up staying back at my parents' house for about two months at the start of 2012 because I lacked the finances to move out right away. My parents wanted to help out, all that material stuff. My mother has said on multiple occasions that 'demand' (her word) that they use the right name/pronoun is selfish and that I shouldn't expect it - they'll get it when they were ready. I accepted, because I had anxiety issues related to aggressive situations. He asked why, telling me I was a thing

At another time, after dealing with the traumatic breakup from my ex before my brother did - I just wanted to have it to myself for the first little while. She said it was no wonder my ex was abusive - I told her that she had no right to comment on that, and she told me I deserved it because I was clearly a horrible person. She never apologised.

Dad has shrugged before when I brought up the issue of abuse after I was almost bashed by a homophobic asshole at a friend's gathering - he said that I was selfish for not telling them about it right away, and when I said I hadn't told her about the attack because I wasn't sure how they'd react (couldn't deal with them suggesting it was my fault, as they have for most times I told them someone had mistreated me in my life, childhood and all), and she cried, telling me that I clearly hated them, and implied that I was an ungrateful and deluded person.

I'm sorry for ranting about all this. I'm just now starting to process this all,,False,,t5_2r4b9,1361642125.0,,True

Along with my constant email battle I've had with my mom, I kind of just went on a rant about how mom had no intention of accepting me and how she would prefer I just lie to her for the sake of family appearances. I kind of played it off like it was a religious squabble, but my mom was actually pretty understanding in that area and I needed to vent my frustration. 

So

&gt; ""Mom

&gt; ""What are you talking about?""

So skip a little context and now my sisters know.

***AND THEY'RE THE BEST SISTERS EVER!!!!***

From helping mom get over her grief, wanting to go to PFLAG themselves, wanting to buy me new christmas presents because the last ones sucked (their words, not mine), wanting to come down for a few days and visiting me just to hang out as sisters, using proper pronouns and calling me sis, possibly get a pedicure

I was literally rolling around on the ground grinning from ear to ear I was so happy. 

It's just quite a breath of fresh air compared to a few weeks ago, but I'm not presenting EVER, I don't look very feminine at all, my girls voice is atrocious and needs help, and I don't know. I want to do all these things with my sisters but my body just isn't right yet.  I'm probably just making excuses and need to just go have fun, but it's going to be my first outing with people who want to see the REAL me and I'm just not comfortable yet. Basically I've been on 9 months of medical transition and I'm still at the starting line of social transition and if you know my situation, you would know that it would be dangerous for me to move too fast in that area.

Over the years, attempting to claim me from an equally unknowable god. So I renounced my religion at age 12. Shortly thereafter, I came to understand it as a sexual thing, important to conceal but ultimately harmless.

Things got more complicated as I discovered that I didn't enjoy heterosexual sex; more often then not, as much as I desired them, sex and relationships with other people were not for me.

Over the next several years (I'm 28 now), and figured I would just do my best until then.

Well, I quit drinking, I've lost 60+ pounds and I'm about to start HRT. Yay.

When I was closeted, all love legitimate, etc.

Well, and he's all the family I have (mom died of ALS several years ago). All I did was shave my beard and get my eyebrows done! But then, sometimes I paint my nails and so I can totally understand if the closest thing I have to a support system feels the need to undermine me at every turn.

The trans dude at the clinic I'm going to mentioned an organization through which I could get cheap therapy with a gender specialist. At the time,"" or some such shit, but about a month ago I sent him an email saying that I'd changed my mind and I really needed someone to talk to. No response. So I called the organization he had mentioned myself, asked for a gender person and finally had my first appointment a few days ago. It is incredibly apparent that I'm the first trans person she's ever met, let alone the first she's ever treated. So cool. I got to teach Trans 101 for the assteenth time, and I paid money for the privilege of doing so.

I don't know. Unless something was horrifically wrong with my blood work, and I suppose that's what I'm doing here. I'm not just confused, I'm utterly lonesome and sad as fuck as well.

Here is some background info if you need it.
I am trans-female
I've attempted DIY transitioning for a year, and would have to miss a whole month of my medications when I could not handle the costs.

I found out my new insurance will cover these costs, despite my telling him I've been attempting HRT for a year now, and have carefully considered transitioning for 6 years now. Then he put me on 100mg Spironolact x2 daily, and 1mg estradiol once daily. Then as I left he said he'd see me in 6 months..

I thought ""Ok fine

So it's been 6 months now

* He would never increase the estradiol I'm taking

* 1mg is what is given to women on menopause because that is how much is needed for anyone to get the same estrogen levels of a female

* Blood tests are useless and not needed (I have not received a blood test order from this doctor yet) because it only shows my hormone levels

I already think I will be getting a new doctor

* Is it really that hazardous to take more than 2mg?
* Does what he says about blood tests hold any truth?
* Is it even possible to reach female estrogen levels off of 1mg for a male body?

My doctor sounded pretty creditable when he talked about this, though I'm sure he may be very mislead.

Also, I was wondering Does anyone know anything about shortened life expectancy on hrt, especially for transgenders?

1363888723.0,1aqu2z,Info my trans endo told me,iama_username_ama,44,12,42,"I went to see an endo in Boston who specializes in HRT. Here are some things that he told me
This is all MTF specific

1) Spiro is a VERY safe drug. It has been widely used since the 60's for blood pressure. The ONLY verified side effect is that ""if you are prone to heart disease and you take spiro, so it is not a ""side effect"" per se EDN_EDIT 

2)  EDIT: Sorry
No one has studied trans women and the effect of HRT

3) Premarin works just as well as Estradiol for feminization. Premarin is generally easier to find in pharmacies so it was prescribed more. Estradiol is MUCH cheaper and so my doc now prescribes that. Again

3) one group will tell you Premarin is ""linked at animal crulety"" and the other will tell that estradiol is ""an unnatural chemical"". They are both very biased. For me I would rather pay 10$ then 50$ so estradiol it is. 

4) Spiro lowers both T and E. The male range for E is actually almost the same as women. Mostly we take E to counter the effects of the spiro and to bring it up ""a tiny bit"".

5) There is no link between any particular part of HRT and risk of blood clotting (except smoking, but we dont know what factors increase or decrease that risk. There is no evidence that any particular type of E , way of taking E or anything else has a measurable difference in clot risk END_EDIT.

6) Neither Spiro or E pills are ""hard on the liver"" that's total internet myth. The only risk of liver damage comes from clots. 

7) Pills (and patches) are better for you E levels then shots. Shots product a large spike and then a dip, I cant provide evidence to back it up. That being said this came from a doctor with decades of treating MTFs and FTMs, so it comes with a little more weight then 1 persons experience. Still, this should be treated as not verified EDN_EDIT 


8) any amount of breast growth is potentially permanent

1363368642.0,1aczli,"I just made the switch from pills to injections and I'm going to document my progress if anyone is interested (long post, skip to bold parts for basic info)",,35,4,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1aczli/i_just_made_the_switch_from_pills_to_injections/

I've been on HRT for just over 2 years, my breasts got to about tanner stage 2 or so, my face changed a little bit and that was about it.

1 year to 1.5 years was probably the biggest let down so far, I switched to cyproterone acetate (Siterone from IHP) and it nuked my T levels within a week, with profound effects on my sex drive and sexual function.

Within a few months of switching to CPA, I noticed a change in my body shape - I have a lot more fat in my thighs/hips and on my butt now. I also put on weight in the last few months, but all of it went to my lower body and none of it went to my breasts, which really sucked.

So far, my nipple and areola are very puffy which makes them look odd, and they are very far apart on my chest. I really can't stand going out without a bra on because the conical shape of my breasts becomes very apparent - my shirt will fall flat against the middle of my chest, making my breasts look really odd. If I'm going out, I will wear a padded bra with even more padding to lift my breasts and push them more towards the middle so my breasts look rounder than they really are.

**Now to the point**, which is switching to estradiol injections. I plan on documenting my progress on them, with pictures of my breasts every week or so, as well as detailed info on how I'm feeling.

For anyone interested

* 0-1 month: 1mg Estradiol
* 1-2 months: 2mg Estradiol
* 2-6(?) months: 4mg Estradiol
* 6(?)-11(?) months: 6mg Estradiol
* 11(?)-13 months: 6mg Estradiol
* 13-17(?) months: 6mg Estradiol
* 17(?)-24 months: 6mg Estradiol
* Now: 20mg Estradiol Valerate every 2 weeks

The reason I made the switch from Spiro to CPA is that the Spiro was not properly suppressing my testosterone levels. The last blood test I had while on Spiro showed that they were in the 200 range (I forget what unit was used). The female range was much lower

Some info about where I got my meds:

* Estradiol pills: generic, and I think they were micronized beta-17 estradiol, not estradiol valerate
* Spironolactone pills: generic
* Cyproterone acetate: generic brand Siterone
* Estradiol valerate: unknown brand
* Prometrium (micronized progesterone): from Wal-Mart. $48 per 30 x 100mg pills - I did not stay on progesterone because it messed with my mood way too much and was far too expensive (almost $50 per month..)

**Yesterday, the price was a little over $50 with shipping. Because they don't ship to VA, I had to have my aunt in Indiana ship it to me. (reshipping is technically illegal, but so is ordering from overseas. I don't really worry about the legality of it, especially since I have a prescription for this stuff)

As I said I plan on documenting this as well as I can

**My goal:** Tanner stage 5 breasts (round shape, and an [inframammary fold](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inframammary_fold) below the breast. The actual cup size doesn't matter to me, I'd be fine with an A cup as long as they look like they are done growing. I'd say if I were to pick a cup size, anything bigger than a C would probably look too big on me. A C cup would be perfect, a B cup would be awesome, and an A cup would be fine. I am small framed anyway :P

**Questions I'm sure will get asked**:

* Did you try taking progesterone? **Yes
* Did you ever try taking your E sublingually? **Yes
* Have you thought about using patches or gel instead? **Yes


**Now** to start the documentation :) If you'd like to follow my progress

* Day I started on injections: Thursday
* Starting dose: 20mg (.5 ml) once every two weeks
* Injection site: outer butt

Due to the high concentration of the solution I'm taking (40mg/ml)

Info about my breasts before starting injections:

* Large gap between them naturally
* Nipple is small but the areola is large and puffy.
* Breasts aren't aching or itchy
* Aching/itchiness hasn't occurred for over a year
* Conical shape
* Tanner stage seems to be between 3 and 4
* Cup size seems to be about an A cup. I can wear a B cup bra but I can't completely fill the cups of the bra because of my breast shape. The bra I wear is a 36B with lots of padding. If I want to wear a low cut shirt
* The right breast (your right) is bigger than the left one
* Breast ""width"" is very small
* No growth within the past few months. The last growth spurt I noticed was right after switching to CPA
* Internal mass feels like a large ball of tissue which is smooth
* [Pictures (front and side views)](http://imgur.com/a/LQWbg) - side view really shows how conical they are

**Day 1 (day before making this thread)**: Injection went just fine

**Day 2 (day of making this thread):** Mood went back to normal mostly. The injection site feels a little bruised but isn't very painful. This is a sign that we did the injection correctly. Other than that

**Day 3:** Morning: Nothing new to report right now.  
-------Evening: Mood is shot

**Day 4:** Morning: Nothing new to report other than that my mood is low like it was the night before. I feel miserable right now
-------Afternoon: I plucked the hairs on my upper lip
-------Evening: My nipples (not the areola, I noticed the upper part of my left (your right) breast now looks bigger!

**Day 5:** Evening: Nipples are still very tender, this Saturday, and today. I ended up puking because I drank so much fluid and my body could no longer process it due to a back up. Urine tests showed nothing, though, which means either something odd is going on, or I had a kidney stone and passed it and I'm simply having post-kidney stone issues with my UT.

**Day 6:** Same as before, before I was getting a little acne and I'm not sure why, now it's dry to the point of peeling. I think what happened was my skin became drier and the acne stuff I've been using dried it out to the point where it feels like I have a very mild chemical burn :/

**Day 7:** Nothing new going on today

**Day 8:** Nothing new other than my testicles seem smaller, die! D:

**Day 9:** Still nothing new to report.

**Day 10:** Nipples aren't aching anymore. My mood seems fine so far

**Day 11:** I felt like my levels plummeted

**Day 12-17:** Nothing new to report :( On Days 16 and 17 I hit a pretty bad low emotionally

**Day 18:** Happy Easter :) Took injection #3

**Day 19/20:** Sorry I've been kinda late updating lately. Nothing new other than that my skin seems a little different in my face

**Day 21-25:** Sorry again for not updating

**Day 26-?:** Still nothing new to update you all with. I'm going to stop doing daily edits until something actually changes.

Our niece does not like living with her mom since she has problems related to her unmedicated bi-polar disorder and tends to get violent.

The niece came to visit us recently and came out to us and told us that she wants to be a boy and to change her physical appearance and gender. We're worried about the environment that she's in. Her mother is very religious and coming out to her as being a boy would not go very well. 

Coming to terms with a less-than-common gender and sexuality situation is difficult enough without the family issues she has. We think that we can provide a much better environment for her to discover who she is and who she wants to be

A little background - 

I have three children, and we try to be very open and honest with them.  We live in a small town in New Hampshire where everyone is pretty much the same - straight, white, and Christian.  I'm pretty sure we only have one non-white person in town.  My husband and I are very  open minded and loving and accepting of all people, and we are trying to raise our kids that way.

Recently my kids have been coming home talking about Alex.  Alex is in the 4th grade and was born male

I'm avoiding the usage of pronouns, accepting people, and the very last thing I would ever want to do is hurt someone by saying the wrong thing.

My kids think Alex is weird.  They haven't used that word, I don't even understand.

My husband and I have talked to the kids about Alex on a couple different occasions.  When the kids first stated talking about Alex

So, so we just told them that they need to be accepting of Alex, and that they should never pick on Alex, or treat Alex badly, or differently from any of the other kids at school.  And also that if their friends talk baldy about Alex, or treat Alex differently, they need to tell their friends that that's not ok.  

They're pretty mature for their age, I would really appreciate it.

After struggling for so long, and I got a referral to a psychiatrist for an assessment. (just to point out, my GP has been incredibly helpful and sensitive)

At this point, I've decided to talk to them again and here are the main outlines of their thoughts:

* They think that my GP is a pedophile who was ""planting"" these thoughts in my head because he is sexually attracted to me.
* Gender dysphoria doesn't exist. Apparently I'm just confused. According to them
* Also
* They've also said that ""Even if gender dysphoria is real
* I might also have this feeling because I'm ""afraid"" of manhood. (I also have generalised  anxiety disorder and my mum tried to tie it in) I've tried mentioning that the difficulties of manhood are NOTHING compared to the difficulties transgender people face. 
* She also said that because I'm afraid, that will save me from problems of either gender"". 
* I am no longer allowed to take my antidepressant medication because it was prescribed by my GP. 

I cannot break away from my parents for another few years because I'm dependant on them in every possible way. My only option is to (somehow) explain it to them and make them understand.

I honestly don't know what is going to happen next and I'm scared.

While people have told me it isn't a big deal, woman, or possibly another trans person, I feel like I will not be able to fully satisfy their needs. I do not doubt in a short term experience with someone, I can fulfill their needs (and I feel like I have in the past) but a long term relationship, I “know” that they will always wish that I had the correct organs. 

I do feel though, it is not something that you can do spontaneously. It also requires a lot of prep work and not everyone wants to go back there (which I haven't met yet, but I'm sure they are out there). Lastly, being “forced” to anal does not make me feel any more of a woman. 

At times, you can't fuck them like you would a woman, but you can still fuck their ass, is that ok with you?” and they begrudgingly agree. With such feelings, I feel like sex with me is just the other person taking pity on me, “poor thing, I'll do this just so they feel a bit better” which only makes it worse

Aside from that, etc. What kind of clothes should I bring? Are pads necessary, if so what type? Any shows I should pirate and bring along?

  I thought I would just put up a little bit of my story

  I came out to everyone August of last year. My wife did flip out a bit, during that winter hurricane during last October. It sucked, but it was safe and non-judgmental. 

  I had some friends take their time, and am enjoying the heck out of it. 

  I work as a welder and fabricator, and are very kind. I have found in the blue collar world that if you let someone do their own thing, they will let you do your own. 

  Family didn't give me any strife at all! everyone came around right quick

  I came up with a strategy early on that paid off big time, that I was a girl. Even to friend that I have had for over a decade. And after that I did not correct a single person. They used the wrong name, or pronoun, I let it slide. But more and more people just started doing what I desired, and the mass has influenced the stubborn. I highly recommend this as patience is the hardest aspect of transitioning, and the more you can find the easier it gets. 

  Good luck girls and boys, but we are all here for each other. ",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,

""You were raised as a male

All of that came after. 

I just started crying and to him this meant that I ""can't control my emotions"" and that lead to the ""you cry too much"".

She kept telling me that she can't get over it because she's losing her son. That I'm killing ""him"" and that I'll be another person. And that this is all her fault

She told me that there was no way I was trans since I had told her that I had felt this way from my earliest memories. Which had to be a lie because if I had really felt this way she would've picked up on it for sure.

And then the biggest load of BS - That I would've gone about this way earlier and way different if I was really trans. Which really hit me as ironic since avoiding this kind of situation was exactly why I was so scared to come out earlier in the first place.

So I met my friend online about three years ago. To sum it up, we're in love for the foreseeable future, and we're completely comfortable with talking about anything. Our relationship is a very positive thing in my life. I'm a female, by the way. Not sure what my sexual preference is, I think I'm leaning towards bisexual or pansexual, but primarily straight... I don't know. I'm still internally debating this because I'm young, but anyway.

About two weeks ago he asked me if I had ever wondered if I was meant to be another gender. I said not really. He then confessed that all his life, he'd wish it would happen every day. He's been depressed about it before, but he's told me he's been emotionally fine recently. He feels like his male genitalia don't belong on him. He's sort of overweight, so he's unhappy with his body on multiple levels. He feels like he should've been born a girl. He made it clear to me that he's not interested in men. Of course I love him very much, and this news didn't change how I felt about him... I honestly should've been able to tell sooner. He's pretty sensitive, he relates to me very well, and he hasn't shown much stereotypically ""male"" behavior. I feel like him questioning his gender explains a lot of that. 

But I've also been very anxious about this whole thing. Mainly because this, but no compliments or nice things I say about him could ever make him love himself. He's got low self-esteem, and he *sees no problem with it at all.* I told him that I'd like to be with someone who has confidence. Someone I can have a family with (he's told me he hates the idea of having kids. Now I understand why). He told me that sometimes he wishes he could have surgery to become a woman, but he knows it's ""not a possibility,"" so he's just going to live with not being entirely happy with himself. That just... seems wrong to me.

It seems to me that his situation (and I've talked with him about this theory, but I've settled with just living with it. Sometimes I want plastic surgery, but I know that it could easily go wrong and cause me to hate my nose even more, and on top of that it's very costly. So I'll continue to live with the face I have. 

I've been worried sick about him since he's ""come out"" and he's basically been telling me ""chill out, and that's good enough."" I just want him to live a happy and confident life. I'd suggest therapy, counseling, something, but he'll just tell me he doesn't need it. I feel like he always has these unhealthy mindsets, but he rationalizes them to the point that I doubt if it's right to tell him to correct them, hah...

So, and by Thursday, I was feeling pretty confident and I was on omegle, and the person I was talking with inspired me to tell someone. So I told my only friend that I have at my school (and fellow redditor) that I was trans and unsurprisingly, she was totally cool with it. In fact, after I told her, she was still waiting for the thing I wanted to tell her

Then, which was alternately depressing and inspiring, and met a bunch of other trans people, but since I'm terribly awkward and asocial in ""mingling"" situations, I left shortly after the ceremony concluded. To reward myself for that, I went and bought some shoes and the cashier called me ma'am, which was pretty great.

So, and if so, how did that make you feel? I think it's one of the reasons that I like the meme/circle jerk ""so brave"" as much as I do, because while it's well intentioned, I think it comes out different than the speaker expects it to. 

I've had this happen a couple of times with different feeling on it. Most of the time it's silent amusement, but I know exactly who I am). With these people, I am silently tempted to inform them about employment discrimination/limited medical access/constant I.D. problems/ the whole shebang so I can part ways sipping my beer and having them stand there shell-shocked from the mind fuck.

Sometimes it's like ""wow

More often than not though, because I realize the statement is supposed to be well intentioned and I try to keep a positive, level head about things, but i can't help but feel that I wouldn't need to be so ""brave"" if other people didn't make me have to be. I realize what they WANT to say is ""you seem like a very strong person to know yourself so well and to say fuck it to social norms if favor of your own independence"" but what is ACTUALLY implied is ""Good luck to you buddy, you're going to need it"".

So how about it folks

It was a long tough row to hoe, and have had other procedures as well.  As much as I hate to admit it, I look pretty good.  I'm not willing to believe that I pass 100% but I look good, and no one, but no one gives me a hard time or a second glance when I'm out alone.

But she keeps misgendering me, ""excuse me, are you talking to me"" she'll correct it.  But the pronouns are out of fucking control, it's like a constant stream of male pronouns.  She just doesn't stop.  The excuse is too predictable ""I'm too old to change.  I've knew you forever as male"", but even during the process of me correcting her, she is still continuing to refer to me as male.  It's truly like some kind of habitual mental blockage.  Yesterday she did it in discussions with a waiter and a hostess, as well as my friends over the course of a dinner out.  It just never ends.  I finally blew up at her, and I had to listen again to how hard it was for her

After that was over i felt that old familiar desire to eat an entire bottle of pills, ready for this...""I'm afraid to refer to you as female in the presence of other people because I'm worried that people will ridicule you and I'd hate to see that happen"".    WHAT?????  I'm dressed as a woman, look like a women, act like a woman, walk like a woman, talk like a women, and she thinks that referring to me as male is LESS embarrassing.  And they tell me I'm crazy!! 

I really don't know what to do.  My relationship with my mother means everything to me.  But I'm really scared that it's reaching a point where i can never be around her again.  She has so little time left, and has told me many times that I'm her best friend. 

Are there people who simply can't, I'm losing the alies I have because they think I'm being impatient and disruptive, and think I should just get over it.  After all, I'm on hormones, and living my life as a woman, so why should I let a little thing like this drive me to anxiety since she's just doing it because she's old.  People act like I'm picking on her.

Today my fiance, she'll take over 2 hours meticulously doing her legs. 

I've joked before, but as I said, she attacked me emotional and threatened to put me out on the street, so perhaps she's repressing all that.. anyway.

She accepted my shaving challenge and today the real 'me', but it was such an amazing emotional experience.

With each stroke of my razor, it was like she was getting to peek out of the prison she's always been trapped in.

As I finished I stretched my legs, I beat my fiance at shaving her legs, but at that point I didn't care of course and she could care less, but what really mattered was I got to see the legs I'm supposed to have, for just a little bit.

I was quiet the rest of the day, hugging my legs to my chest as I felt my tears trickle down my currently bare legs.. it felt refreshing. But soon the hair will start to grow again and then it'll all be gone, part of me almost wishes I hadn't, because now I know even more that I'm in the wrong body.

I ended up on Susan's spending a lot of time idling in IRC. I got a car, obtained a drivers license, all in that order. It was scary as hell and far far outside my personal comfort zone, but I was motivated and determined to change my life for the better.

Then I took what felt like a leap of faith and found my therapist on Twitter. I got lucky

She's really kind. She's made it clear she's only along for the ride and not here to steer me to where she feels I should be going. I lay out a transition schedule myself. I tell her that first session that I want to start with hormones and transition into fulltime as puberty progresses. She called up an endocrinologist with a warning: the clinic is usually booked months in advanced.

I'm sorry to be so graphic. When I started to write this post, it feels really good to actually say this. After the fact, I told my room mates about what happened (they were both out of town that weekend) but I didn't want to bother them with the actual specifics.

I was really lost after the incident. Didn't sleep more than a couple hours a night, I found myself thinking that this is what happens to people who try to tinker with their gender. Afterwards, I basically decided to go back to being a plain old straight cis male.

I've been going through this alone for the most part. And honestly, and I've even gone out in femme, but I feel like I'm at a standstill now. I need help but don't really know where to get it.

I feel like a surivors support group could be tremendously useful but I can't find any gender-neutral ones. I would like to go to a women's one but that's hardly a possibility. Given that I still present as male, I wouldn't be able to describe what happened without revealing what parts I have. And even though I AM a woman, I'd still feel like I was invading a safespace. It's really frustrating because on one hand, I want to be mad at the cis-women for misgendering me, but on the other hand, I completely understand why they wouldn't feel safe with me there.

The alternative is a male survivors group, men sounds absolutely terrifying.

Realistically, so that limits my options to pretty much only the therapists that the government would pay for, and I really don't expect them to have therapists who are used to dealing with both sexual assault and trans issues, and I'm really afraid that whoever treats me is going to just make matters worse.

I was finally able to ask her why she would tell people something so personal to others, until she started crying about the whole thing.  She told me that her son was pretty much dead to her, and she didn't know who was sitting in front of her.  That she had been a prayer request because of the bad news. And to top it off, she wanted to be dead before I started the whole thing and wished I had waited for her to die before hand.  Also she thought she was a bad mother because she didn't see it from an early child hood.

Well I talked to her about it, and she promised that it was just a feeling, and that she would never act on it. (I know she wouldn't we've talked about suicide in passing many of times, in a you know its not the answer way).  I told her that she was a perfect mother, if she wasn't I wouldn't have been comfortable telling her in the first place.  I also told her it was a bit selfish for putting her self on a prayer request.  Over all the whole conversation was worse than coming out to her.  She still thinks I need to know every detail about her (genitals and cycle) before I can start any part of the process.  But the most important thing is, she said that she would get over it all over time and that she loved and supported me no matter what.

He kept referring back to breast-lopping and telling me I'm dealing with my problems like only a woman could, ""by trying to cut them off."" *Men* don't do that, though he didn't explain how men deal with their problems. I guess that men take baby steps, like dress in tomboy chic and get roguish haircuts.

1319131339.0,liwam,Consultation with Toby Meltzer for metoidioplasty/scrotoplasty - a report,catamorphism,31,3,40,"Since I don't see a lot of guys talking about bottom surgery here

I really liked Meltzer; he didn't seem to have the usual arrogant-doctor attitude. Plus he was wearing a pink shirt under his suit

I liked that he didn't start by launching into a standard spiel about the surgery, and just asked what questions I had. I started by asking him about keloids or hypertrophic scars, since I have a tendency to form those. He said that he'd never seen those happen as a result of genital surgery, and for some reason, that area of the body just doesn't tend to form hypertrophic scars. So that was reassuring.

I explained the setup I wanted (simple meta with scrotoplasty and implants, and he said that while he thought it worked slightly better to do the UL and meta at the same time (fewer complications), he had also had good results doing it later. So that was good too. He said he only does UL with a complete v-ectomy (something I more or less knew already but I wanted to confirm) because if he didn't do the v-ectomy, the vaginal opening would be left very narrow and ""wouldn't be too useful to anyone"". That was a bit disappointing to me, but I wasn't planning on getting UL now anyway...

He said that almost everything could be done as one surgery (the meta itself, I had the option of staying one night in the hospital, or going to a hotel if I had somebody with me, but it sounded a bit safer to me to stay in the hospital.

I asked about the urinary issues I've had since starting HRT (basically  like a feeling of having a narrowed urethra and very frequent urination) and whether if I did ever get UL

Finally, post-surgery, especially if I didn't have anyone with me, but that some people had stayed for less time.

I liked that he didn't say anything about my weight (although there is a comment on his web site to the extent that the results are best if you're ""near your ideal weight"" -- well, I was afraid of heavy gatekeeping (from its use of terms like ""RLE"" and such) but he didn't ask me a thing about how long I've been living ""as a man"" or anything of that nature. All he asked was how long I'd been on testosterone, and that of course is relevant to the surgery I want.

Then I showed my two therapists' letters to the surgery scheduler and she said they would call to verify the letters and then I would be able to put down a deposit for a surgery date. She tentatively scheduled a date for me right then (in February). I was afraid the ""verification"" would also be a lengthy process, she said that they had verified the letters and I could go ahead and pay the deposit, so I did. Right now I'm scheduled for February 13. 

I'm thinking of postponing it till the summer, but when I had that I didn't spend the night in the hospital.

Meltzer is the only surgeon I've seen about lower surgery, and I only have so much patience for dealing with fatphobic doctors anyway; and I don't want to see Marci Bowers because I'm not comfortable with seeing anyone who's associated with Anne Lawrence. So it feels slightly nerve-wracking to just go with the first surgeon I saw (after consulting with four different ones for top surgery), but on the other hand I really want to go ahead and do this and I can't see it going wrong easily.

As far as financing, but I do start a job in January, so I'll be able to pay it back. I also won't be insured through that job until April (if ever) and I know the insurance isn't trans-inclusive; I'd like to fight for coverage, but for others' benefit; I think it'll drive me to the brink if I put off my own surgery until my employer starts covering it, since that might never happen.

Disclaimer: I'm MtF

The easiest way to buy is obviously online as long as you have the money and whoever is at the shipping address other than yourself is okay with or doesn't care about what you are doing. My situation is easy, a P.O. Box may be possible, if that's not the case you might be out of luck. Really you may have to stick to in person shopping.

For buying clothes in person things can be VERY awkward, I've even gone shopping with my sister (and our mom's cash). Another thing you can do is **DON'T WORRY** about it. The sales people at any clothing store will be used to people buying clothes for the opposite gender and sex all the time. You do not need to explain yourself, but always be polite if they ask a question. Chances are they only want to make small talk, always be nice to sales people.

Maybe the hardest thing is trying to buy women's underwear. I don't know about the difficulty of men's, what kind of bra? What size? Measure your waist and find the right sizing for you. Now, you might be thinking of going to a place like Victoria's Secret, and I actually advise this. You may be the only *perceived* male in the store, depending on how you present, but chances are you aren't the first nor last.

Plenty of husbands and boyfriends go in to buy wives and girlfriends things. If someone asks you who it is for you can tell them whatever you want. I find the set up to be very relaxed and calm. If you're confused

Right, you basically have waist and height. The biggest trouble may be if you don't fall into a wide enough or tall enough measure. I have a very skinny waist and always struggled to find pants for my school uniform. If you are positive it is worth your money, check online. I've had to order pants from Land's End for school to get the proper length and width.

I've been thinking about just stopping transitioning... I'll stay on HRT, cutting my hair and just letting my facial hair grow back out and go by my ""male"" name again.
I haven't changed my name legally yet

The only reason I haven't already is because I'm living in a homeless shelter for women. I have to stay  or at least appear to be transfemale to stay here.

I don't have any family or friends or anyone I can go live with. I don't have the greatest of education and I have bipolar disorder.

I'm just... so disappointed at the results. I've been on HRT for like 15 months now. nothing has changed except maybe my ass looks more womanly and I have...half A cup boobs...
THATS IT.
I don't have money for facial feminization surgery
And besides I can't stand dating guys and women wont date me

TL:DR I'm alone

Should probably give a bit of information, recently just came out to my mother, in England and have an appointment with my GP on Tuesday.


And now I'll just dump all my questions here? I'm not sure... I've probably done something wrong


Firstly, because they always want to get that sorted first, and to say that I only like guys (I'm pansexual, if that's at all relevant.) until I get an idea of my doctor's personal belief on trans girls who don't *exclusively* like guys, etc, but was hoping for tips that could, possibly, something you might have said to your doctor which they reacted positively to


Next, but different sources state different things, and don't tend to agree with each other. The general consensus was that they don't usually, but sometimes do. Also, what is RLE? Is it just going in public in woman's clothes? (if so, I don't really see how that proves anything :/ )


And lastly, and people there seem to be a lot more accepting, but could just be my imagination. I just wanted to know, like... Should you basically just not get a boyfriend/girlfriend before SRS? Because they would either have no attraction to your genitals for several years, and then would do after the surgery, or vice versa. Also, never really had a relationship, would it just be better to wait until I can ""pass"" as a woman or until the surgery to pursue relationships? Otherwise I may get a different view of relationships than the reality? I don't know. Even *I* can't follow my own train of thought. Sorry. Please excuse nervousness and awkwardness.
Not at all the only questions I have, ask. I've got too many in my head.
Sorry if I've broken some rules or something.

This started out as a reply to a spcific post and got too long. After finding this subreddit I want to respond to everyone and do my best to help! I can't do this however
 
I know it sounds difficult

If you want to be a woman/man; if you feel you are a woman/man; if you feel uncomfortable as a man/woman; if you think transitioning would end this dysphoria; do it. Don't second guess

From what I've read and experienced

(I'm not diagnosing anyone. I am not a doctor. I am simply seeing the exact same feelings expressed in this subreddit I was experiencing in my situation.)

NEVER feel bad for feeling bad. Yes, it's true you there is no reason to feel bad. These are all reasons WHY depression is such a horrible condition. I felt like a complete asshole with no right to live for complaining that I ""felt bad"" when I rightly had no reason to. Depression is debilitating and not something to chastise yourself for. Please try to see that there's no reason for this negativity when trying to overcome depression. It only makes it worse. Listening to [Stephen Fry](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2Ta0yFoNG8) speak about his battles helped me take the first steps to resolving feelings like these.

If you want to transition, I want to try."" Just try that. Try. Don't think about jumping in all at once. That makes the problem that much larger and imposing. The process takes several years to even begin and will last the rest of your life, so don't make the first step larger than it need be.

Second, or have been know to commit suicide. Don't think you need to rely only on yourself. There are people out there who will love you and support you and assist you on your journey. Yes, you risk losing friends who do not understand and are intolerant. However, you will find better ones who are truly close to you, who are truly accepting. I was lucky enough to have nothing but an outpouring of support emotionally and financially from my friends. I am truly blessed in this regard, but that does not mean I wasn't frightened. I didn't know who to turn to at first and did not want to lose the people I was close to. You must try.

Third, I was on my family insurance and this will make the process easier, as most plans will cover counseling and/or medication.

If young, do a quick google search for trans forums asking for Trans friendly psychologists/endocrinologists. They are plentiful and are 1)easier to get letters from, quicker and 2)usually give discounts on their services to trans or provide low income counseling alternatives.

If in university

Now

Seeing a counselor should not take long and they will help you with this process. DO NOT think of this negatively. Many people (I might argue rightly so) think of a counselor as just another hurdle that you need to mount in order to get to your goal of hormones. I had an EXTREMELY NEGATIVE view of counselors before I began this process. Do not think you need to deceive them. Do not think they are there to stop you. They are there to HELP and to assure that you simply have the right mental health, [Kylee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_IN08eHoE0) and [Joules](http://www.youtube.com/user/princessjoules) were great resources starting out.

This all will take some time. During that time you will have the luxury of thinking it through and asking questions and talking to people who love you and want to help. please Please PLEASE seriously think about starting soon with that first step. Please try to realize (and I know this sounds horrible and hard and like I don't understand (and I know that I **don't** understand your situation but am making generalizations and trying to help)) that it's ok to feel bad. I'm not going to say cheer up and don't be sad. That's impossible. Just feel better about feeling bad (if that makes any sense) when you know you have no reason. The future can look bleak and opaque and really

Myself, but accepting that and continue to live my life as a man. The medication helped in two ways. It brought my mood and quality of life in check and that in turn helped my think more clearly and say to myself ""Yes. I am trans. Yes, I want to transition.""

A transman tried to join a woman's only discussion board that I am a part of and was rejected. This board accepts all lesbian/bi women, etc. Some members have called other members transphobic for not allowing this man into the group. They don't want to let queer cismen in

There was a suggestion about having bodily transition points for transmembers. I find that unseemly because it seems to negate and reject the transpeople who can't afford surgeries and hormones. It also seems to send a message to the transwomen by saying that we consider a dude, I've only known like three trans people so what do I know? 

I feel like an idiot because I don't understand but some of the discourse over this issue is rubbing me the wrong way. A lot of problematic language and undertones of this weird misogyny has appeared in the discussions. I'm not the most knowledgeable about gender studies and queer issues so I'm hesitant about asking questions there. There is a vote on whether or not to let transmen in (but not queer cismen) and I don't think that I can vote because I am too ignorant on the subject. I also feel bad because I liked that it was a safe woman's space and that is what attracted me to the group. I'm just a simple country lesbian who's there for the dames and the company. 

I'm probably inadvertently using the wrong language all over this post. I apologize if I am. If this is not the place for the question then I will delete this post. 

Edit: Thank you for all your wonderful and insightful comments! I so appreciate that ya'll took time to let me know your perspectives. You've really given me a lot of food for thought. I feel like I have learned a lot so thank you for that gift. I will respond to you all tomorrow. :D

EDIT2: Its just a generalized queer woman's social club for a specific city where people post stuff about starting book clubs and having potluck dinners. There are other LGBT groups in the city but this is the only queer woman's group. 

EDIT3: I'd like to quote you folks in a post in the discussion because it doesn't seem like many trans voices have been heard in this debate. I feel like this would be more educational and informative than the debate go-round that has been going on. Please let me know if that would be unacceptable. Thank you. 

UPDATE: The vote was really close (four votes) but the conclusion that the group should stay woman identified-only. There are a number of people who are quitting because they see it as a disgusting display of transphobia. Then there are the people who have faded out because they don't like conflict. I get the feeling that the point might be moot in a few months because it seems like too many are jumping ship to keep the group going. After reflecting on what I read here

*[I cited a quote from the mod] at what point Female to Males will be rejected. It is as soon as they believe they are trans? Is it when they start taking Testosterone? Is it when they have some form of surgery? If a really butch female requests to join...are we to ask that they prove there not transgendered*

&gt;I'd like some clarification on this because well

&gt;In any case, then of course, transmen should be included. 

&gt;Transwomen are women and such applicants should be treated accordingly as well regardless of her transition point or fashion choices. Our trans-sisters deserve a safe lady space as much as any other woman. I think having transition points for accepting transgendered members sends the wrong message to potential transwomen wanting to join especially if they do not have the financial means to reach the arbitrary bodily goals. A person's body doesn't necessarily determine their identity and having transition points for membership endorses the notion that it does. 

&gt;I'll be honest

I called the JCPenney salon I've had lots of luck with so far, and ran out to get there in time.

And that, because after she started cutting my hair, she started talking about her ""nephew"", and how ""he"" transitioned, even got the full surgery, and now makes a prettier woman than she did at ""his"" age. When I tried to further say what I wanted for layering, for styling, ""But *this* way is more feminine."" I never said I wanted feminine, as if it was both inevitable and any of her fucking business; and finally I got to listen to the stylist's methods of raising her kids, and ""hassam"" to tease him about his looks.

I didn't even know what to say, psycho-bitch with scissors bouncing around your head. On top of that, she was a bad stylist and just wasn't paying attention to what I was asking.

I’m a cisgender, she’s only recently begun transitioning, and still generally presents as male when we’re in public (unless we’re in a safe space or she’s feeling particularly brave). 

My parents are Catholic, and have made comments about how LGBT persons shouldn’t be afforded equal rights. I originally came out to them as a lesbian when I was very young, and while they weren’t openly hostile about it, I faced a lot of cold detachment, withdrawal of parental affection, etc. In recent years, our relationship has improved substantially, I’m worried that they’ve begun acting this way in response to me beginning to date men – that they think I’m becoming straight? I tried to explain to them that my feelings about women haven’t changed

Anyway, and tell them that my “boyfriend” is really my transgender girlfriend? I love my girlfriend deeply, and I want to be with her for the long haul. Regardless of my parents’ reaction, I’m going to stay with her. But at the same time, I love my family, and I love that we’ve reconnected. I don’t want to have to lose the support of my parents. 

Do you have any advice for how to talk to my parents about my girlfriend transitioning

Before hormones, I was the one who held, who was in control, who was, essentially, the male role.  It didn't bug me until the end of the relationship.   I had ZERO attraction to men.  Emotionally or physically.  

After hormones?  Right now, really bad. ANd guys...?  Well, I still feel no emotional connection to them, yet, but I think I am starting to become physically attracted.  Or maybe I just really like the idea of penetration...  And the most intense change, mentally, has been my moving from the position of a ""switch"" to CLEARLY sub.  Like, haha.  I went from being the one who held to wanting to be held.  To be kissed, I really feel like I *need* these forms of affection from my partner.

1328211260.0,p83br,At a loss over transgendered friend,ihateblueskittles,28,2,27,"Hello, to wear make-up if she so chooses, finally

My question(s) is mainly about depression and emotional volatility in transgendered persons who are taking hormones. I understood that the hormonal treatments are vital and that she can't stop taking them - not now, careens back and forth between near-mania and depression on a regular basis. The slightest things bring her to tears. Or to rage. 

I'm concerned I don't know how to deal with these effects in a way that is of any help. We've been friends forever. I don't feel like I am fullfilling my part of of the relationship if I can't understand what she's going through well enough to provide the kind of support she wants or needs. All I have to compare it to are the few friends I've had who have had children - the hormonal levels toward the end of their pregnancies and their behavior as a result has been similar. But in the case of the prego-friends, just let her talk"" factor. My trans friend doesn't have the luxury of it being temporary. I'm concerned about the depression, to say the least, but the anger is pushing even her new trans acquaintances away. She needs them. They understand EXACTLY what she's going through, and I don't. Who do you talk to when there's no one who can relate willing to listen? You don't. You just feel isolated and get even more depressed. 

She has a very religious family who have disowned her for deciding it was time to openly be the gender she's always been. Many of our acquaintances are either purposely insulting when she's around or just straight up called it quits on the friendship, right? Nobody seems to grasp that she isn't making a choice. Coming out was a decision. Being female gendered never was.

The point I'm trying to illustrate is that I see her becoming very isolated

I have asked her if I can help, spa night, things to take her mind off the struggle and just be herself for awhile), but the answers are very ambiguous. I think she feels more strange around me, having been a long-term friend from before the coming out, than I do around her (which is understandable. Personally, I might feel in her situation like anyone I knew before would never be able to see me as I am now without finding it weird in comparison. I don't find it weird

I'm looking for ideas from people who understand what she is experiencing. 

* Should I encourage therapy? Would that seem like an attack? 

* What can someone do to soothe pain like what she's experiencing in someone they care about when they can't truly relate to it? Any tips on hormonal depression/mood swings? 

* Should I just leave her alone? Every feeling revolts against that, I will give her her space. Maybe she wants to cut the tie with me to make friends she has only known post-coming out, so she doesn't have to have that niggling feeling I'm still thinking of her as the way she used to look. Should I ask? Is that a possibility and she just feels too guilty about it to tell me? She has enough on her plate already. I don't want to be a problem.

Let me begin by saying that I support gay and transgender rights.  I don't quite understand the desire to change your sex, I think it's proof that I do still have some fear of what I don't understand as well as fear of what other people think of me.

Now (finally) for my questions.  I think I understand what it means to be gay.  I am attracted to women, and as a married man I know I'd be pissed and heartbroken if I was told I couldn't marry the person that I love.  However, I don't quite understand what it mean to ""identify as female"" or male for that matter.  I understand the difference between sex and gender, but if gender is a spectrum, then why is changing your physical sex important or attractive to some people?  Why can't you just be a feminine man or a masculine woman?  Dress as the gender you wish to be seen as, change your name to something you feel suits you better, find a relationship in which you can fill the gender role you're most happy with, but to me having surgery to change your sex feels almost like giving in to societal pressure.  Why can't you live your life female in gender but male in sex?  I've heard that the disconnect between gender and sex is very hard on transgendered people, I believe you

I don't mean to offend anyone, I just made this thread to try to understand the motive better.  I probably didn't do a good job of expressing my questions, but feel free to ask for clarifications or to ask questions about me and my background if you think it would help you understand better, or feel free to tell me to fuck off if I'm out of line for asking in the first place.



**tl;dr

I don't understand why transgendered people feel drastic surgery is necessary or why it's a problem to have your gender not match your sex.  It strikes me as a response to societal pressures more than a solution to an internal problem.  Being straight and cisgendered though

The diagnosis is going tortuously slow. I'm meeting up with one of their psychologists on the 9th and after that I'll probably have to wait *months* before I get another appointment. If I'm lucky enough to fit their criteria I may be appointed to an endocrinologist

I'm not even allowed to pay for my own hormones.

The few times I've been outside I've really wanted to go into the clothing stores, but I feel really uncomfortable in going there alone.

Reasons I may be transgender:

-Literally my earliest memory is wearing my sister's clothes and loving it. I have been crossdressing ever since then.

-I started daydreaming about being a girl at age 5. It subsided for a little while, multiple times a day for the past 8 years.

-Without going into details

-female hormones make me feel excited.

-Imagining myself as a woman gives me the greatest pleasure that I've ever experienced in life.

-When I walk by female clothes in stores

-It gets to me not having a female body

-I am engulfed by transgender culture. I subscribe to transgender blogs, I'm member of transgender forums online. I am really fascinated by it.

-My whole sexual orientation seems defined by these crossgender feelings. I can only achieve arousel by imagining myself as the woman in the sexual role


Reasons I may not be transgender:

-I like being the alpha male

-When I talk to other transsexuals

-The things we want in fantasy might not necessarily be what we want in real life.

-Fantasizing about being a girl is more fun than the reality of it

-I could never love another man

-I like the male/female dynamic of a relationship (to be fair

-I can't imagine myself being a lesbian

-My girlfriend made me feel positive about being a guy

-When I was with my girlfriend, I really wish I could be a woman in a lesbian relationship with her""

-I have zero female likes

-I don't know the first thing about being a woman.

-I don't identify with females or have female friends or want any female friends

-All of my role models and heroes are men.

-I am very masculine

-I would not want to alter my voice if I transitioned. My voice is part of my identity.

-I would say that I am attracted to women

- I have a rebound effect - When I'm done fantasizing


Other factors:

-I am romantically, but I don't really get too sexually attracted to them. If I do, it's very weak compared to my crossgender sexual attraction. My so called ""crossgender sexual attraction"" involves me fantasizing about being a woman and sometimes having sex with men (because it makes me feel more like a female).

I started my transition (MtF) about 8 or so years ago.  It was rough.  Family gave me the boot for a while, wanting a better life for myself.  I jumped through all the hoops, got the resources I needed, and I eventually went through everything.  I passed with flying colors, and had my surgery about 4 or 5 years ago.

I was happy.  I was normal.  I was just another girl out in the world.  I was finally just living a normal life.  I went out, did stupid things, dated random guys, worked random jobs, took classes when I could afford it, etc.  And no one knew about my past.  No one.  I was finally just a normal girl.  My life wasn't perfect obviously, but for once I was only struggling with mundane problems; putting myself through school, balancing obligations and social life

And now I'm losing it.  I don't know what's happening

It's been getting worse, and it only lasted a few years.  I seriously don't know how to handle it.  I'm completely falling apart, and honestly contemplating just ending it all.  When I think about it logically, it's all downhill from here.  It's not going to get better.

I'm asking because I find it very interesting how my view on that shift has changed over time.   When I first came out to myself as trans, but also going from a straight guy to a lesbian.   The fear of discrimination because of being trans was bad enough, but the added fear of discrimination because of eventually being gay was the cherry on top which for a while really made me feel like there was no decent solution.

Now, for instance, an article say that a transman was ""born female"" (or vice versa)? If so, what could you use instead for that type of construction? Similarly, since ""male"" and ""female"" can be used for a bit of both, would using a term that refers strictly to the biological sex of the person (if such a one exists in the language in question) in a construction like this be considered offensive?

I'm a trans girl and my boyfriend is a transguy. We've been going out for a while and we've trying to be intimate lately. 

Last night we got into that awkward back and forth where he was all, so that eventually I just turned to him and asked what he was comfortable with and if there was anything that made him dysphoric. Besides saying that he liked being ""on top"" he didn't really go into detail... he was clearly very nervous and worried that I was dysphoric too, so we just kept things slow and limited it to making out/playing with my breasts. 

After that

Ultimately though he said something that worried me, but I don't really know much about sexuality issues with trans guys. My gut instinct is to just wait for him to think things through and just tell him I'll be ready when he is. But if there are any perspectives on this or resources I could look at to learn more, I'd be really grateful.

They recently saw some show on ABC involving trans people. The show strongly portrayed the classic trans narrative - showing signs really young, and did well. The third showed no early signs, and later regretted it.

The lesson the show seemed to portray was

Here's my general timeline:

Pre-Puberty: Not into very masculine or very feminine activities. I can remember certain incidents, and being captivated by it. I remember while joking around with my friends or brothers, sticking balls in my shirt and going, ""hey I got boobs herp!"" 

Middle and High School: didn't date until college. Grew increasingly drawn to trangender/transformation media. If there was a movie, somehow magically or technologically changing into girls, I would find a copy and watch it. My secret guilty pleasure was Ranma 1/2.

In college: periodically questioned by gender, had a few girlfriends, but was never terribly confident about myself. (The only way I could ever get off with a girl was imagining I was her.) My interest in all things TG kept growing stronger, and I explained it away as some fetish or intellectual curiosity. I read all about hormone treatment, SRS, etc, all sorts of stuff. You never knew a cis guy who knew so much about trans stuff.

I even tried dating trans people, I didn't mind. They were nice enough. But I never experienced any kind of unique sexual excitement. It was no different than dating a cisgendered woman, which puts a big hole in the ""fetish"" theory. I was always more interested in post-op than pre-op women, and I never watched trans porn (or much of any porn for that matter.) I've realized I was more attracted to the idea of trans women and trying to live vicariously through someone else.

Finally, supporting myself, and I could actually allow myself to think. I finally came out to myself last February or so, at age 23. Once I stopped repressing my feelings, my dysphoria became incredibly strong. I could barely look in the mirror. I started comparing myself to every woman I met on the street. It was crazy.

I finally sought out a gender therapist

The problem for my parents is they saw none of this. I never tried on my mothers heals. I never came to them when I was five and told them I was a girl. I can remember some stuff from early childhood

So, and how many didn't? Is there any hard data on this? Any references, testimonies, etc I can show my parents to help dispel this idea that everyone knows when they're really young?

In the end

Being trans is kinda cool like that. By meer shear fact that we cannot internalize who we are, think ill of us, etc. We don't need to put up with them being in our lives, because they already have such a strong sense of not liking us that they steer well clear of us; they make themselves out as totally obvious. Other people should only wish they could be so lucky.

That doesn't mean that life is going to be any easier. That doesn't mean that there isn't a certain amount of ""bonus"" one gets for being ""a part of the pack"" (one of us, but how much is that ""bonus"" worth when you are somebody like us and would need to trade in the meer essence of who we are, the ability to be our true selves, etc. for such a thing? For people like us, there is nothing more valuable in our lives than getting to finally be who we truly are; to have the outsides match the insides.

We shouldn't be so superficial that we need to care about what others think of us. If we did, I rather die than sit here worrying about what others think of me.

And to be honest, look at that person have so much courage."" Being yourself is the one thing, especially growing up, that a lot of us were so afraid to do, and, to no real surprise, everybody else was too. Being a part of the pack meant everything: safety, power. And a lot of people eventually matured to understand how petty it all was. How fake it was. How **bullshit** it all was. It got better because we all eventually challenged the lie that everybody should be alike

In the end

I surround myself with accepting people, and not to underestimate the kindness of others. When we learn to accept the world around us, we find how accepting the world can really be.

And that doesn't mean there aren't those out there who will seek demise of others for being different than the pack. That doesn't mean there aren't those out there who will speak, and use your good judgement. It saddens us all to see someone like us get hurt for just being who we are.

There is a long ways to go, the history books will write us as the ones with the courage and bravery that changed the world. The ones who were right and true, not bigoted and fearful. Take solace in this fact, and keep your bravery as strong as possible, educate others as much as you can, and don't let fear rule your life so that the next generation of transfolk can have it just a bit easier than we did.

Some trans people are okay with it, (I am as long as its a close friend saying it, among friends,) but you should always make sure before throwing it around carelessly.
 
""I knew you as a [biological sex/previous name/etc.]
Absolutely not. Don't get me wrong, I don't really agree with you, so instead of trying to accept a different mindset, I'm just going to ignore it."" I can assure you that nowadays you'll get some really weird looks calling someone with boobs a 'he'.  It's very discouraging to be constantly reminded of that old false identity that I'm trying so desperately to escape.
 
""Is/Are your dick/boobs/etc. real?""
I really can't believe how many times I've heard this question,) but the number is astounding. This is sorta the same thing as the genital surgery - unless I'm planning on sleeping with you, (and protip, I'm probably not,) then it doesn't matter. I absolutely hate this question because people don't really seem to think it through - just because I'm trans doesn't mean you have a right to know personal details about me. You wouldn't ask a cisgendered girl if her boobs were implants or not, right? Then don't ask me.
 
""What was your old name before you transitioned?"" or ""What's your real name?""
This is probably the biggest offender on the list, to put it simply. It's telling them, ""Oh, well, this new name isn't really new, what's your real name?"" It's -extremely- disheartening to have someone press this, since it reminds us of something we are trying desperately to divorce ourselves from. Most people find the old names inaccurate, (I know I do
 
Also
DON'T OUT A TRANS PERSON WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT.
I don't like being known as trans. I'd prefer to be known as female, don't introduce us as ""My trans friend"" or things like that unless we bring it up first. Like the name thing, this really strips away a part of our identities, and is very dehumanizing in the sense that it says we're not seen as our true gender, but instead as ""a trans person.""  We'd rather be known as our true gender.

I go to a catholic school in a fairly religious area.  Most people here are religious and go to catholic schools.  My classmates are pretty anti-LGBT.  Once we saw a lesbian wedding on a bus ride, gross, they shouldn't do that with little kids around.' (There were small children attending the wedding.)  I would hate to see what they would say about a trans* person.  I have one friend who is pretty open minded, mostly because she comes from a HUGE family and has transgender cousins she hangs out with.  I know she would stand up for my mom if anybody made fun of her.  They were once browsing Facebook and saw something on somebody's profile that said something like 'the struggles of being a boy in a girl's body' and they said he was 'crazy' and asked 'what does that even mean, if you have a girl's body you are a girl'.  That is the only time trans* issues have even come up.  

On the religion aspect: Since it is a religious school, I'm kind of burnt on religion now.  My mom had so many troubles growing up, believing she had evil thoughts or God would hate her.  My friends all think I am deeply religious (except for the one I mentioned earlier) and would be shocked if I said otherwise.  I am not going to confirm later and that will be an issue too.  I know somebody will bring religion up and say it is against God's law.

I am going to need to talk to them about this.  Has anybody had this experience?  How do you have this conversation?  How do I respond to criticism or rude comments?  I am so nervous,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,,t3_1kdx7i

I'm married, when I feel comfortable and reasonably passable.  In other words...she has been incredibly accepting and open and loving.  And we've talked about exploring it together here and there.

Unfortunately, we agreed that my son doesn't need to know about this, and I didn't want to transition/go full time because I knew it'd mean sacrificing the (now *mostly* healthy) relationships with my family.

My wife was SO unbelievably accepting about all this...she even helped me pick out a female name and she encouraged me to go ahead and paint my nails and wear them around the house for the day.  I was on cloud nine.  It brought about a clarity about my body image too...I gained a LOT of weight since moving out on my own

Now why was this stupid?  Because I got so excited that I pushed thing way too fast, skin care, growing my hair out) to make passing easier for the times I wanted to dress.  She said she was fine with me shaving my body, growing my hair long, practicing makeup, etc...

But...she came up to me that evening and said ""I am ok with you being a girl in the bedroom, and I left it at that.  Shortly thereafter, I removed the nail polish.

The biggest issue here is that this whole turn of events seems to have unleashed something in me that I didn't know was there.  I found a genuine desire to explore the possibility of living as a woman, and she said that's fine if I am, and she'd support me, and we could even live in the same house so I could be with my son, but she'd have to divorce me.  

She didn't say it with any hate or judgement

So there was no anger...just sadness.  It really felt a bit like being told by someone you've been pining for that they just have no romantic interest in you...where your heart just *aches*.  I just don't know what to do.  I want to put the genie back in the bottle.  I want to un-ring the bell.  I want this to just be a fetish and an exciting occasional expression of femininity in a world where men aren't allowed to be soft or cry.

I'm just scared this sadness won't go away

I guess I don't have a specific question

**Edit:**  I'm not a guy who walks around depressed much.  I get bummed sometimes, etc...), but I'm not someone who gets really really down.  My wife noticed something was wrong IMMEDIATELY when I came home today.  She asked if I would talked to her about it, and I started to share what I was feeling.  Sometimes she doesn't communicate as clearly as I'd like, and in fact, she's usually the one resistant to in-depth conversation about our feelings.  Well, turns out

As I opened up the issue before her

So yeah...after that clarification, and she's every bit as open and accepting and even enthusiastic about this whole thing.  I don't want to go full time.  I don't even want to do part time as some sort of a test.  If something changes down the road, that's fine, and we'll deal with it then...but for right now, I just need an *outlet* for this side of me.  And she's willing to facilitate that...right down to letting me shave smooth and buying me pretty smelling lotions and body wash.  She has no problem with me de-masculating at bit so I can switch back and forth easier.

The dodgy drug dealer on the corner gets the same pleasantries from me as a sweet old lady doing her shopping does. Anyhoo, just more shouting and swearing. I ended up having to get up and leave, apologizing to everyone as I went. I was left feeling very embarrassed and concerned that I was seen as somehow being discriminatory.

Unfortunately

I'd like to make it clear that I do not believe that most transgender people would act this way nor do I want this to be a platform for judgement on anyone.

I visited an ""informed consent"" clinic and will see the MD for hormone prescriptions on my next appointment in a couple weeks.  My current hypothesis [forgive me this, I am not 100% certain (I realize nobody is).  This is in part because of:

* implicit self-doubt (maybe some remaining internalized trans-phobia
* because I do not utterly and completely *hate* being a man (e.g. not suicidal at the thought of not transitioning)
* fear of the costs, and potentially not passing as well as I'd like (physical features, not to be too vain).  If I could be happy doing part-time crossdressing for the rest of my life, it might be desirable just as a path of least resistance and lowest impact on my life overall.

Of course

So a trial (3-4 months) would help determine some of this (e.g. **love** it or hate it).  And if I do decide to transition

I'm a little afraid of not being ""able to stop"" (people describe euphoria and placebo effects -- the advice I've heard is ""things tend to snowball after starting HRT"")

I'm a software developer, because I came out as trans. I was thinking about moving on when I was ready anyways, but I would've liked to do that when I was ready instead of being forced out. I'm in South Carolina and the company is around 10 people or so, so I don't think there's any legal action I can take.

My boss is giving me another month and a half salary

I would really like to be out as a trans woman on my resume if possible. I'd rather not try to get a job as a man just to lose it when I come out.

I haven't legally changed my name yet

1346183466.0,yz866,Planning on posting this to my FB along with changing name and gender. What do you think?,Jill_s,27,5,19,"I'm going to start this with an apology: This isn't going to be easy to read. It was even harder to write (for various reasons). The idea is to sum up about 25 years of experience into a concise account
 
You may have noticed the subtle (and not-so-subtle) changes I've made to my profile. You may be surprised to notice that I've unchecked the little male checkbox and instead checked the little female checkbox. Knowing me
 
I have never felt completely comfortable in the role of ""male, or to play the role which they've been cast into, to internalize that role and to shut away those characteristics in themselves which might bring that ridicule and violence upon them.
 
This choice is not a hard one to make in Memphis, but in the sense that I was playing the gender role that was expected of me, I was normal.
 
And I was good at that role. I was so good in that role that I was able to completely curb any femininity in myself, the more pervasive they became. I wanted to kill these thoughts, and that desire influenced some of the most dramatic choices I've made in my life, for instance the decision to join the military. Those of you who've known me long enough know how uncharacteristic that was of me. But it's important to note that through all of this, I did not know what it was that was plaguing me. The wall of denial I had built was strong enough to block out any specifics about what caused me so much pain, and just left me with a feeling of malaise at various points in my life.
 
It was this feeling of malaise which prompted me to finally seek some help earlier this year. As I said, as a result, myself. It was months after first seeking counseling that, like a flash, the denial was gone. I walked into an office that day a confused man and walked out an hour later as a VERY confused transgender person. The suddenness with which this awakening had occurred, paired with the enormity of the implications that it entailed plunged me into a very bad place for the course of about a month. I could hardly sleep, I could hardly eat
 
Since then, and have come to not only be ok with, but in a way to embrace the woman I've locked away inside of me for my whole life.
 
So now we get to the meat of this little piece of narcissism I'm writing: As of today, albeit the correct one this time.
 
It's a huge deal for me, scared shitless, and worried. If there is one thing I'm sure of though, it's that I'm going to need the help and support of all my friends. That's where you guys come in. I know you're all awesome, so just keep doing that. It'll be easy.
 
If you have questions about all this sensational news, so don't feel like you can't talk to me about this.
 
Thanks for reading my long diatribe and here's hoping you're just as excited for me as I am.
 
I love you guys. Each and every one of you.

We're not looking to make this character obviously transgender, I know that if the only thing that makes him transgendered is being transgendered, then he'll just be a token character. We're looking for input so we can convey and discuss real social problems surrounding transgender issues without it being the only thing his character is about.

Anyone interested in helping me with this can reply here or you can message me privately. I will keep everything in strict confidence.

And in the interest of full disclosure: the story I'm working on is a fanfiction so it's not the sorta thing that will see mainstream attention but I still take it very seriously.

Thanks in advance to anyone who takes the time to respond. I look forward to hearing from y'all.

**UPDATE**

I'd just like to thank everyone who has responded so far. It's been very encouraging and I'm already starting to learn a few subtle things I was painfully unaware of previously.

Because there has been some requests for more specifics about the character in question

I originally withheld that stuff for two reasons: I didn't want to leave spoilers around on a public forum and I recognize that the setting I'm writing in in very niche so I was concerned that being forward with that might disinterest people from responding. I'll go ahead and be honest now though: the story I'm writing is a recursive fanfic (a fanfic of a fanfic) in a crossover between Fallout and My Little Pony. I'm not even joking

I'm still trying to dance around spoilers here

So this character (let's just call him Kevin) has grown up in a smallish isolated community. Pretty much everyone there knows him and though he's been marginalized in the community

One thing, she doesn't know he's trans and starts coming on to him (rather overtly). Later after he's revealed, she continues to show an interest in him, though she will probably be trying to act a little more modestly about it.

Another aspect we're interested in is conflict with another cis-female character (also a protagonist) who is actually repulsed by him when she finds out. (he has a prejudice against her for other reasons

Something we're not sure if we want to include or not is at some point later on in the story (towards the end of act 2 probably) is having him in a fight with one of the antagonists who is very intent on doing.. er.. some very unspeakable things to him. Kevin will of course be able to fight him off (or at least to a stalemate until someone can help) but I'm worried that a scene like this could be too difficult/controversial to get it right and I worry that it would draw too much focus to that part of his character and make him *about* that. So I'm interested in y'all's opinions on having something like that in the story. (**UPDATE**: the current consensus we've gathered is that we should cut this scene but we're still open to hearing opinions (good or bad) about it or suggestions about what would make a scene like this work.

Moreover I thought in the back of my head ""I *deserve* to feel good about myself. I *deserve* to feel pretty for how long I've suffered and dwelt deep inside a body that betrayed me at puberty."" It was basically fairytail hopes of good things coming to those who wait, of providence throwing me a bone for enduring this all my life. 

The first few months of my transition were filled with a sort of wild happiness and tremendous hope. Even if things weren't coming together in the way that I'd hoped, I'll start feeling better about myself.""

Stronger and less shallow people would swallow the pain, it doesn't matter what the rest of the world thinks. But I can't get past it. I can't get over the unfairness of it. Again, it's childish, but I just can't let it go. 

The hormones have opened up a spectrum (and an instability) of emotions that I didn't think was possible, and it feels wonderful to be with them, to feel accepted and affirmed. They're the nicest sort of people you could hope to fall in with, they tell me how pretty I am and treat me like one of the girls, for all my awkwardness and manishness. I know I should be happy, that I should take *this* as success in my transition that I've been waiting for. But it rings hollow when I realize that on some level, they're humoring me. That they see the same mannish face that greets me in the mirror every morning, all their kindness just breaks my heart.

First off, and I feel that it's been a lousy tenant. Once a month or so it keeps me up at night, leaves the place a mess, and generally makes my life miserable. Not to mention, I've been putting off a maintenance (gyno) visit for far too long, and there's the ever-present threat that it might get sick, and then it might get *me* sick. Plus it's got this friend, who insists that with the two of them around I can totally have sex and babies...unfortunately

So, much less something as major and irreversible as a hysterectomy. And while I know that many FtMs have this done, it is always part of a larger transitioning process which is not for me.

I don't identify as male any more than I do female. I don't care how people view or refer to me, it's this subreddit...

If not, but I'd rather avoid it if possible. I would like a total hysterectomy: removal of the uterus, cervix, and as much of the vagina as possible. Ideally, the end result would be something like a nullification, leaving no vaginal opening whatsoever. But really, I'll take whatever I can get. My goals are: no periods, no chance of baby-making (in that order).

As a potential third route, but maybe it would look ""less crazy"" to a doctor than being neutrois.

Finally...I know I will need doctors involved to make this happen, and I do have health insurance (not sure if they'd cover something like this; how do I find out?). Will I need to see a therapist to ""prove"" that I'm sane and serious about it? This is something I've thought about ever since puberty, and seriously considered/researched for a few years now. I understand that it is a major surgery, I know there are risks, I am willing to accept the consequences should I someday change my mind about having kids, etc...

I am a 29 year old guy

Quick back story, but thinking about it more I clearly remember wanting to always wear womens underwear, always wanted to go to sleep in them and wake up in the morning wearing them instead of boxers, but was terrified that my Mum or Dad would pop their head in at night to check on me and see, if the covers had fallen off or something.

I joined the army when I was 19 and didnt really crossdress at all for years, then when I was 26 I left the forces, met my wife and got married, had kids etc, I told my wife all about this, and she encouraged it, still does, not INSPITE of who I am, we go out shopping together for clothes, grown my hair long and started going to work in a ponytail

This is all sounds great, because I just don't feel like a guy, I get jealous of almost every attractive woman I see, its not the normal guy thoughts though, I want to BE them, not be IN them, is the easiest and bluntest (sorry) way I can put it :( I watch my wife getting dressed and I'm jealous of her curves and breasts and long thick hair that always looks good, because its true

Not related to my gender confusedness, talking to them on good ol' AOL chat when I was younger and arranging to meet up but then bottling it, I joined the army when I was 19 and spent much of my early 20's in the following cycle on nights out every weekend, go out with friends and get drunk, slink off to a nearby gay bar and hang around outside scared to go in in-case I knew anyone in there, go back home and immediately get on webcams for guys, arrange to meet up, rinse and repeat.

I've always been painfully shy, with a lot of help from my wife, I recently went for a day out to a farm with my little girl, wearing some skinny jeans, a long, blatantly womens, cardigan and my hair tied back and put in some plaits, i really feel like I'm finding myself

In a perfect world I'd have a smooth stubble free face, and for a while I thought I was (going on depression meds after imagining killing myself on the commute most mornings, and getting lost staring into a mirror thinking about stabbing my adams apple with some tweezers!), but I don't think I feel like a woman! :( and transition is also something I don't know if I could ever go through with, unless I was holding a gun to my head every night, but that won't happen as I am not desperately unhappy as a guy, and I get butterflies in my stomach just thinking about coming out into the open with all that and being out there for friends and family to disown and the world to laugh and stare at as I pass in the street.

I kinda wish there was a button that I could press where I wake up as a woman tomorrow

I don't need to transition. I'm okay being a guy; being female just seems vastly preferable to me. Maybe that will change in the future and I'll absolutely need to transition, and I still want to do it.

Does that make me less trans? Many people on this sub give me the feeling that, so often I hear people shout ""no one WANTS to be trans. We don't CHOOSE this, it's a medical necessity for us to transition.""

They are Mormon. They were extremely abusive when it was convenient for them

I'd been battling depression, and persistent suicidal thoughts. I started taking St. John's Wort for the depression, and it helped some but it also caused me to gain like 4 kg because it messed up my ability to feel satiety signals.

I've presented as female in public all of twice this whole year. Of those times, though, so I can't recreate that situation.

The only way I've survived this year is because of the emotional support of my live-in significant other, he lives a very long way away.

I've never lived anyplace more than six years. I've lived here about a year and a half now. I have no close friends anywhere near me in person. None of the passing acquaintances I've made here really know how to relate to a depressed, because they think I'm their evil boyfriend who is turning them against their family (I actually helped save them from what was an abusive situation, and may have made my feelings on this matter known).

I look in the doors at other people's homes and see trees and lights and the uncluttered floor of a nondisabled family that has the ""spoons"" to keep up with things. I remember watching the tree with the lights turned out, and jam, and lip balm and hand lotion. I remember watching my brothers try out their new video games. I remember helping make Christmas dinner. I remember reading aloud the Nativity verses. Everything around me reminds me of a million things I'll never have again, that I miss so bad even though my gene donors think I ""can't remember the good times"" just because I asked why they beat me and threw me out and scared me to death of my body.

I'm scared that I won't survive Christmas.

The local LGBT centre is doing something for Christmas, but she doesn't know me that well or even that I'm trans. I have at least one gift to open, that my ""adopted"" sister online sent to me. I don't know what else to do.

I am not entirely sure how to start this.  I've been turned down in the past


My last serious relationship ended a little over a year ago.  I took some time to just work on me, got a new job, etc.  However in the last several months I've found myself getting lonely, craving intimacy, (and sex) and generally really wanting a relationship again.  So over the summer I've started actively dating again, trying to meet people, etc.

And ugh

1. Meet guy
2. Go on date. It goes wonderfully!
3. Perhaps another date
4. Before anything serious happens physically, ""Hey, I used to be a boy, are you OK with that?""
5. Bam

I've gone out with four men since the start of the summer

It's really hard to believe that.  It's really hard to see myself as anything other than flawed or broken or whatever.  I *do* still have inferiority issues surrounding my body.  Stuff like this just kills me.  It feels like no matter what I do or how well we get along

I don't know what to do about it.  This obviously isn't the first time it's happened, it's completely destroying my self confidence.  I don't know how to approach it and it makes me anxious as hell.  If I tell a guy too soon, he'll never bother to get to know me and will write me off immediately.  If i wait too long, they get mad and feel deceived, (and I've been physically hurt once because of that).  It just feels like I'm walking on eggshells, and that I'll never find someone because of something I have no control over.  I hate it.  It's making me hate *me* as a result.  I thought I left all this behind years ago.

Last week I had the most wonderful 2nd date with a guy.  There was physical chemistry, conversation flowed well, etc.  We went out for a lovely evening and ended up talking for literally hours until midnight on a bench by a lake.  It was wonderful.  He started getting frisky and I kept putting it on hold and saying we needed to chat first even though I was getting crazy horny myself.  I told him the next day, (I learned from my mistake and never tell them in person and alone), and poof, never wants to see me again.  Says he ""had a great time and a lovely evening,"" but that he could ""never be in a relationship with someone like you.""

Fuck.  Me.  

How do others deal with this stuff?  When do you bring up your past with a guy?  Again it feels like too soon and they'll never even bother to get to know me.  Too late and you ""mislead"" them or something.  Uggghhh.  It's just horridly demoralizing.  Call me dramatic but I start to worry that I'll never find someone

It appalls me that my sister has decided to target this girl.  It is not the first time my sister has tormented girls at her school; two girls have changed schools and three others have taken out ""no contact orders"" against my sister, because of her bullying.  I am only present at my sister's school a portion of the day, and not every day of the school week.  What can I do to improve the situation?  I know how vulnerable adolescent girls are, and a complication like coming out as trans just adds to the difficulty, especially in middle school where girls are the cruelest.  I have no experience with transgendered individuals, and have only in the last two years educated myself about gender and sex and the difference between the two.

I fairly recently came to accept the fact that, attracted to women still. I guess that makes me some sort of male lesbian? Whatever. I’ve never been overly feminine, but that part hasn’t concerned me – then again I’ve also never been particularly masculine. In lurking this and the other related subreddits, I’ve found myself resonating with the questions people pose to those questioning their status:

* If you could change genders tomorrow
* If you were alone on a desert island

…and other things of that nature. In addition, in fact, obsessively dream about being the opposite sex; I do secretly use every wish, be it on an eyelash or a first star or a birthday cake, wishing to wake up the next morning magically transformed. Next step should be talking to a therapist or something, making the transition, right?

But I really don’t think I am going to do that. Maybe it’s cowardice, in voice or in plain physical appearance, and in either case I feel like it wouldn’t help what I feel inside of myself. Maybe it’s petty, but when I see people who have made the transition, it fills me with fear about taking that step for myself, fear of ending up some sort of Rocky Horror reject if I tried to.

I’ve always been socially anxious, I suppose. It might not work out that way, but whenever I needed to do something, doing it in *my* girl body would be what I fixated on as I imagined how to do it, and that would typically get me through. Maybe I am full of high standards or something, but the way I worry I would end up looking, I don’t think it would give me any confidence; if anything

So at least I have the Internet, who responded to me insisting I was male with “Bullshit,” if I am not mistaken. But that, my Internet friends who all accept me as female, is where I spend pretty much all of my time, in a safe environment full of confidants. I certainly don’t have a problem with it, but sometimes I think I’d like to meet some of them

I don’t even know if I have a question, hating myself, denying myself basic things as a sort of penance for whatever I did to end up this way. But then again, I’d really rather not draw the ire of the rest of the world for something that might not even make me feel any better. 

Really sorry if what I said was offensive to anyone. I don’t mean to say that trans people are hideous or anything, that when I see pictures of people into their transition, that is never what I *thought of myself* as, and that’s a scary thought.

I came to school

I admit I'm prone to emotional episodes, and try to instead reason with the person who made me mad in the first place. I much prefer peace over anger.

If I even HAD an emotional outburst, and frankly should not even matter in a hair salon. They say they've been very patient with me, and they have, but I'm being kicked out ""for the safety and well being of the students and staff"".

I don't think I look dangerous. When I get angry, there is NO WAY POSSIBLE that I am a threat to anyone.

I don't believe for a single second that this is the real reason. I think I'm being discriminated against for what I am. I think she just wants me gone

The thing is about all of this.. things were perfect. She was supportive and a great teacher.. It's like she all of a sudden flipped on me after I confronted her about outing me. Red goddamn flags all over the place. I know I may get frustrated and I may get emotional

And it's not just me she has a problem with, bigoted, opinionated things. 

There are two gay girls who work with us, and whenever we mention her she kinda scoffs and doesn't want to talk about her. The other girl she's had a wonderful relationship with until she found out she had a girlfriend. She kind of didn't talk to her or even look at her after that.

She said all single/teen moms are sluts and don't deserve ANY help from the government. There were two girls there, and my teacher said to their face that they were sluts.

She acts really weirded out and distances herself from the little person that works with us. She told me she wears it on her sleeve and shouldn't. I think that disgusts me more

That's not to say of all the times she's intentionally ruined something I was doing. A client wanted a blowdry

She's cut random bits into my haircut and tried to explain she was ""notching"". You're not supposed to take GIGANTIC SLICES out when you do that. 

I had a little girl as a client and she yanked the hose away from me as I was washing her hair to show me how to do it properly

I was done what I was doing in every one of those examples, and when I tried to do it as well, she just would not let me try.

I just thought I'd share something I remember as a kid I thought was funny. 

Maybe some of you have had similar experiences. When I was a kid I always had a fascination with any program about transgenderism that might come on the tv. I've seen a fair bit over the years. You know the Discovery channel or Discovery Health documentary type programs about the subject. One night when I was probably about 9 years old I remember watching one of the late night news programs probably 60 Minutes or Dateline. 
I can't remember many specifics of the program just alot of stock footage of doctors in lab coats holding up x-rays and people riding bikes.

Now
One was about health benefits of biking or malfunction bikes

I'm not actually sure what it was I saw, ridiculous now. But in my little 9-year-old mind I construed the program that night to be just one big long story on how riding bikes could make you change sex sometimes.

I'm 22 years old right now. I work from home

I have also been feeling this whole transgender issue since about 15/16(i'm MtF) which is fairly normal (for transgendered people) the problems I've had is the same ones most people had

&gt;1. I don't hate my body, maybe the hair, ew.) 

&gt;2. Am I really transgender? 

and finally the big one i've been struggling with recently

&gt;3. I don't feel completely like a woman 100% of the time

I'm going to give you my answers to these in order

&gt;1. You don't have to be self hating to be trans. If you feel like your inside doesn't match your outside and &gt;you have the will to change it

Some people think of their body as a something not to be damaged

I however believe that your body is just a work of art. It is your home, wigs depending on the day, and for some people it could mean SRS. Bottom line and golden rule I stick by: If it makes you happy, and causes no undue harm to you or the people you care about, then go for it. 

Obviously some of this can be a serious decision but at the end of the day, your happiness should come above, but not at the expense, of others.

&gt;2. I've been reading r/asktransgender for awhile now, you probably are, no one can tell you, they can just share their experience and you can sit on here for years waiting for someones story that is just like yours in order to validate yourself. But why? you only have one life to live, so get to it. No time to waste.

I will tell my story briefly, regression, thoughts about transition, rinse and repeat until 22 where I've started transition, which brings me to my 3rd point.

&gt;3. I don't feel 100% female all the time, because I don't like the results people are gettings and its expensive and time consuming.

If I had to put a number on it, that doesn't make me not trans. it makes me who I am.

And this is what i'm doing about it: I'm starting transition

For some people this would mean SRS, for me it doesn't, and i've started questioning the whole gender binary thing in a serious way.

I'm going to be both

What I want to do is get most body hair removed, and start hormones. I'm not going to stick to a gender binary, I'm going to be in-between where I feel myself. 

I'm going to have tits, some days on the male side. I realize this is difficult and I may not reach this goal, but its who I am, and I'm fighting for it.

If you've gotten this far in my post my words of advice to are this:

Be who you want to be, be honest with yourself, and just go for it. No one is holding you back except for yourself.

    Fought with my identity since ~9 years old. yadda yadda
    Confusion/Self-Loathing reached critical levels last year.
    Finally worked up the courage to tell my parents and enter counseling.
    Came to terms with myself. Decided to take action.
    Started HRT a little over a month ago. Laser is next. (Still deciding on where to go.)
    I still haven't decided on the best approach to outing myself to the rest of the world
        but that day is rapidly approaching. I have a very heavy and stressful course load
        at the moment
            (This year's Official Xmas Dinner Argument is going to be epic.)
    I've decided to get the heck out of dodge when I graduate in the spring.

Here's the deal. I currently depend on my parents for the roof over my head and the cost of school (-books). My mother wants me to wait on transition until I get out of the house. She frames it in terms of my safety (small town Louisiana), CA, wherever.
  
I really don't know why I'm writing this. I'm already on my way

But I feel more trapped than ever.

I [posted a few weeks ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1j07i5/questioning_mtf_long_brain_dump/) under a throw-away. Thought I might as well make a proper account... Short summary is that I think I'm probably a trans woman

Anyway... I know the answer is going to be ""it's different for everybody""

I'm not sure if I've ever actually felt it, and I think I might kind of be feeling something similar. Maybe?

A few days ago, so I just used socks. Then I put on the same top that, last time I wore it, had me crying in the corner about not having boobs. And I just felt right. It was incredible - I felt like *myself*, I felt calm, comfortable, relaxed, just chilling out, and some paint could make me feel so good.

Ended up going to sleep wearing the stuffed bra, and I kind of felt like I really had breasts - the socks had warmed up, and it kind of just felt like they weren't there at all. All good, until I took the bra off.

I just felt really weird. Wrong

I've made some really dodgy impromptu breast forms out of stuffed pantyhose legs, and even worse after I take them off. They've got a sort of comforting weight to them, if that makes any sense.

But that weird

One other instance - the day after I bought the bra, basically), and my testicles feeling a little bit uncomfortable, it's actually surprisingly comfortable. After a little while, as long as it doesn't move around, I kind of stop feeling my penis at all. It's not numb or anything, it doesn't hurt, but it's like I just can't feel it at all. My brain just seems to completely tune it out. Especially since I shaved everything - I could feel all the hairs rubbing against it before.

And that feels pretty good too. Kind of calming

When I take that off, brushing against things, and it's like all this extra sensory input that just feels awkward and uncomfortable. I definitely *have* felt that before. Pretty much since puberty, on and off, but especially over the past month or so. It's just never felt comfortable to me, but I always assumed that was just because it's an awkward dangly thing that keeps getting in the way.

So... yeah. It kind of feels like I'm only noticing how I've been feeling when I can get it to stop. It felt normal, for just a little while, I couldn't feel it anymore.",,False,,t5_2r4b9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/1kgxam/what_does_dysphoria_feel_like/

I also think I have undiagnosed social anxiety disorder/social phobia

I have a little sister who is 14, generalized anxiety disorder, and I don't even know what else. She is a pretty big mess.. she can't handle responsibilities like a normal 14 year old would be able to, she doesn't even bathe or brush her teeth regularly, and she can't clean up after herself and won't if you ask her or try to force her to through being grounded. My parents usually end up cleaning up after her..

Ever since I came out, because it wasn't until I did that she started saying she feels this way.

She is going to therapy and has talked to her therapist about this

To me, but she is young and I feel like she is simply confusing being tomboyish for being full blown FtM trans.

Now, or that I, too have asperger's (I highly doubt it) and that it somehow caused me to feel this way. My mom insists that because I played by myself with Lego in my room ""for hours on end"" that I must have asperger's like my sister does.. even though I don't have issues with understanding others, I'm just hypersensitive to the social environment so to speak.

I just told my therapist that I've always wanted to be a woman

Here's the thing. He asked whether I wanted to be trans. Of course I don't. I want to be a woman. But I'd just as equally want to be comfortable in my current body, and to measure my testosterone levels ""as soon as they come back up"" ( how long is that with a couple weeks on hormones? ).

So. Is this a thing? Is it possible to have these urges but to redirect them with psychotherapy? I know brains are pretty plastic but as far as I know shaping gender and sexuality through psychotherapy alone is pretty experimental. I've met some people who claim that sexuality can be plastic

But yeah, really don't want to be transgender, but obviously things are getting unstable and I'm having trouble stopping myself from taking hormones. 

More details : 

It's very weird actually. This therapist is non-religious but has radical beliefs on the power of psychotherapy. They do not try to 'convert' all patients, but I'll be lurking here for second opinions so I don't do anything stupid.

We all have our commonalities with our transition

I'll start

I'm a senior in college. I find nothing in my life more stressful than school. I'm taking 18 credits of political science (all of which are 400 level classes). Two weeks into the semester I can already tell how bad its going to be. I've got almost 200 pages of papers to write between all of my classes. I've got 100 court case briefings to complete. And the worst part is that I'm locked into presenting my undergraduate research at a conference in April and I haven't even started writing it yet. I'm suppose to write a strategy memo on how the Democratic Party can increase voter turnout among low income voters. In the meantime I'm working in the government department in my university library 20-30 hours a week and I just stupidly committed myself to working on the campaign staff for a local politician. I'm also studying to take my LSAT next month and my GRE in May. I can't figure out where I should be going to law or graduate school. I'm living on the brink of bankruptcy on a monthly basis. And I have very little time for myself. The only time I get for myself is right now when I'm sacrificing on my sleep.

My girlfriends keep telling me that I'm either insane to be transitioning with what I'm dealing with or I'm just the most mentally strong person they have ever met. I hope its the latter haha.

[According to the wikipedia entry:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias)

&gt;Confirmation bias (also called confirmatory bias or myside bias) is a tendency of people to favor information that confirms their beliefs or hypotheses.[Note 1][1] People display this bias when they gather or remember information selectively, **people usually prefer sources that affirm their existing attitudes.** They also tend to interpret ambiguous evidence as supporting their existing position.

My understanding of confirmation bias

When I first started questioning my gender, because I was terrified at the idea of transition. In order to avoid selection bias, I decided to go to a random psychologist. I did no background check on the person, so I had no clue if they would affirm or deny my gender identity. I was hoping that they would confirm my existing attitude - that I was crazy,  male, and not trans. 

If he had told me that I was just a crazy guy, because he was affirming my existing attitude despite the evidence otherwise. 

When I went to see a gender specialist, but that's where all the evidence was pointing. 

When people come on to this forum questioning their gender, the comments around here usually consist of ""here is my related experience as a confirmed trans person, and here is how I handled a similar situation."" 

Even if responders said something straightforward like

Where is all this confirmation bias that people are so worried about?

I guess this isn't really much of a question, and now, outright denial and cissexism. I've never had a very good relationship with my parents, they've always been overprotective in a very damaging way that has left me socially crippled and forced me to endure years of psychological abuse at the hands of ""experts"" during my ruined childhood. More recently, they convinced me a to see a so called ""trans* expert"" who turned out to be a lier, gatekeeper, and generally shitty human being, this drove me to the brink of suicide (here's a link to my post about this if anyones interested [1](http://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/umtz4/having_a_massive_gatekeeperrelated_clusterfuck/)).

So I started going to an IC clinic instead; I was excited and relieved to finally start hormones. Then I learned on my first visit that my parents had already been in contact with my doctor before I even saw her, they are trying to destroy the most important trans* clinic in town. 

Today, and also considering the fact that he has always been psychologically abusive toward me, has been the main source of most of my troubles; I was completely right. He viciously attacked me for not getting ""the help I need"", claimed that my past shitty endocrinologist and his psychiatrist crony thought I was ""anomalous"", ""mentally unstable"", and also brought up a bullshit past diagnosis of autism I received from a very dubious psychiatrist as a reason that I am just deluding myself into believing I am trans. He then went on to refer to the pride center which I have received so much help from as a ""laughing stock in the gay community"" (he's bi), which is completely ludicrous, I am about to be fired from my job because my dad works there and holds a lot of sway (but I'm quitting tomorrow anyway); to top it all off, all my friends are supportive and using my chosen name and pronouns, I have no job

So here's the situation. I'm in my late 20s, and socially male. I've thought about being a girl since before puberty (probably 7-ish years old when the thought first occurred to me). After hitting puberty, I was only ever aroused by thoughts/fantasies that involved being a girl. But I've also always stuck mostly to being ""manly"", or at least ""mannish"". I stick to exclusively male fashion and mannerisms. I'm too self-conscious to experiment with cross-dressing and the like, even in private for the most part. A few exceptions privately in my teens, and a couple socially-sanctioned cross-dressing events, but for those I was afraid of doing it too well and inadvertently revealing my enjoyment of it. One time I did it quite well with the exception of my raging facial hair (I seriously need to shave 2-3 times a day to avoid stubble)

I'm also exclusively attracted to women. But that thing about being only aroused by fantasies of being female? My father pressured me into sex with prostitutes and it did *nothing* for me, the act of putting my penis in them was ""meh"" at best.

Sounds like I'm obviously trans-something, I was very drunk, but it was very enjoyable - and didn't involve my penis.) I know thinking about it so early would seem to argue against that, but it was after my mother had begun telling me that I was so awful I'd never have a relationship. And the fact that I don't want to be an ""ugly"" woman (which I would be if I went MtF) seems to argue for narcissism.

Besides,"" a lot of those guys say, and it makes me want to either cry or punch them. Same reaction when they leer and ogle. For me, my heart fucking melts. I'm too caught up in ""aww"" and wishing I was one of them to even be aroused (remember the part about only being aroused by fantasies of being a woman).

Since about four days ago, I know for a fact that this isn't what I am on the inside. I can feel it. I have always felt this. It was the teachings of my parents and schoolteachers and the ridicule of my peers which held this piece of me down, just hiding their behind a curtain, sort of waiting for it to go up.

I'm scrambling to find *someone* I can talk to about this. I'm home from work and chain-smoking half bursting into tears and a fit of laughter

I'm scared.

I'm a writer too. I haven't been able to write anything since everything exploded.

If anyone here can say something. Provide a bit of solace for the moment, most likely. I'm just sitting here wondering if the little clues I drop on social networks aren't obvious. Is this something I *want* everybody to know right away?

So Im just rounding out 24 and have always been a pretty straightforward (emphasis on straight) guy.  I've had a crossdressing hobby since I was quite young (which started out with a pretty extreme desire for God to magically make me into a girl) and have in the last 6 months for the first time come to terms with it.  I'm on my own and have my own funding and can actually shop for things and don;t have to hide, and it goes past just dressing it, it comes all the way down to wanting to pass and be seen as a girl.

I've been rationalizing it in my head, he dresses nice, looks sharp, and is generally (form what I hear) a pleasure to be around.  I like women and frankly tend to not understand how they think much at all.

But it's starting to feel like the more I dress up, although it was exciting, it left me with this severe feeling of loneliness.  I was out there but I wasn't real....I was just pretending (and I dont have a girl voice so i didnt want to try going into anywhere or talk to anyone)

Since then

And so I;ve had this itch in my head that is always bolstered by browsing this sub about transitioning.  The whole thing is far too terrifying for me to even consider but (and I know this is probably a terrible reason) my curiosity is driving me mad.  I just keep thinking ""Could I actually do that?  Would it actually make a difference??""

Also some tips on how to make my girlfriend feel better when she sometimes gets down in the dumps about her perceived slow transitional development? I think she is beautiful and wonderful and tell her so sprinkled with home cooked food and flowers and cuddles.

EDIT FOR UPDATE: I tried talking to my mom some more and it was the same ole' same ole'. You guys raised some points that I didn't think of so will file in my brain for the later heart to hearts that will come. She has only known about my girlfriend for a few months so I'm just going to hope that time and talks will help her. 

On a side note

A little background:  I'm in my late 20s now but I've had an interest in crossdressing since I was probably 12.  I used to go through my mom's things and later my sister's things.  At that point, I would crossdress as much as I could with roommates, although sometimes after I would masturbate, I would lose the passion and change back.  Soemtimes, however, I would wear female clothes all night.  

Now that I'm older and living on my own, practical, day to day stuff.)  I'm considering getting a wig and breast inserts to complete my look.  I have the summer off and I'm thinking that I'll try dressing full time but only at home.  

Other things about me:  I am straight.  I don't find myself at all sexually attracted to men.  I do


My main question is: How do I know if I just enjoy crossdressing as a fetish or showing transgender tendencies that might make me more happy as a female?

I am the gay brother--interesting combination, albeit one I am committed to).  In seeing her as my ""brother"" I didn't really connect the dots that she would be attracted to straight guys and not gay guys.  It was embarrassing to say the very least.

Part of my problem is that I don't really understand what it's like.  My sister has never really been very feminine and girly (and yes I know everyone fits into their own box and can't be grouped into either one concrete box or the other) and she never really fit in anywhere.  I know adolescence is a very confusing time for a lot of people--I only found out that I might be gay a little over six months ago, gay or straight, I will always support the rights of every LGBTQ individual and would NEVER EVER do anything to intentionally harm or undermine any individual in any of these groups, but sometimes I just don't know if she's confused--she never really had a strong group of friends and was constantly having trouble being accepted--maybe a girl could find more acceptance, at least in her mind?

I love my sister regardless of sex, and will always want only the best for her.  I have no problem against accepting her as she is but I guess it's sort of a hard thing for me to want my sister, who for a long time has been my ""brother,"" to be a woman since it would mean she would have to go through a harder life.  It doesn't help that so much transphobia is prevalent in our society, even in some of the most liberal towns of the northeast US (which is where we live).

Please help me understand and not hate me for asking these questions:

1. What's your story?  How did you discover who you are and how did you innately know? (Yes I know it's like something you *always* know but when was your moment of self-awareness--at least for me I had that ""holy crap, became ""haha no kidding!"")

2. Did you ever question or resist it yourself?

3. How did your parents (and siblings) take it?  (Our parents are currently also on the fence--I talked with them about it and they expressed the same concerns)

4. What can I do to better improve my sister's life and show my unconditional love?

Over the years I have seen her come out and supported her through her transition but recently I am a little worried about the things she has been posting on facebook.

Anyone who posts a different opinion ie:""Gay marriage is actually a pretty big step for us and a good sign of change"" is personally attacking her and her trans friends and she removes them from her friends list. The differing opinion is not met with ""I understand what you are saying but I disagree with you and here's why""  instead her and her friends post "" DON'T TELL ME HOW TO BE OPPRESSED.""  

She has been deleting cis friends left and right for differing opinions and posts about it every time "" Welp

It really hurts me to hear her rant and post about how all cis people are transphobic assholes and to see her other trans friends post the same. She sounds exactly like the people she is ranting about. A few have tried to call her out on it but that just turned into a huge wasteland of petty insults and anger.

I may be cis but I am a person first and I am her friend. I do not like being generalized like that and I think that is very unfair to speak about so many people who love and support you like that.

I know some of you may be thinking I am over exaggerating but please believe me when I say I am not. 

As a native woman I post about native issues from time to time but that is not the only content I post. I do not rant about how shitty white people are because 90% of my friends are white and I have no anger against them even if they do not understand the issues I am talking about. People will have differing opinions from time to time but I do not think that is a reason to disown them.

Then she tried dating and got rejected time after time, and for over two years she was single.

Obviously this is a throwaway, so please bare with me.


I don't have many places to turn to for advice


A couple months ago my SO of almost seven years came out to me that they are transgender, there wouldn't be an issue. I'd be there to support them no questions asked.


My issue is this: I'm a heterosexual male, not because I'm prejudiced in any way, but because I'm not attracted to male attributes? If that's a PC way to say it.


I was very against it at first, and I'm not sure if that's something that I can handle personally. I'm having a constant internal struggle because I want to support them but I also still want the physical attraction to be there (I know that sounds terribly shallow and selfish but it's the truth).


Another thing that is hard for me, but it quickly started escalating with no consideration to how the actions impacted me. Like cutting all of their hair off, things like that.

Some time in my late high school career, I did all kinds of stereotypical ""boy"" stuff, I was sexually attracted to women, I thought I didn't really hate my penis since I masturbated often... Take all that, and combine it with the miniscule amount of info that I gleaned about transgenderism- its limits, the difficulties of transition, the stigma that society places on people who are different, I even feared my own parents' reactions (super-Catholic) so much that I don't think I ever mentioned my feelings to ANYONE.

I have this memory of lying in my bed one night, and I should be happy and grateful for the gifts that I have, rather than focus on what I have not.  So, yeah, as most of you can guess, that didn't exactly work. All it did was turn me into a soulless prick who did everything he could to separate himself from anything even remotely feminine- I avoided making girl friends, I kept up with my sports, guns, and difficult enough that I had almost zero time to socialize or think about other things like my gender. 

I continued my introverted ways so blindly that I didn't have a core group of friends in college until halfway through my sophomore year. I just played video games, through magical or fictional means). It was the fantasy that I found so thrilling, although I always preferred at least a picture to ""help things along."" Somehow, I justified this as just being a ""kink"" that I had, so no big deal if I never told anyone and continued living as a male.  I developed some bad habits of avoidance and procrastination- putting things out of mind if they seemed too difficult to deal with- which often resulted in obligations and other things creeping up and surprising me at the last minute. I failed a couple classes, but I perservered and still graduated on time. I still consider my B.S. to be one of my biggest accomplishments that I can hang my hat on.

Now, and horribly depressed. I never had any long-term plans after college- career, relationships, all I got in my head was ""get a job, and take it from there.""

At first I thought my depression was due to my inability to land the coveted high-paying engineering position, or because I only date women once every blue moon, or because I wasn't in good physical shape. Yet, I would look at women and feel emotions that I still couldn't rightly identify. Was I just attracted to women, was I attracted to MEN who transformed into women, or did I actually find the thought of MYSELF as a women attractive? I was too afraid to really explore this any deeper than I already had. I had been teased enough as a child for being different... I didn't want to deal with that again as an ADULT.

Within the past few months, and I saw the realities of this particular community. I saw transition timelines, read what HRT can actually do, even for adult males, and I realized that this might just be who I am. It didn't matter that I wasn't interested in men exclusively, or that I didn't dress feminine (although I do have a decent fashion sense for being born male), or that I masturbated and didn't hate my penis with a fiery passion. What mattered was how I want to live my life. 

I knew my current situation was untenable, or even just stopping for long periods of time), since there just wasn't a deep need for it anymore, since it did nothing to relieve the dysphoria that was becoming more and more pronounced the further I began to explore. I started eating healthier and working out- every other day, 20-35 minute run, no upper body training (I never had a desire to have a strong upper body, that much I could admit to myself). 

I also tried a few small steps in the female direction- small enough steps that no one would notice but me. I started using a moisturizer for my skin, and even removed my body hair (Nair was painless- I followed the directions, and when the hair started falling off, I just couldn't stop smiling).

I've had my first appointment with the endo for my blood test

As I reflect on my past and my VERY recent history, but all the same, HOW can I know if what I am thinking is what I honestly, truly feel?

I ask this, the only person that can determine if I am trans* is myself. So, I have to trust myself. I will work at it. It will probably be a slow process, one that requires a lot of patience and a thicker skin than I currently possess (to deal with all the ignorance and fears others will have), but most importantly, I will need to recognize my own limits. It took a long time to overcome some of the bigotry that I acquired early in life- my inner racism and homophobia were eventually eliminated thanks to my interactions with friends, but my inner transphobia is only just starting to be cracked at. This is probably why I fear coming out to my family so much, Roman Catholic

So, I feel like transitioning wouldn't be a chore so much as just making my body fit my mind.

I was never the most masculine boy growing up; in elementary school, but I eventually gave that up and attempted (unsuccessfully) to fit in with the boys to avoid mockery, or just retreated into lots of reading. I read anything I could get my hands on, and though it could just be coincidence, I ended up reading a great deal of books along the lines of ""Girl has to pretend to be a boy because society won't let her X otherwise"" and always really rooted for their protagonists. The characters that I really identified with ended up predominantly consisting of brainy girls struggling to fit in and find their place; Amy from Sailor Moon and Hermione from Harry Potter were two of my role models.

This didn't really change going into middle and high school. For the last few years, once again, for fear of mockery. I started regularly wearing outer clothing like hoodies and winter coats (from October through March), possibly subconsciously to hide myself. Unlike the male stereotype, I was always quite sensitive, and always longed to have close friends I could really connect with on an emotional level. Just over this past year or two (I'm 17 now, in Grade 12) I've started to build those connections I've always wanted, and overwhelmingly the people I've been able to talk to have tended towards female. 

Only quite recently though, did I begin to question who I really am. My online friends, those few I've told of my inner turmoil, have so far been overwhelmingly supportive of me. My offline circumstances (which I'll explain later) preventing me from trying anything visible, I started experimenting with things I could hide. 

The first thing I tried was asking a few of my online friends to start using female pronouns with me, meaning long sleeves and pants, I experimented with shaving all the hair off my legs, arms and armpits, and found myself excited by how soft and smooth my skin felt without it. Conversely, I've let my hair grow out longer than I usually do. I've always kept my face clean shaven (thinking that my facial hair looked quite unpleasant), so no real changes there. My voice is still fairly high

I've been seriously considering the idea that I might really be a girl, she still does have quite a bit of backwards thinking when it comes to LGBT issues. What do I mean? Well... she doesn't believe that bisexuality exists. I've had discussions with her about this, including bringing up scientific studies to show her, and she still insists that it doesn't actually exist. If she won't believe in bisexuality, what chance would I even have...? I also have no chance of really bringing anything physical into the house to experiment with unless I tell her; I don't really have any space to myself since my mom cleans everywhere, which means no female clothes, hair removal products, if or when I feel ready for it

99% of people(myself included) are brought up to fit into societal norms

We are told to be ourselves, and play outside with friends, but wait, that's not what I want to do. Then you go to school and are disciplined for doodling or playing around. They say ""Jonny has ADHD because he won't pay attention during math and is always lost in his own world, he needs meds."" Well Jonny here was developing his imagination, he was creating himself. But, you see, he must follow ""our"" rules. So they dope him up or punish him to make sure he listens to his ""elders"".

Well those ""elders"" are actually 25-45 year old children who have never been able to think for themselves. They are kept in line by their peers

Well the problem here is there is no such thing as normal. The idea of normal is a make believe point on a bell curve where everybody agrees on what is acceptable... Hmmm, friends, communities, cities, states, and nations that have this sense of normality that directs culture and eradicates those things that fall too far from this preconceived notion of normal.

So these new people come into this amazing world full of potential, play with dolls, or play hell play with YOURSELF. I mean come on... You are not allowed to even explore your own body. That is a no no, by the ""normal"" standards. No self gratification for you. So now not only are you taught to be ""yourself"" only if yourself listens to all the rules but you are alienated from your own body. People wonder why all this violence and need for an all powerful government exists. Well there is the beginning of an answer.

Now with both parents working and the lack of a communal upbringing of the youth, nature, the world and the universe works by mainstream(normal) TV and media. Look at the interwebs, a person expresses themselves and you have a million people(seemingly normal) making fun of that person or saying why that person is wrong. That is culture eradicating aspects of people that it doesn't agree with.

So all of these thoughts and feelings you have that were truly yours have been suppressed in you to an almost nonexistent state and you are taught by repetition that you best not question the norms, but you can't put a finger on it because everyone else is appearently ok and happy. Well guess what...They are not ok. They are just playing this awful game of fitting in. Some do it better than others, some completely let go of any hope to be themselves a long time ago. What a great lie!

When I was in my teens and early 20's, co-workers, family members, and strangers, I have come to a conclusion... No one knows what they are doing. They are just playing a game(though they don't know it's a game) and are following everyone else. Many of them think they know the answers, whether it be money, peer acceptance, or whatever else defines ""happiness"".

Of all of the people I have experienced life with only a handful of people have said ""follow yourself

Now society condemns the above

It has taken me my entire adult life(and by no stretch of the imagination am I done, this lie is all we(society at large) know, Humans are much more comfortable in a lie where they they think they know the answers than to live in a world where everyone is responsible for creating themselves. I mean look at all that work that is needed to create myself I will just follow what is laid before me.

I feel you, the woman I always knew I was. There are these layers, similar to an onion, where at the center is my perfect self, that beautiful, happy to be alive woman. And covering that up is all of these learned beliefs, behaviors, even though it never meshed with my true self.

The act and art of creating yourself is a life long journey. You will not wake up one day and have yourself. The mind reverts to those learned behaviors, scary, and often times torturous road. But god damn is it worth it.

Be your own ruler and God.

I am tired of being refused care. I am weary of searching for some scrap of support. I don't have heart enough to follow **yet another** dead end breadcrumb trail of *possible* resources. There is nothing. Even if/when I get out, deformed and other deprecating D words.  

I'm nothing. I'm gone. I'm not going anywhere, but too many of us are just gone.  

This is a useless post. I'm sorry. I don't know what to do anymore. I wish I could just turn this off.   

edit: I apologize. I feel really bad for posting this; it was a mistake. I'll provide some context: I've been seriously considering transition for 10 years, or everything they know is just incorrect. Therapists who can help are nonexistent. The only LGBT support group is very small, and basically a one person borderline out-of-the-home operation. I'm glad it exists, but it's less a strong professional support network and more a group of individuals just doing what they can.  

I've been on DIY hormones for about 6 months at the lowest therapeutic dose, clinic, etc. in the area and been refused care. Sometimes the refusal is polite; sometimes it is not. Just having to initiate the topic and say, ""I am transgender and looking for someone to oversee my hormone therapy blah blah blah"" is intensely difficult for me, and my anxiety gets *worse* every time I have to do that.   

Anyway, but what she's had to do won't work for me. I can't afford to leave the state for basic care. They were able to recommend her local doctor to me, and I made an appointment ASAP. That appointment was yesterday; it was very upsetting and I'm just trying to decompress now. Venting here is part of that, but I think it wasn't really a good idea. I just can't bottle this up this time.  

Just getting there was stressful--it's an hour and a half drive, and seemed to think that I should have SRS before starting hormones. I tried to explain that that is sort of backwards, and offered to share treatment protocols. She was willing to discuss HRT a little, and said she'd do more research and contact me later (more than anyone else has ever done), but she seemed uncomfortable with the idea and I just found the whole thing too upsetting. I just can't deal with this right now.  

So I'm just putting my transition off indefinitely, and I may find a job and be able to leave soon, but I really don't know how long it will take.

What I'm doing now is putting my hand on my chest and my finger on my Adam's Apple so I don't feel chest resonance and my Adam's Apple is high up and you can't see it anymore.

I'm a university student and during my summers I love to travel. This summer I've been traveling through southeast asia, when a woman came out and sat down with me and we struck up conversation. She said that she came here to support her friend, who was in a nearby hospital to have SRS surgery. Knowing how hard transpersons lives can be from things my cousin has told me, I thought that it was really great of this woman to be able to support her friend in such a way. 

Then she started drinking and after a bit she began making really transphobic comments like about ""men getting their penis chopped off"" and such (her words, after she had several drinks (and seemed to be quite drunk to me) she asked me why I was here in Thailand, and if I had the surgery. I told her that I was just here to meet people and see the country, to which she replied ""Yeah right! Show me your penis!"" At this I decided I'd had enough talking with her and left. 

I'm sorry that the above story is so long, but my question really boils down to: was my initial reaction, by feeling offended, a sign of transphobia? I really do try to be a good person, and if my initial reaction was transphobic I don't want to be dishonest with myself and just ignore it, I would rather address those feelings.

About four months ago, but I knew I was miserable and something had to give. I pretty quickly came to the conclusion that I needed to transition medically, but I wasn't in a rush, and I made an appointment to see my general practitioner to basically see what I needed to do to get myself set up. The plan was to have myself settled in a new job before I started hormones, and I was thinking I might start by the end of the summer.

Promptly after I made that appointment

Since then, then a couple more months would be nbd. Things got a lot shittier last week, when I found out that NYS Medicaid is re-structuring the way they pay for mental health treatment, effectively halving the frequency with which I get to see my therapist, who is the only person I feel like I have to talk to about this shit. I've been feeling so miserable and isolated and I hate it.

Today I was walking home from a psych appointment, and they were like, ""Oh, yeah, sure,"" and I was like, ""Well, why didn't I think about this before."" The next available appointment with my GP wasn't until the middle of next month, even though she's not my doctor maybe she can tell me what to do. And then I couldn't stop crying

After like 5 minutes I was able to get out ""I can't be a girl anymore."" And the nurse was like, so that she'd be prepared and I wouldn't have to tell her why I was there and she said it was going to be ok because now I'm starting. She said she doesn't know much about it, but the clinic has lots of trans patients.

* How fast does it grow?

* Does it grow in length and width?

* Can it become overly sensitive? Does it lose any sensitivity?

* Can it get spontaneous erections? Morning erections? Erections when you are turned on?

* Is it situated in the same way as a cis-male penis? Can it be used the same for intercourse?

* What does it look like when ""flaccid""? Does it hide under the labia

* What does it feel like? Can you feel it brushing up against your underwear?

* How does it change masturbation techniques?

* Is there any increase in ejaculate? I am assuming any ejaculate continues to come from the vagina (or is it from the the urethra? I was never really sure on that point)

* Does it take longer

* Do orgasms feel any different?

I have a phone interview coming up with a particular company, I recognize PersonX's name!

I'm mad because, but that was not at all the case.

So if my phone interview goes well and I get a chance to go to this company for another interview, BornAgainGropaga!  I've seen your name on SomeWebsite so many times, and it's a pleasure to finally meet you.  I think it would be great to work together because I know that you are very skilled at what you do.""  And I still could say just that, but...

I want to meet this person and say, BornAgainGropaga!  I'm excited to meet you in person.  I did a Google search for your name, but pretty much all i could find out was how you were a victim of discrimination.  This upset me because nobody should have to go through that, but also because I expected to find information about how good you are at your profession.  I want you to know that I support the rights of transgender people, and if I get this job and I would really look forward to working with someone as skilled as you.""

Would that second approach be ""too much"" for a first time meeting someone?  Alternatively I could do the whole second approach over email

The last option would be to pretend like I don't know PersonX if I can even meet them

Sorry if I've rambled a bit here.  I would really appreciate any advice /r/asktransgender can offer.

**tl;dr**: May meet a transgender person who I know is skilled at what they do, and that I am angry about the fact that they have been discriminated against and that is the only thing that comes up in Google for this person.

**UPDATE**:  Thank you everyone for your responses.  It's only been a few hours since the original post so of course there hasn't been any development in the job hunt or meeting PersonX

I'm not sure that I've ever met a transgender person before here in the midwest, if ever.  If I ever get to know PersonX and they bring it up, we can talk about it then; it is not my place to bring it up.

 I’m a 20 year old cis-male, I remember that I often didn’t get along very well with most of the boys my age, and often sought out the company of girls instead. I always wanted to wear my hair long as a kid, despite my parents’ objections, and clearly remember having a pretty intense, inexplicable distaste for both the sound of my voice and seeing myself in mirrors for as long as I can remember; but I don’t think I ever consciously questioned, or even gave much thought at all to my gender throughout childhood.

 From middle school onward, but I think it just made me act out on my problems in other ways, and it was during this time that I first attempted (and, thankfully, failed miserably at) suicide; I still don’t know exactly what was going thorough my mind when I did this, but I’m fairly certain GD was involved. I tried to reassure myself that any trans feelings I was experiencing were probably just the result of some weird sexual kink, or perhaps just insecurity with my own lack of masculinity; and tried my best to push them out of my mind. The fact that I was now sexually attracted to girls, furthered my feelings of alienation. Later in high school, etc.)

 When I finally found out what transgenderism actually meant (I had previously thought transwomen were basically just gay men who liked to crossdress), let alone family, until I feel completely sure that I am transgendered; I have also have some history of moderately bad OCD (with some hypochodriac tendencies) and can’t help but wonder if this whole thing is just some sort of self-delusion, although it really doesn’t feel that way.

 This is literally the first time I have ever told anyone that I felt this way, whatever. I should also note that I live in a U.S. state (Utah) that is not known for being very friendly toward LGBT types, and am not sure were the best place to go seeking any sort of treatment would be.

Now here's where I might start putting my foot in my mouth. I'm going to use ""s/he"" for the next part, and I apologize if I'm in the wrong. 

So I found someone on OkCupid. S/he is listed as a lesbian, but s/he still choose the 'f' and 'lesbian' labels, rather than 'm' and 'straight,' which is why I'm uncertain about the preferred form of address here. 

Given my own genderqueer-ness, so I think there may be a certain level of transition beyond which my own wiring would no longer be able to pass Go and collect $200.

Now, if things move along with us, that information is going to be very relevant. 

**Actual question:** I've never dated someone transgender before, and, if so, after how long and in what way? Or is that horribly rude? Do I just wait until s/he brings it up? I truly don’t mind waiting; I'm relatively patient, and I think we'll mesh well as friends regardless. But I think s/he deserves to know my potential limits as early as possible, too, you know?

Hello hello~ First of all I gotta say I have no clue how to word this so... yeah.

I'm Michelle, and just trying to move on with my life. I mean I live in a trap house for christs sake.(Its a daily kinda thing, waking up to get some breakfast and walking in on a gang of nigga's cookin crack in your kitchen. Pretty unsettling.) 

Of course We've lived this way our whole lives. My dad used to be around to physically protect us (Dealing with crack heads aint safe) But than he tried to kill my mom and got locked up when I was 6. Having to deal with people getting beaten to near death in your backyard isent great. And worrying about meth heads either ratting your mom out or killing her isent fun either.  Now me? I'm a hard worker, and horribly horribly depressed. The pain I feel... i'm not sure if its because i've never really had a place I felt comfortable sleeping in that I could call home? Or if its because being transgendered is the worst card in life that could ever be dealt, in my opinon.

So I mean I live on a poverty level that sucks pretty bad, being accepted. Most people worry about some boyfriend here, or a car accident there but I work to survive. Speaking of work, I do it, and alot. I have an incredible work ethic and my customer service is exceptional. I know my problems don't stem from me being lazy or anything weak like that. I have an incredibly strong will... but this stuff kinda wears me down over time. Even work, I hafto stand infront of a mirror and pretend like I actually like the man getting ready for work that I see. It honestly kills me when i'm working and someone refers to me as sir, I don't sulk in that pain, I hate it. All the other girls get to wear their hair how they want it and paint their nails and blah blah blah

Now lets not get this wrong, I pretty much just left my house. I was sick of it and couldent go on. I thank my body for having such a strong will to live because for about 3 days I lived on the streets trying to kill myself one way or another. Walking down the street pleading with myself to have enough courage to jump infront of that semi headed this way just so I don't hafto deal with this pain anymore. Something snapped though, I think it was my stomach, and in the end I came home. Came home only to find my mom saying she was sick of my brothers shit (Remember he's physically abusive) and that the only thing holding her back was me and my brother and that she could just go live somewhere super cheap and never hafto worry about anything if it wasent for us. Which she's told us our whole lives. So when I got back from being homeless than I discover she's decided to stop paying rent and is not going to renew the lease and dosn't care where we go. Which is irrelevant because she doesn't pay the bills, my grandma does, she spends all her money on crack and shit. And my grandma said she's done paying so we gettin kicked out unless my mom feels like providing for her children. Also she stoped buying groceries as soon as I got a job. If I don't spend money on food for me and my 1 brother and 1 step brother, than we don't eat. And its not really like I can hold out on them. Being physically controlled by men is disgusting... But I digress.

So I was a no call no show for work for 2 days got a 1 week suspension and I go back tommrow. I'm thinking about just pulling my manager aside and telling him all this because I am DESPERATE. I need help... so bad. I just emotionally don't have the strength to keep on going. All i've known my life was pain and general misery. I naturally think of cops as my enemies because my mom brainwashed me so well.

I'm just.... hopeless at this point. I see no future for myself even though i've tried to carve my own... I just cant do it anymore. Now i'm in an awkward position. Too much of a pussy to off myself and too depressed to succeed in life. I'm so strongly independant and do everything for myself but I seriously need help, acceptance....

Beautiful
By

I look at all the beautiful women around me
While I seethe with jealous rage and envy
It makes me cry that I can’t be like one of you
I just want to be as normal as the sky is blue.
 
Do you believe me when I say I am a woman?
Not a she-man, or a dyke, but an honest girl?
All I ever wanted was to be beautiful
Beautiful.
 
I look at you with your gorgeous curls
Your coach bag
The belt tied around your waist
Your coat accentuating your taste
And I feel cheated
If only I had the strength to give.
 
Do you know how lucky you are?
How beautiful you look from afar?
It’s all a transgirl like me ever wanted
 
To look
To get looks from the guys and comments from the girls
To strut my stuff all around the world.
To wear makeup and jewels
 
I want the privilege you cis-genders have
Taken for granted
I struggle to walk out that door everyday
To face a world that’s chaotic and gray.
 
Did I make the right choice? I believe I did
But affirming my existence to you is like winning a lottery bid
Scary
Would it be better
 
I beg of you to see the women inside of me
Just wanting
I look at you and I see Aphrodite
In each and every women I see.
Why can’t you believe me?
 
I just want a hug,
To feel like a human again
Instead of a freak shunned by nature
Living in-between two genders
A mind-fuck of a bender.
 
I just want to be as beautiful as you are
I just want to love as you can
I just want to affirm my right to exist.
Would you believe me?
Would you accept me?

I've had trouble feeling comfortable with my gender as a male for some time. It took a long time for me to realise it. The discomfort started, yes, but I didn't really develop. I don't know. Maybe it's because I spent so much of my time playing online RPGs and roleplaying... usually exclusively as female characters. I think I'm a pretty good roleplayer. I still RP online a whole bunch. For the past 9 years, I've gotten very talented as sitting myself into this character mindset, and making something realistic and memorable.

Maybe that has something to do with it. So, smart, cute, and totally opposite to me in a lot of ways. We were a great match. Relationship progresses, we get kinky. I've had a lot of kinks, but things delve towards pegging and other such activities. Rather fun. My attention is drawn to pornography and literature attached to these, delving into the domination aspects too. Very sexy. This slowly progresses to transgender pornography too, pretty sexy to me.

My long term relationship fizzled out at some point. Mutual family issues. I loved her. I still love her. Time helps.

I think I became somewhat... fascinated, I think it corresponds more to envy. It was less that I wanted to be with these women... I wanted to *be* these women. It was a strange revelation. Oddly liberating. It came at a time when I was feeling very vulnerable. I had a breakdown of depression around Christmas, and my life started to collapse, held up from failure by my family and friends. My support network was, thankfully, incredible.

So while I was feeling vulnerable and depressed and weak and hopeless

I experimented a little with crossdressing. For a while

And that is kind of where I am now. So I have questions

1. How do I know if I want to transition? Maybe I could phrase it better... How do I know if it's *right* for me to transition? I've always kind of... toed the line between what is expected of me

2. How would I tell friends and family? I have numerous friends who would likely accept me without another thought. And family too. But I have some worries. My father is a pretty gay friendly guy, or apply to be (as I will go into) but even if my father was fine with it, I feel as though he would feel the need to tread on eggshells around me. Following on from that...

3. How would I define my sexual preference? I mean... I lean heavily towards the feminine form. Females, I could throw around all sorts of terms, but things break down as I try and wrap my head around things as I go further. Halp plox?

4. What is involved? I mean

5. I'm worried about passing. I'm pretty slim and neutral, but I feel as though they would be a distinct giveaway. In addition, I don't know if my face would be a good candidate for transition, too. And then there's my voice. While I don't have a particularly deep voice (it can be quiet nasal) I have a kind of range 'gap' in the pitch where I would probably feel a feminine voice should lie.

So, and if you can, I thank you so much in advance! If you can't help, but read the whole thing, thank you for doing so. It means a lot to me. If you didn't read and can't help, but post anyway, I'm not sure why you posted

Everyone else seems to transition and really start to enjoy life and be who they are, no job, nothing.

I hate my body and instead of HRT making me feel more feminine and better about my physical appearance, now it just dries out a lot quicker, I haven’t had any fat redistribution, my body looks just as manly as it did before, everyone talks about their hair on their body thinning and growing more slowly, mine hasn’t changed at all, in fact I can’t shave or wax my legs because my legs end up being covered with ingrown hairs.

I started laser on my legs 2 years ago

I wonder sometimes why my body hates me so much

I am a self-conscious wreck most of the time, I'm embarrassed of the way I look, I just can’t take it anymore.
The only way I can really describe it is that I feel disgusting

The few people who do still chat to me say I deserve some good in my life but it just never happens no matter how hard I try and make it happen all my hopes, so sick of always feeling like this, feeling like I can’t talk to anyone about it because it never changes or gets better and people are just plain sick of hearing my shit.

1373996470.0,1ifd4l,Dysphoria Mostly Gone...,apw01,24,5,11,"So, I love being on HRT! But that isn't why I'm writing this post...

The effects I've gotten from HRT have been subtle and though not hugely physically effective yet, so good in fact that the amount of dysphoria I once experienced about my gender has mostly faded. Despite the fact that I'm not even part-time yet, and still in this (albeit quite andro) boy-mode.

Do I want to stop HRT? No

But I feel kind of anxious about this positive change because I feel like I'm only partially through transition but I've lost a lot of the ambition. I just feel stalled

All this time I've been planning things out - stay on HRT for a year, (halfway to that planned girl-mode switch) it really makes me doubt my transition plans. I've been taking transition at an average if not slow, pace, though I'm happy with this pace. 

Now, or something like that - but part of me almost doesn't want that to be true for me. Though I still have my doubts.

So I guess I'm asking - is this kind of a thing not all that uncommon in some MtF transitions? Or should I take this perhaps as a hint to reconsider my transition plans? Or even identity? When I was younger, moved out, and met other transitioners. Its awful but, this particular circle of transitioners whom I met made me feel less valid as a transwoman because I wasn't near-suicidal with dysphoria, and I didn't feel the need to rush forward with transition as they did, I just wasn't there yet. So as a result of that I started IDing as genderqueer/fluid for awhile. Then I started reading more trans literature and resources and realized that what they had said was wrong and there is in fact ""no one right way to be trans,"" and that other narratives, I started IDing as MtF again and decided to transition. But at this juncture in my transition I'm starting to wonder if perhaps that non-binary kind of ID fit me better. 

Give me that ""desert island scenario, and I don't quite feel as much of that drive anymore, or at least at this point in time. I do still feel a bit of pressure to move forward, but it isn't the same. I feel like if I had to, I wouldn't exactly be miserable where I am right now if I could stay on HRT. I'm just getting really tired of dealing with trans stuff, its been a mental preoccupation for years and I'm almost just sick of dealing with it, sick of it always being on my mind. 

Its a tough place to be, and perhaps for some insight on identity and transition choices. ",,False,,t5_2r4b9,False,,

ive always kept clear from the LGBT stuff.  ive always thought transgender to be a choice and that it only happens to people who give in to their physical and carnal desires.  i always bought in to the bad stigma attached to the label, they don't know God and thats why.  I have a strong faith in God, but have stopped going for the past year or two, due to issues with my church and to my anxiety.

Well, I have started to ask myself if I am trans.  

All of my symptoms and issues that I endured seem like I may in fact be transgendered, if that matters.

I am not really sure what to do right now.  I feel like maybe this is just a phase, and accept that it was what I was born with. My main fear is obviously the world doesn't readily accept trans people, and  I feel many Christians do not as well (specifically my parents).  What should I do now?

I can't do this. What am I thinking? Is this really about gender

My ex-wife knows well of my tendency to flip back and forth along the gender spectrum. Forward is forward until it becomes backward. Then forward again. Like stumbling through a hedge maze in the dead of night. Though at least HRT has provided me with a candle in the darkness.

The golden veil of testosterone has been lifted, looked like a woman. Rather, I look like a male who looks decent ""as"" one. Truly passing will require extensive surgery on my face and body. Not to mention training my voice to sound acceptable. Will I care to keep up with the routine, day after day? I have doubts.

Perhaps the problem is with the table itself.

My life is most rewarding when I am not preoccupied with insecurities and desires. Even matters of gender do not preoccupy my thoughts when I am ""most actualized"". This is what tells me my gender issues are only part of an even larger more complicated reality yet to be revealed. But until I know how to proceed... the flippancy shall continue. 

And so... I choose to pass the lens back to testosterone but will nevertheless continue with electrolysis on my face. A conflict of interest? No. Only another stage until life can accommodate all of me/us. Whatever that will be.
