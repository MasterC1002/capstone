One potential problem with this servery database is serious mistranslation

Here is one example:

From at the official site of the survey documents:
http://www.wvsevsdb.com/wvs/WVSDocumentation.jsp?Idioma=I

Look at the ""WVS - Hong Kong - 2005 (879 Kb)""

First the raw numbers which you used for you world map drawing at page 22 (pdf page#):

http://i.imgur.com/f8Hggjq.jpg

So it looks like 78.1% of people in Hong Kong dislike other races


Next please look at the original questionnaire in Traditional Chinese at page 88

http://i.imgur.com/bFy8us9.jpg



The translation of the question is:

""26. For people with these background

a - with criminal record

b - different race

c - heavy drinker

d - emotionally unstable

Answer: (1) acceptable (2) unacceptable

i.e. the answers are not ""mention"" or ""no mention""

The correct result should be: In Hong Kong 78.1% found it acceptable to have different race neighbours

You can also contact the Hong Kong University Professor who conducted the survey (credited in the pdf).  He can confirm that it was indeed a mistranslation.

It is obvious that the survey result for those questions was inverted by mistranslation, and they ignored my request for correction:

http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/time-to-lead/multiculturalism/diversity-yes-in-my-backyard/article1736042/

I wonder if the Bangladeshis number is also mistranslated.  They don't give the impression of having random racial riot every month.

------

Edit: 
One of the comment on Washington Post linked to this post showing how the Bangladesh number was also inverted.

I'm currently staying in a large flat in Kowloon. My husband and I live in mainland China and wanted to take my husband's brother and his family around China

On his first night here

When BIL wasn't back by morning, but not be able (or willing) to do fuck all for some stupid drunk dude. And really, who could blame them? 

After talking to an officer for a few minutes, an ambulance showed up and he was offered medical assistance, which he rejected. So this guy is an absolute twat, the worst sort of gweilo, and instead of punishing him (which would have been fair enough, honestly) they kindly offer to help him.  

The cops put out an APB (or something) to officers in the area with his description. The found him about five minutes later. No exaggeration. He was driven to our police station where my husband and I could meet with him and bring him home. 

I'm from the States and, professional, and helpful, but downright kind. I have been to Hong Kong many times and like it a lot, but I have never been more impressed by the city state until today.

A very good friend of mine was hit by a truck while jogging earlier this month. He is now in a coma and his loved ones are in distress trying to make sense of it all. The case can only be investigated by police if there were any witnesses that step forth. Please support by spreading the word... we need to find a witness to this scene asap. Please help!

Edit: An update revealed it wasn't a hit-and-run. Changed ""hit-and-run"" to ""accident""",self,t5_2rbn0,1374824550.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/HongKong/comments/1j094u/my_friend_was_hit_by_a_truck_in_sham_shui_po_and/

**[TIME AND INFO HAS CHANGED

Please contribute to the [Google Doc spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At9XvZgnKkMAdDdQancteEcweVA0RFVvQ1R0cnByY2c&amp;amp;usp=sharing) so we can all have an idea of numbers and what food will be had!


**Original post:**

Thanks for the suggestions and advice everyone. It sounds like this'll be a new experience for many of us so I think this'll be a fun one.

Looking forward to an awesome chill meetup of tasty eats, good chats and blowing the water/shooting the breeze!

* **What:** BBQ at Repulse Bay Beach

* **Where and when:** Meet at Central (Exchange Square) Bus Stop at ~~1pm~~ 3pm

We will wait for about half an hour and then we'll all get on the bus Route 260 to Repulse Bay.

Actual location at Repulse Bay will have to be confirmed

* **How:** Everyone please bring your own beer and food.

If you know what you're bringing post up below so we have an idea what we have to share amongst us.

~~I would advise people have stuff ready at Central but we'll stop by the Wellcome and/or 7-11 at Repulse Bay/Chung Hom Kok Road

Closeby the meeting point there's a CitySuper in IFC Mall and a [Wellcome a little by further out.](http://www.wellcome.com.hk/en/profile_store.html?page=store&amp;amp;lang=EN&amp;amp;region=Hong+Kong+Island&amp;amp;district=Central)

Again

That's the best plan I can come up with. If any locals want to give suggestions or help please post up or PM me.

See you all there!

**EDIT**

[Please let us know if you're coming and have a think about what you'd like to bring for food in the spreadsheet here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0At9XvZgnKkMAdDdQancteEcweVA0RFVvQ1R0cnByY2c&amp;amp;usp=sharing).

&gt; The citywide hunt for a missing 19-year-old continued on Tuesday as classmates and family members turned to social media to expand their search.

&gt; Tsoi Kin-hau, from his home in Lam Tin’s Tak Tin Estate.

&gt; He left behind a suicide note saying he was suffering from academic pressures.

&gt; The note read: “No need to look for me. Call the police and tell them to find me. I have gone to a faraway place where none of you will find me. Don’t worry too much

&gt; Friends of Tsoi took the search onto the internet with a forum thread

&gt; Police said they had searched Lion Rock Country Park

&gt; Tsoi was last seen wearing a black, jeans and black trainers, and was carrying a black Nike backpack. He is 1.73 metres tall and weighs about 58kg.

I understand their nuances, explains it as 'we don't want to tell the truth that Hong Kong is basically New York City in Asia, because if that was the case, then we might as well just film in New York City), but there are a TON of things that irk me. These include:

- Guns. Why do so many people have guns in Hong Kong
- Difference between Mandarin and Cantonese. Films just dont care. Too many actors hired aren't speaking canto, one in Mandarin. Just weird.
- Non-Chinese actors playing Chinese people. Bad guy in one of the Rush Hour films
- Old-Hong Kong culture. Hong Kong is usually portrayed still as people using wooden umbrellas
- Tuck-tucks. Why do they still insist on having those in movies? I have only seen one in a museum and I've been here over 20 years.

I unfortunately did not make a real plan before I came but I want to come back very soon. I would love it if some of you who know the city could give me some ideas for places to go. I went to the Peak and the avenue of Stars

 I would really like to explore the lesser known places. I am especially interested in ""street food"" or small shops with great food. I cannot read much Chinese but can arrange a friend to come along if need be. (for  reading the menus) Plan an itinerary for me if you like. I do not want to go back to The States someday and have missed out on getting to know one of the world's great cities. I would just like to avoid the tour groups and maybe see your city a little the way you do.

I am a 27 year old Australian female with a Bachelor in Science. I am a qualified swim teacher, maths, philosophy and English. I also love to garden and take care of plants. I'm a native English speaker and am also studying Mandarin.

My puppy is very gentle with children and I think being exposed to animals is really good for child development. He's also super super cute and trained very strictly.

We will take the ""[family trail](http://www.discoverhongkong.com/eng/see-do/great-outdoors/hikes/lamma-island-family-trail.jsp)"" from ~~Yung Shue Wan to Sok Kwu Wan~~ Sok Kwu Wan to Yung Shue Wan (changing to route to allow more flexibility as the ferry from YSW back to Central is more frequent). It's an easy 2 hour hike. 

Afterwards we can choose have an expensive seafood dinner on Lamma Island

Do remember to wear comfortable clothes and shoes, and bottled water.

Anyone interested please leave a message below.

I'm thinking that it could be a way to develop a small community of gamers in HK who could decide upon a game and time to play every month or couple of weeks and play together online. It could serve as an exchange for Steam

If it was popular enough

Any interest in this?

1333626092.0,ruhmw,100 Must See Hong Kong Movies,dangercart,17,3,3,"Hi r/HongKong

I'm wondering if anyone has seen any of the [100 Must See Hong Kong](http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/CulturalService/filmprog/english/2011ms100/2011ms100_ticketinfo.html) movie presentations or is planning on going to any.  The Leisure and Culture department sponsors special screenings of 2 or 3 movies a month from classic HK cinema.  Each movie is played twice; once in Sai Wan Ho on a Saturday night and then the next Sunday afternoon in Yau Ma Tei.  The films are in Cantonese with subtitles and after each one there is apparently a talk (I assume in Cantonese) with a person from the film.

My wife and I are going to see the Jackie Chan classic ""Drunken Master"" on 15/4 (Sunday) so if anyone else is going and maybe wants to meet up for lunch before hand let me know.  In exchange for going to see that with me (a movie definitely more up my alley) I am taking her to see ""Homecoming"" and ""China Behind"" next month

If anyone has been to a screening already let me know what you thought.  It seems like a good deal (tix are cheaper than most movies) and we're looking forward to it.

In case anyone is interested:

1369504922.0,1f1f5t,A Layman’s Take on Foreign Earned Income Disclosure and Tax Reporting for US Citizens Living Abroad,jort,16,2,8,"Disclaimer: I have yet to file my first year abroad's taxes with the US and my taxes here in HK. I am not a tax consultant, and I can do that. But it would still be nice to know the process. That said

Filing US taxes while living abroad is kind of nuts. I can’t even imagine what happens when a person starts to own multiple investments [stocks (form 8938)

The USA is the only nation to tax based on citizenship versus the location of which the income was earned. Thus, a US citizen will always have to file taxes even if - even if - they earned no income in the USA.

Example: Imagine for a second if I were to have a child in Asia and raise it here for the remainder of our lives. This child would be a US citizen (due to me being one), they would owe tens of thousands of dollars and risk being extradited to the US for felony tax evasion. Yes, it really has the potential to be as crazy as this.

Moving on.

Roughly put, to qualify as having lived outside of the USA for 330 of the previous 365 days (otherwise all my income overseas would be taxable in the US). That’s step one; an extension to show I was out of the US for 90% of the previous year even though my 2012 taxes only go thru December of last year and relate in no way to this year.

The next item on the list is the FBAR (form TD F 90-22.1). Starting this year the US requires all US citizens/nationals/etc abroad to disclose all foreign held bank accounts. So, etc) including what the maximum aggregate value of the accounts (each detailed separately, but valued as a whole) were at any given time during the year (where the hell do I find that?). Not to mention, as a basic example, if I transfer $10,000 from account A to account B - now both are shown as having a maximum value of $10,000 during that time (if that was my entire income). A bit invasive and illogical.

The cost of filing the FBAR late (or missing it) - a $10

Next up, as the title may allude, mandatory. Everyone contributes. Sort of how Social Security is automatic - except MPF is more like a 401(k) type of deal. Here’s a national public retirement scheme which I am automatically enrolled in as a basis for working in this country, and the US requires I report it as part of their FATCA which was enacted to prevent tax evasion.

How is me disclosing mandatory national public retirement schemes helping avoid tax evasion? This one eludes me.
Then, right?

Not quite yet. I would file 1040 if I wanted to pay taxes on the income I did not earn while in the US. However

Luckily,100 earned abroad (form 2555). To qualify for this exclusion, US taxpayers must first show they live abroad through either being a “Bona Fide Resident” or by meeting the “Physical Presence Test.” My physical presence here in Hong Kong is being met, through the eyes of the US IRS, thru the use form 2350 - delaying the date in which I file my taxes in order to qualify as having been here 330 of the previous 365 days.
My take on the exclusion. Sure. Here is a piece that makes sense and is fair. Although the whole first year status is a little wonky. They act like people’s lives run on annual tax cycles. “I shall move to Hong Kong on January 1st!” The creative side of my brain just died; the logical portion fled in fear.

Lastly form 8938 is a supplement to your 1040 showing foreign held assets. I’m fairly certain I won’t be needing to file this one

And finally. Here is the point I have really wanted to get to. All this. All this is to report to the US IRS income you have earned abroad. Report accounts and assets you hold abroad. And to see if you earn a remarkable amount of money at which the US finally requires a tax payment. For most of us

And all of this has ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to do with having to file your taxes

The part where you actually file your taxes in the country where you earned them, have police protection, and enjoy, at best, a rather civil life here in Hong Kong.

I have been away from Hong Kong for a year. Yes

At the party are my girls' classmates and their parents. This is a group that you would least expect anger from.

George is typical of them. He is a self-taught certified accountant. He is no hot head.

He runs his own accountancy firm that employs 50 people. He doesn't have to worry about losing his job or business to highly competitive mainlanders.

George is a beneficiary of the mainland's booming economy. Business is good enough to allow him to pick up his son every day from school at 3pm. The value of his handful of apartments has more than doubled in the past few years.

His wife stays home to take care of their single child. Rising food bills and rents fuelled by mainlanders' buying sprees are not their concern.

They don't have to compete with mainlanders for hospitals beds or milk formula. Their seven-year-old is studying in a local school.

These people have little economic reason to dislike the mainlanders. Yet they call the mainlanders qiang guo ren

They call Tsim Sha Tsui ""the invaded zone"". They miss the good old days when they could stroll with their kids at Ocean Park without having to fight the queue jumpers.

They complain of corner-cutting in the work place and being told that ""this is the way it is in the mainland"".

They said they would leave the city for good if the subject of ""national education"" was forced on their kids. ""China kills its own people

Basking in the sun while the children built sand castles

It must be the frustration over the national education thing

I was wrong. On October 1 we gathered again,"" said one of the fathers. ""Well said,"" was the echo. That was two weeks after the government shelved the plan for the curriculum.

Most of my English-speaking colleagues found this pique difficult to understand. If the French could tolerate the noisy Americans and now the noisy Chinese on the Champs-Élysées

The quick answer is the Americans and Chinese don't have a say over France's political

In the colonial days

We were then thrown into the hands of a total stranger. That's fine because the stranger was the one in need. We poured in our money and knowhow.

By late 1990s

It hurt a bit

Then in 2003, stock issuers and tourists from the ""uncivilised relatives"". That hurt.

* **Agriculture and Fisheries sector** - 60 votes (and it shows how biased the election is when such a tiny industry is getting such a disproportionate number of votes
* **Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions** - 60 votes
* **Hong Kong Medical Association** - 15 votes (out of the total 30 in the Medical sector) 

All of the groups above are known to be traditionally pro-Beijing except for the HKMA. The bias in the election itself can be seen by how the very small Agriculture and Fisheries industry holds a disproportionate amount of votes (and the people in the election committee doesn't even work in the industry directly). The decision from the HKMA was what really surprised me. They sent questionnaires out to all registered doctors in Hong Kong and had a 12.5% response rate. Of these 1600 doctors, and 25.6% voted Henry Tang. However, 29.3% casted absentee votes. As a result, *all* 15 votes from the HKMA will be cast towards CY Leung.

CY Leung also had nominations from 293 members from the election committee. After subtracting the overlapping votes
