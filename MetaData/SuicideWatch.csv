Despite what the PMs claim

* The SW moderators truly cannot trace the source of any post.  We more than anyone else desperately wish we could sometimes.   The troll claims that this has happened in the past

* Calls to suicide hotlines do not regularly result in involuntary psych holds and expensive ambulance bills.   It's possible, and they understand that anonymity helps callers feel safe to speak openly.  They only betray confidentiality as an absolute last resort.  

* In almost all jurisdictions, the onus is on the caller to ask the question.  If you're concerned about confidentiality when calling a hotline, you are entitled to ask them what their disclosure policy is before you tell them anything about yourself or answer any questions.  (And it's always best to ask as politely as you can, understanding that you're probably feeling pretty rotten or you wouldn't be calling.)

* The PM claims that you can help your loved ones avoid suffering by killing yourself by one of the ""painless"" methods.   This is an extremely dirty trick of psychological manipulation

*  The troll is also subverting the mission and intent of Exit International.  Their Peaceful Pill handbook

I just told him I got really wasted and was just super tired and sick all day. I had taken three half-full bottles of pills.

1289335992.0,e3nth,Lessons from Four Decades of Depression,Me_and_Uncle_D,215,35,24,"My freshman and sophomore years in college were the worst.  There were several nights when I did consider suicide, depression differs from person to person.  I have a friend whose depression leads to anxiety -- such that he cannot sit through a movie without feeling pressure to worry about the future.  My issue is the opposite: I go numb: distant from everything; cut off from any sense of shared experience with anyone.  Crushing isolation.  And always the same hammering question: Why bother?  Why bother with any of it?

So why write at all?  Because sometimes just knowing someone has shared experiences can help.  It has helped me a lot.  ANd I fully understand that my coping mechanisms may not work for you.  But they might lead to something that offers a glimmer of light.

For me

My private list of poisonous things others tell us and even worse things we tell ourselves:

1:  ""I would be happier if only..."" If only what?  I was rich?  I had a girl?  I had close friends?  It doesn't work that way.  I found a great woman and married her.  My depression had a choking answer, and I am still depressed.  I must really be a loser.""  Grasping for external means to cure depression never has worked for me.  It may not work for you either.  Stop the ""Only if..."" thinking.  It is a never-ending treadmill.

2: ""I need to be happy.""  Not true

3: ""The future is hopeless... ""  ""Look at all the mistakes from the past...""  Never play time traveler.  It's another game where the house always wins.  The future is unknown and the past is gone.  Live here and now.  What I am doing right now?  What's happening around me?  Is it raining outside?  Am I hungry?  Do those french fries smell good?  Is that woman cute?  Is that man handsome?  When you start time traveling

4:  ""You need to get out!  Go to a bar!  Go dancing!""  Maybe.  Probably not though.  Not if you are introverted.  This well-meaning advice can cut like knives.  Be cautious.

5:  ""You need to get over it.""  I am sitting here loaded to the gills on hydromorphine, ""I'm trying, baby, I'm trying.""  Then I let it go.

What has helped deal with these bad lines of thought:

1:  The one thing all of the thought patterns above have in common is that they are directed inside: they are aimed directly at sufferer.  ""I don't... I can't... I feel... I need to...""  It's being kicked to the curb when you are at your lowest.  Take a deep breath.  Then get out of your skull.  It can be a very dangerous neighborhood when you are alone.  ""I can't.."" No.  ""That cat is pretty.""  ""The wind is really blowing.""  ""What was Thomas Jefferson thinking when argued with John Adams?""  ""What would it take to fix that window?""  Get out of your skull.  You are on the Titanic.  What could you do to save more people than they did?  Would Iron Man defeat Spider Man if they fought?

2:  Do something.  No, but I believe in my heart that people have this power.  Better still, these things can change the future we are so often worrying about.  Dreaded questions become (by the smallest of degrees at first) easier to handle:  ""Hey.  Long time no see.  Whatcha up too?""  ""I am learning how to cook.  Not very good at it yet, but finding my way.""  ""Cool.  What are you making these days?""  A conversation.  Such a small thing, easily overlooked.  But small things add up.

3:  Stop trying to capture happiness and instead let it happen.  You don't even have to know it at first.  ""The sun feels good on my back.""  That's all.  No pressure.  No unrealistic expectations of a miracle end to depression.  Small things.  Tiny steps.

I am not going to tell you any of this conquered my depression.  It would be a lie,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,t3_e3nth

All I can do is speak from experience. In my own unique experience myself, and other family members did not know that our son was hurting. His actions, words, and day to day activities did not give clues to anything out of the ordinary for him. He was a bright light in all of our lives. Very caring, very open.

Since the death of my son

I am not responsible for his death

I work hard at trying to connect with people who can get something out of what I have been through. Not for profit - to help. I don't have all the right answers and I struggle with even approaching the prevention subject

Much of what happens after the loss of a loved one by suicide is a personal struggle dependent on the relationship between the you and the one that died. The guilt can overwhelm and eat at you. It can put you in a place that your lost loved one was probably sitting in also.

I am a Mom that lost her child and is completely heartbroken by it. This has turned my entire life upsidedown and nothing will ever be right again. That is a fact - it has nothing to do with a self serving agenda. It has to do with life and death and grief and the struggle to understand suicide. You may not like my post and you may be angry by my post - but I am here to say that suicide shatters everyone close to you. Including the ones that you may not be thinking of - the one's that you may not realize love you. I know that doesn't automatically fix anything. I know that mental illness, I only have my experience of how suicide ends more than just one life.

First of all, **it helped you because you believed it**.  Sadly, that's not how it works for many of the most at-risk people struggling with suicidal thoughts.  

This is why

&gt; Don't disagree with suicidal people about how bad things are.  It’s not about their circumstances; it’s about their suffering

For our OPs who are in the lowest and most dangerous state of mind, including the overuse of the ""It Gets Better"" message, which originated in the specific context that adults aren't usually as emotionally immature as teenagers, tends to backfire.

",SQLwitch,140,49, and we're going to start removing them.**

Our reasons are:

1.  The vast majority of the ""let me help"" type posts come from people who have little or no history of constructive, having survived a period of suicidality and recovered may *sometimes* make you good at suicide intervention, but sometimes it makes you terrible at it. The bottom line is that we have no way to vet our helpers except through their *visible* contributions to the community.  

1.  Speaking of visibility, chances are you'll provide support and comfort to 10 suicidal people instead of just 1.  

1.  People talking to our suicidal OPs and lurkers offline can easily become [overwhelmed with situations that are more intense or dangerous than they can cope with](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/x80ja/what_does_sw_think_about_the_im_here_to_help_pm/c5m438s).  If the conversation happens with the whole community, and *everybody who's helping needs support themselves*.

1.  Soliciting PMs is particularly dangerous because it creates expectations that you may not be able to fulfill.  A lot of the risks associated with getting personally involved with suicidal people

1.  The highest value of the SW Community is that the interactions happen out in the open where people can be anonymous, sometimes you'll say the wrong thing, or miss saying something important that needs to be said.  Again, in real-life situations, the primary responder always has somebody looking over their shoulder, listening in, and offering suggestions.  

1.  People seem to make these posts in lieu of responding to the OPs who have taken the emotional risk and posted their stories.  Imagine what it's like to make a post where you put your pain and fear out there

1. These posts are essentially redundant; SW by nature is a place where everybody's either here to get help or give it.  Since our volume is small

##All of this is ***in no way*** meant to discourage anybody who needs help and doesn't want to post from asking someone in our community to talk via PM.   If you're scared to post even with a throwaway account, if you get a PM request asking for private help, we are **absolutely not** suggesting that you say ""no"".  If you get a request of that nature that you don't feel equipped to handle on your own, please message the moderators and we'll do whatever we can to assist.

A few months ago my normal dark place got even darker. Everything in my life seemed (and still seems) like shit. I'd been thinking about suicide every single day, and an oven roasting bag. I bought all the things needed to deliver my death. I would be unconscious within 30 seconds and dead in 20 minutes. Now I never wanted to feel like this was a decision I made in haste, so I left the supplies in the back of my car. I wanted to know the option was still right there, but I didn't want it close enough to taunt me on a late night where I knew all I had to do was slip a bag over my head and be done with it all. 

There were a lot of times I thought about going out and getting it over with. I thought about renting a nice hotel room so the last things I'd hear would be the crashing of waves on the pacific shore. Other times I thought about just driving to a remote parking lot and doing it in the car. I'd be far enough away to be undisturbed

Today, so that when the time came I wouldn't have to fuss with much. So, I went out to my car, and started carrying in the items. On my dining room table sat my DIY suicide kit. Pictures of balloons and words about children's birthday parties adorned the side of the boxes. Most people who bought these were looking forward to celebrating another year of life, and I bought them with the intent to do just the opposite. 

For some reason, but I wondered if I could get my money back. It was this one thought that made me decide that what I was planning to do wasn't right for me, at least for now. The fact that I thought about getting my money back. Something like that doesn't matter in death, so why was I concerned about it?

Right then, and asked if they would make an exception and allow me to return them beyond their date. They said, ""No problem."" I was allowed to change my mind. Now I can't say how long this will last. Something terrible may happen to me tonight and tomorrow I may be buying those tanks again, but I know that I at least have given myself another day.

Please read.",Sad_sister,122,10,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/khqx0/in_honor_of_my_brother_he_committed_suicide_a/, and countless friends.  I wanted to come here and tell my side of the story.  And tell the brutal truth, but mainly I am focusing on my story.  

He was 32.  He had Bipolar Disorder, but he came to in the middle of it and realized it wasn't what he wanted.  He crawled to a phone and called 911 himself.  He was a grown adult, he lived 4 hours away from the family, and he did not want us treating him like a baby.  Standing over his shoulder and jumping at every inconsistency in his life not only felt wrong (though unavoidable), but I know it only made him feel worse and fed his depression.  So I tried to back off and give him some room to make mistakes like a normal person......  

I noticed his lack of presence about 3 days before his birthday.  No one else had mentioned it, and I thought maybe he had shut his internet service off.  I decided to wait to call.  I figured if I hadn't heard concerns from anyone else, I would wait until his birthday, because I had planned on calling him then anyway.  So his birthday rolls around, and when I try to call he didn't answer.  I knew this would happen, and the feeling of dread rose worse in my stomach.  Then his ""girlfriend"" sent me a message, asking if I had heard from him.  She hadn't since nearly a week before.  I knew then what I knew 3 days earlier, asking anyone if they had seen/spoken to him or if they could go check on him.  No one could till the next morning.  At 7:45am, the neighbor and his SO have not been the same since.  They stopped talking to anyone familiar with Him.  The man even ignored my mother when she tried to introduce herself and apologize for what he had gone through.  My mutual friend was given the horrible weight of having to call and tell me.  I can't imagine how difficult that must have been.  Being 4 hours away from each other
brother and his wife, full with the feelings of failure.  

Skip past the full day of crying and the haze of disbelief  as we made endless calls to hospitals, funeral homes, etc.  Skip past being told that the body had been there for an undetermined amount of time and had started decomposing.  Skip past being told that the body was unidentifiable and the forensic investigator was waiting for dental records to make a positive ID.  Skip past being told that, ""There isn't anything left that you could identify.  And even if there were, I would never let you.  You don't need to see this.""  Skip past knowing that there was no chance to ever see him again, even just to hold his hand and say goodbye.  

The next day we made the 4 hour trip to his house.  I rode with a bottle of Pepto in my hand and a never-ending feeling of complete nausea in my stomach.  I had the tiniest bit of hope because no one had yet mentioned the thing I feared.  I figured it would have come up in all the talks.  We were the last to get there, ""Are you ready?""  I truthfully answered, ""No.""  Then she said it.  What I was more worried about than finding anything.  She said, ""Now, they said it smells pretty bad in there.""  OH. GOD.  I had held it together as well as possible during the ride, but that..... I didn't want that.  I broke down instantly.  I ran to my mom's arms and sobbed uncontrollably.  Your sense of smell is the strongest in being tied to memories, and I didn't want to have to experience walking into my brother's house and smelling his dead, there was nothing to do about it.  The smell was everywhere.  The entire house was filled with the aroma of death.  It wasn't quite what I thought it would be.  It was like a mouse that has died somewhere in the corner of your house, just out.  In the room

Fast forward to the next day.  We came back with supplies in hand, I experienced the most surreal moment of my life.  By the time my husband and I got there, my mom and her SO were in the process of cutting out the carpet where he had lay.  I only saw the underside of it.  But even at that, I saw the large circle of blood that had soaked through.  Apparently there were maggots covering the top.  Everything had seaped through the carpet and padding and onto the concrete below.  They took the carpet outside to air out and to help with removing the smell.  Then my mom got a bucket and sponge to scrub the floor.  I told her she didn't need to do it, to let me clean up.  But she wouldn't let me.  So I sat on his bed and watched.  Looking down at my mom, on her hands and knees scrubbing up the blood of my dead brother, I felt removed from the situation.  In all honesty, but it wasn't what happens in real life.  People don't experience that in real life, she replied, there are companies that specifically do this sort of work.  Everyone failed to tell us this

But here is what I really want people to know.  After we found out and settled some, poured in with messages and comments.  Some were your run-of-the-mill sympathy.  A sort of, ""Oh hey, I knew that guy in school.  He was pretty cool.  That's sad.""  But some, most actually, were truly devestated.  So many people wrote to Him or me, pouring their hearts out.  SO MANY PEOPLE LOVED HIM.  He had no idea the affect his death would have on others.  Friends and family, some who I didn't, just to say they are thinking of him or how there is still a light missing from their lives.  So many messages of people saying

I've known I was this way for a while but I never could let my parents know...or any of my super religious family for that matter. They lost it when they found out. Mom cried. Dad yelled. I was thrown out on the street despite the fact that I told them I have no where to go. Absolutely no where. I stayed two nights with a friend of mine but it's not something I'll be able to keep up since his parents will be home in a few days. (They were on vacation and he lives with them.) Since then (Monday night up until this point) I've been sleeping in my car in a parking garage. I have no food whatsoever. I have no gas whatsoever. I can't believe my parents just wrote me off like this. 

I even tried to call my mom on Tuesday hoping it had been enough time to calm everything down. I asked her if I could at least come have dinner or something and they said no because ""my dad doesn't want to sit across the table from a faggot.""

I'm just so hurt and I'm somewhat ashamed of the fact that I'm attracted to other guys. I guess it's because I've been brought up being told it was wrong. 

I really don't know what to do or think. I can't understand how parents not only kick their kid to the street with only 30 minutes notice. They won't let me come back and told me they'd mail me my clothes but everything else was technically theirs because they either bought it or supported me which took money out of their pockets so essentially they believe even the things I purchased are theirs. (Computer, etc.) They won't even give me a meal or answer their phones for me. I just don't understand how they're perfectly fine with their only child going hungry and sleeping in a parking garage. 

I don't have many friends but now I feel even more alone. My family was the only social communication I really had and now my cousins aren't even allowed to talk to me (They're under 18.) Not only do I see no way of fixing the situation,False,,t5_2qpzs,False,,,t3_1in3xi

Officer _______

My name is Id_rather_be_eating.  You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/drugged out of my mind.  I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me.  

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was.  You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am.  There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night.   I had a relationship end with a girl I moved for after only six months, and a number of other chronic issues.  Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much.  Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years.  I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II.  It has the highest suicide rate among all forms of depression.  

Most of that night comes back in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined.  You are very clear presence throughout that memory though.  You were professional, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours.  To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me.  You weren't supposed to.  I'm glad you did.  Since then, I've gone through quite a few changes.  I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life.  I feel shaken, and good.  

I have no idea what your life is like.  I don't know if you love or hate your job.  I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you were just as lonely as I was.  I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life.  You were a calming presence for my family when you eventually talked and they wish to say thank you as well.  I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and somewhere, he thinks of you often.  I will never forget you.

Quite a lot has happened since I last posted here. I'll start by saying that I'm not actively looking for a quick/painless/easy way out anymore. Over a week ago I was out with friends when I blacked out again. Until that point I was just living life like I always would,5 month I had has been cut in half. Weirdly enough that was the least of my worries as I had to explain what was happening to my friends. Doctor-patient confidentiality prevented them from learning about what was happening while I was out and they wanted to know. There was no point in lying anymore (I didn't actually lie before..I just didn't tell them..unless maybe when they asked me 'what's up' and I'd reply with 'nothing much').

Telling them that I have only a few weeks left was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. In the hospital

Anyway, and I'd rather be out of the hospital). That OceanSkys guy who's also dieing kind of inspired me to not end it myself. He's having a great time and to see everyone care so much makes me feel a lot better. I signed some papers that will keep the doctors from reviving me if my heart stops, and to pull the plug if I ever turn into a vegetable, so I won't have to worry about that anymore. I've been having a good time with my friends and will be until the end. As for my bucket list..it remains empty. There's really nothing more I'd like to do than to hang out with my friends. Although I might loan all the money I can at a bank and donate it all to charity..it's hard to collect debts from a dead guy, haha.

It's one thing to say ""don't do it for the people you'll hurt"" but I think it's another to hear exactly what you will do to your family. Please take a moment to hear my story and consider the value of a life.



On June 2nd of this past year my mother came home with police. My dad had left a suicide note in his car at a personal location nearby and was missing. When people use the expression that someone's words felt like being physically hit it is not an exaggeration. When my mom said he'd left the note I almost fell over. He'd been fighting depression for a few years but it was under control

Then comes the part most people don't think about. The police report where you have to prove you weren't involved. Those horrible phone calls where you hear your mom have to say over and over ""I'm so sorry

It's over. Everyone withdraws and you and your family are alone. The world outside keeps moving even though yours stopped days that seem like years ago.

""In case you've never overdosed, and all around enjoyable experience.

That's a lie. Now I will (lightheartedly
 
First, ""Was it at least mesquite?"") Anyway, once you chug that shit like it's the worst 4loko you've ever tasted (it's worse than that) approximately one minute later you puke it all up. Everything you ever had in your stomach goes BLACHHHHH out of your mouth and it's gross as hell. Then you're supposed to drink this clear juice (I forget the name 'cause I was groggy by then... EZ flow? ironic...) that's a super strong laxative. At that point I was on the verge of passing out, so they decided to give it to me another awesome way - through my NOSE. I know, you're probably wondering how this magic trick works. Well, they shove a tube down your nose, down your throat (insert really disgusting blow job-esque gagging noise) alllll the way down into your tummy. And then they pour cold liquid down it and it's just... so much fun. Definitely recommend it, blah blah blah it sucks.
 
Meanwhile! I got stuck with so many needles I can't even count the bruises all over my arms and hands at this point. When I saw my brother after a few days we took him on the ""bruise tour"" to try and count, so I don't think I'll be able to pull that one off. Suggestions for alternative lies are welcome as long as they're not ""Say you're a heroin addict!"" Oh, and later in the shower I found a gigantic, bright blue bruise on my gut. I was completely unaware of how I got it until my mother told me they injected me with anti-clotting medication through a giant needle while I was passed out. Well, okay then.
 
Anyhow. I'm vaguely aware they took me in an elevator and up to the intensive care unit. I had an IV of saline and an IV of the laxative into my nose and an IV in my hand for blood drawing and heart monitors hooked up to a machine and a periodic inflating blood pressure cuff and my own tv, though I'm told I woke up sometimes and insisted on being disconnected from my many wires so I could use the real bathroom and not a bedpan because I WANT MY DIGNITY DAMN IT and said really mean things to my mom and the nurses. Oops. They had me sign a form to admit myself voluntarily to the psychiatric unit and then apparently I accused the woman of bullying me into it? Oops again. Apparently I was possessed by the devil - later I kicked a chair and said ""fuck you!"" and I do not remember that. Cool.

So then I graduated to the delicious clear liquid diet

In conclusion, no matter how hard you try. Many end up in comas, brain dead, partially brain dead, etc.

I'm not great now. I still struggle with so much shit. I may attempt again in my life

A book that has gotten me through other times when I wanted to kill myself has been ""How I Stayed Alive When My Brain Was Trying To Kill Me"" by Susan Blauner.

1323024819.0,mzysm,From: a sister left behind. ,dontthrowurselfaway,108,11,23,"My little sister just killed herself. She (I'll call her Nicole. Not her real name)  had just turned 18. She was supposed to graduate high school this coming May. She was supposed to go to college. She had just gotten engaged. She was pregnant. I promised her I would help her take care of the baby while she went to school. I let her and her fiance live with me. I tried my best to make sure she wouldn't have to worry about anything. Apparently I failed. 
Our mother died when I was 17 and Nicole was only 4. Her father took her for a few years until I had graduated and was financially stable enough to seek custody. I was denied twice
Especially on the inside of her thighs. 

I saw red.

I called the police

The years passed with Nicole becoming more and more erratic and depressed. She started drinking when she was 13. That's also when she started cutting. I noticed blood on her pants once, because I didn't know what to do. She told me I was ""fucking useless"" and she should have ""stayed with dad."" That hurt me most, considering everything he had done to her and all I tried to do was help. But after a lot of fighting, she finally agreed to go. In therapy, she was unresponsive and bitter, or she would make up stories to tell the therapist rather than actually talk about her problems. 

When she was 14 she started skipping school a lot (I got a lot of phone calls from school wondering where she was) or when she was in school she would fight with everyone. Some people tried to bully her, I got angry phone calls and visits and emails from parents of girls Nicole had beaten up and stolen things from. Grounding her didn't work, and I was so nervous to do anything that might hurt her or trigger something that I mostly just put up with it all. 
When she was 15 she started dating a 23 year old. I was definitely not ok with this and told him to leave her alone or I would call the police. She sneaked out with him one night and broke into a neighbor's house to steal things to pawn for drug money. Yes

I immediately reported it and she was returned only 2 days later
I admitted her into a psychiatric hospital. I brought her blankets and pillows and her own clothes and pictures and books from home so she wouldn't be horribly bored. I brought her pizza during visiting hours so she wouldn't have to eat the hospital food. I tried so hard to take care of her but she refused to even look at me. She only said three words to me the entire 3 months she was in the hospital. 

""I hate you.""

This crushed me. I told her how much I loved her every single day. I didn't even buy myself a new *bra* in 5 years because all my money went to taking care of her. And I mean every last penny of it. I slept on the god damned floor of my bedroom. I didn't buy myself a bed so she could have a big canopy bed and a computer in her room. I ate baby food (only 20 cents a jar!) for lunch at work so I could give her lunch money for school. I sacrificed everything to take care of her. And I never blamed it on her. That was my choice. I did my best to make sure she didn't KNOW how much I was struggling to take care of her. I gave up my 20s. I'm in my 30s now and haven't been on a date since I was 19 so I could always take care of her. But the only thing she could say to me was ""I hate you?""

I let it go. I just kept my head down and kept trying to make her happy. She started dating this boy I thought was bad for her but I said nothing because he seemed to make her happy. She started smiling again. I heard her LAUGH. I hadn't heard her laugh in over a year, but I let it go because I was so overjoyed she was finally doing ok. 
Then she told me she was pregnant. She seemed manically happy about it... like the happiness was artificial. But I figured I was overthinking it because it was so rare that she was happy I just didn't know what it was like. Then her boyfriend proposed to her. I thought it was a bad idea considering how young they were but once again I said nothing. 

Two weeks ago

Today is the first day I've come out of my room since. Nicole's fiance moved out. I'm not sure where he went. I think he told me from the doorway of my room before he left

She left no note. No reason
She was going to be a MOM. She was going to be a WIFE. And she was my whole fucking world. I don't have any friends. I don't have a lover. I have my boring job that I dealt with so I could have money to care for her. I had plans for my life that I gave up on so I could take care of her

Now
She's gone now. She feels no pain. She just left me to deal with it. It was cruel of her. So now I'm stuck thinking about all the times she told me she hated me. She never told me she loved me. She never said thank you for a single fucking thing. And now I've wasted a *decade* of my life and it obviously didn't mean anything or help at all because she still quit. 
And I will never know how she really felt about anything or why she decided to opt out.

I am here because I have seen other posts where you guys have been extremely helpful to people.

I am currently in the states while my brother was back home in India. He had some plans to startup a business and had been working really hard at it. I had called him yesterday to discuss his plans and ended up telling him it was too risky. He agrreed to give it up. Three hours later I missed a bunch of calls from him. After calling him back he started telling me how much he loved me. He was clearly drunk. He apologized for a bunch of things and asked me to tell him a good memory of us. He also asked why i didnt call him more often. I was busy driving so I said I'd call him in 5 mins. I did but he didn't answer any of my calls. I thought he went to sleep or something. This morning my parents called to come home ASAP. He committed suicide.

I don't really know how to deal with this. I didn't even say I love you to him when I said I would call him back. I am currently at the airport on my way back.

&gt;stay in this world. There are soo much things you didnt do or saw. You have the honor To live. Go out. Walk around listen to the birds watch the beatiful nature. No one ever could take you the beatifulness of the nature. Life is wonderful. Set a goal. Try to do things you would love to do. Hope you will be fine again. Everyone will help you and with this post you shows that you want help. There are soo many people in the world that want to be your friend.

&gt;You should try going for a walk. Think of nothing but the birds and others sounds of nature around you. It will clear your head. Also find one person who you trust to listen even if it's not your family and talk to them about your problems. It will get a big weight off of your chest and you may even find that they don't hate you as much as you think

&gt;Such infinite minutia to enjoy on this planet. We are on the cusp of witnessing an awakening of minds to each others

&gt;You are not unwanted, I don't trust meds. Never have, never will. Worked for a few people I know. I never needed them.
I'm sorry you feel so down. You shouldn't be unhappy. I know that feeling of losing control

And so on. Let me clear something for yourself - we do not want to do anything. We don't want to wait. We don't want to see unseen. We don't want to enjoy nature. The only thing we want *is to feel happy*

See, suicidal person. Average humans starts his day by waking up, stretching a little bit, saying hello to sunshine and everyone who lives nearby him, and then proceeds to do his chores. Suicidal person is woken up by feeling intense pain, both physical and mental. He lays on his bed. Maybe for a half of hour. Maybe for an hour. Alone with his thoughts, his hatred on life. And if the intense urge to go to the toilet defeats him - he stands up

See the difference?

Fucker.

Oh, then) and someone from HR last Friday (a week ago, then). I specifically asked if I was in trouble, and she said no; there had been no complaints about my work whatsoever.

I went in, and that I'd need a doctor's note before they'd consider hiring me again.  I told them that this job was the only thing keeping me going, and that if I hadn't been suicidal before, you can damn well bet I was suicidal then.  That's when the pink piggly fat fucker from HR handed me a suicide hotline number and said words that I literally could not hear because I was so goddamn angry.  I tore it up in front of his jowly balding face and asked if I was free to go.

I punched myself in the face on my way out of the lobby, so they only gave me a warning not to be suicidal again, *or else*.  Right around then is when I called the fucker who I thought was my friend, and within an hour of hanging up on him I was under arrest and locked up in the crazy-house.

I'm not sure what lessons to have taken from this episode.  Here's what I think I've learned:

* Never show any sign of weakness

* Society hates suicidal people

* Trust No One

* There are worse things than dying

* Suicidal people are the perfect victims for bullies such as employers, because they can do whatever the fuck they want to us, charge us money we just don't have for it, and earn the praises of society for both ""helping someone in need"" and sticking it to suicidal people.  Also, we don't fight back.

Now I just need to figure out how to die in a way that inconveniences as many people as possible.

Of course, or how those benefits will ever be enough to pay for any of the bills I have.  Tell me how I can escape everything by declaring bankruptcy despite having no money for a lawyer and being unable to discharge student loans except by paying them off or dying.  Tell me how I'm supposed to sue my employer even though they'll say they fired me for poor performance rather than being cray-cray, or how no lawyer will take the case for as little money as it represents, or how goddamn long it takes to get a case through court.  Tell me how I still have my youth or this is just a goddamn phase or how ""it sure looks like you're having a rough time, but hang in there it gets better."" Yeah, tell me **HOW IN THE FLYING FUCK THINGS ARE SUPPOSED TO GET BETTER, OR WHEN, even though my ""friend"" ratted me out to the cops and is the reason I have a criminal record now and spent the week in the crazy-house.

And I'm not trying to insult any of you.

I want to help.  I want to help these other people.

And I want us to help them more effectively.  

Please consider this question:

When YOU are feeling upset about something

The overwhelming majority of posts in this topic are the kind of thing you wouldn't get in a face-to-face or a telephone call, thoughtful, but more effective engagement could be made through smaller chunks of dialogue.  A real conversation.

My worry is that there are a lot of people helping out by posting what they think a suicidal person would want to hear

Instead, commands, anecdotes (some of these are very empathic, which is good) from faceless strangers suggesting that ""No, you shouldn't"" or ""No, please don't"".  * I am worried that they came here hoping to find an ear, and instead they find a thousand mouths.*  

What I am advocating is that you can be more helpful by asking pointed questions.  Questions that guide them toward introspect.  This approach is based on a simple truth: That *no one can solve your problems but you*.  Questions that get them thinking about their situation and how maybe it's not so bad.

* What made you feel this way?
* When did this start?
* What would you like to see or do differently?
* What do you wish you could have done?
* Is there anyone you know who might share that interest?
* What do you wish they would have said about you instead?

It is more effective to ask a question that guides them to probe themselves deeper.   Get a response.  Ask another question that guides them to probe themselves deeper.  Get a response.  Repeat.  

In this way, but it encourages the suicidal to **find their own solution to their problem**, which is way more relevant and motivating than having someone else command you to do something.

In this way, this approach will guide them towards the exact issue they need help with.  If they just want to rant and vent, it will be made obvious by this approach.  Let them tell you what the issue is!  Sometimes our first mental draft of a problem isn't the actual issue, it's just a symptom.  Only by letting them get to the root of it can *the correct problem* be solved.

**TL;DR** Listening is better than talking.  [More](http://www.google.com/search?sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=reflective+listening)

It's true that everyone gets depressed from time to time. ""She broke up with me, however, is an entirely different issue.

There were a number of reasons I made the attempt that are spelled out in the letter.  I'm Biploar type II.  I'm posting it here as someone who was in a really bad place, please ask for help.  I was incredibly lucky.  Things get better.  





Officer ________

My name is time_better_spent.  You met me on the night of Nov. 9 when you pulled up to my car and found me passed out/asleep/drugged out of my mind.  I hope that kind of scenario is rare enough that it stands out and you remember me.  

I'm writing to say thank you for everything you did that night. I had taken a lot more pills before even getting into my car and what you found didn't begin to describe how dangerous it really was.  You stumbled on my failed suicide attempt and I can't put into words how thankful I am.  There were a number of things going on in my life that led that to that night.   I got dumped by a girl I moved for after only six months, and a number of other things.  Everyone thought I was this perfect, smart, funny guy who had no problems and the stress of wearing that mask while hurting inwardly was just too much.  Mostly though I was clinically depressed and it had gone untreated for about 15 years.  I've since been diagnosed as Bipolar type II.  From what I read, it has one of the the highest suicide rates among all forms of depression.  

Most of that night comes back to me in flashes and I'm not sure what actually happened and what I imagined.  You are very clear presence throughout that memory though.  You were professional, the only one I look back on as a calming influence on what was a very anxious twenty-four hours.  To be honest, I'm utterly shocked that you found me.  You weren't supposed to.  I'm glad you did.  Since then I've gone through quite a few changes.  I've been properly medicated, I've started therapy, moved away to be near family and a better support system, and finally have some clear and attainable goals for what I want to do with my life.  I feel shaken, humbled

I have no idea what your life is like.  I don't know if you love or hate your job.  I don't know if you have a great family life with tons of friends or if you are just as lonely as I was.  I just need to let you know you made a real difference and I will be indebted to you for the rest of my life.  You were a calming presence for my family (who I heard you talked to) and they wish to say thank you as well.  I assume you'll be working in law enforcement for a long, please just know that way back when you saved a man's life and that somewhere, he thinks of you often.  I will never forget you.  

Again

I am 36 year old married man with 2 kids aged 6 and 4.  I recently discovered Bitcoin during the the big spike that was on the news. I bought them when they were around $200 each and I was extremely disappointed when they went down to around $100.

I wanted to find a way to get more value for the coins I had bought and recover the loss in value. Then I discovered Satoshi Dice. I found you could gamble with your Bitcoins and double your money. 

Well, and then lost about $20,000 worth. I was so ashamed of my loss that I dug into my home mortgage fund and gambled $40,000 away. Within 1 week it was all gone.

Even if you are reading this at a time of heartbreak, know that everything will be all right. Nothing is ever going to end up as you expect it to, but you will come out of all of this just fine if you keep a cool head and a semi-positive disposition.

When the whole world feels like it has wronged you, just by seeing the positive. Even if you’re seemingly really and truly trapped—be your captor a physical illness, the ever-present depression, the impossible colleague, or the waiting game of romantic half-commitments—remember that you will get out. Everything changes. You’ll never be caught for too long, especially if you put your mind towards untangling yourself. Let go of the self-pity, and learn to accept.

In that same vein of acceptance, you can and will start over.

Remember too that other people are just like you. They get hurt for stupid reasons. They say things they don’t mean. They’re ignorant sometimes. Sometimes as fragile and defensive as you feel. Apply patience. Try not to be so hurt by what they do. Their actions and words don’t have to affect you unless you let them.

Finally, it is controllable. You are the one keeping yourself in the dark. While it hurts to live, you know that the main reason you want to die is to (finally) affect other people. To make them acknowledge you at last. But you can only truly do that with your active actions. If you die, you’ll just be forgotten. You know that there’s too much you don’t want to miss, so why bother even considering ending it?

Remember that it isn’t always like this. When you’re happy

On New Years Eve my girlfriend ignored me. I wanted to spend it with her

I found out the next day that she had drunken

She then systematically ripped down every piece of self esteem I had remaining

I don't know if I left anything out. I can barely think. My body feels like it's on fire. I have felt this before

I want to be dead. This is it. I've fantasized about it so many times but I simply want it now. I am way too fucked up to live. Every single insecurity I have was ripped apart by her and pointed out with a spotlight. Every little piece of self loathing that floats around my brain was amplified 100x.

This is it. I don't believe in god, I made a plea to the universe to show me that I should stay here. Here it is. The sign I was waiting for, to tell me that I should die. It won't get better. It gets fucking worse and worse. I have never hated anything as much as I hate myself right now.

I'm simply a disgusting

And I still love her. My mind is so twisted. She ruined me and I still love and care about her. I hate myself for that too.

I can barely see anymore so I'm done writing. I don't know how to deal with this. My entire body feels like its on fire. I could never explain this feeling in words.

The police kept asking me if I was going to initiate my ""plan"". I started to watch what I would say. They asked if I was a danger to myself. I lied and said no. I kept telling everybody there that they were fucking morons and finally asked one of the police officers if I was being forced to go somewhere. He told me that they were called to take me to the emergency room but they couldn't since I apparently wasn't a danger to myself and that if I would have answered yes to any of their questions they would have forced me to go.

I was hospitalized for a week. I was miserable. Things in my life... they suck massively right now. My life is changed forever.

But while I was there, or who were hearing voices telling them to kill people. Guys who would shit themselves and not realize it, but who would sit there at group therapy and talk about how sad they felt because they didn't want to be in the hospital, they wanted to be out in the world having relationships with people.

It was depressing... and it was eye opening.

A lot of these people were there because they had SERIOUS psychological disorders. There was no way they would ever, ""I'm nice to people""). I came to really care about these individuals.

And I realized what a fool I was for being so conceited as to think that my absence from this world would not affect anyone else; that the problems I was facing were enough to rip me out of the lives of those who cared about me. I thought about how devastated I was when my aunt committed suicide

I thought about all the low-income, to help... and how, without me, they might not have that chance. Even just the homeless guy on a park bench who might want somebody to talk to--that I wouldn't be around to sit down and have a conversation with, to brighten his day.

SW, your life does not end here. Don't let your current state of mind fool you into thinking that EVERY SINGLE INCH of your life is worthless. Even the stupid little inch that you don't think matters is important. This world is a fucking terrible place, and not staying around to do your part to make it better is an insult to the rest of us. There ARE people who care about you. By removing yourself, you are leaving behind more pain in the world. By using the resources that you have (us, and look in the sidebar), you can improve yourself. You can't make the sucky stuff go away. But you can change the way you react to the sucky things that happen. Shit isn't going to stop happening. Awful, horrible, and to let them know that it gets better.

You are a wonderful, push on--as *painful* as this step can be--push on, and help others push on, because we need you, because you need us, because we all need each other more than we actually realize.

I love you, and you can insult me, and you can be cynical and angry all you want, but that's not going to change how I feel. You have such potential. Your vision is just clouded right now. Please at least consider what I have said. Please, stretch your mind just a little bit to the possibility that these words are true. You are not a waste. Your world has not ended. Your world, your most important chapter, begins with you making the choice to press on through the most difficult time.

Let my anguish have some meaning. At least let the hell I've gone through do something for you. I am thankful that you are alive.

I would first off like to apologize to my mom and dad.  You have both been nothing short of amazing parents, but I promise it was nothing to do with either of you.  The most powerful force keeping me from doing this sooner was the thought of what it might do to you two.  Unfortunately the pain eventually because too great, and I needed to act more selfishly.

I’m also very sorry to you

As for why I chose to end my life, but I don’t even want to be lying in bed right now.  I don’t want to do anything at all.  I don’t want to exist anymore.

I feel as though nobody understands me.  I once maintained an idealist fantasy that love could save me from my demons.  I thought love could finally make me happy.  I was right, I can’t be happy on my own.  So, what does that leave me with?

I know I’m acting selfishly.  I know I’m inevitably hurting others around me.  I know I’m a coward for doing this.  But

I have faced this before.  I have dealt with anxiety and depression for the majority of my life.  There was always some force keeping me alive.  There was always a part of me that still wanted to be alive.  I believe now that part of me is losing

Thank you to everyone who showed me kindness or support.  Your efforts did not go unnoticed.  This is nobody’s fault but my own.  I hope I am remembered well.

I love you all.  Goodnight.

So this is my story. I don't know what to do... The woman I've lived with for years... All in a sudden.... And now she wants my kids

**EDIT: Wow, but I still can't believe this. Sometimes I wish this was just a big joke played on me, like these reality shows. I'm thinking about all these years together (almost 14 in total) and can't believe I was so blind to all the hints. I explained all I could in great details in the other post but had to remove some ""edits"" from that post. Here they are reposted in case somebody wonders:**

____________________________________________________________________________

EDIT: Thank you for the valuable advice so far. I can assure you this is very real, nor done anything that could justify a divorce. I have written this whole text a bit quickly and under the emotion. Yes, we did had little fights, but nothing really serious. Some dates are back to november. I simply don't understand...

EDIT2: Background information: I am 35, then I remembered kids were there. I told her: ""I don't understand. And I really don't understand why you did this in front of the kids"". I told her I wouldn't argue in front of the children and that is when she left, telling me she did not feel safe anymore and would go with her parents. She told me she would tell the children and I almost agreed since they would have more people to be with, but I seriously feared she would attempt something. ""The kids stay with me,"" I said. We argued and she finally left. She said she did not feel safe, I felt she was going to party. I am not a violent person. We did had minor fights in the months before, but nothing serious. **I have her phone number. I tried to call her twice and she did not answer. Should I try to call her again? Please tell me. I have no idea what to do...**

EDIT3 Thank you to the downvote patrol! You've made my situation worse and prevented me from getting potentially valuable advice

EDIT4 I have been advised by a close friend of mine to go file a police report. This might be important for what is happening next. I have called her again and got no response. He told me not to call her again to prevent the harassment issue. To the best of my knowledge she is with her family so I could call there. My own friend wouldn't believe what happened and called me a liar several times, but I see the potential issue), some old data and strong alcohol. My biggest fear is for my children. I will keep this updated if people are interested, looks like I will have a long night.

EDIT5: Thank you SO much for everything so far. Lots of things happened since this morning including a meeting with the police. I never saw that coming. I was so dumb. So exhausted. I now know much more about what and why this happened. I am very busy right now (not that easy to find an attorney on a saturday

Every goddamn day it's the same exact shit and I'm fucking tired of it. If I were dead, she'd go stay with her - her problems would be fixed and I wouldn't feel this pain anymore.

Strangely

I'm 14 years old. It's a shame I was never really able to enjoy my youth.

I never really had any good friends. My parents always thought I was overreacting when I said I was severely depressed. All my parents cared about were my grades, I wonder how they're going to feel? Secretly, I hope they feel extremely guilty.

I'm in a deeper depression than ever before and it makes me regret not acting on the suicidal urges I had when I was younger. I want to fall asleep and never wake up. I want to be involved in a fatal accident. I want to take all the painkillers I saved up from years of oral surgery

How do normal people do it? How do they make life worth living? How do they keep going, dread and guilt? I’m so miserable at the end of the day that I start bawling the second I get in my car, and I don’t stop until I physically can’t cry anymore, long after I get home. I put on a happy face as much as I can, but all the while I’m holding back a flood of tears and the ever-increasing urge to harm myself. 

My coworkers have noticed a change in my job performance and I hear them gossiping about how ""lazy"" I’ve become. How can I tell them that the reason my work has suffered is because I am constantly holding back the urge to climb up to the roof and jump off head first? Its escalated to the point where I've become something of an office joke. The second I turn my back I hear insulting comments about my professional and personal life. Yet they won't fire me

If this is all there is, whether it comes tonight or in 60 years. I’ll be dead before too long and an ass print in an office chair is the only legacy I’ll leave behind. If that’s the case, why even bother taking up space in the world?

I sit behind the same desk every day, arms and legs until it chunks of skin pull away. The pain offers a moment of relief from all the horrible thoughts that constantly bash themselves against inside of inside my skull. 

Every weekday morning there’s a panicked screaming inside me that says “NO! Not there again! PLEASE don’t make me go back there again! PLEASE!” …and then I walk inside. I stuff the panic and the dread and the self loathing deep down so I can pretend that everything is fine. 
It gets harder every time and there’s no end in sight. At least my draining, or all the others just like it that I might able to get in the future, assuming I live long enough.

This is completely jumbled because my emotions are running high right now... ask questions if you don't understand.

Well I tell her we need to tell someone and get him kicked out of the university. She won't do it because she doesn't want her parents finding out.

I can't eat or sleep. I am usually very athletic and I have gotten out of shape drastically due to my depression since I found out in August.

Not too long ago I came to /r/suicidewatch looking for some chit chat about my life, actually nothing I read, or any of the advice I received helped me out. 

A day after making that post I began to write my suicide note, as well as a good bunch of notes I had addressed to them. I thought doing this would let people know how truly sorry I was for going out like this, and how much I really cared for them. I spent anywhere from 6-8 hours working on this very detailed note. 

After writing my note I headed off to Home Depot to pick up the supplies I needed to kill myself with my car exhaust. I did the setup on my car

I woke up at 5 am to begin a complete cleaning of my house, ""If I would put this much work into searching for help, maybe I would get it."" I stopped right there, took my suicide note and decided to go on a walk as I reviewed it. I started to look at all the people I cared for, and noted how much I actually cared for them. Even people who were not part of my life anymore, such as my churches preacher, my mom's best friend's grandmother

Many of my problem revolved around money, the fact I had lost so much, owed so much, and would only be looked as a disappointment to those around me. I will say here that I had quite the subtle ego, I faked being humble so people would admire me more (it was so egotistic). 

As I was on this walk, even though I was no longer religious and never would be. 

I wanted to talk to him, especially the part where he could do nothing to stop me, and if he called anyone on me it would only make me go in a more brutal fashion. After explaining him the situation, it was hard for him to wrap his head around it, he had always thought I had things together, but he really had no idea this was coming. 

After a long discussion, where he could give me a speech. Instead he took me to the bank, and he withdrew enough money for me to get out of this horrible place. In so many words he trusted me to pay him back at some point with my business, and never told a soul about this meeting.

If you told me a I would still be alive today, even more so. The moral of this story is to not use your loss of hope to get what you want, it's to reach out to people who really want to see you live, no matter how unlikely you think it would be. My ADHD has created a lot of self doubt, and they may be why I was so reluctant to look for help, but low and behold the first person I ask to help me, solves all my problems. 

So before you give up, and just go talk to them no matter what makes you want to leave life. I was literally eleven hours away from being dead, and breaking many more lives than just my own.

Jump ahead just over a year, insightful - a truly amazing young woman...only she didn't think so. And for a brief time of madness, neither did I. We were doing long distance which proved taxing from the start and we were stressed out over college and jobs. One day I finally threw my hands up in the air and told her we needed to break up. We had a huge fight and I said that I wished I had never met her. I never meant it for a second. I loved her more than anything else in the world, but in a moment of utter stupidity, I lied. That night she called me at 11:00, 12:30, 1:00

The next afternoon I got a call from her best friend instead.

This was about 18 months ago now and I finally feel I am coming to terms with what happened. But I will never 'get over' it. As others who have lost loved ones to suicide will tell you, there seemed to be no end to the blackness that my life had become. I've tried to forget, but after coming here, everything came back all at once and I had to fight back tears. I just want you to read my story and think about the implications of your actions. If you EVER feel, as I did, that no one will notice or care, please remember that someone out there cares more about you than anything else, no matter how embarrassed you feel. I'd rather be woken up every night for the rest of my life than know another person died thinking they were alone. There is always a way out,,

I'm going to kill myself.

I'm going to fall.

I'm going to do it after seeing my mental health counselor early next week.

It's better that I die.

This isn't my first time planning my end.  I faced a decision when I turned 20 to either kill myself or take action on my transgender feelings which had been plaguing me since… about as long as I can remember.  I went into it knowing damn near everything about the process

I'm 24 now.  I was on hormones for most of the last four years

I pick my skin severely, face, and legs from torso to knees.  This started in high school, which was quite stressful.  I mostly pick in the bathroom, which has been a constant source of stress as long as I can remember.  I have issues pooping, or, well, inspecting the toilet paper after each wipe.  Typically the toilet paper is blooded by the time I'm done wiping.  Family and friends have noticed this behavior, if it's not terribly messy you can fold it again after the first wipe for a second.  Spitting on the toilet paper also does wonders (for the baby wipes folks or whoever).  I'm sorry about the detail.

I'm incredibly bothered by farting

I have many friends who are wonderful and genuinely care for me.  I can't talk to any of them about any of my problems.  I can't burden them.  I hate to burden anyone.  I'm scared if I don't kill myself I'll end up burdening the people I care about more and more.  I can't allow that possibility.

I've been seeing a counselor person since I was planning on killing myself last

I don't feel the counselor has helped, and didn't particularly enjoy the side effects.  They now have me on lamotrigine.

I hate myself for all the stupid decisions I've made.  From 18 to 23 I've been employed as a web developer, I felt secure in that aspect of my life.

Then I lost my job.  I wasn't fired, burning through my savings instead because of my obsession with not wanting to be one of those people who exploits the system.  I was just stupid.  I've been stupid a lot.

I've held a few jobs that didn't last long since then.  It's been very hard finding work.  I wasn't able to handle the stress of my last developer job.  I've completely lost faith in myself as a programmer.

While I hold no love for myself, I've tried to not let her pay me, but she insists.  She is wonderful.  She is concerned for me and frustrated by my behavior, which is entirely reasonable.  This is why I can't share with people, it just hurts them more.

I never know what to fucking say.  I've never shared this much before.  It's not like I haven't tried to get over this… I know I'm weak… but I'm not entirely without hope

When I was 15 (I had just turned 15 a week before this), and had herself a nice little bush. So there I was with this girl who was really showing me some attention that none had ever shown before. The last thing on my mind was asking for ID or doing an age-check. We really hit it off until her mom found out and called the cops and said I raped her.

I got locked up for a couple months while waiting for my trial. Luckily her mom was pulling so much shit out of her ass it was obvious she was lieing and I got off. She was saying things like I had locked her daughter in a dark closet and forced sex on her, it was 2pm, and we never even actually *had sex*. So i got off on rape, but because of our ages I still got fucked over for sagitary rape. Though different then rape, people didn't care. I get in trouble for something with the word ""rape"" in it and I'm a rapist in everyone's eyes. Sagitary rape? He must beat women and rape them!

It really sucks being brought down to the level of a rapist. That's something that just doesn't go away like that. I had threats, girls avoided my like a plague, people who I thought were my friends turned, and I got more then a few death threats. Needless to say I decided not to go outside that much. I've spent a most my time alone since then, and even though now that things have finally blown over, the effects are still here 11 years later.

Everyone that knows about that incident are either dead or have moved. But all that time I spent alone has really screwed me up. I can't socialize, or even talk to random people normally. I've been really trying hard to be more social, but it never works, I always come off as a little bit weird *and I know that*. I go to bars and drink alone never meeting people. At school I sit alone and never meet anyone. I try and start conversations or reply back when people talk to me, but something always gets screwed up. I've come to the conclusion that I'm never going to make any friends or meet a girl. I've also come to the conclusion that I'm not going to be one of those pathetic 40 year-old guys that are in the same position I am in now, so I'm going to end it here before it gets that far. Fuck, I can't even make friends on the internet! I have AIM open all the time with not one fucking friend, I might meet someone to talk with...yeah right. I've stayed positive up until this point. When talking with others I *do not* talk about anything like this; I keep it positive and don't seek pity.

I have left a some details out to keep this short, and sometimes it scares me what I might do if I snapped. So I'm not going to let it get that far. The only things I want in life I have finally realized I'll never obtain; kids, a wife, friends, and happiness. There is no reason either other then the fact I just can't talk with people in person vary well. I'm in a pit of loneliness with no way out and no one knows I'm here. There's no help.

In one week I'm going to stand on some out-of-the-way train tracks and let that giant piece of steel crush me. I think it will be a fitting end. I honestly don't even remember what it feels like to have the soft warmth of another person holding me in a hug. Every time I think of that it just kills me inside

**EDIT:** This will be my last reply. You are all vary kind, landscapes, hobbies, arts, sciences, and more. I love it all and I'm sad to leave it, but that's *my* decision. 

You see, empty, and unappealing. My schooling was being paid for by the government because my father was injured in Vietnam -- this was cut off when I hit 25. I can't get work no matter how hard I try, I can't afford school anymore, and my parents are losing their house in a few months. To put it simply I'm going to be homeless, I can't find work, finishing school is no longer an option, zits

When I die I'll be happy with the fact that I tried as hard as I could for as long as I could, I'm not after happiness any more, I'm after peace...I just want peace. With all the effort I've put into improving my life these last 5 or so years there hasn't been ONE thing that's improved. Statistically I think *something* should have gotten better, or at the vary least shown some sign of improvement -- it hasn't. If you are playing a game that you absolutely suck at, you can only keep at it for so long before you just turn the damn thing off. Understand?

I thank you all but this isn't a bad thing, or a group of friends who care about you, I would strangle an infant with my bare fucking hands to know what that feels like for an hour. Most people have things they can look forward too and improve -- I'm no longer one of them. I'm actually happier now then I have been in a long time. Knowing this pain isn't going to matter soon is a real relief. It's like I can finally relax without constantly caring about these things I so desperately wished I could have obtained. Right now I'm calm, relaxed, and happy. This is bringing me peace.

P.S. You are all vary nice people and I hope I didn't mislead any of you. :( Don't think that you have failed in any sort of way either -- you didn't. My mind was made long before I came here. It was nice talking to you all but it changes nothing. The fact is I *need* this. If I don't then I'll probably just turn into some pathetic homeless drunk that has completely given up on life. I can end it now or walk around like a mindless zombie essentially dead anyway.",,t5_2qpzs,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/94ty3/im_done_im_not_living_like_this_any_longer/

I don't know who you are, and that no one deserves to be miserable.

So, troubled child of the world. Dysfunctional, depressed, anxious all the time; you know the works. 
I'm 19, drug abuse, suicide attempts and ideation. I've been hospitalized a good 4-5 times and I go to a mental hospital/institute every day for school. Everyone I know struggles with depression or some sort of disorder. All of my friends have gone through the same things. 

I know the most amazing, interesting community then the people who share these issues.

I know people who have tried to hang themselves multiple times, and knows me better then anyone. 

If you're considering taking your own life, you are cared for, no matter who you are. Life is difficult, and depression (no matter what anyone tells you) IS NOT a choice. You don't choose to be depressed... It happens. Suicide isn't a choice, it's a decision you will never be able to change. 

I know life is hard, you don't want to change, you can't change; you just seem to be stuck with nothing to do, but you can get help. It's the hardest step to recovery but I know it's do-able. 

If you need help the first step, get help. Talk to a councillor, talk to a therapist if you can, if you're at the point that you can't stand it anymore, go to the E.R.

thank you

thank you again. take care

Dear Dad

As I write you this letter, you had a steady job and a family. When my mother was my age, she was almost halfway through her Ph.D. We were a family.

I have nothing to show for myself

By the time this letter reaches you

It is a shame I relinquished my insurance policy back in 2003 or 2004. Though I suppose no money would have come from it

My mother is quite ill, and I do not think I want to know. The truth is painful. I have my stepfather and his family, but I do not want to be a burden on anyone. I am always in the way, always causing problems, even when I try to do the right thing.

I would appreciate it if you could assist in handling my matters in [name of city]. My cats will have been in the care of someone else by the time you read this letter. I have filled out all the forms for student loans so that the debt will be gone. You just need to send proof of my death along with the forms. I tried to pack up as many things as I could. I am sure a professional company can do the rest. I have requested to be cremated and that my ashes will be scattered into the Atlantic Ocean. This is my final request.

I have been dealing with this mental illness since the age of 12. I know I am an awful person and have nobody to blame but myself

I hope you and your family will live in happiness. I hope nothing but the best for [my half-brother]. Please do not be hard on him as you were on me. I do not blame you for the way that I am now

Regardless of all that has happened between us

2 weeks ago an opportunity presented itself where I was able to leave the ward and so I quietly gathered my things

I knew I had to find somewhere secluded and vacant in order to successfully put an end to things. I wanted nobody to find me.

Now

I was absolutely certain I was going to die. I cannot find the words to properly express how I felt that day. I felt like a ghost.

So, I remember looking at my hand and seeing it shaking violently, I felt drunk, but something seemed very different this time. Once I had finished all 96 pills, I felt an intense wave of serenity and calm flood through me. My vision began to fade and I remember everything turning ""silhouette black"".

It was at this point

**what if I had waited one more day?**

What if I could have had one more delicious meal? One more loving encounter with my parents? One more laugh at a stupid joke? I have abandoned everyone I know and I will never see them again.

I didn't panic or suddenly seek help. I just remembering thinking *what a waste*.

The next thing I remember

It turns out a taxi driver had badly needed to relieve himself and had pulled up against the side of the road. After walking through the bushes to find somewhere private

An ambulance was called and as we raced to the hospital I began having a seizure followed by respiratory failure. I was put onto life support and my parents were called. They didn't know what was going to happen.

If it hadn't been for that man who found me

I have lived through this experience and now I know:

**SUICIDE IS NOT AN OPTION**

If I had died that day, that would have been the end of everything. I would have entered the abyss, the nothingness, the eternal end.

I was different then everyone else and always felt alone and that no one else really liked me. I was fortunate that none of my attempts at suicide were successful and I eventually worked out my own reasoning for not. I am now married with 3 children and living in the same town.  For the last 6 months I have become aware that my 16 yo son is beginning to have a lot of the same feelings of isolation and depression that started me on my downward spiral.  We have talked a lot about his feelings

This past Wednesday I received a call that my son had been hurt in a skiing accident.  It didn't sound serious at first and my sister, but it was another chaperon who was letting me know that things had gone downhill and that they were now calling for a helicopter.  She advised me to just pull over and wait because they weren't sure where they were taking him yet so I pulled into a parking lot and my world stopped moving.

After an eternity, but I was at least 10 minutes away and that would be pushing it. So I broke down again as I pushed the limits of night time driving on a country road.  I was going entirely too fast through a small town when I caught the eye of a friendly state trooper who pulled me over with less than a mile to go.  Fortunately, it only took one look at me and my rambling explanation for him to take immediate pity on me and let me continue.  I finally arrived at the resort parking lot where the helicopter had landed and sprinted to the ambulance.

I rushed onto the ambulance to a scene of utter chaos.  My normally laid back and easy going son was a monster.  6 people were crammed in the ambulance trying to hold him still enough to put an IV in.  He was screaming out in terror begging for someone to help him because these strangers were attacking him for no reason.  I had been an EMT when I was younger and knew that his altered state of mind meant trouble.  I pulled myself together so that he wouldn't see the fear that was coursing through me.  I stroked his hair and told him in as calm of a voice as I could muster that Daddy was there and that he would be ok.  He looked up into my eyes and nothing registered, and I was in shock the rest of the time on that ambulance.  They finally got his IV in and were able to sedate him and put an air tube in to protect his airway.  As they made the final adjustments needed to get him on the helicopter I kissed him on the forehead and stepped off of the ambulance and fell apart.  My sister picked up the pieces and drove me to the hospital which was an hour away.

We got to the ER and met up with my wife and my son's mother and her husband.  We waited for an hour with no real news until they finally told us they were moving him to ICU.  They ushered us to a new waiting area and left us in the dark room for another hour.  Finally, they handed us a sheet of paper and said we wouldn't be able to see him again until noon the next day.  After a long night of a little restless sleep we were informed that they would start removing him from sedation at 6:30am and take the tube out of his throat soon after.  At 7:30 they let us go in and see him just for a few minutes.  As soon as we went into his room he piped up with an inside joke between us and I knew he would be ok. 

We spent the rest of the day watching him slowly return to the boy we all knew and loved and he was released late that evening.  The next day was a revelation to him.  As soon as he got access to his cellphone and a computer he began to see the truth of how much he truly meant to everyone.  Both his phone and Facebook were filled with a constant stream of concern and care for him.  I was able to have a deep conversation with him that evening about how I noticied how much he means to a lot of people.  For the first time in a while he seemed to notice and acknowledge that he wasn't alone in this world.  I know that there will still be tough times for him still

I hope that you are able to find this revelation in your lives without going through what my son did.  Each and everyone of you have people in your lives that love you and deeply care that you are well.  Each and everyone have people in your lives that YOU love and deeply care about.

Ever since I was a little kid, I knew it was something that couldn't be fixed. As I got older, I started becoming more and more depressed and disgusted with myself, especially my appearance. I figured out the reason shortly after puberty: I wanted to look like a girl. I tried to shake off these thoughts for years, but now I'm 17 years old and I'm living in agony. I know I'm probably being overdramatic and whiny about it, but this has been tormenting me more and more over the years and now it's almost too much to bear. I used to try to distract myself with books and video games, but now not even that helps. I can't watch/read anything that has any sort of happy people inside, especially the women. I can't eat

I know about hormone treatment and transitioning and all those things, (by Canadian standards at least), and by coming out to them I'll have to make my parents choose between supporting me, or having the support of literally all of their friends and family. My extended family is even more conservative than my immediate family, and the only friends that my parents have are people from our definitely not LGBT-friendly church. I know that I should live my life for myself, not my parents, but the fact remains that I'll never be happy without their love and support.

Even if I do get past these hurdles, and my facial features are far from feminine. I've seen pictures of people who turn out fine anyway, but I'm sure that there are tons of people who don't and just don't put their pictures on the internet. I'm sure nobody's going to want to hire, be friends with or date someone who looks like a guy in a dress.

I've tried speaking to a lot of people and nothing seems to have helped. I haven't found any therapists who could help me, and I don't know if I'll be able to wait the two or three years it will take for me to become independent from my family either... I know a lot of you are probably grossed out or bothered by my condition, but I've really exhausted all of my other options as the moment. I've been having thoughts of suicide ever since I was 10 or 11 years old, but they've gotten so much worse over the years that I'm now regularly considering whether or not it would be better for me to just end it all. I know it would hurt my family, but coming out would hurt my family too, and at least this way they'd have some sort of support network to help them. I just feel so disgusting and ugly and worthless and I just want the pain to stop. I'm sorry...

Please don't assume that the people posting here just haven't been shown how good they've got it *compared to some*.  We are aware that there are other people out there with problems.  That does not fix ours

Please don't assume that those of us who speak of the wish to die/kill ourselves have never considered the impact on our friends and family. There's a good possibility we have, whether we've considered that side of things or not, we are not at the point of wanting to die because we are selfish human beings. We are there because we are in such great pain that we don't know how to cope anymore and are willing to take that final step just to make it stop. Consider it euthanasia for a disease nobody else can see. There may be - there very possibly is - a cure that will allow us to live with depression or even overcome it. That cure will never be ""well you'd be a jerk to do that to your family, just how selfish are you?"" Reminding - or even convincing - someone that they are loved is a good thing, but it should be approached with a non-critical POV to avoid feeding the voice of depression.

Before you start posting responses to people with some very severe problems, both there and elsewhere, but let me stress two ""don't"" points:

* When helping someone who is depressed, further lowering his or her self esteem, and making the depression worse.
* When helping someone who is depressed

There.  That's done.  Now

Try not to use the following words/ideas in your post:

* this is such a stupid post
* I'm sorry to waste everybody's time by typing this
* I'm such a whiner
* I'm sorry my post is all messy and long
* I must be weak and a failure to be talking like this

Getting your fears out is good, the sooner you post, the sooner you start draining the poison out of your mind.  Read through some of the posts.  See how many people who are just like you have passed through here, posted an apologetic note, and received strong encouragement and advice.  Depression and SuicideWatch are here for *you*.  The thing that would be *bad* to do would be to *not* post and ""try and get through it alone.""  Depression loves it when you isolate yourself - so don't give it the satisfaction!

Also, don't react to it.  Downvote it and then pretend it doesn't exist.  The majority of us want to see you get better, and the few dissenting voices among us are not worth listening to.  In fact, the more they echo the thoughts you yourself have been having, *the more wrong they are*.

I have never been as alone as I am right now.  I have no one else to talk to.

The girl I love decided to date my bestfriend.  I've known each an equally long-amount of time.  About 7 years. She's going through a divorce, from her and her husbands first fights while still in a relationship to the death-throws of their marriage dissolving.  I've been as good a friend as anyone ever could.  Friendzone.  All that shit, blahblahblah.  I did not like her this far back.  I was involved in other people.  Wanting more than just her company came about a year ago.

I wasn't going to act on it during her divorce because that would have been grody, but still was hooking up with my best friend while he lived in the home.

My best friend knew too that I liked her.  Totally shit all over my cereal with that one.  That guy even kicked my teeth in while we were drunk

She was very curious as to why I decided to stop being friends with the guy she's dating.  I gave her my reasoning, because of how I was behaving toward my friend whom she is dating.  I figured she would have just left me alone in exchange for her relationship with him.  But she did not.  In fact she grew more affectionate, and I grew more and more confused.

I figured there was two paths from my actions of discontinuing being friends with whom she is currently dating and remained her friend; and they were that A) She would leave me alone

And so it came down to B.  I had visited Florida the week before and sent her all sorts of pictures and spoke with her a lot while I was down there.  Several hours a day.  When I returned to my homeland, and I did not want her to feel that way.  So I told her that I was jealous.  I told her I was jealous because I like her.  I wasn't going to do anything or act on it or even bring it up until she had her shit squared with her divorce, but I had never got that chance because she hooked up with my best friend before any of that happened. That I was bitter.  I want to be mad at her.  I know a lot of it really is her fault, but never would have been if it weren't for my feelings.  

When I told her, but she hugged me and wouldn't let go of me.  We stood holding each other in her living room for as long as I could keep my breathing controlled.  I had to pry her off of me.  When we pulled away, she had her face turned very far away, presumably to keep me from kissing her, or to keep her from kissing me.  

It's been a week.  We still talk every day.  She said she didn't really know how to respond to me

I feel so alone that my love was not accepted by someone whom I tried my hardest to keep safe, for so many years.  Love has never been too kind to me.  Each and every one of my long-term girlfriends were cheating, crazy bitches.  I feel not worthwhile, not worth my salt, when I try so hard to make people feel good.  To make things better.  To sacrifice myself for others.

I know that I won't be able to continue this, but it's been so hard finding that.  It's been so hard that it feels like it's not them, and that it's me that's fucking up so badly.  Not just lady-friends either, but friends in general.  I get along with co-workers and colleges wonderfully well, but it's all shallow.

I just I don't know really what's up.  It isn't just this issue

Then we in a clearing sit

We to talk the pain of it

Of how she tired with razor cold

To end her life and not grow old

I grew up in a very conservative household.  I was never allowed to go out unless my parents new the parents of my friends and we were chaperoned.  This happened until I was about 15.  My dad was what you call a ""dry drunk, I would be somewhat tougher.  But verbal abuse was my prison.  My mom was too scared of my dad and did nothing to stop him even though her methods of parenting, as I would find out later, were mostly perfect.  Anything anyone did in my house would be double checked to make sure it would not anger my dad.

As for my schooling, that at the most there were 4 kids in my class.  We often shared classes with the adjacent classes (for instance, a class that was taught to the 7th and 8th grades simultaneously).  This meant that we were stuck in an atmosphere with next to no diversity.  My friends were only the few that were in my grade and the grades near mine.  I also happened to be the weakest and the ugliest, mix that with no confidence and you have the perfect storm for emotional turmoil, a.k.a., me.  However, I was raised to please people.  I seemed like the happy go lucky kid that was everybody's friend.  I happened to believe this myself sometimes.  You have no idea what bottling emotions at that level does to someone.  I was constantly teased for every mistake I made because I was the guy that you could push around.  Whenever I did try to fight back, life started getting a little better.  I was given a few more privileges and started making more friends.  High school was actually somewhat decent.  Even though my dad was still making the home life miserable

My second weekend at college I got a visit from my dad.  The car was packed with all his belongings and the family dog.  He was leaving to live with his family in Virginia (I lived in Rhode Island).  I found out that my family had a huge fight during my first weekend in college.  We had family fights before, sister and I were going to have to sell the only place I have ever known as home and move to Delaware.  My world was changing rapidly for the worst.  This is when URI sent me a letter saying that because I did so badly the second semester, they were kicking me out.  I dropped the letter as I read and became frozen in despair.  I entered the deepest depression of my life.  I love stand up comedy, rock and roll, ice cream, playing guitar; but none of it could even make me smile.  The only hope I had for a positive change in my life was now gone.  I had thoughts of suicide before, but now was the only time I actually had the will to execute the thought.  I walked to my parents' room to get my dad's shotgun ready

After I thought about it, I decided on my own terms to see a counselor.  By July I was happy.  I found a job through a friend, I was able to hang out with friends because my asshole dad was 600 miles away, there was hope that we were going to stay in RI and I was re-accepted into URI's college of engineering.  Life was better.  However, we became broke and I was unable to afford to attend URI and we had to move to Delaware.  My friends and family prepared to see me dive into depression again, but one thing was different: I didn't give a shit and I was happy.  Why?

I learned something.  Life is not about pleasing others or living up to their expectations.  Things change and you have to deal with those changes.  I simplified it into something I call ""The Three L's.""  Let me show you.

1) Learn:  No matter what situation you are in

2) Love: Love what you have!  And I know you have plenty to love!  You are reading reddit right now, but it truly is a miracle that you are a living being.  There is so much to love that you might not even notice!  I know that sometimes it's hard to see the good in some things but I assure you, there is good out there.

3) Live:  Live with what you have.  After you can see what good there is, we must live with vigor to explore not only the world we live in, but ourselves as well.  

I know you might be going through a very tough situation, no education and, most importantly, no worries.  Let me apply what I have said to my own life as an example so that you might be able to do the same.  1) I LEARNED that in order to be a good father I need to give my kids room to learn on their own.  I can get good education for a cheap price and I can go any time.  Friends are easy to make, just start talking about things you like and see if you spark an interest.  It goes on and on.  2) I LOVE that I have a roof over my head, pillows on my bed, a computer that can access any information or communities that I desire.  I have family that cares for me and that is willing to help me.  I could talk about everything

To summarize: Don't give up, love and live; you can do it!  Here is something I do when I get downtrodden: I look at a random object and think of why it is amazing.  At first, it might be hard to do, but once you get the hang of it, it can instantly help your mood.  If I could put everything I said here in one word, it would be, ""appreciate.""  Life has its downs, once you find the right track

Because he always used over-the-counter pills, we should have realized that he was using those pills because he couldn't get his hands on anything stronger.

I dropped out myself at the end of the semester, whose house was nearby but who seemed incapable of dealing with any human emotion, least of all his.

After a couple of months of living on his childhood savings account, decided to move out west, and talked Chuck into coming with him. They settled into a one-bedroom apartment. Harry took the bed and Chuck settled into a permanent spot sleeping on the couch. This didn't surprise anyone who knew Chuck. He had the lowest self-esteem of anyone I have ever called my friend.

Chuck found work in the new city but it was always terrible work

Almost a year went by. I was still working in the college town, like those gas station gigs.

Then came October 1980, they said, and to give me a ride to the concert.

Only Harry wrecked the car the night before we were supposed to leave. We were stranded. We had our Springsteen tickets

That is

We all went to the train station the night we left. Chuck and I sat on two of those hard plastic-shell chairs at a corner of the terminal and laughed our butts off

So he got me and Harry out of town on the train and went back to his parents' house. And on the night of Oct 20

The call came early, using his pillow and blanket in a futile effort to find, as Kris Kristofferson said, a way to hold my head that didn't hurt. Harry answered the phone.

It was Chuck's mom

I will never forget that hammer shot of astonishment

I remember stumbling out of the apartment and walking three or four blocks to a neighborhood bodega, and realized I had left the apartment barefoot and stepped on something sharp at some point. I never felt a thing. Except for shame. I tried to apologize but the owner just kept pointing at the door and yelling.

I used to get sad every October

Sometime in the past year I realized, who was a huge Lynyrd Skynyrd fan, killed himself on the anniversary of the plane crash. That sent a chill through me.

And of course like so many humans

We were both 21 that day. I suppose he still is. I have a wife and kids

I'm typing this on a laptop in the basement of the house I've owned and occupied for more than a decade. I've seen and done so many things I am grateful for having experienced, confused kid.

If you're out there Harry and you recognize yourself in this story

Everyone else: hug the ones you love for me and Chuck today. And if you have a friend or relation who seems unable to get free from their demons

She follows me around Reddit down voting everything I post and tells everyone I beat her when I didn't because she knows it will make people feel sorry for her and it will hurt me.

I'm in love with a woman who would be perfect for me.  Problem is, to see her in the hospital, her boyfriend wouldn't go see her and only called to bitch her out as she laid sick for a week now.  That is, until he heard I was going there.  He *does* beat her, puts her down constantly, does not get her insulin, will not let her see a doctor until she is deathly ill, and when I got there I found out he was coming

I have children I never get to see.  I am disabled, and I call them as often as it seems I can without annoying anyone.  But although my child support is paid, I haven't seen them in two years.

I could go on.  My life, I will be homeless some unknown time in the future, at least for a transitional period.  I'm college educated too with two degrees, but can't find a job I can hold.

Bipolar leads to suicidal thoughts.  I'd be locked up if I admitted to an authority that I have a foolproof

I **WILL NOT** die.  You know why?  Because of the crapfest that is my life

So, even when sentenced to a life of guaranteed repeating hurt, it **will** get better.  Remember this.  Repeat this.  Think of all the times you wanted to do it, and all the times after that you were glad you didn't.  You've won this fight so far.  Keep kicking ass because it can not beat you.",,False,,True,t3_di7n0

I've never posted to /r/suicdewatch. I don't doubt that there are a lot of you out there posting looking for someone to connect with. I'm sure this is the worst you've ever felt. I'm sure you've been dealing with it for a long time. But know this...you don't want to die or you would have done it already instead of posting to a subreddit. I'm not trying to take any of that away from you. I get it. I've been there many times. No one is trying to take those feelings away from you and you are justified in feeling shitty if things are really going that shitty. I just want you to consider things from the point of view of someone who has been there

I've attempted suicide. Three times. The first time I chickened out and called 911 right away.  No harm done. The second one was much more serious. I had health problems for a good year after my second attempt.  My dr's said I was lucky not to have sustained brain damage. I know what it means to be fucking miserable. Thankfully I've never had access to anything like a gun because when I'm in that frame of mind

And I'm here to tell you it doesn't have to be that way. There is lots of help available for those who seek it. Even those who are seriously mentally ill or dealing with a serious drug addiction...there is help (I'm both seriously mentally ill and have done drugs). You think you're all alone

You only have ONE life. No matter how shitty things may seem you are responsible for finding happiness and fulfillment. People can help you get there but you have to WANT to get better. I know...you are probably thinking that of course you want to get better.  You want nothing more than to get better. But think about what a big life change that means for you. It can be a little scary. Sometimes we hold on to our bad habits. It is not your fault you're depressed but you can't let it become a way of life for you. It shouldn't define you as a person.

Let me tell you, I wansn't even showering or brushing my teeth. Days bled into one another.  I cannot tell you what a mess I was. I wasn't going to work. I got fired for not showing up. I literally did nothing but lay in bed and sob. So I decided to take about 75 Tylenol PM. Fuck it...I knew it was going to be painful and wold take a long time, but I just could not stand to spend another day feeling like that.

Well, tripping on Tylenol PM while I wait for my liver to shut down...it was painful. I vomited blood. I still didn't call 911. I drifted in and out of consciousness. At some point I became aware that I couldn't do this. It was too painful. Nothing had to be worse than slowly dying of a Tylenol overdose. So I called 911. Thank God it wasn't too late. I have no idea how long I was laying there until I decided to call. I had no concept of time. But THANK GOD it wasn't too late.

I was in the hospital a long time. I have damaged my liver. I was also on a heart monitor. When I finally was released it was to a psych ward.

Have any of you ever been to a psych ward? It is the most depressing place on earth. All you do is sit and watch the clock all day so you can talk to a dr for a few minutes. You don't get any real answers. You just need to not be an immediate threat to yourself or others. Everything you do is watched and noted. It's enough to make you paranoid. Every little thing you do or don't do

So after a while you are released and then you have to pick up the pieces of your life. You think people are going to let you forget about this? No fucking way. You are always going to hear about this and everything you do from now on will be judged accordingly. Friends, they can't fire you for it outright, but they will look for ways to cut you if they can. It won't be related to your attempt, but you would never have gotten let go or disciplined otherwise. It has happened to me.

When I woke up after this attempt I was so fucking depressed. I just lay there day after day. Seriously did not move from the same spot for weeks. I didn't do anything to take care of myself . All I could think of is that I wish I had been successful

Don't do it. Just get help now. Call a suicide hotline. See a doctor. Even go to an ER if you have to. Checking yourself in as voluntary to prevent you from doing something works out a lot better than seeking treatment for something you already did. You're not in there as long...just enough to get over the hump. You will have no lasting physical damage. Your relationships will sustain much less damage that way. People will be proud of you for making the right choice instead of ashamed of you.

For those of you who are thinking that they will do something much more definite and final than overdosing...well, hard road. I've been going through this shit for 13 years now. But here I am and I either have to make the best of it and try to be a happy and productive human being...or just give up and never leave my bed again since dying is obviously not an option for me. And it shouldn't be for you.

Just just don't fuck around...it's not a game. If you need help

1301334271.0,gda1i,A fellow redditor saved my life on Skype. We just abruptly stopped talking for good. ,project941,51,3,9,"I am severely depressed. It's debilitating. I'm in an outpatient program now. A couple of months ago she asked for help on Reddit and I thought I could help so I responded. Doesn't matter what she needed help on

One day a close friend and I talked about the turmoil in my head. Those of you who were in my situation know of the pain, frequent crying and feeling of pointlessness. Simple hopelessness. I told her that I just wanted the pain to go away. Being a sympathetic person she said that she understood why I would wanted to end it. Despite knowing better, I convinced myself that I had her approval to end the pain. I was lonely and scared but determined to let it all go black. 

That night my skype companion was online as I was making preparations late that night. I told her my intentions and proceeded to swallow handfuls of different benzos. I was not in a rational state of mind I know now. She pleaded over and over with me to get help. But she was on the other side of the world and could not do anything other than that. I was determined to go through with it. I even had a quote from one of her favorite bands that I wanted to send to her to say goodbye. She kept typing urging me to get help. I was scared. I was alone. I realized that my final words would be seen by this person so far away. 

About 15 minutes after i swallowed the pills I still felt nothing. Years of Benzo use and abuse for anxiety built up a tolerance in my body. It was happening more slowly than I expected. I was even more scared by now and so alone. I asked her if I could video chat with her so I could just have a little comfort of seeing a live person before the benzos kicked in and I tied the plastic bag around my head. She obliged for a minute or so

I hate myself. I don't care about myself. When I wake up after sleeping I feel anxiety and disappointed that I have to be conscious. But this person whom I've known for a few weeks seemed to really care. The guilt that comes with Depression came surging in. I didn't care about myself

In the past I isolated myself and withdrew from a lot of people. But there were some that never gave up on me. If this person so far away seemed to care

So I called for help. Transportation to the nearest hospital was only a few minutes away. Vomiting

My phone had a skype app and when I logged in

Then the sadness and crying came back.

They transported me to a mental hospital for suicide watch. They let me go a few days later after I convinced the psychiatrist that my actions were selfish. Ending my pain could not justify the effects on those who still cared about me. 

When I was released I tried skype again. she was offline. offline all the times that I checked 2 -3 weeks so I knew she blocked me. 

A few days ago she sent me a pm on reddit asking if I wanted to chat again. A few hours later we were on skype. I was going to tell her about her role in my (hopefully) recovery. But when I asked her why she wanted to chat again

For two days we had intermittent contact. Small talk really. Then I was ready to dive in. I got her attention and then dropped the subject because I didn't have the words for what I felt. We continued small talk until a few hours ago. 

I fucked up. My suicide attempt obviously messed shit up and probably traumatized her. A few hours ago she said that she wouldn't talk to me anymore she found someone else to help her. To cut things short. I mentioned our friendship. She basically stated that we were never friends. It hit me like a sledgehammer. I basically laid it out, because I dropped too many bombs on her already. I reminded her that I wasn't well, I think because I wanted her to know I wasn't rational when I did what I did. A hail Mary pass. But before I threw the ball down field, I realized what I was doing. I'm still sick. She never knew the real me. So if she didn't know me then, how could I be her friend? 

So I summed up her point of view and added some of mine regarding our ""friendship"" and continued to say that if she didn't want to talk to me anymore then I would find no need to continue future conversations. 8 minute later the word appeared on the screen ""Okay"". The last thing she said to me. But I couldn't let her believe that I never thought of her as a friend in the short time we communicated. I let her know what made me think we were friends and my admiration for her as a human being. Then following her wishes

",6,44,http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/ui35i/do_i_deserve_death_long_not_for_the_faint_of_heart/,"Suicide has been on my mind a lot lately. For years, I've been having some pretty intense visions of my suicide, but not frequently. These past few weeks, I haven't gone to sleep without seeing them.

Why? Because I am a rapist.

Yeah. Just gonna let that one hang out there.

How'd it happen

When I was 5 or so, etc. Nothing major, kinda pushed it into the dark and didn't think about it ever again. 

When I was 9, molest me. My parents knew about the physical stuff. I doubt they knew the many times my older brother nearly raped me. They sent him away to live with my mother while my father kept my self and siblings.

The damage was done, when I buried it in the dark and stopped thinking about it.

When I was 15, I searched for porn. I didn't like seeing the old models, so I looked for younger. And the Internet provided. Did I mention that I struggle with pedophilia? I'm mostly over it now, but it was tough when I was 17-18. That's when the hallucinations of my death first started.

When I was 16, with a boyfriend. He was the creep in the class with a massive jealousy complex. He would become controlling of her if any other man would try to even talk to his girl. I thought it was pathetic, but harmless. Until she told me she had been raped. 

I have never felt such rage until that point. I wanted him dead

I wanted to do something

When I was 18, so I went off to college while she stayed to finish high school. We'd be together forever! It was going to be perfect. That's what I thought until the 8 hour drive to my college became a reality. I should have known that was going to break us, but it took me 3 semesters before I dropped out to be back with her to salvage what was left. 

She graduated high school and we moved in together. This, I kept thinking. But we both worked different shifts. We never got to see each other and were too exhausted to really live our lives. 

Almost three years to the day of when we started dating

She slept with a friend a few days after that. I broke. I literally broke. I became angry, hateful. She still thought of me as a best friend, so one night, we were cuddling and I forced myself on her. ""She was supposed to be mine"" I thought, so I took what I thought I deserved. 

That is the last memory I have for a week and a half. 

The next memory I had was of my father trying to knock my apartment door off its hinges with the cops trailing behind him. Apparently that morning

She wasn't too far off

My father took me back to his place to keep me under suicide watch for two months. My ex went to the police

I worked and she dropped the charges.

I got a better job, but it did get serious. 

The problem? The two women I got close to were victims of abuse. 

The first had been molested by her older brother for years. Her and I had dated for a week in high school

She had essentially thrown her life away

She didn't like the man she was living with, even through everything. One day, she needed to get away from the fighting between her and her boyfriend. So she came to me. She became my best friend for a while, and we helped each other heal some. 

She ended up moving away from my friendship when her boyfriend found out that she and I were sleeping together. Oops. She stopped talking to me after she went back to her boyfriend

Another friend was a girl who had been four grades behind me. I met her first before I met many of my other close friends. After years of sporadic contact, so we would hang out and just have fun. She would gracefully ignore my advances enough so I stopped. She saw me as a brother. Someone she could trust. 

One night, but it helped me realize just the extent of abuse I had suffered. 

She is currently my closest friend and will likely be taking me to the community mental heath center in my town. Assuming I survive that long.

The last had been another girl I had dated once in high school. She turned lesbian after she dumped me

She got in contact with me a month and a half ago and we became good friends again. She's a bit of a nympho and she took me into her bed. I enjoyed it and so did she. One night

I was shocked

Ever since that

No one seems to notice

But every night as I lay down to go to sleep

So

I have also tried a number of types of therapies with 4 different therapists
As a last resort I tried ECT, but because of memory loss I can't say for sure. I had to stop school during this period and eventually quit going to ECT as, besides making me loose the memory for the previous year and a half, it made me loose all memory in between each session, so I could not realistically finish school or hold a job while undergoing ECT.
Needless to say I've tried everything I can think of and as the title says I am out of ideas.
I'm a Pharmacist and am pretty good at searching the medical literature. By doing this I have heard about ketamine but the very short duration of action makes it seem like its worthless. The only other thing I could find that has ever been reported to work in people who have failed ECT is using opiates for depression

She loved to help people. Talking with all her friends now

I want to say that the anti-depressants caused the death of my little sister but I know there is more to that. I discovered through chat conversations that she had been depressed for quite some time. But we never knew. She had a previous case of depression when she was 14 but things got better and better for her. She was more physically active, if only she told us, if only she showed us some signs of depression we could have been able to help her.  She didn't.  I believe it was because she didn't want to burden us, didn't want to let us down, didn't want to be monitored and treated differently.  But without us knowing, we were never able to help.  Every day was a normal day, for us.  If you have depression, they will help if you seek it out.  If you really can't talk to anyone, public speaking classes and she seemed much better during this time.  It was when it all stopped during the holidays.

Before we get to the fun stuff - a few reminders. 

**Reminder One** 

We are **not** a hotline and cannot guarentee an answer to every post or a timely response. Sometimes it gets quiet here

**Reminder Two** 

Moving discussions to pm is not something we recommend for multiple reasons. We have a lot of lurkers here that read what others post and are helped by replies to things they haven't posted. In addition, and takes the pressure off of people trying to help. *Even the professionals at suicide hotlines do not handle phone calls by themselves. They always have someone there to support them and offer input.* 

**Reminder Three** 

Please read the sidebar before you post. It has all sorts of cool stuff in it

**CHANGES WE ARE CURRENTLY CONSIDERING**

Right now we are talking about how we can improve the subreddit and take advantage of some of reddit’s cool features. We would love to know what you think/if you have any ideas about how we can do this. 

1. Flair. We're talking about it. What kind of flair would *you* find helpful? What would be unhelpful? Do we need flair at all? 

2. Self-posts only. We're considering turning the community into a self-post only subreddit. Links would still be allowed - BUT they would have to be in a self post with text accompanying them that explains the link. Things like 'Click here' wouldn't count


3. As you may know

**THINGS WE HAVE DISCUSSED AND WILL NOT BE DOING**

These are less fun

The downvote button stays - we can't actually remove it, we will revisit this. 

We will not be setting up an IRC channel, or anything of the sort. We've got our hands full here, and don't have the ability or the time to moderate them properly. Any such thing that shows up is going to have no moderation or an entirely different mod team - please keep that in mind if you find one and decide to visit it. 


**YOUR TURN!**

Now that all of the serious stuff is out of the way - what do you want to see in this community? Is there a change that you think would be good to make? Do you have a suggestion? Now is a great time to let us know!

And there I am, unable to move, unable to look away, forced to watch him die. listening to him beg me for help. See his eyes, his crystal blue eyes, close never to open again. fuck, most of them broken several places. some internal damage, but he couldnt forget. They tried to help me in the rehabiliation time

Im done fooling myself that life is worth living. Im done trying to hang on for the sake of hanging on. Life holds nothing for me but pain and suffering. an endless and viscious circle that has left me a shattered and destroyed useless human being with no other desire than for everything to be done. Come new years eve Ill hang myself and finally do what everyone else has hoped I would do for several years.

Edit: I have no idea why I made this post, what do I have to lose, less than 2 weeks to live anyways. This whole experience is troubling.

The cops showed up at work the next day and *tried to suggest evidence of a sexual relationship between me and the girl*. (The girl was sixteen at the time, now seventeen. I'm fifty.)

I have lost friends at work over this

Today, and I have no one to confide in.

When I escaped home at 17 and went to the city I got a job and got on with my life. When I turned of age, mostly fraud. Ended up stealing over a million, but they could only prove a little bit and did a year in jail. Got out of jail with the addiction , met a girl got married, had a kid , and still couldn't beat the addiction. She ended up leaving me, I started frauding again and have warrants for my arrest. I also discovered at 34 years old I am a gay male. I tried so hard to keep it in the closet and hoped those feelings went away. All my so called friends would flip out. I really havn't come out to anyone, I can't pay the rent

My relationships with people are so destructive, and everyone that was at one point has proven that and has left. 

My parents are out of the picture. They never cared, talked down to, etc. They never supported in anything. 

So reddit, all the over dramatic reactions to stupid situations, everything. I've come to accept this - and I'm ok with it. There's noone there to help - and there's no one there that cares. I know people always say ""Think about the people you're leaving behind""... but truth is there is literally nobody. When I say this, I mean LITERALLY NOBODY. Nobody want's anything to do with me, and new people who meet me come to realize that as well.

**I have suffered from depression for years**. I have been depressed for as far as I remember, I didn't feel happier. I have also gone to therapy twice, but have felt it wildly ineffective, as I was 12 the first time I went, and the second time was earlier this year. I had just found a job and was quite excited about it, but more on that later.

**I can't forget anything**. I think of myself as a pretty nice guy, I can't remember any of the positive stuff that's happened to me, only the negative. I've also done some really bad shit in my life, in the name of puberty, that I'd like to forget, but can't. 

If you want to be objective, I made out with my sister. In 2004, I molested my step-sister, though I doubt she remembers, as I haven't seen her since. Before you call the police, I was 14 at the time and would have fucked a table leg if I could have, and she was 11 or 12. Around 2002-2004 I also downloaded and watched and pleasured myself to child pornography

I'm sure several people would want me to kill myself (or want to kill me themselves) based on this alone. I make no excuses today for any of these things happening

**I really, but the damage has already been done. It's turned me into a cynical douchebag with no patience and anger issues.

**My life has no direction**. After high school I went to college for a year and a half before I dropped out/got kicked out. I didn't really care about any of my classes

**I am pretty much unemployable**. I've been fired from every job I've ever had. In my entire working life I've probably only made $4000. I worked at a juice place in 2006 and was fired after a month for screwing up. In March

**I suck at being social**. If I could afford to do so, hell, I've never even been on a date. The only recurring social situation I face is playing Rock Band once a week at someone's house, which is the same thing we've done almost every week for two and a half years.

**I feel like nobody loves or respects me**. When I had the opportunity to do so, yet they haven't tried to return it or trade it in. Another person sold off the more expensive of the two games I gave him two weeks after he got it. Both these people have revenue streams and can easily afford something in return. I am fully aware that this sounds really petty and that people have other shit going on, but at the end of the day I am left feeling nothing but taken advantage of.

The only thing I do with my family anymore is argue over the stupidest

**I have made several plans to kill myself**. I have a feeling this is the biggest risk factor. Not really any need to get into specifics unless someone wants to.

If you've made it this far

I know there's a lot of shit outlined that I have to deal with (it took me fifty minutes to write this post), unemployed and depressed and unable to deal with the terrible act of existence.

I am 26 years old and have been looking for a job one and off since I was 19. I started going to college at 19 and that has been my primary focus. I was the first in my family to graduate from high school and only. So my Dad told me to focus on education and he would take care of the rest. I still tried to get a part time job in the mean time. I have had very few interviews and since going to school full time, yet again I am met with even more rejection. I tell myself constantly not to give up that my time will come.  I finish up college at 25 and I prepare myself for the job hunt. This time I have an open schedule, I have a bachelor’s degree, that should show I wasn’t being lazy right? I was going to school I did something to occupy my time. After having 12 or so interviews since December, I am starting to hate myself more and more. Every time I put in an application I get this feeling of dread. I go to check on my applications and that doesn’t help, neither does not checking on my applications. I research interview questions, I always dress presentable. With each failure at finding a job I find myself wanting to just end it all. I don’t want to be a leach on society.

But I'm just so tired. 
I've contemplated it so many times and i'm slowly being pushed further and further to the brink.

Ultimately
I have a little sister, and friends who i care about too much to leave.

But I don't know what else to do.
I'm just so tired.
I don't know where to go anymore in life.
I'm graduating and I'll be headed to prom soon

I feel like I don't deserve to live here

Every day I contemplate suicide. I have all of the materials ready whenever I choose to use them. I plan my steps out, what I will write as a note. I want this so badly it hurts but I care too much about some people and it's preventing me from ending my stupid life.

I don't know what's wrong with me

I guess one question i have is

Another question I have is: what is wrong with me? I know my dad's decided to leave our family behind to live with his mom and sister's family instead. I know that my mother's a pretty emotionally abusive person

My issue is that my life, and yet that doesn't stop me from wanting to die. Why? Am I just selfish?

EDIT: Wow! I really didn't expect all of these answers! thank you so much

""I know you're upset and you have a lot going on with you right now. Have some of my candy and don't be sad!"" 

I mean

I'm still in a really awful place at the moment. I had a moment of weakness and self-harmed and purged my lunch, but spending time with my sister and my cat definitely helps me ignore these feelings. 

So I guess for now, but I know that as long as I have someone to care about, and as long as I think people might at least care a little about me, then I'll live. 

I'm scared of the day where I just stop caring about the people around me and go for it though. It's going to happen one day, I still have this tired, empty feeling and it's killing me. I want to die so badly, but at least I know that for now, I'll suppress these urges.

I spent about a week there

Spent the night at my cousin's house who coincidentally lived in the same city in which I was hospitalized. Had plans to take the train back to a town right outside my college's town the next morning, so my cousin dropped me off on her way to work, but between being sick and anxious about being ""that passenger"" I kind of forgot to breathe; when I found out the train was delayed for like 12 hours and I'd basically be stuck in the station being sick all day I had the most debilitating panic attack ever. Oxygen had kind of stopped going to my arms and legs and they just became paralyzed, numb, and tingly. I felt it in my nose, too, and my vision started to cloud up. I seriously thought I was going to die. Never had anything like that happened to me before so I just screamed for help until someone realized there was an actual problem here.

Obviously

Anyway. Why I called them: 
I've been living in a new city (ie. not my hometown) for a few years now. I became involved with various communities (I'm sorry for keeping this vague, I've been told that I become very clinical when talking about my emotions, like I'm trying to divorce myself from them. Me typing this sort of proves that, I suppose.) 

I would be invited to things, but I'M SCARED OF PEOPLE."" It really doesn't make any sense to anyone but those who have social anxiety as well. So my anxiety has gotten worse and worse over the years, and that caused depression because I'm not able to interact with people in what I feel is a normal, proper way. I've been on anti-anxiety medication for about 2 years now, but it doesn't seem to help much anymore. At least, until I go off them completely (as I have in the past) and start having real panic attacks. Then I go back on them. A fun cycle! 

So recently I had an interview with an agency that wants to represent me in the entertainment industry. I completely fucked up and showed up 20 minutes late, etc. They were very mad at me. They said they're reconsidering taking me on. Oh, and the more I talk with them the less I think I want to be there. They're asking for money that I simply don't have. I'm dirt-poor, working 2 part time jobs and living in a house with people that I don't know, although I guess they seem very nice. They just aren't for me. 

So I walked out of the meeting feeling like shit. This is it. I don't want to sign with them

Look, but can't figure out how or muster the energy to. I hate talking about this. I hate talking to my friends, because sooner or later I wind up talking about this. And I hate that. I hate how weak I am, and I hate myself. I wish I was happy, but I can't figure out how to do it. 

Even when good things happen to me, but to be honest I just don't give a fuck. I don't know if I'm suicidal, I guess I am if I called the hotline and bothered to type out this huge fucking thing. I guess I have been since high school. I didn't even realize how depressed I was at the time, until recently when I've talked to people who knew me in high school. Anyway, I had this plan that by the time I was 32, if I couldn't look back on my life and think of a sustained period of feeling happy, then I was perfectly within my right to kill myself. I'd tried, I'm still a ways off from 32

Personally, but a tickling of the ribs. It makes me laugh. **My depression** makes me laugh. Don't confuse that with your depression. I own my depression, and I'm proud to acknowledge it. Why? Because I've passed it. I've reached over to my depression, gave it a hard look, and laughed at it. As if it meant held little power. And it does hold little power. So when you talk about depression, don't forgo the thought of discussion your own. Because it's part of you. It's made you stronger. When you know extreme sadness, then happiness is bliss. And when you know bliss

So. Feel proud of your depression. Feel proud that you've conquered something to massive and internal. Feel proud to tell others that you suffered through it. And even if they don't understand in the same way that us SuicideWatchers do

So yeah

I mean, by being afraid of their greatest gift to me...offering me themselves.

They never offer again. The fear of sex claims another victim. And so it spreads...

I watch the ones I love torture themselves for offering me love. 

So

No

I mean

And just because I'm so terrified of sex that even thinking an impure thought about the word ""orgasm"" is enough to trigger a reaction more appropriate for a returning soldier...

And all my friends with a sex phobia cured theirs by being women who wanted sex bad enough not to say ""no"" when people begged them for it. They're in loving relationships right now

Know the worst part of all this? Not the literal worst part. More an ironic final note on it. 

I sound like an MRA and a forever alone. 

And I have no way to end this

I'm sick of defending myself. I'm sick of being forced to jump through hoops over and over again just to prove I'm in pain far and above what most people will ever experience...and others experience every day. 

And I'm sick of at the end of it all

So, and I am enough of a host to spare you a novel's worth of answers I've already been given that just didn't work...

Ten years later I can still close my eyes and call this moment in vivid detail to mind. I was irrevocably changed that day.

He was 40 years old. His daughters were 18 and 15, even though he never seemed to want something in return. He left behind two parents, who absorbed the situation with the same quiet stoicism that has guided them through the many other traumas that life has left at their doorstep. He left behind countless customers, friends, acquaintances, employees, cousins

He was a rock in our family, I would have given him anything in my power. He never asked. He found himself lost with literally hundreds of people around him who would have happily helped guide him home, or more accurately do whatever was in their power to help keep him safe and happy until he could find his own way home. 

Ten years later so much has changed. One of his daughters is married, but I know my uncle would have been proud of the women they've become. The home he built with his own two hands has become a living shrine to his memory. A place we all gather for events we wish he could be here to see; birthdays, meals, laughter, pain, and just moments of every day life. He would have been fifty earlier this year. We threw him a birthday party just because none of us wanted to sit at home and think about the celebration that should have been. So instead we got together and celebrated what was. 

I cannot judge him for the decision he made. I wish I had the chance to talk him out of it and I really think he missed a lot of joy these past ten years, please do it for the person you are going to leave behind who would give anything to have been there for you that night.

I am a 26 year old male

I have always been very unhappy with who I am, their toxicity is just too low. They remain a common method of attempt, however, due to their availability and because of tradition, and I had not yet studied much medicine back then.) Ever since, I have wished for my life to end, and for many years now my going to bed ritual involves praying that I will not wake up.

So how does it work treating others for mental disorders and suicidal behavior when you're ill yourself? The answer is not well. I will look at my patient as she describes her symptoms, please stop complaining."" After every patient visit I will lock myself into one of the bathrooms and run my hands under cold water, telling myself ""you will make it through the rest of this day."" I will suggest different treatment regimes based on what symptoms my patients present and what medications they have tried, and I will assure them ""I know it is hard now, but as soon as we have chiseled out the optimal therapy you won't have to suffer these suicidal thoughts anymore."" While in reality I just want to say ""how can your suicidal thoughts torture you so? I consider them a comfort, a reassurance that I won't have to continue living."" When I meet patients with cancer and other terminal diseases, I find myself envying them, magically absorbing their illness so that they can be well

I realize how this sounds, and I have helped many, as evidenced by gifts I've received from content patients.

So, I have managed to work for about a year, and thus I think I have earned not having to continue on. I will spend time with my mother and my brother, and try to express to them how much I love them so that they will not think it is their fault when they find out later. Since I am a no-lifer I have not spent any of the money I earned, so I will transfer it all to them. I understand it does not in any way compensate for their loss, but it will perhaps help and show them that I do not blame them, and love them.

Thank you for listening

I am completely lifeless now. I don't know what to think. I can't cope with that fact. I can't face the fact my friend will be burried in the ground. What should I do

**EDIT**: Me and his closest friends have arranged a meeting tonight, always ask people if they have problems, he definitely had them, but was too hermetic to talk about it, and this is how he ended up. His family is totally devastated. He was 21, and was a brilliant medical student with straight A's, and I still have no idea what has been bothering him. My day is filled with ""what if..."" moments, but the fact that stays is that he's dead.

**ANOTHER UPDATE**: Hey guys, and advice, I really needed it, I felt alone at the time, but now seeing so much people helping me at this hard time is a real blessing. You all deserve a gigantic hug.

I'm 28, hopeless, and sad. So I've had to live with that for 15+ years now. It's gotten so bad at times that I've thought about killing myself:

- 2010
- 2011, pain, and anxiety, now I also had to deal with my every other thought fueling this mental obsession.
- 2012

It's now mid-2013. My life is a parody of what it was in the past, anger, pain, sadness, hatred, self-loathing, fear, panic attacks, anhedonia

I've done therapy, meditation, and so on. I have some good friends and a strong relationship with my family. But my patience is just about done.

Contrary to what you hear, feel, or think about anything else besides putting an end to this hell. Nothing has changed.

My life is like a nightmare that I can never wake up from. I have one last hope, then I will probably make the idiotic and shortsighted decision to kill myself.

I am a coward and I am lazy, but 100 years from now this will all be forgotten.

It will be excruciatingly painful for my mom and she will probably go insane -- how could I do that to her? I don't know. I guess not only am I a coward and lazy

Everything hurts.

1364711562.0,1bciys,It gets better. This is my story.,wasabishooter,50,12,9,"To everybody who has ever had a suicidal thought. I ask you to read my story. I too contemplated suicide when I was younger. I am still here 8 years later. I hope what I am about to write serves as support for those who need it.

I had just started middle school. I never really had many friends, and end my life for me. I never felt more useless in my life. The only thing that kept me going was my love for my family and how distraught they would be if I was gone. They were the only ones who had ever loved me. 

Each day it got worse and worse, began to fail my classes, and began to lash out at my parents. I told them I did not want to live anymore if people only viewed me as a target. My mom simply told me one thing: Pretend like nothing happened.

I had no idea what to think of what she said. How could I pretend to hide my pain? But as I soon realized what she meant, I didn't say a word. I spent my entire seventh grade year without uttering another word. Everybody thought I was a freak. Nobody bothered to mess with me anymore because I no longer showed any reactions to the pain. 

8th grade came along, picked on me, but again I never said a word, talking to only parents upon arrival home. I became part of their group, and it was the most fun I've ever had; playing football on the grassy field, not saying a word to anybody. I knew I was an outcast. But in high school that was all about to change, when I met my friend Don (name changed for privacy). 

Don was very similar to me. He was a male, and him to me. As I learned about his story I realized I was not the only one in agony; I wasn't the only one who wanted to end my life. I saw the marks on his wrist, he was a cutter. I asked him how many times he's attempted suicide, and he said he has tried to die at least 5 times, but was never successful. Everyday I looked forward to seeing Don, hoping that he would show up at school. He did not show up one day, and I assumed one of his attempts was finally successful. He attended school the next day and told me that the only reason he isn't dead is because I had given him hope that he was more than just a victim of bullying. I had become his first friend, he said he wouldn't go if I didn't go with him. I told Don that seeing him alive gave me a new meaning in life

I had read this, but pretty popular guys who were involved in the school elections and events. Don followed me along, and although he didn't speak a word to anybody else but me, he is still alive today. On graduation day, he thanked me for being there for him everyday, and introducing him to the new friends. He eventually began to talk to them and he fit right in. 

What I am trying to say here is: Don't assume that you aren't worth living. Everybody was put on this world to live, you aren't trying hard enough. I don't know where Don and I would be today if it weren't for our meeting each other, but I know that talking to each other gave us a new-found meaning of life. If you honestly feel like there is no one out there for you, I'd like to start off by saying: I'm here. Even though I am on the Internet and you don't know who I am, I am here.  Try to initiate conversation with people. Don't expect them to talk to you first. You never know where you will meet your Don, but he or she is out there. Trust me. 

Also, I think back to those who respected me and cared for me. Don, my parents, my family, and past lovers. If you've had a past lover, then obviously you have the capability to be loved. And although the person you love may have different feelings about you, it doesn't mean that your life has to be over because of it. Someday

So I ask you all a favor: Please, but there are no regrets and the happy times we had together, will eventually make their way to me again."" 

Hope that my story has been a helpful one


Edit: Don and I have not really kept in touch since we both moved on to college

Well where to begin?  The big catalysts were breaking up with my girlfriend of 3 years and being laid off from my job within two months.

I spiraled pretty quickly out of control.  I bought crystal meth from a friend and started doing it almost every day as I survived on unemployment checks.  I got little jobs here and there as I was a web designer

I went to all night coffee shops and wrote and obsessed about my ex.  I was brutally and hopelessly depressed.

I drank.  I started smoking.  This is coming from a guy who was the picture of health.  I used to run, she thought I looked like a skeleton.

I started going to therapy.  After crystal meth though I did get hooked on pain pills I stole from my roommate at the time.  But eventually those ran out and I had no choice but to become somewhat sober.

My therapist meant well but I lied to her

What set me off next was seeing my ex after a few years.  Seeing the house that she bought.  The house she was living in with her new boyfriend.  Seeing how happy she was and what the fuck was I doing?  

I got pain pills

I got into a car accident going to work while I was high on valium.  Nobody was hurt so the cops weren't called.  There were to be no drug tests.

I started hanging out with a guy who partied a lot.  We'd go out to clubs and do a lot of drugs and try to meet women.  I shudder to think how I looked to those women

The main thing I can say about how it all lead to a suicide attempt was it felt like a snowball rolling down a hill.  I knew what was happening but there was nothing I could do to stop it.  It was going to end

On a Saturday

I called my friend and left a message on his voicemail.  ""Do you ever think of death?""

I grabbed a belt from my closet but couldn't find anything to hang from myself from.  So I drank some more.  I was so completely out of it

When I woke up the next day

I called my therapist and told her what happened.  She wasn't pleased.  She told me to call a friend over otherwise she was calling 911.  She also told me she couldn't be my therapist any more.  That she couldn't handle me.  At the time

But embarrassment overrode everything and I called a friend lest I be hauled out of my apartment by EMT in front of my neighbors.  My friend came over

She cried when she was the cuts on my arm.  And all of a sudden I was comforting her.

I don't know what advice I can give about coming this revelation yourself.  Maybe you need to get that close to the edge before realizing you don't want to go over.  And some people make it and some don't.

I think about killing myself every now and then, that's all we know we have.

If you're out there, only you can figure out a reason to live.  But it only takes one reason.  One spark to keep going.  And if you make it one more day, hour or minute, that's something.  Don't think about the rest of your life.  Think about this moment.

1288374729.0,dycs0,A funeral director's thoughts and observations on suicide -- Please Read before you do anything,throwaway432122,51,12,65,"I have been involved with suicide both professionally and personally and I hope if I share some observations with you can find the courage to get help. 

Do not underestimate the impact your death will have on people. Your friends and family will spend pretty much the better part of their lives wondering why they never saw the signs and what they could of done to stop it. The ""What if"" game many suicide survivors (the term used to describe the loved ones of people who end their lives) will spend the better part of their lives on will be extreme torture. You would not want your mother tortured to death so why put her through similar agony. 

Suicides has a huge impact on first responders. It is them who have to deal with the families at the scene and have to deal with the human remains. Even people walking by the scene to see loved ones crying in the front drive can be adversely affected. 

Forget what you have seen about death on tv. Suicide involves an act of trauma inflicted upon the body to cause death. These traumatic acts (falls

Whoever finds you will probably have a lot of mental problems to deal with as a result of this. Of course

I have seen all sorts of suicides under a variety of conditions and I am convinced there is no nice or easy way to end one's life. The internet is full of information on how to do it and quite frankly its all garbage. Medical doctors get things wrong all the time and medical science is always learning new stuff. Do not trust people who have no medical training (because if they did they would legally and ethically obligated to not give advice on suicide) on something that medical science itself knows very little about. They are all alive. How can they know what a good suicide method is?

Do not underestimate the body's ability to survive trauma. People jump off tall bridges and survive only to drown in the water or live for 15 minutes before dying. 26 people have survived jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge and a study was done in which they were asked

Funerals for suicide victims are always very awkward affairs. Death notices describe people ""who pass away suddenly in their home"" and nobody dare speak about the cause of death. Family members often feel guilty and will spend large sums of money on the funeral in the hopes it will atone for not stopping the suicide. 

A full service funeral with a burial and a monument could easily cost your family $15000. Do you really want to stick your family with a large bill. If you think its expensive to live you should see how much it can cost to die. 

I have been there myself. I can tell you I have stood on the edge myself but always managed to pull myself back. Even knowing what I do about the subject I have still gone through it. I can tell you one of the lonliest and scariest things I ever did was walk into a hospital emergency room and ask for help but I am glad I did. 

As scary and lonely as it was

I haven't spent much time in this subreddit (first post here)

While in many ways I'm the same person with the same problems, and I pretty consistently manage to look forward to the future now.  I don't have any illusions about making some huge difference by posting anonymously to the internet, but if I can be a small part of what helps a couple people get to the same place from where I used to be, it's one of the better ways I can imagine investing my time.

-------

First off, and you fear it isn't just simple matter of 'adjusting your perspective'... and in all brutal honesty, I'm gonna hafta tell ya you're probably right about that.  The trick is how you transform the pull of oblivion from a howling supermassive black hole of overwhelming madness to something you can put in a room in your mind and shut the door on for a while.  You'll start to find with time that a whole lot of human beings have such rooms.  Dealing with that isn't easy, you damn well know it isn't-- but from my experience, it absolutely does get easi*er*.

-------

NOTE:  When you're bad enough off to seriously consider ceasing your existence, are:
1. complete assholes (intentional or not)
2. totally clueless
3. not worth your time

Please keep this in mind at all times.  Thank you.

-------

Okay, ugly thing, and you can't flip a switch to change that.  With certain drugs, you may be able to slightly alter the picture, but really your only escape is sleep or passing out.  Am I making sense so far?  So, sleeping longer - or forever - starts to look like the most beautiful thing in the world (especially if you have insomnia).  And then the planning starts.

You tell someone about it, and even though you know they're full of shit, there's a part of your mind that follows the thread along anyway...  *maybe I am just being weak/selfish/dense/whatever, I need to 'buck up', but ohmygodicannotdoit, WTFiswrongwithme, i'm badwrong for being this way, ireallydonotbelonghere

You don't have to justify or validate your feelings to anyone-- they simply exist, and find the right tools that work for you.  The sharp edges get worn down &amp; rounded out, and become blunted.  More beauty, wonder - and yes, even love - do await you, and it is worth it to try to make it through all this.  Still, you have to survive in the mean time.  Why?  Hang with me

I'm not gonna sugar coat this next part.  Whatever thing or combination of things that has brought you to this place quite likely won't ever stop hurting when you're reminded of it.  Hell, but let's not fool ourselves, it's pretty goddamn bad.  There are some other harsh things you're going to have to accept, too-- what pushed me over the edge all those years ago was a set of staggering realizations, all of which I was fairly sure were true (and they in fact turned out to be): 
1. my options for 'how to live' were becoming extremely limited 
2. certain future major disappointments &amp; failures were basically inevitable
3. I wouldn't just disappoint myself
4. much of my dysfunctionality was permanent for all practical purposes
5. I would never completely get over *her*
6. I wouldn't live up to my potential
7. my safe

There's more, but that's enough.  Stare it in the face.  It's too much to take, isn't it?  It was for me, truly.  I could not process all those facts and remain sane at that point... ...but I can now.  

Here's a thought-- be glad that you're one of the privileged few who have actually woken up from the zombified autopilot life!  People like us value other people like us a great deal.  It doesn't come up very often, nature and human kindness.  All you have to do is figure out how you can live with yourself and these realities first.

Yeah, do what it takes to maintain your existence a while longer anyway.  It's a mess, but you might not have to clean it all up... and if you do, there ought to be an end point worth getting to, or failing that, at least some damn fun escapes now and then.  

Learn that within you is both a child and a parent

-------

**Finally, but for most of you, there is probably some person or animal you can think of that you would never want to harm... and if you check out completely, it will almost certainly cause someone just like that to suffer in a way that you would *not* want to be the cause of.  A being who doesn't deserve it will surely *hurt deeply* if you do this, possibly far worse than you can imagine.  If not directly, than indirectly through empathy when they find you or learn of your story, or through the absence of something positive you would've done if you'd been here.  

The premature end of a human life, you probably don't.  Regardless, there is no glory in it-- only more senseless loss, permanent wounds and forever unanswered questions.  

This is what you do: you *just keep on* walking, however half-heartedly, no-heartedly or half-assedly, but you don't stop breathing...  for the sake of other people more than for your own interests.  Even a heavily medicated semi-life can help facilitate the experience of things like joy and love beyond itself, and I believe it's worth it to keep going for that reason alone.  Just fucking do it.  And who knows?  Maybe - just maybe - after a long while, you'll occasionally find yourself having a sincerely good time.  In those moments, it will be worth whatever it took.  I promise you, you *will* be glad you made the effort in the long run.

I am at a crossroads, even though my state will keep paying for school after I used my gi bill so when I heard my mom mention vocational school as a possible route

The thing is, I make a decent amount of money for a college student, (3900/month) it's pretty much everything I dreamed of. I never wanted to leave college with a lot of debt. Except I have no social life, no friends, and girls think I am some creeper because I show up to school sweaty sometimes because I ride my bicycle to school. It's sad, because this wasn't a problem for me a few years ago. I've tried asking out some girls in my classes, but they just kind of brush me aside and hook up with some jock. Not that I should really care, he's 41)

So last night I started having thoughts. I'm not sure about whether or not they are considered intrusive. Thoughts about packing up everything I own into boxes, (I'm O Negative, it would be selfish not to. At least I could ""live"" through someone else.) liquidating my assets and placing it in cash on the table to cover for funeral, clean up, rent for my roommate until he can find another place, then wrapping myself up in heavy duty plastic, placing a brick under my head to catch the bullet/bone fragments, so they can possibly be there in time to harvest my organs

The only thing stopping me is what it would do to my mother and my grandmother. My grandmother would literally die. Her heart couldn't take that, but I don't think it would ensure me getting killed on impact. I'd hate to live out another year in a vegetative state. 

I know I should probably give my bike rider friend my pistol for a little while. Especially after writing this. But I don't know what he would think of me. He is a really levelheaded person

(I wouldn't mind that) Or we can just post s4df=searching for depression friend on our own. OR!! You can just post your addies here! Let me know what you think would work!

EDIT 2: Also maybe we can team up with /r/depression

EDIT 3: So I think we should just try to work this into /r/suicidewatch and /r/depression and if there is a problem I'll make a subreddit. So I guess the terms we could use would be **s4lmc= searching for like minded companion**. We'll assume it's mostly online unless the person says otherwise. I'll try posting with this in a minute and I guess we'll see how it goes! All of you please feel free to pm me as well.

I don't know how much I'll be able to type out, and I've posted on reddit about it under my real account, which is why I cannot give too much info about it here.

It was (I feel fucking strange saying was instead of ""is""), and knows that I wouldn't do anything ever to hurt him.

About 1 hour ago

He set me in front of the door, but he was cleaning the house. I asked him multiple times if I could help him, but he declined. I was then finally determined to go to the supermarket, to buy some stuff for tonight (we had dinner plans). I was looking for him to clarify some things, when I walked outside, thinking he was there. As I walked inside, I got some mud on the floor. He came in, and that I'd help him clean up. I was trying to find a mop or something, and imitated me ""Wewewe can I help you?""

I thought the best thing would be to let him cool down, he had all of my things stuffed into two plastic bags. He told me to take everything, and to give him his clothes back (a few shirts of his are at my place). I looked at him in sheer shock and asked him what was happening, because I simply couldn't grasp how this situation had happened. He pointed a middle finger and told me to go fuck myself.

I have never heard anything like that from his mouth before. I've never thought he would say something like that.

Completely perplexed and baffeled I went to the front door

I got on my bike but I couldn't move I was standing in front of the house where my happiest hours had been spent.

I saw a glimpse of him in the window

Alone I went bicycling home

I feel like my soul has been crushed

I have no friends. Only him.

I don't know what to do

I feel like I want all of this to be over.

Please. Someone just talk to me. I have nobody else to turn to.

He thought it was because I loved him less. I never told him. He died thinking that. How do I forgive myself for that?

The mailman later informed me that the neighbor's son

Now, the mother too shaken to come out, and the poor son, who just couldn't keep going. All the time. It literally felt like someone I had known for years had died. I cried for them, lost sleep, and here, 500 miles away and years later, my heart feeling it each time. As uncomfortable as it is

Maybe you think no one would care if you weren't here anymore. Maybe you even live alone in a rural area and think no one would miss you. But believe me, well *I* care too.

He was a mentor to many kids, he would have found so many people reaching back to help him.”

I have been suicidal for a while. I made my husband [posted]( http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/1726ge/my_wife_is_suicidal_yesterday_was_her_second/) something he said while I was in the middle of a breakdown that really resounded with me. Now it’s my turn to share something.

It’s easy to forget the ones we love when we are in crisis. It’s easy to say things like, more than that, we would be inflicting a grievous injury on them that would never heal. They would think, “If only I had…” done any number of things. Picked up on signs, just stopped by that day, called, etc. For the rest of their lives they would carry around the guilt of having not done something. Now, not cared, and some of your actions have made me want to kill myself.” Don’t do it in a mean way. Be honest and tell them how you feel and how they have made you feel. I’m willing to bet they will change the way they act towards you and maybe even other people. 

I used to think that people would be sad for a little while, there are far worse things you can do that won’t end up with you dead or in jail (for the love of all that’s good in this world, just don’t kill anyone, especially yourself.)

I have “taken suicide off the table.” The grief and anguish that those people expressed, and I saw exactly how wasteful and tragic suicide is. The world was a better place with him in it. The world is a better place with me in it. The world is a better place with you in it.

Think of the people that you love

**Edit** For those who have no family or friends: The very fact that you are here tells me that you have looks at sidebar at least 53 other people you can reach out to. There are suicide hotlines, but it's true) and you will have a friend for life.

**Edit #2** I am not ""guilt shaming"" I am sharing my real experience from last night and the last few weeks in the hopes that it can help someone. I'm getting some serious negativity, you are in constant pain, and you have every right to take steps to end that pain, and anything, or anyone that tells you otherwise is a worthless (fill in with many very nasty expletives). I've been where you are, and I might be there again someday. The utter darkness that swallows your mind, the hatred for yourself and the world around you. ""Why does it keep hurting me? Why does the pain never stop? Why does every fucking thing that can possibly go wrong, what did I do to deserve this?""
  
  
I know where you are. I know that place very well. I wish I could take you out of it right now. I wish I could fly so I could swoop down and carry you to safety. Maybe I can't do it
   
*Don't let the pain swallow you. Fight that Goddamn son-of-a-bitch with all your might. Grab on to something, this is your life, YOU are the boss of your own life, not the pain, not the darkness, YOU. YOU are the boss. Don't like where you live? Move. Friends pissing you off? Tell them to fuck off. Get fired? Fuck em', they were a bunch of damn hell ass idiots anyway. Someone break up with you? To hell with them, and embrace the pain of it and ride it out to wherever it takes you. Someone you love die? Talk to them anyway. Carry them around in your heart and mind and let them live on through your thoughts and actions. Did all of this shit happen to you at once? Get out of bed every morning. Brush your teeth. Brush your hair. Wash your face.*  
  
I take one gut-wrenching step after another and wait for time to pass. And it will pass, then faster still. Brushing my teeth in the morning is getting easier, and everything is following. Today wasn't that bad. Tomorrow might be horrible. But things are going to get better. There will be setbacks, but I believe I will wake up in the light and leave the darkness behind me.

* I'm a 22 year old straight male from western Europe. No money problems. No girlfriend
* There are medical reasons for my suicide
* I've had concrete suicidal thoughts for at least three years. Pretty much permanently depressed for as long as I can remember.
* Yes
* Yes, I don't need any more.
* I realize I will leave people behind that will be hurt my by actions. Tough shit. There's a few people of which I *hope* what I'm going to do will fuck them up.
* My preferred method changed from drug cocktail to shooting to hanging. Shooting isn't an option because acquiring a gun here is ridiculously hard. Hanging is preferred to a drug cocktail, is prepared. Suitable length for my height and weight computed. It's at least as good as I can get it given the information I could find.

I'm sick and tired of people telling me crap like ""chemical imbalance"" and ""irrational decision"". Fuck you. Life consists of good things and bad things, go through a load of crap, and die. I want to skip the load of crap part.

A few months ago I signed up to do the ""Out of the Darkness Overnight"" which is a 20 mile walking fundraiser for the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention.  

**Anyway, I just need a little help.  I am asking for donations , large or small, every dollar makes a difference.  If 20 people donate $10, then I will reach my goal!**

I would like to let you know my story.  I read SW pretty much everyday

I have been seeing a therapist for over a year now, and I am still figuring out who I am, and from what I have realized, I really really like myself.  It's weird to say that.  Therapy has definitely helped me to notice things about myself that make me who I am, and are these really great qualities that you don't find in many people.  Things that I have always felt made me weak, or a pushover, or oversensitive, are really things that I should be proud of and embrace.  I am shy

For me, and panic attacks, and rage, and everything was out of control. My thoughts were so jumbled, and most of them were negative, self-demeaning thoughts.  Each thought had an emotion tied to it.  And I could think myself sick.  So toning everything down with Zoloft was a freakin godsend.

After that, and I really had to disagree with myself for a few months.  I wrote everything down, then rationalized it, and realized that the things I believed about myself weren't true.  This was so different from how it was before I started.

Then I started to try and work on my weight.  This is a big deal with me

I changed doctors, where you actually talk about your life and stuff.  It's not fun.  But she asks the right questions, and now since I don't have the overlying thoughts of failure, I can actually see what happened without all the negativity attached to it.  

**Anyway, and I want people to get help if they need it.**

Below is a link to my fundraising page:

[Fran Doerr's Fundraising Page](http://www.theovernight.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=extranet.personalpage&amp;confirmid=10013790)

If you can help, rather than bail myself out.  Either way, I'm going to walk, and can honestly say I did my best at fundraising.

1359840550.0,17rszp,Friends believes that his penis is 'destroyed' - an fear that is tearing his family apart. Does anybody have stories to share about BDD? (Body Dysmorphic Disorder),CaughtByTheStorm,44,6,7,"My friend/GF's brother (20M) has severe Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD). His form of the disorder is focused on his penis.
He has the (false) belief that his penis is 'destroyed'

The source of his anxiety is the idea that one day

Mainly, he has been in one serious relationship, and had only a few sexual encounters with the girl. During these encounters he never climaxed, which makes things worse.
The relationship fell apart about a year ago...mostly because he is a complete train wreck.

He mastrubates about 5-8 times a day - effectively, I mean that his penis becomes erect quickly, and that he is capable of climaxing. (It's basically a fear of erectile dysfunction).
Through this

I met him a few years ago and we became friends. While he was getting ill with the disorder
He shares with me, and so I don't hear the worst of it.

However
He wakes up every day, he calls his mom, and his mom tries to calm him down.

His mom often, and falling into despair. This is not as common, but about once every two or three weeks he will grab some knives from the kitchen and threaten to kill himself with them. 
Verbally

My GF and I, or ever to harm himself even moderately. (as is often the case for people with BDD, he is terrified of pimples and cuts). However, this may be just a really bad idea, and completely untrue...
In my eyes, but eventually - it all breaks apart. The mother allows him to bully her and treat her like shit. 

Yesterday, and he grabbed a pencil and held it to her throat - obviously threatening her with it.

He let go eventually, is shattered every single time he has one of his episodes. I know that he didn't hurt any one, but that he threatened the people he loves? I am scared and angry. I don't recognize this person.

If you have read this far into my story
I am so tired of him and his shit

Does anyone have ANY experiences they can share about BDD? Does anybody have any internet links they can share with me about this SPECIFIC kind of BDD?
His kind of BDD is very rare

If anyone can tell me anything

Thank you.

i guess a note would go to friends or loved ones but i have no one left

i want you to know that this decision to end my life is not a momentary irrational decision. i've tried to kill myself twice in the past 6 months

i am almost 30

my dreams and life ambitions were either lost or taken away from me. as a kid i dreamt of being a dancer or actress. i took dance classes throughout my childhood but eventually had to give them up when i grew large boobs which caused issues with dancing and gave me self image problems. at the end of highschool i revealed myself as bisexual to my parents

at 21 i found out that i was infertile and unable to carry child.i was devastated by the news, having children became another dream i had to abandon

 i had been in a lot of relationships, he didn't know until i told him at the end of the year at a new years eve party. we ended up dating for a year, he proposed and we were engaged for another year. we married. at this point our relationship was described by us and all our friends has a fairytale, everything seemed and felt so perfect. life could not get any worse.

but that was so wrong, we didn't speak.

matt expressed his desire to have children, but he seemingly moved on from it. we were still happy and in love with each other.

at the beginning of 2011 he confessed to me that he still had his desire for having a family with children, friends slowly abandoned me to continue being friends with him or because i wasnt fun to be around any more.

at the beginning of this year we finally divorced (it takes 12 months of separation before you can file in australia)


6 months ago i tried to commit twice. the first time i overdosed on my anti depressants that werent working at all and other medicines i could find around my house

when i was released i stopped eating and sleeping, not because i decided i wanted to live but because the method was stupid and that my next attempt should be well planned in advance. i had my housemate take me back to hospital and lied about the cut being from an accident.

as i had tried to od earlier in the week i was moved back into a psych ward

2 months ago and i begun planning this final attempt. while im okay with my death i know my few remaining friends would not be so i have slowly cut off ties and driven each one of them away. i have lied and pretended to be happy to almost everyone.

last month would of been our 4th wedding anniversary

they are happy, but i am left here alone, in hell for 2 years unable to sleep each night, left with dark thoughts and voices whenever im not distracting myself with video games or movies. no one cares for me, i don't care for them, i dont care for continuing.

today i will finish what i started. i will take my car

i wont be back to read any comments

Ever since I've been terrified of social situations. Just talking or being around people throws me into a panic attack. I usually spend most of my time alone in my room doing nothing. Whenever I have to talk to someone my mind just goes blank.. this even happens with what little friends I do have. There are people I know I should be good friends with
 
With the intense social anxiety you can imagine I'd have problems finding a girlfriend... It doesn't matter. I'm a pederast. Tried gay sex... didn't like it. Had sex with girls... didn't like it either. I never talk about sex or girls and I'm pretty sure everyone thinks I'm in the closet or something. It puts me in an awkward situation. I'd never hurt a kid

I'm not a stupid person... have a decent IQ, but because of my loans and financial aid I can't switch and I have to stick with it. This presents several problems. I can't handle social situations and if I want to make it in this industry or at least graduate I have to be good with people... something that I simply can't do. Also film is expression of yourself... but I don't want to show anybody what is really inside of me... they'll find out what a sick twisted fuck I am. 

I've tried to kill myself... I had a bad social interaction in my dorm and decided to swallow all my meds (150 pills)... I failed... I was put in a psych ward for a week and came back and got two year long pity party... yay.. I switched schools.

There was a very brief time where I felt good with my life.... I was going through a manic episode for a couple months... It was the first time in my life where I could talk to anybody without feeling like I was going to die. I found out what self esteem was like... my god I thought I had finally came out of my shell

Someone tell me why I should live? There is no magic pill out there that's going to make everything sunshine and rainbows. Therapy has never helped me. I admit some of my problems could be probably improved somewhat

TL;DR: I'm a socially inept pedophile with severe depression and anxiety that has lasted nearly half my life.

 I got a mortgage and bought her a house, the first year was great, i had great fun taking her everywhere i could think of, i showed her off as much as i could, i was so proud of my wife i wanted everyone to see and know her. 

We did have a problem in the first year that she fell pregnant, she chose to abort. 

 Something i'll live to regret till the day i die.

Later that year i caught her chatting online and planning to meet up with another guy when she travelled back to peru

My mother has been a big factor in the problems, i have had loads of arguements behind the scenes with my mum to leave her alone. She tells me what to do constantly also, she lives 20 mins away.

Over time i became obsessed with reforming the house, bbq, nice garden etc, doing it all myself. Consuming up all my time. I realise now that even though i alwayd asked her opinion on everything i put it in a way that she had to chose from my choises. I've always handled the money, she's not best at it and i'm quite good. We've never been rich but have saved up a little which we decided ti buy some land in peru to build on to sell.

the last years of the marriage we'd have lots of arguements, we worked together and i'm unfortunately a perfectionist.

Every majour arguement we had i'd promise to change what she was telling me she didn't like about me

my whole life has been dedicated to my wife

last year she went to peru and returned depressed, and the land we bought would be the doorway to financially allow us to move.

During the last year then i've worked hard to finish what i had started on our house here

she says i didn't intergrate with her family enough, also we had agreed to improve our lives and move back to peru so she went back for 2 months with every penny we had to build the house to sell, for me it was my single objective, getting the ball rolling to have the security and funds to go to peru.

She says that may be so but she needed me, not material things, not a fancy house which i've done up, she only wanted me, and to spend time with her parents, and religious wedding which she dreemed of even if only a simple one, she'd rather not built the house and used some of the money for me to spend xmas with her and her family

She has come back and after a day sat me down to say she no longer loves me

I know it's all my fault, she only wanted me, i don't understand why she didn't tell me directly. I'm obviously not good at reading signals.

I'm absolutely devastated, my sole reason for waking up was my wife.

I don't know what to  do???

In the night i wrote out a suicide note, guess 15 is unlucky for me, i have mixed emotions, i don't want to die, but i also don't to feel this pain. I know it's for atention, i would have killed myself by now if i had real intentions as the pain is so bad, but i'm lost

I'm very shy, whilst she was gone for 2 months i was so sad being alone, and now i'm going to be alone again becuase she's leaving me. I love her so much i can't bear it.

1257671545.0,a254w,All my joy has departed,IsThisTheWayOut,35,0,34,"I'm 43 yrs old.  A little over 3 years ago I was married, living in a very nice large comfortable house in a nice neighborhood. I was a soccer coach for my kids, I volunteered. I had hobbies. I helped family members with their problems. I had friends. I was living a good life

Today I don't want to show my face.   I'm divorced,12,14).  I haven't spoken to them in 10 months.  I live in my sister's basement.  I've not left the house in 14 days.  I haven't shaved in 3 weeks.  I haven't gotten a haircut in 3 months. I'm broke. I guess I'm maybe $30,000 in debt. (legal fees and credit cards).  I'm unemployed. I'm behind on my child support payments, and I think I'll never catch up. They took my driver's license because I haven't made payments. I hate my life. I escape by watching movies.   I am a bum.  A loser, in a very real sense.  But I also look exactly like you would think a loser would look. 

I can't sleep. I sleep about 3 hours a night on a good night. I weep every day. I can't work like this. I left my job because I was letting everyone down

I want to quit. I gave it a good shot, who are still my kids even though I haven't spoken to them in 10 months. 

How did I get here?  I still don't understand it.  My wife had an affair with my best friend, had dinner at each other's houses regularly. We spent a lot of time together. A little over 3 years ago, the secret came out.  I didn't want a divorce, I mean, we had four kids. I encouraged her to go to counseling with me, to reconcile. She was reluctant. Her family and my family encouraged her as well.  She went, but secretly continued to see him. 

She eventually walked out of counseling, alleged that I abused the kids. The courts believed her. She lied about my income. The courts believed her. Based on those lies, I was locked out of the house. My legal advice told me to rent a house, if I had any hope of getting shared custody.  I didn't have the money, because I was paying for the family house.  But I borrowed and rented a house anyway.  She stayed in the house, but refused to get a job. Eventually the bank foreclosed. 

Based on her accusations
In the end I lost all custody of the kids

I feel like I am permanently damaged.

I feel like I should talk to someone, but 3 hours before the appointment, I called to cancel it. I'm afraid now. I had been court-ordered into a DV offenders group - it was horrible enough to me that I am now afraid of any therapist or counselor.

Every week I'd walk in and I'd have to confess how I abused people that week.  At that time I wasn't seeing my kids, and the counselor would insist I was in denial, that I had in fact abused someone that week, and I wasn't admitting it.  The other guys would talk about how they picked fist fights with people, or swore at customer service people on the phone, or how they insulted perfect strangers waiting in line at the bank, or how they called their wives ""fat ugly bitch"" that week. I couldn't believe I was in that group.  None of those things were me. They'd tell stories about slapping their wives and threatening to kill them. I never did this. I felt so lost and out of place. So wrongly accused.  I never did those things and never had anything good to confess to

I went to another counselor

The whole frigging world is crazy. The people I had depended on have abandoned me.  First my ex-wife, and I'm not killing anybody.  But despite that I've still lost everything. 

----

When I go to church now

I feel like I am not made for this world. Or maybe I am

I know many people who lived like I lived. They have spouses and mortgages and yards and leaf-blowers. They go to baseball games and do homework with their kids.  They take family vacations, I didn't envy anyone. I felt extremely lucky.  But all that is gone for me, out of reach.  Even when the divorce was inevitable, I thought I'd get through it, we'd make separate lives, she'd get a job and we'd share custody.  I think at some point she decided she couldn't tolerate sharing custody.  So out came the allegations. 

They say suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem

----

I've never been suicidal.  When I was younger I didn't feel my problems were so serious.  I've never made a plan.  

But now I don't know how to ever get on the good side of life again.  I can't see living through 5 more years of this hell. 

I don't look forward to anything, I'm afraid to hope for anything anymore.

In this state I feel like I've done all I can.   It would be true mercy for me to get run over by a car

Eventually my mom barges in the room and asks why she's crying. This wasn't done with a comforting tone by the way. She seemed pissed that she was crying and was yelling at her already. So of course they start to argue intensely and at some point my mom says quite aggressively that her and I are terrible children

Note to all, we don't get into trouble, the typical ""goody good"" children. I admit that we can both be real brats sometimes but at least I acknowledge it. My mom doesn't seem to be willing to admit any fault for the way our relationship is. 

My mom also attacked my sister in terms of religion, asking if she's even a Christian with the way she's acting. Eventually she just stopped talking and let my mom say whatever else it is she wanted to say. My mom stormed out eventually and I finally went in my room. I didn't know what to do so I just put a blanket on her while she was sitting on the floor and rubbed her back a bit. A few minutes later she gets up and grabs what I assumed was a bottle of pills. 

This is where I feel fucking shitty about my useless self. I heard the rattle of the pills but I knew she wasn't the type of person to. I figured

The solid, to become a god! Complete, utter control over the thing I hold most sacred to my breast, the very notion of life! It makes life so precious, when one can fully accept that it can easily end in seconds. Precious is the sound of rains, the slender figures of trees in my peripheral visions, the scents of the grasses bending and flattening in the torrential pours. There is an inescapable beauty to feel the utmost control
I walk, surrounded by the beckoning trees, protecting, looming over me. I call 911 and whisper my location. ""I will pull the guns trigger in two minutes time, please clean my bloodied head as much as you can before returning it to my family."" I would turn the phone off, and watch it fall to the ground as if in slow motion, sinking in a mud puddle. 
I take off my jacket and fully embrace the rains, just accept it, accept the entire world, the rains soaking through my very skins, accept life as an insubstantial, temporary form, the true beauties of nature and far off mysterious universes remaining. Lifting my arms far above my head, the other clenching the gun, TRULY
Desperation and sudden violent urges often consume my mind, pull a plastic bag from the drawers near the back door, and retreat to the garage late at night. I would kneel on the cold cement floor, ignoring the long centipedes that scramble past frantically. Then I would begin to slam my head against the unforgiving floor, relishing the headache that quickly rings after, the solid feeling of all the circling thoughts disappearing at last. Slam, slam, til I see stars in the complete darkness, the bag pulling in closer to my nostrils and half opened mouth with each deep breath
Staring at the student profile packet, and have a lack of motivation for doing anything- even activities I used to enjoy. Everything is so overwhelming and tiring. This has been my daily reality for the past four years, no breaks. A long dark tunnel, with no escape, fingernails bloody from scratching at the curved walls- but there are no doors- nothing- just my panting and the ghostly laughters- just on and on- nothing-
Even the word 'feelings' causes a subconscious recoil, depression, worthlessness, and restlessness have plagued me. It's always there, always letting me know my efforts at writing and drawing are and always will be utterly futile. But now I am supposed to quantify this lethargy, and show it to the school, the world. People continue to ask what is wrong- I say nothing. I just want to be left alone! Left to my own devices! I don't want others to care for me, such laziness- squandering away all these opportunities to actually prove the potential I was born with. I deeply hate myself. Cutting no longer satisfies, and my awful grades and motivation will be forgiven. Everyone dies eventually, and I am still alive- then perhaps I had enough hope to show you this- but trust what I say. There is no reason to even get better. I hate myself so deeply

He's 26

Over the past few months

Things got worse though. He has started to distance him self from me when he used to be very affectionate. He got more and more depressed. When I asked him about it, buy a whole new wardrobe) and that he thought our marriage was a mistake but that he loves me and never wants to say goodbye to me. After lots of talking, he admitted that even if he made those changes, he would still be unhappy. Again he brushed it off as his frustrations at work and said he would work through it.

Tonight, he started talking to her again. It escalated from his chatting on the computer with her to him now texting her. The main reason why this bothers me is because every time he starts talking to her, he gets depressed and it starts effecting our relationship. He has been acting suspicious about his phone lately so it didnt take long for me to figure out he went from chatting with her to texting her. I had to talk to him about it.

I kept it civil. He freely admitted that he was, and talking about huge changes. He said yes. He describes her as ""a thought provoking catalyst that when stripped of all things superficial, he can only see him self in"". Her reentry into our life has been kind of a last straw for me. I knew she was back and have been thinking about leaving. So I asked him what he would do if I left, he said ""keep on living"". I asked him if he wold care if I left, he told me to leave if I want to and find what makes me happy. I tried to explain to him how much this relationship with this girl effects our marriage and how much it hurts me.

He broke Down. He started saying things about how ""he tried"" and how he is a horrible human being with evil un fixable flaws that are geneticly encoded in him. He said he has tried to ignore tem and he can't. He says he can't feel empathy and can't hide that fact any longer. 

I'm sorry this is so long but I feel the back ground plays an important role. 2 years ago when he was depressed, and seemed to get better. Tonight he told me he did that same thing again 2 weeks before our wedding. I told him I love him and I'm committed to making this work and he told me to give him 6 weeks and it'll be ok. We'll be coming up on our anniversary around then. He said after that ""you'll do just fine"". I asked what he meant why that and he told me about the second semi incident. Then he told me again that Ill be just fine and remarry someday. He then asked for me to leave him alone so he could go to bed. I've checked, he is just sleeping.

I have no idea what to do. He refuses to see a professional. I'm so scared he'll try something again. I love him so much and just want to help him, or confusing. I'm just so lost and don't want him to harm him self.

Following is the note I wrote to my family and will be mailed to them. I don't know who you are

-----------------------------------------------------

My dear family
I know you have many questions, nor do I wish to use guilt to torment. I am not upset over the relationships I have developed with others. It is not because I feel abandoned or unloved.

When I was a teenager

But I persevered. And life did not improve. I felt so lonely and helpless. I desired freedom. Freedom from the pain of middle school. I felt excluded from others. I was hurt so many times during those years. I am so sick of being sad. I cannot handle it any longer. I was given a privileged life

I cannot continue the drudgery of my life. I have spent too long living in a world that I see in beige. I am unable to feel the joy that others seem to experience. It's as if my senses have been reduced to the blandest of tones. The boredom. The repetition. The disappointment. I feel as though I am slowly wasting away. It has been a slow death.

You tried to help me. But

I wish this was not going to hurt you. I wish I were able to spare you this pain. Knowing my suicide would harm you provided the only motivation to continue living. I am amazed that I delayed for so long. But living to spare others from suffering cannot be the only justification to continue living. Everyone dies

Dad

Mom, you confessed your concern about my suicide. Maybe you know me better than I know myself.

(Brother 1), and try to forgive them when they are angry. I hope you can find an activity that will compel your interest for the rest of your life. Your intelligence and commitment will take you far.

(Brother 2)

It is too easy to overlook or forget small, inside jokes, warm pats on the back, basement sleepovers, and affectionate surprises. Those are the times worth living for.

I wish there were a way I could remove your pain right now as you read this. I wish I could hold your hand one last time.

When I was in first grade, just think of me as away at college, fulfilling my dream.

Your loving friend

I know how it feels to think that everyone hates you, to feel ugly, to feel as if you have absolutely no energy at all, to regret and dwell (and dwell, and dwell, and dwell) on all of the bad choices you’ve made in the past, to feel you have no worth or purpose, “Oh my god

I just thought I'd remind you (and myself): YOU NEED TO FORGIVE YOURSELF! YOU NEED TO START LOVING YOURSELF!

Believe me, even if your job sucks, even if you’re jobless. You feel like you have no skills? You do. You have many skills! You have things that are beautiful and wonderful and lovely about you. Times may be tough right now, but things HAVE to improve from here. And, there are about a million things you can do to feel better. Talk to someone (even if it’s just a school counselor). Perhaps find the right anti-depressant for you (I know that can be especially difficult, but it’s necessary for some of us). Re-invent yourself. Lose the folks who make you feel like shit, yes, better yet

Anyone who judges you for mistakes you've made, don’t be so hard on yourself. You’re human. We all have our faults and regrets. You need to accept yourself.

Their terror of falling from a great height is still just as great as it would be for you or me standing speculatively at the same window just checking out the view; i.e. the fear of falling remains a constant. The variable here is the other terror, looking up and yelling ‘Don‘t!’ and ‘Hang on!’, can understand the jump. Not really. You'd have to have personally been trapped and felt flames to really understand a terror way beyond falling.

I find myself wishing I didn't have anyone who loved or cared about me so I could have an easier time making my exit.  The thought of leaving everything and putting an end to this personal hell becomes increasingly more seductive as the days go on.  Well today

I'm a pretty private person (aside from venting on Reddit).  I don't like people to know that I'm having a hard time and I don't like asking for help.  Whether it's a pride/ego issue, this gets unbelievably tiring and exhausting.  Sometimes you slip up and you just want to be heard.

So I posted a status on my Facebook:

""People are doing great things with their lives
What the hell am I doing? I feel like I've been holding onto a match and a candle without its wick.""

In that moment I didn't care who saw it or responded

Well the morning drags on and that relief wears off.  I'm not doing a very good job at my work and I'm just hoping the day will end quickly so I can go back home to be alone and away from everyone.  Then one of my co-workers walks by my window and comes up to my desk.

We are acquaintances

""I've noticed you haven't been doing so well.  I want you to have this for a while.  It helped me when I was in a really bad place in my life and I was making very bad decisions.  I want you to keep this at your desk and look at it everyday like I did.  It helped me be brave.  We're in the same tribe.""

I had a rush of happiness, but it still gives me some hope.  It's a very, very dark place where we're at...it's nice to see some light once in a while, even if it's just for a brief moment.  I sincerely hope this makes your day just a little bit better just as it has for me.

1346621427.0,z8x7y,From legitimately suicidal to hopeful about the future in 11 months. Please read my story.,thingsWILLgetbetter1,39,7,9,"Okay guys I know that when your real down nothing is going to make you feel better in that moment

Some background: my mother has been a SEVERE alcoholic since I was 11, blacked out, to do...whatever she was doing. She is currently in prison for her second stint this year (DUI's).

I'm 24 now, slender build)- the body image issues were compounded when I ate myself into a full, deep, purple set of stretch marks surrounding my entire torso when I kicked my pain killer addiction, replacing it with weed and binge eating in my junior year of college. The stretch marks came only shortly after developing a classic case of plaque psoriasis which had spread to my private parts(this was when/why i got into pain killers.)

Because I had no other friends, fucked up people I've ever met. He constantly belittled me and made it clear I was fucking worthless. He did this without being direct about it because the guy had no fucking balls. Not only that but I realized he was talking shit about me to EVERY ONE of our mutual friends/aquentances. I would hear him and one of his butt buddies constantly making fucked up jokes about me and laughing hysterically through the walls of our place. Eventually he started dating another narcissist and their favorite activity was making me feel worthless. Psycho-lingo would assume that I was a classic example of ""secondary narcissistic supply"".

After graduating in '11(which was a major feat considering I skipped 2/3 of my classes simply because of social anxiety) I had no job prospects, she reluctantly agreed. Shortly thereafter she went to prison during which time I stayed at her place and gambled away all the money I had to live on. When I was about to run out of food she became eligible for early release and I was her sponsor for that. As soon as her parole officer completed the home sweep she busted out the booze and went to town. She informed me (while still on parole, while I was still her sponsor) that a ""friend"" was coming in from out of town and I had to leave for the weekend. So basically she was telling me to get the fuck out so she could fuck some weird guy she met at the beach a while back. I had NOWHERE TO GO. Imagine having to steal your mother's phone while she's passed out, start redialing all her recent calls to find the man she invited and tell him if he showed up I would chop his balls off, then delete his contact info (I actually ""met"" this guy when I stupidly visited her at her beach house rental- he lived in the adjoined part of the duplex, everything about him screamed serial killer/rapist).

Her drinking continued to get way worse, the next day things got worse. I had to take her phone away from her again but she was too far gone. She assaulted me when I starting walking to my room with her phone and tried to push my down the stairs, ripping my shirt apart in the process. She then ran across the street and used a neighbors phone to call the police and try to have me arrested. The police came inside the house and summoned me upstairs. I was so flustered and randomly dehydrated that I could barely speak. I told them what happened and they wanted to see the torn shirt. They escorted me back to my room and immediately saw the pipe and weed on my desk. This is when I decided I definitely wanted to kill myself. By the grace of god, the lead cop on the scene had a heart. He pardoned the weed, pretended he never saw it and arrested my mother for assaulting me. The friction burns on my neck and the torn shirt were all the evidence he needed, not to mention the fact that she was an intoxicated, crazy fuck.

After this happened I stayed with a friend for a couple months until I was somehow able to make my father understand he needed to help me. He began to support me financially with the understanding I was not going to be able to support myself for a while. I now have financial security which is huge. I am seeing a great therapist who gets what I'm going through. I'm eating right and exercising. The weight loss has reduced the appearance of the stretch marks. My father has agreed to fund cosmetic surgery for both the stretch marks and the man boobs(coming clean about these body issues was like pulling teeth

I'm still unemployed but I'm looking for a job for the first time since college. I stopped smoking weed three days ago because I know I'm finally ready to handle life without it. It's rough right now but in a few weeks I will be so happy with myself for it. I'm not saying my depression is ""cured"" or anything like that, but was able to bounce back by forcing myself to work out with some upbeat music. It's SO fucking hard but forcing yourself to run or get some type of exercise or sunlight is really important. So there it is guys, I'm not out of the woods and never will be with the cyclical nature of depression but for the first time in a long time, I can deal with life. Everyone's situation is different but remember this story when your feeling like doing something terrible to escape the pain. Eleven months ago I really felt like suicide was the only option- today I feel like I can lead a healthy, somewhat happy life managing my anxiety/depression.

Tl;DR I've had a pretty fucking rough go at it the last five years, no job, shitty EVERYTHING. Thought suicide was my best option 11 months ago. Today I see hope for my future.

Hi. Name's Jarred and I'm 20. I've read in the past of people posting up their problems in life

Please respond with advices or progressive remarks. 
___________________________________________________________________________________

So

I am the youngest of a Christian family. My mother and sister are very religious while my two brothers hates Gays and even feminine metro guys.


I was exposed to explicit videos when I was about 7 or 8


Being gay in high school is a very sad thing. Although no one knew, I could improvise but I hated it, lying to myself and saying things that 'real' guys says. So I went through high school, with piratically no 'real' social life. I didn't get any invites to any parties or gatherings. I wasn't the nerdy loner in school, people knew me and smiles; but I was if I ever attended a party since I really couldn't provide any conversations.


Back then, I didn't mind. Keeping my 'issues' to myself. As time passes by, I became very cautious of things I shared with everyone (including my friends).


Uni life was fine until the last 2 years, I've never felt so alone. It just gets worst over time. I cry every single night before I fall asleep, because I knew I had no friends. It was very depressing. So what if I have over 400+ friends on Facebook, probably only about 5 actively communicate with me, and that's cause we share the same classes at uni. I sit in the uni lounge with my group and I see many couples flirting, hugging, holding hands, I will never be able to hold another's hand or be romantic. It really puts me down. In my uni, but before he graduated I told him about myself (in a letter


I am of Chinese background, I may as well be not live.


About 6 months ago, I though they wanted to be friends but when they see I wasn't in for the same thing. They just tossed me aside. A few of these instances occurred, I felt like dirt. I opened up to them, cause I though they'd understand, since they are alike. At the start it felt really good, to be seen/loved/liked for who I am. Talking to people alike, I let my guard down but I see now it's a mistake. I fell into depression, I put on a mask. I'm always happy


3 months back, placed it in an enveloped and dated it. It was a letter to my mother, coming out to her. On the day, I sat with her as she read it. In disappointment, she said that it was alright to like baking and be a bit feminine. Since she liked to hang out with boys when she was younger, and she said that the-man-upstairs will make me fall in love with the girl I want to marry later in life. And tells me not to worry about it and focus on my studies, as she tore the letter into pieces so my siblings won't see it. 


So yes



**Currently:** *aka* **;TLDR;**

I'm currently lost in my life. I have very low self-confidence. I feel I no longer have a motive to live. I cry and think about my death every night. I think about dying in someone else's place. I think about life if I ran away


I don't even know why I am studying any more. I am even losing interest in games or any of my past-times. Life in general is becoming a daze for me.



*So please enlighten me on what to do

1324581371.0,nmxrz,I think I'm a pedophile. I've firmly decided to blow my brains out if I can't change this within a year.,thr0w4w4y23948239874,35,4,44,"Deep breaths.

I think I'm a pedophile. Feel free to hit me with your worst. I deserve it, as one would reasonably assume, and I am simply incapable of harming a child. It's all relegated to the confines of fantasy. That's the only positive thing (all things considered) about the situation. The desire for kids to be safe from such harm trumps my (relatively low) sex drive ten to one, and I do not pose any sort of danger to children or any person other than myself. The idea of me or any adult actually doing something sexual to a child is upsetting and revolting to me. Sexual abuse infuriates me. But that's the catch: I'm infuriated with myself for even thinking about children in that way. That's why I decided today to set my final goal: Either I find a way to fucking stop being this way by December 22nd 2012, or I eat a bullet. Make no mistake, I am 100% serious about this ultimatum. 12/22/12 is judgement day for me. If I can't change, that's it. No hesitation

I'm more attracted to adults by a decent margin, and I can do that indefinitely, but that's not good enough. I just can't and *won't* carry on living if this is really what I have to be forever, no matter how in control of it I am, because I fucking despise myself for this. Pedophilia is pure evil and evil must be wiped from the face of this planet if we can ever hope to advance as a species.

It hurts so much because I was abused as a kid too. I *know* why pedophilia is so horrible because it absolutely ruined my childhood and turned me into such a miserable, as if it started out as an attempt to 'disarm' some specific memories of the sexual abuse so they wouldn't torment me so much. Through fantasy, I basically relive the memory in some altered form over and over again, with the people and circumstances changed around from the ones present in the event itself. If I somehow conditioned myself into being this way, perhaps I could condition myself back out of it. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm rationalizing. Who the fuck knows? Or even cares?

As hard of a time that you might have believing it, preventing it from snowballing into something even worse. And that same instinct is the driving force behind this ultimatum I've given myself. If I can't make myself see kids in the normal way that healthy people see them, then my existence cannot be justified. I would be doing parents, kids, and myself a huge favor by just bowing out. Like I said, I'm not a danger to children, so my death wouldn't make anyone safer, which was when the person who I should've been died forever. But most importantly

What the fuck should I do? What would you do? The more I ramble about this shit

This is the mantra I repeat everyday and to many people. 
This is not only what they want to, must hear, but also what I have to remind myself of.
My body is covered with scars
I have seen more then I care to, that allows me to still hope and foster joy.
I have been raped twice
I have been screamed at and hit.
I have cut myself.
I have tried to kill myself
People who should have kept me safe
 
**And
 
Even after hitting the two and half year mark
Even after my new support system was built and I escaped my old life
Knowing now that I will never see either of my rapists again
Knowing now
Knowing now what I do about how happy it makes me to be pagan and open with my sexuality
But I can't.
 
**And
 
I have made mistakes.
I have had careless sex.
I have hurt people.
I have been selfish.
I am loud.
I am pretentious to a degree.
I am either an open book or a gated community.
I am still learning to be beautiful.
I still feel like it hurts to admit I can be wrong in large ways.
I have done things so unbearably stupid
I get overly emotional.
The more I dislike someone or something
 
But.
 
**I am ok.**
 
And for what it matters
I forgive those who've shown me real harm.
I forgive those people for raping me and showing me at an early age what sex was.
I forgive you for calling me names and beating me
I forgive you for showing me that there were things I could and should hate about my body.
 
 
What is more though
I forgive myself for my self-harm and being a wreck for a large part of my life.
I forgive myself for being difficult.
I forgive myself for making it out to be my fault over the rapes and sexual abuse. 
I forgive myself for an occasional brash and irrational nature
I forgive letting other people harming me cloud judgement of those who love me and for allowing myself to dislike myself moreso over it.
I forgive myself on occasion for being irrevocably me.
 
It is the mantra I say to myself in the morning when waking up is hard.
It is the mantra I repeat in the mirror when I hate what I see there.
It is the mantra I tell people who think I need more meds
 
From this pain
From this rape
From that and those abuses
From my mistakes
 
I became jaded at a young age
I grew weary
The kind that still hopes and smiles when sad
 
I just do not want you to worry
The simple mantra that I hope you know is becoming more and more true to me.
 
**I am ok.**
 
*Please* get help. It gets better and things change and I did it, even with all of these things. You are fucking capable, and hard as it is, life is beautiful. 
It is so beautiful.

Anyway, but I can tell that the subconscious part of my mind that makes decisions is divided.  Part of me wants to quit, part of me doesn't.

I think the main reason against is that I can easily imagine it killing my mother, and she just loves me so much.  My parents wanted children but had to try for 10 years just to get one, me, and when I think about it, it would be unconscionable to throw that away.  I'm so pragmatic that I know *I* can't regret it, after I cease to exist, but right now just the thought of hurting my mom like that is what's kept me from doing anything.

Don't get me wrong. I barely know you.  
So what I have to say may not really affect your life at all.  
But it's still something I'm going to say

It's not your fault.  
You're just a human being like the rest of us.  
Even successful people have problems.  

And something else.  
You aren't a failure. You never were.  
You may feel like you aren't doing anything with your life. That all day long you do 'nothing'.  
But I just want you to remember this.  

You're where you are right now
Doing nothing isn't a 'waste' of life or talent. It's something that you yourself wanted more than anything
Other people expect or demand things out of you
They don't want to see you become unhappy. They don't think that you're doing what you wanted to do.  
You are loved. In some way
You may be loved by someone you've never even met. But their love is there regardless.

Well

&gt;In order to create an ideal world, has the duty to live in the same way that Christ is depicted. What this means is, every man must live by unconditionally loving his neighbour. For people to live in peace and happiness, there can be no hate or desire for others’ misfortunes in their hearts. Why? Because in a world in where everyone is happy, someone who wishes ill to another cannot be happy, since his happiness depends on the suffering of the latter. And if everyone is to be happy, no one can suffer.

&gt;Christ’s cross is to represent the burden this love implies. The world is far from utopian, those who sincerely love others will suffer when they err.
&gt;
&gt;And this is why I want to apologise to everyone, I have been unable to carry this burden. I believe that in my determination to alleviate others from their problems, I rejected their offers of help; I rejected my Simon of Cyrene. And there is no man more arrogant than a Christian who believes he can carry a burden bigger than that of Jesus himself. I could not carry my cross without Simon, and I do not want to ask for help, as I do not want to be a bother.
&gt;
&gt;And so, I apologise to all those I met and loved, and I hope I can one day be forgiven.

Firstly, let alone that I actually had it. And to be honest, to this day I still cannot bring myself to completely acknowledge it. Basically, I became quite self-conscious of my nose when I was 14. I was, and still do, at an all boy private grammar school, and so our contact with females was often sparse. This, I'd panic and it'd be a big ordeal for me. Over the year, trustworthy friends. People with whom I wasn't self-conscious around.

Thanks for staying with me, no one would have a clue I was this anxious about my appearance. So aside from the odd comment, ""you've been hanging at home a fair bit lately"", nothing was really made of my increasingly avoidant behaviour.

Now let's jump to midway through year 10, more accurately, them laying their eyes on me and my nose. This was when, a random attack occurred. It was one of the boys in the senior year. I was innocently walking down to the station when he threw an rock, at an extremely high speed, into my nose. It was a brutal and random attack. There was blood everywhere and I'd most certainly broken it. After a good month, and after the swelling had gone down, now noticing a very evident deviated septum (a hump) from the breaking and a bulbous tip, the fact that my parents only iced it, my BDD was so much worse. I'd spend hours looking at my nose

Now to the crux of it, and checking each one of them with flying colours, I became alarmed. As I have schemed since I was 15 about getting plastic surgery (for years I have also been using a NoseRight, to no avail) and when I read that sufferers develop an “obsession with plastic surgery often with little satisfactory results (in the perception of the patient)” I was emotionally floored. Could my dream nose be unachievable and unrealistic? I wasn’t sure. All I knew was that I didn’t want to get help about it in case anyone attempted to thwart my plan of obtaining rhinoplasty surgery.
About two weeks ago, I decided to visit the school’s psychologist (who is freely accessible) and I told her some things about it. She diagnosed me after a two sessions and has urged me to speak to my parents, so I stopped going. As an 18 year old, I am an adult, and so legally, she cannot intervene further, without my consent. 

I have no idea what to do, and this is the truth, I see true happiness with a better nose. I do. But now I have this tiny yet excruciating feeling of doubt about everything: that my perceptions are warped, that my dream of surgery is all a lie and that maybe I will never be happy, not even with the surgery. Additionally, I am dealing with this in my final year of school, in which an introverted persona is not favourable. I need some sympathy, but this is seriously getting me down...",t5_2qpzs,True

Considering going back to the psych hospital. 5th day still wide awake, my body is in fight or flight mode all the time. It feels like its dying all the time. It cant deal.

Nothing great has happened but sooo many terrible things have. I don’t want to give in and let them win, im still here. Im so close to the end though. My body is far more than ready, my soul is the only thing pleading to continue. But I feel like a major part of me has already been reincarnated. I keep holding out because of the finality of suicide. Don’t know what’s on the other side. But it wont be this broken body. 
I haven’t even talked about the complete invasion of my life by the insurance company and how they hack your facebook and anything online to gather information. They cant use it, police dmv, credit, academic, anything and everything. It was a stack of binders over ten inches tall. Wtf? I didn’t ask for this? I just wanted to do my job and help people and do good by my fellow humanity. I’m at my wits end. I can’t handle this. I’ve thought about so many methods of how to do it. I’ve settled for one that leaves my organs un-poisoned and intact so that a 5 donor recipients can live through my death. So this is it. I’ll be making a video for my friends and family explaining all this and to reassure them and ease the confusion and chaos that usually surrounds a suicide. People usually ask “why” well I want to let them know I was hurting and ready to go. I’m ready

1348253810.0,109f4w,Just wanted to share a real life story of suicide,pucciom2,39,8,26,"I'd like to start by saying i am in no way a therapist of any kind or have any experience in dealing with people who are thinking about suicide

April 15, along with my step-brother, there was a certain excitement in the air about graduating.  I had gone to school and stayed after school had ended to pay for a ticket i owed to go to prom.  My stepbrother had gone home for the day.  I return home and go to my room, which was in the basement while my bro was upstairs.  I'm playing video games and pretty much doing my thing while i get a call from my bro's gf.  She is frantic and telling me i need to talk to him because he is upset and mentioned something about having a gun.  I nonchalantly tell her i'll talk to him and reassure her everything is going to be okay.  I go to his room yelling his name, but i can't find him.  I look all over the house and he apparently stepped out.  So i go to the park at the edge of the block and circle it looking for him, again to no avail.  There was one room i didn't look in which was our parents room because it's almost always locked and we never go in there.  I nervously open the door and what i found changed my life forever.  I see my beloved bro laid out on the floor in a pool of crimson red.  The revolver was also lying on the floor.  Our cat ran through the door when i opened it so i actually had to jump over my bro's lifeless body to get her out of the room.  I will never forget that sight.  I immediately call the police and they were in my house in minutes.  I  had told them my stepbrother committed suicide, but later i found out the call went in that there was a hostage situation and shots had been fired.  The police greet me with guns in my face telling me to get down on the ground.  I'm handcuffed and put in the back of the police car.  It soon becomes apparent to them that this was self inflicted and un-handcuff me.  They take me to the station and tell me to give them the number to all the family i know.  I comply and i witnessed one by one each family member walk into the station as they break the news to them.  They decided to tell my family about my bro's death only after they reached the station.  So i witnessed my family and friend's heartbreak as they came in.  My parents were in Hawaii and the police thought it was best if i told them.  So the burden was put to me to give the worst news they have ever heard.

I would say this event had been tough on everyone, three years later no one is over his death.  While the tears have slowed the pain of losing family has not subsided, especially with his father.  His father drinks occasionally and it gets to the point where he is in tears thinking about his son's death.  My brother and two sisters have joined suicide watch groups and have advocated greatly, especially the out of darkness walks that take place yearly for those thinking about suicide.  I on the other hand don't know how to deal with the loss.  I don't take my frustrations and energy into raising money for awareness, or even tell my story to anyone except close friends.  I have suffered through depression and post-traumatic stress from the event.
but through this all there is still hope.  Everyday i know he is my guardian angel and protects me when no one else can.
Still
Suicide is not ending your own life.  It is hurting everyone you have ever known and loved.  So the only thing i ask of someone who is considering suicide is to really think about all the people that it will effect

I'm still in the icu and have been way better from yesterday where I felt like shit and vomited brown shit. Now I feel loads better and can eat solids. I'm gonna get moved to the psych ward and the doctors figured out I have a thyroid problem which might have been the cause of my weight gain which led to my eating disorder and suicidal thoughts.

I'm 28 years old. I'm mostly self-sufficient. I've got a job pays decently well (though I have to do freelance and will probably need a third job on top of that), and mainly do all the things people are supposed to do in order to maintain their lives. 

It's soul crushing. I've already made the decision that if I were suddenly to find myself in a life threatening situation

Everything costs money. Food costs money. Rent costs money. Electricity costs money. The simple act of being alive, living, is an effort. A huge effort. It's not a default state but something that must be consciously maintained. You have to eat. You have to have shelter. You have to go to the dentist. You 
have to go to the doctor. And these all take time and cost money. There are no alternatives. Capitalism won the Cold War. This is society. This is the way things are done. This is LIFE. 

And Communism was no walk in the park either

We work to get money. We wake up. Brush our teeth. Put on a tie

Life is full of worries. That project needs to be completed by Friday. That freelance assignment needs to be done by Monday. You've got to call the exterminator and get these silverfish out of your bathroom. And these are just your immediate worries. Meanwhile

Other people deal with it. You're not so self absorbed as to think that you're the only one suffering. You're not so naive to think you have it so bad. You live in a first world nation. You can get clean water whenever you want. You eat every day. You're comparatively healthy (though, already accept? Why can't you just work for a living and like it? You entitled little shit. You're exactly what's wrong with America. Everyone works. You hate your job? So does every god damn fucking person in the world. THEY don't wanna die. Why do you? 

Because it's like a light switch going off in your head. One minute you're here. The next you're not. And all your problems vanish. You vanish. It doesn't matter that you've worked as hard as you can but you can't complete that project. It doesn't matter that your freelance assignments have dried up. It doesn't matter that you need to find a third god damn job on top of the two you already have. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters. Because you're dead. You don't have to worry about anything. Life is no longer happening to you. There's no need for decisions. No need for stress. No need for work. There's not even a need for a burial plot -- you don't care what happens to your body. Let some necrophiliac carve your corpse full of brand new orifices for all you care. 

You don't have to worry. About anything. 

Change jobs? God, but it's so much effort. Scouring jobs boards, going to networking events, writing cover letters, it's all so much much work. And you'll still be miserable. It's not the specific job. It's jobs in general. It's life in general. It's responsibilities in general. There will always be something that grinds you into dust. One leg gets tired, so you shift your weight until the other leg gets tired and then you shift your weight again over and over and over. I just want to sit down, but everyone else is standing. I'm just fucking lazy. Things that come easy to others is an arduous task for me. Getting out of bed, depresses me because I know it will be yet another day full of soul crushing responsibility. I'm not so entitled to think I deserve to not have to do with every god damned person does. But

So: death. 

I don't know what, I'm the most cheerful fucking guy in the world. But I'm rotting like a soft log in a shallow pond, from the inside out. And one day. I'll split.

I don't have any real friends. I just have some acquaintances who I talked to in classes in high school. I'm sure some of you know how that is.

And it's tough to make any friends at this community college because it's small and there's not a lot to do and I feel people don't like me. I'm also trying to find a job like many people but it's tough.

The reason I have to go to the community college is because my grades in high school dipped off around 11th grade ever since I realized how much of a socially awkward idiot I had been. It made me extremely depressed even as it gave me the motivation to change. I wish I had done better in school so I didn't have to go here

I pretty much gave up on having a girlfriend a while ago

I started thinking about suicide in 11th grade and it became a daily part of my thought processes around 6 months ago. I spend a lot of time crying because I wish I felt needed or useful. I became more social, and still have nothing.

Medication has never really helped me. I've tried every medication you've heard of and some you haven't and none of them helped. I visited a psychiatrist again a few months ago but they have nothing new to offer me. I even shelled out the money to try Abilify, long time. It's not as though waiting any more will do any good, since every passing day makes me more unemployable.

I have a great group of friends I've known for years and a part time job that's halfway decent (which says a lot in these economic times). 

And yet I have never felt so alone in my entire life. All my friends keep bouncing in and out of relationships yet here I am, amazing sense of humour, the works and yet here I am on another night all alone on the internet. At least with my mother around, despite the fact that we ended up hating each other towards the end, there was someone to go home to. Now there's no one. The moment I stop being around others to socialize, or have work to do, or hell even weed to smoke I fall into a deep dark depression that makes it hard for me to talk or breathe. This even happens in front of my friends and I spend hours just trying not to break down in front of them.

I've soon come to realize that there's a gap in my heart. A void if you will. For the past 6 years I've never been able to even score a first date. For some reason I've been put on this earth in a form that cannot be liked or loved or cared about. Despite having a small group of close friends I have never spent the night with someone else in my bed or had a kiss or anything. I'm just a lonely fool. (This is a slight exaggeration because I have had one LDR that resulted in one weekend being spent with someone but that was years ago) In the end I can't stand this. I've taken every piece of advice thrown at me and have realized that I have not done anything wrong. People are always trying to find fault in me when the fact of the matter is I'm not doing anything wrong. People just don't see me as someone they can love. I can't live my life as a foreveralone. I just wanted the internet to know that I'm sick and tired and done with it.

He has suspected Asperger's syndrome but a diagnosis either takes three years in the public healthcare system or costs 1000$ in the private healthcare system. So we don't have a diagnosis and because of this he's in denial about it (but only when it suits him). He's getting help from an autism spectrum community organization but it's really just paperwork for now.

We have good times but also really rough patches. When we hit a tough time we can argue every day

I was seeing a psychologist but she's from the public healthcare system and basically she just told me my allotted visits have run out. I don't feel like anything is much better than it used to be when I started seeing her and now I'm losing her.

I don't know where to start, says he'll try things, but nothing ever happens. He cheated on me and when we tried to patch things up, I wrote him an email for him to answer in multiple parts so it wouldn't be too much at once. He answered the first part but when I sent the second, he never got back to me. He has zero initiative, doesn't approach me for sex, when I approach him for sex he's super nervous and we barely connect, and I'll be super busy all week trying to wrap things up at work, why don't I come up with something to say.

It's dumb to even talk about it. Everything is always an issue. We always end up fighting and I break up with him and he gives me attitude and I feel responsible and we try to fix things and he says he'll try to take better care of me and does something right there on the spot but never follows through. I feel lonely, horrible all around.

When we've been fighting for too long (days and days) I get vivid images of throwing myself off my balcony, I've tried and it doesn't work, the moments when we do (or did) connect are (were) too precious to me and I can't let go of the possibility that it could get better.

I am not any of those things. What people need are goals, or a dream, or really, anything to keep as the light in the darkness that leads you down the path one step at a time. When therapists or whatever talk about ""hopelessness,"" it sounds like a load of shit -- it's not hopelessness. It's the lack of a goal, of direction -- it is the lack of that something that doesn't *make* us alive, but rather *keeps* alive, rather than live *through*. When I was younger, or to med school

I look at my friends in college planning out their lives now, to get a family and have kids. Others are planning for a life in music (which, to be honest, has always been my dream), others in medicine, others in something else. At the end of the day, all I have appeared to others is as a ""good"" person -- but what does appearing ""good"" entail? I am neither moral, nor honest; but I tell white lies to people and take that burden upon myself to give a third party some solace -- my being a good person is but an appearance

I am too far in my life to change these things. I have written an album, as though I am trying to piece together the different melodies in my life. No one I have shown it to is impressed - they are disturbed, unsettled, turned away from it and towards the shallow shit music we have today. And that is my problem -- that is my decaying dream -- that has taken that goal, that light in the darkness, and extinguished it. I am groping my way through the night, hoping for a rope, but it's not there. It has been lost -- and with it, that by realizing that life is meaningless

I am not an Übermensch, and I want to say I am a strong enough person to defeat my demons, and I want to *be* that strong person. But in my moment of reason, I have to admit that I'm not. Reason only takes us so far -- reason can take words and bend them into such shapes and forms that we manage to justify the death of 6 million people as ""ethnic cleansing."" Reason can take words and justify that a man making a billion dollars should be taxed less than my dad.

I am at the boundaries of my own logic, whether it takes me slowly up the path out of the darkness or further into it, I am completely helpless to decide on my own.

I applied for unemployment, and now almost 3 yr old daughter. I was given all three... but the unemployment payments were and still are very very little. I get about 150 a week. Our food stamps are enough to keep us fed. But the unemployment has mainly gone to pay our electricity, and buy needed items for our daughters, diapers/blankets/clothes etc...

on the 8th of the month, otherwise she'd go through the eviction process. On the day of my newborn daughter's birth, my mother called her and advised her we need more time... she agreed to let us stay til the 31st. 

I have still not paid her for the month of July. And have 3 days to get out of here with nowhere to go, and no hope of finding available services from the state as i was informed yesterday that waiting lists are 2-4 years long right now.

Let me introduce myself. For simplicity's sake, Germany. I lived in a very secluded, separate part of town, so we were pretty isolated. There was only one other kid to play with, let's call him Steve. Steve was about 4 years older than me. We became very close and spent pretty much all of our free time together. What I did not know and was not old enough to know was that Steve was a pretty sick kid. It started small, with him showing me his first pubes. Eventually, it evolved to him challenging me and my brother, which basically consisted of rubbing our penises on a wall. One day he decided he wanted to have sex with us and tried to get us to blow him. I refused because he peed from there. He then tried to give anal, so I learned to speak English fluently and I have an American passport. My time there is relatively uneventful until I hit the early stages of puberty at around 12. I started to become increasingly depressed and developed severe anxiety. whenever I was left alone I could not stop thoughts of my parents and family being burned alive, I dont remember my first motivation to pick up the knife and try It for the first time

I was recently arrested (about four months ago) for two felony drug possession charges. My house was raided because my roommate, I answered to a knock on the door to a gun in my face, and all of a sudden dozens of cops started running into my house. They had a warrant to search the entire premises. During that time, I had anti-anxiety medicine (not prescribed to me) in my possession, as well as weed, safely kept in my bedroom. The police searched my room, found the drugs
I was in school to become a teacher. I was student teaching during the time of the arrest. My students were everything to me, and knowing this is what I wanted to do. I would occasionally take a half of one of the anti-anxiety meds before teaching to lower my heartbeat and feelings of nervousness, hence the reason I had them. I tried going to therapy, but the doctors I saw never helped me and I just couldn't talk to them. I have a hard time talking to anyone. I would come home, do my homework, and smoke a few bowls once I was finished with all of my work to relax, and as a reward at the end of the day. I enjoyed it, or brought the drugs out of my house. I am a very introverted person
In the few months following the arrest, and move out of my house. I lost the few friends I did have due to my depressive, introverted personality. I currently live with my boyfriend, who is incredibly supportive. My parents are disappointed in me. All I ever wanted to do was make them proud, help people, and just be happy with my life. I feel as if I have lost almost everything that meant anything to me.
I finally am facing the fact that I might actually do time in jail. I have a good lawyer
All I wanted to do in this world was live a life helping people, and become a convicted felon is driving me back into a downward spiral. I am not a bad person. I have never stolen anything in my life, and I have never hurt a fly. I don't understand what I did to deserve this. I have considered suicide in the past, but never as much as I have now. I feel as if society and the world in general doesn't want me here. 
I have already planned my suicide entirely, to hear me. Give me your opinions if you choose, I am willing to accept anything anyone wants to say. Thank you for listening, Reddit.

Just talk to someone, they are trained to deal with people who are feeling like that. Or the people here, there are tons of people here who will offer their time to talk to you. I went to my doctor who is a cool guy, I was ready to talk to him but when I got in he handed me over to a med student so I was really reluctant and nervous talking to this person I've never met before. But once I started we just kept talking, and it got personal. I've told her things that I haven't told anyone else in the world. It got really emotional and we both got teary-eyed but in the end I felt a whole lot better. So please just talk to someone.

Also when my doctor can in she filled him in on what was happening and this is what he said

He said that one of the most common things people do to people with depression is just tell them to cheer up. But you can't just cheer up, we fix it but it will take some time. Michael J. Fox has parkinson's which happens when dopamine levels are low in the brain and it effects motor skills. He can't hold a pen still like you and I can. No one would tell Michael J. Fox 'Hey, cut it out, people are looking' because they know he has parkinson's and they know what that is. Depression is similar in that your sarotonin levels in the brain are low which effect your mood, we can use medication to bring those levels back up to where they need to be so that you can enjoy the things you like to do.

I'm a 19 year old female from Seattle, lots of gang activity, you name it. My parents divorced when I was four (or somewhere around then) because my father was abusive, so my mom raised us three kids by herself. I'm the youngest and have two older brothers.

My mother suffers from PTSD and bipolar disorder, even, for stuff we needed, a lot of the time.

Because I wasn't a very assertive child, because it meant I had to actively suppress a very large part of my personality to keep what little peace we had in the household. Furthermore, my family (my brothers, mostly) got used to me being the shy one, so when I tried to assert myself, they laughed it off and brushed me aside, dismissing me as “dramatic” or “self-centered.”

When I was 12, I don’t remember exactly) was taking advantage of me sexually and had, quite possibly, given me an STD. The shame and guilt of it was overwhelming, and the feeling that, because I was so young, nothing I said mattered anyways, when everyone was sleeping, poised to cut

The rest of middle school/high school passed with nothing major happening. Money was tight. My brothers moved out, which paid off way more than I thought it would. I got into my top-choice school (Columbia University) early decision, was chosen as a recipient of the Gates Millennium Scholarship, and spent the majority of my first semester in college pretty convinced that everything would be much easier for the rest of my life.

Spring semester of my freshman year, it was hard to explain to my professors why I wasn’t able to come to class and why my work wasn’t up to its normal standards. Before I got home, I learned that two girls in high school who went to my church (different church than before) also killed themselves. It was a rough semester, and my grades reflected that.

This last summer, wanting nothing but to be away from my mother for as long as was humanly possible.

Last November

In January, originally thought to be accidental, was actually being investigated as a homicide with the possibility of sexual assault. Not long afterwards, around the anniversary of my friend’s suicide, a member of the church I attend in New York City was murdered as well.

I was back on the suicidal track. My grades were (are) suffering because of everything that’s happened, asking myself whether their lives would be completely devastated if I just wasn’t around anymore. I didn’t come up with anyone, and went to sleep, planning to come up with ideas for how I would end my life the next day.

I pushed it off for a few days, when I had a break from singing in the song, where I looked back at the group. I was completely surrounded by music. I met the eyes of everyone in the group and knew, in that instant, that I had another family. I felt happiness and completeness I didn’t even think was possible many, many days before, in the darkness and loneliness that was completely overwhelming at four in the morning. I had found something I truly loved, but also cared about me as a person.

I wish I could say that it was 100% happy from then on, underwent surgery, and found myself confined to a wheelchair three weeks before the end of the semester. My attendance, already spotty because of the depression issues, became such an issue for one of my professors that he asked me to withdraw from the class. Getting to class has been pretty tricky because our campus is just barely wheelchair accessible, so I’ve missed the last few class meetings for my remaining classes. I’m 99% sure I’m looking at academic probation for next semester, and my broken ankle means I don’t get to exercise as much as I have been this year

But I’m not here to bum you out. My point is that really, and I’ve survived them. Only just, but I've still survived.

My point is that I see that the apathy that is pervasive in our culture is toxic – fatally so.

My point is that my story is not the same as yours, a light at the end of the really, really dark tunnel you’re in. And, if you feel that there isn’t a single person who thinks that what’s happening to you doesn’t matter, I will tell you that **that’s not true.** I know that it matters. I know how much it hurts when people say it doesn’t matter.

Please hear me: it matters. **You matter.** Each and every one of us matters. And I’m going to work as hard as I possibly can for the rest of my life to convince as many people as I possibly can that that’s true.

**TL;DR -- I love you.**

I'm twenty years old. I've flunked out of college, lack of productive focus for my mind, and a lot of alcohol/marijuana/k2 spice. After a drunken burst of suicidal ideation last summer, I was forced to relocate out of state to live with my parents, and I then freeloaded off my family for several months. I worked a little but did almost nothing else productive for that duration.

I have a job now

My unresolved issues caused issue with each of my family members, who were generous enough to let me sleep here rent free. However, I found out today that, because of my inability to control my frustrations, they have kicked me out. I don't have anywhere else to go.

My depression stems from two places, suicidal alcoholic before I was able to even attempt to come to terms with it. I have been trying to start the process for many months now, but money, home situations, and politics have repeatedly gotten in the way, so I have had no emotional resolution in that area.

Because of this depression, and I had a lot of interests and loved learning. I can no longer even play a scale on my instrument, due to deterioration of muscles, I have an impossibly difficult time learning, and I have no motivation to fix these problems. I've tried, multiple times, but have been unable to keep it up.

To top things off, while I was heavily addicted to k2 spice (it's a stupid addiction, but whatever). I spent years believing myself to be - with some justification - a sociopath, and I think I've developed a conscience now. I'm afraid of my own mind, much of the time, when before I used to enjoy it. I need serious counseling, but I have too many other pressing concerns - money, etc. - and it's just not feasible right now.

Quite frankly, and I don't think I have the emotional resolve to do it. I have felt seriously suicidal a handful of times before, but none with the kind of calm resolve I have right now. It's so easy, and this suffering will be over with. I'm only typing this because I want someone out there to know why I did what I did.

My life is shit from almost every perspective. Brought to the US at the age of 14 unfortunately I didn't qualify to obtain legal residence in this country. Lived with my parents and my sister. My father was an alcoholic and aggressive idiot who didn't get legal residence in this country because of his past. Basically we all lived in fear at home because of him but we all stayed with him because we needed the money to help with the transition in this country. My mother became a citizen

I never managed to make new friends, I was almost 15 when we moved so I was already nearing adulthood. Sometimes I wonder if it wasn't the cultural shock but rather the treatment I received at home.

I did like shit in school, fights all the time at home, sister got into drugs so that put a lot of extra pressure on my parents, I felt fucking alone so I retreated to a deeper and darker place in my mind. Eventually I got depressed, managed to finish school with an embarrassingly low GPA which I didn't even care to find out what it was, passed algebra, chemistry, I had no life and working in group projects was fucking hell because I had to deal with normal people. I couldn't reach out for anyone

Fuck, the thing is that the last time I had a mcjob I would get anxious as hell when dealing with co-workers and the customer... I am even afraid of checking the mail if there's people outside. 

I managed to finish up to calc II in college (was working on a EE degree), but really, I didn't see myself going anywhere especially with what's going on around me. My mother is shit poor, doesn't have any savings, who knows if she's going to end up well and be able to hold a job after her last surgey (if it's even the last one) we don't even have our own home, we have around $5K CC debt which was accumulated after my father left... 

If I work, I just don't see myself making any progress earning money because the little I would make would disappear as soon as I got it by paying rent, utilities, and debt. Did I mention that if I get pulled over I could get deported? 

Part of me wants to get deported back to fucking Mexico, an agoraphobic/socially anxious/no life brother, a sick mother... me leaving would mean abandoning my mother to rot in debt and physical ailment... you just don't abandon those who care for you. What's for me back in Mexico if I get deported? I don't have a degree, my Spanish is decent both in speaking and writing but far from a professional level, I do have relatives but they are shit poor as well and mentally unstable...

I look at my options... I can't court a woman to even attempt to get married and get a green card because I am an emotional mess (never had a gf, loud, aggressive, get away with doing drugs at work, can't hold a conversation that isn't about tits or soccer. I took french in HS and college so I do have basic conversational skills, but even if I wanted to immigrate to Canada I would require to have a useful degree of some sort and even have money to do all the proceedings. Sometimes I do fix or build the occasional computer, build a basic home network, low grade IT skills

I tried college, and every day I wish I would get hit by a truck on the way home. It's a pointless endeavor. I would try to find a new hobby but everything I try bores the living shit out of me or is costs money, and when you don't have any it's hard to find something to do. 

I don't have any friends I actually appreciate. I don't appreciate them because they are in the same position I am in

Women drive me crazy. I thought I was in a picture perfect relationship that shit everywhere because it turned out that I lied to myself and made myself believed I loved a girl I didn't, but I wouldn't be content if I was in a relationship with her again. I would belittle her and take advantage of her anyway. I do my best to avoid relationships now because they seem to just get in the way of me trying to dig myself out of this shitpit that is my life, but no matter how much I focus on trying to get out of debt, it's never fast enough. No one is reliable. No one is dependable. No one has any fucking money. No one is industrious as I am and no one wants me around anyway so whats the fucking point? 

I'm fairly sure I've never actually felt love. All I have been able to do is fool myself into thinking I was in love. I haven't been able to feel happy since I left high school

I'm not motivated to do much of anything

The only constant in my life is feeling like shit, it's because I've convinced myself that feeling depressed is for weak people that can't get their heads screwed on the right way, but I'm pretty sure I'm the one that can't get his head screwed on the right way. 

I squandered all the money I made in the last 4 years on stupid shit that didn't make me any money back

I can't imagine that just 2 months ago, hopeless, unwanted, unloved, abandoned and forgotten.  I want you to know that those are all LIES!  No matter how hard it is for you to believe, there is someone out there who cares about you.

SW has been a huge help in the past for me when I've struggled with depression.  I can't tell you how serious my suicidal thoughts and plans were. I was even ordering sedatives over the internet that I could overdose on.  I don't know any of you

I know you think that no one out there cares about you or would even miss you if you left.  I have had those exact same feelings.  I constantly would tell myself, that ***I*** care about you.  ***I*** want to see you succeed and be happy.  It pains me so much to see people feeling this degree of pain, having experienced it myself.

I want to give you some advice that helped me get through it!

You have to learn to recognize intrusive thoughts.  Recognize them as **LIES** and rebuke them immediately.  Do not entertain those thoughts for even a split second.  If you let your mind go off on its own

Secondly, ""You could just die and nobody would notice or care.""  This mindset drove a lot of my suicidal behavior.  I realized that I was putting my worth and happiness in the hands of *other* people.  Who gives a SHIT what Joe Schmoe, your old high school buddy, thinks of you?!  If he/she doesn't care about you, then why should you care about them?  Your life's value is what ***YOU*** make of it.

Everyone has their vice.  Mine was drugs.  You CANNOT let drugs take control of your life.  I know it's scary to face the world on your own, but you **MUST** tell yourself that the drugs are running your life, and that it is absolutely necessary to get rid of them.  Don't even look at it as a decision.  Look at it as an inevitability.  How many times have you heard someone say that drugs did great things for their life?  You're going to have to give up the drugs at some point to have a successful, fulfilling life. Why not start now?  I can tell you that since I stopped using hallucinogens, I feel better than I've felt in YEARS.  There is NO better feeling than getting everything done off your to-do list and then relaxing.

**STAY BUSY!**

I can't stress that enough.  There is so much truth in the saying ""Idle hands are the Devil's tools.""  Here's some ideas to keep you busy during the day:

* Get in shape
* Learn a new language
* Go Kayaking
* Go hiking/camping
* Collect something
* Volunteer somewhere
* Take an online course (or go to khanacademy.org and learn something new for free)
* Learn a programming language and make an app for your computer or smartphone (there's tons of books and online materials)
* Make a blog
* Learn a musical instrument
* Join a local community (Could be a church, a movie club, etc.)
* Go to yard sales and thrift stores
* Watch a documentary or a movie you wouldn't normally watch
* Write poetry or a short story or a song
* Do some puzzles
* Get organized

There's literally an endless number of things you can do to keep yourself busy no matter where you live. (comment if you want to add more ideas)

Also, and they have worked wonders for my sleep schedule.  They help settle your mind and fall asleep.

I also want to encourage you to seek help if you need it.  I was furious when I was taken to the hospital, if you are issued a TDO, you don't need insurance to go to the hospital.  Look online or ask a local counseling center about group counseling.  Your pain and suffering is nothing to be ashamed of.  Nobody is going to judge you in the groups, because chances are, someone in your group is worse off than you.  Don't hesitate to go to an Alc Anon, Narc Anon, etc.

I really hope that this post could offer some hope and encouragement to those of you out there that are suffering.  These are things that have helped me deal with my depression and suicidal tendencies.

What I did was ""brave"" and ""selfless"" and so no one expects that I regret it every day of my life. I was very subtly coerced, I have all the answers, that I am strong and capable. But I'm not. I am a shell of a person. I am a scared little girl, all alone. I am needy and helpless and vulnerable and I have never been allowed to be those things even for a second. I have swept the pain under the rug for so long.

I find myself at a place in my life, just work, 14 hour days. My roommates hate me and my dog. My boyfriend is pulling away because my complexities aren't as exciting as he once thought, because he doesn't want to listen to me ramble about the past. My mother is more concerned with ingratiating herself with her boyfriends three kids than how I'm doing. I need to move home but I can't because his daughter lives with them now. My dog is the same age as my son, I got him while I was pregnant. People thought it was a bad idea because getting a ""replacement"" wasn't healthy but at this point my dog is the only thing keeping me alive. I couldn't leave him with people who don't care about him. My dog needs me. But I don't know how long I can keep it up.

I am a shell. I have zero personality at this point. I am so exhausted with trying to put up these fronts that I am okay. I have never been allowed to feel pain, and I see no reason to wait around any longer for relief. I have been to several therapists, and all they can muster is a blank stare and a lecture on ""ambiguous loss"" because ya know, ""it's the same thing families of POW's go through.""

Might it not be best to anaesthetize it, to deaden it, to destroy it, to not have to live with the pain of struggling towards it and trying to keep it pure.

Through my teenage years, singled out, and lonely. Many of my high school class mates never took the time to get to know me, I thought it was something with my personality, and maybe it was, maybe I alienated myself. The one thing that always kept me going was my dream of one day helping others, I wanted to be a doctor. I worked my ass off, and got into an elite university. Again

People came to know me
Through all of this depression and loneliness, but more importantly, something that worked for me. I eventually came to a conclusion, there is no secret, life is what you make of it. I started therapy and eventually worked out my issues.

Fast forward to a few years ago, I knew what this entailed. I kept working through chemo and luckily it was an operable tumor. The idea of my own mortality struck me as something very profound. I had a growth in my head that could do for me what I had so greatly desired as a youth; death. Oddly, when faced with this, I had the strongest desire to live. I noticed the beauty in every day life, I love the smell of flowers, I love to look at the stars. I am an atheist, so don't feel like I am making a faith based message here.

What I realized, and how lucky I am to have won the universal lottery. I know many of you see the world as bleak and empty, are hopeless and alone, but you are not. Please, if you feel as though you really cannot take it, get professional help, these are my experiences only. Maybe, maybe not, get help if needed. You never know when someone may need YOUR help!

Hillman suggests that the psychiatrist might be wiser to walk with the suicide to the lip of the abyss and stare down into it with him/her.  We still don't want the person to jump

He's just talking about psychiatrists, good times being just around the corner.

In a way it is better to be a real friend

Some people, are involved in a dance with death. In a sense, they have already lived their lives -- intensely, often miserably. 

This accounts for a small percentage of those of us with suicidal urges. I'm talking the hard core -- the death's head kids. Daniele was such. When she died there were literally over a hundred plastic and ceramic skulls surrounding her.

Could she be saved? She was saved

What is the lesson of a kid like that? That suicide is very profound, to respect one another, so that when we do die, we aren't entirely by ourselves.

In the past weeks, because I had no insurance at the time, I'm now $30,000 in debt for a 4 day hospital visit.

I've been home for over a month with no job prospects. My family gets more aggravated with me every day because I'm not working. I'm afraid to tell them about my HIV status for fear they might reject me and kick me out again... after which I have no other place to go.

In addition

I never wanted to live my life alone, and knows I'm HIV+ runs. 

I take my HIV pills every day to keep me alive

I don't have money to go back to school

The idea of suicide being selfish has no effect on me. After the help I've asked for and been denied because it was too much of an inconvenience for others... it has caused me so much pain and grief.

I'm back home now and it's driving me fucking insane. My mother is a raging alcoholic who hasn't contributed to society in the slightest in years and who talks down to everyone constantly and my father is a spineless wuss who never stands up to anyone.

It doesn't help that finding a job is for some reason fucking impossible and that I failed a personal trainer certification due to being so frazzled all the time at home and not being able to focus. I feel fucking unfocused all the time here. All I hear is that bitch and her fucking screaming and her taunts. Every god damn day.

Well, being dead and all. I've always sort of had this desire to commit suicide, but it wasn't practical then. I have the resources now to accomplish it, where I hadn't before. I had an acquaintance in my home state who had committed suicide. We had a few courses together, I talked to him casually, never really hung out with him. But it was still interesting, knowing someone who had willfully killed himself. What were his last thoughts? What drove him to do that? I saw how his friends reacted to his death, it was incredible. Knowing that I don't have that kind of impact is disheartening

I know my parents and siblings would be very saddened about hearing of my death, being close to me near the end.

The **tl;dr** version: I tried to commit suicide (with pills), but I know now that suicide isn't the answer.

On to the story...

A bit of background on me: If you labeled me a loner, which led me to believe that I was somehow broken because I wasn't as social as they were. My self-esteem was nearly non-existent as a teenager. Thought I was ugly. My ""friends"" only used me at their convenience. Struggled with my sexuality. Had a lot of guilt laid on me because of my religious environment. 

As I grew up

Then, that said my life was meaningless, that I had no reason to live. It told me that everyone would be better off without me so why bother staying? No one really cared, right? They just pretend to. They love you because they have to. 

And I believed it. I slid down the hill faster and faster

The idea that appealed to me the most was sleeping pills. So I gathered as much as I could. I took them out several nights, one night, it was just too much. Life had reached the point where it meant nothing to me at all.

So I brought out those pills, in my darkened cave, hopeless and lost and in miserable pain? No. I didn't want that. I couldn't go through with it. 

I tried to throw up the pills

I went and told my parents what I'd tried to do the night before and they called an ambulance and got me to the hospital. I recovered quickly and my family did their best not to make too much of a fuss over it

Life is still hard for me. I have some trials that I haven't shared because I'm not comfortable doing so

She started to get depressed about a year ago because of a guy that broke up with her for his ex.  She was so tore up inside, long brown hair, a gorgeous smile, and a one of a kind personality. I finally convinced her to get help, whether that be counseling, medicine, anything.  She started to feel better

About a year passes and during that year we had some rough times

Over this past weekend, we both are so stubborn.  I won't say the first word but my mind is screaming at me to, and of course, Chloe was the exact same way.  That Tuesday night we had text about the fight, with her saying she was miserable and she felt like her soul was empty.  She suggested I find a new best friend.  I replied back telling her how fucking amazing she is and had no reason to be so hard on herself. 

On Wednesday when I got home from class

It wasn't until Thursday afternoon did I go in her room.  The only reason I had the balls to do it is because that morning I put my ear up to the door to here what song was playing.  When I got back from class around 2PM, but when I saw the mess by her feet, I knew she wasn't standing. I said her name one more time and she didn't answer me.  I walked up to her and looked at her face. I knew it, I just had to make sure. She had used her dogs choke leash and hung herself from her ceiling fan.  

My beautiful, see, smell, eat reminds me of her.  I'm still in shock and haven't realized that I will never be able to touch, laugh with, snuggle, or even see my best friend again. 

I wish I would have told her every single day how much she meant to me and how I would suffer without her.  I have so many unanswered questions that I will never know the answer to.  

I can't imagine the battle she was going though in her head.  Who even knows if she's not hurting anymore or where she is now.. I hope on everything she is happy though.  

For all of you lovely individuals who are suffering like my Chloe, or just experience life.  I now have to experience life without her and I would give ANYTHING to get her back. Think of everyone who loves you and how you are forcing them to only have memories and pictures left if you were no longer here.  Every second I miss Chloe more and more.

1286896293.0,dq7ww,Checklist of common sense. Don't do it!,Thermidor2,34,9,5,"I didn't know this reddit existed. I'm both glad and sad that it does. I just want to say my piece. It might help. It might not. But I have a few things to get off my chest that I wish I could have said to a couple of people I have known along the way. It’s a bit disjointed

Firstly, clappy Anthony Robbins type that is going to ram ""life is wonderful"" at you. Life often sucks, and the world is full of crappy people. Bummer! But there are two sides to every coin.

In my opinion, or it is something that you fear will happen soon – maybe a secret that you have held inside for a long time, or something you have done that you need to confess to the world.

You believe that you will never feel happy and contented like other people. You feel different. Isolated. Nobody understands. Maybe you have tried to talk to someone, other people won’t understand your decision, but they don’t have all the facts. They can’t see the situation like you see it. If they were inside your life, they’d do it too. You’re right – and you’re wrong.

I'm not here to tell you that it ""is"" or that it ""isn't"" the right decision - it's your life. But you have to take a “time out” to think. Really think. Not worry. Not focus on one problem. But THINK - about your whole life and your whole existence. That is what is at stake here.

If you have a headache, you don't think about killing yourself - because you know it will go away. You don’t focus on the “now”, you focus on “later”. It is this hope, this faith in a headache-free future, that comforts you.

It is the opposite of this, and a clouded vision of the future, that leads to the most destructive personal decision a human being can take.

I'd just like to say to anyone that finds themselves in this position. Stop and think. You can't? Your mind is made up? . . . . So what do you have to lose by thinking for a while then? There’s no rush. After all

1) The world is full of people who tried and failed to commit suicide, and see with hindsight how wrong they were. By definition, every person who has long-term survived a suicide attempt is a testimony to that fact that life can and usually does improve.

2) Often you can get so depressed and concerned over a single issue or set of issues, and focus on what is wrong. There are no “possibilities” - just the problems of today. The same cycle of thought. Over and over again. It's like being stuck on a rollercoaster. 

You wake up in a morning

You don’t think that this applies to you? Well just think. Think about before these thoughts took over your life. Think about the way you used to live, playing video games, reading, bowling. Just think about something that USED to make you happy . . . . . . How long is it since you thought about those things? How long is it since you did them? When did you last plan to do them again? 

Don’t you see – this frame of mind you are in, stolen it, and are stopping you from seeing or experiencing the good things in life. It’s a monster, and it’s not your friend – it is your enemy You need to fight it. You need to win. You CAN have the happiness back. Be angry if you like. Something is stealing your happiness – and you have to defeat it!

3) If you are feeling bad about yourself

I've been to a funeral of someone who took their own life. Was it full of people saying that the person was nasty and boring? Full of people saying “OK – See ya”. No. It was a room full of people saying the nicest things about a wonderful person. People all wishing that they could turn back the clock and say those things to the guy in the casket a few weeks before. Help him.

Think about how many people in your life you like, and then let our true feelings flood out when it’s too late. 

So think about someone you find special


4) If you are feeling bad about an issue or a situation in your life, friends, social status. But consider two things.

First – how much of a relief will it be when you can finally get everything out into the open. No secrets. Nothing hidden. No constant thoughts of “What will happen if . . .”. It’s done. Phew!

Secondly – everything material you lose can be replaced. Money. Possessions. They just come and go – and they are not the things that really make you happy. If you lose friends – they were not really friends anyway – and you’ll be surprised just how loyal friends can be. Plus – when you finally get your head sorted out

4) My final thought is this. The world

Finding yourself on the floor, and you have nothing to lose. The only way is up, and you can afford to take radical decisions. Yes – this is a life changing moment for you. A fork in the road. But it is a FORK with two paths. Right now you have been hanging around at the junction – probably for a long time, staring down the “death fork”, but shift your focus.

Basically

I remember George Carlin saying that ""luck is genetics as well as the desire to do hard work"", can't attract women (due to me having the face of a rapist) and on the rare alcohol-fuelled occassions I do I have no idea what to do with them once I've got them. I have no idea how to be charming or charismatic in a conversation and it makes me really upset when I see that people would rather hang out with someone else despite them talking a load of bullshit.

I could accept not being a gregarious person if I had formidable mental capabilties to compensate for it but I don't have those. I have zero imagination

So as it is, no idea what I want to do with my life, no luck, no drive, nothing to give me enjoyment, no past, no present and by the looks of it no future. I think my genetics and my mental conditioning up this point are pretty much made up for life now so this is my lot

I'm a 20 year-old male. These thoughts began when I was 13

My parents separated when I was 7. It was for the best, and that meant working herself to exhaustion. She was ruined by her situation, while my father (made of money) complained openly about child support to her, my sister and I (and does to this day). I recently found out he even attempted to sue her at the time of their split. We moved away when I was 10, and everything continued.

I began to encounter my own problems (of which there are plenty) at high school and ended up hating myself at age 13. I create a lot

I did two years of university. The first year was in some ways pretty good. I moved out of home (a new home: my mum re-married and is raising my sister in a nice environment - I couldn't be more pleased for them) and into a place with friends. I got steady As and a letter of recommendation. I felt really proud for a little while. But it got to the point where I had a panic attack every time I had to talk in a tutorial and eventually whenever I left the house. I decided to take this year off studying to spend time creating

1265226628.0,axp74,A weird dream changed my life,cordwire,30,3,6,"Just thought I'd share this with you. I'm a 23 year old male and I've felt like killing myself for years now.  I let myself go down this downward spiral and ended up as a stereotypical parents' basement dweller after withdrawing from my university when I was put on academic probation.

As time went on, I would just fall back to my old self after a few days. Life was only getting worse, and my prospects weren't looking good. I was being a leech to society and life seemed pointless. 

Fast forward a couple of months of this horrible existence, but here goes: 

&lt;CRAZY DREAM&gt; I'm in this giant facility for 'useless people' and a bunch of 'government scientist' types are messing around with me and putting me through a series of tests and trials. 

They then make me put on a mask and tell me to get into this large elevator with a mirror in it. I comply but I feel something's wrong about this whole thing. Soon enough they say ""Goodbye"" and start laughing at me through a window in the door and the elevator starts going down. I'm overcome with fear as I realize I'm going to die and start freaking out, I can't be useless, I'm still alive"". I pull out my phone to call for help, only to find out there's no network coverage since I'm underground and in an elevator. I then decide to record a message for others in case they find my body later. 

I start recording a video and begin this long epitaph in which I speak to the people close to me, I felt great from that moment on. 

This post is getting too long so in short, I find more reasons to live instead of dying.  It's strange a dream brought out the best in me, I guess a lot depends on how you look at things. To those feeling down, I hope life turns out better for you.

Attempts to find more work have all led to disappointment and failure. Because I'm a single male with no kids and a job that is reported to the state as only 4 hours a week, and closing the studio down is a real possibility that would just emphasize how much I have failed, plus giving me no place but the outside to deal with.

It would be weeks before anyone would know if I were able to carry it out tonight. Students would just think I was sick or on vacation. The college would fire me after I missed class twice in a row without letting them know--but they'd do it through email

All I have now is venting to places like MMFB and here, one doesn't even deserve the mask. Life and society would objectively be better off without me.

That last sentence was really egotistical of me: 99.9999996% of the world won't even know or care that I'm gone. Their lives are not made better and only negligibly made worse by me existing.

I don't even know now why I wrote all of this. Maybe it's hoping that someone cares or even at least pretends to care for a few moments. Or maybe it was just me making things more definite and concrete. I'm not even sure if it matters anymore. I'm just overwhelmed and have nowhere to turn

I've decided that instead

Now

I'm rather quick to judge ""I cheated and now I'm sad"" as, ""I'm sorry"" and ""it gets better"" as ignorance. You don't know how I feel, as I've never told you. Those I've even started to go down the path of how I feel with, find my entire inner workings strange and alien. If you're sorry, you wouldn't do what you do. If the situation has nothing to do with anything you did, you can't be too sorry about it. I'd assume that we as humans are in a constant state of feeling empathy for those in less fortunate circumstances, we're all sorry in this regard 24/7. It gets better? No

As you can see

Essentially, events and troubles that have caused me to end up where I am, bothering to type this. But for the majority of my life I haven't wanted to live, I've often found ways to ignore that and carry on, as I know that while my mother, father, would be better off without me in their life - they wouldn't deal well with me dying. This has led me to be rather distant from them, I actually am really unhappy with them for making me be alive.

My major coping mechanism to carry on in life has been to attempt to help/benefit/fix others, as they have other people in their lives now to do that.

Unfortunately this leads me with nothing to forget the issues I have myself and so I've been considering whether suicide is a legitimate option for me.

When I was 8 I said things would be better when I was 11, I thought things would be better when I was 20, they weren't and so the cycle has continued throughout my life.

I'd like to go to my mother and father and offer up a conversation to each of them

So here I am, unhappy and bored of being here.

I think I need the opportunity to list through all the things that have caused me hassle and have my opinions on it either confirmed or not. I've spent my life knowing what people were going to do before they do it, its always been brushed off as coincidence or that I had not even said anything.

I need some grounding and I'd like to work out whether suicide is an appropriate path.

Yes

My life is pretty shitty at the moment. Today I really felt like that my life is absolutely worthless and not worth living. I thought hard about it and I'm getting afraid that it won't get better. Maybe this will sound melodramatic but that's how I feel.

I'm doing terrible at school and I'm not getting any student loans because I haven't finished enough studies. I can't seem to have a normal conversation without coming of as a fucking inconsiderate douche. I'm really starting to wonder if I'm an extremely uncomfortable person to be around. I have pretty shitty sleep schedule and I'm pretty tired at the moment (I couldn't sleep but I'm going to take a nap after I finished this post). My knee is damaged because of faulty training

I suspect I have ADHD and I've tried to seek help for it. But it takes a long time and I will get help in about 2-3 months. Today I just wanted to curl in my bed and die. I talked to them and they said that there is no chance to hasten the process.

I've tried to call a few suicide/urgency-hotlines but they've all been busy or the line wasn't open at that moment. I don't think I'll really kill myself. The thought of my family living with that is horrible to me and I just can't do that to them.

I've tried commiting sucide back when I was a teenger but I failed. I don't think I will do it now but today I just really wanted to die.

I talked to a nurse and he suggested that I should go to acute psychiatric ward (I don't know what it's called in english

The first part of this post is gonna be my story

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Part I - My story.

I've been contemplating suicide since I was 14. I'm 24 now. Why? I'll try to put it in a chronological order.

The first reason is probably because I grew up in a broken home in a a third-world country where divorce is frowned upon. Rich but crazy violent/abusive father

The second reason is that I'm always quite the out-of-place geek. I have an outlier IQ. For anybody who thinks that is a gift, you are always the outcast.

The third is that I am unemployed and have pretty much zero cash. I have a finance degree from a US university but seem to have zero luck finding a job.

The fourth is I almost got married and pretty much failed. Had a blast, and she has recovered well since, but those days were depressing and it got the worst of me, it stressed me out so much, I don't do well under that much stress. I got angry a lot, and I vent it on the nearest people. And sadly she's the closest so she got the most of it. Our relationship had gotten downhill since that time. Instead of always saying ""I love you"" everyday now she's always like ""you wanna take a break? we'll still be friends"".

Fifth reason is I started my own herpetology business, literal blood sweat and tears yada yada, and still failed miserably. Now I'm in the process of selling everything at a loss. A loss of time, effort, happiness, hope, and dream.

It would probably be better if it were any other business. But with animals

That's pretty much it. I have been depressed as all hell this past few years, and that is the word this subreddit is centered upon: suicide.

But as I live my day-to-day currently bumming life I realize

I really don't want to die. But I have no money, I'm losing my fiancee, and I just cut ties to my family.

But I still have another idea. Another plan

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Part II - My idea.

There are probably thousands of suicidal people reading this subreddit. Thousands of people in similar situations, ready to pop at any moment.

Let's fucking change that. We are not alone. We can help each other.

What I propose is we build a community. Whenever you are already on the very edge and ready to pop that xanax or click that gun trigger, having the adventure of our life. A lot of us. We've got nothing to lose, you were about to end your life anyway. If you dont like it after, then feel free to commit whatever it is you wanna commit after this. But just give this plan a chance.

What is the plan? Well

I am sure we all come from different backgrounds.

Some of us may be a good linguist and can make learning the new language a bit easier for the rest of us.

Some of us may know computers and technologies a lot and make understanding the foreign tech stuffs easier for all of us.

Some of us may be extremely good at making new friends at this new place and connecting the rest of us.

Some of us may have great entrepreneurial spirits and can help us find a job or start a new biz in the new place.

Some of us may be awesome in mediating the group together

Some of us may be great leaders who can motivate people on hard times.

Some of us may be hilarious jokers who will brighten everyone's day.

My point is, even if we dont know crap about a particular thing, having more people there is gonna be way more fun than doing things alone.

No matter what your situation is, or lesbian? Welcome to the party! You're poor as sin? Me too! You're alone? Not anymore! You have no friends, or just broke up? There's a ton of new people here to hook up with!

Let's do this. Let's move somewhere new, Russia, Taiwan, Antarctica, whereever. Lets embrace a completely new life. Build a new community together. Fuck the past. Live in the present. Be surprised at the future.

I think it completely beats pulling the trigger.

I guess I should start from the beginning. I got really sick a long time ago. Brain damage, my life has been a downward spiral. I get told how proud people are of me that I pushed forward. That I made it. And that I even graduated from high school even though I didn't think I could do it. Not when you have to relearn the basic concepts of kindergarten at 14. But I did. Shortly before graduation, my body began collapsing. Soon, I would crumple at various times throughout the day. Another diagnosis. Fuck. I went college. It took me six years, a serious drug problem, and a host of doctors visits, but I did it. I graduated. Another fucking tick mark. 

I left my family after graduation. I couldn't take the disappointment. I knew that if I stayed, and began a ""new life."" I got a job. I told myself all I wanted to do was change the world. Everything is fucked and if I don't stand up and try to fix it, then I'll consider myself a failure. I found a shitty apartment. My partner had to have his parents cosign on his side of the lease because his credit is piss poor. I told myself I had made it. That this was stability. A job. A roof. Some ramen. I tried so hard to be happy. To stick to my ethos.

You see, a poor employee, and about to be fired. All because basic things like punctuality, time management, and communication get put aside just to do the basic tasks of the job. I lost my job on Tuesday. We have 1000 dollars in savings. I thought we'd be okay until I could find another job. 

I got a call on Wednesday. It was a collector. I had a fender bender with a coworker a long time ago. He ran into me

100 dollars in an economy with a high unemployment rate. Recent grad, let alone get to it. 100 dollars. What about rent and bills? I haven't been eating already. I'm already hungry because we're broke. Wake up hungry. Go to sleep hungry. Repeat ad nauseam.  

We have a 1000 dollars. That's enough to cover my partner cancelling the lease after I'm dead so they don't go after his parents. My body's already broken. I'm already a failure. I don't have any more options. This saves my partner and his parents from failure to pay bills. This'll get him back to his folks until he can find another place to stay. He'll have food and shelter and won't be facing what we're facing right now.

It was in the last few moments though, I dunno how much time had passed.  The branch I had tied the cord around had broken.  I guess that final struggle worked to my favor?  I haven't really thought about it.

I lay there in the woods for a while, it wasn't easy, it wasn't painless.  It fucking hurt, a lot.  I thought to myself, if I wanted to die I wouldn't be debating it now, and I wouldn't have struggled in the end right?

I came back home, or any sort of center for this kind of thing.  Part of the reason I was miserable, I suppose.  I went over to a close friends house, told her what happened, and just sat there for a while.

My phone kept ringing, and I was not given any time to process the events before I had to start processing how I made other people feel.  I spent the majority of the first 2 days on the phone, assuring various relatives and friends that I was OK.  That they could stop worrying now, thanks, go back to your lives.

I wake up in the mornings, which is pretty normal.  My neck and throat are sore, and eating was a challenge the first couple of days.  Nothing I can do but wait for it to heal.  I feel as if it's a reminder, every time I look at the mirror I see the bruises on my neck.  My blood-red eyes.  I am just ashamed at myself.
I am trying to deal with it one day at a time.  It gets a little better.  The pain I had before is still there
I got lucky.  Not everyone does.  Seeing how I affected the people around me with just an attempt really put things in perspective for me.

The hardest part for me is just talking to people about it.  Unless you have tried it or have at least considered it as an option

This is normal. No amount of material assets have ever made anyone happy. You can be happy with barely enough to eat if you have people who love you around you, you have every right to feel miserable.

Well, and helpful. He went out with another officer who had military experience so he could make a bond with my friend while they spoke.

At age 17: I was making roughly $800 bi-weekly doing web development at a firm.

At age 18: I was making roughly $900 bi-weekly doing web/desktop development at a firm.

At age 17: I had a beautiful girlfriend that I provided everything I could to. We lost our virginities to each other. I would spend time

At age 18: She left me for a friend and from my knowledge has started doing everything we had agreed was not good. (smoking cigarettes

--

At age 17: I never had enough money to live on my own

At age 18: Same as above.

--

I'm turning 19 this weekend.

I quit my $900 job after my girlfriend left me.

I failed a class and did poorly in another. (After having been on Dean's list

My ex is out fucking whoever she wants.

I'm tired of being the one who has to kill himself to get anything back.

I quit my job because I hated it. I wanted to be happy

I fucked up school because I was trying to spend more time with my ""friends."" They only had time for me at odd hours

I'm deprived of real good friends.

One of my current ""friends"" owes me well over $300.

My only real friend in life was my ex.

I no longer care for her. I hope she somehow ends up in the same state I'm in. Terrible, hate. I hate everything.

I can't ever enjoy myself; almost as if I'm not meant to be able to.

I have brief moments where I'm happy

By hanging out with my ""friends"" I'm fucking up the now-no-longer-existent relationship with my parents.

I started smoking weed... a lot.

It's been therapeutic. I get things done. I actually enjoy many things I do because I can't possibly think about the depressing things in my life and be focussed on what's going on in front of me.

But

I started my own company. I have 3 or 4 major clients.

No income after a month.

I've been surviving (secretly) off a $2, but that's the least of my worries. I owe loan companies my life right now thanks to school! *thumbs up for trying to get a degree!*)

Degrees are a waste of fucking money.

No one has cared about any of my accomplishments and won't even look at me with the same respect because of my age.

I'm tired of it.

I'm a hacker. It sounds corny

I hack things. I break into things because it's like a puzzle. I enjoy doing it.

It's the one thing I can do and prove to others that they aren't any better than I am.

I've never done anything illegal

I don't *want* to do anything illegal.

But what is right? How do you know that this is what's right? Would there be a right if there was no wrong? Would you feel hate if you knew nothing of love? 

If you were never shown any love

So there is love, and hope lives in all existence no matter how many people are blind to it, no matter how many people deny it or even hate it. Even if you've spent years hating it, it's still there. Hope lives unconditionally in all existence. There will be true companionship and lovely laughter. There will be fresh excitement and peaceful content. And it's all beautiful. And it's all worth it. It will come, so don't run, don't be scared and don't reject it. ",,,,

My grades are good, and I can socialize decently.

But why do I feel like killing myself every time I leave school?

I hate my life so much. The only things I can be proud about are my grades and my gaming skills. My friends don't really know me, my dreams, my ambitions.

I'm feeling angry now
I sure as fuck don't want to talk about this to my parents. They're not that bad I think, internet, cable, eat every day three times. But i fucking hate them so much. That fucking sperm donor who calls himself a father isnt fucking one. In second grade i teased my sister with friends, a shitty move, but I dont think I deserved to get thrashed the way I did?

Maybe I did
(wasn't even that bad though right? not even a black eye or any bruises)
I can barely type

When I was in fourth grade my father thrashed me again for getting an 88 on a social studies test, i should have studied harder instead of playing my new PS2, ratchet and clank is always fun.

But it wasnt that bad he didn't hit me too hard.

In 6th grade or 7th grade i didnt want to do my kumon and he almost strangled me because I said no

He doesnt do it really that much anymore

Its always my fault in my family

I'm so fucking pathetic

I don't want to though

Or maybe im a fucking drama queen.

I feel like I'm blowing things out of proportion and just overreacting.
EDIT:

Now that I've calmed down a bit, small mouse infestation but nothing too bad. I can actually emphasize with my parents a bit. They grew up in the Phillippines, in poor conditions, so maybe its just the way they're used to acting. My parents are under a lot of stress too, high bills and all, plus the fact that my father can't really do anything, because of personal pride and age.

He was a lawyer in the Phillippines, acting as a stay at home dad while still keeping up the appearances of a ""retired attorney"". It must be a lot of shame and stress that hes feeling.

I know that this doesn't excuse their actions. The misspellings, and I want to let it go. I can't change my parents- I need them, not ready to break away just yet. But the instant I'm leaving the house, thats it. No more contact.

There are so many smarter or more experienced people getting jobs that I am never gonna get a real career job.
I am so sick of feeling like shit all the time. All the people around me say ""it will get better"" but it's just been going downhill for years and not looking up at all. I am sick of seeing everyone else around me successful or in good relationships and me with a broken family because of my brother committing suicide 7 years ago and all my ""friends"" only give a crap about me when I am to the point of being suicidal and then once that's gone they go back to their happy lives and leave me in the dust.

I made [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/byawi/please_someone_listen_to_me_i_feel_completely/) post a couple of weeks ago

I'd first like to thank the people here in SW, feeling like a beaten dog with no-one to turn to. It was *you* that stopped me from doing something stupid. I remember I was ogling a bottle of Vodka at the time, which seemed like the solution to what I was facing. I just wanted to be gone, and to be disattatched from the horrible feelings I had. If I would've drunk that bottle I'd either would've had alcohol poisoning and no-one to help me with, or would've thrown myself off something. It was you that gave me someone to turn to, someone to talk about everything and even someone to confide into. This goes for all the people who responded to the topic, and who PM'd me. So, thank you. 

If you want to know what the after story is: I went to the train station to buy myself a ticket home. I had turned my cell off for some reason. When I came back home he was in front of my door. As soon as I saw him, and he leaned down and hugged me. As soon as he touched me, I felt contempt. I pushed him away, got up, and told him that he had broken us and that nothing was ever going to be the same. I opened my door and slammed it shut. The next day I was off on a 9 hour train ride. My family didn't know why I had come, so I just engaged in some routine actions, to keep myself busy. Being away from it all gave me a long time to think, I sent him a single text message: ""I miss you"". I was angry that he hadn't tried to contact me, telling me that he was sorry. 

So I decided to give him a second chance. I saw him again for the first time yesterday. Things are different. They are awkward. I don't think we'll be a couple again

For the past few months, I now have prescribed narcotics (my last refill). I've been seriously tempted to overdose on them twice so far. It was relaxing to count the number of  pills over and over again. The other times I take them to sleep. The low point was last winter, when a student at my school committed suicide. I was scared because that could have been me. I tell myself I would never do this to my family and friends. I would never hurt them or make them cry. But I really fear that in the future, in a moment of weakness and selfishness, I am capable of forgetting the people who care. 

How is it that my emotions can change so quickly? I can go from smiling and happiness to feelings of suicide and depression in an instant. When I am around my friends, I feel like shit. I am unhappy with myself and no longer think I can change. I don't want to bother trying anymore because I know I will fail again someday. Right before this, I came up with plans to change but who the fuck am I kidding? Its not going to work as I've already failed  today. 

I am a terrible student with no motivation. I don't deserve to be in the university I am right now. I cheated my way through high school. I lie to my parents about my grades. I tell my parents I am going to law school just so they don't worry. I lie to my parents who are devout Christians about going to church every Sunday. I've become agnostic since the last two years. I don't want to disappoint them. My dad immigrated over 20 years ago and works a tough job to support me even in his old age. I think my brother molested me when I was younger

I've been a sick pervert ever since middle school. Porn doesn't seem to be a big deal to everyone else on Reddit. I got caught masturbating by my roommate multiple times last year. I even did it many times at night when he was sleeping in the room. I feel sick for fantasizing with the women I interact with at school. I smile at them

I don't have social or people problems and I don't have a dysfunctional family. I don't have a sob story like others. I get depressed about my depression. I believe I really don't deserve to be depressed. I don't want to deal with my problems so I just play games all the time to distract myself.  I have access to university counseling but I don't think I could ever talk to a stranger face to face about these things. I am too ashamed.

**My problem**

I always get by in school doing things in the last minute. Every year, but I have become a real anti social-person at 20. Every boy and girl in my family has a boyfriend and girlfriend and friends that they go out with to party and get stress off of their minds (I have a large family). But all I have done the past 3 years is sit in my room, study and then waste time on the computer. I feel like a geniune loser in front of them all.

**My father**

The only thing that has kept me from hurting myself has been my father. My father has been the one person in my life that I cant imagine to die in front of. He has spent all his life dedicated to making every detail of my life the best it can be. He is a working class man, school debt, and Im probably going to fail this semester and work a dead end job because I have no connections or portfolios with anyone. I cant blame anyone for this, i dont even blame myself because I know that when i feel this bad i cant function properly to do anything right.
