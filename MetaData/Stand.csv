[CISPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyber_Intelligence_Sharing_and_Protection_Act)
is a bill that has just passed the House of Representitives and is [currently working its way through the Senate](http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr624).
If you don't remember this bill from [last year's blackout](http://blog.reddit.com/2012/05/cispa-and-cybersecurity-bills-are.html); you're in luck

In order to raise awareness for this legislation

**Okay

First of all

CISPA is a bill focused on Cyber Security. It's meant to address growing concerns for Cyber threats and give protection to businesses who handle your personal information. The number one threat to your personal information is malicious attackers

*So

(A) IN GENERAL- The term ‘cyber threat information’ means information directly pertaining to--

    (i) a vulnerability of a system or network of a government or private entity;

    (ii) a threat to the integrity, processed on, or transiting such a system or network;

    (iii) efforts to deny access to or degrade

    (iv) efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a government or private entity, or transiting a system or network of a government or private entity.

(B) EXCLUSION- Such term does not include information pertaining to efforts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network of a government or private entity that solely involve violations of consumer terms of service or consumer licensing agreements and do not otherwise constitute unauthorized access.

*Well that's well and dandy

While CISPA was written to address a legitimate problem

**I want to make a difference

[Contact your senators!](http://www.senate.gov/general/contact_information/senators_cfm.cfm)
Call them, send smoke signals! Whatever it takes! The more they hear from their constituents
the more they'll see how important the issue is to us. CISPA is very low salience among most people
important for us to get the word out the best we can. You *do* have a voice and it's time to make it heard.

I agree with the authors of the House bill that our nation faces a serious and growing threat from  cyber attacks and espionage—threats to both our national security and our economy.  Effective  cybersecurity requires that information on cyber threats and defenses in our government's hands be passed to the private sector
 
At the same time, and place proper limits on the government's use of cyber security information that it obtains from the private sector.

Like most here I am interested in subreddits turning to action when finding out things like the NSA leaks for example. With the exemption of witch hunts. 


The thing I want to share with this subreddit is around the time that conspiracy theorists were focused on the illegal war in iraq and the economic inequality (and unethical banking practice). A new 'hypothetical' idea came about.


The idea was to exploit 'common law' to claim sovereignty. (Turning around and refusing the rule of the country and claiming a new rule). This is vastly over simplified and the legal intricacies


This is why I think it's possible:


The media are a huge resourceful sector. Plenty of money and influence - in fact, then they tried to spread awareness. Then finally, they **replaced them**. The sheer amount of blogs, alternative news outlets, youtube channels and other community based media are replacing the powers of old - especially the the ones known to be least truthful. 


As technology and online communities give momentum to this media replacement


Essentially, and that's no small feat (A ex-CIA Director did a speech about the bloggers replacing media too). 


I'm not fully informed on this because I am absolved by other avenues at the moment but I thought if this post caught the eye of some people in the subreddit it might be useful.

I have created a primer that explains just about all of CISPA as well as I could explain it.  It's designed to be read alongside the actual bill (link to the bill in the posts).  It's a little long

Spread the word, but I have a pretty extensive mastery of legal-ese, as well as a penchant for word problems.  The 3 part series is pretty much designed for people that really want to see EVERYTHING in CISPA.

[Part 1 - Section 1 and 2](http://redd.it/1ctycc).

[Part 2 - Section 3 - (a) through (c)](http://redd.it/1cykk6).

[Part 3 - Section 3 - (d) through Section 7](http://redd.it/1cyo8o).

For a short and sweet ELI5-version of CISPA...

CISPA creates a way for the US Government and companies like Facebook, to share that information among others that shouldn’t know (what WikiLeaks does), and allows for companies to trade personal information without getting in trouble.  It also allows for the US Government to spy on US citizens, to prosecute people that pirate movies, games or music, and does all of this without telling you.  You will also never know it’s happening.

The extreme version is people violating CISPA can be labeled ""domestic terrorists"" through a combination of CISPA and the Patriot Act

Many companies (nearly all that support CISPA, and everyone from internet providers to social networking sites will make money from the trading of information.  This is why there are so few companies fighting CISPA, and more reason for us citizens to protect our freedoms and liberties from ""Big Brother.""",,False,,t5_2u479,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cyq6w/cispa_hr_624_explained/

So what then, the country that we live in is on a path to becoming an Owellian nightmare, my greatest fear, indeed all of ours is that government overreach and paranoia will eventually end in a police state, it is our jobs as American citizens to ensure that this does not happen, obviously there are the [regular channels] (http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1g9gz0/i_am_james_bamford_one_of_the_journalists/cai3jrx) readily available for use, but I don't see how that can have the rate of impact required in a situation like this, when the current political climate is so dictated by party loyalty

I have seen this community, I'm a Highschool student, frustrated by the apathy of my peers and the clear damage to the system that is supposed to stand as a beacon to the world, I wish I could do more, but I have no grasp of the methods to do so, I don't have the oratory skill to rally people, nor would I know what to do if I did, we want to affect change

but that doesn't change the fact that the NSA and organizations like it are out of control, his department expanded, he plays on fear, he creates panic and then uses the chaos to expand his own power, even if he retires his successor has to be stopped, I guess my only real question is

Edit this to your liking but I think and others seem to think this is a really good starting point: 

&gt;Senator Pryor
&gt;
&gt;As one of your constituents I am writing you this in regards to the upcoming vote on CISPA. I was sorely disappointed to see that Rep. Crawford voted yes for this bill. I believe this bill is just as bad as SOPA if not worse. 
&gt;
&gt;I understand in this day and age our government has to protect its citizens however I strongly feel though that giving up our privacy and liberties to combat this is just wrong and in fact it is giving in to the terrorists. What better way could they win? They are defeating our liberties and freedom by scaring our representatives to support bills like this.
&gt;
&gt;I voted for you last election but if you support this bill I can assure you that you will not have my vote nor that of many of my friends at Arkansas State University. 
&gt;
&gt;Your younger generation of constituents do not agree with these draconian laws and as I understand CISPA it makes what happened to Aaron Swartz even worse and is a disgrace to us Americans.
&gt;
&gt;Again
&gt;
&gt;I look forward to hearing back from you
&gt;
&gt;Best Regards


Now obviously Senator Pryor is my Senator and Rep. Crawford I mentioned is my rep. Change this letter as you see fit and if you have one that's better please feel free to one up me on this! I'll happily take it. We need to stand together on this and if someone can write a better letter please do :)

It only took me about 1 minute and not much thinking to write this so I know some of you can do better but for those of you who don't want to write a whole new one out just edit the names and the part about Arkansas State University.

Good luck guys! 

Edit 1: Try to personalize this a bit. We do not want to look like drones.

Edit 2: People are now posting their own versions of letters in the comments. Please take a look at all and find one that fits you best to send to your Senators. Also make sure you check to see if your rep's from the house voted yes to CISPA and kindly write them an email like I did (i posted mine in the comment section)",,t5_2u479,1366679596.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Stand/comments/1cw1jo/a_template_to_protest_cispa_to_your_senators/

My question is: what form of CISPA would you guys *want* to have pass? People worry that internet laws are written by those who don't really understand the internet and how it works so they can't fully understand the effects and implications of the bills they are proposing. 

But we can, diverse talent pool that I imagine one of us could write a version of CISPA that we could all agree on. 

We could write a version without ambiguous language, show scenarios in which the bill (as it is currently written) is twisted and abused whereas in the same situation our version is not susceptible. 

What will this accomplish? Probably nothing. At best, and incorporate positive changes. At worst, we've wasted time on reddit, which is what most of us are doing anyway.
