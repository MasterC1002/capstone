Being a part of this budding community has been an amazing experience. Now, all of this year's biggest titles are out now.

 * garbage collection hitches haven't been an issue
 * font systems are built in (using their 2D engine API) - no digging up someone else's bitmap font code

At the beginning of January, including some lovely comments [right here](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/169hu5/my_and_my_brothers_game_haunt_the_house/)!

I've found myself with a lot more spare promo codes than I thought I'd have, just comment here! 24 hours after I post this, I'll run the thread through redditraffle.com and pick 5 winners. Then 5 more each on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Winners can't win again though. [/r/RandomActsOfGaming](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfGaming/) rules suggest to only accept accounts over a month old, so I'm going with that as a rule too. If you don't want to enter but want to comment, just include the word ""nowin"" in your comment.

Also

You should be aware that while the game works on the Vita, United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Australia and Japan. If you don't have a PSN account from one of those countries, sorry! Here's hoping Sony will open it up to more countries soon...

Good luck!

After starting the night with the awards which included some free wine and a drinking game myself and some other Sound Shapes members started playing called 'drink when Journey wins an award' we discussed grabbing a cab to the party that Shaw-Han (robot and proud) was playing afterwards.  I jumped inside to take a bit of a pee and when I got back out to the group we were instantly grabbed by Renaud Bedard and Phil Fish and their significant others and ushered into a limo because... why not?  You don't need to win to arrive in style!

I met so many people yesterday and, the product marketr from Sony that bakes all the awesome game themed cakes](https://twitter.com/sak225#)!

Shaw-han's set was incredibly rad with some crazy generative visualizations he's been working on.  Philippe Lemarchand rocked it so hard (Phil Fish and Richard Lemarchand's stage name).

Basically I just wanted to say I had the most incredible feeling last night of vindication for my craft and the first thing I thought was ""I should thank everyone on reddit because they have been super supportive"".

This isn't from Sony or Queasy but just a random dude who makes games that happens to lurk reddit now and then and is blown away that work he's done has landed him in such amazing places with crazy cool people.

THANK YOU!

##Share your custom Vita wallpapers here.

Things to consider when making wallpapers:

* Scaling of .jpg images works fine but .png images need to be the proper resolution.

* Vita game screenshots make good wallpapers.

* Tiered sets like [HorizonShadow's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/q3i8b/i_made_a_tomb_raider_wallpaper_set_for_you_guys/) work quite well on the Vita. ([tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqgZlqLAbQ8))

* The resolution for the Vita is 960 x 544.

* The Vita will scale images to around 100kb

* Any 16x9 wallpaper 960 x 544 or larger will work just fine as long as it's .jpg.

* Icon text is somewhat difficult to read on a white background.

* The lockscreen (start screen) will have the time in big white text to the left.

* **Please use [imgur](http://imgur.com) for your uploads.**

So here's what I think of them:
I've been playing Unit 13 with them
Take in mind that they won't change a whole lot. They improve the experience a little bit. If you've got $7 dollars

I hope this clears up some doubts. And feel free to ask me questions about them

Yes I was the last person to receive the game. No I am not keeping the game. No I did not sell the game. I finished it and shipped it out. That was a few weeks ago. The person who was supposed to get it never received it and this is why. Around the time that I sent out the game the town that I live in was hit by a tornado (Hazelwood MO). The town post office was one of the buildings hit. The package was not damaged and I have been told that the package should be shipping soon now that damages have been repaired and everything has been put back the way it was. To everyone I am extremely sorry for the long delays and I hope that these kind of delays will not happen in the future. ,t5_2sjmv,True

EDIT: Also of note is that the store page for the game on psn solidifies the idea that there is online play, but Network Battle Mode is poor wording when you only mean local play, on an online service that is called the Playstation Network.
So

EDIT:  04/24 - Arc System Works has removed the trailer that advertised online modes and uploaded a hastily edited variation of the japanese trailer.  This is how it looks now.

##Share your custom Vita wallpapers here.

Things to consider when making wallpapers:

* Scaling of .jpg images works fine but .png images need to be the proper resolution.

* Vita game screenshots make great wallpapers.

* Tiered sets like [HorizonShadow's post](http://www.reddit.com/r/vita/comments/q3i8b/i_made_a_tomb_raider_wallpaper_set_for_you_guys/) work quite well on the Vita. ([tutorial](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqgZlqLAbQ8))

* The resolution for the Vita is 960 x 544.

* Any 16x9 wallpaper 960 x 544 or larger will work just fine as long as it's .jpg.

* Icon text is somewhat difficult to read on a white background.

* The lockscreen (start screen) will have the time in big white text to the left.

* **Please use [imgur](http://imgur.com) for your uploads.**

1359517676.0,17jhcq,Noob Guide for Ninja Gaiden Sigma Plus,rattlehaed,83,9,36,"Hey guys just felt like making this thread about one of my favourite xbox games of all time that happened to be ported over to the ps3 and then to the vita and now it's free for ps+ members


First off you should know that ninja gaiden is without a doubt one of the hardest games of all time (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jluv2HxFEqs). This is amplified further if you've never played this type of genre before. So expect to die


----Defense----


Your bread and butter for avoiding damage will be block (left trigger). It'll completely negate nearly every single enemy attack in the game


So you're thinking


Enemies generally have 3 types of attacks, which completely ignore the fact you're blocking. As to which specific enemy has which attack will be up to you to learn.


Your second line of defense is rolling. This is done by holding the left trigger and moving the left stick. This is what you will be using to negate strong attacks and avoid grabs. To negate a strong attack using roll, if you will, so you're no longer in the open and are back to blocking. Avoiding grabs is all about paying attention to all enemies on screen. If you notice one of them walking up to you or trying to jump behind you, you best be rolling out of the way because blocking will do nothing at all for you.


Note 1:  rolling and jumping is much faster than merely running as Ryu. This is good for allowing you to set up for easier kills (by getting you to your position faster)


----Offense----


So you've learned the art of not taking damage


The number one thing for a good offense in this game is positioning. Just because you avoided the first enemy's attacks doesn't mean you should just start swinging your sword. You have to get yourself in a spot where while you're pulling off combos an enemy won't just interrupt you


The weapon you have equipped makes a pretty huge difference. Overall you're going to have your cutting type weapons (i.e. dragon sword), which you'll have to learn (it also increases as you level them up) and it's own 1&amp;2 ultimate technique (even this sometimes changes depending on the weapon's level). On the whole, dragon sword will be your most used weapon, though I seriously recommend trying every weapon out because some weapons are without a doubt better against some enemies/bosses either due to their techniques or ultimate techniques.


What is this ultimate technique he keeps talking about? Well when you kill enemies you notice they leave behind either green, as that's the maximum). When Ryu pulls off an ultimate technique he is invincible and deals considerable damage AND enemies killed by your ultimate technique always drop green orbs that are much more valuable than if you had just killed them with a regular technique, which means more money to spend at the blacksmith.


Note 2: You can be interrupted pretty easily charging your UT


Note 3: You can also charge your UT without orbs


Note 4: Make sure you upgrade those weapons!


Note 5: To use ninpo hit triangle and circle at the same time, but on the back of the vita where you tap.


Note 6: To dive underwater: while in water hold down the x button.


----End----


I'm gonna stop it here as I think I covered just the general scope of how to play Ninja Gaiden


Also don't hesitate to message me on either psn or here for tips/help.

Now let's have a giant list of questions that are asked way too much and should probably not be asked.

**Can I pirate games/install CFW/use emulators/homebrew...**

No. We do not support piracy in any way. Any post made about this will be either removed or downvoted into obscurity.

**Will Vita get PS2 games?**

There are no plans. Sony has directly stated that they do not plan to emulate the PS2 due to the Vita's lack of power.

**Is ""X"" game coming out in ""X"" region?**

Use Google

**When is ""X"" game coming out?**

Use Google or find a website that indexes release dates. A few people like [the Vita page on GameFAQs](http://www.gamefaqs.com/vita)

**Is the Vita region free?**

The Vita games are region-free

As an example, it won't work on your copy. If you want the DLC to work, you'll have to make a new American PSN account.

**Do I need a memory card?**

Yes. Most games won't save without them. 4GB will be enough if you're planning on going purely physical cards.

**What games/accessories do you recommend?**

We get that question a lot here. For just broad ""what should I buy"" questions

**What PSP games can be transferred via PS3?**

[This thread on Cheap Ass Gamer is quite brilliant at keeping track of things.](http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=316058)

**I don't like the bubbles

Probably not. Sorry

**Can I sell/trade here?**

No. /r/gameswap has more security measures on trades than we do. Feel free to try there.

**Can I share my Vita PSN account with another person/Vita?**

From what I know, know it probably will not work.

**Is a Vita for me / Should I buy a Vita / etc.?**

You should try examining the Vita more. Go read more reviews. Go watch more footage. If you're positively stumped

**I really want X game on Vita!**

nEmoGrinder

**WiFi vs WiFi + 3G?**

3G is kinda useless on the Vita right now. The Vita's browser is crap and most games won't work over 3G. Not to mention most modern-day phones are capable of being Wi-Fi hotspots. If you have a phone that can do that you might as well avoid the 3G Vita.

**Can I play ""X"" through Remote Play?**

Only a handful of games and the PSone classic library works through Remote Play. You're much more likely to have a game not work. It's pathetic

**Please don't complain about occasional downvotes...**

If you have a question or need help of some sort (that isn't listed in this post)

Also

Finally, use Google and Reddit search! You might just find your answer.",,False,self,t5_2sjmv,1355198563.0,game-hotlinemiami1,moderator

1365283201.0,1btejq,One week ago I traded my 3DS XL for a PS Vita. Here are my thoughts.,Domo91,86,23,146,"So, but still has some issues. Here is my list of praises and complaints.

-The screen is WAY better compared to the 3DS. Not perfect
-The L and R triggers don't make my hand cramp up
-The fluidity of the entire system is much much better
-Two analog sticks is so awesome on a handheld. 
-PlayStation Plus is kick ass! Seriously
-The games really are console quality

But...
-The screen is a dust and finger print magnet!
-Even though the 3DS only had one analog stick
-The back touch pad is pure gimmick (too be fair
-Vita memory cards are way too overpriced. As soon as I made this deal
-Battery life seems worse than the 3DS
-Not all PS1 games are compatible with the Vita
-The L and R trigger feel like they are so loose

Overall, I want this console to flourish. Also, I can't wait to hear about more titles coming out, we need more shooters!

Thanks for reading! 

EDIT: Forgot to mention, Sly, retro city rampage, and all those games that are the exact same on either console, to share trophies instead of having to do things twice? 

But anyways

The game feels almost like the console version of AC. The controls are pretty much the same, but it didn't fix this), the music is pretty good and makes you involved in the game, but the sound quality is not so good, so I guess you guys should use headphones to experience the music and sound effects.

The graphics are actually pretty good and detailed, since the city is enormous and full of life and small details. 

Storywise it's interesting

In my opinion this game is pretty good, so I have no idea how it works. I would say that this is one of my favourite Vita games so far, can't wait for other similar games that are not dumbed down versions of big franchises.

I highly recommend it.

Your experience with gaming is unique. A lot of people will enjoy playing their old games again.  A lot of people may not have played a specific series, and it definitely made me interested enough to get Persona 4. Nostalgia and cluelessness wins out in a lot of situations.

* **Teams and studios gain experience on the new platform.** Porting a game is a great way to figure out how much the Vita can handle, tinkering around while making their port.

* **Generates numbers and information companies can use to measure interest.** A ported game onto a new platform can show how interested a community is in games for said platform. Developers can use sales figures to show how people are willing to buy and play Vita games. It doesn't get much simpler than that.

* **Made quickly and generates profit very easily.** With a simple 1:1 port, assets are available and gameplay mechanics are black and white).

* **Specific game threads have been removed from the menus at the top.**  The menus at the top have been adjusted and official threads won't be linked directly but instead search result sorted by the newest.  There hasn't been a new one in a while and the sidebar is pretty full as is.  If someone is interested in making a resistance one

* **A tooltip has been added when downvoting comments.**  The effect this may have will likely be minimal at best.  I just wanted to show those who might not know that downvoting dissenting opinions isn't really what reddit's about.  (hint: It goes away if you remove the downvote.)

* **New user flairs!** - Some PS Logos

* **Extra safe spoiler tags.** This was a week ago or so but I just want to reiterate that the spoiler tags have changed.  Users are now protected from inbox replies and not using the subreddit stylesheet when the tags are used properly.  If you get one in your inbox or don't use the stylesheet

1335802566.0,szwiy,Vita Subreddit is experiencing Blogspam,BesomeGames,69,11,43,"It became kind of clear to me just now what was going on. I may be overreacting but let me try and point this out to you:


1. PSVitaHub.com links keep getting submitted to the Subreddit even though it's a new and rather unpopular blog at this point in its' life.

2. Nearly all links are posted from the same user

3. The website is nothing but sensationalist. Most of their ""stories"" are opinion based or are not really news.

4. After checking PSVitaHub's YouTube page it becomes a bit more clear that the website is mostly sensational. They have a video for a ""leaked"" Call of Duty 4 on the Vita. 


What I am basically gathering from this is that the site is trying to do what it can to come up with content


As for how to react? I am not sure. If anyone has further proof of Blog spam or anything please help out. I know news is few and far between these days but I would rather this young and small Subreddit be filled with discussion rather then advertisement. If I am wrong

This also doesn’t include the 4 free games Sony is giving away today since I just read about this as I was making the list (I also plan on buying dokuro since it’s on sale):

•	Wild Arms (PS one Classic)

•	Patapon (PSP)

•	Piyotama (PSP)

•	Patchwork Heroes (PSP)

If you haven't already seen me around answering questions

Basically... too much awesome.  I don't think we were prepared for the sudden burst of community involvement!  We're going to increase our capacity for awesome ASAP.

Just to throw some numbers your way

If anything else comes up

Update 1 (Saturday Aug 11
So we're making progress but it's slower than we'd like.  Good news is that the issue isn't effecting everyone (it's actually a smallish percentage

If you ARE having the issue I know how you feel (literally

Update 2 (Saturday Aug 11
Not much else to say.  Apparently by our rough numbers

As far as a solution, I will let you know!

Update 3 (Sunday Aug 12
Okay, waiting for a conference call between all the studios to get more people helping with solving the issue at once.  Yay coordination!  

I know it's not really real movement but thought I should keep you guys informed that everyone involved is definitely still working to solve the issue!

Update 4 (Sunday Aug 12
So we are MUCH closer than ever before to figure out the issue!  Yay!  I still can't give an exact ETA because the issue doesn't lie in Queasy's jurisdiction (Sony handles the servers) but what I said before about the amount of awesome being too high seems to be the case.

We are looking at beefing up the servers but we need to know what part of the server process is the bottleneck first to make sure we're beefing up the right thing.  We're leaving that in a few very capable peoples hands... Jon and I have given them as much information as we could and haven't eaten yet today so we are headed out.  I'll let you guys know anything I can when I hear back from the great people we have working on the issue.

**tl;dr** The issue is HOPEFULLY going to be fixed soon!

*Edit 1*: (not sure what happend to this one). I got to try Dragons Crown and Spelunky and yes
 
*Edit 2*: I'll be giving full impressions later tonight. I am going to some panels right now. Post of you'd like a Chance to win PS plus 30 day codes.

*Edit 3*: I have got 3 more codes to give away! I got to play Arkham Blackgate, and Dragon's Crown (I also got to play Beyond Two Souls which someone requested). I'll write down my full impressions tonight when I'm in front of the computer.

*Edit 4*: Alright time to respond to some of your questions . Here is what I got to play or see. First I played Spelunky, Beyond Two Souls (PS3 exclusive), Killzone Mercenary, and exclusive gameplay footage of Watch Dogs (PS3, 4, 360, and XboxOne). Tearaway and The Walking Dead were also playable but I didn't have enough time. Also

**Spelunky**: I have yet to play any other version of this. What I played was a pretty short level where I had the option of several characters to start with. there was a girl in a dress, you can restart a level immediately and you die often. Escaping the ghost is freaking terrifying if you've collected a lot of gold.


**Dragon's Crown**: Damn, Amazon, Wizard, Archer, and Sorceress were all available to play. I chose the Wizard. The art was gorgeous and the voice acting appropriate for the theme. You start out in a tavern all hanging out together. This acts as the character select screen. After choosing a class you are prompted to customize your character's color and name. There are several different save slots to have multiple play-throughs going at once with different characters. 

Shortly, names, and possibly stats. As the wizard I had two different main attacks. One attack was fire based and would do varying actions depending on the inputs. You could cast a wall of fire that was short in range and would jut up directly in front of you. You could also leap into the air casting 3 deadly fireballs horizontally or blast a trail of fire out in front of the wizard for any enemy standing in its path to get burned. The other attack boasted similar variance and was also animated beautifully. 

In addition to two attacks there were also weapons that you could pick up during battle. The item I was privy to was the crossbow. It had one attack

What caught my attention most was not all that is described above, and teleport with ease. So often 2D beat-em up games fall victim to slow moving characters and getting around the world is a chore solved by jumping and divekicking. Which is something that I personally cannot stand. Gameplay was smooth with no frame rate drops. My only concern is aiming attacks along the X-axis (horizontal). There were times I thought I was lined up only to miss.

The world seems big and immersive with plenty of variance in characters and enemy types. However

Wow

1358060500.0,16hd04,I've spent hours playing the SOUL SACRIFICE demo. Here's my review of it.,JalenTheEpic,59,10,28,"I got my extra memory card

Despite my excitement I still thought it would be a bad Phantsy Star

This game is one of the greatest games I have played.
It's fun its addicting

**Good points**

* **Story:** Soul sacrifice has a nice story(I can't read japanese but I've seen videos explaining it)
* **High Replayability:** I've put more hours into the demo than I have lots of other games. It is very fun to replay the same levels with different goals or spells to change it up a bit. The boss fights are really fun and replayable(like on monster hunter
* **Spells/abilities:**The spell creation/combination system is great. I love how I'm able to create new spells my mixing others
* **Gameplay:**The game itself is loads of fun. It's really fun to battle and try to obtain new spells. I can't really think of another game this feels like. 
* **The level system:** The level system is based off of the amount of saves or sacrifices you do. More sacrifices= more attack
more saves = more defense
* **Multiplayer**:The multiplayer is nearly flawless. I live in the midwest in america, and once in the match things were very VERY smooth. There was zero to no lag. 

* **Touch controls:** Touch control is mostly optional

* **Great partner system:** You can get partners that you are able to level up and customize. If you sacrifice them they're gone until you bring them back. You can choose partners that suit the mission with their unique skills and spells.

* **Graphics:** This game looks amazing on the vita. It's within the best looking vita games out there. Simply amazing
 
* **Music:** The music is great. You can tell how much effort was put into the making of this game. The soundtrack is no exception to that.



**Bad points**

* Maps are just small sized arenas with not too much to explore
* Grinding can get annoying
* No reason not to get sacrificed because it gives you a huge bonus.
* Clothing options are really limited

Even though this game is just a demo
$40 for just this. It's amazing

If the demo is this amazingly good

**TL;DR-** If you like action RPGs this game is for you. Even the demo of this game is worth $40. This will be a day one buy for me

The demo does this game ABSOLUTELY no justice.

Between the IGN review and the game's demo I expected a short

Boy

The game's action is PHENOMENAL. I'm the type of guy that finishes Ninja Gaiden II on mentor difficulty (and enjoys every second of it) and I tend to shun games like assassin's creed because of the simple combat and easy difficulty. I was not expecting this game to have the solid and rewarding combat that it does!! 

Despite IGN's review making the game look like a float-kick-repeat affair, the bosses are varied (and difficult) enough to warrant trying out crazy strategies. When you get a grip of the combat (unlike Greg ""hide-and-recharge-special-powers"" Miller) it will look like a mexican wrestler had a baby with sailor moon but feel COMPLETELY NATURAL. There is even a gravity power you get from the start which is seldom shown-off on the reviews; it allows you to pick up and hurl debris at enemies adding an option for long-range combat to the game. I haven't been so excited about kicking a huge monster's ass since Shadow of the Colossus. The bosses are fun, very varied and fit in well with the story. For the sake of not spoiling anything, you will have to trust me in that they are NOT just differently shaped blobs and endless similar mobs. This brings me to my next point...

Everything regarding presentation is A+ material!! The comicbook cut-scenes were EVEN BETTER than reviewers made them out to be. They're very dynamic and let the developers do crazy things with the different planes to maintain the pace of the story. The video cut-scenes are also above average and would fit in perfectly in any modern anime. The story is expertly tied together; It manages to be deep while maintaining its cohesion and the character design is phenomenal and unique. The heroes, the game design feels tailored to comic book and mahou shoujo fans (and if you classify in either camp, you're probably already playing the game).


The music is also fantastic. Few are the games which have [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owCMTNx-OWI&amp;feature=relmfu) level of sound production. The soundtrack is varied but nothing feels even slightly out of place. I'd compare it to Cowboy Bebop's soundworks with absolutely no qualms (not an easy thing to do).


The challenges are actually... CHALLENGING! I'm talking about ""forget-about-ever-getting-gold"" challenging. If you're like me

I would honestly place this game along with Portal and Shadow of the Colossus in terms of novel gameplay and story. It's THAT good.

**EDIT: Here's how to install the themes on your PS3**

Make a folder called ""PS3"" and put it on a thumbdrive. Then put a folder named ""THEME"" inside the PS3 folder
Go to theme settings, which should take about a minute (because it's huge).

1368194254.0,1e2h1t,SEGA has 5 Vita titles coming for the next financial year?,gene_parmesan258,57,7,59,"In the second table in this source:

http://www.abload.de/img/capture2nrp2i.png

Under ""FY Ending March 2014"" -&gt; ""full year forecasts"" -&gt; then under the ""SKU"" column

Also consider that their plans for the first two quarters of this FY (up to September 2013 I believe)

So they have 4 Vita titles coming from September 2013 -&gt; March 2014 and predicted sales of 610k for them combined.  

I'm guessing the 40k title releasing in the next 2 quarters will be Japan-only

I reckon there's a high chance of the next Sonic game coming to Vita.  Perhaps Football Manager will migrate from PSP to Vita as well.  I also suspect there's a high chance of some niche Japanese stuff coming like a new Shining game or (perhaps) a Valkyria Chronicles.

The optimist in me wants it to be Yakuza.

Thoughts?
