EDIT: I feel like I should add that this is a post for Western calligraphy. I don't know Arabic or Eastern styles (yet). 

---

**Getting Started**

The best way to get started is to grab a beginner calligraphy book off a shelf. Art stores tend to have a wider range than regular bookstores. Still, [here's a link to a really great one (in English) as a pdf.](http://calligraphy-expo.com/eng/AboutCalligraphy/Library/LibraryOnLine.aspx?ItemID=1433) 

The books feel overwhelming at first, inks, paper types, font choices, etc. Don't worry! You won't need to spend an awful lot of money to start! In fact, you can start right now, probably

To do that: Grab two pencils, can be found here](http://calligraphybybillgrant.com/2009/04/10/time-to-get-to-work/). You can also use a whiteboard and a broad tip whiteboard pen. 

Okay

I suggest you find an alphabet that pulls you in, just Google image search a name ('Gothic', 'English Script', 'Fraktur', 'Carolingian Minuscule', etc.).

---

**Nibs and Pens**

Depending on what type of script or font you'll want to be writing, feathers (quills), and of course metal, all in various forms. 

[Here is what I currently have going for me](http://imgur.com/Ccc34). (I've got a quill somewhere as well, [number 2](http://imgur.com/1sI7j), [close-up 1](http://imgur.com/sCXJ4), [close-up 2](http://imgur.com/1HmH4). You will see paintbrushes here as well. You can use flat ones just as you would metal nibs (though they flow more), or use a tapered point to help fill in details.

The David Harris book I linked above is really great at showing you what type of pen to use with what font. But here is a list!

* Rustic Capitals - square nib
* Square Capitals - wooden
* Uncial and Artificial Uncial - oblique nib or quill
* Insular Majuskel - oblique nib
* Insular Minuskel- square nib
* Carolingian Minuscule - square nib
* Foundational Hand - double pencils or square nib
* Early Gothic - oblique nib
* Textura Quadrata - square nib
* Textura Prescisus - square nib
* Gothic Capitals and Versals - square nib
* Lombardic Capitals - best to draw outline with narrow nib then fill with ink (I use a flex nib or round nib)
* Bastard Secretary - square nib
* Bâtarde - quill
* Fraktur and Schwabacher - square nib
* Bastard Capitals - square nib or bamboo nib
* Rotunda - square nib
* Humanist Minuscle - either oblique or square nib
* Italic - square nib
* Humanist and Italic Capitals - square nib 
* Italic Swash Capitals - square nib
* Copperplate/English Script - flexible nib or Copperplate nib (they have a bend)
* Imperial Capitals - flat
* Cadels - outline in pencil

A straight pen has an oblique cut nib (about 70° to shaft)

It really doesn't matter too much if you're using a straight or angled nib, I've seen them too often...)

I hardly ever use round nibs (they have a circle of metal in the front)

---

**Ink**

When it comes to ink, lets talk ink!

So there are two types of inks: drawing ink and calligraphy ink. Drawing ink tends to be thinner and mostly only comes in black or an umber shade. Calligraphy ink is thicker

[Here is a lovely picture of my inks.](http://imgur.com/Jz58T) It's a German company called Rohers, though! 

You can also see that I'm using a palate (I think it's for aquarell paint, and immediately into another to get some interesting tones on paper. This stops my pure ink from being ruined. 

I've also included some gouache paint. If you mix it with enough water (thus the little jars) you can make them fluid enough to write with. Gouache is amazing in that it doesn't lose pigmentation when you dilute it with water. Aquarell is not quite as good. Acrylics and oils are usually too thick

A tip to stop your larger bottles / jars from tipping over (my table was blue thanks to tipping a full ink bottle over a few months back) is to [cut some holes into sponges and put the inks in them](http://imgur.com/mYLKs). You can also use the sponges for your drips!

---

**Paper and What to Write On**

You do not want to use printer paper. It is usually 70g and doesn't deal well with the amounts of water you'll be using. Start with something around 120g weight. 

I prefer 200g the most. Also, though, so don't just go out and buy tons! Find something that feels good between your fingers, buy a couple of sheets and then buy more later. 

I found this really wonderful block of Aquarell paper (200g

I tend to go for Aquarell paper, and the ink tends to run, but it's great for precise works. 

[Here's some examples of what I have lying around](http://imgur.com/mIfcE). The 'Roni' is written on the 200g Aquarell paper

You can also write on other things! Cardboard, canvas, etc. Your imagination is your limit. Stick to paper while practicing (the cheap kind too), though. You also might need different inks / instruments depending on what you write and/or might need to put a ground substance down first. 


---

**Lastly**

Once you know what you want to write

Now, how the ink flows, how shapes get made. You want to fill sheets of papers. 

After you've got a pretty good consistency down,  so [here's an example from me](http://imgur.com/0uCzr). You'll see that I used a 3-5-3 spacing (ascenders-main-descenders). Look and see what your book recommends, although this is standard. 

---

**Extra Info**

I always keep a glass/jar of water next to me. It's great to dilute the ink slightly and for added effects on paper. Dip your pen into the water first

After you've gotten the basics of a font down, [Birgit Nass](http://www.birgitnass.de/). 

Sponges, dab, smear, etc. 

Put a lot of ink on a pieces of paper

Don't be afraid to get messy! You're making art!

So I was discussing with roprop my latest idea:

**TL;DR:** Want to create a reference page for calligraphy letter styles. Need help figuring out how to do it in the best way.

Every so often we want to write something in a font

So

So, Roman, Cursive - style, Lombardic, Uncial / Foundational, Typographic,  Other

The only thing is

**What I want:** Easy to reference page for letter styles and (as many as possible) variations based on letters

Also

Thanks guys! Especially thanks to those that help!

P.S. I'd like to start this project within the next week; preferably this weekend if possible. I'd put permanent links on the sidebar,,False,self,t5_2rkjt,False,,True

1363363386.0,1actde,Beginner's Material To-Buy List (Broad Edge style and Pointed Pen in comments),xenizondich23,29,0,17,"Here’s a small beginner’s material guide for broad nib scripts (Roman, and some Renaissance).  I went into detail on some of the varied types in my [101 Beginner’s Calligraphy Guide]( http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/comments/zbvqf/calligraphy_101_for_beginners_and_advanced_artists/)

Usually when starting out you’ll want to acquire a simple tool or two

**Calligraphy Marker**: Markers are good for starting out, or use a whiteboard marker on a whiteboard.

**Cartridge Pen**: It’s usually better to start with one of these

- *Pilot Parallel* (~$10 each) They come in 4 standard sizes: 1.5mm, buy a converter and fill it with ink from a bottle or fill the barrel of the pen directly. 

- *Lamy Joy* (25 Euros ) This was the calligraphy pen I started with. Lamy makes fountain pens

- Other pen set companies include Masterpiece, Rotring, Schaeffer and Speedball. They are all *okay* sets. Some work better than others. In general, you will never have very crisp or sharp lines (except the Pilot Parallel) because they are all modelled after fountain pens and have slightly rounded nibs on the front. They are still much more practical for taking travelling or to work / school, though. None of them are too expensive.

**Nibs**: In general, and you can usually find boxes of them so I urge you to buy a few of each type to get a feel for them. You should clean your nibs after you are done using them every time. Else they’ll end up turning rusty and looking black like my first nibs. Every so often, take them apart and clean them in ammonia for best use.

- *Speedball Set* ($10) is a great set to start with in general. [It’s a holder and a few nibs]( http://www.amazon.com/Speedball-Calligraphy-No-1-Artists-Project/dp/B001QWUHF4/ref=sr_1_5?s=office-products&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363361809&amp;sr=1-5) for various styles

- Go to your local art store(s) and see what they stock. Often you will just find loose boxes of nibs and holders so pick and choose!

**Ink**: You can use various types of ink for dip nibs. Preferably use inks marked for Calligraphy, since they are both meant for different styles. I can’t forbid you to use them, but do your research on them. 

- *Noodler’s Inks* (~ $10 per bottle) are fountain pen inks

- *Rohrer und Klingner’s Ink* (5 Euros per bottle 50/100ml) this is the ink that I use. I love it. It has very vibrant colors

**Paper**: I advise against using printer / copier paper

You can buy paper pretty much in any art, but I will also buy large A2/3 sheets in various colors to write on. The lowest weight I go to is about 140g, and usually not heavier than 220g. Aquarelle and watercolor blocks are great for calligraphy, as well as marker papers.

I suggest finding some cheap slightly heavier paper to practice on. Maybe your office supply store has blocks of 100g paper? That should be perfect to start with.

**Misc tools**: All of these aren’t necessary

- *A glass with water.* This is to mix with your inks

- *Ink well or Aquarelle tray* I use a Van Gogh aquarelle tray to pipette my inks in when I write. This lets me mix them

- *Ink syringe or pipette* lets you put inks into a well

- *Paper towels or a rag* to wipe your pens on. Also sponges.

- *Ammonia* to clean your nibs in if they get too encrusted with ink

- *Old Toothbrush* to scrub your nibs with. Use with diluted dishwashing soap.

**Places to Buy**

- Art supply stores, your local neighbourhood one

**No matter your skill level

If there is one thing that makes what you do more than fancy writing with pretentious pens it is writing in a bloody straight line. Take just a little more time and get it right. When you practice something wrong you just have to unlearn it. Every time you write without guidelines you are only screwing yourself and producing work that will grate on the nerves of anyone who appreciates calligraphy no matter how cool your font

On a more specific note, consistency can be hard, whatever, but if your verticals aren't all vertical, draw some lines and do it right. It only takes a few seconds to draw a dozen vertical lines in pencil. Just do it and then your work will look like a developing calligrapher and not like my little sister got into my pens. Again, you only screw yourself by getting in bad habits. Do it right.

Most drummers think they can keep time without a metronome. Most are wrong. It doesn't make a person a shitty drummer to not be able to keep perfect time

Sorry for being such a grouchy old man

A little history: This roundhand was developed in France after the french generals were ordered to use only a certain selection of writing scripts for all their forms and stuff

Now, and it's become the beautiful script it is today. It, unlike most other script styles, is written with a broad edged nib, thus making it ideal for people who want to write a ""roundhand"" type of cursive script, but don't have a pointed pen! (It's also, notably, e.g. fountain pens, although they're practically identical. Anyway! On to the goodies!

**From [A New Booke of Hands](http://shipbrook.net/jeff/bookshelf/download.html?bookid=2) (1611):**

To make common Inke of wine take a quart
Two ounces of Gumme let that be a part
Fiue ounces of Gals
Long standing doth make it the better to be.  
If wine ye do want
And then as much stuffe as aboue at the least.  
If Inke be too thicke
For water doth make the colour more dim.

There are a couple other recipes which follow that one

**From [A Booke of Secrets: Shewing diuers ways to make and prepare all sorts of Inke

*To make Inke to write vpon paper.*

Take halfe a pint of water, which being mixed together make a quart &amp; a quarter of a pint more, then take six ounces of gauls beaten into small pouder, and sifted through a siue *[sieve]*, put this pouder into a pot by it selfe, and poure halfe the water, wine, take likewise foure ounces of victriall *[i.e. vitriol]*, water, couer the three pots close

*To make Inke for parchment.*

Make it in all points like to the inke aforesaid, that is, of each halfe a pint.

*Another sort of Inke.*

Take a quart of cleare water, let it stand three daies, and stir it three or foure times euery day, then take thirteene ounces of beaten gaules, and put them into a new earthen pot that is wel leaded, poure into them a quart of cleane water, that done, and let it seeth till it consumeth about a finger deepe, poure into the cloath a cup full of good vineger, cast it away

*Another of the same sort

Take the beaten gauls, poure out of each pot a like quantitie, and it will be blacke, then put into it a little beaten gum, &amp; it will bee good inke.

*Another.*

Take a quart of strong wine, but let it not seeth, then put into it foure ounces of gauls, two ounces and a halfe of gum Arabike, and two ounces of victriall, al beaten into smal pouder, and sifted through a siue, and it will be good inke.

*Another.*

Take an ounce of beaten gaule, and when the gum is almost consumed, strain it through a cloath, and put into it almost halfe a cup of victriall beaten to pouder.

*Another.*

Take a pint of beere, then put to it three quarters of an ounce of greene victriall, in small pouder, and let it seeth againe, when you take it off the fire, cast into it three quarters of an ounce of gum, and a small peece of alum *[potassium aluminum sulfate]*, and stir them all together till it be cold.

*Another.*

Take two handfull of gauls, (which you wil) then let it stand eight houres, straine it from the gaules, and put victriall therein, and to the victriall a third part of gum, set it on the fire to warm, but let it not seeth

*To make inke vpon a suddaine

Take a wax candle, till the smoke of the candle hangeth theron, then put a little warme gum water into it, which tempered together will be good inke.

*To keepe Inke that it sinketh not into the paper neither that it come not off

Take the shels of hazell nuts, put a little salt into it. To keepe that neither Mise nor eat or fret the paper, put a little wormewood water into the inke.

I intend to make this the post people go to whenever they have a question regarding both stationery and calligraphy, however, update this top post with the information we pool. So I'll start off with a few questions. 

* *Types of paper are categorized (mainly) by their density (also called [""Grammage""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_density#Grammage)). Where a typical xerox sheet's grammage is about 80g, which provide not as heavy a load but still heavier than, say, a ballpoint bic?* 

-When using standard paper for practicing, if the paper you're using isn't **acid-free**, the sheets will discolor and deteriorate, eventually becoming yellow and brittle with exposure to light over time. Even still, densities of sheets come in several flavors of smoothness, which isn't too much of an issue for square nib users. If you're using a pointed nib, however, but it will really damage your equipment. **Smooth** is definitely the way to go for pointed nib pens.

* *Many companies that offer [pads of paper meant specifically for the use of calligraphy](http://www.amazon.com/Strathmore-400-Series-Calligraphy-sheets/dp/B000KNNVX0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350437560&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=calligraphy+paper) utilize specially treated sheets of paper similar to magazine sheets, which do you prefer and why? Are there some other side effects to using one over the other? Or are there just different situations or pen setups that make one more favorable in that case?*

-There are so many varieties of treated papers that choosing the one that's right for you becomes a matter of preference, and stationery. Just like before, you're still going to prefer the smooth treatments such as **Vellum or Bristol**, especially if you're using a pointed nib. However, if you're using lighter, more watery inks, you might want to give **watercolor/aquarelle** pads a try, any surface meant to be used with any kinds of paints are going to be responsive and cooperative with calligraphic inks

* *For those of us partial to the more cursive and thin fonts such as Copperplate or Spencerian as opposed to the bolder and straighter fonts such as Black-letter or Traditional Old-English, graph, and dotted) which is more accommodating to the writing style at both beginner levels and expert levels? And the second part: Would you rather make your own guided sheets that have slanted ruling? Or perhaps you are privy to commercial slanted guiding stationery specific for calligraphy is available in larger quantities.*

-""Training pads"" come in **various sizes and paper types for different fonts**, but the ""try before you buy (in bulk)"" option isn't available. Unfortunately, the best thing we can say for you if you can't find something that works for you is to **make it yourself**. Personally I think it rare that you don't find something already commercialized unless you're looking for something phenomenally niche. If that happens to be the case, then you can always find the stationery you like and are comfortable with and find some way to make your own guides that you can put on the paper itself. Whether it's through a light table, office printer, or projection... where there's a will, there's a way.

* *It is not uncommon for a deliberate and specific occasion (read: commission/not for practice) to use [special forms of card-stock](http://instagram.com/p/RvUHbdBN12/) as opposed to a sheet of paper to really bring out the classiness of a piece and make it look marvelously fancy. For those of us that are planning to take calligraphy past the hobby level

P.S.
It would be quite helpful if, and another from quite a more frugal standpoint.

Firstly, you can now admire this wonderful sunny theme made for us by /u/rubrica! Thanks a lot! :D You're awesome. /u/xenizondich23 will make a new banner for the theme soon.

We have also distinguished periodic/regular posts a bit by colouring the title blue. Apparently not all of you notice the Word of the Day posts! *hint hint :)*

**Link flairs** have now been implemented. This is response to previous discussions about making it easier to give constructive critisism. The idea is that people put flair on their posts as an indicator of what level of feedback/critisism they want. With this in use

The link flairs currently available are ""request"", ""tutor me"" and ""be brutal"". Use them when relevant, and let us know what you think!

Note that the ""flair"" button appears after you've submitted the post. It looks [like this](http://i.imgur.com/gLpCPv4.png)

**The archives** have been [moved to the wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/archives2013summer). The archives will also soon include every scheduled/periodic/regular post posted by /u/callibot. This is expected to also include the Penpal Signup posts hitherto posted by /u/terribleatkaraoke as well as the Progress posts hitherto posted by /u/reepicheep37. You're both awesome. Thanks! :)

Because one archive page is not enough, or message the mods if you can't! :)

**The [Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/index)** is being split up into separate pages to make it less cluttered. Currently only the [FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/Calligraphy/wiki/faq) and all of the archives have pages of their own

Some say in ice.  
From what I've tasted of desire  
I hold with those who favor fire.  
But if it had to perish twice
I think I know enough of hate  
To say that for destruction ice  
Is also great  
And would suffice.

**I am sorry if I end up sounding critical in all this** 

I ***know*** that many are beginners here

I ***know*** that it's all art and being nit picky on definitions can sometimes get silly, we heighten language and glorify it to bring due respect to the meaning! 

I notice around here a confusion of terms. 

People say ""font"" when they should say ""hand"" or ""script"". 

People use terms like ""kerning"" when in calligraphy

Kerning refers to moving around a letter that is already created. 

Letter spacing for calligraphy depends heavily on how you made the previous letter. Sheila Waters, you want to give as much space between the letters as there is in the letters. (You do this to give the word a consistent texture). So I hope you can see that there is a difference there. 

There are posts here that are, and not calligraphy. I'm not saying kick the letterers out. I **love** lettering, and I wish I could do it better, I think we must make a distinction and not call lettering calligraphy, however. 

Calligraphy is *penmanship* while lettering in *draftsmanship*. They are both *awesome* but they are

I'm being oh so technical here

**Lecture over, and definitions don't make anything more or less aesthetic :)**

Calligraphy should be thought of, in each detail of the creation. When you draw, you sketch and then fill in, erase and outline, modify and edit until you're finished. Why shouldn't it be the same way to write? All you are doing is ""drawing"" letters rather than people, or birds, or trees, almost every one used vertical ones for slant as well. Only those who had done it for decades

Drawing each letter in its own, poise and beauty is not a bad thing, if anything it is a good thing. What an aspiration to be able to make something so elegant and beautiful that each and every detail of it was beautiful on its own, and even more beautiful together. Whether it be running, gymnastics, sport or chess, drawing or clay making, whether it be anything under the sun

In closing, to draw, to labor, to perfect and retouch, to strive after the unattainable, only to obtain it in the end. It is a worthy goal, and no matter how you achieve the end result,


By the way, simply that it is an imperfect method to reach the goals that you are most likely trying to reach. If your goal is to make a pretty letter and you don't care if you can do it without the tracing paper or not, then by all means trace it! There is no sin in the act.

I posted this for the great people over at /r/Handwriting and was referred here

I've recently been looking for someone with immense calligraphy skills to design a new text-based logo for my band Me Versus I. Right now our logo is used with a free computerized font that we got off of Freefonts

Anyone with a scanner or a PC art tablet would be great. The logo we have now itself is pretty simple, but it just doesn't compare to a unique original hand-drawn logo.

Your art will be going on my bass drum to be toured around the US with, stickers, CDs, and loads of other merch. You could make one, or two, or even five logos, and the one we choose we'll be forever in their debt. Think of it not only as doing a favor, we know all about improvement and trial/error.

Below is the logo as it stands now. You can use this as a reference and to get an idea of what we're looking for. It's elegant but sharp and rugged. It should be aesthetically pleasing

**You don't need to send anyone anything for this.**

Unlike the Christmas Card exchange (I still haven't gotten any card *sad*) you won't need to actually send anyone anything this time around.

---

**What to Do?**

I suggest that if you're making a card for a significant other, feel free to tell them how much you care on this Valentine's!

---

**Criteria**

**1** *It should be Valentine's themed-related.*  What does this mean? You can buy a store-made card, white, red. But keep it in the spirit of love. 

(Think of it this way: If you're making a zombie munching a brain card, you're okay.)
 
**2** *There should be calligraphy on it somewhere. Any writing should be calligraphy.* 
 
**3** *Please refrain from posting personal information.* 

If your card is full of names, and other such information that might make it easy for an internet stalker to find you, please don't post it. Also, we don't want to hear about how great your sexual life is in card form. Have respect, to us, your SO and yourself in posting. 

**4** *You have until February 14th to post your results.*

Feb. 14 is Valentine's Day. If you post after that time

**5** *This is not a contest.*

This is just another place to show off your work. This is not a contest. If someone did a bad job at their calligraphy

Welcome to the spring shades of lavender. We'll keep it around a few months

Also

I'd also like to point you into the direction of /r/inkporn. Thanks to /u/thing1thang2, and it needs subscribers, so go ahead and lavish over your inks over there.

Lastly, then resize and rearrange all without having any image editing program installed, but I shall persevere! I'll have this rolling out later today if it goes without a hitch.

Thanks for reading!

What I suggest is this:

Make a post in a format like this: 

    | Number | Author | Title| Publication Year | Link | Notes | Example Pages
    |:-----:|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:------|
    |1||||[]()||[1]()

Then you take some pictures of the book, as to what makes the book great. 

If it's an ebook please mention that. Screenshots are possible here.

Personally, bibliophile!)

My calligraphy is atrocious and my pens are quite frankly awful

Life towers far above me

A strident in his hand;

I sweep my eyes to left and right

Survey this sunken land.



The shadows cling to everything

The light clasped in a clot;

And all that I hold beautiful

Is wrought and caught in rot.



It wasn’t always like this though –

I still remember times

When Life had forged a place for me

Amidst its tender rhymes.



But now the night has fallen fast;

And all my dice are cast;

I stand before its mighty gaze

And know I cannot last.



Its strident slowly lowers down;

It points below to me;

In ancient tones

It speaks: ‘Now bend your knee’.



And in Its breath

Of all that I can see;

Crescendos of existence

Slowly bearing down on me.



I cannot take it anymore;

I stand

It seems as though,

Beyond the nether-veil.



But no.

I am not done here yet.

I raise my head

Life retreats away from me;

It trembles at my gaze.



And all the mystics of Its world

The centaur,

They gather round for my reply;

I say... ‘go fuck yourself.’



His weapon breaks; it falls to Earth;

The shadows slip away;

The sun climbs high and frees the light

To shine on the new day.

*


Life may try to break me;

To bend at its command;

But I am made to live and last

And to the night
