1375632844.0,1joo0t,Famous reddit users: /u/Unidan,UnholyDemigod,444,68,80,"Date account started - 24 Sep 09

To say /u/Unidan is the most popular user the site has ever had would not be an exaggeration. Every time you venture into a thread asking who your favourite user is, and he does it with the most infectious enthusiasm, so much so that after seeing a comment start with ""biologist here!"", it's impossible to not be overcome with joy. Unidan is a biologist in real life, and in any thread that pertains to the field of biology, whether it be the functionality of a carnivorous plant, or how insects could decimate all of humanity if they chose to, Unidan was able to remain under the radar, making him known to probably every user on the site, because he's that much of an awesome guy. 

**Notable events:**

* [does an AMA and promises to answer questions until the thread is locked.](http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1d42co/i_am_the_excited_biologist_ama/)

* [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1ikkhp/so_this_isnt_a_tree_it_is_a_weed_more_pictures/cb5dme9?context=3) are [some](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/1cz41n/what_is_the_most_unbelievable_fact_you_have_ever/c9ldj41?context=3) examples of the [comments](http://www.reddit.com/r/WTF/comments/1eijha/this_looks_like_a_nice_place_to/ca0ldhh?context=3) that made him famous. 

Unidan has agreed to answer a few questions about himself. 

**How did you discover reddit?**

&gt; I discovered Reddit through my friends who suggested it to me. /u/hypno_beam is the guy who actually pulled me onto it and got me to make an account

**Do you like being reddit famous?**

&gt; It's certainly interesting! It's actually opened up some interesting doors for me in the way of becoming more involved with science education and science writing. It's been really cool to be able to spin some of my procrastination time into work time, as when I don't follow through on something, I have about a thousand messages in my inbox telling me to get my act together!

**What do you do in real life?**

&gt; In real life, a nitrogen biogeochemist! I also teach at my university, this upcoming semester I'll be teaching a course in Animal Behavior. Aside from my professional stuff, I hike for fun (here's a shot I took this weekend on a hike with friends in Connecticuit), play games with friends, all the usual stuff. A lot of my friends have some interesting things about them which makes some of my free time pretty wild, too. For example, though now I'm trying to get a bit more into cycling and such. To counter-act physical activity, and I still meet up with alumni to put on shows every now and again. We performed in the Del Close Marathon most recently, but the other two guys were super nice).

**Is your reddit personality much different from your real personality?**

&gt; A bit, I'm very sarcastic which I think gets underplayed through Reddit when I'm trying to be more informative! Also, in real life, my friends make fun of me constantly for the Reddit fame, so there's a lot more cursing.",,False,t5_2wevq,True

To call karmanaut the most notorious and well-known user in the site's history would not be far from lying. Since joining the site, that being that there's only 2 people on this site. You, and karmanaut controlling every other account. The reason being is that karmanaut has been proven to be behind several other high profile accounts, such as [bechus](http://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/cl81x/a_violation_of_trust_and_community_values/c0td6ln), [ProbablyHittingOnYou](http://www.reddit.com/r/SubredditDrama/comments/pwrtf/the_karmanaut_is_phoy_pastebin_file_now_with_100/), and [RedditNoir](http://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/ugzsl/is_there_anything_an_ordinary_reddit_user_can_do/c4vbvpc). Not only does he have those, he also make alts just for general posting, due to earning 100K karma in about 6 months (which he did 3 years ago which is even more insane), things quickly went downhill for him. After removing Bad Luck Brian's AMA, the horde dissipated

**Notable events:**

1374930007.0,1j5paj,[MODPOST] Howdy folks (and some announcements too),UnholyDemigod,96,18,21,"Howdy readers, I thought with the subscriber count being what it is

First of all, in case you need to explain what's actualy going on, or submit several links together, that sort of thing. I also disabled downvotes, because just because you don't like it, it doesn't mean it's not something worthy of posting (I had to go to SRS and /r/mylittlepony for some of these links. Ugh). If you're one of the people who've disabled custom styles, please don't downvote anything in here. 

Secondly, Streetlamp le Moose and the Cumbox, and always having someone ask what it was in reference to. Using the dodgy search feature made it really difficult to find the links on a whim, so I made this place to store everything for easy finding. Because of this, I'd very much appreciate it if when submitting something, you can title it by what it's known as. For example, for the cumbox, as people who don't know the guy's name wouldn't be able to find it. Including 'cumbox' in the title makes for very easy searching ([like so](http://www.reddit.com/r/MuseumOfReddit/search?q=Cumbox&amp;restrict_sr=on)). 

Secondly, please remember to use the no participation domain to avoid vote brigading. Think of it like this: archaeologists observe history. They don't interfere with it. Also, please remember to use the context provider if a comment needs it to save everyone else from having to click 'parent' several times. How to do both of these are provided in the sidebar. 

Fourth, something you don't like, things that were highly upvoted and then forgotten an hour later, etc etc. What does belong: stuff that reddit talks about for years (Wadsworth Constant, baconing narwhals, etc), things that consumed the site for some time (Boston Bombing stuff, etc). 

Fifth (last one), so you can browse at your leisure without having to specifically search for a certain post. Not everything gets put in there, because some things are only mildly famous, but not not-famous enough to warrant removal. Also, please don't repost stuff. Trying to do so directs you to the already-posted thread, so don't try and get cheeky and be all ""oh, but I didn't know"". I'm on to you bastards. You won't get banned or anything, just to keep the place free of clutter. 

And lastly (yeah, you'll tend to find that I'm pretty chill as a person, and even as a mod. I tend to be more personable than anything, so if you've got some questions just ask. It'll only cost you a dollar. I also like to speak a lot of shit, so if you crack the poopies because I'm not taking my 'job' as a moderator seriously, I'll just tell you to dry your eyes, princess. One thing I do take seriously though is the rules of the site, so if I see you trying to start a witchhunt

That's it from me. Thanks for reading. Unless you didn't read it. In that case

**Brief intro:**

/u/A858DE45F56D9BC9 is a user who posts 64 bit

* Reddit user makes joke about /u/A858 (his shorthand) about him being the “Stonehenge of reddit.”  /u/Fragglet decoded a following submission to discover ASCII Stonehenge with his ASCII signature. [Seen here.]( http://www.reddit.com/r/A858DE45F56D9BC9/comments/k96b1/201109081949/)

* Featured article. [Seen here.](http://www.dailydot.com/culture/code-redditor-secret-ascii/)

* /u/Fragglet decoded another post

**More complete story:**

/u/A858DE45F56D9BC9 has his own subreddit, he sometimes quits posting, sends his sub private, and/or deletes all of his old posts. This mystery user has 7 link karma though has never been observed to have posted anything other than self posts.

This user or entry into the /r/MuseumofReddit isn't as *epic* as perhaps the Confession Bear confessing to murder, but has sometimes garnered a lot of concentrated interest. For example, the link I posted above where other media websites have covered the /u/A858

As the previous link displayed, /u/A858 deleted the original post, however you can see the subsequent thread. If you noticed, /u/Fragglet was the decoder, and he has been the most visible-outside force of all of this. To perhaps explain /u/A858's post, I believe a user had joked /u/A858 was the ""Stonehenge of reddit."" Fittingly, this post was created in response to said joke.

There are a few theories with which I'm familiar as to the existence of /u/A858. The first, but because when it does garner interest he disappears initiating even more speculation.

The second theory is that he's using reddit's servers to document or archive data. This is probably not the case, and that's not something reddit provides.

The last theory I will speculate on is the possibility it's to attract and recruit cryptographers. Though, NSA, or some other private security firm. Also, if its purpose were to attract amateur cryptographers, deleting posts and becoming withdrawn is an, as of yet, unproven method of successful recruiting.

**AGAIN. Please. Don't make a nuisance in his or her sub.**
