Hi there fellow book worms! So I finally took some time to clean up and reorganize my bookshelves (i.e. make some space for the books that have been lying on the floor for months). Aaand here's the end result.

Left bookshelf

(1) French literature; (2 + 3) books on art, fashion, photography; (4) Dutch books, theatre and poetry, and my small DVD collection; (5) the big, heavy books who can't be put standing up.

Right bookshelf

(1 + 2) more books on art, fashion, photography; (3) English fiction with a few non-fiction intruders; (4) art books, catalogues, college related stuff; (5) my Pléiade collection (a collection of the ""greatest"" French authors and poets), which I inherited from my grandfather; (6) the ""languages"" shelf, with dictionaries, etc.
