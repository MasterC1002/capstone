Hey r/whatsthisbug



Recently I did an [AMA](http://redd.it/n54v9) over on [/r/askscience](/r/askscience) and several people asked me how they could get better at identifying insects in and around the home. One person in particular suggested I start a short class over on /r/UniversityofReddit to teach the basics of not only insect identification, each one focusing on a different order of insect. At the end of each presentation, there would be a short sight ID ""quiz"" where we could go over the process of identifying the specimens we talked about. If there's enough people, I'd be willing to throw in a prize near the end for the highest scores!

I think it would be a great opportunity to get the community involved and try to make a positive impact (...and maybe lessen the number of ""IS THIS A BEDBUG?!?"" posts we get...)
The resources provided by /r/UniversityofReddit are quite substantial and would provide us with not only Mumble/Vent servers to for discussion


So what do you think? If you're interested or have any suggestions,False,self,t5_2s3bw,True,,,t3_ok7fm
