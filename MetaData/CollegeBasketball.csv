Hello college hoops fans.

I'm pleased to announce our first annual intra-reddit Bracket challenge. Our sub will be competing against other subs for bragging rights as reddit's Bracket Challenge winner.

The point of the challenge is to have a bit of friendly competition between the subs while providing a chance to cross-promote.

If you'd like to compete

* A sub must have a minimum of 10 participants to win.
* All participants will submit a bracket to our [ESPN group](http://games.espn.go.com/tournament-challenge-bracket/en/group?groupID=17464).
* Participants will then [visit this page to enter your bracket for your subreddit](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dHZUb0pCem10LW93R2pubEdOUHE3cWc6MQ#gid=0).

    The top 10 brackets from each sub will be averaged to declare a winner.
* We'll also award a gold trophy to the top overall bracket
* All subs that compete will put a 'congrats to [winning sub]' banner on their subreddit for a month after the finals that links to the final standings.

So go ahead and join the ESPN group then lets us know which sub you're representing. Then
********

I work with a scouting service called [PremierBall](http://www.premierball.com/), Kentucky, Kansas, UCLA, and UNLV. We're national, with an emphasis on the west coast and in a few other hot spots around the country.

I've also been helping an NBA team evaluate players for the NBA Draft. I won't name the team or go into specifics about exactly what that work entails.

I'm a Philly native, and am currently based out of Las Vegas.

For some basic info on my background and story

For more on my background and to connect with me

I'll be watching (on ESPN) and tweeting about the HoopHall Classic today, Findlay Prep, and Archbishop Mitty. Those teams include elite high school prospects like Jabari Parker, Kasey Hill, and Aaron Gordon. For more on that, follow me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/jameskerti).

1372286033.0,1h50u3,Cool story about Coach K,WhatThePenis,238,56,95,"So I was at Coach K's Duke Basketball Camp this past week, what the diagnosis was

""Hey [my name]

I was star struck. I had no idea what to say so I stuttered a ""H-hey!""

He told me how he heard that I acted real tough when I got hurt (I was on the ground for 45 minutes having trainers look at me. I figured there's no reason to cry about what I can't control, and Coach K was standing there in the hallway. We shook hands, talked for a little bit, and he talked about how he was glad I didn't have to have surgery on my knee. Then Jon Scheyer and Ryan Kelly walked in, saying they wanted to meet the ""toughest kid at camp"". That made my day, and I told Ryan that when I came back from the injury, I would drop 36 in my first game to honor him. They all laughed and then Coach K said he would love for me to come sit courtside behind the Duke bench at one of the games next season and I happily agreed. We all took a picture together

So I guess it was a good trade-off for a broken leg!

Just thought I would share this story for anyone who wanted to read. 

TL;DR: Broke leg at duke basketball camp

*Champions of the B1G tournament, #4, and #5 seeds are gone, can Ohio State capitalize off the other low seeds' misfortune or will they similarly fall? In any case, Iowa State stands in their way--an always dangerous team out of the big twelve who annihilated 7th-seeded Notre Dame earlier in the weekend. Here's to a good game!*

* [“My Old Kentucky Home”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fsQj46swDvI) is sung at nearly every athletic event, it creates an eerie droning hum that sends chills up your spine. When singing the lyrics “We will sing one song...” it is tradition to hold up one finger.  
* [“The Y”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELwvDzwFYmw) is a Rupp Arena tradition that honors former players or notable people in the state’s history. During a long media timeout in the second half of basketball games, he or she will walk out on the court and hold up their hands to be the honorary “Y” in “Kentucky.” [LeBron James](http://elitistjerksports.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/lebrony.jpg), [Randall Cobb](http://media.kentucky.com/smedia/2012/01/31/21/40/MWzzb.AuSt.79.jpg), and former players like [John Wall](http://vaughtsviews.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Wall-.jpg) and [Michael Kidd-Gilchrist](http://ksr.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/mkg-y-emu.jpg) have come out to center court to a rousing round of applause.

*Random Trivia*
***
Kentucky is the all-time winningest program in NCAA history in terms of both total wins (2, and NCAA Tournament games played (157). UK is the only school in the country to win a national championship under five different head coaches (Rupp, Hall, Pitino, Smith, and Calipari), and the ‘Cats also hold NCAA records for Elite Eight appearances (34), and total postseason tournament (NCAA and NIT) appearances (61).  
    
By winning the National Invitation Tournament (NIT) twice (1946 and 1976)
  
The Wildcats have gone 861 consecutive games (non-exhibition) with at least one three-point field goal made

Actress Ashley Judd, is one of the biggest and most vocal ‘Cats fans in showbiz. She can often be seen [cheering courtside in Rupp Arena](http://www.sports-venue.info/sitebuilder/images/Rupp_Arena_7-542x408.jpg) or at tournament games.  
  
The nickname “Wildcats” became associated with the university in 1909 after the football team defeated the University of Illinois on the road in early October. Then-chief of military Commandant Phillip W. Corbusier stated the team had “fought like wildcats.” The nickname stuck and was later adopted as the official mascot

Unfortunately, forcing Kentucky to cancel the entire season. Interestingly enough, Rupp’s ‘Cats went 25-0 (14-0 SEC) the following season in 1953-1954, but declined an invitation to the NCAA Tournament after three players (Frank Ramsey, Cliff Hagan, and Lou Tsioropoulos) were ruled ineligible to compete due to the now defunct rule barring any players who had already graduated.  
   
***  
*What is and What is to Come*  
***  
The 2012-13 season was definitely a disappointment to almost every UK fan. Kentucky started the season ranked highly and came in with a great recruiting class, star player Nerlens Noel went down with an ACL tear, effectively ending any hopes the Wildcats had of salvaging an NCAA Tournament appearance. It has become a running joke in /r/CollegeBasketball, as everyone knows (and has not let us fans forget), Kentucky ended up losing to Robert Morris in the first round of the NIT in a game that really looked as though the Cats had thrown in the towel for the season. Following the season, Archie Goodwin and Nerlens Noel left for the NBA and both were selected in the first round. Julius Mays and Twany Beckham graduated, and Ryan Harrow transferred to Georgia State. Kyle Wiltjer (at the time of writing) is still debating a possible transfer.
  
The 2013-14 season outlook seems to be much brighter than the previous. Kentucky is bringing in the highest rated recruiting class EVER. Alex Poythress and Willie Cauley-Stein return to Kentucky for their sophomore campaigns and from all accounts, Dakari Johnson, James Young, and Marcus Lee (as well as in-state standouts Derek Willis, Dominique Hawkins, and EJ Floreal) look to revitalize the team, and have most people ranking them No. 1 overall to start the season.  
  
This team does not initially appear to struggle with the same chemistry issues that plagued the previous team, this team appears to be poised to bring the Big Blue Nation title No. 9.

* #10 Kansas State @ #14 Kansas: Sitting on three straight losses Kansas faced a Kansas State team who was both ahead of them in the conference standings and national rankings. Kansas pulled away in the first half and never looked back. Ben McLemore had 30 points on 9-13 shooting including 6 threes.

* Both at home and away to Iowa State: Both were come from behind overtime victories critical to maintaining Kansas's conference championship streak. Ben McLemore had 33 points on 10-12 shooting in the first game along with [this last second bank shot to send the game to OT](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z-qaHPwRrxw). In the second game Elijah Johnson hit 6 threes to and scored 39 to help Kansas secure their second OT victory over Iowa State in a row. Kansas outscored Iowa State 36-16 in both OT periods combined.

*Greatest Games*

There's a ton to consider

* [#3 Missouri @ #4 Kansas (2012):](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqK1sfEGqFA) In the final game of the Border War series Kansas avenged their earlier loss at Missouri by overcoming a 19 point second half deficit. This win also secured Kansas at least a share of the conference title. 

* [#15 Texas @ #3 Kansas (2007)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfA6Q-LFeAo): In Kevin Durant's only game in Allen Fieldhouse Durant scored 25 first half points to put Texas up by double digits before Kansas came storming back. 

* [#12 Indiana @ #6 Kansas (1993)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSZbiM8tfLE) In this back and forth thriller Indiana's Damon Bailey scored 36 including 15 from the free throw line but Kansas freshman Jacque Vaughn stole the show as he hit a game winning three pointer with 0.2 left in overtime to win the game.

* [Kansas vs #20 Kansas State (1988 Elite Eight)](http://www.rockchalk.com/games/g198836.sht): Kansas State had already won two of three that year but the game to go to the Final Four would be won by the Jayhawks. This game is seen as a turning point for both fan bases as Kansas State would eventually suffer through the 90's and Kansas would see success with new coach Roy Williams.

* [Kentucky @ #2 Kansas (1989)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49FRv8ELdCo) Because why not. Kansas scores 80 first half points in route to a 150-95 victory over Pitino's Wildcats.

* Camping for seats

While ""camping"" started with students actually setting up tents outside the fieldhouse

* Waving the wheat

Kansas fans ""wave the wheat"" with their arms after an opposing player fouls out and after the final buzzer in a victory.

* [The Rock Chalk chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=h51be27dN8c#t=63s):

Created in 1886 by a chemistry professor for the KU science club, Jayhawk, KU"" but was changed soon after to ""Rock Chalk"" in reference to the limestone found in Lawrence and used to build many of the buildings on campus. The chant has been known to rally troops in the Philippines, in World War II and was called the ""greatest college chant"" he'd ever heard by Teddy Roosevelt. Is used in modern times before games and after victories are sealed. 

* [The Intro Video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=UF2fToLaOak#t=60s)

It might as well be a tradition since it's awesome and you should watch it.

*History of Lawrence:*

****

Lawrence was founded in 1854 by a group of settlers from Massachusetts – hence the name of the street that downtown is centered around.  They were supporters of Kansas becoming a free state, abolitionist John Brown led a number of raids into Missouri, killing pro-slavery settlers and slave owners.  He is something of a local hero in Lawrence: Lawrence's Free State Brewery has a [large mural of him standing inside](http://www.kshs.org/places/capitol/tour/graphics/curry_tragic_prelude.jpg), which KU fans [altered](http://worldonline.media.clients.ellingtoncms.com/img/croppedphotos/2009/03/02/ku_bkc_mu_04900h400w_t650.jpg?eec9ecda5f66de59a37bbdb23c6f48523261b548) for a basketball game against Missouri.  Militant anti-slavery activists were nicknamed “Jayhawkers”, which is where KU took its mascot, the Jayhawk.  Lawrence was again raided in 1863 by William Quantrill in retaliation for an earlier Kansas raid on the city of Osceola.  The raiders killed most of the male population of Lawrence and destroyed a number of buildings; nevertheless, Lawrence persevered, as does one of the two high schools

**Iconic campus buildings:**

1364024898.0,1aum1g,Today was one of the best days of my life.,SockBramson,150,13,13,"[Relevant crappy cel phone pic here](http://i.imgur.com/hZCykJm.jpg)

I have been watching college basketball and the NCAA Tournaments for 15+ years now. It has always been a dream of mine to attend a game. One of those dreams that gets put off but you're not quite sure why.

I brought this up with my girlfriend a few months ago and she suggested we put some money aside and drive down to Raleigh next year for the opening rounds. Cool. So

Then we decided that if we could find some cheap tickets on stubhub maybe we'll go to a Sweet 16 game in DC this year. Maybe but I doubt we could afford that.

Then it happened. Yesterday I check stubhub and notice that opening round tickets are super cheap when it gets close to tip off. I tell my girlfriend and she says

""Yeah.""

""So am I. Are there any games nearby?""

""Uhhhh Philadelphia.""

""Cool. We should go.""

And it happened. I waited til 3 today and checked stubhub. $30/ticket. Ordered. Done. Let's go. Before I left I made this post here.

&gt; In about an hour I am going to fulfill a dream and actually attend an NCAA tournament game. I'm so excited. Hopefully the GTown/FCGU &amp; Oklahoma/SDSU games are good. Can't wait.

I was hoping the OU/SDSU game would be competitive and Georgetown wouldn't blow FGCU off the floor. Well we all know what happened there.

To put it bluntly

When they made that alley-oop I thought the roof of the building was going to blow off. Holy crap was that amazing.

To FGCU and their fans. Thank you. From the bottom of my heart thank you for making this one of the greatest days of my life. It was like in Rudy when his dad sees the Notre Dame field and tears up. It meant the world to me just to be there. And to witness that? Amazing.

To Georgetown and their fans. As much as you're hurting I hope you take some solace in that this game

So thank you,False,,t5_2rj3j,False,,Maryland,t3_1aum1g

* The entire 1976 season... as it was only one of seven ever perfect seasons culminating in a championship in NCAA basketball history
* 1987 NCAA Championship game vs Syracuse. This was the first tournament with the 3 point shot
* #1 Kentucky at Indiana, basically fueling the resurgence of IU in both the Top 25 lists and as a team in general. Tom Crean’s face is great in response to [the “ Watshot”](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KbNmJQllmg).

*Random Trivia*
***

* [IU athletic’s list of all of their facilities](http://www.iuhoosiers.com/facilities/ind-facilities.html)
* After winning the 1987 National Champion

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
* What is: IU lost 4 key players. Zeller and Oladipo are obvious at 2 and 4 pick in the draft, emphasis on fringe. The big question marks are our unproven but quite talented freshman class (led by Vonleh, Williams, Fischer), how much improvement comes from our sophomores (mostly Perea and Hollowell), and leadership (Sheehey, Yogi, etc. for starting 2 guard minutes. Crean basically plays 4 guards anyway so expect 3-4 of these 2 guards to get major minutes. We will be thinner down low so expect a perimeter oriented offense and fast break style surrounding Vonleh and Fischer/Perea. Defensively in the B1G we will be tested since we aren't big down low and won't have many big bodies off the bench.

* To Come: Tom Crean is ALWAYS recruiting so if someone checked back in next week our recruiting situation could be different. But our top priority is an elite point guard always. I'd say IU has as good of a chance to land Dante Exum as anyone, Ahmed Hill, Phil Booth, etc. are on our radar. James Blackmon has already committed for 2014 and [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpF4cI8Zzss) and others out there should speak for itself. Averaged something like 32 pts for his high school team and has done very well this summer also. Tre Lyles was committed before both parties realized IU wouldn't be a good fit. 
TL;DR we always are looking for good guards and wings and if we can land Okonoboh or another elite big man our 2014 class could be special.


***
*Random Tidbits*
***

* Larry Bird would have been a part of the 1976 undefeated IU team as a freshman.
* Bob Knight cried once describing how Isaiah Thomas was an ambassador of the game. He also stuffed an intern (secretary?) into a trashcan.
* Breaking Bad’s Mike Ehrmantraut (Jonathan Banks) attended IU
* IU hosts the largest collegiate bicycle race every year called the Little 500. It is generally a week of drinking and general debauchery
* For the years prior to Assembly Hall's renovation
* After Bob Knight's first game as coach, and team defense style of play. That student most likely came around as Knight's record in his first 5 years was 125-20.
* While we are regarded as a basketball school
* A funny [mock campus tour video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UCERVghyDms) since you made it all the way to the bottom.

On a side note, but definitely on the 23rd I'll need someone to take over for a day and make sure everything that day goes smoothly if someone signed up. Also, I'm giving everyone Independence Day off because 1) it's my favorite holiday and 2) we should be spending that time with friends and family instead of staring at screens half the day.

The Greats: Ray Allen, Richard Hamilton, Ben Gordon, Rudy Gay, Charlie Villanueva, Caron Butler, Khalid El-Amin, Hilton Armstrong

Greatest Games: Some of the best games in UConn history include winning the 1999 National Championship against Duke for UConn’s first ever title, Georgetown, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Louisville, Bucknell, Cincinnati, Arizona, Washington in 1998 (see video above)

Greatest Coach: [Jim Calhoun](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xokthY5zuPU). 866 wins all-time in Division I basketball, 4 appearances in the Final Four, 3 National Championships, member of both the College Basketball and Basketball Hall of Fame, and helped [27](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Calhoun#Former_players) of his former players move on to professional careers.

Greatest Rivalries: With the creation of the Big East in 1979, hard-fought, and entertaining game. These two schools played some fantastic games at Gampel Pavillion and the XL Center for UConn, the Carrier Dome at Syracuse, and many classics at Madison Square Garden.

[The Classic 6OT Game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3koPRFXzi3o)

[Final Matchup in the Big East](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BrESgvt9Wkc)

UConn had many other well known clashes with other former Big East schools and other regional institutions such as Georgetown, and Boston College.

What Is and What is to Come

The 2012-2013 basketball season was a tough year for the University of Connecticut basketball team. In transition with a new head coach in Kevin Ollie and dealing with no postseason play due to NCAA sanctions, and heart.


The new season faces many more challenges entering a new conference, Kentan Facey will be joining the huskies this fall and looks to jump into the rotation and provide value immediately. Facey, a Jamaican native, was fascinated by the University of Connecticut after watching Kemba Walker, Jeremy Lamb, and company go on their improbable run to win both the Big East and National Championships in 2011. Lasan Kromah is transferring from George Washington to help provide a deeper bench for Coach Ollie along with Neils Giffey and Leon Tolsdorf.


The extended future looks bright as well as Daniel Hamilton, former five star recruit Rodney Purvis is transferring from NC State to play for UConn in 2014. After initially considering UConn out of high school, he will sit out one year because of NCAA transfer rules and looks to take over the Husky backcourt in a year. So far, Kevin Ollie has done an excellent job recruiting despite NCAA sanctions and conference realignment. 

Even with weaker in conference play, has done an unbelievable job getting talented out of conference schools to play UConn at home, on the road, and at neutral sites. Finally, a brand new practice basketball facility is in the works. It will be located adjacent to Gampel Pavillion and looks to be [beautiful](http://blog.ctnews.com/elliott/files/2012/10/NightShot-SingleEntry-11.jpg). I as well as much of the UConn fan base are looking forward to the future of Husky basketball.

Schedule: Not Available Yet

**The Greats:**

**Greatest Games:**

*[Arizona vs. Illinois 2005](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXNQ4NJTYMc)*

Down 15 points with less than 4 minutes left in the Elite 8 Deron Williams lead the Fighting Illini back and ties the game sending it into overtime at 80-80. Illinois would then go on to win the game by 1 with Arizona missing a 3 point attempt at the buzzer

*[Illinois vs. Michigan State 1979](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&amp;v=U3j_-XyQJIY)*

In a battle between two top 5 teams, Illinois had beaten a No. 1-ranked team for the first time in school history.

*Illinois vs. UCLA 1964*

This was the season after UCLA’s first championship under John Wooden, “They Call Me Coach”. 

**Greatest Players:**

* [ Dee Brown

* [ Nick Anderson

* [Kendall Gill](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kendall_Gill)

**Greatest Rivalries:**

*[Illinois vs. Missouri](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braggin'_Rights)*

I personally enjoy the Braggin’ Rights game every year between Mizzou and the Illini. Overall, a neutral location, always drawing a huge crowd and is played on national television. It is a bit of a streaky rivalry, with Illinois winning 9 straight between 2000 and 2008, 8 in a row between 1983 and 1990, and Missouri with multiple win streaks of 4 in a row. Unlike most rivalries where the trophy travels home with the winning team, the trophy is displayed in a glass case in the Scottrade Center lobby, depending on who won. The unoccupied side has a plastic square reading “THE TROPHY BELONGS HERE NEXT YEAR” in the position where the trophy would go.

Any B1G fan will tell you that every conference game has the intensity of a rivalry game, Northwestern, and Indiana.

**Greatest Rivalries:** 

[Purdue vs. IU](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indiana%E2%80%93Purdue_rivalry#Men.27s_basketball) – This rivalry dates back (for basketball) to March 2


Purdue vs. Michigan State – This is a rivalry which has really come about in recent years, along with his wit and smarts, cause him to be well liked across the board. Well, every year, Purdue decides to ask one of the prettiest girls in school (a recruit) to prom. She never quite says yes, but she totally hints that she wants to go to prom with Purdue. Purdue makes dinner reservation and even gets a tie to match his date’s dress. Then, the night before prom, who is dumber than Purdue, this match-up has become one to look forward to every year.

[Breakfast Club:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_University#Breakfast_Club) On the morning of home football games

[Grand Prix:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Grand_Prix) the Grand Prix is a 50-mile go-kart race which is known as “The Greatest Spectacle in College Racing” which takes place every April. The karts are made from the ground up by student teams. This event tops off a week known as “Grand Prix Week” where you pretty much have an excuse to be drinking and partying around the clock. But there are also many other events that go on throughout the week as well.

[The Purdue Drum:](http://ecampusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/10/Purdue-Largest-Drum.jpg) Purdue has the world’s largest drum

*Campus and Surrounding Area*
***
**City Population:** West Lafayette

[**City Skyline**](https://marketing.purdue.edu/Toolkit/PhotoGalleries/Landscape-Aerial/aerial_campus_main.jpg) 
  
**Iconic Campus Buildings:** 

[University Hall](http://www.cla.purdue.edu/buildings/university.html) – Built in 1871, one building is technically a “bridge”, as seen here, so it is not considered an actual building. The other building, Beering Hall, is a few floors taller. Solution? Give the top couple of floors a different zip code so that they are not technically part of campus.

[Bell Tower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purdue_Bell_Tower) – Thought it is just under 20 years old, and full hour. It also plays the fight song and alma mater at 12:20 pm, 5:00 pm, and 10 pm. The reason “rings” is in “quotations” is that though bells exist, the sounds are all played through speakers because the tower structurally cannot actually have real bells swinging without it falling (apparently). Also, it is said that if you walk under the Bell Tower during your time at Purdue, you will not graduate in four years.

[Elliot Hall of Music](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliott_Hall_of_Music) – Elliot is an auditorium with a capacity larger than Radio City Music Hall and a stage as large as that at the Dolby Theatre. Holding just over [6, Elliot regularly hosts exams for students. Rarely will you leave Purdue without taking at least one exam in the Hall of Music.

**Local Dining:** 

[Triple XXX](https://triplexxxfamilyrestaurant.com/) – As you approach Purdue from the southwest, Indiana’s oldest drive-in has sat just off of campus since 1929. It’s so good, Guy Fieri came and visited. But seriously, they have an amazing menu featuring the Duane Purvis (peanut butter burger), the Drew Brees (the breakfast combo he used to get when was a student) and as of seriously like, 4 days ago, the David Boudia. If you visit West Lafayette

[Harry’s Chocolate Shop](http://www.harryschocolateshop.com/) – No chocolate. As the story goes

*Assistants*: Cornell Mann

**Key Players:**    

* **Chris Babb**: Senior. Defensive stopper. Shutdown a lot of elite scorers. 3 point specialist. Transferred here from Penn State and was a huge reason Hoiberg has been able to get Iowa State to the tourney so soon.       
* **Georges Niang**: Freshman. 6'7"" power forward. Excellent post moves and can knockdown the 3. Was a vocal leader and really helped stretch the floor to make Hoiberg spacing offense work so well.       
* **Melvin Ejim**: Junior. Leading post player. Led the Big 12 in rebounding and double doubles. All at 6'6"".

* **1957 vs [](/Kansas) Kansas** - Beat the #1 ranked

***
**Greatest Players:**    

* **Gary Thompson** - First Iowa State player to score over 1000 career points. Beat out Wilt Chamberlain in the 1956-1957 season for the Big Seven Player of the Year. Also helped Iowa State to the College World Series in 1957 playing shortstop. Retired number (#20) at Iowa State.      
* **Don Smith** - Known as Zaid Abdul Aziz in the NBA
* **Jeff Grayer** - Set all-time individual scoring record at Iowa State at 2
* **Fred Hoiberg** - Home grown in Ames
* **Marcus Fizer and Jamaal Tinsley** - We list these two together as they were the force behind two of the best Iowa State basketball seasons. Boasting a 34-0 home record while they played at Iowa State. 1999-2000 season these players helped Iowa State to a 14-2 Big 12 record and a Big 12 championship. Fizer was a consensus All-American. Big 12 Player of the Year. That team lost in the Elite Eight to Michigan State and was referred to as the “de-facto national championship game” by many sports writers.    
2000-01 saw Fizer leave for the NBA. But Tinsley led Iowa State to another Big 12 Championship and Tinsley winning Big 12 Player of the Year. *No one knows ^what ^happened ^^after ^^^that.*       

***
**Greatest Coaches:**     

* **Larry Eustachy** - Won Iowa State’s only Big 12 titles. AP National Coach of the Year. 2 time Big 12 Coach of the Year. Took Iowa State to the Elite Eight. Holds record for most games won in a season at 32. [Holds the record for longest home winning streak at 39 games.](http://www.cyclones.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10700&amp;ATCLID=205823409) He resigned in 2003 after pictures surfaced of him drinking and partying at Kansas State and Mizzou. It is widely believed that our AD at the time forced him to resign instead of letting him go through rehab for his alcohol problem. Most fans resented this about the AD since we promoted from within to a guy who couldn’t coach. Who was that AD? The [same guy](http://www.sportingnews.com/ncaa-football/story/2013-06-27/louisiana-tech-ad-resigning-bruce-van-de-velde-bowl-snafu-stepping-down) who couldn’t get 9-3 Louisana Tech into a bowl game.      
* **Johnny Orr** - Orr came to Iowa State via Michigan in 1980. The Iowa State AD wanted to hire one of Orr’s assistants but once learning how much Iowa State was going to pay he took the job instead. The man responsible for Hilton Magic. [Holds the 2 through 4 spots of longest home winning streaks at 22
He also did a lot of awesome things while at Iowa State. [Like reminding Vitale that he kicked Vitale’s ass in the last game he coached
* **Louis Menze** - Prominent coach in Iowa State basketball history for winning 4 conference titles and taking Iowa State to its only Final Four.

*Basketball Traditions*     
***       

* [**Hilton Magic**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilton_Coliseum#Hilton_Magic) - The Magic is the power of the Cyclones to pull off amazing upsets. It was first coined on 14 Feb 1989 when a Des Moine Register writer covered the upset over then #3 Mizzou with a packed coliseum. The writer called for more magic, steel doors, and close seating, the crowd is often one of the largest and loudest in CBB, helping the team to attain some of the longest home win streaks in the nation.     

* [**Cyclone Alley**](http://www.cyclonealley.org/) - The name for the student section. A committee run giveaways and coordinate other stuff for the other students. The students take up the entire strip from behind both boards, crazy costumes, and the occasional dance fad. - [1](http://i.imgur.com/NXypFdd.jpg) - [2](http://i.imgur.com/eXGOWcW.jpg) - [Giant Niang](http://i.imgur.com/6SIy4Wp.jpg) - [Harlem Shake ^^*sigh*](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2maaprwncgw)

*What Is and What is to Come*

Heading into the 2012-13 season I had high hopes just as every year, I thought they just weren't in the same league as Indiana, Michigan, or Louisville. Then when Ryan Kelly went out I was certainly worried.


Duke struggled at times with Kelly out

After a poor showing in the ACC tournament Duke moved into the NCAA tournament easily the most challenging region in the bracket with teams such as Oregon at a 12 seed. After a great win against Michigan State and Sparty it was time to rematch Lousiville. Of course Duke had beaten Louisville earlier in the year at the Battle for Atlantis but this time they had Dieng back. Basically everyone saw that game which was brutal to watch for any Duke fan or fan in general in regards to Kevin Ware. Congrats to Louisville

***

Looking ahead to the 2013-14 season, and Hood all doing tons of ball pressuring which will add an interesting and new element to the Duke basketball culture seeing as how Duke hasn't been the most athletic team lately. This defensive pressure mixed with one of the most explosive offensives on paper in the NCAA and I believe that Duke should be a serious threat, maybe THE favorite, to win it all next year.

I think many people should be excited to see Rodney Hood [(Small video here of him)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PccUhgjv-k8). It was talked about often last year among the Duke community that he was the most talented player on that team without contest. Coach Wojo said in an interview that there was no player like him in the country and that he was a superstar ready to explode onto the scene. The kid has a great lefty stroke and is very, that Duke has the best wing trio in the country. Here's to hoping for a successful season in the new ACC and ring number 5 for Coach K...

**Greatest Games** 

[NC State 103 Maryland 100 OT 1974 ACC Championship game](http://home.earthlink.net/~charlottewolf/greatest_college_basketball_game.htm) 

Many dubbed this as the greatest game ever played at that time. Back when conferences could only send 1 team to the NCAA tournament and the ACC had 4 teams in the top 10 that year. NC State and Maryland were both ranked in the top 4 or 5 almost all year

[NC State 80 UCLA 77 2 OT 1974 Final 4](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1088398/)

What many viewed as the title game that year. I bet most people other than State and Marquette fans even know that NC State beat Marquette in the final. Most people I know assume we beat UCLA that year in the final

[NC State 52 Houston 50

One of biggest upsets in NCAA history. Similar to our 1974 semifinal with UCLA, desperately searching for someone to hug, doesn't make you smile, then i'm not sure what will.

[NC State 69 Pepperdine 67 2 OT NCAA 1st round](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VDMjFQ-Kjsk) 
NC State came back from a 8 pt deficit with under a minute to go

**Greatest Players:**

[David ""Skywalker"" Thompson 1972-1975](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Thompson_(basketball))

Greatest Player in NC State history. One of the best in NCAA history. 1st overall pick in 1975 NBA draft. If his career weren't derailed by his addiction problems he would likely have gone down as one of the greatest in the NBA as well. Many believe that the obsession and measuring of vertical leap in the NBA began because of him. [Video discussing his jumping](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQPVKQIFxVk)

[Dereck Whittenburg 1979-1983](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dereck_Whittenburg)

Mr. Clutch on the 1983 title team. whenever the team needed a clutch basket

[Chris Corchiani 1988-1991](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Corchiani)

The ""fire"" of the ""fire and ice"" backcourt with Rodney Monroe. He was a sparkplug of the later Valvano teams

Other Notable players: Dick Dickey, Thurl Bailey, Sidney Lowe, Rodney Monroe, Tom Gugliotta, Julius Hodge

**Greatest Coaches**[Everett Case 1946-1964](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everett_Case)

One of the founding father's of ACC basketball. He is often credited with the rise in popularity of basketball in North Carolina. He is also credited with starting practices such as cutting down the nets after winning a championship, and was inducted into the basketball hall of fame in 1982. Legend has it that he asked to be buried facing Highway 70, so that he could cheer on the Wolfpack as they travelled down the road towards Durham and Chapel Hill.

[Norm Sloan 1966-1980](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_Sloan)

Took NC State to new heights, 1973, and 1974. Known as ""Stormin Norman"" for his legendary battles with Dean Smith at UNC and Lefty Driesell at Maryland. Also legendary for his [famous sportscoat](http://farm4.staticflickr.com/3015/2289099742_d35eeca80a_z.jpg). He was famous for never signing a contract with NC State. At the end of every season he walked into the AD's office and asked him if they were on for another year. Upon finding out that he was earning far less than rivals Smith and Driesell he began disputing with the AD, and ultimately resigned and began coaching at Florida. his resignation ultimately led to us hiring...

[Jim Valvano 1980-1990](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Valvano)

Jimmy V. The one and only. Had one of the largest personalities I can rfemember in College coaching. Famous not only for winning the 1983 NCAA title

**Greatest Rivalries**

*NC State vs UNC* In recent years this has been more fierce on the football field

*NC State vs Duke* A rivalry borne mostly out of proximity and a mutual hatred of UNC. There is a rivalry none the less. Going back to Norm Sloan and Vic Bubas. They were college teammates at NC State

*What is and What is to come*
***
For many the 2012-2013 season was a bitter disappointment. A season that began with so much hope and so much promise ended suddenly in the 1st round of the NCAA tournament. It speaks to how quickly we have started to get back on our feet after some down times, who constantly amazed the ACC with his effort, tenacity, and outstanding rebounding, it's difficult to pick out any other NC State player and say that they improved from 2011 to now. Leslie and Brown seemed to have stagnated in their growth, or even regressed. Scott Wood has always been a great shooter, but never was able to add much else to his game. Rodney Purvis didn't really live up to the expectations that were laid on him as he got to campus. There were some highs,000 point scorers on the team at the same time (Wood

The 2013-14 season will see a new beginning and a new era in Raleigh. 5 of our top 6 players from last season are now gone, and Rodney Purvis transferring. NC State adds a good recruiting class led by MCD's all-american Anthony ""Cat"" Barber to pair with good returners Tyler Lewis and TJ Warren. TJ Warren will be asked to shoulder much of the scoring load this season, as most of the points from last year are gone, but scoring is something that he is particularly adept at. Tyler Lewis and Cat Barber will give us our PG play, and LSU transfer Ralston Turner and JUCo pickup Desmond Lee will add to Warren on the wings. A trio of freshman will pair with senior benchwarmer extraordinaire Jordan vandenberg, 4 star recruits BeeJay Anya and Kyle Washington, and 3 star Lennard Freeman. This season should be an interesting one for the Wolfpack, but there is certainly talent there if they are able to figure it out.

We need to talk.

Despite having a very large response to the request for pollsters we've had a HUGE drop-off. To put it into context

So the first part of this is to seek input. Is there something about the format pollsters are finding impossible to work with? Currently the poll is open from Wednesday night through Friday. The reason for this was to incorporate more games than the 'official' polls so ours were always different. The release would also give us something to discuss on Fridays (usually our sports slowest day). Is that what is causing the problem?

Second

Pollsters

Lastly; if anyone would like to participate and will actually do a ballot every week please send me a PM. Depending on how this thread goes I'm considering dropping anyone who has missed more than one ballot at this point.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Well, our Women's basketball team shocked the world by defeating Brittney Griner and Baylor en route to the National Championship game, our football team overcame the odds and the doubters to defeat Florida in the Sugar Bowl, and our baseball team reached the College World Series for the second time. It's been a great year to be a Louisville Cardinal, but rather than become complacent and satisfied with our many accomplishments this year, we should look to compound our achievements and build our school and programs into a national standard. Looking forward, going from National Champions to being in the lowly interim American Athletic Conference is a pretty big let-down, we are extremely excited to face the great competition the ACC will provide us! I'm certain our players and fans see a bright future ahead of us!

*Random Trivia*
***
* EMBRACE THE PACE: UVa plays one of the slowest paces in the country, “giving up good looks for great looks”, even if it means using all of the shot clock.
* Defense, pioneered by his father Dick Bennett at Wisconsin. The pack line is a sagging man to man defense where the off ball defenders sag into the imaginary “pack line” about 3-5 feet inside the 3 point line, denying penetration and forcing contested outside shots. Defense comes first for Bennett, always, and we’ve seen the transfer of several players not seeing the floor because they couldn’t grasp the defensive concepts.
* Both of those combine to make UVa one of the most “ugly” playing teams in the country, and every single shot has to be earned by the opposing team. Defense is beautiful.
* Tony Bennett still holds the All Time NCAA 3 point % record from his playing days at UW-Green Bay. He shot 49.7% for his career from 3.
* Thomas Jefferson only requested 3 of his many achievements be included on his gravestone; Author of the Declaration of Independence and Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom
* UVA has been the #1 or #2 ranked public university every year since the rankings started and is currently the 24th best overall college in the country

***
*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Depending on who you ask, a NCAA bubble team, and ended up losing to the eventual NIT champs in the quarter final. The highs were tremendously high, with signature wins over #3 Duke, UNC, #18 NC State, and @Wisconsin, @BC

We head into 2013-14 with 2 legitimate All-ACC caliber players (Sr. Joe Harris and Sr. Akil Mitchell), very good. We also have one of the deepest teams in UVa history with considerable playable depth at every position, and 12 scholarship players ready to contribute. The only large question mark is who emerges at PG out of the 4 options we have. Here’s how I see our lineup shaking out. PG- RSo Malcolm Brogdon, SG- Sr. Joe Harris, SF- So. Justin Anderson, PF- Sr. Akil Mitchell, C- So. Mike Tobey. This would put our 5 best players on the court, lanky, F- So. Evan Nolte, G- Fr. Devon Hall. Brogdon can also play the 2 so it’s possible either Jones

All in all, the system is in place, and everyone that’s left has bought in. After making the NCAA tournament in 2011-12, and a deep-ish NIT run in 2012-13, anything short of a NCAA Sweet 16 would be a disappointment. We’ve seen UVA compete at a high level for the past 2 years, albeit somewhat inconsistently, but now it’s time to see whether we can take the next step into the national spotlight.

Basically I used then used Kenpom's formula for calculating the chances of any given match-up by substituting each teams power score into this equations: (A-A*B)/(A+B-2*A*B).

To be clear

The formula accounts for each round and factors in the chances of even *making* that round due to previous round percentages. It's a lot of work to make the whole bracket in a readable format but if this is upvoted enough and there is a enough interest I'll do that for you guys. Anyways

*Edit: I've started adding some image links of the brackets...not easy to read but at least you can all see the full results. The percentages denote the team's chances of winning the round in question.*

National Championships: 1 (1941)



**History**

*The Good Old Glory Days*

   As you can tell by the years of our conference championships, as we had back to back undefeated seasons in 1912-1913 and 1913-1914, led by our head coach Dr. James C Elsom. More than half of Wisconsin’s Big Ten championships came before 1930, showing not only how strong we were in this time, but also how weak the program would become. 
But not yet! In 1934, in 1941, he led us to our first and only national championship, beating Washington State 39-34 in the title game (and what a beautiful score that is!). 
The Dark Ages

   Now, but only returned to the NCAA tournament once (1947). The records during the rest of his tenure were utterly uninspiring as well, but it gets worse. Between 1959 and 1995, the Badgers only had 8 winning seasons (and only 4 winning Big Ten records). Needless to say, this was the dark period of our program. A few NIT appearances and a return to the NCAA tournament in 1994 helped end it, but our program was still not considered a power by any stretch of the imagination.

*Something Good Brewing*

   In 1995

   As an 8 seed in the 2000 NCAA tournament, the first time they would get out of the first weekend since the Bud Foster era. Notching wins against #4 LSU and #6 Purdue would send the Badgers to the Final Four, where they fell to #1 Michigan State, 53 – 41. Despite the disappointing ending, this run would spark the Badger basketball program and propel them into the new century. 

   The next year, an assistant coach, who would help get us to the tournament once again. However, after the season, Soderberg was let go and the University of Wisconsin made the best move of its history and hired Bo Ryan. 

*Bo Knows*

   For those unaware, a D III school in southern Wisconsin. While at UW – Platteville, Ryan won the D III championship 4 times. As head coach, Bo Ryan kept the energy from the recent success and turned it into consistent success, something that hadn’t been seen in the modern era of college basketball. Bo Ryan has had 20 win seasons all but once, and has never failed to fall outside of the top 4 of the Big Ten, despite the depth of the conference. He has also never missed the NCAA tournament
Aside from his success in reaching the tournament, Jon Leuer, and many more, Bo Ryan’s time here has been nothing short of amazing and despite the lack of tournament success he has left a positive mark on Wisconsin basketball and will continue to do so. 



**2012 – 2013 Season**


   Last season started out a bit rocky. Losing returning PG Josh Gasser in the off season left us with only Ben Brust at the guard position with any experience, vs. Creighton, at Marquette, and most surprisingly, at home against Virginia (Bo Ryan’s first loss to an unranked team at home) were all hard on the team and added extra concern about the conference schedule, as the Big Ten schedule appeared to be a deadly gauntlet. 
   
   However, including wins against #12 Illinois and at #2 Indiana. A tough stretch would bring the Badgers into a home matchup against #3 Michigan, where [Ben Brust](http://cdn.gifbay.com/2013/02/incredible_half_court_shot_by_wisconsins_ben_brust_to_force_ot_vs_michigan-32126.gif) would save us and give us a solid win and some momentum to end the season. 

   Unfortunately, offensive inconsistency, which had plagued the Badgers all season, was on display for the whole country to see, as the Badgers lost 58-43, a score that makes it seem closer than it actually was. A win against Penn State kind of made up for those losses and was a hopeful sign of getting ready for the conference tournament. 
The Badgers were the #4 seed in the Big Ten Tournament, the #5 seed. The Badgers would win after an ugly first half by scoring 51 points in the second half. Their next game would be against #1 Indiana, where the Badgers would win as well, securing their 12th victory against Indiana in a row. However, the title was not meant to be, as #2 Ohio State would beat them in the final game. 

The promising season that had several bright moments and full of hope would then end in a thud in the big dance. 12 seed Ole Miss would win 57-46 against the 5 seed Badgers in another performance plagued by cold streaks on offense. 

*The Future*

Despite losing 3 starters, but Traevon Jackson and George Marshall contributing in big ways and growing throughout the season. Bronson Koenig, a big time recruit from Milwaukee, may also have the chance to contribute at the point guard position. Sam Dekker also emerged as a stud and will have many opportunities to be a team leader as he gains a starting spot on the roster, hoping to replace the production that Mike Breuesewitz and Ryan Evans had. Frank Kaminsky will also hope to fill the role of Jared Berggren’s role of the big man down under the basket.


 
**Style**

With the hiring of Bo Ryan,” but its beauty lies in how well it works at frustrating opponents. 

On offense, but will wait until there is a good shot. This causes them to use up the shot clock in a way few other teams do consistently, but is helpful in tiring the opponents out by playing long sets on defense. 

The Badger’s defensive game is all about helping out and a focus on teamwork. There are very rarely flashy blocks or high energy steals, low scoring games.

The Terps opened play in Comcast Center in October 2002, the majority of student seating is in a 4,000 seat section behind one of the baskets known simply as “The Wall.” That section gets filled with signs and big heads during the second half, when the opponents shoot at the basket in front of it. 

Students also are permitted to sit along both sidelines in court-level seating and in a small section behind the other basket. It is generally regarded as one of the toughest places to play in college basketball

**[Record: 25-13 \(8-10 ACC\)](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/teams/schedule/MD/maryland-terrapins)**  
**[Roster](http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/teams/roster/MD/maryland-terrapins)**  
Head Coach: Mark Turgeon
Assistant Coaches: Bino Ranson (3rd season)

**Key Players**  
**[Alex Len
Len entered his sophomore year at Maryland as a projected lottery pick, but fostered questions about his ability to stick in the NBA long-term.

Little was known about the center before he came to Maryland in 2011; expected to be a prototypical European center (early scouting reports talked more of his jump-shooting ability

Len played his biggest game of the season in Maryland’s first game of the season

Unfortunately, averaging 11.9 points and 7.8 rebounds for the Terps. 

Part of the reason for that inconsistent play may have been a stress fracture he suffered in his left ankle at some point during the season. Len said in an interview with Grantland last week that he played “half the season” with the injury

Still

**[Dezmine “Dez” Wells
Wells went from out of college basketball to College Park to Maryland’s best player all in the span of a few short months. Kicked out of Xavier over a sexual assault allegation in August, Wells chose Maryland, and was declared eligible for the 2012-13 season in November.

Wells quickly became Maryland’s most important player, which also led the team.
After getting off to an ugly start to the season against Kentucky, Wells’ career-high 30 points helped Maryland beat Duke for the second time this season. With Alex Len gone, Wells will return to College Park as Maryland’s most talented player in the 2013-14 season.

**[Nick Faust
Much like Wells, 3.7 rebounds, and 2.5 assists--it’s a sign of the versatility that Maryland so desperately needed in its lineup this year. 

Faust’s best game came against Clemson, Faust was key in Maryland’s near-upset of North Carolina, scoring 17 points in the loss. He also came up big in Maryland’s NIT run, tallying 15 points and 11 rebounds in the opener against Niagara. He was the primary reason why Maryland was able to keep their semifinal matchup with Iowa close, scoring 14 points in the season-ending loss. 

Honorable Mention: Seth Allen

**Biggest Moments**  

**[Topping #14 N.C. State 51-50: January 16
Maryland opened the game against the Wolfpack on a 10-0 run and held N.C. State to just 16 first-half points

**[Maryland Beats Duke
Despite playing one of their sloppiest games of the year (Maryland turned the ball over 26 times in the game), but his two free throws with 2.8 seconds left were the most important points he scored, icing the game for the Terps.

**[Maryland Beats Duke
Maryland entered the ACC Tournament knowing it needed to win the tournament or at least make the final to have any hope of making the NCAA Tournament after an ugly stretch after their first win over Duke derailed their chances. After beating Wake Forest in the first round, while four other Terrapins pitched in 10 points apiece. Maryland led the entire game, and Duke shot just 4-of-25 from behind the three-point line in the loss--their worst performance of the season. Maryland would lose to North Carolina narrowly in the ACC semifinals, ending their tournament chances. Maryland became the first team since the 2005 Terrapins to beat Duke twice and miss the NCAA Tournament.

Honorable Mention: vs. Kentucky (loss), at Alabama (win)

**[Schedule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2013%E2%80%9314_Maryland_Terrapins_men%27s_basketball_team#Schedule_and_Results)**   
While the full schedule hasn’t been set yet, and a road game against Ohio State in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge. The Terps will also participate in the Paradise Jam Tournament in the Virgin Islands and will play in the BB&amp;T Classic against George Washington despite rumors that Maryland would walk away from the event.

Maryland’s ACC opponents in their final season in the conference include home games against conference champion Miami and new conference members Notre Dame, UNC, and N.C. State, but none of those teams will make return trips to College Park--a supposed slight against Maryland for leaving the conference.

**The Greats**  

**Greatest Games**  

**1974 ACC Tournament Final vs. NC State**  
Although the Terps lost to NC State 103-100 in overtime (to a Wolfpack team that eventually won the national championship), so this game was instrumental in expanding the tournament to include at-large teams. The 1974 team is considered to be the best team to not make the tournament, as Maryland boasted six future draft picks, including first-rounders John Lucas, Len Elmore, and Tom McMillen.

**[1986 vs. North Carolina](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5KdFhvX8Xaw)**  
Behind 36 points from Len Bias, when he stole an inbounds pass and finished with a reverse slam dunk, one of the lasting images of his short life.

**[2002 vs. Duke](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T2UUyAzKLMg)**  
Playing their final game in Cole Field House against Duke

**2002 NCAA Tournament Final vs. Indiana**  
Maryland won their first NCAA championship behind 18 points from Juan Dixon. Down 44-42 with 9:52 remaining, Dixon, Steve Blake, and Chris Wilcox. Head coach Gary Williams became the first alumnus to coach his school to the national title since Norm Sloan at North Carolina State in 1974.

**[2003 NCAA Tournament First Round vs. UNC-Wilmington](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=EAMNgPo5-gc#t=104s)**  
In danger of losing in the first round a year after winning the national championship

**[2010 vs. Georgia Tech](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aD0S6wR6K9Y)**  
In one of the weirdest finishes ever (and one I witnessed), Cliff Tucker hit a three pointer over Glen Rice Jr. to beat a Yellow Jackets team boasting Derrick Favors and Iman Shumpert.

**Greatest Players**  
Len Elmore: Maryland’s all-time leading rebounder

John Lucas: Lucas was a two-time All-American

Len Bias: A two-time All-American, less than 48 hours before he died of a cocaine overdose.

Juan Dixon: Dixon was the 2002 NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player

**Why:** Because it's the off season.

**Where:** You can vote [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1JKDgRI8nzOJEZsxlXF-CZtPYdvd3H1dcDkV3yJAXch4/viewform). You can see the full bracket [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/pub?key=0AirJNpGeqx8ndEt6SWJoWnhWdEU3a3czYi1JS1NkRlE&amp;single=true&amp;gid=0&amp;output=html).

**When:** Voting will remain open until May 15th at 12:00pm Central.

**Other FAQs**

- *Your seeding sucks.*

No

- *Why isn't my favorite GIF included?*

Only GIFs that met the following criteria were considered:

- The event took place during the 2012-2013 NCAA basketball season. So an awesome GIF like [this](http://goo.gl/Ohp6m)? Ineligible because it happened last year.
- The event is more than just a SportsCenter highlight play. So an awesome GIF like [this](http://goo.gl/zCfFU)? Ineligible because it's just a top play.
- The GIF isn't heavily edited. So an awesome GIF like [this](http://goo.gl/J2AFB)? Ineligible because it's more about the author's creativity than the actual moment.

It's also possible that we missed something. In that case

- *Can I vote more than once?*

We don't care. If winning a GIF Tournament is a big enough deal for you that you try to stuff the ballot box, they're talking about you.

- *How is the bracket scored?*

We'll take the average score for each GIF. Higher score wins in each matchup. If two GIFs have an identical average score, we'll flip a coin.

- *Where'd you find these GIFs?*

Most of them came from user submissions here. Some of them also came from websites that like to post a lot of GIFs. These include, [Bleacher Report](http://bleacherreport.com/), [College Hoops Journal](http://www.collegehoopsjournal.com/), and [Tumblr](http://www.tumblr.com/).

- *Who won the actual March Madness pool?*

Gah...we know. We're lame. And late. Tallying some of the more unique prize categories has been more difficult and time consuming than we expected. We'll have an announcement and distribute prizes shortly.",,t5_2rj3j,False,modpost,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/CollegeBasketball/comments/1dxqvn/rcollegebasketball_20122013_gif_madness/

* Down The Drive – A cheer we do during timeouts, but [this video of a football game](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8DYLz3-Cjuo) should give you the basic idea. It’s kinda cheesy, but when you have 13,000+ in a packed arena doing it, it really does sound cool.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
Heading into the 2012-13 season, but lost 2 important seniors. I was pretty surprised when we were able to bolt out of the gate in ‘12-‘13 and climb all the way to #8 in the nation.

However, it was streetball. If you’ve ever played basketball in your driveway, you’ve used our 2012-13 offensive system. For the love of god, it was horrible to watch. I truly believe we could’ve repeated our Sweet 16 run if we had a shred of an offensive gameplan. That has to be the #1 priority for Coach Mick Cronin headed into next season.

Looking ahead to the 2013-14 season, including 5* PF Jermaine Lawrence. I expect Kilpatrick to average somewhere between 18-23 points, with some of the freshmen getting some serious minutes. It’ll be fun to watch.

Given all the new meat, given the switch to the AAC. Most experts have us as a fringe tourney team, and I think that’s pretty fair. I think it’s safe to say we’ll make the tournament, but we could fare much better or much worse, depending on how the freshmen play.

***

**EDIT 2:** I forgot to mention something! I'm actually still missing scores and opponents for a handful of games that were played in the early '80s. All missing scores were of games against non-Division I opponents. I have not been able to track down complete schedules for the following schools/seasons:

* Baltimore
* Grambling State
* Jackson State
* US International

Just yesterday, though. The [NCAA's online statistics archive](http://web1.ncaa.org/stats/StatsSrv/careersearch) doesn't have records for any of the above schools/seasons, and they don't have *any* records at all for Baltimore or USIU. LexisNexis hasn't turned up those records, either. I've called the SID offices at both Grambling and Jackson State, but neither of them ever called me back. I have *Street and Smith* annuals for almost every year going back to 1981-82, but that one doesn't include the JSU or USIU schedules (both had just moved up to Division I), and I'm missing the 1979-80 and 1983-84 editions.

If any of you fine folks can fill in those gaps

***

**EDIT 3:** Corrected a minor error in the bottom 25.

***

About two months ago

http://www.reddit.com/r/CFB/comments/17y5ft/40_years_of_college_football_cfb_program_rankings/

Several people asked if I'd done something similar with basketball. I wasn't quite done with my basketball data at that time

**Just to be clear

So this here is a 40-year overall program ranking. For every program

Some interesting notes:

* The highest ranked team with a losing overall record is Washington State.
* The lowest ranked team with a winning overall record is South Dakota. They have only been Division I for five seasons
* The highest ranked team that no longer plays Division I basketball is Birmingham Southern
* The most recent school to drop its entire athletics program is Morris Brown, and Baltimore (1982-83).
* The lowest ranked team that has been Division I for all 40 years under consideration is New Hampshire

This list includes the top 100 and the bottom 25 only. If the ""seasons"" column is blank

[Butler-IU, March 26, 2011](http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/basketball/ncaa/men/gameflash/2011/03/26/70992_recap.html) Butler fans know that Florida has always been our NCAA giant, beating us in the first round in 2000, and in the Sweet 16 in 2007(on their way to their 2nd national championship).  That made coming back to win this game that much sweeter.  Of course, Butler has nothing for respect for Florida, as the Stevens, told him that “you out-coached me”.

*What Is and What is to Come*
***
This is going to be an interesting year for Butler.  It’s our first year in the new Big East, 2 walk ons), it’s going to be a young team with a young new coach.  As much as I’d like to tell you Butler will be fine and keep making it into the NCAA, I can’t honestly say that.  But I can say I have faith in Barry picking Brandon Miller, as he was the man to pick Brad to replace Todd Licklitter.  I’m hoping for a &gt;.500% season in the new BE, and a trip to the NCAA at least.

[**Greatest Coaches:**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_Mexico_Lobos_men's_basketball#Coaching_records)

Bob King (1962-72): The reason The Pit was built 37 years ago and the reason Lobo basketball has its unbelievable following is because of this man...from 1900-62, the Lobos never won more than seven games in a season...since that time, UNM has only had three losing seasons in the past 40 years...Lobomania was set in motion by Bob King and his early teams that played in Johnson Gym...their success created the need for a bigger arena, which came to life for the first time on Dec. 1, 1966...26 years later, the floor was appropriately named Bob King Court for the man who got it all started for New Mexico basketball. Record: 175-89

Norm Ellenberger (1972-79): Arguably the most controversial coach in Lobo Basketball, payments made for bogus junior-college credits to keep players eligible, and other devices permitting individuals entirely lacking academic credentials to be represented as college students while playing on Ellenberger's team. The episode began with an FBI wiretap on the phone of a prominent Lobo booster, recording a conversation in which Ellenberger arranged with assistant coach Manny Goldstein to transfer bogus credits from a California junior college to the office of the UNM registrar. Subsequent investigation turned up a manufactured college seal from Mercer County Community College in New Jersey, along with blank transcripts and an extensive record of previous forgery, and was found a few years later with 57 rule violations, and Ellenberger himself was convicted on 21 counts of fraud. Record: 134-62

Dave Bliss (1988-99): Dave Bliss brought the Lobos back to a solid program. He took the team to the NCAA tournament six of his last seven seasons, and the team reached the NCAA tournament all four seasons. Record: 246-108

Steve Alford (2007-13): Alford began his coaching career with the Lobos with the best season they’d seen since Dave Bliss

**Greatest Rivalries:** The Rio Grande Rivalry- A series between The University of New Mexico and New Mexico State University that encompasses sports for both programs. The Rio Grande Rivalry officially started and was recognized beginning in the 2007-08 academic year. It is a rivalry unmatched by few and it dates back to the early days. The first competition began with football on January 1, 1904. The rivalry between the two schools began before the territory of New Mexico became a state in 1912.

One who’s a fan also can’t go without mentioning the growing rivalry happening with UNM-UNLV and UNM-SDSU

*What Is and What is to Come*

***

The 2012-2013 season was a very interesting ride for Lobo fans to say the least. Towards the beginning of the year, and names like Kendall Williams and Tony Snell stepped up in pivotal moments in order to give the Lobos a winning season. Cameron Bairstow also stepped up to create a new High-Low game that the Lobos hadn’t had previously. They ended the regular season with a 26-5 record, and cruised to win the Mountain West Tournament. The Lobos ended up in the NCAA Tournament with a 3 seed, with many debating if that was too low or too high, and busted many brackets when they lost to Harvard in the second round.

Looking forward to the 2013-2014 season, Chad Adams who rotated with the big men, and Tony Snell, who left for the NBA, the Lobos will once again need a player to step up and play a “star” type of role. Also, the Lobos will face a change in their coaching, as Steve Alford transferred to UCLA, Noodles ran the offense, which will toughen the team early on. Good things should be expected

Also notable as of current, finally, Tony Snell was selected 20th overall to play for the Chicago Bulls. To say that lots are expected here after these events would be an understatement.

**KANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY**

*Proud members of the Big 12 Conference*

**Year Founded:** 1863. Kansas State is celebrating it's sesquicentennial this year.

**Location:** Manhattan

**Current Enrollment:** 24, and 3,885 postgraduates)


**Mascot:** [Willie the Wildcat.](http://fantanistazone.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Willie-the-Wildcat.jpg) 

Willie will dress for whatever sporting event he is at, and a [baseball game](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7a/WillietheWildcat002.JPG). He has also been known to break out a tuxedo on special occasions. 

Willie's identity is traditionally kept secret.

Some older pictures of Willie: [1](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/interactivity/images/babyjay_resize.jpg) [2](http://www.k-state.edu/images/home/gallery/willie.jpg)

**[Fight Song:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuhM0QcR_-M)** Composed in 1927

Go fight
For Alma Mater fight (Fight! Fight! Fight!)    
Glory in the combat    
For the purple and the white
Faithful to our colors
We shall ever be
Fighting
Go State!

From 1950 until 1989, and one of the largest in the country. Ahearn's monstrous home court advantage helped the Wildcats earn a 369-96 (.793) record there. Ahearn is still standing today, and is used for Volleyball games, indoor Track and Field meets, and various university functions.

**[Wabash Cannonball:](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aiWiNSw7o1c)** On December 13, which at the time was the home of the Music Department. Every piece of music in the band's library was lost, except for an arrangement of Wabash Cannonball which the band director had brought home that night to work on. The band played it at a basketball game three days later, and the song quickly became very popular. It would go on to become K-State's second, unofficial fight song. When played, fans will rock their bodies back and forth, alternating with the people around them. [This looks really cool when large groups of people do it](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUjQ39eTQbk). It is a bit of a workout.

**[Alma Mater](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BvNJRoPQKSQ#t=5m40s)**

(The timestamp I put in here doesn't seem to be working. Skip to 5:40 for the Alma Mater)

The alma mater, who graduated from KSU in the class of 1888. Whenever the Alma Mater is performed by the band, students and alumni will sway back and forth, arms wrapped around each other's shoulders, and sing along. Win or lose, the band will play this at the end of every football and basketball game.

I know a spot that I love full well
'Tis not in forest
Ever it holds me with magic spell
I think of thee
K-S-U
K-S-U
Loyal to thee
Hail, Alma Mater.    

Fun Fact: Our Alma Mater was written when we were the Kansas State Agricultural College

K-S-A-C
K-S-A-C

**[K-S-U Chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ChcvGzi_ScM)**

Willie the Wildcat will lead the crowd in the K-S-U chant before each game

**Starting lineup**

Students will rustle newspapers when the opposing team's starting lineup is introduced. After each name is read off, Who's He, So What, and Go Home. They will then tear up the newspapers, and toss them into the air when our team is introduced.

**[Tunnel Dance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fM_eL0qK8rQ)**

Before each game

**EMAW**

A slogan that stands for Every Man a Wildcat. It symbolizes that one is part of the Wildcat nation, or [spray paint onto billboards](http://www.thewizofodds.com/.a/6a00e553e551d18834011278d6dfbf28a4-500wi).

Recently, since EMAW is sexist and excludes women. Most students disagree, saying that EMAW is not meant to exclude women, that ""man"" in this context refers to both men and women. Neil Armstrong did not mean to exclude women when he said ""That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind,"" for example. The University has stopped using EMAW in any official capacity out of a desire to not appear sexist, but it is still very popular with students.

* **[Nichols Hall](http://www.k-state.edu/maps/buildings/N/n.jpg)**: Currently home to the Computer Science and Theatre departments. Nichols used to be a gymnasium, and during 1968, [there was a fire there that destroyed most of the band's music](http://www.cis.ksu.edu/system/files/nichols_fire_4.jpg). The only piece of music that survived was an arrangement of Wabash Cannonball, which the band played at a basketball game three days later. The fans loved it, and it became our secondary fight song 

**Local Dining** (Disclaimer: I rarely eat out in Manhattan

There are several great bars and restaurants in [Aggieville](http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_tb2K7ob45E4/TQnUbEcSF1I/AAAAAAAAouY/hA0EsU3lmyM/s1600/StreetOfAggieville.jpg)

* So Long Saloon: Has great burgers. So Long Saloon is tiny

* Hunam Express: Some of the best chinese takeout I think I've ever had.

* ~~Doughboy's Pizza: Best pizza I've had in Manhattan.~~ Apparently they've closed...

* Rusty's Last Chance: Country themed bar

* Call Hall: KSU's Animal Sciences and Industry Department sells (very good) ice cream in Call Hall

* Kite's Bar and Grill

* Big D's Burger Shack

* Pizza Shuttle: Pretty good cream cheese pizzas. I'm fairly certain their business model is based mostly on being open late and and being across the street from the Engineering dorms. It's common practice here to do a ""Shuttle Drop

Other local restaurants and bars

* The Chef: Between The Buenos Dias Frittata (named best breakfast in Kansas), which are plate sized pancakes with anything you want added to them. They have an incredible atmosphere with awesome music and a huge selection of breakfast cocktails, if you're feeling frisky. Seriously. Go to The Chef.

* Bluestem Bistro: My favorite little coffee shop in the heart of Aggieville. They serve awesome coffee and specialty espresso drinks

* AJ's Pizza: Way better than Doughboys. They have their location near the mall on Poyntz

* Auntie Mae's: As for bars, where it remains to this day. This was and is THE bar for my friends and I. I haven't lived in Manhattan for over a year, and I still get waved through by the door guys. Their signature drinks are the tarantula, which is a version of a Long Island that will murder you; Moscow Mules, always on special; and $1.75 PBR and High Life cans.

* Rock a Belly Deli: If you are a beer person

* Aggie Station: Aggie Station makes a hell of a cocktail and has a clientele of older students and young graduates

*Random Trivia/Tidbits*

***

* Earl Woods

* The inventor of the snooze button was a K-State grad.

* [Eric Stonestreet, and occasionally speaks at pep rallies.

* [Kansas Wildcat March](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2egwk-eCH4): John Philip Sousa was a famous composer known for his marches, and The Washington Post. In October, 1928, John Philip Sousa was to make an appearance at K-State. A petition, signed by most of the student body, was presented to Sousa on October 10, requesting that he compose a Kansas State Agricultural College march. Two and a half years later, he sent the Music Department a piano arrangement of the Kansas Wildcat March. The marching band plays the march during the pregame show before football games

* Our basketball team is in the background of [this popular photo](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/302/170/685.png)

* During the 2012-2013 academic year, and baseball team all won at least a share of a conference title. Kansas State is one of four schools to accomplish this feat in the BCS era, along with Stanford, Texas, and Louisville. All three teams were predicted to finish in the bottom half of the Big 12 this last year.
