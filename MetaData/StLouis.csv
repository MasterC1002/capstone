Here's the information as posted on the [reddit gifts site](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/rstlouis-plays-board-games/)
&gt; We're going to play some board games! If you've been on our IRC chat room, where he invites people over for games and chat. The [first episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro) covers Small World. Other episodes cover Settlers of Catan, Zombie Dice, Tsuro, Get Bit... all fun games that are easy to learn and fun to play, and you get to play them with your fellow redditors!

&gt; **About our venue**: [Urban Eats](http://urbaneatscafe.com) is a local independent coffee shop in south St Louis City. They normally close at 8, they are asking for a minimum take of $500 (I'll basically be on the hook if there's a shortfall).  They do have a great menu (if you're having trouble viewing the Flash menu on their site, I do have a [PDF copy](http://timothy.org.uk/UrbanEatsMenu.pdf)). Beer, wine, cocktails and ""boozies"" (alcohol laden smoothies) are available, but this is NOT a 21-only venue, so those under 21 are very welcome. With 40+ people, so **if by August 3rd we do not have 40 RSVPs this event will be in danger of being cancelled.**

Here's the information as posted on the [reddit gifts site](http://redditgifts.com/meetups/rstlouis-plays-board-games/)
&gt; We're going to play some board games! If you've been on our IRC chat room, where he invites people over for games and chat. The [first episode](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9QtdiRJYro) covers Small World. Other episodes cover Settlers of Catan, Zombie Dice, Tsuro, Get Bit... all fun games that are easy to learn and fun to play, and you get to play them with your fellow redditors!

&gt; **About our venue**: [Urban Eats](http://urbaneatscafe.com) is a local independent coffee shop in south St Louis City. They normally close at 8, they are asking for a minimum take of $500 (I'll basically be on the hook if there's a shortfall).  They do have a great menu (if you're having trouble viewing the Flash menu on their site, I do have a [PDF copy](http://timothy.org.uk/UrbanEatsMenu.pdf)). Beer, wine, cocktails and ""boozies"" (alcohol laden smoothies) are available, but this is NOT a 21-only venue, so those under 21 are very welcome. With 40+ people, so **if by August 3rd we do not have 40 RSVPs this event will be in danger of being cancelled.**

Why in the Hell does Dobbs still exist? Has everyone forgotten the horrible red nightmare this place was and still is? They were on the local news for scamming and ripping customers off. I remember a traffic reporter going off on a rant while doing the traffic report. Dobbs tried to scam him

Here's my recent experience with Dobbs...

I took my car to Dobbs Tire &amp; Auto Center for an auto safety inspection, I was told my car had failed inspection for a bad upper taillight and that it would cost $20.00 to repair it. I informed the technician that I would buy my own bulb and replace it myself.  His tone went awkward upon hearing this. He paused, then said ok. He did not tell me that they had done any work on the car. After purchasing a light from Wal-mart for $3.89, my buddy and I return to Dobbs. Upon arrival we test the brake light to insure it was indeed defective. Sure enough, the brake light does not work, so we remove the cover for the bulb. We try to unseat the bulb from the socket and immediately discover the bulb will not come out. The bulb is stuck inside the housing, because it's too large for the hole to be removed. We then proceed to disassemble the housing, it's obvious that this is the wrong bulb for the socket and housing. Next, into the socket and test. It works perfectly. The new bulb also inserts perfectly into the hole in the housing

EDIT - I am confident this is a HUGE problem with all chain Auto Service centers. I price matched Midas to Car-X by 50.00. Instead of installing my new exhaust on springs and the proper hangers,,False,self,t5_2qpnm,1371234664.0,,True

On June 22, Phineas was confined in doggie jail. Written testimony from the boarding facility caring for him and submitted to the City states that he was anything but vicious. On March 22, 2013, Phineas was removed by Animal Control to an undisclosed location following issuance of an order by Judge Scott Bernstein of the Dent County Circuit Court. In that order, he stated: ""The Court finds that Phineas, the Labrador Retriever owned by the Plaintiffs is in fact a vicious dog as defined by Defendant's City Code under Section 5-15 in that Phineas without provocation on June 22nd, 2012 bit (minor child - name withheld.) The dog shall be humanely euthanized.""

* Soulard (I just have a bad feeling about it)

* The Science Center (It's been useless for a while)

* One of the thousands of hospitals (where do you think it spreads? Barnes might be okay just because it's so big)

* Highway 40 (too streamlined now; even a zombie could navigate it)

* Private Schools (not a lot of security)

* Metrolink/ Metrobus (could also get started there; unreliable)

* Monsanto (they’re probably the cause of the outbreak)

* Scott AFB Initially (It will be over run with people seeking refuge


Places to Go:

* Edward Jones Dome (not open air)

* Galleria or Mills Mall (beefed up security) (also, can I point out, a Cinnabon)

* Highway 70 (all the construction will confuse the zombies)

* Inner city schools (secure entrances and exits)

* The Rivers (zombies can't swim

* WashU (hear me out: the roofs are easy to sneak on and they're the perfect height for a sniper hideout)

* The Zoo (animals are immune to the zombie virus

* The Art or History Museum (nobody goes there, if you can get on top of the art museum you can shoot the zombies running up the hill)

* City Museum (more hiding places than the Magic House)

* A Cathedral or Church… just walk a block or two and you’ll find one (most zombies burst into flames when they enter churches. Some of the relics could be used as weapons)

* Lemp Mansion (the psyche of the zombie has taught it to steer clear. Also the non-PC Bubblehead School thingy)

* Crestwood mall

* Delmar Loop (it's where the zombies hang out already)


Things to remember:

* I don’t care if it’s the zombie of Stan Musial

* There are rumors that InBev took over AB because they knew Monsanto was producing a zombie gene and the only cure would be beer. So the brewery might be the ultimate weapon

* The further away from the city you get

* Escaping down the river should be our primary plan; however we might encounter more zombies and should stay prepared.

* Inner city schools will have food and lots of protection; private schools will have lot of good food but little protection. I.E. when you’re picking a school

* If the epicenter of the outbreak is Florida, a place not even zombies want to be.

* Bass Pro also has guns

* Blackblackbird noted that Barnes could be safe, a helipad, security officers with guns etc. I don't think they offered us help, but they said they have a special access card to fortify themselves...

* MrHacks also noted that St. Louis is home to the [Zombie Squad](http://zombiehunters.org)

* Hope you guys remember Boeing has a missile factory in st charles. Even though the ordinances are meant to be dropped/launched

What else should we add? I don’t know where we can procure weapons so that information is needed.

We took the Amtrak from Little Rock on a Friday night, and we could see the Arch from our room if we looked to the side!  After a nice, long hotel room nap, we went to the Cardinals/Rangers game that Saturday night (rain delay, but our seats were under an overhang; awesome night after the storm passed, except Cards lost).  We visited Union Station and the Zoo Sunday, City Museum Monday, but did the Museum of History and the Science Center).  Went up the Arch on Wednesday and then caught our return train that evening.  Also went to Laclede's Landing, but this will be a thing we do from time to time.  It's a great city

Highlights: City Museum knocked our socks off; my first trip to the *new* Busch Stadium and Junior's first MLB game ever: wonderful.  His favorite drink: Fitz's Root Beer Float; mine: Fitz's Root Beer Float (my second favorite: Schlafly Pale Ale).

**Some things I found:**

-St. Charles County is responsible for all the population growth of the last 20 years

-St. Louis County has remained almost completely stagnant in population since 1990

-There were more people in the city in 1877 than there are now

-The Black population of St. Louis is growing ~8x faster than the white population
geographically segregated 

-The number of areas with almost no black people (&lt;1.5%) has cut in half

-Certain areas downtown (CWE

-White people are leaving some areas of South City real fast

-St. Charles is growing to be less segregated than most of St. Louis County

-North City

-North City

-There are almost no minorities (meaning other than black or white in this case) in North City 

-I don't know what the hell happened in the area around Hamburg

OK, and it's not meant for actual scientific study. It's meant to sell books and magazines to the average person.


The biggest problem with how they report statistics is their use of arbitrary boundaries and borders, St. Louis would also look good in these rankings. This is why it is not an accurate representation of crime. Everyone knows statistics can be misleading. This is a perfect example.


So where can we get a more accurate statistical analysis? The FBI. That is a main focus of their job. They have hundreds of statisticians and criminologists, who needs more funding, and how to spend our tax dollars. That's why they want it as accurate as possible.


The FBI does not use a city's legal borders as a representation of a city. They use what they call ""Metropolitan Statistical Area"" to get a more accurate analysis. They try to get every region to report crime in a uniform matter,000. Chicago doesn't report numbers at all. St. Louis is pretty accurate in their reporting.


Now to what this is all leading up to- Where does St. Louis fall in all of this? How does it look comparing one metropolitan statistical area (MSA) to another? The answer is decent. Not outstanding, let's look at Walnut Park in north St. Louis. It has a high density of crime, but for the average citizen living in the MSA, there really isn't any reason to go there. There isn't a significant draw to the area, therefore, the crime that happens in Walnut Park is avoidable for most people in the MSA. In a city where crime is more evenly spread throughout, it is less avoidable. An extreme theoretical example is if half a city had an extreme crime problem, the latter half would be a perfectly safe place to live


**With the disclaimer out of the way,822,879. It's a pretty good, medium sized city when you take out the regional borders that local government has divided it up into. Also you might notice that 497 isn't too bad. To cherry-pick some numbers; Tampa, FL is 500, Charleston, SC is 513, MO is 541, PA is 605, AK is 812


**TL;DR**  The average St. Louisan believes their city to be extraordinarily awful due to piss-poor statistical reporting that doesn't reflect reality. This does more harm than we realize. St. Louis suburbanites are scared to death of the city, but St. Louis is closer to average than it is to ""Most Dangerous."" Below are links to the FBI website, so you can check it out yourself.

I am undergoing gynecomastia surgery (i.e.

I am new to St. Louis; I moved here in late August for school (Wash U). I have made a couple of friends

So

Firstly
760 Office Parkway 
Creve Coeur

I live on the Loop right next to Blueberry Hill. The distance is approximately 8 miles. My surgery should be finished at some point between 11AM and 12PM on November 2 (Friday).

Outpatient procedures prohibit me from leaving without adult accompaniment. I cannot take a taxi by myself. I need someone to take me home.

I'm a broke law school student, I might be able to pay for a taxi to pick you up, bring you to the surgical center, take us to my place, and then the taxi will take you to your place. (depending on the distances and expenses involved)

Also, and it'd be a bit... odd. (I'm a Wash U law student.)

Thank you for contacting me regarding cybersecurity.  I appreciate hearing from you and welcome the opportunity to respond.

The Internet has transformed the way our nation's industries and government operate, telecommunications, and energy grids, are now more interconnected than ever.  Observers commonly note that our nation has gone from ""network enabled"" to ""network dependent.""  As a result, we face an increased threat from cyber attacks that could have a devastating effect on the nation, impacting everything from our energy grid to the security of our financial institutions.

Every day, or invade privacy.  Hackers, domestic and foreign, overrun websites with so much Internet traffic that websites are forced to shut down, depriving users and subscribers from important online services.  Some cyber activity is related to espionage, as foreign governments try to steal secrets, access national security information, protecting our infrastructure systems from cyber threats has emerged as a top national security priority.

As you may know, President Obama signed an Executive Order aimed at bolstering cybersecurity protections for critical infrastructure networks by increasing information sharing between the government and private sector entities that run critical infrastructure networks.  The government will increase the volume, timeliness, and quality of cyber threat information shared with the private sector so that private sector entities can better protect themselves from cyber threats.  The Order also requires the federal government to draft voluntary cybersecurity standards. 

In addition, in the House of Representatives.  This bill would remove legal barriers that restrict information sharing between private sector companies and the federal government.  On April 18, 2013, CISPA was approved by the House of Representatives.  Should this legislation come to the Senate floor for a vote, I will be sure to keep your views in mind.

Our laws must be modernized to properly address the risks and the scope of cyber threats.  However, and government from cybersecurity threats without restricting growth and innovation, imposing unnecessary heavy-handed regulation, or threatening the civil liberties and privacy of individuals.  Any new requirements that Congress enacts must be flexible enough to ensure both the public and private sector can react quickly to new or unrealized threats.  Further, new regulatory requirements designed to address cyber threats cannot be allowed to simply become paperwork exercises for the regulated entities while contributing very little in the way of enhancing security.

In the past, in the Senate.  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to find commonsense, compromise solutions that will serve to protect government and private sector interests from increasingly dangerous cyber threats.

&gt;Dear Missouri MoveOn member
&gt;
&gt;Missouri State Representative Rick Brattin is proposing intelligent design/creation be required teaching and given equal time in every science classroom in Missouri
&gt;
&gt;This will also require the schools to spend money on new textbooks on or including intelligent design.  
&gt;
&gt;We need to tell the Missouri General Assembly NO on HB 1227. That's why I created a petition on SignOn.org to Rep. Rick Brattin, which says:
&gt;
&gt;We do NOT want intelligent design taught in Missouri science classrooms.
