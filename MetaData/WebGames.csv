I'm not trying to be heavy handed, so how about weekly discussion threads, every Sunday? I liked the CSS that is used in /r/freebies and others, and asked the creator if I could use it. If the majority of folks don't like it, we can work out a way to fix it up to everyone's liking, or do away with it entirely. /u/fuckcancer and /u/seronis will be unbanned as soon as we have spoken with each other amicably (I don't expect them to apologize, I only expect them to follow the rules in the
 sidebar in future, they are more than welcome back).

Sorry if this has put anyone off, and I remove every off topic/non-game link. 

sorry for any bad formatting or typos I might've missed

**tl;dr **

We will start having weekly discussion threads, or any /r/webgames related problems/likes/dislikes you may have. 

***-edit-***

A user who was banned previously has threatened to expose my ""overly heavy ban practices"" in regards to him getting banned for something 3 months ago, for all to see, with all names redacted except mine, since I am the name that will say ""to redacted"". I wanted to post this before they had a chance to cherry pick and blow something else out of proportion. If anyone needs to see a screenshot of my inbox for further proof, I will have to photoshop the names out of there, which will have to wait until around this time tomorrow morning, since I will be going to bed soon.

So, and I think that aside from the die-hard ""No reposts ever"" folks, [overwhelmingly, people want to allow them](http://www.yourfreepoll.com/kirelhirsr.html), but not everyday.

I have been trying to come up with a perfect solution, to see if it is working) is best. I looked through the entire thread, and found suggestions that I thought were extremely helpful, and these are helping me to shape ""policy"", and I just wanted to thank the folks who participated in the thread, since I sincerely wanted everyone's input on the matter, and I got quite a lot of feedback. A couple of the comments that stood out to me were:

* [Wabbiteh](http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/zl3cy/reposts/c65q9od) made a post, and post them for ad money. The original dev gets paid for ad clicks on their own site, versus some content thief somewhere.

* [Turtlecunts](http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/zl3cy/reposts/c65ky6k) also made a really good suggestion

* [Kitsy](http://www.reddit.com/r/WebGames/comments/zl3cy/reposts/c65o28o) and wabbiteh also made a good suggestion about tagging a post as a repost in the title. This is a good way to appease (I hope) the diehard ""no reposts"" people, etc.. 

Lots of other good suggestions were made

**Reposting after 6 months is perfectly fine, or the author's original site, so that people aren't gaming the system to drive traffic to their sites.**

This is obviously a work in progress

I've been thinking lately that, and was wondering if anyone wanted to drum something up? If not, that's cool, we will keep what we have, since Matt did a good job with it.

Also, so technically this is a submission I suppose, but I wanted to seriously tell all of you [spoiler](/s ""awesome"") [spoiler](/s ""WebGam"")ers how much I [spoiler](/s ""totally"") [spoiler](/s ""freak"")ing [spoiler](/s ""love"") you [spoiler](/s ""guy"")s.

&gt;* It's not strictly forbidden to submit a link to a site that you own or otherwise benefit from in some way

&gt;A lot of folks here actually work hard

&gt;A lot of other folks just happen to love games, and they do so for meaningless karma points, not ad revenue, and I think they are awesome for that.

&gt;But a lot of scammy links have been coming in lately from shitty flash dump sites that have around 7 ads per page and no original content
