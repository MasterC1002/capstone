I've noticed that some people struggle to pick out melodic lines or chords of a particular song that they're trying to play

With this in mind

--------

Introduction
-

Just as atoms are the building blocks of life, or consecutively. Every bit of music that you hear can be broken down into a series of intervals. Bach? Intervals. The Foo Fighters? Intervals. Your doorbell? Intervals. There are two main things that you should know about intervals - (1) how big or small it is, and (2) what it sounds like. By learning how to identify intervals by ear, you will be able to transcribe songs with ease! 

**What this guide will give you:**

- a basic understanding of the building blocks of music (intervals)
- a better understanding of how chords and scales are made up
- a method of developing your ear (aural skills)
- Some interesting music facts to wow your friends!

**What this guide will not give you**

- understanding of advanced interval topics
- instant mastery of intervals - you will need to put some effort into learning intervals

**Prerequisite Knowledge**

You should know a few things before starting this lesson:

- How to read tablature
- How to make sounds on a ukulele
- Know the musical alphabet (if you don't know it
- How to read english

Being able to read music notation is not a requirement

---------

Basic Interval Information
-

There are two kinds of intervals: Harmonic Intervals and Melodic Intervals. This is just a fancy way of saying ""Notes that are played at the same time"" and ""Notes that aren't"". [Here](http://i.imgur.com/N1SYKwF.jpg) is an example of a harmonic interval. [Here](http://i.imgur.com/Fxaka4T.jpg) is an example of a melodic interval. Melodic intervals can go up (ascending) or down (descending).  We'll be learning mainly about melodic intervals

&gt;quotes like this.


There are also two parts to an interval's name. The first is its *quality* and the second is its *type*. For example

**Types of Intervals**

There are 8 basic types of intervals:

- Unisons
- Seconds
- Thirds
- Fourths
- Fifths
- Sixths
- Sevenths
- Octaves

An interval's type is based on the letter name of the notes. For example, or natural) that goes up to any B (no matter sharp, flat, or natural) will be a type of second. Any  F that goes up to any C will by a type of Fifth. How am I getting the type? I count letter names. Let's look at the F-C example. If you count notes from F up to C, starting with F=1, you get 5 notes from an F to a C. Thus, it's a Fifth. Why don't you try one now? An E that goes up to an A. 

...

...

...

If you said a Fourth

This also applies to intervals that go *down*. For example, then count down to C. You should get C = 4. This makes it a type of Fourth.

&gt;Tip: when dealing with harmonic intervals


**Qualities of Intervals**

This is a little more tricky to deal with. While the type refers to the note names, you can tell the quality of interval by the number of frets (along one string) between the notes.

There are 5 main types of interval

- diminished
- minor
- Major 
- Perfect
- Augmented

&gt; Note the use of capital letters. It's important. 

That's all the information on quality that I will cover right now. I'd just like you to be aware of the names

-------

Unisons 
-

These are important intervals to be able to hear in order to tune your instrument. They're fortunately easy to hear!

**Perfect Unison (P1

This is the easiest interval to learn. The distance between two notes of a Perfect Unison are *Zero* frets apart. That's right

Here are a few examples of Perfect Unisons:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/yoY5wNi.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/Wx0IGAt.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/6AAGFnq.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic Perfect Unison! You use this interval to tune you strings to themselves. 

Because Unisons are the same note

---------

Seconds
-

Seconds are pretty cool intervals

&gt;Lingo: moving a melodic line by a second is called *stepwise motion*. Moving by a larger interval is called *motion by skip*. 

**minor Second (m2

The smallest of the seconds (we're ignoring diminished and Augmented for now), then you're doing great! Here are some examples of minor seconds:

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/SSnbm05.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/CCf3ZUU.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/SSSTve7.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic minor Second! This interval is what makes ""maj7"" chords sound so cool!


The key to hearing minor Seconds is to listen for the ""Jaws"" theme. Slowly alternate between the two notes in one of the examples above


**Major Second (M2

The largest of the seconds

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/M4rxWCO.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/clcJtCY.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/xHYLv11.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic Major Second! This is the first interval you hear in the song Chopsticks. 

Do you know the happy birthday song? well the notes on the words ""-ppy"" and ""Birth"" are a Major Second! You can also think of the first two notes of a scale. 

&gt; Bonus: can you identify the interval between the notes on ""Ha"" and ""-ppy""? ....... If you said Perfect Unison


--------

Thirds
-

Thirds are another cool interval, then a minor third, then another minor third. It's actually pretty fun to see what kinds of chords you can get by stacking the different types of thirds (if you're a music nerd like I am)

&gt;Music Theory tidbit: Harmony by the stacking of thirds is called *tertian* harmony. During the 1800s and on

**minor Third (m3)**

This interval is three half steps wide

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/v0QPQ1b.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/05g7oUq.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/mWGgJjS.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic minor Third. If you were to add 2nd fret g string to those two notes

The song I use for minor thirds is Brahms's Lullaby. If you don't know that one by name

**Major Third (M3)**

The second type of third

- [1](http://i.imgur.com/g6npdpg.jpg)
- [2](http://i.imgur.com/LpT2k4k.jpg)
- [3](http://i.imgur.com/CmsFzcP.jpg)

&gt; the last example is a harmonic Major Third. I have no interesting facts about harmonic Major Thirds. If you were to add 3rd fret A string and open g string

The song I use for Major Thirds is Kum Bah Yah. The first two notes form a Major Third. 

&gt;Bonus: What interval does the second and third notes form? If you said minor Third

**Introductions**

Please feel free to introduce yourselves in the comments.  Try not to out yourself; we don't want to know who you are IRL.  But tell us a little about you

A little about me: I teach at a University in the U.S.  I am NOT a music professor (and that will probably show), partly because of joint and tissue issues resulting from guitar, and partly because I became interested in the benefits of the high G tuning from a music theory standpoint.  Four years on, I would describe myself either as an intermediate player or as a rank beginner, depending on the day.  I am primarily a fingerstyle player, and dabble in lots of genres, but primarily American folk and Celtic music.

My uke collection is fairly modest (I have to care for and feed guitars and mandolins

All my professor-iness has conditioned me to be comfortable with writing a lot to try to make my meaning more precise

* It's way easier to learn uke well enough to not sound like shit. It took me almost an entire year to learn my way around a piano keyboard well enough so that the neighbors stopped complaining. It took me roughly 45 minutes to learn how to tune my uke and play songs in C major.
* It's much quieter than a piano. I can play ukulele whenever the hell I want
* It is tiny
* It is portable! I have to go to my piano if I want to play it. But this is a tiny box made of magic-infused wood, no. No, I don't. But I know that as empirical fact, because *you can do that if you want to, even if your apartment's bathroom is the size of a coffin or an airplane bathroom.*

All of my tabs are from tablature sites


My only problem is that they are all in .doc format in a .rar archive and there is no way to post them here in an easy to download form. So

There are three files in the archive. A READ ME that explains what you have


So, feel free to message me here and I'll be happy to email the tabs. Keep strimmin'.

**CORRECTION:**

A fellow redditor brought it to my attention that I have been using the wrong terminology when referring to these as tabs. They are actually chord sheets. Whereas

- [Intervals pt. 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/ukulele/comments/1iulsn/intervals_for_ukulele_players/)
- Chords pt. 1
- Scales pt. 1
- Chords+Scales (key)
- Intervals pt. 2 (compound intervals!) 
- Scales pt. 2 (exotic scales!)
- Chords pt. 2 (shiny chords!)
- Scales pt. 3 (modes


So expect new ones to come out whenever I have the time to write them out! If you have any suggestions/requests

Please note that the Chords guides will be significantly more difficult to understand, the rest tends to follow shortly. 

Without further ado


--------

Introduction
-

A *chord* is defined as

&gt; a group of (typically three or more) notes sounded together

Basically, as well as the common varieties of seventh chords. We will also learn how to aurally pick out these types of chords in a song, which will eventually help you figure out the chords to a song! This process combines knowledge of chords as well as scales, so you shouldn't expect to come out of this lesson able to do this at a high level (but you will be able to do it to some extent). 

Chords are more complicated of a topic than intervals, each providing the information necessary to understand the next. They are: 

- Part 1: Chord Theory
- Part 2: The Common Types of Chords
- Part 3: How to Hear Chords


**What this guide will give you**

- A basic understanding of the common types of chords.
- How to hear the different types of chords. 
- A more advanced understanding of the way chords are built.
- An understanding of the terms *inversion* and *voicing*.
- The means to figure out how to play chords without looking them up.
- How to read common types of chord symbols


**What this guide will not give you**

- Understanding of the principles of voice leading.
- Instant knowledge of every chord on the ukulele.
- Knowledge of how chord progressions are built (that's coming later!) 
- A sexy beard. (though if you take long enough reading it


**Prerequisite Knowledge**

You should know a few things before starting this lesson:

- How to read tablature
- Know the note names on the ukulele (if you don't
- Have a solid grasp on the basic 13 intervals


Being able to read music notation is not a requirement, so being able to look at your uke and see where the notes are is a plus.

---------


Part 1: Chord Theory
- 

Chords use some of the same terminology as intervals, so make sure to keep them separate in your mind. There's also a few more basic terms that we will cover later on. (actually there are a lot of chord-related terms that can be quite confusing but no-one needs to know that now…)


**Building A Chord**

Before we can do fun things like inverting chords, and then playing the note a third above the second one. For seventh chords, you simply put another third above the highest note. It's kind of like building a tower by connecting lego blocks of different colors. 

&gt; Note: If you remember from the Intervals lesson

Each note in a chord has a specific name

- Root
- Third
- Fifth
- Seventh

Let's take a look at an example chord to see how these terms apply! Start with the note C on your ukulele. Add the note a M3 above it (E). Add the note a m3 above the E (G). Finally add the note a m3 above the G (B-flat). You now have a C7 chord (we'll get to why later). 

&gt;If you're struggling finding those notes

The order of our chord is now C E G B-flat. As you see, you can start applying the terms! They go in the order listed above,from lowest note to the highest one, so that gives us this:

- Root: C
- Third: E
- Fifth: G
- Seventh: B-flat

&gt; Tip: if your chord isn't a seventh chord, Third, and Fifth (more on that later)

Let's do another chord as an example. Start with D on your C string. Find a M3 above it (F#). Next find a m3 above the F# (A). Finally add a m3 above the A (C). You now have a D7 chord (again

&gt;If you're struggling finding those notes

Take a look at the order

- Root: D
- Third: F#
- Fifth: A
- Seventh: C

Those of you who understand intervals really well might have noticed that the name of the chord member corresponds with the interval above the root it is. Notice that A is a Fifth above D

- The Root
- Which notes are in the chord

Let's try an example. The root of your chord is A. Your chord includes the notes C E G and A. Here's the process you should use to identify this chord. 

- What is my root? It's A.
- Which notes am I using? C, and A.  
- What note is a third above A? C. 
- What note is a fifth above A? E. 
- What note is a seventh above A? G. 

Therefore

- Root: A
- Third: C
- Fifth: E
- Seventh: G

Notice that they are now lined up by thirds! If you had trouble following this process

I'll provide some examples now for you to figure out. 

- Root: E, G#, E  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/aqjwChg.jpg)
- Root: F, E-flat, A  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/hMG8g9C.jpg)
- Root: C, C, E  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/ojt1M8p.jpg)
- Root: B, F#, D  - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/fHHOgeq.jpg)

Remember, as an example), then there is not that particular chord member in the chord. Here are some examples with only three note chords (but I'll double notes, as if they were played on the ukulele): 

- Root: C, C, B-flat - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/ZTx94By.jpg)
- Root: A, A, E - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/kOaQuHY.jpg)
- Root: G, D, G - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/Czh0AUV.jpg)
- Root: E, G#, D - [Answer](http://i.imgur.com/pDh9zCI.jpg)

&gt; Yes, most likely Chords pt. 2. 

**Identifying the Chord Members of a Chord That You Already Know How To Play**

Right now you have the skills to name the parts of a chord if you know the Root and which notes make up the chord. If you knew how to discern the Root given just what notes your chord is

The key to identifying the Root lies in being able to put a collection of notes into order so that they are thirds apart. At first this will take some trial and error

&gt;Likewise

Let's try one! Here are your notes: G, and C. Your first instinct might be to order them from lowest to highest: B-flat, C, E, G. While your top three pitches are good, the B-flat is only a Second away from C, instead of a Third. If you put the B-flat above the G

Here's another example, A. If you put them in the order F, A, C, and said that the Root is F, that's great! 

Think of any basic chord that you know (any one that you learned within the first few weeks of playing will do). Play it on your uke. Next, Rinse, and Repeat. 

&gt; If you were unable to arrange the notes so that they were thirds apart

**Interlude**

We only have a few more topics related to Chord Theory left to go! These final few concepts are the most tricky to learn, let's take a break. If you won a cookie during the Intervals guide, you can eat it now.  

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzY3wYPZQnU) a nice

Here's a summary of what you've learned so far:

- Chords contain three or more notes
- Chords are (most often) based on stacking thirds
- The notes that make up chords have specific names based on their relation to the root
- By ordering a selection of notes so that they are thirds away from each other, the other chord members of that chord. 
- You can leave out members of a chord and still have a chord. You don't know what to call it yet
- Likewise

Here's a list of reasons why you are a pretty cool person:

- You play the ukulele
- You want to better your musical knowledge to be the best player you can be
- You own several shirts

Here's a list of the last few things you'll learn in this section:

- The difference between the Root of a chord and the *bass note* of the chord
- Just what the heck is an inversion and why do I care?
- How can I use different chord voicings to spice up my playing?

The Rules:

1. All entries must be submitted as a reply to this thread.  

2. Voting ends February 28.  The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3. You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele.  You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano.  Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song.  I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

4. It would be impossible to actually enforce rules about voting

1348982655.0,10p8bj,Aloha guys! Ryan from Ukulele Underground here. We want to give out some copies of our brand new DVD to beginners if you're serious about learning the uke.,esaks,43,2,55,"Hey guys

It's always been our mission at UU to grow the next generation of ukulele players throughout the world. To us it's important

We put a lot of though into creating what we think is the best way to get people started with music in this day and age. What we came up with was this [DVD](http://ukeunderground.bigcartel.com/product/the-ultimate-beginner-dvd-for-ukulele). We crammed it full of useful tips and tools that every beginner should learn to get started and even created some extra downloadable DVD owner exclusive content. 

I've been lurking this subreddit for a while and see that there are many folks here who are excited and just getting into music for the first time with the uke and I think its awesome.

So here's the deal. We'll give away 10 copies of this brand new beginner DVD to 10 people who truly consider themselves a real uke beginner free of charge to help you with your musical journey. I'm talking real beginners here only please

Hopefully this DVD can help you and maybe one day you can give it to someone else to help them get started on their uke playing adventure.

I'm not quite sure how to decide who gets them

Aloha
Ryan &amp; the rest of the UU guys.

**TL;DR: If you're a true uke beginner

Edit: I'll be back on tomorrow to check the comments. I'll PM the people who we will be sending the DVDs to.  Mahalo &amp; Aloha!

Edit 2: Wow such great response! I have the 10 people I want to give this to. If I didn't choose you, people who really know next to nothing about the uke, so if you're already playing songs, this will be too simple for you. You can probably learn more from just watching the videos we have on ukuleleunderground.com.

Congrats to the peeps chosen. I'll be PM'ing directions to you. Aloha.

For the record the peeps chosen were:

1329552347.0,pv1vv,Finger Picking Tutorial ,ukulelecanadian,30,4,10,"This week I had a request from a friend about how to finger pick properly. So i figured I would post a simple Ukulele finger-picking technique along with some tips and tricks to make your picking faster and sound better too.

The beautiful thing about the Ukulele is that it only has four strings. This makes it really easy to begin playing, four strings is a good thing. Especially if your trying to learn how to pick.

  **The Simple Pattern:**
The pattern your going to learn is the 1-4-2-3 pattern, just like it would be if you were strumming.

The thing to remember with the Ukulele is that the strings are numbered from the bottom up, and so on. 
With the 1-4-2-3 pattern you will pluck the strings in the order of the pattern to complete it.
 This is the case with all picking patterns and learning this now will help you a lot if you ever want to read and play Ukulele tabs in the future. 

For most picking patterns you will only need your first three fingers and as a general rule, and your middle finger will pick the bottom string (A). I usually float my ring finger in the air and let it wiggle around how it likes while I pick, and my pinky finger tends to push down against my uke for support, but this is really just my personal preference and you may do it however it is comfortable. 


If your playing the 1-4-2-3 pattern properly while the ukulele is open (no chord is being made)  you should be playing the strings in this order A-G-E-C. This wont sound pretty without a chord to pick, and maintain the picking pattern with your fingers.


Put very simply, then pluck the top string with your thumb, pluck the second string from the bottom with your pointer, and  finish by plucking the third string from the bottom with your thumb to end it. Repeat as necessary 

 Okay, practice, practice. Simply picking slowly while you watch some TV, or setting aside twenty minutes or so for practicing a day will help your speed tremendously, and if you get frustrated, just play something else, and come back to it later.

**Are there different kinds of ukuleles?**

Yes there are!  In approximate order from smallest to largest, tenor, and baritone.  The first three typically use the same standard tuning (GCEA) and the baritone is usually tuned differently (DGBE).  There are also other types like the banjolele (banjo ukulele), the cavaquinho (arguable granddaddy of the ukulele), and the harp ukulele.

**What kind of ukulele should I get?**

Judging preferences between sizes is a personal thing.  Some like the small size and portability of a soprano

**What brand of ukulele should I get?**

This is a hotly contested topic.  Some common brands for beginners are Kala, good sounding ukes that are ideal for new ukers who don't want to make a large investment at the outset.

**Why does my uke go out of tune so often?**

If you have a new ukulele (or new strings)

If your uke won't hold a tune at all


**How do I tune my ukulele?**

There are several excellent online and offline resources that can help with tuning.

*PC Tuner*

[Audio Tuner](http://www.supernifty.com.au/wiki/index.php?title=Audio_Tuner)

*Online tuners*

http://ukulelehunt.com/2008/04/10/ukulele-tuning-notes/

http://www.seventhstring.com/tuner/tuner.html

http://www.tunerr.com/

http://www.buraks.com/tuner/

http://www.proguitartuner.com/

*Tuning Apps*

[gStrings for Android](https://market.android.com/details?id=org.cohortor.gstrings&amp;hl=en)

Or you can get a clip-on chromatic tuner at the same time you buy your uke. :)


**What are some good online resources for beginners?**

Look to your right. :)  For those not wanting to turn their heads: 

[Ukulele Underground](http://ukuleleunderground.com) - A very active uke forum with great video lessons

[Ukulele Hunt](http://ukulelehunt.com/) - A great resource for lessons, tabs, and news

[Ukulele Tabs](http://www.ukulele-tabs.com/) - Uke tabs galore!

[Ultimate Guitar](http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/) - Guitar-centric

[Chordie](http://www.chordie.com/) - Transposable chord charts


**What are some good offline resources for beginners?**

Most major cities have ukulele clubs - Google it!  Also

**What songs should I learn to play?**

Somewhere Over the Rainbow is a common first song - the chords are fairly simple and it's almost universally appealing.  The key is to find music you want to play and hunt down music for it.  Learn those chords and play and sing!  Playing music you love will drive you to practice a lot more than a simpler tune that you're not fond of.

**What is UAS and how can it be cured?**

UAS stands for Ukulele Acquisition Syndrome - the burning desire to get another uke in a different tone, let me know.

I bring that ukulele everywhere

This summer

One weekend, and a group of Arab school children who lived in the southern part of the country and were there for a field trip. The whole time we were there, my friends and I were harassed. A kid almost tripped me when I was walking down a staircase and my friend was hit in the head with multiple rocks. 

During the first night, I decided that it would calm me to go outside onto my room's balcony and tool around with my ukulele.

The balcony to my room was about 6 or 7 feet above the ground, stopped, and watched me play around for a few minutes. He then walked away as if nothing happened. A few minutes later, the kid came back with a group of 15 or so Arab children, one of whom I could identify as the kid who tried to push me down the stairs. They all sat down in a semi-circle and watched me play for a while. 

The next thing that happened almost moved me to tears. I started playing Imagine by John Lennon, they gave me a standing ovation.

It was at that moment that I realized that the power of music can break all forms of hatred and can bring people together. One of my Ukulele heroes, “if everyone played the ukulele, the world would be a better place.” That experience 100% confirmed that belief. I thought that this subreddit would be the best place for me to share this story.

1. All entries must be submitted as a reply to this thread.

2. Voting ends 7/26. The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3. You can submit recordings that were done before the start of the contest

4. You can submit up to 2 recordings

5. You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele. You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano. Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song. I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

6. Please don't downvote legitimate submissions. Different people are at different skill levels. If you think someone sucks

3.    You can submit recordings that were done before the start of the contest

4.    You can submit up to 2 recordings

5.    You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele. You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano. Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song. I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

The Rules:

1. All entries must be submitted as a reply to this thread.  

2. Voting ends Friday

3. You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele.  You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano.  Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song.  I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.

4. It would be impossible to actually enforce rules about voting

    Just too old
    We're not old
    
    There's a bear inside your stomach
    The cub's been kicking you for weeks
    And if this isn't all a dream
    Well then we'll cut him from beneath
    
    Well we're not scared of making caves
    Or finding food for him to eat
    We're terrified of one another
    And terrified of what that means 
    
    But we'll make only quick decisions
    And you'll just keep my in the waiting room
    And all the while I'll know we're fucked
    And not getting unfucked soon
    
    When we get home we're bigger strangers 
    than we've ever been before
               Am             Dm          F               G
    You sit in front of snowy television
    
    We're too old
    But we're not old
    Just too old
    But we're not old

    A                                                 Asus2
    In the middle of the night I was sleeping sitting up
    A                               Asus2
    when a doctor came to tell me
    Bm9                                                        
    He brought me out into the hall (I could have sworn it was haunted)
    Bm9
    and told me something that I didn't know that I wanted to hear:
    That there was nothing that I could do to save you
    the choir's gonna sing
    Something in my throat made my next words shake
    and something in the wires made the lightbulbs break.
    There was glass inside my feet and raining down from the ceiling
    it opened up the scars that had just finished healing.
    It tore apart the canyon running down your femur
    (I thougth that it was beautiful
    And as it opened I could hear you howling from your room
    but I hid out in the hall until the hurricane blew.
    When I reappered and tried to give you something for the pain
    you came to hating me again and just sang your refrain:
    
    You had a new dream
    You were just a little kid
    then they stuck you in machines
    They should have listened
    Daddy was an asshole,
    now he greases them up. And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating. 
    pounds!"" and this all bears repeating.
    
    Tell me when you think that we became so unhappy
    wearing silver rings with nobody clapping.
    When we moved here togehter we were so dissappointed
    sleeping out of tune with our dreams disjointed.
    It killed me to see you getting always rejected
    but I didn't mind the things you threw
    I didn't mind you blaming me for your mistakes
    I just held you in the doorframe through all of the earthquakes.
    But you packed up your clothes in that bag every night
    and I would try to grab your ankles (what a pitiful sight.)
    But after over a year
    coming back like you always do.
    Well no one's gonna fix it for us
    You say that
    So there's no open doors and there's no way to get through
    there's no other witnesses
    There's two people living in one small room
    from your two half-families tearing at you
    two ways to tell the story (no one worries)
    two silver rings on our fingers in a hurry
    two people talking inside your brain
    two people believing that I'm the one to blame
    two different voices coming out of your mouth
    too cold to care and too sick to shout.
    
    You had a new dream
    You were just a little kid
    then they stuck you in machines
    They should have listened
    Daddy was an asshole,
    now he greases them up. And no one paid attention when you just stopped eating. 
    pounds!"" and this all bears repeating.

    Suddenly every machine stopped at once
               C        G             D
    And the monitors beeped the last time
    Hundreds of thousands of hospital beds
    And all of them empty but mine
    Well
    Completely unable to move
    The bed was misshaped
    And clearly intended for you
    You checked yourself out when you put me to bed
    And tore that old band off your wrist
    But you came back to see me for a minute or less
    And left me your ring in my fist
    My hair started growing
    My femur was breaking in half
    The sensation was scissors and too much to scream
    So instead
    Suddenly every machine stopped at once
    And the monitors beeped the last time
    Hundreds of thousands of hospital beds
    And all of them empty but mine

So I've given this question a lot of thought. Why did I choose it? I've been singing since I could remember and played piano and flute since I was very young. I loved to sing and still do, I didn't have anything to play. I just sang and I admit that it felt empty. Music's always been a big part of my life but it's been years since I've been in a performance or been practicing something. 

Music was my therapy for a very long time. I've been in a slump for a number of reasons. I moved away from home to attend school and I've been homesick and miss my dogs. School was hard on me financially and my sub-par coffee shop job was only letting me scrape by. I needed something to lift my spirits.

So I bought an ukulele.

I wasn't sure what I was looking for but I walked into a music store in town and was looking around. It turned out a friend of mine worked there and he was showing me a few things. He strummed an uke and taught me a chord and I fell in love. This tiny thing I held was the most happiest and honest instrument I had ever had the pleasure of holding in my hand. I felt whole.

So I left with it in my hands and named him Gatsby.

**TL;DR** I was feeling ucky and found a newfound love in the ukulele. 

And so I ask you this question my friends in /r/ukulele ...Why did you choose the uke?",self,t5_2qltz,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ukulele/comments/y0lc5/why_i_chose_the_ukulele/

When I first started playing, this changed how I held my ukulele. While strumming with my thumb, my other fingers could hold up the uke. If I'm strumming with my finger, it takes my whole wrist and I can no longer hold up the uke with my hand. Instead, I need to support it by holding it against my body with my forearm. The problem is that this isn't as stable as using my hand, so now when I try to change chords, the ukulele shifts as I let up on one chord so it is much much harder to for my fret fingers to find the next chord. 

For example, the uke has moved too much for me to recover. On the other hand, it's much easier to go between a C major and a G7 chord because my fret hand can continue to hold the neck while my fingers move.

I hope I adequately explained my problem such that other people can relate. Am I doing something wrong while holding my uke? Is there a better way? Or is this just something that magically gets easier with practice?

TL;DR - How do I hold the ukulele stable enough while changing chords?

**Edit:** Thanks to everyone for your answers. I realized from listening to your comments that I *must* be holding the uke wrong. Otherwise, but holding it such that the center of gravity was to my side. So when my arm held it against me, the natural place for the neck to be was protruding out in front of me. I had been using my fret hand to hold the neck close to me and that's why I was having such trouble keeping it from moving.

I am assuming from all of this that the correct place to hold the uke is more with the center of the body in the center of your body. I have been trying this with a lot of success. It feels a little awkward,,False,self,t5_2qltz,1360984398.0,,True

2.    Voting ends the 28th of June. The winner will be the top comment at the time voting ends.

3.    You can use any instruments in addition to the ukulele. You don't even have to use an ukulele- I'd allow something sufficiently uke-like such as a charango or a cuatro venezolano. Just remember that your uke (or uke substitute) must feature prominently in the song. I'll leave it up to the voters to decide how big a role it has to play.
