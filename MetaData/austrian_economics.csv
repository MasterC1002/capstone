I think this article does a good job of explaining it: [Understanding Say's Law of Markets](http://fee.org/the_freeman/detail/understanding-says-law-of-markets/).

Demand is the desire + ability to pay for goods and services. Production must necessarily come first because it is through production of a good or through labor (which is compensated with wages) that a person can have demand. He can then use that demand to exchange with other goods and services.

The two lines of argument that you will encounter. (1) Demand must come first because businessmen want demand before they produce a product. (2) Not all supply creates demand.

(1) This confuses existing demand and the creation of demand. Businessmen produce because they want to capture existing demand

(2) This argument confuses the contrapositive. Saying that supply creates demand does not mean that everything created creates demand. If a businessman creates a product nobody wants

Excerpt from his bio:
&gt;His interest in economics and philosophy began in earnest during the financial crisis of 2008, John reads textbooks for fun. Yes, he knows that it’s weird.
&gt;
&gt;This interest and concern for the state of economic understanding lead John to team up with Russ to create EconStories, “Fear the Boom and Bust”,  and “Fight of the Century”, which have become global sensations, garnering mainstream international press and over 4 million combined views on YouTube. Both videos are being used in classrooms all over the world as well as winning the prestigious Templeton Award for innovative media.

**What would be your best response to these questions and statements:**

1. Is government the antithesis of liberty?

2. One of the things that enhances freedoms are roads. Infrastructure enhances freedom. A social safety net enhances freedom.

3. What should we do with the losers that are picked by the free market?

4. Do we live in a society or don't we? Are we a collective? Everybody's success is predicated on the hard work of all of us; nobody gets there on their own. Why should it be that the people who lose are hung out to dry? For a group that doesn't believe in evolution

5. In a representative democracy, and we have children to raise.. We elect you as our representatives to look after our interests within a democratic system.

6. Is government inherently evil?

7. Sometimes to protect the greater liberty you have to do things like form an army

8. As soon as you've built an army, now we're just negotiating.

9. You say: government which governs least governments best. But that were the Articles of Confederation. We tried that for 8 years

10. You give money to the IRS because you think they're gonna hire a bunch of people

11. Why is it that libertarians trust a corporation, as opposed to my representative, seems insane.

12. Why is it that *with* competition

13. Would you go back to 1890?

14. If we didn't have government, and broccoli would be ice-cream?

15. Unregulated markets have been tried. The 80’s and the 90’s were the robber baron age. These regulations didn't come out of an interest in restricting liberty. What they did is came out of an interest in helping those that had been victimized by a system that they couldn't fight back against.

16. Why do you think workers that worked in the mines unionized?

17. Without the government there are no labor unions

18. Would the free market have desegregated restaurants in the South, in that time, that blacks should not.. The free market there would not have supported integrated lunch counters.

19. Government is necessary but must be held accountable for its decisions.",self,t5_2stjd,1345604641.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/ltrg1/jon_stewarts_19_questions_to_libertarians/

* First, would mean that the price level would have more than doubled during that time period. Does that sound remotely accurate?

I think perhaps an even more illustrative example is this: [If you use ShadowStats numbers supposedly representing 1980s methodologies

Furthermore

* ShadowStats (and its owner

Also, but not by that much (it's a difference of 0.45 percentage points; see [page 30 of this](http://www.bls.gov/opub/mlr/1999/06/art4full.pdf)).

* Their objections to the new methodologies don't even theoretically make sense. They claim that the ""basket"" of goods used to calculate CPI should stay constant over time (see the Econbrowser post I cited above, measured inflation should absolutely try to adjust the weightings of goods to accommodate these differences. In an extreme case, if an item becomes obsolete, a ""fixed-basket"" approach would still try to include it somehow. This clearly is incorrect.

* Their own statistics are not what they say they are. For instance, the housing portion of CPI was based on actual house prices, but was then changed to owner equivalent rent (the rent which would be expected to be charged for a given house). The SGS Alternate Inflation index, reflecting this difference, should have a widening gap with the CPI during the housing bubble (as price-to-rent ratios expanded), and a narrowing gap with the CPI after the bubble burst. However, if you look at the SGS estimates I linked to above

What they seem to actually be doing is just adding a constant percentage to the CPI. This is obviously wrong

In short, and if you see anyone else citing them, point out their error.

While it is true that there were far more mining and resource extraction jobs for americans during this period
Go to page 30 of:

http://www.sfu.ca/~djacks/papers/workingpapers/w18874%20(typology).pdf

And:

http://chartsbin.com/view/oau

The objection mentioned above really only holds true for crude oil, primarily after 1970, and for other commodities after 2000. Remember, real GDP grew faster during the late 1800's than it did during the post war boom between 1946 and 1970.  

If you examine the second link, under ""energy prices"").

Just about every other commodity became cheaper during the 1900's in real terms than it had been during the late 1800's

Also, and probably only contributed slightly to growth overall.  People weren't driving cars during this time, after all.

By far

Let's look at real coal prices:


http://econbus.mines.edu/working-papers/wp201210.pdf

If you look at page 3

Now

From measuringworth.com:


US	

1875 to 1900	

1946 to 1970

Real GDP	4.50%	3.68%

(The 4.5% corresponds to the period 1875-1900)


US	

1876 to 1900	

1946 to 1970

Real GDP per capita	2.39%	2.09%

So here we have a comparison between two periods, and a safety net combined with high taxation, and the former involving none of those things. Both of these periods experienced similar real commodity prices, with many commodities actually being cheaper during the latter period.  

Now, and has.  The data that I've linked to explodes the myth that the 1800's benefited from unusually cheap resources, which certainly isn't the case in real terms.  

Some people put forth the argument that land was cheaper and virtually free during this period

I don't even need to post links to debunk this one, any useful land that was in close proximity to major cities was quite expensive in the past as well. There's plenty of cheap and nearly free land throughout the US that you could easily homestead right now.  

I could even discuss all of the things that the 20th century has that the 1800s did not. Plastic jumps immediately to mind. Plastic is the cheapest, even at record high oil prices. Then there's the fact that the US printed THE world reserve currency during the post war era. 1800s USA didn't have a fraction of the global military power or financial influence that it has in the modern era.

I also understand that you guys believe that humans act in their own self interest

Keynes believed the same thing. He said that during a recession, or fearing his job, he will cut back his budget. Since one man's spending is another man's income, another person will lose income as a result of this. That person will cut back on his spending, and will cause another person to lose income as a result. This is referred to as the paradox of thrift.

Knowing that the two studies are profoundly different

I have arrived at the point where I have come into contact with the Austrian school and see some striking similarities but have come up with a potential deviation that need investigating.

Here it is:
In my view, but only the human part can exert willful influence on the behavior of the system; there are no market forces outside of those provided by human minds.

One of the human participating in a potential exchange will evaluate the personal result of a change and accept the trade if the result is acceptable.

That evaluation will take one of two forms

The outcome of an exchange can be thought of either as desire that the trade be made, if he is proposing a trade he will be fearful that the trade might not be made and his evaluation will be the amount of fear he feels for the outcome where he does not get the offering of the other. He balances this against the fear he feels for the potential outcome in which he gets the offering of the other but loses the offering he is putting up, the fear he feels for his future without that which he is offering up.  He is, in effect, balancing what he might not gain against what he might lose. He is estimating how much his fear will be reduced by each alternative and will select the one that reduces his fear the most.

Here's my problem. In a synopsis of von Mises' **Human Action**

It seems to me that in a primarily fearful environment

This is due to the value of gold\silver being regulated by the markets and not the government.

I get that but what about other resources such as OIL. As a commodies trader oil seems like a better choice because it gains value due to its non-renewability and it's continuously rising demand.

Gold on the other hand doesn't rise in value and if the US went back to a gold standard tomorrow its safe to say that gold will be in excess of $1

If we tied the dollar to oil and stopped printing US dollars then the US dollar will start to gain value again as oil becomes more and more scarce.

The obvious problem would be when the oil market collapses and that day will likely come within our lifetime however that problem can be solved by using the new value of the us dollar created through the oil peg to buy gold\silver from foreign countries to create a safety net for when oil collapses.",self,t5_2stjd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/comments/q2nmi/can_a_currency_be_backed_by_something_other_then/

Recently

Many people are asking why nobody is paying attention and why this wasn't seen sooner... Why isn't the free market reacting? the problem is that it WAS checked and [suspected of being manipulated by several private publications](http://www.fticonsulting.com/global2/media/collateral/united-states/libor-manipulation.pdf) years ago! In a free market

However

The whole ""revelation"" that these banks are manipulating the market is really not important news

[This](http://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-bank-investors-dark-040018306.html) Article basically says that the fines that these banks are incurring are even larger than the cash reserves they have on hand (read: endangering the solvency of the bank)... Anyone think that the government would go through the trouble of bailing out these banks only to kill them for being naughty later?

**TL;DR:** Yes, they will be bailed out. Moreover, this pales in comparison the sanctioned manipulation going on in other areas of finance due to government.

The guaranteed income was first proposed in its modern form by Belgian Marxist Philippe van Parijs. The positives include the reduced administration costs of aid programs, stating ""Some security [referring to ""security against severe privation and the reduction of the avoidable causes of misdirected effort and consequent disappointment.""] is essential if freedom is to be preserved, because most men are willing to bear the risk which freedom inevitably involves only so long as that risk is not too great."" So did Thomas Paine.

On the other hand, fraud in the UK welfare system creates a version of this proposal, and it has created a generation of disaffected youth. The program has eaten away at the foundation of their culture, and yielded consequences such as the recent riots. 

I contend that modern welfare systems for able bodied and minded individuals is nothing short of a humanitarian tragedy. It creates an underclass, with oil rebate checks, implements this sort if system in Inuit villages. The alcoholism is finishing what Cortez started, and I do not think my hyperbole is being misused.

Furthermore, separating us from the caveman.

I want a good question to ask him. I'll try and ask the best one I get here.

Update:

Damn, and got him to sign Crash Proof and Why an Economy Grows. I stood in line to ask a question, but there was like 40 people in line and he only got to about 15 of them. Both the questions I was going to ask him were asked by other people though (Gold standard, Japan).

Some of his more interesting comments were:

1) He is confident we will return to a gold standard if/when the dollar collapses. He said it is the only standard that works. Someone asked him that isn't there not enough gold in the world to support the monetary system,000 could support the global monetary system.

2) Someone asked him about Japan. He made it seem like they were ok and that we have a much bigger problem. Reasons he cited were that Japan finances a good majority of it's debt internally and that they have a fundamentally stronger economy than the US

3) Timing: He said we have about 6 months - 2 years left before the system comes undone. He said specific timing impossible but that we don't have long. Pointed to the last time they tried to pump up a bubble to prevent a deeper recession was in 01/02 with Greenspan's 1% rates. That got us 6 years. This time they lowered to 0% to inflate our way out of this mess

Everything else was just his usual speech

1331240204.0,qntvn,"How ""Human Action"" changed my perspective on the ""Creationism versus Evolution"" debate",adelie42,34,14,33,"After reading Mises' *Human Action*

In short

* Evolution - as a model for the **causal relationship** between the observed variation in species alive, and that such changes are demonstrated to be ""punctual"", and not ""gradual"". This more or less explains the great diversity of species with small variations within them, and periodic extinctions, for which there is observable evidence. The acceptance / solidarity of this theory exists without an even remotely conflicting explanation to date. Advances in the theory over the past few decades have generally been adopted as quickly as they have been presented.

versus

* Creation(ism) - as a component of the **teleological relationship** between man and the universe for helping individuals discover their purpose of being. The story of ""Genesis"" explains in part that the origins of your being come from from the will of a great creator. Without going into the specifics (of which I would not be the best person to try and abridge), has proven itself to be communicated well in this form and valuable to people, as much as gold has proven itself to be a good money historically. In attempt to give this message a bit more credit, if one is struggling with the question of the purpose of existence and associated free will, an axiom / foundation of certain faith, as expressed through the story of Genesis, your existence is not accidental.

In my view, a private school, in which classroom under what name, or by what teacher is ENTIRELY POLITICAL, no matter how either side tries to frame it. Are there real issues to resolve in developing a quality egalitarian curriculum (the necessity of which being a completely different debate)? Sure, but not to some great controversial degree with *this* issue worth berating people over relative to any other subject.

As a ""fan"" of science and the rise in the standard of living it has brought us, that's just like your opinion, man"", when something can't be proven by the venerated ""scientific method"". I think it is arguably as narrow minded (separate from excusable) as believing the Bible is the only canon of absolute truth.

Want a real issue? Why the hell are Economics classes still explaining US Interventionist policy as ""the unquestionably *reasonable* compromise between the *extremist* proposals of Market versus Command economies""? As if that can be said with any kind of intellectual honesty. When will *that* belief be relegated to the category of ""religion / history""?

I mean if a company has soaring productivity and low costs it doesn't mean that alone it'll be successful it needs a certain amount of consumer spending to vindicate the investments without it the project will perish. Now obviously I disagree with the Fed's policies of easy fast cash to stimulate the economy but at the same time I haven't been able to dismiss the theory that spending does stimulate economic activity and is an essential tool to gage whether the investment you made was a success or not.

In my perspective, even illegals. This could boost revenues greatly and help with the deficit. However, there are provisions for rebates for poor families so I'm actually not too sure how it would affect illegal immigrants since a lot of them are poor.

Here in Bishkek, they simply shut off the hot water to the entire city for a full month.

This is my first (and hopefully last) interaction with Planned Parenthood. The city I live in has ONE clinic that does abortions, just a pill). At one point my girlfriend asked me ""How can they stay in business being so inefficient and expensive? You'd think the government would offer abortions for free because *they save so much money in the long run*!"" I immediately pointed out that their monopoly was *because* of government, they already receive subsidy, and that human beings are NOT burdens to society, by and large, otherwise we'd have no productivity to tax to pay for this stuff in the first place.

It kind of occurred to me

Sure, but how in the world can people think that intrinsically, the more abortions, the less burden/more stuff for the rest of us.

Human beings are the most precious resource of ALL. The left looks at the material resources of countries and thinks that's what makes them economically viable. In the long run, when the government gets out of the way and the labor force grows.

So which comes first? The US Bond market collapse or the inflated college market collapse?

1326815936.0,okxzh,Why we should have competing currencies.,ThePie0fSauron,19,1,8,"A lot of people don't understand the idea behind competing currencies and why certain people advocate them. I'm here to explain the best I can why you should at least consider auditing the Federal Reserve and allowing other things to compete with Federal Reserve Notes.

First of all

Secondly, but only for people who have the money to invest i.e. the 1%. How can the 99% invest their capital to hedge against inflation if they don't have the money to invest? Why in competing currencies of course! By having multiple competing currencies, people can invest in as few or as many as they want, and still use their money. Not only can they be used as a hedge against inflation, but they can also help to lessen the amount of inflation over time by having more currency to inflate.

Of course we know if the dollar crashes it hurts everyone who is invested in the dollar (most americans who have any savings, this lessens the chances of a crash effecting them as badly as it would if they only had their saving invested in one entity. Having competing currencies makes it easier for the little guy to diverse his portfolio. In fact, if one currency does crash, it could potentially make the other currencies value go up, thus recouping your losses (at least to a certain extent).

I know many of you are opposed to the idea of a free market economy, only the 1% are going to be able to lobby them. And it's not like we wont get another liberal president.

I know a lot of people are against the gold standard and don't think it can work and are against ending the Fed

Our money has value not because it is backed by shiny metal but because it is backed by the full faith and credit of the US Government. That has proven itself to be much, much more valuable than specie over time. It has allowed progress in the world through extending credit. Banks can thus amplify the power of money via the multiplier effect.  It is the basis of all modern economies, and going back to the gold standard would be a step backwards akin to trading shells or bartering homespun. **If geopolitical events would really bring down the dollar, why did the US dollar maintain its value during WWI and WWII?** Those conflicts were infinitely more traumatic to the world than the much smaller-scale skirmishes happening in the Middle East right now.

•	Bailout of a company might be seen as a necessity in order to prevent greater, or for profit 

•	Bailouts are a necessary evil

•	To many jobs will be lost if the government doesn’t step in and help banks when they are failing

•	After a bailout occurs

•	 If banks are not bailed out any company that relies on the bank for their finances have a risk of failure as well (small businesses depend on healthy and functioning banking systems.)

•	Our society is built on the idea that we help those in need in any way we can, everyone must do their part.

•	The American Bailout bill helped homeowners facing foreclosure by guaranteeing them their much needed loans and assisting them in adjusting their mortgage terms.

•	Bailouts prevented bankruptcies

•	 According to studies from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as the rate of mass layoffs. 

•	By creating the bailout

I understand as a matter of principle why it's not a good thing, and how you dealt with them.

There are some things I would like to research further

1. Restrictions on branching: why would ""keeping track of the value of currencies"" be a problem for the public? Money is a commodity like anything else, and bread. Why is money different? I'm led to believe that there is something more to this issue that I missed. In addition, my *intuition* says that branching would prevent competition between currencies, encouraging irresponsible levels of bank reserves, but I would want some evidence to confirm this.

2. The Knickbocker Trust: what really happened? Why did the copper stock drop so fast? Were the trust's activities uninfluenced by legislation?

3. Why were shipping costs apparently too high for local farmers?

Many people, education, and finances.   It's an unusual time where the usual financial and educational advice (buy a home as soon as you can afford one, always go to college, invest in the stock market, etc.) isn't a safe bet anymore.  The older are investigating how to protect what wealth they have created and, if they're laid off, if any.  While the young are investigating what education and career planning have promising demand.  With how divorced universities are from the private sector today--thanks to gov't student loans--a college student will have a very tough time predicting what degree makes sense (even many of the engineering degrees are experiencing difficulties) by merely listening to his/her professors and advisors.  So

There are very few alternatives to college for today's young.  Long gone are the blue-collar jobs that were a ladder into the middle class.  This is one of the reasons why colleges have become so saturated and a clusterfuck of disinterested students not adequately serious about--and possibly not naturally intelligent enough for--their studies.

As a 24-year old college student with almost no wealth to protect, and Chemistry, completing bachelors degrees in at least two of these and pursuing masters' in fields of chemistry.  I'm trying to absorb as much math, science, and engineering knowledge and credentials as I can in this time of uncertainty and stagnation, and, when many of the corrections hit and US goods-production is forced to resurge (Americans forced to also contribute value instead of merely consume it)

Most of us here who have the benefit of the Austrian perspective are well-aware of the long-term decline in American goods-production and long-term increase in service sector jobs, and most of us also view this as economically-unsustainable.

So, and compile the data of other like-minded financial analysts.  Specifically, I want to organize in detail data concerning American labor, consumption, and domestic natural resources.  I eventually want to extend this data to also include most of the major players on the global market in essential and emerging industries and products as any valuable conclusions drawn about the American economy will invariably integrate and obviously be linked to global trends, too.  I've already begun this, as I see it, but am probably only 5% along my trajectory and think I can greatly benefit and accelerate the process by building off any foundations that have been previously built.  Working alone

I have no pretensions of the difficulty in forecasting, and forecasted demand, one could be as agile as possible and make sound life decisions that would be cognizant of said realities, realities many of us strongly believe will come to pass witin the next 15-30 years.

So, but there's no sin in at least trying--you probably won't be *that* far off.  I would also imagine cheap political opponents would use it against you.)

Decades ago, dead trees and undergrowth created a tinderbox that caused extremely dangerous conditions and very large fires that could not be controlled. Today, we understand that forests and their occupants *need* fires to grow strong and healthy. Small, naturally-occurring fires take out many of the tall trees, allowing the sun to reach the forest floor again and giving new trees a chance to succeed and grow. Nutrients from dead and burned plants are returned to the soil to fertilize a new generation of plants. Certain trees have seeds that are only ""unlocked"" by a fire. While appearing catastrophic, a fire is a necessary and healthy part of forest life.

In the same way, and keeping the old ones around longer than they should be. Eventually, the amount of ""dead wood"" in the economy creates conditions for an extremely severe and widespread crash/fire that destroys far more than many natural downturns/fires would have. Our economy, like a forest, needs to grow, develop, and burn according to its natural cycle. Efforts to stop the crash/fire are the root cause of much more pain for many more people,,False,t3_ww0f7

The chart suggests that Reagans ""trickle down economics"" was responsible for the widening gap between the rich and the poor and that the solution is presumably to adopt some sort of socialist policy. 

It probably isn't valid to blame Reagan's policies given that the widening gap seems to start during Carter's presidency

My thoughts are that it might be related to the US leaving the gold standard but that appears to have happened 7-8 years earlier.  The timing seems to coincide with the [1979 Energy Crisis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1979_energy_crisis) which was in retaliation for the US leaving the gold standard.  Inflation and interest rates were also high around this time.

To get all that together I have put a lot of time, into creating videos, and editing those of others; which has often required getting their permission and establishing good relations.

Some of the videos that are doing well:

[**Image 1**](http://vforvoluntary.com/images/tumblr/succesful_videos2.png)

With that experience

Another thing I’ve found the opportunity to do was start an [Austrian economics subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/austrian_economics/) (a subreddit is a forum within the social news website [Reddit.com](http://blog.reddit.com/2011/09/how-reddit-works.html)

&gt;*The goal with this community is to be a place of respectful discussion
&gt;
&gt;*To this end all users are asked to refrain from personal attacks and down putting statements; and instead to be cordial.*

This policy (on which I moderate strictly)

[**Image 2**](http://vforvoluntary.com/images/tumblr/austrian_economics_stats1b.png)

*(monthly unique visitors has exceeded 10K since January)*

The respectful nature of the subreddit has aided in attracting some prominent Austrian scholars and promoters, Jeffrey Tucker, and more are coming up.

At the current rate

I also moderate [/vforvoluntary](http://www.reddit.com/r/vforvoluntary/) and [/libertariancomics](http://www.reddit.com/r/libertariancomics/)

From 2007 on, that has become more difficult. What I would really like to do is become full-time dedicated to the cause of understanding political and personal liberty and spreading those ideas; in cooperation with others. I have generated a little bit of income through advertising and links, but (monthly) donations can make it really workable. The more I receive, the more of my time I will be able to spend on it.

I have created a webpage that contains my [current plans and ideas](http://www.vforvoluntary.com/plans-and-ideas/) regarding content; which I will keep updating. As before

http://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/14hpfc/econ_101_you_dont_create_jobs_because_you_have/

Every now and then I decide to venture into /r/politics to attempt to make simple arguments in favor of free market economics. Obviously I do not expect a majority to accept my views or even read them. So this isn't about votes or support. This is about me attempting to make better arguments in favor of sound economics. 

First I will admit that debating economics with people isn't  my strongest suit

So here is what I attempted to say in regards to what creates economic growth and jobs. My explanation is that production which comes from savings and investment is the key to economic growth and job creation. Production is the horse, without demand there can be no supply."" And superficially this is true. If people stop demanding Ipads, no Ipads will be created. But  I then go on to explain that everything that an Ipad is made up of must first exist in one form or another. So in a sense, without supply there can be no demand. This is where I may be getting my words mixed up and working counter to my goals in this debate. 

So help me better formulate my argument against the fallacy of demand creating supply or more specifically consumption making way for production. 

I obviously can find most of these answers below.

http://mises.org/daily/581/

But what I am more interested in hearing feedback from other people because these types of discussions will always come up in an economic debate. We need to formulate better arguments rather than simply quoting economists.

How does one justify not using empirical evidence to interpret a phenomena?
