This is a randomizer program that takes a different route to the Reasonable gen3 randomizer recently released - instead of randomizing one set of games extremely thoroughly it aims to randomize every Pokemon game equally well

Right now it supports every main-series English ROM

 * Starter Pokemon
 * Wild Pokemon
 * Trainers Pokemon
 * Pokemon Base Stats
 * Pokemon Types
 * Pokemon Abilities
 * Pokemon Movesets
 * TM Moves
 * TM/HM Learnability
 * Static Pokemon (e.g. given by NPCs
 * The moves that Move Tutors teach


The [download is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=) and you can get the source code [here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/source/browse/#svn%2Ftrunk%2Frandomizer)

The [version which doesn't need an external config directory is here](http://code.google.com/p/universal-pokemon-randomizer/downloads/detail?name=UPRandomizer-120a-InternalConfig.zip&amp;can=2&amp;q=). Use this if the original complains about missing config files even after extraction.

Future features:

 * Much more support for non-English ROMs
 * Foreign language support for the program itself
 * More cool ASM hacks that you can apply to the games to customize your experience a little bit further.

I manage to defeat Beedrill with a few Metronomes

Metronome gave me Amnesia

This might take a while.

As it turned out, but it didn't affect the Absorb.

I soon used up my two potions
There was nothing I could do about it.
All I could do was use Charm unsucessfully as I watched Togepi being slowly murdered.
All that effort for nothing

Today, btw), I literally couldn't stop, but I felt some guilt for not doing my daily exercises. And then BAMM, and an idea was born.


I started to do exercises based on my actions in the game. This kept me interested in playing the game, who plays alot of Pokemon, and otherwise would had no interest in doing exercises. Short term, it really helps dealing with all the frustration we all get during the game (when my poor Piplup died by an epic crit at lvl10, I did push-ups until I collapsed - and while I still felt sorry, I could get rid of that feeling of ""okay fuck it just revive him/start another game/etc. and move forward.""

My current system for Fitlocke is:

**- IF YOU DEFEAT A WILD POKEMON:** 7 Push-ups

**- IF YOUR POKEMON GETS A LEVEL:** 7 Sit-ups

**- IF YOU CATCH A POKEMON:** 7 Squats

**- IF YOUR POKEMON DIES:** An exercise of choice till you collapse!

**- IF YOU DEFEAT A TRAINER:** 5 Push-ups

**- IF YOU DEFEAT GYM LEADER/TEAM LEADER/RIVAL:** 10 Push-ups


While these numbers don't seem much

NOTE: This is only an idea, sorry for my English, it's not my first language. [but feel free to be grammar nazi and correct me, I want to get better. :P]

Had been doing my Nuzlocke run of Randomized Emerald. No losses yet

Something is wrong

""Odin used REVENGE."" 

Doesn't Revenge usually go last? Slakoth survives with 1 HP.

""SLAKOTH used COUNTER.""

Well shit. So now I'm out of a Hitmontop. But was a real dick move by Slakoth and I really liked that Hitmontop so I stick it to the man and keep using it. One trip to the Pokecenter later I enter battle with the last trainer before Norman. 

This time it is my Hitmontop vs. a Zangoose. This thing looks dangerous so I use a Bulk Up. He uses Slash which takes me to 60% HP. I heal up and he uses Swords Dance which is fine, I shouldn't have kept him anyways. I send in Pidgeot for the cleanup. 

But Nuzlocke has rules and Nuzlocke doesn't like it when people break those rules. Ace Trainer uses a Hyper Potion

So uh

Today I learned that Destiny Bond wears off after a turn. It saved Spooky.

I continued to spam Hypnosis with abandon after I learned that he could survive. Once it hit, until it was down. Spooky came out alive.

It occurred to me that r/nuzlocke may appreciate this tidbit

Basically

So in my run I will consider my trainer to start the game with a belt that **can only hold one Pokemon at a time**.  After each rival battle

So
You'll soon run into him again.  He will have 2 and you will have 2.  Beat him and you will have a limit of **3**.  This does mean you won't be able to have a full team of six until **after** your 5th Gary battle (*which is the infamous Lavender Town one after the S.S. Anne*).  

This also roughly mimics the number your rival has through the game.  There will be one battle where he outnumbers you by one and one where you outnumber him by one

It doesn't prevent you from your standard catching rules (at least in my version).  You enter a new area

I haven't figured out a better name for it

2. Typelink! This is a cool idea started by /u/Artegan which is best used on randomizers. Basically

3. Deity Nuzlocke. This is another great idea

4. Monotype Nuzlocke. This is a fairly simple idea. The rules are that every pokemon on your team has to share a type.

5. Themed Nuzlocke. This is a neat idea that you can be really creative with! Some themes could be Christmas ( pokemon like Sudowoodo, and Stantler). There are a lot of pokemon that could fit in with other themes too, like Luvdisc or Ludicolo!

6. Comic or Story Nuzlocke! This is pretty self- explanatory

7. Randomizer Nuzlocke. Everyone probably knows about this anyway

8. Character Runs: These are also pretty fun. You take the team of a character ( for example

9. Destiny Run: This is best done on R/B or Firered/Leafgreen

10. One Team Challenge: In this, you can never have a full team.

I'm not sure if this helped or not

*I am new to nuzlocke

**Here is what happened**-

&gt;* used the trainer ID to determine my starter, probably the hardest possible, but oh well.

&gt;* after all the initial nonsense of starting the game, most importantly 2 antidotes, and some potions.

&gt;* Then I proceeded up the next route to quickly catch a 2nd pokemon. I got lucky and got a Weedle which I named Jazz. 

&gt;* So now I have 2 pokemon, it was a speed tie, so I couldn't ever tell which would go first, and right before i was about to land the last hit, the enemy went first and got a critical hit for the win..  

*Rock my very first catch became the first fatality*

&gt;* So now I am in a pretty sticky situation

&gt;* Weedle happened to be perfect for the journey because weedle being a poison type is immune to the main threat of the enemies

&gt;* I stumbled accross the south entrance to the dark cave, expecting something bad, and boy was I excited to see one of my childhood favorites: Geodude! I was kind of risky trying to catch it with a weedle, but i had no other choice.. after poisoning the geodude, and using a potion to keep weedle alive, i was able to catch the geodude, which I named ""Punk"" and gave an antidote. It was only level 4.  but it was the perfect type to grind against all the normal attacks which is resisted very well, the flying gym leader. once I reached the next town

&gt;* I was very skeptical about entering the bellsprout tower with Punk(geodude), let alone worrying about crits. So I decided that I needed a bit more firepower before that. I went to the beginning of the next route to catch another pokemon. I wasn't too impressed at the time, but I managed to catch an ekans(Rapps). Between ekans and weedle, the bellsprouts were no match and I gained some money from the trainers.. Also, I was really excited to have cought another pokemon within within the tower, which was a Rattatta. I could only think ""hyper fang yay"". I named Rattatta: Techno.

&gt;* So immidiately after the tower was finished I knew I needed to gather my money/potions

*Techno ended up victim of a critical hit from a wild rattatta and become fatality #2.*

&gt;* After that loss, and I knew that was my chance.. I only had 1 or 2 potions left, so it was do or die. Faulkner did fall though, with the combination of rock polish and rock throw, geodude beat the roost user.

&gt;* In the next route I had to use Rapps(Ekans) a lot in the next area due do the poison and grass types. If there was ever a normal or rock type i changed over to Punk(geodude). Things went pretty smoothly to the 2nd gym.. I ended up catching 2 Zubats, and another Ekans which was lower level. (Trance, Beat, and Appes Respectively)

&gt;* The bug gym was cake for Punk(Geodude), I get challanged by my rival, which i was completely un-prepared for. I lead with Rapps, and killed 1 of his pokemon no problem. Then he put out croconaw..  Rapps was doing ok, but was in danger of a possible critical death, and I hadnt seen croco use any water moves yet, so i figured I might be able to switch into Geodude, one more and I was in the clear.. but unfortunately, and easily the hardest to take so far. Rapps(ekans) came back out to finish off the Croconaw and Zubat that remained. Which pushed him to level 18.

*Punk the Geodude

&gt;* On my way to goldenrod, I went north to fight the trainers for money, and catch some more pokemon in the park and route 36. I got a Drowzee(Waltz) and yet another weedle(Drumstick) lol..    After buying some fresh waters, and grinding for a while, I had Rapps(ekans) at level 26, and Waltz(Drowzee) at level 20. I figured this should be fine to kill a level 17 clefairy and level 19 miltank.

&gt;* After fighting my way to the goldenrod gym leader, and Drumstick), 2 Ekans (Rapps and Appes) and Drowzee(Waltz) ready to roll. Unfortunetly in my overconfidence, I didnt feel the need to buy more fresh water with the money from the trainers in the gym, so i went into the battle with 2 fresh waters.. and I felt extremely good about Rapps(ekans) just learning stockpile...   

&gt;* So Clefairy goes down without too much trouble from metronome.. but right when miltank came out, and the proceeded to beat on her, but it wasn't doing much, and I literally didn't get a single s.def reduction off with my acid attacks..  So I would just sit there stockpiled up with defence, and pray for paralyzed, and pray for my moves to actually work...   I thought maybe i could PP stall into struggles, but that time never came at all. Eventually, which would force me to switch several times qucikly killing off the weedles, zero healing items in stock... and a massive chance to do nothing due to attract. I don't even beleive it right now, Miltank missed the rollout

*Jazz the weedle

*Waltz the Drowzee also dead*

*Appes the ekans

*Rave the weedle

*Drumstick the weedle

&gt;* After all was said and done, and Waltz being a hypno, crushing the elite four...  Just faded away like dust in the wind.

&gt;* Rapps and I decided that we had to go to the elite four



&gt;* In the next route, rocking hypnosis, STAB stomps, and intimidate. Too bad it was so short lived. In the next town I proceeded into the burned tower...  the surprise battle with my rival went a lot better than expected, as Rapps(ekans) was untouchable with Stockpile boosts. I also caught another Rattatta(Dubstep) here.

&gt;* But the saddest moment of all time had to come before I even left the tower. I wanted to beat all the trainers in the tower for the money and experience, so I stockpile just to be sure I'm not in danger. and then I figure glare to make double sure..  So after 2 embers, and a bunch of other fights, Rapps(Ekans) is down to around 40/67 hp, no real danger from this charmeleon who is dealing about, 3-4 damage per ember right? But then after glare misses, the charmeleon goes first next turn with a nice little move called Dragon Rage.

&gt;* As I watch Rapps Health plumet, please god..   Rapps Fainted.  

&gt;* My spirit was destroyed, but maybe in the greif i hadn't paid attention to the current hp..  Stantler fell as well, and the rest of the team were just lambs to the slaughter. Ending my first nuzlocke. 

*Rappes the Ekans

*Tango the stantler

*Trance the zubat

*Hip-Hop the hoothoot

* **[AnEpicPerson's FAQ](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/le82u/nuzlocke_faqcheck_here_before_asking_a_question/)**

* If the game you're playing has a VS Seeker

* If you get hit with a defense lowering move, switch out. - [Flamesblade4](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c2vsod3)

* **FOR THE LOVE OF GOD

* 1) Always assume enemy moves will crit. Always consider a move made were an enemy crit can wipe you out to be a massive risk. This way when they crit, including my starter. It was tragic. Selfdestruct resistance in important. - [Asshole_Patrol](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c2vw1b3)

* Carry antidote! I lost my squirtlel to poison running to the pokecenter. - [larpas](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c2vyt5x)

* And, ""Oh, he has a weakness, but he'll live,"" or ""I'll just use Metronome once, nothing too bad can come of it, right?"" - [AnEpicPerson](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c2wrcc1)

* 1) Grind like hell (I know this has already been stated
2) Try to get a well-balanced team. Don't just pick your favorites out of your catches
3) Unless you're doing a blind run, and Serebii are your friends. Use them to get info on the Gym Leaders, E4, and Rival battles so that you aren't surprised. - [Akitcougar](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c3jh130?context=3)

* I think it's important to note that many people end up finishing their Nuzlocke runs with a lot of cash. SPEND IT. Potions etc are extremely important. - [RadiantSun](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c3qelg4)

* A good way to counter explosions is to find a Pokemon with [Damp](http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Damp_%28ability%29) or a sturdy ghost type, or Sableye because they'll probably survive other attacks. If you are caught against an exploder without defense, you can use fly and have a chance of not being hit, but your best bet is to switch to something with high health or, if worst comes to worst, your weakest link.  
EDIT Also, avoid Thrash, Petal Dance, Outrage, etc. - [copernicusthursday](http://www.reddit.com/r/nuzlocke/comments/lukcg/official_list_of_nuzlocke_tips/c4d1wox)

* Watch out for hyper fang, remember that you can go back and catch something in a lot of the towns. It'll probably be a Magikarp most of the time, but that's good too. Traded Pokemon get 1.5x exp, try to look for trades in game as it helps a lot with grinding. In FireRed and LeafGreen, you can always get a Diglett or Dugtrio in Diglett cave. Dugtrio is a great Pokemon to have since he has great speed, attack, and learns a lot of great moves Remember that pokemon like Kadabra

I recently started my first Nuzlocke ever. I'm on a DS copy of HG, 2: Only catch the first you find in each area; no duplicates, 3: No legendaries/masterball, and of course nicknames. Through my playthrough, the main thing I was noticing is that I experienced very few deaths compared to the accounts and comics I had read. Through the first seven gyms, my only loss was my Golem, Gooch (3 - 27).

Then

I had gotten a bit cocky, Togekiss, Starmie, Meganium and Jolteon. The latter was a real winner; I'd lucked out getting a modest Eevee, and this Jolteon, Firo, was a powerhouse, essentially. However, I was positive that with over 100 Spa, lest I missed. Once it hit

Before I could even recover from the shock of losing him, who had my next best defenses with some strong special attacks as well. Suddenly, critical hit Hydro Pump... OHKO.

I believe I've decided on Pokemon Platinum for my next run. LG is a remake of the games that I originally started on as a child

Now, but I believe it's only available for Emerald right now? Anyway, I think an Egglocke (Eggscramble+Nuzlocke) is the way to go because 1) it's something different, and 2) it gets the community involved.

Would any of you guys be interested in seeing/helping me do an Egglocke

&gt;1) If a pokemon dies

&gt;2) Must catch the first pokemon in every new area.

&gt;3) If the catch fails

&gt;4) If it succeeds

&gt;5) In the interest of time
in my box to aid in hatching eggs more quickly

&gt;6) In the interest of time

&gt;7) All eggs must be legitimate and bred in legitimate games. No unbreedable pokemon, etc. 

&gt;8) Nicknames :D

Of course, a Pawniard! Interesting choice!"" or ""Oh, another Rattata! *I will kill your family.*"")

So what do you guys think? Egglocke or continue with traditional Nuzlocke? If Egglocke

**The most commonly asked questions of all time:**

**I changed the rules a little

Of course. This is your Nuzlocke

**What game should I Nuzlocke?**

If you're just beginning

**General**

**What is the most challenging game to Nuzlocke?**

BlazeBlack, if you don't want a hack, choose the game you are the least familiar with. You won't know what Pokemon are in each area, etc. To help with this, you could set rules so you can't use Bulbapedia, Smogon, or any other walkthrough or informative site to help you. Additionally, etc.

**Why is a Nuzlocke called a Nuzlocke?**

In the very first Nuzlocke run, because of the ""Nuz"" in ""Nuzleaf"" and the ""Locke"" in ""Locke.""

**Catching Rules**

**What are the standard catching rules of a Nuzlocke?**

Usually

**At the beginning of a game

Most of the time, it does count, and you may only catch the first Pokemon you see with access to Pokeballs.

**On some Routes

Most of the time, say, a city, then you may, as the city would count as a different area.

**Does each floor of a cave count as a different area?**

Usually, if you haven't banned Repels (as some people do).

**Are forests and caves considered a part of the route they are on?**

Ususally

**In the Safari Zone

In most Nuzlockes

**Do gift Pokemon count as a catch for that area?**

Normally, I have seen a few people say yes.

**I don't have any Pokemon that can learn an HM needed to move on! Am I allowed to catch another Pokemon for this purpose?**

Yes

**What is the ""Dupes Clause?""**

The ""Dupes Clause"" is optional and says you can opt to or opt to not catch a Pokemon you have caught and try again, etc. Some people are able to try three times. If the first, second, and third Pokemon encountered are all duplicates of a previously caught Pokemon, the third Pokemon is the final Pokemon- you can either take it or leave it.

**What is the ""Shiny Clause?""**

The ""Shiny Clause"" says you are allowed to catch any shinies on a Route

**Am I allowed to have more than six Pokemon? Can I use the box?**

Of course! Unless you want to try Vitehite's ""Empty Box Mode.""

**Fainting Rules**

**What are the basic fainting rules in a Nuzlocke?**

If a Pokemon faints

**Am I allowed to use Revives?**

Using a revive would be like bringing a Pokemon back to life, you can use them, but that wouldn't be considered a Nuzlocke.

**Do I have to release a Pokemon if it faints?**

No. You can also Permabox

**My whole team wiped out! What now?**

If you want

**Nicknaming Rules**

**What are the standard nicknaming rules of a Nuzlocke?**

You must nickname all your Pokemon

**Do I have to follow this rule?**

No. This rule is very optional.

**I forgot to nickname a Pokemon!**

Go to the Name Rater as soon as he is available and change your Pokemon's name to that. If he is not available until later in the game

**Other**

**What is BlazeBlack/VoltWhite/SeaGreen/ScorchedEarth/Etc?**

These are hacks, etc. of Pokemon the creator of the hack believes should be in the official games. These games are unofficial and can sometimes be messed up, freeze, etc.

**Okay

I'm not good with hacks, a clean ROM of the game, and something else, like UnRARx or something? If you need help with a hack you would like to Nuzlocke, please **do not consult this FAQ** as you will probably end up exploding your computer.

**I caught a Haunter/Boldore/Graveler/Kadabra/etc

Normally

**In Gen 5

I have never seen anyone *not* do this- Audinos are great to train on in Nuzlockes.

**How can I tell you about my Nuzlocke?**

There are plenty of ways to do this.

* A screenshot run- Take pictures on your ROM when someone dies, what ever. Good examples of these are [Tailes](http://s7.zetaboards.com/Nuzlocke_Forum/topic/8554659/1/) and [Haberdasher,](http://s7.zetaboards.com/Nuzlocke_Forum/topic/8538130/1/) to name a few of my favorites.

* A comic- show us your artistic skill! An amazing example of this is [Petty

* A written story- I don't have any good examples, you can always try this.

* Just tell us! Not plot or screenshots

**Where should I grind in &lt;game&gt;?**

There have been many posts about this

Just post below on some things you've used that's helpful, moves or whatever!


Tip Edits!

From ***Chipperz***: Grind. Grind grind grind.



From ***Derpynerd***: When you can

Remember the damage variation for an attack. The next one could be as much as 2.33 times stronger than the last hit

Substitute blocks status in all but R/B/Y.

Crits were based off of speed in Gen I. If something's fast

From ***Pitchy***: always make sure you're stocked up on potions and antidotes. ALWAYS

from ***Didgeripoo***:  Moves like swords dance, work up, calm mind, acid armor are your friend. If you can get a mon in and set up around 3 of these, you have a good chance to sweep the battle.

Always have a back up. Think you can take Morty with your Crobat that knows bite, but have safety net that can let you get a heal in, or finish off that tricky opponent. Relying on one mon for a major battle can be the end of you.

from ***surferdudeX***: Always think: If they have any type of priority move

from ***Ehan2***: Don't underestimate the following TM moves:

Toxic = can be used to beat an opponent you wouldn't have a chance against otherwise

Light Screen/Reflect = absolute LIFESAVERS in a Nuzlocke

Rain Dance/Sunny Day/Sandstorm = Great for powering up water/fire moves and improving the defenses of your rock/ground/steel types respectively

and most importantly...

Attract! Absolutely saved me at the Elite Four when I had only 3 pokemon left. Put it on a female pokemon

from ***More_Oboe***: Make sure you know your foe's movesets instead of just paying attention to basic typing. For example

Also, and the last thing you want is to be stalled out because you can't land a hit.

Don't underestimate the opponent. Ever. Don't do it.

This was already kind of mentioned

(Pssst. Also, two of which are breeders, and they're all very close. It's made grinding ridiculously fast, even without the speed up button)

from ***maxpower2001***: I don't always abide by this rule

from ***JulianGiraffe***: Abilities are underestimated. I would highly recommend studying up on Gym Leader and Elite 4 teams. Especially on difficult hacks.

from ***WillFerguson***: Trainer battles are your best friend for learning your mon's ability in certain situations.

from ***ManOfEpic***: Never give up. It seems simple enough

from ***Bunghole95***: goes without saying but be careful with your pokemons moves. i usually like to have a move that is super effective against itself i.e my charizard that knows rock slide can sweep any fire types if needed. can help in grinding when the wild pokemon are the same type as the one you are grinding

It also goes without saying to use a variety of pokemon even if you don't like them. remember that a nuzlocke makes you use pokemon that you would never use. i never liked the zubat line but i used one and now crobat is in my top 20 pokemon

also always assume that moves that hit multiple times such as double slap will hit the maximum number of times

from ***WilliamSchnell***: Never

On the flip side, is more reliable than Hydro Pump.

Finally

from ***DrawingDead0***: On pre-gym grinding: Usually, and the Pokemon's sweeper should be a fun fight, but shouldn't destroy you. It'll be right in that sweet spot. This is especially helpful in blind nuzlockes.

ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYS assume the next hit will be critical. You don't want to be caught by surprise.

Don't ever underestimate a potential catch. Rattata can be a monster with STAB Hyper Fang, we are beggars, and we can't be choosers.

Experience should only be a concern when grinding. When that gyarados is coming out

from ***HawkwardPlatypus***: Watch out for pokemon with the move pursuit (such as raticate) when switch grinding as this can be fatal to frail ghost and psychic types. Also pokemon with selfdestruct (such as koffing and geodude) can take down much higher level pokemon without much effort so when grinding against these try to use fast moves that can take them out in 1 hit.

from ***N7DKPIG***: Surprised this hasn't been mentioned: Don't give up or get discouraged if your starter or a favorite poke of yours is lost. It's never easy to watch your best friend go down before your eyes, get revenge, and fight on.

Also, slip up, one of them will die, and you will cry. Trust me...

from ***KainTehDragon***: In HG/SS take the time to grind up at the Pokeathlon. They sell good items (evo stones) and there is no risk to your Pok√©mon! Before the you beat the Elite Four

Also

from ***HoshieGirl21***: I don't know if this'll help but here are some things I follow.

Don't underestimate any Pokemon. While you play a regular Nuzlocke

Also try and create as many move combos as possible such as Focus Energy and then using a move with a high critical hit ratio or Defense Curl and then Rollout.

from ***Reese_Ridley***: Remember that critical hits override stat changes. I once had three Iron Defenses up on my metagross in Black 2 and Ghetsis's Hydreigon killed me with a critical crunch ;_;

from ***Silverbits***: Using vending machines for cheaper healing items is underrated. 200p for a Fresh Water that heals 50hp

If you ever get paired up with a partner that heals your team after each battle

Be wary of common typed moves that are on Pokemon you wouldn't expect. Things like a lot of Pokemon knowing Bite (Dark type) can be costly when training up Psychic and Ghost type Pokemon.

Pay attention! Don't let your mind wander while training

Have fun! We do this for entertainment

from ***Ederek_Cole***: Give yourself benchmarks when grinding for each Gym, even though I only used one Pokemon in the Gym itself.

This does three important things for you. 1) It keeps you from getting discouraged by grinding. You have a clear goal to hit, then I would've lost my strongest Pokemon. Which brings us to 3) It keeps you from having a single ""strongest Pokemon"", which ties into what was said earlier about not relying on any one or two teammates.

Its combination of poison powder followed by magical leaf left me with very few windows of attack without having to switch out into my Bellsprout which I used to sleep it then proceed to heal and switch back into Croconaw. With his aggravating use of Synthesis all the time I never really made much progress. After a while my Bellsprout was starting to drop in health. The fact that it was also poisoned did not help. 

With nothing that could fight it effectively except a poisoned Croconaw with red health I desperately looked at my party. I noticed my under leveled and neglected Butterfree of level 12. It had Sleep spore I recalled. Uncertain of it being able to tank magical leaf I open up its Bulbapedia page to check its resistances against grass. A large grin spread across my face when I noticed its double resistance to grass. Its low level still worried me

Marco the Butterfree now has an Honorary Position in my party

https://dl.dropbox.com/sh/opb8xcv4zrc8tgj/W2kamyY9el/Randomizers/B%3AW%20Randomizer.zip?dl=1

It is a randomizer ""patch"" that you run on a rom and it can randomize near everything, and on some roms even trainers.  It works like a charm, with the one small exception being in B/W, the original starters show up, but when you actually confirm, it gives you your random starter.

Example:
I chose a picture of Tepig

So all you have to do is use save states to check each starter and you're good to go.  It randomizes everything including fishing and surfing

1356141484.0,159dgs,Pokemon 3rd Gen Reasonable Randomizer (x-post from r/PokemonROMhacks),LAT10S,24,1,23,"Hello r/Nuzlocke

The [Reasonable Randomizer](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer/downloads/list) is a Java program that can modify the starter pokemon, LeafGreen, Emerald, Ruby and Sapphire, and with English, Japanese and French ROMs. The Reasonable Randomizer is different from other randomization programs in that it offers options for limited randomization, which means it won't simply pick any random pokemon from Bulbasaur to Deoxys, pokemon strength

I've hosted the program on [Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/pokemon-reasonable-randomizer). I've also included the Java source code with the program

#Randomizer Features:

+  **Unevolved starters** - You have the option to make randomized starters unevolved. 

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on strength** - this makes it so that every wild pokemon that is replaced has roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. This means that it will be very unlikely to find pokemon like Groudon in Route 101 and pokemon like Weedle in Cerulean Cave.

+  **Limit wild pokemon randomization based on habitat** - this causes the randomizer to replace wild pokemon with pokemon that have the same habitat. Selecting this option means that you won't find, or wild Horsea in the middle of a cave. 

+  **Limit Trainer pokemon randomization based on strength** - this causes every trainer pokemon that is replaced to have roughly the same strength as the pokemon that is replacing it. It means that Youngster Joey won't end up with, while Lance doesn't get pokemon like Rattata.

+  **Trainers retain type specialties** - choosing this option will cause type specialist trainers to only recieve pokemon that match their type specialty. For instance

+  **Rival retains pokemon** - the rival's last pokemon will be kept constant throughout the game

+  **Rematch trainers retain their pokemon** - trainers that can rematch will keep the pokemon they originally used. The program keeps track of the evolutions as well

+  **Trainer pokemon get randomized movesets** - the reasonable randomizer program doesn't pick completely random moves; it cobbles together random movesets from the pokemon's naturally learned moves, and tutor moves. You also have the option to use advanced movesets, which are predefined movesets that are strategically coherent. I basically used Battle Factory movesets for the advanced movesets, as well as Smogon for legendary pokemon.

Wiona drew a line across her throat with her finger, I noted that a malevolent purple aura surrounded Daniel now. He took down the Swablu in one hit, then immediately became more pale. He then took down her Pelipper in one as well. With her Altaria, however, he would not be so lucky. An almost full-powered Rollout left it with a slimmer of health. After that, the malevolent aura choking him now, he stumbled around for a few seconds before finally falling down and dying a bloodless death. I cried as I sent out my Swampert to punish the pesky Altaria with an Ice Beam.

Still reeling from the unfortunately quick death of Neil (Stunky), Zibanejad (Vespiquen), Latendress (Bibarel the HM Slave), and the egg from Hearthome City.

I get into route 210, and move on to route 215.  I catch Bishop the Ponyta, and heal up.  *I'm in it for the long haul.*

I wipe almost everything out on the route with Zibanejad, and am down to 3 Moomoo Milks and 1 Hyper Potion I found.  Last set of trainers are in sight, so I heal up and dive right in after using a pair of milks.  Double Battle.

Zbad and Alfie are first up, through the power of a critical hit, wipes the floor with Dennis' inferior Monferno.  Round 2.  Fight.

One sends out a Gyarados, and it *misses.*  Uh oh.  Confusion lands on Monferno, bringing it from 100% to a sliver of health (5 hp).  Gyarados uses Bite on ZBad, and Vespiquen takes it like a boss.  I got lucky.  Very lucky.

I get Alfredsson the hell out of there, because I love that thing, but I can't afford to let Monferno die.  I send it out and Power Gem Kadabra.  Somewhere around 30% of Kadabra's HP is drained, and it uses Confusion in retaliation.  Couldn't be any more than 20% damage.  Unfortunately, Gyarados used Thrash, and brought Buizel from 100% to the red (3 hp).  I'm shitting my pants.  I can't take this kind of abuse any more, if they decide to attack the same Pokemon

Moomoo Milk heals Silfvrberg on Zbad's turn, but with my last potion; Kadabra is dead, and Gyarados is confused.

Buizel is full HP, but get no such luck.  It hits Buizel with a Bite and brings it below half.  We're pounding away on this stupid Gyarados, and it Thrashes on Vespiquen.  6 hp.  My heart stopped.  I thought it was over.

On that turn

* The Game we'll be using is Soul Silver

* I'll be using an RNG to choose my random type

* To qualify as a usable pokemon it's final evolution *must* contain ___ as its primary type.

* I'll use another RNG to select my starter from a list of applicable pokemon.

* Each route I will attempt to catch the first pokemon I see. If successful I will then trade that pokemon for an egg in my box. If I fail

* No legendaries

* I may only carry 10 of any item at any given time

After that I caught Juular the Gastly and Joseph the Geodude. Those three made the first two gyms basically walk-throughs. 

Everything seemed to go well, poison, and took a Magnitude 8 from a Trainer's Diglett straight on. During furious grinding for the tough third gym I lost a Wooper named Willie.

After leveling up my team around 20 I felt ready. I had a battle plan for the Miltank all thought out. I was going to use Reflect with Devin

 I lost three pokemon to the ravaging Miltank, had 3 hp left. And Whitney thinks I'm mean...

EDIT: Trying to make this work. Withdrew two pokemon from the pc, I'll have to forfeit and start over :P

EDIT2: Had my new team set up, Erin the Rattata, Hedwig the Hoothoot, Heather the Pidgey and Marion the Pinsir and who do I stroll into in Burned Tower? That's right Geralt Motherf**king Rival. Totally not ready for this I fear the worst. He starts with a Haunter, Erin changes to Oskar who's going to ram that Haunter to the ground with some seismic action. 

Lick

At this moment I was feeling faintheaded. Not knowing what was up against was terrifying. So was the next move.

Curse. 

I hoped I could kill his pants with the next magnitude and change. Sure enough, lvl 6-19. The worst was thinking how greatly Oskar would have done against the Magnemite and Zubat...  ",,False,self,t5_2setk,1339110269.0,,

My team was Pagliacci, my late replacement Raichu (taking the place of my recently deceased and much loved Staraptor); Echarpe, a Floatzel; Marcellus, an Espeon; and Carni-Kiss, a Gengar. 
As a side note, etc.). When I saw the wild Ghastly as my catch for the route, I was excited, knowing I was moving and one of my friends at my new house played. I could have my Gengar.
The Elite Four went down fairly easily except for Aaron (Echarpe used Surf and bashed through Bertha and Flint
I had heard rumblings of Cynthia from my friend for a while now, but was left with low health. She followed with Lucario, so I sent Balaclava out. After a Fly (a poor move, not knowing that Lucario knew Stone Edge), I pulled Balaclava back and sent Pagliacci out to finish the job. 
Next came Togekiss, or the risky Thunder. In the end, I decided on Thunder and was lucky enough to get a critical hit, one shotting it (I later learned that her Milotic has Mirror Coat, which would have been awful if it had gone off).
Roserade. Seriously
So it had come to this. She sent out Garchomp, and my others wouldn't have lasted long against Cynthia's signature Pokemon. I had to make the difficult decision.
I sent out Carni-Kiss, and I said goodbye to my first, and last, Gengar as I got hit by a Flamethrower, finishing us both off and securing the victory for her brethren.

Scruffy was USELESS.

We go past Briney's shack and start fighting a green-dressed girl. All she had was a level 7 Zigzagoon, while all the enemy did was growl and tail whip.

Rules: Nothing too extreme. I'll be able to use items and visit pokemon centers. If a pokemon faints

The interesting twist though, I go online and look up which pokemon appear in that area, and poll Reddit. Which ever pokemon from that area gets the most votes is the pokemon that I have to catch.

I can play any of the pre-ds pokemon games

So....whaddaya think?

Story - Heartgold Nuz. At Bugsy I have a no-turning-back rule where once I start the gym, or two-on-two or whatever with Gym Leaders. My team, Tala the Sentret, Flex the OP Geodude and Seth the Slowpoke, new to the team and underleveled.

Seth is out first. My strategy: set up on the Metapod and Kakuna with curse

I did not see U-Turn coming.

Scyther out first, we'll play it that way - Go Flex. U-Turn does substantial damage, but I'm alive. No worries. I potion up. Now I'm down to a measly Super Potion, but I figure it all works the same. I spam Defense Curl like my life depends on it while the Metapod tackles me, barely scratching me. I max out defense and rock throw, and down goes Metapod.

In comes Scyther, higher defense, outrageous stat buffs and a double type advantage - I'M COOL, RIGHT?! Wrong. U-turn again, CRITICAL. AT THIS TIME OF ALL TIMES. Double damage. Ignored stat modifiers. Dead. My beloved Geodude, dead.

Now I'm panicking. Tala and Seth have a long

Thankfully, a Bellsprout, a Rattata and the Togepi at my disposal. No available catches though. I'm going to train the Rattata, Zubat and Togtic. No way am I going to risk my Bayleef to this bastard.

I have to now take a long walk to clear my head. I am actually *sad* about losing these bros. Hasn't happened to me in a long while, and without her, we wouldn't have beaten Falkner. Flex is a boss that has never been in the red until Bugsy's accursed Scyther. And Seth was new, but I love Slowbro, and I was so excited to have one. I'll miss them dearly and fight on. I can't wait for the fuckers to see the power of Supersonic, double resistance to Bug and STAB Hyper Fang.

I regret his death immensely: he was hit by a critical shock wave by Wattson's Manectric, who was in the red health. Scar had near-full hp, and I prepared a quick attack for a clean win. His paralysis held him back, and then Manectric struck with fury and death.

Maybe it was my lack of sleep. Maybe it was the fact that I was on a bus for 9 hours with nothing to do. Maybe I just wanted him to die. I don't know exactly why I did this, Richard.

I had already swept through the first four opponents, and my Mushii (Musharna) for everyone else.

Before I talk about Alder, as a backup. I would only use it when I reeeealllyyyy needed it. I already let several others die, deeming them unimportant enough for the max revive. It was my one and only second chance.

I walk in, I used Zyzyx (Chandelure) for fire, and got Accelgor and Escavalier out of the way real quick. 

Druddigon got a critical hit and took out Zyzyx in one hit with Night Slash. I was devastated. I called out Thing (Throh) and smashed him thoroughly. 

Bouffalant got a tiny hit on Thing while I used my max revive on Zyzyx, and that's when I was informed that Volcarona was my obstacle between Victory and I. I was forced to call out Richard for the first time. 

Volcarona used a Quiver Dance, and Richard was no more. I used Thing's Superpower and took whatever was left of Volcarona's HP. 

I was the champion

For my part, no real way to get an advantage (beyond abusing Audinos). Fighting through the trainers, I found two good fighters still:

**Bongo** the Darmanitan with Sheer Force was just able to crush things with his excellent speed and Hammer Arm. He also had some Bright Powder, with her natural Super Luck carried the Scope Lens, mostly because I found it appropriate. It never was a good idea, and I am fully aware of that. (there is no theme in my names; these two just happen to be similar)

His first two got taken out no problem. Then Haxorus was out and I freaked. I wanted this thing down as soon as I could- it had to be **Bongo** to take it out. Haxorus tanked like it was nothing, and it wasn't in my favor considering I was also destroying my own speed with Hammer Arm.

**Bongo** would not make it. Destroyed in an instant with a dragon tail

""Leader Drayden used a hyper potion!""

Maybe there is some way. I have an X Defend, I don't even know.

Haxorus comes in with the slash, then... 27 hp?? WHAT. **Song**'s last gift will be this fly, I'm sorry I couldn't do better, but we'll need it. It won't kill Haxorus, but it's like **Song** is saying, ""I don't blame you."" Except that...

It's a critical hit. Haxorus fainted.

As the good older sibling, from the Spyro the Dragon games I loved as a kid), Cacnea (Shactus) and Anorith (Wolverine) joined our party of two to make a family of five.

Shactus wasn't around for long, we persevered on. She had participated in well over 90% of the battles that had gone on thus far.

We arrived at Mt. Pyre and soon engaged in a double battle with a pair of Psychics. We found ourselves up against a Wobbuffet and he Destiny Bonded Zora. Unfortunately--- I had nubbishly mistaken the use of Destiny Bond for Perish Song in this battle--- and I took down Wobb with a Surf the following turn-- and he took Zora with him.

We laid her to rest there in Mt. Pyre at Level 47. Our resolve grew stronger after that-- Spike matured into Aggron soon after and Wolverine became Armaldo. Sparx wouldn't be alive much longer either-- as a level 44 Vibrava he succumbed to a C/H Selfdestruct by an Electrode in the Aqua Hideout. I buried him alongside Zora.

My strategy was simple - only have three dedicated pokemon for battling, which worked out really well. Both of them had good defences and Buzz covered Physical attacking while Vaporeon covered Special attacking.

My backup support (HM slaves) consisted of Chopper the Staravia

All six joined me as we Sparked, Ice Beamed and Shadow Balled our way through. Only Buzz and Aqua were able to battle, so I had to be careful. The Elite Four always used to consist of me + a stock of Revives (and the precious Max Revives i saved for the final battles). This time, I had zero. When we got to Cynthia, my battle bros were both on level 70. I knew we were good enough. But a little slip up could destroy everything.

It went great! Unfortunately, who gave me peace of mind earlier in the game against those dreaded SelfDestruct Geodudes.

What of the casualties? Despite hating the idea of a Death Box, like Grill the Ponyta and Cyber the Porygon. RIP guys.

I think my number one expense in this run was Super Repels. There are so many trainer battles in BW2 that if you fight all of them as well as some Audinos here and there

I went through a bit of a crisis prior to the Elite 4 when I realized that I didn't have a way of handling Shauntal's ghost types. I didn't have anything in my previous catches that would be effective against Shauntal and have good synergy with the rest of my team. 

So I looked up the Pokemon available in Victory Road and found that you can catch a Zweilous in one specific room

I trained every member of my team up to at least level 60 and evolved Zweilous. Thanks to that Hydreigon

This is the team that made it all the way. The level they ended up at is listed first

* Mencken the Hydreigon - 65 (50)
* Blitzer the Walrein - 63 (40)
* Ochs the Gliscor - 62 (37)
* Turner the Volcarona - 61 (35)
* Bly the Gothitelle - 60 (24)
* Sinclair the Cofagrigus - 60 (19)

The path to the Elite 4 was not without its losses. These are the Pokemon who died along the way:

* Day the Sunkern - 7 (2)
* Pulitzer the Magnemite - 22 (13)
* Zorua the Zorua -27 (25)
* Murrow the Stoutland - 33 (4)
* Cronkite the Pignite - 35 (5)
* Marconi the Sandslash - 49 (20)
* Buckley the Crobat - 52 (32)

Other Pokemon who were with the team for a long time and didn't die

* Greeley the Rattata - 18 (15)
* Hearst the Trubbish - 27 (14)
* Capote the Azumarill - 41 (26)
* Talese the Zangoose - 57 (32)

I suppose the next step for this Nuzlocke run is to complete the biggest post-game challenges as well: including Alder

1365650827.0,1c42dr,First Nuzlocke in my Life Finished in a Harrowing Final Battle!,Zooey-Glass,17,0,3,"Nuzlocke League Champions on Emerald!

Im STOKED!

Team: 
59 female Courtney the Camerupt
57 female Fi the Minun
50 female Edge the Skarmory
53 male Forsaken the Banette
52 male Broski the Hariyama
56 male Powderpuff the Walrein 

Elite Four Breakdown
MVP: definitely goes to Powderpuff, crits, and statuses, powered thru situation pokemon like Kingdra (OMG KINGDRA. It was a bodyslam fest. Kingdra's bodyslams paralyzed 14 of 15 times. No joke. He used all of them before i could load an X attack or two and body slam him back to oblivion. Thank Arceus for Leppa Berries is all I gotta say!) Powderpuff used a similar tactic on Milotic.

Acts of Heroism: Courtney was head to head with a Tentacruel. One surf would have 4x damage KO'd her. Fi, and this gave Courtney initiative to crack an earthquake (paired with soft sand) to destroy tentacruel. Never underestimate thunderwave!

Forsaken also recieved a tactical set-up from Fi on Ludicolo

Honorable Mentions: Broski would have played a larger role if he had not been taken out early by a perfectly aimed Sheer Cold. No one saw it coming : /

Pivotal Moments: 

Fi's Death: Pre-battle, I admit, as a sponge so I could pop a heal before getting either Forsaken or Powderpuff back in the mix. I took a gamble with earthquake and it payed off. Team Morale surged.

The Ludicolo Onslaught:
Forsaken was barely surviving surf hits. Ludicolo was paralyzed, Forsaken was able to pop curse and then a hyper potion before falling back into the surf onslaught. This was a really risky tactic, however, because if Ludicolo got even 1 critical, Forsaken would've been lost. I commend his bravery.

The Nuzlocke Run is an exercise in strategy, determination, and faith. It was a rewarding expenditure of my time that I do not regret at all.
