For the disillusioned rookies to jilted veterans

Last year (my second), and a few of their friends. My love runs deep for my friends and this is an incredible reunion. For the first day: cool weather, heavy day drinking, and a stellar Break-Bot set made for an unbelievable combination. This continued throughout the night and into the morning at camp. You see I had recently broken up a five year relationship and was being shit-on by a bad rebound. This was more than a vacation. This was pure escapism.

We revved up for another day. The shows were incredible, I scanned the crowd for an easy target. Then I locked eyes with a super cute girl with this curly top-knot and leopard pants. Jackpot. Simultaneously we said: ""Do you have a smoke?"". Shit. I was hammered and she was way cute so I said something cheezy and we decided to look for smokes together. Conversation was a breeze and her friends were cool. I ditched my buddies. Bros before.... yeah right.

We hung-out for the rest of the Radiohead set and with me not wanting to stop there she says ""We're driving back to LA."" Shit. I quickly countered with my phone number

No call all day Sunday. Better luck next time... We went hard that day. Non-stop dancing, tight pants and a heavy yet very hot miss frizzle-vibe. We caught up on the days activities and got to dancing. 

I was really digging this girl. Thoughts get going tough. She's in LA

Theft was busted. So I tried to ply her with candy. ""Five jelly beans for a kiss?"". a cheek is only so interesting. She keeps smiling and touching my hands and back. Maybe I'm ok? Just be cool. Tupac comes and goes and she says she has to leave again. Shit. ""Can I walk you to your car?"" ""That would be great."" So me, and head for the lot. I keep trying to kiss her. Mixed success. We really did have a lot of fun all three of us and regardless of the romantic interest I say we should stay in touch. We get to her car. I say my goodbye and get a real kiss. Long and soft and sweet. My motivations have shifted. I don't think I could just hook up and ditch her. I let her go. I text her as she heads back home. We reiterate the need to stay in touch. I'm head over heels, but cautious since I'm pretty faded. I come back to a grumpy camp, apparently a cell phone was lost and nobody cares about ""that stupid bitch you ditched us for"". I get little sleep, wake up and pack up camp, and head back to LA for the flight home.

About two weeks later I get a texts from her and her friend asking how I am etc. Romantically disinclined at this point, a pin I made, a small plastic dinosaur, some glass-wear from the lab I work in, a local news paper and a letter about where I come from. The receive the package and return it in the like. This is great. It's about June now and I am preparing another letter. The same day I mail it, I get a call. It's from the girl.

She starts casually asking how I am, and didn't know who to talk to. She called me because essentially I was this fictional character. Not in a bad way. Just someone she knew well enough to talk to, but didn't know her or her friends. A stranger you can trust, if such a thing exists. That night we talked for 4-5 hours. I couldn't sleep the whole night. I called her the next day after work, another 5 hours down. This continued for two weeks. At this point we were falling for each other. Even now I cringe to say that to people. I feel so childish. But it was real. Its amazing the type of relationship you can build when there is no physical aspect to blur your objectivity. We decided to visit. Her first, we'll split the ticket. 

When she arrived 10 days later, and things were great. She left sad, but hopeful.

We continued to visit every 2-3 weeks, and maybe she could just move to Salt Lake...

So we did it. 

She's lived here for a month now and we couldn't be happier. We a building future plans and daily realize how much we really love each other. If I told myself a year ago that I would meet the girl I am going to marry (believe me

[Some Photos along the way](http://imgur.com/a/dmUrJ)

So go for it. Dance with someone. Trade jellybeans for kisses. 

Also: wrap it up

I hope to see you there. May love guide you.

It's actually a cool gig, and we party hard for the last few hours of each night after we shut the booths down.  We also take turns leaving our post to see our favorite acts during the day. I get paid to largely enjoy the experience.

To be clear, but that's not my decision.

--------------------

EDIT for description of valid ID:

A valid ID must be issued by a government agency, height, sex, color of eyes and color of hair and the card owner’s signature. Under no circumstances can a valid ID be altered or expired. Examples of valid forms of ID can be a driver’s license, state ID card, military ID, passport or in some cases

--------------------

A few words to the wise...

1) The California Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) police will be on site at ID check booths randomly.  They are in plain clothes and do arrest people.  In fact at my booth alone last year

2) ID Checkers at Coachella are trained to spot fake IDs.  In fact, that means the high-end ID sellers, such as ID Chief.  If you see people looking at your ID with a magnifier and checking it for other things you probably never noticed, this is why.

3) ID Check people are instructed to keep your ID if it appears to be fake or borrowed.  If you are dumb enough to try to reclaim your fake ID when the ABC people happen to be in the booth, *walk away* and forget it.  Last year I watched a guy stand there and demand his ID back for like an hour, while the ABC people were away.  When the ABC people came back from citing a bunch of people, they busted him on the spot.  Dumb.

4) EDITED TO ADD INFO:  Fake ID is considered fraud

What I was told and witnessed at Coachella last year was that the ABC take you off site, nor do I know what the DA's office will do with you if you get busted. I don't believe they take away your access to the fest, but rules change every year at these shows. 

5) *You don't look like the person whose ID you borrowed.*  Unless you are a family member with ridiculously similar looks to the person on the ID, and our brains adjust to spotting even small differences in the photos very quickly. Especially the eyes.  Also keep in mind that the ABC will *keep* the legit ID of the person it was borrowed from, and potentially cite them as well.  You have been warned.

6) ID wristbands... the people who run the Coachella show can and will change the ID Check wristband without warning, and your old wristband will have to be replaced.  If you are going to drink, carry your ID with you into the show each day, or risk having to walk back to get it (some cases a very long distance) in what is going to be 95+ degree heat this year.

If your ID wristband looks like it has been taken from someone else (damaged, and we will have to ID you again to give you a new one. It doesn't matter if we saw that you already had one on.  We still have to card you.

Edit:  Much like bars

7) Psychology - The ABC people can spot a lot of faker ID holders while they are still in line.  Some of these people just clearly look too young, in my limited experience watching them.

8) Your memory sucks.  If there is some doubt about your ID, the address on the card, etc.  They busted a lot of people this way too. You will be under stress / mind-altered, and you will probably screw up.

9) Drugs... do not try to present a fake ID to get a bracelet while you are carrying your weed or whatever else.  You'll get busted for all of it

10) Be Nice.  Not every ID Checker is as gung-ho about checking ID as others at these booths

11) DRINK LOTS OF WATER! It's going to be hot! .....and SUNBLOCK!!

Hope this helps!!

There is some good information on the Coachella site [HERE](http://www.coachella.com/festival-info) and [HERE](http://www.coachella.com/travel-lodging/on-site-camping)

EDIT: I added everyone suggestions as of 2/5/13 and broke it down into different aspects of the festival. Some stuff is relevant to multiple aspects so I still recommend reading it all. No one has offered any information for people staying at hotels so I didn't add anything. Also I don't have anything specific about the actual music since I figure there is enough threads about the music already.

Some “essential” things I have read and compiled:

Preparation/Packing

* Build up your immune system before the festival – Vitamin C
* Wristband - Register it before you get there.
* Cash - I have read there are ATMs on the grounds but the lines get long and the fees are high.
* Refillable Water Bottle - There are a few free water bottle refilling stations inside the festival. Water station by the food court is usually pretty empty.
* Camel Back – The site says they are not allowed
* Bandana – Cover your mouth when it’s dusty/windy
* Backpack
* Car Charger - For phone/iPod
* Extra batteries - Phone
* Collapsible Chairs - For hanging out around the campsite.
* Pop Up EZ Shade - To get some shade at the campsite.
* Tent, Sheet/light blanket/sleeping bag - It gets cooler at night but it will be really hot early in the morning. They make tent locks in case you are worried someone will come inside your tent.
* Tie Downs/Stakes – Make sure your tents/pop up shades are secured so they don’t go flying in the wind.
* Toiletries – There are showers.
* Baby Wipes/Dry Shampoo – Make shift shower if the lines are too long
* Camping Shower – If you want a fancy make shift shower. If you can
* Sunscreen/SPF chapstick - This is mentioned a lot so it must be important.
* Toilet Paper/Flushable Wipes - Who knows if the port-o-potties will be stocked all weekend. Plus that one-ply stuff sucks.
* Ibuprofen/Advil/Aspirin/Pepto Bismol/Imodium - Just in case.
* Allergy Medicine - If you have allergies. There will be lots of dust, and cigarette smoke floating around.
* Saline nose spray – Clean out the nasty dry dirty boogers in the morning.
* Gastrolyte electrolyte powder packs - To mix into your H20
* Hand Sanitizer
* Condoms
* Small First Aid Kit
* Gold Bond Power – Sweaty balls
* Flashlight/headlamp/lantern - For the campground at night.
* Power inverter – If you’re camping and you want a couple power outlets.
* Jumper Cables – Inevitably someone will have a dead battery at the end of the weekend.
* Cooler with food/beer/booze/ice/dry ice – Dry ice helps keep your ice longer but it will freeze anything it touches. The line to buy ice can be really long. If you don't want to stand in long lines and eat expensive event food all weekend then bring food. NO glass allowed in the campground or the festival. ""Please remember that all packages
* Snack food – Power bar, etc. Easy stuff to snack on. Not allowed in the venue but good to have standing in line or in the morning.
* Ear Plugs/Sleep Mask - To help sleep at the campground.
* Duct Tape - Always good to have.
* Garbage Bags
* Small Blanket - For sitting on the grass at the festival.
* Camera - Take a photo of your contact information and have it on the camera in case you lose it. Maybe a good person will find it.
* Fun clothes – Accessories, face paint, group themes?
* Bathing Suit
* Hat - Sunburned scalp = no good
* Sunglasses
* Sweater/Jacket - Gets cooler at night.
* Comfortable Shoes - Bring a couple pairs if possible and rotate if they get sweaty/nasty. Sandals are bad in a group of thousands of people jumping all over up and down.
* WATER WATER WATER - Drink it, etc.
* Bring clothes you are comfortable in. It is fun to wear funny/interesting clothing as long as you realize you will be sweating
* Bring more than one set of keys to your car, but I’d rather stay on the safe side.
* Light up Totem – Useful for finding groups at the campsite and in the festival.
* You'll have a much better time if you prepare for Coachella in advance by listening to a lot of the music from all the bands you are thinking of seeing.

Camping

* It is a good idea to fill up your gas tank before you get to the festival. Who knows if you will need to run your car to charge your phone
* There is usually a ton of traffic into the venue
* Arrive in a caravan of cars. Figure out who you want to camp next to and meet at a gas station or restaurant in Indio and drive in together from there. The order of camping spots goes according to the order of the procession of cars. It is way more fun if you are camping in a big group than if you are all spread out
* If you have a smartphone with Google Maps, crowded and confusing, and you also don't leave the exact same way you go in, so it can be hard to find your car. Alternatively you can get a balloon with about 20ft of string and tie it to your car. Not sure how long it will last, but it is an option.
* There is a store at the campgrounds – Sells basic necessities including ice.
* Pre-game – Pace yourself, lines are long, etc. If you plan on drinking inside, get your bracelet as early as possible before the bracelet lines get a mile long.
* Shower at night. In the car camping lots, and you won’t feel gross immediately after showering.
* No Fires - No fires in the campgrounds. Propane stoves are the only cooking appliance allowed.
* Once you park your car you cannot leave and come back – There is a shuttle that will take you the Ralphs.

Inside the Grounds

* Security can be tight - This means longer wait times to get into the festival. Don't miss your favorite band because you're waiting in line. Make sure to plan accordingly. I have also read that security is more relaxed later in the afternoon if you’re planning on trying to smuggle anything in.
* Buy the t shirts/merch you want early - They sell out at night and the lines are very long.
* The tent bars are shaded and have air blowing inside in case you get overheated during the day. Also there are advertising tents that are air-conditioned.
* Last year there was a tent set up that had phone chargers
* Air Conditioned Trailers with Flushing Bathrooms – Between the Sahara and Mojave. Also inside the beer garden
* Don't be afraid to adventure on your own
* If you care about a band
* Realize you will be giving up on your expectations of personal space.
* Don't text ""Where are you?"" or any text that requires a response because by the time you get one, Time stamp your texts because ambiguous times like ""Meet me in 20 minutes"" doesn't mean a damn thing.
* Enjoy some of the other stuff - You’re obviously at Coachella for the music, beer gardens and a damn ferris wheel! You’re not going to have enough time to do everything, so when you do have time in between bands, rest and go around to check things out. Try a spicy pie.
* Don’t do anything you don’t want to. Don’t think that you’re not getting the full experience if you’re not doing some kind of crazy substance. Coachella is a world entirely of its own
* Accept the fact that you won’t see everyone you want to see. There are going to be conflicts. You’re going to miss someone that’s on your list of “acts I am seeing for sure”.
* Have fun, and enjoy good music

Misc

* If you plan on going to any hotel parties, etc. get on the guest lists.

As far as my situation is concerned

Hopefully everyone is able to get the tickets they need so they can party in the desert with friends come April.

EDIT: As sgreenha has reminded us: I have four GA Festival Passes that are linked to four Car Camping Passes

&gt;Please note: Camping passes are non transferable by themselves. They will only work when scanned with the festival pass it was ordered with originally. If you bought multiple festival passes and one camping pass


EDIT 2: SHIT

EDIT 3: So I've spoken to a few of you, so don't fret just yet. My group still has a few people who have weekend 1 passes, but they haven't decided if they will be able to go to weekend 2 yet (work, school, other crap...).

Yes general admission tickets are all sold out for both weekends. Don't worry. You can still go


* Do not buy the VIP or crazy-priced Eldorado and Sahara ticket packages.
* Do not start scouring Ebay or Stub Hub and bid on expensive tickets.
* Do not exchange sexual favors with people on craigslist for wristbands.
* Be patient and wait.

Right now is the worst time to buy tickets. Wait until mid to late March and check out Stub Hub and Ebay. Every year tickets drop to within $50-$100 of the face value because around this time people find out they can't go and big-time scalpers find themselves with a cache of tickets they need to unload. 

I've watched this happen every year since 2007 when I bought tickets off of Ebay at face value two weeks before the festival... this was after tickets sold out in January and were going for up to $2

We've continued working on it since then

To give you a quick overview of what Falcon does:

 * It has a navigation tool based on a compass. It points you towards your destination and gives you distance

 * You can save any location -like your tent or car spot - with just a couple of taps

 * A complete in-app messaging system lets you share messages, like all the stages) with your friends who use the app.

 * Your shared locations get autofilled with time and date so if it's received late (we've all dealt with shitty reception)

 * Stages will include set times for easy reference.

 * The locations and info are all crowdsourced

The newest Coachella map isn't in there yet

You can [download it from the app store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/falcon/id506151543?mt=8) for free. It's iOS only right now

And in case you wanna stay posted on future developments

Minutes later I go to buy a bag of ice and I see the same two security officers taking the drugs along with BAGS of other drugs they had confiscated from other campers to the information booth where I was standing. These amnesty boxes are emptied and given to runners that go and re-sell the drugs to festival goers to make money.
I've reported this to Indio Police which reported it to Goldenvoice. They seemed to be pretty interested in what I knew. If you get caught with anything you'll most likely be scammed into handing it over instead of having an actual police officer do it who has to take a report. I talked to a worker who was so high on percocet 5 and free beer from campers that he continued to try to pick up a single piece of trash in 37 mph winds for a few minutes straight. Da fuq is going on at Coachella?

I'm convinced that there's some kind of drug ring going on amongst the security there. If you see this going on report it to the police there. Taking your stash is one thing but turning around and selling it is just a whole other level of wrong. Don't be too confident smoking in the camp ground.

[Glastonbury has one](https://glastonbury.seetickets.com/Registration/Register) and it works perfectly. All it takes is a simple registration system

But in reality you don't care. You're more concerned with manufacturing hype, they push people into buying VIP passes *cause it's only a few dollars more than regular passes on eBay.* 

You could fix all these problems but instead you have one of the easiest systems for scalpers to circumvent. Last year you sold out in record time. But the dirty secret no one is mentioning; during the month leading up to this year's festival tickets were selling at cost. Why? Because there really wasn't the crazy demand. It was all created by the secondary market. So Goldenvoice keep screwing over the real Coachella fans for a quick buck. Sooner or later your hype is going fade away.

* The Activities Tent in Car Camping - lots of hard-working people help you to make buttons, make iPhone cases, and read Zines while a DJ spins.  We had a great time here on Friday!

* The Farmer's Marker in Car Camping - I'm all about that Green Drink.

* JBL Tent - Free Coffee

* Get to know your neighbors - Before going to Coachella

* People Watch - we had a ton of fun watching the bad mushroom trips in the charging tent on Saturday night.  I also played a fun game called ""What Are They On?"".  

* Walk around car camping - saying ""Happy Coachella!"" and getting hugs from strangers.  Coachella is probably the friendliest place on earth.

* Drugs.

* Zia Records - the staff was rude and unhelpful

* Crab Fries.

EDITS:

* Use the charging lockers (they're to the right when you walk into the festival, and your phone is safe!

* Bring a game and play it with strangers.  The dudes across the way from us had a bunch of buckets and a softball, dehydrated hung over people miss entire mornings).

* Watch the hippos / snail / sharks / balloon chain carrier guys / performers at the Do Lab.  Coachella is full of oddities and freak shows

* Watch the sun rise.

* Pick your sunset band carefully.  My highlight came in the form of Portugal. The Man performing The Sun at sunset.  It was blissful.

* Spicy Pie - worth the lines and the screaming shits it will give you.

* Sharing with others.  We brought a shit-ton of food with us, brought over some weed, and offered us all kinds of love.  The generosity at the festival is inspiring.  

* Talk to people.  Talk about where people are from, what they like, etc.  Getting to know strangers was a big part of my successful Coachella.

* Rage.  I'm not into this, drink, party, have sex (wear a condom) and then do it again.  

* Don't rage.  The beauty of Coachella is that everyone experiences it differently.  There are no two identical Coachellas, the serendipitous way of life all comes together to create a perfectly unique and timeless experience for you.

I've been attending Coachella since 04 and I have some tips for newcomers that I don't believe have been brought up in other tip threads. These delve a little deeper than the obvious ""bring sun screen and drink water"" tips. A couple of these require being somewhat of a douche

-When entering the parking lot

-Starting a couple years ago, but they moved the middle barrier waayyyy to the left so now hardly any people can fit left of it. The #1 best place to stand at the main stage is on the right side of the now ""left justified middle barrier"" up against the railing to your left. When you approach the right side of the stage, the amount of people may seem intimidating, but if you can get past the casuals all the way to the railing, you'll see that it's actually very chill and lots of room to move around and sit down between sets.

-Arrive early Friday and Saturday

-If any companies are offering edible freebies (gum, especially if you have a backpack with you. One year, I got tons that free gum they were giving out and it really helped at times when I was at a stage with no access to water. It got the saliva flowing again.

-For the BEST cheap Mexican food in Indio

-Don't waste your money boozing it up on shit-quality expensive beer at the festival. Best bar in the area is the Beer Hunter in La Quinta. This place has a HUGE beer selection

-Loot the recycle containers for people's used water bottles and turn em in to get free water.  I know this sounds shady

-If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, it may be in your best interest to wear a bandanna, shirt or breathing mask over your nose/mouth as much as possible or you will get ""Coachella Sickness""...this is where you are bedridden sick and hacking brown saliva for the week following the festival.

-If you have a short attention span

-If you're going to drink

-SIT DOWN as much as possible during the day. You will be thanking yourself when you are able to stand 2 hours for the headliner because you preserved your leg/foot strength by not standing for Biffy Clyro.

-I know I'll get flamed for this

-Eating food at the festival can be so hit and miss. Most of the food I've bought is total crap and overpriced. Spicy Pie is all hype

-Only wear sandals if you don't plan on getting close to stages to watch bands or if you plan on standing for long periods of time to watch bands. For that you will need comfortable cushioned footwear. I typically go with running shoes with insoles.

-This will make me sound like a TOTAL tool, I brought in one that made me about 6"" taller...nothing that really sticks out....greatest..thing...ever....and yes I did share it with short people standing next to me.

-WATCH OUT FOR COPS ALONG HWY 111 AFTER THE SHOW! One year I got a $300 cell phone ticket. And so you don't give them a hassle

-Finally, circus dogs, 90-year old jizz moppers and a fat guy in the corner named Jimbob who will draw a caricature of you that looks nothing like you.

* bring A LOT of water and a good water bottle. You wont be able to bring the full bottles of water into the grounds but you will need them for breakfast (its the hottest when you wake up IMO) and anytime you are not in the festival
* bring a small bag. it will make everything better. 
* sunblock. sunblock. sunblock
* **bring something to cover your face**
* bring the amount of money you think you are going to spend and a little extra. never know if you are going to need it.
* you dont have to get into the festival as soon as the gates open in the morning
* for the bands you want to see, go 2 bands before
* i recommend wearing sandals or some light colored shoes. i had brought some brown slip-ons and my feet were still on fire during the day
* if its anything like last year
* bring a sweater for the night time
* the best time to charge your phone is very early in the morning

UPDATE:
here is a more organized list of essentials to carry at all times:

* small bag
* sunglasses or hat
* sunblock
* toilet paper
* water bottle
* your list of bands on the set list for that day
* Bandana or light scarf

TNGHT had sound issues (I think) but otherwise they'd probably be on this list too cuz they're awesome. 

Andreilien in the DoLab was amazing.

I wasted the Sigur Ros show like an idiot because of the Daft Punk rumors during the Phoenix set. Yeah yeah I know. We all knew. But for some reason nobody believed it even when Phoenix was over we were all standing there for a few minutes AFTER the wall home music turned on thinking ""here it come

If you haven't already noticed Unicorn Kid is not at Coachella. This was a huge let down and I didn't notice until we were already there.

The last 10 minutes of Bassnectar were kick ass! The first part of the set was a little disappointing. 

Moby's set is very ""house"". Great set just not what I was expecting.

I spent the entire weekend trying to get into the Yuma Tent and never made it. If there is anyone you want to see get there really early. Seriously the lines were always a mess

If you're staying ""walking distance"" from the festival bring really comfortable shoes. We were super close to the festival (probably less than 3/4 mile line of sight from the Ferris wheel at Indian Palms County Club) and the way they route you makes for a little more than a 2 mile walk. So yeah not so bad coming in but we were walking for a solid hour and then some every night to get home. Of course if you have VIP tickets you can ignore this your walk was pretty direct.

I hear I missed by not seeing Birdy Nam Nam.

The Spanish Paella was surprisingly good. The Fried chicken in the food court next to the pizza place (can't remember the name but it was Asian style) was killer!

If you like electronic stuff make sure to walk (or better yet dance) through the DoLab any chance you get. It was always worth the extra steps.

If you're taking a taxi or getting dropped off

Beer is $7 for what appears to be 12oz

Sidewalk's End is a great perch for the outdoor stage if both that and the main stage are not going at once.

Bring a bandanna for the dust. You may not need it but you'll wish you had it if the winds pick up. Also Coachella's merch tent was blessed with a windy/chilly night where thousands (including myself) went to throw $50 towards an ugly/oversized sweatshirt. That's all that was left by the time I got there.

1356543516.0,15h44n,Notes on the SS Coachella,sedriss,33,2,7,"Thought I'd start a thread on the boat to get some commentary from the other folks who were present.  My notes:

* The boat is very much Indio on the high seas, and he is right that it really did infer the same sense of wonderment present every April in the desert.

* Having been on both cruises

* The crowd was mostly behaved.  On the first leg

* The food is ample, QSine, and Lawn Club were all delicious, but a 40$ cover charge to get in is way too pricey for the quality of the food.  I did not pay to go on the cruise so I didn't mind paying to eat, but if I had paid I would be pretty pissed at being charged even more.

* Shore excursion pricing in Bahamas was a rip-off (125$ for a day trip to the Atlantis resort?) but very reasonable in Jamaica (110$ for an all-day river tubing and falls-climbing extravaganza complete with boat ride and lunch.)

* The 325 of us who did both cruises (GV employees, band crew, and some regular passengers who took the last-minute offer to pay 250$ to stay for the next cruise) ended up having to wait two hours on the dock in Fort Lauderdale for all of the passengers too drunk to get out of bed to be evicted from the ship.  I sat next to Father John Misty's guitarist.  We booed them as they fled.

* Grimes did not know how to play bingo on the first leg.  I did manage to win a boombox from her on the second leg

* The shows in the main theater were never full enough.  I think that's because the boats are purposefully designed to have so much space for so few people that even when fully loaded nobody is in the same place at the same time.  It did give the Pulp

* The idea of being on a boat with the artists for the duration of your trip and running into them and congratulating them on their sets really inferred a great sense of togetherness.  At his last set

* Very few people paid to be on this ship.  I think though that if they do this next year (I did hear whisperings about that beyond what was said at the GV panel)

(Dollars values in this story are approximate, and that according to CA Civil code the hotel was required to reimburse us three times the amount. I was very polite and specific! The receptionist tried to hush me so the other guests waiting in line would not hear. I don't like being hushed, so I turned around and started explaining it to the other guests.

#1 - BE A GOOD NEIGHBOR (all other reminders are some version of this)

#2 - SHOWER EVERY MORNING - This is not about YOUR comfort

#3 - SMOKE POLITELY - Seriously. Blow your smoke directionally directly upward, because there are eyeballs nearby.

#4 - DON'T OVER-CROWD - If you want to be up-close for your favorite band

Don't be a greedy pig and spoil the show for someone else

#5 - DON'T GET SUPER-CLOSE UNLESS YOU WANNA DANCE - Save the closest standing spots for the people who want to romp around. (Obviously

#6 - OBEY NOISE CURFEWS - Be a good camper, when your neighbors might be getting back from the headliner and want to sleep.) There is a Silent Dance Party, where you wear your headphones and can burn-off your high, every night in the campgrounds from 1:30am - 3:30am.

#7 - LEAVE THE TOILETS IN THE BEST POSSIBLE CONDITION - Don't poo on the seat

#8 - DON'T LINE-JUMP IN ANY LINE - There is plenty of time for everyone to get into the fest and to get their food. Plan ahead. The people ahead of you planned ahead

#9 - DON'T THROW TRASH INTO CROWDS - What were you

#10 - DON'T LEAR AT THE WOMENFOLK! - They are not dressed that way for you. Coachella is not a Male Gaze Free-For All. Don't be a creep.

#11 - KEEP AN EYE OUT - If you see someone who looks in a bad way

Just remember... IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT YOU. There are tens of thousands of people who also want to enjoy Coachella. It's not about how YOU want to live and how YOU want to behave and when YOU get what you want. We're all getting sunstroke together

It's About Your Neighbors. The fest is great because of tens of thousands of people sharing art and music harmoniously. Don't be the discordant mouthbreather who spoils it for others.",self,t5_2qsp9,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/1b1s9w/be_a_good_neighbor_at_coachella/

These delve a little deeper than the obvious ""bring sun screen and drink water"" tips. A couple of these require being somewhat of a douche

1. When entering the parking lot

2. Starting last year, but they moved the middle barrier waayyyy to the left so now hardly any people can fit left of it.  The #1 best place to stand at the main stage is on the right side of the now ""left justified middle barrier"" up against the railing to your left.  When you approach the right side of the stage, the amount of people may seem intimidating, but if you can get past the casuals all the way to the railing, you'll see that it's actually very chill and lots of room to move around and sit down between sets.

3. Arrive early every day

4. If any companies are offering edible freebies (gum, especially if you have a backpack with you. Last year, I got tons that free gum they were giving out and it really helped at times when I was at a stage with no access to water. It got the saliva flowing again.

5. I know this will be controversial

6. For the BEST cheap Mexican food in Indio

7. Don't waste your money boozing it up on shit-quality expensive beer at the festival. Best bar in the area is the Beer Hunter in La Quinta. This place has a HUGE beer selection

8. Loot the recycle containers for people's used water bottles and turn em in to get free water.

9. If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, it may be in your best interest to wear a bandanna, shirt or breathing mask over your nose/mouth as much as possible or you will get ""Coachella Sickness""...this is where you are bedridden sick and hacking brown saliva for the week following the festival.

10. If you have a short attention span

11. If you're going to drink

12. SIT DOWN as much as possible during the day. You will be thanking yourself when you are able to stand 2 hours for the headliner because you preserved your leg/foot strength by not standing for Neon Indian.

13. I know I'll get flamed for this

14. Eating food at the festival can be so hit and miss. Most of the food I've bought is total crap. If you want to play it really safe and make sure you don't feel ripped off

15.  If at all possible

16.  Only wear sandals if you don't plan on getting close to stages to watch bands or if you plan on standing for long periods of time to watch bands.  For that you will need comfortable cushioned footwear.  I typically go with running shoes with insoles.

17. Finally, bring in a small footstool in your backpack that will make you SLIGHTLY taller when watching bands.  Last year, I brought in one that made me about 6"" taller...nothing that really sticks out....greatest..thing...ever....and yes I did share it with short people standing next to me.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/ofsbj/unique_coachella_advice/

I thought of a few for now



**Camping**

* Buy what you think will be enough cases of water bottles

* Get something that you can see from a distance to identify your campground. Flags are cool for this. This will help you avoid extra misery when you drag whats left of yourself back to camp every night (or morning).

* Glass bottles and hard liquor will get thrown out. Water bottles = storage.

* Budget extra money for buying ice. (Unless you enjoy your beer as hot as your tea)

* Bring something to provide shade.

* It will be pushing 100 degrees by 8am every day. The nights are a gamble. They can either be freezing or warm.

* Bring a power strip with you. When you're running around trying to find an outlet to charge your phone

* Bring variation in food. (tothebatcave)

* Smokers. Bring extra Cigs as you will run out sooner than you think and a pack at the GS is about 10 bucks. Though there are shuttles to the market throughout the day. (tothebatcave)

* Baby wipes. (tothebatcave)

* Dry Ice instead



**Coachella**

* If you want to be up front in the Sahara

* Find the free shit. There was a tent handing out free packs of 5 gum last year.

* If you want to be up front for a certain performer

* Go to the Do Lab. Doesn't matter who's playing. Just go.

* If you're 21+

* Talk to strangers.

* Leave space open in your schedule to explore artists and the other attractions.

* Take breaks or you will be exhausted by the time the headliner comes on.

* Do yourself a favor and get a frozen lemonade. (tothebatcave)

* There is a ""secret"" indoor bathroom by the left side of Sahara that never has lines. (kenmixtape)

* Non-Californians

1334731723.0,sfnvm,Car Camping: Suggested arrival times and plan of attack (including security advice),Aimsworthy,22,0,26,"My experience:
I arrived at 8:30 on Thursday morning and was 5 rows from the entrance (aka. Super effin close).  The shitty part was waiting 30 minutes for the gate to open.  20 minutes for them to figure their shit out and then we waited for our friends which lasted another 45 minutes getting us finally there by approximately 10:00 and our spot was perfection.  I would advise against trying to be first in line because you have two probable scenarios 
1) you will find yourself being a main pathway for lazy assholes that want to cut through tents to get to their site
2) you will find yourself right next to a main path which will most likely contain portapoties and heavy foot traffic.  

If you really want to ensure a good spot

Car Entrance Security:
Basically the procedure is as follows...   They will ask you to take everything out of your car and make you pop your hood. They will search consoles, etc.  they will then do a quick search through all of your bags as good as the security person you get wants to be (either very through or absolutely laxidasical)   

Basically don't be an idiot and you should be okay (ie. don't hotbox your car while waiting in line).  If you can keep it in your pants and not smoke on the drive you are ensuring a greater probability for ease of passage. 

- don't bring in handles of alcohol. Put it in water bottles.  They won't check if they are sealed. 
- they will make you throw knives away (even food prepping knives and camping leathermans) so either hide them well or don't bring them in
- minimal amount of effort is needed to hide anything. Any kind of creativity and you will be fine.  Just use the nooks and crannies of your car
- they will make you pop your hood so that is not a good spot.  

If you need crafty ideas pm me and I'll tell you what to do for success.

""This year there will be a new tent at Coachella called Yuma. It is basically to address the lost art of the DJ which has been eclipsed by this overblown EDM shows. They are trying to present DJs in more of a pure form. So it is going to have a wooden dance floor and be air-conditioned. It’s going to get away from the big LED screens and present DJs closer to the audience. You will be able to see mixing. It will feel more like a nightclub.""

I've been attending Coachella since 04 and I have some tips for newcomers that I don't believe have been brought up in other tip threads. These delve a little deeper than the obvious ""bring sun screen and drink water"" tips. A couple of these require being somewhat of a douche

-When entering the parking lot

-Starting last year, but they moved the middle barrier waayyyy to the left so now hardly any people can fit left of it. The #1 best place to stand at the main stage is on the right side of the now ""left justified middle barrier"" up against the railing to your left. When you approach the right side of the stage, the amount of people may seem intimidating, but if you can get past the casuals all the way to the railing, you'll see that it's actually very chill and lots of room to move around and sit down between sets.

-Arrive early every day

-If any companies are offering edible freebies (gum, especially if you have a backpack with you. Last year, I got tons that free gum they were giving out and it really helped at times when I was at a stage with no access to water. It got the saliva flowing again.

-I know this will be controversial, avoid camping.

-For the BEST cheap Mexican food in Indio

-Don't waste your money boozing it up on shit-quality expensive beer at the festival. Best bar in the area is the Beer Hunter in La Quinta. This place has a HUGE beer selection

-Loot the recycle containers for people's used water bottles and turn em in to get free water.

-If you're allergic to cigarette smoke, it may be in your best interest to wear a bandanna, shirt or breathing mask over your nose/mouth as much as possible or you will get ""Coachella Sickness""...this is where you are bedridden sick and hacking brown saliva for the week following the festival.

-If you have a short attention span

-If you're going to drink

-SIT DOWN as much as possible during the day. You will be thanking yourself when you are able to stand 2 hours for the headliner because you preserved your leg/foot strength by not standing for Neon Indian.

-I know I'll get flamed for this

-Eating food at the festival can be so hit and miss. Most of the food I've bought is total crap. If you want to play it really safe and make sure you don't feel ripped off

-Only wear sandals if you don't plan on getting close to stages to watch bands or if you plan on standing for long periods of time to watch bands. For that you will need comfortable cushioned footwear. I typically go with running shoes with insoles.

-This will make me sound like a TOTAL tool, I brought in one that made me about 6"" taller...nothing that really sticks out....greatest..thing...ever....and yes I did share it with short people standing next to me.

-WATCH OUT FOR COPS ALONG HWY 111 AFTER THE SHOW!  Last year I got a $300 ticket for talking on my cell phone while driving.  And so you don't give them a hassle

-Finally, circus dogs, 90-year old jizz moppers and a fat guy in the corner named Jimbob who will draw a caricature of you that looks nothing like you.",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/rg455/unique_coachella_advice_repost/

I used to live in Texas so I know how to dress for the heat, but duh I also want to look cute. Also heels are so out, I'm pretty sure nobody gives a shit and I don't want to break my neck as I drink my way through the festival. So I was thinking things that are low maintenaince i.e. wrinkling not a problem. Things I've thought of:

* Sundresses
* Shorts
* Tanks
* Halter tops
* Sandals for dayzzzz
* Hats?

Then I know the temperature change ain't nothing to fuck with so what do you bring in with you so you don't freeze but also something that's not too bulky? I hate lugging stuff around.

I have a pretty small camelbak/backpak combo that I brought into the festival everyday. Since I came in via the shuttles (additional bag search), I happily unzipped all the pockets except for this one, and nobody seemed to notice. Personally I don't know how successful I would have been if it had been full, but I've read that people have been successful with this in the past. If you were planning on filling it with water, just wait til you're inside, it's really no hassle filling it up.

As for the water stations, the water pressure is great and I waited between zero and 15 seconds each day. I think the key is selecting the correct water station. This won't mean much to first timers until you get there, but the best water station IMO is where the two long rows of food stands meet in the Terrace. There just wasn't anyone there, even in the middle of the day. I would walk from there towards the Mojave tent, and at the edge of the terrace there is another water station that was always mobbed with people. I made a habit of informing some of them that a 30 second walk would take them to another station and save them 10 minutes of waiting, but I'm not sure if they believed me.

I think if you can get over the fact that it's on your back all day, but last year at Bonnaroo all my friends who didn't drink water felt terrible in the heat but I was able to tolerate it much better with 100 fluid ounces on my back. Not to mention, it's pretty great not having to hold a water bottle. As for the taste of polyurethane in the water, it's tolerable as long as you change the water out every 4 hrs or so.

FRIDAY
I decided not to watch Stone Roses because I decided that Friday I would stick to EDM for reasons.  For any weekend 2ers I highly recommend doing the following: watch opening of Wolfgang gartner

SATURDAY (spoilers - can't figure out how to do a spoiler tag from alien blu)
PHOENIX WAS UNBELIEVABLE.  I was a little confused on why these guys were headlining when I first saw the lineup, it does. Phoenix was definitely my favorite headliner


SUNDAY (minor spoilers)
As expected RHCP fucking killed it. For anyone expecting something crazy like the Tupac hologram

My favorite acts (in no order )
- Phoenix
- Of monsters and men 
- pretty lights

Other notable artists
- purity ring 
- vampire weekend
- WU tang
- Adrian lux
- I heard amazing things about Alt-J
- heard amazing things about Hardwell
- Moby

Caught their set in 2010 and it was phenomenal. They know how to entertain a crowd.

-Tame Impala

Their most recent album was one of my favorites from last year and I can't wait to see it live. Really hoping they extend out a lot of songs and change up some things. I love it when the live versions are noticeably different.

-Yeah Yeah Yeahs

Never was a big fan until recently. Always knew them for 'Zero' and 'maps'

-Sigur Ros

Really hoping for a night time outdoor set on this one. If you haven't listened to them yet

Like many other festival goers, and my understanding is that they're pretty serious with security early in the day on Thursday and they get lazier as the day progresses. How thorough are they with their searches on Thursday morning? Can I expect the inconvenience of all my bags taken out and looked through? Will they search in *every* nook and crannie in my car?

What're the benefits of getting there early in the day? Benefits of getting there later in the day?

I'm in a group of about 5 cars

A few of us (6 people, leave April 17) since we've heard it gets way too hot camping. Hopefully some veterans can help us answer a few questions:

1. Is weekend 1 typically better? Bigger demand?
2. How is the shuttle from Palm Springs? We are thinking of getting a place there because it will be a lot cheaper. Specifically
3. What are some things to do around the Desert area besides the festival? We'll have a few days before and after. Thinking of some golf and checking out Joshua Tree Park so far.
4. Any other tips/suggestions for first timers?

Thanks in advance!

EDIT: We've camped at Shambhala (festival in BC, we are pretty set on renting a house because a) we'll be here for a few days before and after the festival and will need a place anyway, and b) it's a huge pain to bring all our camping gear down with us on the plane, and c) a couple of my friends are pussies and won't be able to handle it :P

Anyways, La Quinta or Palm Desert before settling on Palm Springs. We don't have our tickets yet either, but I'll make sure everyone is online at the time they go on sale so we that we can hopefully snag some. Not planning on booking the house until we have tickets (just in case we have to switch to weekend 2).",,False,self,t5_2qsp9,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Coachella/comments/162l2v/coachella_virgins_coming_from_canada_have_some/

SOLUTION ---- THE TOTEM!

What is a totem

It's not quite as simple as you'd think though. There are several very important things you should keep in mind.

1. No flags or banners of any kind will be allowed into Coachella. This kinda sucks

2. Don't be a douche. Pick something that isn't going to block the people behind you. 

3. Be creative. I've seen all sorts of good stuff; a lightup penguin, DOMO, etc... A good totem can serve as an additional attraction to festival goers if it's done right. 

4. Be original. Do something that is unique to you. I'll be throwing up my lightup Manu Ginobili bobblehead

5. Put lights on it

**tl;dr** let's help each other figure out which sets they'll wanna catch based on categorization of music and/or relating bands to other more popular bands.

*******************************

A fellow Coachella goer and I were having a discussion about how it'd be helpful to have the lineup pre-divided into categories to help people figure out which new bands they'll enjoy seeing.  I've thrown together a few huge playlists in spotify and have been trying to listen through them

To make the point of this a little more clear...

Let's say I knew nothing about Radiohead (**hypothetically**).  I throw together a playlist including a few tracks from each band at Coachella and I land on 3 songs off of King of Limbs.  This is definitely *not* representative of what Radiohead has to offer

The best solution is for everyone to listen to every artist's entire discography and judge for themselves whether to show up to a set... but most of us are human and have jobs/school and whatnot.  So

Also

&gt; Black Lips – Stupid band for stupid people. VICE Recordings never puts out anything worthwhile. Except maybe DFA1979 but even they only had two good songs. Am I supposed to be impressed how they make out on stage with each other or pee in one another’s mouths? Write a good song. Then I’ll pay attention.

How is that supposed to help someone who's into garage rock and has never heard of the Black Lips?  Or
