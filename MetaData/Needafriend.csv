I moved across the country from my parents 3 years ago and am just now feeling homesick. I just came back to my own place after 3 weeks of being home (I am in college) and it's like it just hit me that I'll never live with my family again. My mom has been bipolar and depressed my whole life and has only recently been medicated/gotten help. I think that part of this depression is that while I was home, she and my father began to discuss adopting one of her students. It makes me feel abandoned. I often feel like screaming, ""I want my mom!"" and then bawling like a little kid. This regression and emotional instability is making it hard for me to go job hunting. I was supposed to take an online class this summer and just never signed in. I just desperately grab at things that I think will make me feel better, but nothing really works.

To compound this, which I did. It was the worst year of my life. My grandmother is an alcoholic and bipolar, and she poisons people. Namely, me. She used to be a nurse and tried to feed me strange medicines all year. She made me eggs on the day of my college orientation, during which I became violently ill. When I asked her about it, she said, ""It was the eggs. They were really old

I'm also working on my health. A little over a year ago I started going on regular walks with my dog.

My name is Lauren. I've been horribly lonely for a very long time

I'm a military brat. I've lived in California, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and New York. I've also lived in Okinawa, Japan, and Wiesbaden, Germany.

Right now I work two jobs and I have a lot of coworkers that I get along with

I don't drink. I don't smoke. I don't party. I've never wanted to either.

I just like to play games.

For the computer

I used to play Ragnarok Online

I don't have an XBox360

I have a horribly strong love of cetaceans and the ocean

Some of my favorite games include Ocarina of Time, Skyrim,  Nier, Star Ocean: Till the End of Time, and FFX. For whatever reason, I love FFX. I love the story. I don't hate Tidus the way that a lot of other people seem to, though his voice can be a bit grating. I never played FFX-2 because it ruined the story. To me

I've read and love Harry Potter, though sometimes I wish I could read more. I've read the Twilight series and I didn't hate it (sorry), but I can see why it wouldn't appeal to a lot of people.

I used to watch a lot of anime, and Mushishi is the shit, though it took getting older to really appreciate it. Ginko is a badass.

Some of my favorite movies include 21 Jump Street, and God Bless America (I LOVE THIS MOVIE).

I love South Park's type of humor. Out of every humorous show

I essentially grew up on Sailor Moon obsessively. I still love it. I've watched the anime, but if I could have, I would have. I did see a bit on youtube.

I played Pokemon for a good portion of my childhood and still love the series, though no Pokemon tops Lugia or Articuno.

As for music, I will have no idea what you're talking about.

Some of my current favorite songs:

Pendulum - Self Vs Self (feat. In Flames)
Malrun - Pariah
Eyes Set to Kill - Broken Frames
Pierce the Veil - Caraphernelia
10 Years - Fix Me (but really
Janus - Always Rains
Oceana - The Family Disease
DMC3 - Devils Never Cry
Five Finger Death Punch - Coming Down
Cold Driven - The Wicked Side of Me
Celldweller - Eon
Lynyrd Skynyrd - Unbroken

I also love documentaries a buttload. Stuff like The History Channel and National Geographic are awesome, which makes me sad and disappoints me greatly.

I get depressed a lot. I feel that the military stole my childhood

I'm a very picky eater. Namely because I hate vegetables. Some favorite food places include: Taco Bell, Oishii Bento, COCO'S CURRY, El Meson, PF Changs, and a few other places that I can't remember the names to because it's been so long since I've  been able to go.
I also love to draw

I'm not religious in any sort of way. If anything

I do like symbolism

There’s just been something on my mind that was caused by one of the episodes. At the end of the second episode of the first season, and covers it all up by presenting a limbo that Jay was going to use with Gloria on their get away when Manny was with his dad. But instead

This made me depressed. Why? Because I know what it feels like to have a father that constantly cancel whatever plans he made for the two of us to do. I recently came to realize that I stopped going to my dads house as often because he always did this. I’m 19 now, I didn’t go every other weekend. He would cancel on me, and when I did go over, I’d have to sleep on the living room couch because the other room was for the lady’s son who he married. She’s not my step-mom and he’s not my step-brother. They made no effort to try to get along with me, so therefore they are nothing to me. The only thing I will never get that Manny got is having someone cover up my father’s lack of time for me. My mom never cover up what my father was doing, she just came out and said it. “Your dads an asshole. Oh well.” It took me several years to realize it but, my father doesn’t want me in his life. I have just been a financial burden to him. He’s missed so many important moments of my life. It’s heartbreaking to think that the people who should love you the most don’t care for you. It’s also depressing to think that if I didn’t exist, “don’t say that” but in all honesty

1341382890.0,w0qzw,Took a shot in the dark with this subreddit. Kinda shocked I actually guessed there was one called /r/needafriend,SecurityCop,11,1,8,"So I just created this account. Literally to post here. Not sure how long of a post this will be

I'm not depressed, when I'm dead, the only people who will remember me will be family, which is nice I guess, but had I never existed, nothing will ever be significantly different. Sure a few friends might have been lonelier at times, but they would have gotten over it.

I live in Canada, but I live in the nice area. However, I work at a store that's near the worse area of the city. This being the case, we get some of the worst customers in our store, whether they're extremely impatient, rude, yell, language barrier, it adds up to being trouble giving smiles out while being on customer service. 

I recently broke up with my girlfriend. It was mutual, but it's difficult, as I still love her, and her texting me nearly every day makes things harder. Not that I would ever tell her to stop, because I want to be friends too.

I'm still going to school, they take their tole. My dad is reclusive (like me) and so he does not enjoy me having friends over often. They also do not like me going out and staying out for a night, which is more difficult.

I mentioned I am reclusive. Well that being the case, at the moment, my only friends I can talk to are a) my friend from school who lives an hour away and is a guy. (I don't talk about personal things with guys. I always feel women are more understanding) b) my ex. c) my friend from work who now has feelings for me so she doesn't want to see me because she has a boyfriend and d) my best friend from work who is moving farther away because she and her boyfriend broke up.

After my ex and I broke up

I just want someone to talk to. It would actually mean a lot to me

In my free time I have done many things. I try to be creative, specifically of the pop punk and heavy rock variety (http://www.last.fm/user/DrStatic). I’ve been playing various instruments since I was a teenager and am currently writing a punk/lo-fi/indie/new wave concept album about an alien sending a message to Earth in the form of an album. I read way too many comic books, but my love for spandex and capes is not as prominent as it used to be. Creator-owned comics are gifts from the heavens. I thoroughly enjoy video games and am an amateur speed runner, but who knows if I’ll ever go anywhere with that? My tastes in movies and TV are malleable and I have enjoyed many things in the past and this will probably continue into the future. I probably like whatever nerd show you like, unless it’s the Walking Dead. Sorry, I’m not into zombies.

I work a job that I hate, but I wish they were as organized as my record collection.

Here’s the thing, I’d like to discover who I am outside of my tastes. Largely I’ve used this to define myself and they have been the basis for the majority of my conversations for quite some time. I’ll admit that I’ve struggled with depression lately, but my major cause of anxiety is lack of social interaction. (And a bit of “fear of the future”, but that’s not something I can fix so easily.) My conversation skills have been defined as “lacking”, but I’d like to make a general effort to change that.

I am friendly to all types, all sexualities. Counter-culture types are my normal friends. Punks, hippies, druggies, vegans and such. I lean to the left more than most people, but I don’t prefer to talk about politics all the time, it just makes me sad.

Who you are:
Biggest qualifier: You are willing to talk to me.
Gender: Who cares. I’m not expecting sexy replies. 
Interests: I shall forever hope to meet some nice people with similar interests to mine
Personality: I tend not to get along well with people who like to start arguments. A casual conversation where we disagree is fine

Bonus points if you can ask me a question that legitimately makes me think.

First area is someone who will listen to me about things such as deppression

Second area is someone to talk about shows, Legend of Zelda, Avatar: The Last Airbender, Pokemon, and Friendship is Magic. I am also currently watching Sherlock. I enjoy all types of things, even though this list is rather limited, so feel free to ask about anything!

The last area is someone to have deep, with topics such as time, space, and fate; it will mostly be for discussing either different or similar ideas and such about the topics, what kinds of things you believe is true, and things such as that.

Also I really enjoy creative activities such as drawing or writing

I have a tumblr, and deviantart as well if you would like to communicate over something other than reddit.

I got in contact with the mods who said it was okay to make a post here about a new subreddit you can check out /r/randomactsofcards. It's a new subreddit to either give or receive cards to anyone who wants one. It can also be a good way to make a new friend.

One of my close friendships started with a card. I sent a deployed soldier in Afghanistan a card. It took a month before he unexpectedly replied back. From there it went to Facebook friends

So if you get a chance come check out /r/randomactsofcards. Make an offer or a request. Do a card swap if you like. Look through other posts to see what people's interests are and comment on it if you have something in common. You never know what might happen. :)

I'm really weird, I have an absurdly scattered personality, opinions, and tastes and that's been my big problem my whole life, I've never easily fit into any category or group. Since I've been such a troubled outcast my whole life I've dedicated it to studying philosophy, psychology, and art to try to understand and relate to all the people in the world that never made any sense to me.

I like to think of myself as a particularly intellectual and caring individual who always tries to do his best to help and please the people around me but I'm almost always left feeling like I'm unappreciated, understanding friend to share our stories with
each other. Someone willing to go through some ups and downs together.

I think I'm really cool and interesting once you get to know me, I'd just feel anxious about something else instead. Trying to hold on to my last bit of hope I suppose, before that slips away from me. Anyone who thinks I don't sound lame should add my Facebook page, I like to think I've put a good amount of work into using it to express myself. http://www.facebook.com/alexanderreed (Facebook isn't even cool anymore is it? Oh, well.) 

Sidenote: Almost all of my closest friends have been females, supportive people even if they don't have as much directly in common with me. The one male best friend that I had and lived with for two years agree'd with me on almost all of my personal stances and we had a lot of fun and raised some hell, but eventually it was his hardness and my softness that clashed and drove us apart. :s 

Edit: Naturally, message me or comment, or hit me up on Facebook...or you know, don't, or whatever. 8) Haha, what you'll notice right off the bat is I act, and talk really differently every little bit depending on my mood, but I've been known to be quite the writer/communicator. I don't know, yeah I also like researching and learning about any new interesting things for fun. Talking about favorite pieces of art, and understanding the way I do. :s "

* Grew up playing tons of computer games (back when PC Gamer was a respectable print publication rather than an ad-ridden pamphlet). But after having saved the world dozens of times, I'm enjoying my well-earned retirement.

I dropped out during the last year of high school. We use a different school system where I live, but it never works out. It all just piles up in the end and I never make it past a couple of months. I believe I got some issues with concentration and learning. I’ve nearly always finished with bad grades. 

Last fall, but that doesn’t really bring me down much. It’s likely to come back again, but not for a decade or three.

What this comes down to is my will to get a proper job and my own apartment. I live at home and work from home with low responsibility, pay my bills and save a bit, but it’s not nearly enough to make it moving out… I go to the employment agency, but we have a big lack of jobs in my country, especially with my credentials.

My social life is suffering much. I’ve lost quite a lot of friends lately due to bad social dynamics. I strongly believe I got Asperger’s syndrome and that probably plays a big part in it. I often correct people when they say things that aren’t correct, but apparently it’s only that circle of 3-4 (ex-) friends that seems to think that. I asked the few remaining friends I have, they don’t really seem to agree. However I’m aware of these two things and it feels like I’ve improved them lately.

I really want to get new friends and move on. It feels like my last circle of friends has an everlasting impression of me. Even if I stop correcting and interrupting (which it feels like I have in the past 6 months)

All of these things bring me down and I've talked to a few psychologists. The last one more or less gave up on me after 6-7 times and said she can't help further

Ever since I was 10 years old I've wanted to play lacrosse. But I live in south Florida so the sport isn't well known, eating healthier (haven't touched a soda/pizza/hamburger in years), etc. And this held up for years.


But I never once thought of the monetary cost of the game. And my parents wouldn't pay for it. I needed money but wasn't old enough to work. But I continued my conditioning, and endured endless hours of underpaying work, all to pay for my dream of someday getting to play lacrosse. 


Fast forward to today. I'm a senior, but we could still come out to practices if we so choose. 

But that doesn't help the fact that after all these years of dedication and hard work, etc etc"" but that means absolutely nothing to me if I can't play.

I have always been quiet and shy. It affected my school work when I was young and how many friend I had.

When school came to an end, things just ground to a halt... I was so far off the radar of teachers and everyone else by this point I never heard a single piece of advice on ANYTHING to do after this point.

The few people I did know obviously moved on with their lives

I had 2 relationships over the years

Since the ending of the last relationship I have had several quite unpleasant health problems... not brought on by anything other than failure to see or call a doctor within good time to nail it on the head and stop it getting worse and I'm now basically stuck with certain things for life because of that. Its just another knock to my none  existent confidence

In these 8 years I have had 2 very short jobs(totalling less than 2 years combined)

I keep myself to myself, I don't go out anywhere because there's no one to do anything with or even things to do... I just want to be left alone most of the time.

I can see every problem wrong with my life and I know the way to fix it is to simply 'strap on a pair' but I wouldn't even know where to start and I just can't ever do anything about it... even the people that are supposed to help me like advisor's at the Job Centre mock me for my  extremely care free attitude to everything. 
One even went so far as to advise me to never get stoned in case my brain can't be bothered to keep me breathing... for that matter several of these 'official types' even do accuse me of being stoned because of my lackadaisical attitude.

My life has been easy that's for sure, truly want things to be different then fail to act... I'm so scared of everything.

I'm bipolar

I like reading, helping people, learning new things, making friends; I game a little bit (I discovered Skyrim a few days ago... Aside from that, I love games like Final Fantasy and Kingdom Hearts).

I'm going into my second year of university. I change my majors alot, or both. My dream is to be a professor but I will settle for a job in the field of my studies, and my plan B is to go into secondary education.

I'm a friendly person, so if you feel inclined to converse with me send a message my way!

What I'm trying to say is I guess i'm looking for maybe some new online friends that I can hang out with, I just need a friend I can vent, hang out and talk to face to face, even though I have been through all this I still like to be optimistic, even though I can be cynical at times. 

I guess this is where I list a bit about me so...

- I'm a big movie buff and I love the art of film

- I'm a Pokemon nut and I just recently got back into it

- I love the shit out of Doctor Who (though i'm still in the 10th series)

- Music is a big part of my life and I usually always am listening to something, Queen, Daft Punk, Wavves, Biggie Smalls, Lupe Fiasco, Madeon, and etc

- Personality wise i'm pretty open minded, I love to listen to others so I would no mind if anyone vented to me

- I like to talk about really serious things as well such as Religion or Politics (I'm Agnostic and Independent BTW)

- Other hobbies of mine are reading, swimming

- I also love watching Basketball (Big Miami Heat Fan)

I'm not really good at this but I'm going to try .I'm just a normal 18 year old guy from Germany who is still going to school and I'm looking for a friend but not just a friend someone I can talk about everything with , weird  a little bit shy and introverted person who has no friends there was a time where I had many friends I was really outgoing and confident but that was a long time ago when I really got addicted to gaming and when my friends asked me out I neglected them every time just because I wanted to play a little more. I know it's my fault so I kind of understand why they left me since then I was always alone never had friends like that again.

 I think I already wrote to much about my past i should write more about my interest : gaming I still like playing games but not that much addicted to it like in the past , animes , tv shows like ""The Walking Dead"" , ""Breaking Bad"" and just recently I got into ""Doctor Who"" I really fell in love with it , my all time favorite is ""Prison Break"" I watched it like 4 times already , and I really like America I would really love to travel there it's like a dream of mine. I have many more  but I don't really want this to be so long and I can talk about anything you want :) so don't be scared if your not interested in something from the above actually I would prefer someone different than me but it would be nice too to meet someone similar :) 

Just send me a pm and please only if you're truly interested it kind of happened here that some people didn't seem that interested at all where I just got answers that were 2-3 words long and I know it's kind of weird in the beginning but for me I can write really much when i get comfortable and if you want to write somewhere else I have Kik , Skype too :) 

I hope I didn't do any mistakes since English isn't really my first language and that's my first time writing here and if you managed reading this far thanks for reading all of that :)

So, but I've never had problems with it, and I don't think I do now either, cause I have a tendency to just brush things off and go along with it. I never have problem with talking to people in school, but then that's that, I've gone to this school for the past 3 years, and have barely been with them in my spare time, where I'll meet a bunch of new people, even though I've been invited several times

But all of this of me having no actual friends to go to, I'd just play with them and never really think about it too much. I didn't have to consider how I looked or how I was acting, cause they continued to play with me as they enjoyed my company. But now I'm having problems connecting to them aswell, so I'm just feeling I have no where to go. There's a lot more to all of this that I'm not too sure how to write down currently, which also makes me pretty sad to think about, which never ever happens to me, which I guess also scares me a bit...

Personal:

Everyday I long for sleep yet I know when I sleep I will just have nightmares, since I was 10 years of age I've had 24/7 headaches. The pain is normally a constant 8 out 10. Never going below a 8, but always shooting up to a 10. It makes me mentally and physically exhausted. Makes me non sociable, I just feel so irritable, frustrated, angry, lost, dead inside, it's a struggle but mostly with myself and not the school work.

I've been trying to get help since I started to share my problems with my family at 17, acupuncture, herbalist, and massages. I now refuse pills all together. Pills don't help, but from my understanding they just mask the pain and not fix it. I try the natural ways. But currently I do nothing really for the pain, but I happen to smoke Cannabis. It takes a lot of the pain and stress off, makes me happy and less depressed. I get soo depressed. But I understand that Cannabis just makes me even less sociable, it help me self reflect and evaluate my life more.
I've spent so much time trying to figure out how to treat my pain

I feel that maybe the reason I'm not sociable, or friends. I've had 2 best friends, one now. But even then I just feel so detached and not a very close relationship to them. There was a lot of stuff that happened in my childhood that I just shrugged off and made decisions to cope with it as a child, and the adult me still follows those decisions that a child (me) made. Yet I was merely a child, I did not have the experience or knowledge how to deal with or cope with the problems I solved on my own, or thought I solved. The only person I ever talked to was myself. I never felt like I had a relationship with my parents growing up, the only person I was close to was my older sister, but usually we ended up getting rid of them or a few died. So I stopped wanting pets because it just killed me even more inside having to lose them.

I want to solve why I feel so abandoned, stop living in the past. Or just turn it into one of his silly stupid jokes. Then if I ever try to talk to my mom, she just becomes so defensive and think she is the victim for everything. I can't say anything that I seen in the past or felt about her in the past without her flipping her shit and denying any of that to ever happen... My sister... I do not know how to go about it. She just feels like a stranger to me most of the time.

1361211975.0,18rhr8,My thoughts,dragoone1111,6,2,4,"Hi reddit
I often think about my upbringing, and my Mother and I lived alone for a few years before we moved to North Carolina so we could live with my new stepdad that was in the Air Force. He always seemed nice to me, he tried to bring me back interesting animals every night; frogs, centipedes, praying mantises, snakes, things a little kid thought would be cool. It was nice having him around because I couldn't even remember my father, but I cherished them greatly. In the Carolinas my first half brother was born
I started elementary in a small school, short haired man that looked just like a big version of me. I was so excited to have that void filled, he had a great sense of humor, and he always tried to make time for me. Eventually he decided that my mom didn't deserve custody and he ran away with me, we were found two months later and he went to jail for two years. My mom pushed so hard for him to go to jail, and I hated her for it, she was ripping open the void again.
Eventually my mom met a new man, and he got me every other weekend. I remember waiting at the window at six o clock Friday nights, just waiting for his headlights to peak over the horizon. I also remember more than a handful of teary nights of him calling and telling me that the weather was too bad, or he was just feeling sick, and how it tore me up inside. But I didn't show it, big boys didn't cry, my dad never did
School was always shit, so I never let anyone close enough to do it. I grew up a shut in, antisocial weirdo. People thought of me as that one kid that didn't do anything. My grades were average in K-5, but 6-12 I had a spark of intelligence, I could keep my grades high, and I was finally proud of myself. I went on my first date at age 15 with a girl a grade below me. She was nervous, I was terrified. We were both outcasts brought together by one of my cousins, where I was basically having a mini seizure because of how bad I was shaking.
High school was repetitive, but hanging out with someone felt good. At sixteen, I saw my girlfriends tits and vag, but we never had sex because she was too scared, even though I told people we did if they asked me. She wouldn't give bj's or hand jobs because she thought it was trashy, and I tried to ask her why she thought that. Then I found out she was sexually abused by the fourteen year old boy that loved next door when she was seven or eight. I never brought up sexual questions after that. We went on dates and made out in public a lot because we didn't have anywhere we could be by ourselves. Before we met she was very depressed, and I tried to fix her and make her happy. She seems to have gotten better, unimportant things, I'm graduating and she has one more year
I always thought college would be the best path for me, I like playing instruments and I always wanted to be an entertainer, odd for someone who was such a social outcast when I think about it. Even getting my first guitar shocked everyone, I just ordered one online on a whim. I've already been accepted to a college in wisconsin for game art and animation, but I feel it's more of the one thing I know that I will be successful at if I go to school for it. I don't really think that it will make me happy. Now I've been thinking about just getting in my car with my SSN and birth certificate and starting over somewhere new.
I started working at a McDonalds last November, I eventually got closer to her. She's dating a marine recruit out in basic, but she doesn't know if she wants to be with him, he proposed to her as soon as she graduated, last year, and she said no. We often talk about our lives and when I'm with her I feel comfortable, but she has a built in defense to be an asshole when there are other people around so they don't want to be around her and so they can't hurt her. She did help me with my confidence some, I think she just wants someone to listen to her for once so she can stop being the punching bag.

I suppose I should mention; I desire email/instant messaging friends

Have a good weekend!

It's my assumption that most girls who post here get the most interest (go figure) from everyone and most guys here get little to none. That being said I'm taking my chances of this post actually drawing any attention very low.

But the truth is I am looking for someone to talk to on a Semi regular basis. I guess preferably a guy that way my girlfriend won't get jealous and pull the whole ""your talking to other girls on the Internet. Omg you'd don't love me"" card and go crazy.. Insecurities a bitch am I right?. It's happened before in the past. I just get along better with girlsI guess. never really has too many guy friends growing up .

Anyways now that we got that out if the way. Now seems to be the part where I talk a little bit about myself. ill keep it kind of short and sweet since this post is getting to be a little bit long. 

I'm 24 male living in San Diego California

I guess you would be able to say that working on music is my passion. I don't really see it like that anymore. I've become more jaded and critical of music so much I can't seem to enjoy it anymore. I could rant about this subject and go on and on but ill save it for later.

I grew up kinda sheltered by living with my grand parents. I lived in one of those senior apartments because my grandmother managed them. So that ment friends weren't really allowed to come over. So because of that I never really developed proper social skills through out school. I was the shy kid

i like movies
i'm into retro video gaming. i used to like playing guitar / music.

i use the word hate a lot instead of 'don't like'.
i hate people who are fake
i hate most everything on tv. i feel it is programming people to get dumber.
i hate how gas is 4 something in my area.

i love the beach
i hate people who are into 'whats cool' or 'trendy' just to be accepted.
sheeple. i hate sheeple

I live in a tiny town in the southern United States where I'm homeschooled, guitar and clarinet (but I'm not really a master at any of them), and I'm almost always listening to some form of music. I predominantly listen to metal of some sort, but I like just about everything to some extent, from classic rock to twee bubblegum pop music. I'd love to have someone to chat with about music of any kind - even if you don't like metal, I love being introduced to new things to listen to!

Aside from that, jogging, going swimming, playing video games of various sorts, and watching whatever show finds its way to the television station I'm currently surfing. Personality-wise, I'm open and trusting and I like helping others; and while I'm not exactly depressed I have my moments of gloominess, but I try to glow as best as I can whenever I'm not stuck in those moments.

I think most people would say I've had it good in general. I consistently do well in school

My parents (both refugees from war-torn countries), but it happened. When I was around 8 they divorced and my father moved to another country to be with another woman. He left us in a major debt, which devastated my mother. He still kept contact with me and my sister and frequently flew us over. However, it was just unbearable to see my mother crying everyday, working a minimum wage, going to school in the evening and not even getting a job out of it (to this very day she's a cleaner who works full-time for minimum wage). For that reason, my feelings for my father have always been ambiguous; he treats me well but he treats my mother like crap..

After a year or so my father broke up with this woman and came back to the country we resided in, but their relationship was extremely weird. A divorced couple, who would sometimes behave like a married couple (for the sake of the children) and sometimes would physically fight. Instead of helping us, they ruined a big part of my and my sister's childhood. So there were a lot of periods (which could last for months) in which my father didn't speak to my mother, and we would always have no cash. So from very young, I was tasked to go to my father and ask him for money, which I hated. I understood my mom, I was blamed. Because my father loved me the most

This has caused my relationship with my mother to be strained, but this time it lasts for almost a year. He gets another girlfriend, I forgot to tell this to my mother, and as my mother was on her way to visit her dying mother abroad, she sees them together, and she is taken by surprise and it killed her inside. Naturally, she was also very mad at me; and I hated myself

When she came back all hell broke loose and after years of problems at home, it has 1 room + a kitchen and a bathroom). My father never really gets mad at me or bother me, but I'm breaking my mother's heart. She called me yesterday begging me to come back but I don't know what to do... on the one hand we have a home where I'm constantly having arguments and such but with my mother whom I love a lot, on the other hand we have a (shitty) home but where I can focus my energy on positive things, but I live with a father whom I see as a dirty old man and a traitor. My mother's phone call has been on my mind since yesterday and I haven't slept. Also, I can't talk about this to anyone because I don't trust anyone to keep it a secret.

A lot of our friends we grew up with also moved away and/or we just fell out of touch/lost interest. I'm basically in a position where I feel like

Any friends I've ever made, something I was forced to do. I've got enough social anxiety that prevents me from putting myself out there and going somewhere by myself to meet new people. It's not crippling in that I can't go out at all ever, but the idea of doing something as simple as going to a local comic store to play some Magic with new people for the first time is incredibly daunting and paralyzing. It's something I struggle with, and am actively working on.

Growing up, and thinking back its something I miss dearly. I have fond memories of many late nights staying up with them, having hours upon hours of discussion about video games, movies, problems in our lives, etc. I'd love to meet some new people and try to find that again.

In my day job I work as a Web Application Developer. I'm a geek, movies, any kind of entertainment medium. I used to read a lot, but not as much as I used to. I burned myself out with a lot of fiction (and trying to write some), and so I've been reading non-fiction when I can. 

This year, everything just clicked and I completed my first game in years last month. I'm obsessed and addicted to creating/designing, and I don't see myself ever stopping. I'm a bit of a workaholic in that regard. Games are in a very special point right now in their evolution, and its exciting to see all the creative stuff happening, especially in the indie community, to push the medium forward.

Hmm, Mad Men, Arrested Development, Home Movies, and whatever classic shows were on Nick at Nite in the 90s. I'm kind of adverse to voice chat in general,  especially unless I know you IRL or we've known each other for a while. For IM I mainly use Steam and Pidgin. I'm potentially up for RL as well if you're in the Pittsburgh area.

I live in the middle of the Caribbean Sea in a tiny island called Dominican Republic. I don't care about your race, cultural upbringing,etc. I have learned to accept and love everyone as they are. I don't want to change you, I want to love you. No matter how strange/unusual others may find what you think/feel, I don't judge nor see the point on doing that.

I am at the same time a scientist/philosopher/artist/writer/healer/spiritualist/counselor. My #1 priority in life is to understand and figure out more about this reality we belong to. To tackle the hard question of life and find our purpose here. For me fame,etc are not appealing at all. What I care about is about love in all is manifestations, truth and wisdom.

I enjoy learning and reading a lot. I read about everything under the sun because of my curious nature. I also like good stories, anime, tv-series, books, myths...it is well written I want to know about it.

Teenie Background: Born and raised CA Bay Area. I'm a sickly little thing (all of 4'9'') so I rarely get out as much as I use to. Also my health has gone down in recent years which only adds to it. I'm really shy and lacking in the confidence department so I only had handfuls of friends. Most of my friends have disconnected from me and recently my boyfriend too and now I feel lonely. 

Strangely my little brother recommended I try Reddit so I figure why not?

**Interests:**

 Illustration/drawing/art (My major is Illustration

 Manga/Comics (too many to list but Adam Hughes is my favorite artist)

TV (Community is my favorite but I enjoy tons of shows)

 British TV (emerging Whovian, That Mitchell and Webb look, Sherlock and Q.I)

Anime/Animation (So many series

 Music

 Books (Neil Gaiman,classics),

 Traveling (I went to Australia for at least one month for the past 3 years

Video games(PS3 &amp;PC)

Lolita fashion

Cosplay

 Writing

 Victorian era (LOVE IT and collect a lot of books on it)

 Jack the Ripper

Criminology

 Forensics

 Swimming

Learning new things (I really want to learn to sew amongst other things)

Demonology

Myths

Paranormal (Ghost/Hauntings and such like)

 Cooking/Foodie (Butter chicken, rose macaroons, gelato, yorkshire pudding, Boba..trust me I'm so open to trying things but not good when it comes to heat),

Animals 

Cute things (San-X

...it goes on and on

While I'm mainly looking for people to chat with on Gtalk/mIRC/STEAM/Minecraft I don't mind planning a hang out but it varies with how my health is so for now just on the computer.

If there's anything else you want to know about me just ask here or PM

Big movie fanatic, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, The Great Escape, and too many others to list.

Also into plenty of TV shows. Big Doctor Who geek, Mr Bean, and so on. Also into shows like CSI, House, and plenty of others.
