1368447038.0,1e8ncw,Explaining the Falcao move to Monaco,nikcub,5334,2530,537,"**Edit** This post is now [a proper blog post

You have probably all already seen that Falcao is destined for Monaco. There were a lot of rumors about a  potential move to Manchester United

The answer is because of the complicated third-party ownership involved with Falcao. There was a very similar situation with Hulk when he moved to Zenit.

To explain this

But third party ownership is still alive and well on the continent. It is most often applied with South American stars making the jump across the Atlantic to Europe. The way it works is that investment groups will purchase the registration rights of an upcoming player. This is sometimes done while the player is at a club

For eg. one scenario would be that a 16 year old star in South America would be approached by an agent and asked if he wants backing with marketing and making it big in Europe. These deals usually involve paying the player a better salary, sponsorship deals etc. If and when the player agrees, the third party owners will then go to the club he is registered to and negotiate to buy his registration rights - either all of or part of.

The player is then in the hands of the management and third party ownership group, etc.

The other way third-party ownership happens is that the investment group finances a transfer for a player. For eg. Porto want to sign a player from Brasil but don't have the funds

The investment group make all of this upfront investment with the hope that at some point in the future the player proves himself

Some examples: Tevez and Mascherano were placed into West Ham by their investment group as a way of getting them more exposure. It worked out well in both cases as Liverpool purchased Mascherano (buying out the investment group and giving them a good return) and City eventually ended up buying out Tevez - albeit via Manchester United (who never owned the entirety of his transfer rights).

Back to Falcao. He was purchased by a third-party ownership group as part of his transfer to Porto. They bought 55% (likely more) of his transfer rights

Porto's financials show the following for the Falcao transfer:

&gt; sale of 60% of the economic rights of the player Bolatti to the entity Natland Financieringsmaatschappij B.V., approximately, 1,500,000 Euro, (transaction perform under the acquisition process of 40% of the registration of Falcao)

There is another section where it is disclosed that they sold another 5% option in Falcao

The same filing shows that Porto only owned 45% of Hulk.

What is more interesting is who is involved in the Falcao ownership. The group is called Doyen Sports and it was founded by Jorge Mendes (most famous as Ronaldo's agent

On their website [they have a page for Falcao](http://www.doyensports.com/en/RF.html) and you can also see the other players listed. Falcao, had floated Atleti some money to keep them alive (they got some shirt sponsorship in return) and had made the initial investment when he first transferred.

Falcao ends up moving to Atletico in a 40M move - despite Atleti the previous season stating that they had to clear players out because of their 220M euro tax bill with the Spanish government. What this ended up being is a 20 + 20M deal. 20M never gets paid because its just the third-party owners paying themselves, they only paid 2.5M and defaulted to the point of Porto threatening to sue and taking the issue up with FIFA). End situation is that around 60% of the rights are with the Doylen group. It also appears that while Falcao was at Atletico that Doylen took an option for a larger stake in him since Atleti were late on their payments. Something weird happen which involved Doylen taking a sponsorship. Either way, they had the majority stake and Atletico had no say or control of the player. For all purposes it was nothing more than a loan with Atletico having a small stake in his registration rights.

The president of Atletico Madrid continuously insisted that they own all the rights to Falcao

Falcao is on a wage of 10M euro per year, but that expired. The owners needed their return and they were going to get it one way or the other.

The list can be narrowed down to PSG, Chelsea and City. City aren't making large investments any longer, PSG have their fix of strikers. Of the remaining three, it is apparent that Real Madrid didn't want to pay up the 60M + 50M in contracts for Falcao (for whatever reason). Apparently Chelsea matched the 60M clause but to pay Falcao the 10M per season in wages would involve a total gross salary of 300k+ per week, which just isn't manageable. 

Chelsea also have the issue of not being allowed to directly purchase a player from a third-party owner (apparently this is what turned ManU off a move) so it would have required a two-step sale with Falcao going to one club outright and then to Chelsea. Apparently with the David Luiz transfer on the same day he moved to Chelsea Benfica bought out the entirety of his rights from third-party owners (so you can summize that Chelsea gave them the money to buy out that deal so that they could purchase 100% of Luiz directly from Benfica

With all of these factors you end up with only one target: Monaco. They have the 60M to pay out the investors

So in the end Falcao is moved around Europe by his investors with the only goal of making a return for them. He has little to no say in his final destination because of a deal he agreed to years ago while he was still in South America.

Last year I made a fake picture of an Atletico Madrid kit for shits and giggles. Spanish press circulated it as the real deal. AM fans were outraged with it. I only found out now that a company that makes dodgy knock-off kits thought it was real too


**NTL;R version**

Right
First off, etc. Another thing I like to do sometimes is knock out designs for football shirts. I’ve an interest in football shirts in general so it’s something I do mostly out of boredom or to try out different photoshop methods, such as drawing paths, etc. I post some of these designs on [www.footballshirtculture.com](www.footballshirtculture.com), which has a gallery section for user created kit designs.

At the start of January last year

I [recreated the shirt in Photoshop](http://i.imgur.com/btDfg.jpg), I knocked out what an [Atletico Madrid shirt might look like using the same style](http://i.imgur.com/wNEvd.jpg). Even though I wasn't fond of it myself, I saved it and uploaded to the gallery and thought nothing more of it.

The next day I look at the site and I notice that my Atletico shirt design was getting a huge number of hits (1000 in a couple of days, and I found [this article](http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/nueva-camiseta-11-12-tendra-rayas/20110102dasdaiftb_39/Tes).

Here’s a Google translation:
&gt;The design of the new shirt of Atletico Madrid for the 2011-12 season saw the light in the Dutch website dedicated to footballshirtculture.com. This shirt would end up with stripes on the sleeves and incorporate a total of seven red stripes on eight other white, disappear for the 2011-12 and thus give a more in polo shirts and less.
&gt;The new red and white uniform is always one of the best kept secrets as a sports brand that sponsors the club always likes to keep the mystery about how it will be the shirt. Therefore
&gt;In addition to the shirt of Atletico, but Blaugrana, the Arsenal, Manchester United or Ajax.

Another quick search then brought up [this thread](http://www.colchonero.com/camisetas_2011_2012_filtracion-itemap-1-94789-1.htm) on www.colchonero.com, feedback was pretty divisive.

Twenty-seven pages. Twenty-seven pages of Atletico Madrid fans in uproar over the shirt. My shirt. The shirt that I casually shat out in a couple of bored minutes. I didn’t even *like* it.

This was all a year ago. However, but so did a company in Asia that make knock-off replica shirts. To get their dodgy merchandise out at the same time as the official kit launch, they sometimes have to go ahead with manufacturing before the design is confirmed...

I think you know now where this is going.

So without further ado

I can't stop laughing.

EDIT 1: Thanks everyone for the positive feedback. Even if I wanted to proceed to take some sort of legal action, so I don't need to say if you were inclined to buy one, make sure your credit details are secure (from what I can tell, it's a legit site).

The community at /r/soccer now has more than 100, and it's big enough to make it worth noting.

As moderators of this group, diverse, intelligent, and all around best place in the world for news and discussion about the game of Association Football in all its locations and forms.

Our community shows that it doesn't matter if you grew up calling the sport soccer, futebol, fútbol or calcio. The beautiful game brings people together, and when people come together for a common purpose, wonderful things can happen. Everyone who has helped this community become what it is deserves a big round of applause.

We also think it is entirely within the spirit of our group that we mark this milestone in a very concrete and positive way.

Because of that we are pleased to announce the launch of the **/r/soccer Let's Go Play** fundraising campaign on behalf of [One World Futbol Project’s](http://www.oneworldfutbol.com/) partner organizations around the world.

The One World Futbol is a virtually-indestructible ball designed to be used anywhere that a ball can conceivably be kicked. The ball has no air bladder, and will go on playing even when punctured. 

Sport has the power to bring communities together and create networks of dedicated people. A network of committed individuals is among the greatest resources possible when it comes to local development. 

A ball that keeps on being a ball is incredibly helpful in building teams that can tackle issues far more serious than how to win a game. A standard ball often fails within weeks in Nairobi or Kabul. This ball is designed to last for decades

Please see [Campaigns](http://www.oneworldfutbol.com/category/campaign/) at One World Futbol Project for more information about organizations using the ball
for more background information.


**Here is how you can support the /r/soccer Let's Go Play initiative and  bring the power of play to
youth around the world:**

* **Visit the [/r/soccer Let's Go Play campaign](http://www.oneworldfutbol.com/campaigns/lets-go-play/)** hosted on One World Futbol Project’s
website. Through the campaign

* *Buy One Give One*. Buy a ball for yourself and another ball will be donated
in the name of the “r/soccer Let’s Go Play” campaign.

* *Just Give*. Donate a ball (or many) directly to the campaign
Futbol Project will make sure they get to children and youth served by their
partner organizations.

[pictorial evidence](http://i.imgur.com/cMspY.jpg)

I know U17 women's world cup isn't really popular here. I watched a few games on ESPN3 a few days ago then went to the FIFA website to look up stats.  Something seemed off with the Nigerian team (I am Nigerian, plus the logistics of travelling regularly in a developing country with poor roads makes it highly unlikely that parents allow minors to skip skill and travel around the country to play football.  

I got a little hint about the captain on the team and followed the electronic trails (thank you facebook).  The captain of the Nigerian U17 team has a younger sister that is 19 years old, especially in African countries.  FIFA started using MRI to look at bone development to determine eligibility, the same measure is not used for women.  

I've tried contacting sports journalists in Nigeria to get some information about the Nigerian women's league and the players but it appears that most Nigerians will rather look the other way.  

How can I bring more attention to this?  How can i get bloggers and journalists from countries participating in the tourney to look at my somewhat persuasive evidence?

[Story got picked up

**EDIT 2**
Canada just lost to North Korea another team that most likely guilty of using old players in junior competition. N.Korea have been in the finals of the U17 world cup the two times it has been held

A writer for one of the major Nigerian newspaper contacted me and he'll be writing about this in the Saturday edition of the paper.  

More people familiar with Nigerian players came forward to tell me that they know players that are indeed too old to be in this tournament but most of them have one excuse or another to justify the cheating.

Many of the players remaining in Azerbaijan have seen the story. I have received msgs from frustrated players hoping something will be done to stop or reduce age cheating in the women's game for future players.

1366900705.0,1d31z8,So it's happening again: the Man United crest I designed a year back is being reported as the new crest.,coolinwithcosta,1875,508,237,"You'd have thought the media would've learned after [the last time](http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/owbs8/how_i_accidentally_trolled_the_spanish_press/).

**TL;DR version**

[This Manchester United crest](http://i.imgur.com/oB3ZFaV.jpg) I designed for a competition about a year ago is doing the rounds on football websites who are reporting it to be a leak of a potential new official crest.


**NTL;R version**

About a year ago, but that was the last I'd thought of it.

Fast forward to today, such as [101greatgoals](http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/leaked-an-image-of-manchester-uniteds-new-201314-crest/), [MSNsport](http://sport.uk.msn.com/trending-blog/have-manchester-united-redesigned-their-crest), [Metro.co.uk](http://metro.co.uk/2013/04/25/leaked-manchester-united-set-to-introduce-brand-new-badge-3666342/), and [EPLtalk](http://epltalk.com/2013/04/25/are-manchester-united-planning-on-unveiling-a-new-club-crest-photo/).

So just to sum up the basic truths:

1) Yes

2) Accidentally fooling the sports press is even easier than I thought.",,t5_2qi58,1366901038.0,,arsenal,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1d31z8/so_its_happening_again_the_man_united_crest_i/

1374338663.0,1ip9cr,Football/Soccer fans - please take a few minutes to learn of the demise of Coventry City FC. Thank you.,covmatty1,1845,482,299,"As some of you may know, are in turmoil.

Attempting to sum up everything that has happened to us over recent times is a near impossible task, I'm very sorry.

To begin

* We are owned by a hedge fund named **SISU**, who has never been seen by anyone. The Cheif Executive of our club is Tim Fisher, SISU's mouth to the public.

* We played at a ground called the Ricoh Arena, hotel, gym and executive facilities. Crucially, it is **not owned by the club**. Coventry Council and a charity (The Alan Higgs Trust) each own a half stake. They are collectively known as **ACL**, from whom the club rents the ground. Our average attendance was far less than half of the capacity.

Last season, no rent has been paid to ACL for over a year. True, the rent rate was ridiculously high (£1.4million/year), but that's the deal which was signed and SISU have refused to pay. 

It was determined by the League (correctly of course) that we were given a 10 point deduction

* An administrator was appointed to deal with the club. Despite the fact this should be impartial

* We were told by SISU that we had been thrown out of the Ricoh for unpaid rent

* The ground owners ACL stated that this **was a lie**. Their doors were still open. They then even offered for us to play there **completely free** for the upcoming season.

* It was announced 4 bids came in for the part of the club in administration. The winning bid, named **Otium Ltd**. So a company put itself into administration with huge debts, then buys itself back out again. That doesn't add up to me, but the Football League cleared it with no problem.

* It was announced that the club had agreed to play its home games at Northampton Town

* The plan (supposedly) was to play there for 3 years

* SISU now want to build a new ground somewhere in Coventry, nothing agreed, and **there is no proof that SISU ever intend to actually do anything they promise**.

* Liquidation is a very real possibility now. We almost expect it. And then our beloved CCFC will be no more.

To summarise, due to Northampton having their own games. Season tickets were only put on sale yesterday, and no kit has been announced. So for a whole summer, not a penny has come into our club from any fans.

Clearly, who represent the fans, have been rejected without consideration. Today, a march was held through the city, my pictures of which are here: http://imgur.com/a/EXn8a. 

The diversity in the people present today was amazing

It has been made clear to the club that the majority of fans **will not travel**. Our ""Diamond Club"", they may have seen their last ever Coventry game. Younger children will now not be able to see their heroes, and a whole generation of fans may well be lost. 

We had fans of AFC Wimbledon joining us today, the reception their attendance got when it was announced in the first speech of the march brought a lump to my throat. Statements were read out from other Supporter's Trusts, as varied as Liverpool to Birmingham City, supporting our cause. Thank you from the bottoms of our Sky Blue hearts to everyone who has done so. Rivalries were put aside, and the love of the game united fans from across the country.

I'm fairly sure I'll have missed some crucial information

Thank you to all who have read my post. We're all so disillusioned that we're not sure what we can do any more, and we want everyone to know the terrible things that can happen when sport becomes a business. Part of my life, my first love, and that of many others, is being disregarded. I hope such a thing never happens to any of your clubs, as we all know how much the game means to us. Fight the corporate culture of football and bring it back to those without whom it could not exist, us,,False,t3_1ip9cr

2011-2012 regular season games only:

EPL

 * 1066 goals
 * 380 matches
 * 2.81 goals per match

NFL

 * 1259 TDs
 * 256 games
 * 4.9 TDs per game

Now factor in real time per game viewing length:

 * NFL:  3 hours
 * EPL:  1 hr

So

 * NFL:  187/4.9 = 38.16. A touchdown every 38 minutes of real time.
 * EPL: 111/2.81 = 39.50.  A goal every 39 minutes of real time.

Basically the same rate.  This leaves out field goals

Footnotes:

1370889349.0,1g27ak,"Footballers who were over-hyped, blew it, or lost control: #1 Adriano",CalumArcadia,1350,590

**What was expected of him:** After making his first appearance for Brazil at just 18 years of age, hulking frame meant there were very few arguments. An exceptional header of the ball, and with a rocket of a left foot, Adriano was seemingly the complete package.

**What the world got:** His first six months with Inter bore little fruit, who would finish the season both relegated and bankrupt. However, with 6 goals in 15 games, Adriano did as much as anybody that year to try and save the team. At the tender age of 20, the Brazilian had begun to showcase his ability to the wider world. When the season ended, Parma paid Inter almost £7,000, as he quickly formed a world-class partnership with Romanian team-mate Adrian Mutu. His first season with Parma saw him score 17 goals in 31 appearances

Chelsea's billions saw Adrian Mutu leave the team in the summer of 2003, but Adriano found himself back at Inter in January 2004 after 9 goals in 13 games. The Nerazzurri had decided Adriano's development was sufficient, and they bought out Parma's ownership stake for £16,000,000. He was quickly put into the starting line-up, and handed the #10 shirt. Adriano flourished playing alongside the likes of Christian Vieri, Alvaro Recoba, helping himself to 12 goals in 18 games during the final five months of the season

It was around this time that Adriano really proved himself as an International quality footballer. 25 goals for Brazil in 35 games between 2003 and 2006 saw his stock rise considerably,000 for his services, before Mourinho opted to bring Hernan Crespo back from Italy to compete with Didier Drogba, then later signing Andriy Shevchenko.

Adriano was rewarded for his performances with a new contract in September 2005, something which he would later be criticized for after a poor showing at the 2006 FIFA World Cup, along with Ronaldinho. With his body starting to decline, and his powers waning, the 2005/06 season was the beginning of the end for Adriano. 18 goals in 47 games for Inter wasn't good enough by his own standards, and he would only score a further 12 goals for Inter over the next three seasons, albeit with six months of that spent on loan to Sao Paulo. Adriano was released by Internazionale in April 2009, and taking in a forgotten spell at A.S. Roma.

Now, and his club to UEFA Champions League trophies now serves as a cautionary tale to young footballers.

2': [](//#ball) **GOAL FRED BRAZIL 1-0** What a start! A cross from Hulk leads to a scramble in the box, manages to lift it over Casillas.  **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/ibvoTDL5sC5iBH.gif)**

6': Brazil are attacking quickly when they have the ball and pressing hard without. They look a very confident side.

7': Spain begin to settle into their passing rhythm

9': Oscar screws a decent chance wide from 15 yards.  Neither defense is looking solid

11': Paulinho attempts an audacious chip

13': Spain are frustrated by Brazil's pressure

15': [](//#yellow) Handbags! Brazil break and Neymar is tripped up by Arbeloa on the halfway line. Brazil demand a red card for denying a clear goal-scoring opportunity

19': Iniesta launches an absolute rocket from 35 yards

21': Spain settling into possession

25': Brazil are still looking more dangerous and attacking fluidly.  Dani Alves finds Fred

26': Two penalty shouts in quick succession: Spain launch another ball into the box

28': [](//#yellow) Oscar goes down VERY easily right outside of the box

32': Spain with a few corners that come to nothing, isn't he?

36': Spain continue to work triangles and flicks

41': **WHAT A PLAY DAVID LUIZ** The Spainiards break

43': Fred crosses into the box with Neymar unmarked

44': [](//#ball) **GOAL NEYMAR BRAZIL 2-0** Brilliant from Neymar, makes sure he's onside, and in a delayed one-two gets past Arbeloa to finish high and left of Casillas.  What a goal. **[GIF](http://i.minus.com/iyudOBAItYpmF.gif)**

---

[](//#whistle) **HALFTIME BRAZIL 2-0 SPAIN**
Spain may be edging possession, and wheeling away on the counter. A very intense and massively entertaining first half. Can Spain find an answer? Should Spain send Cesc or Villa on right away?  Silva, Navas, Cazorla, an injured Soldado... lots of options.

POSSESSION

41% Brazil - Spain 59%

**Second Half**

[](//#whistle) **KICKOFF** 

[](//#sub)As we all hoped

47': [](//#ball) **GOAL FRED BRAZIL 3-0** A wonderfully worked goal

58': Fred is away on his own

59': [](//#sub) Last roll of the dice for del Bosque

62': Fred has Neymar in the box

63': It's such a cliche

68': [](//#red) **RED CARD GERARD PIQUE** For the umpteenth time tonight

70' The Maracana, and Brazil may be looking for another goal or two.

72': [](//#sub) Jadson gets a runout as Hulk comes off.

77': The match has reached a snail's pace as exhaustion sets in.  Spain are standing around the pitch in possession.  Then Neymar breaks

79': [](//#sub) Fred won't get his hat-trick

80': Pedro with a good shot! Julio Cesar makes a great save

82': And Jo announces himself

86': Out of nowhere

88': [](//#sub) Hernanes comes on for Paulinho in the final change of the evening.

90': Brazil are finally happy to kick the ball about as the Maracana is about to explode.

**What was expected of him:** A strong,000 transfer to Arsenal in 1997, Nicolas Anelka was viewed as the best attacking prospect in European football at the time. An explosive two years with the Gunners saw Real Madrid spend £22,300,000 on the French striker, who was still just 20 years old. Part of a generation of superb, young, which included Patrick Vieira, Nicolas Anelka was projected to be the man who would lead the line

**What the world got:** Nobody would ever claim that Nicolas Anelka has had an unsuccessful career, a UEFA Champions League winner, and part of the French Euro 2000 winning side, Anelka certainly has the silverware of a champion. However, how much more could he have won, but for his attitude?

After making 12 appearances for Paris Saint-Germain between 1996 and 1997, Anelka seized his opportunity after an injury to Ian Wright, and established himself in the Arsenal first-team. 9 goals from 40 games in his first full season at the club, and winning the Double, gave some hint towards the player that was to come. The following year, the Frenchman scored 19 goals in 46 games, at just 19 years of age.

This was more than enough to convince Real Madrid that Nicolas Anelka was the real deal. With Anelka wanting a better contract,300,000, giving Arsenal a profit of £21,800,000. This was to become one of the first great sales by Arsene Wenger, as he would continue to make a habit of generating profit for the club through his transfer dealings.

As Arsenal quickly replaced Anelka with Thierry Henry, manager John Toshack was replaced by Vicente del Bosque, and Anelka's personal problems began to show. After refusing to train, he was suspended for 45 days, before redeeming himself towards the end of the campaign with 2 goals in the UEFA Champions League semi-finals against Bayern Munich. Real went on to win the final, beating Valencia 3-0, with Anelka playing 80 minutes

Anelka's performances were, and he started their first two group games. Substitute appearances in the third group game and quarter-final were followed by a start in the semi-final, as France beat Portugal 2-1 after extra-time. After failing to score in any of his previous 5 games in the tournament, Anelka was benched for the final in favour of Thierry Henry and Christophe Dugarry. France would win the final via a David Trezeguet Golden-Goal, and Anelka had another major honour to add to his rapidly growing collection.

Following the tournament,000 for their former player, and Madrid snapped their fingers off. A return to France helped bring out some of the old Anelka, as he scored 13 in 37 in his first season back in France, playing alongside Jay-Jay Okocha and Laurent Robert. The following season, with Ronaldinho in the team, Anelka managed just 5 goals from 20 appearances before being loaned to Liverpool in January 2002.

His time in Liverpool wasn't filled with goals, and his effort was much appreciated by the Anfield crowd. Anelka helped Liverpool to, at that time, their highest ever standing in the Premier League, as they finished runners-up to Anelka's former team, Arsenal. At the end of the season though, Gerard Houllier decided not to sign Anelka on a permanent deal, Liverpool dropped to 5th

Once it became clear Liverpool wouldn't be signing him,000. Kevin Keegan's team had just won promotion to the Premier League, and planned to build their attack around the Frenchman. Anelka's time with City is perhaps seen as him at his best, and in his first season with the club he scored 14 league goals to help them finish 9th in the league. The following season, they finished 16th, despite his 24 goals in 43 games. By the time January 2005 had rolled around, Manchester City decided to sell up, and after originally deciding that he wanted a move to the United Arab Emirates, and 45 goals for Manchester City.

Anelka spent only 18 months in Turkey, when Sam Allardyce splashed out a club record £8,000,000 on the striker. Anelka quickly got back into the swing of English football, and Bolton were rewarded with 12 goals from 39 games in his debut season with the Wanderers. The following season, he'd scored 11 in 22 before Chelsea came calling during the January transfer window, paying £15,000 for him. Anelka's first season at Chelsea was filled with near-misses, Anelka was also part of the Chelsea team which narrowly missed out on both the Premier League

With the scores level at 1-1, the teams prepared for penalties, and after manager Avram Grant asked which players wanted to take a spot-kick, Anelka didn't raise his hand. In ordinary circumstances, this is fine, but with the teams level after 6 penalties each, Chelsea were fast running out of willing participants. After Ryan Giggs took, Manchester United's seventh from the spot

Despite a bad start to his Chelsea career, and finished as the Premier League's top scorer. He spent another two and a half years at the London club, helping them to a Premier League title and 2 FA Cups, but the majority of his playing time saw him out-wide in order to incorporate Didier Drogba. 

Anelka headed to the World Cup, France stumbled through the World Cup qualifiers, and controversially won the World Cup play-off against the Republic of Ireland. Anelka had scored the winner in the 1st leg, but it took a Thierry Henry handball to see France through the tie. Desperate for success, and hoping to go one better than the previous tournament, where they finished runner-up to the Italians, France couldn't afford any slip-ups. It wasn't to be, it emerged Anelka had reacted badly to the French manager's criticism of him at half-time, sparking a mutiny amongst the remaining French players. Once the tournament ended, as Anelka decided to retire from international football.

After 184 games and 59 goals for the Blues, and forced him to train with the youth team.

A salary of around £200, he left the club after an angry exchange with a fan, when he refused to bow to the Shanghai supporters. Amidst rumours that the Chinese club hadn't paid wages to their stars, Anelka moved to Juventus in January 2013, playing only 2 league games (and 41 minutes) during their Serie A winning season.

Nicolas Anelka's career took in 10 different clubs, with Thierry Henry, his replacement at Arsenal, becoming the country's leading scorer with 51 goals. David Trezeguet scored 34 goals, and Sylvain Wiltord bagged 26. He may have a bulging trophy cabinet, but it's important to remember how good Anelka was expected to become. He broke through around the same time as Michael Owen and Thierry Henry, yet was seen by many as the biggest prospect of them all after his performances with Arsenal.

His career total is 204 goals from 646 appearances at club level, are the best individual honours he managed, and he was nominated only once for the Ballon d'Or, gaining 0 votes. The majority of professionals would be ecstatic with these accolades, and there are some who will always claim Anelka was a great player. On his day, he certainly was, but he was expected to become so much more. His petulant attitude and maddening inconsistency cost him a truly glittering career.

Match Start:

10' Very lively start for both teams

15' Man U starting to pile on a bit of pressure in RM 30

18' Nani piles on pressure

19'  Evra picks up the first yellow of the match for a cynical foul 

**21' GOALPOST** hit by Man U from corner!!!!!!! Vidic hits the post

33' GOAL! NOT COUNTED! Ramos fouls on corner with his elbow!

34' Lopez 2 fantastic saves on counter attack from Man U!!!!!!!!!!!

36' Arbeloa studs up challenge yellow

42' Di Maria looks to have a hamstring injury

**Half Time:** Energetic first 40 minutes, Man U having better ones

SCORE NIL - NIL (1 - 1 aggregate

**48' GOAL MAN U!!**

**Own goal

1 - 0 ( 2 - 1 Man U agg)

**58' STRAIGHT RED CARD TO NANI!!! Debatable studs up challenge from him on Arbeloa. This makes things VERY interesting**

59' Modric for Arbeloa - Ferguson turns to stands and riles up the crowd. unseen scenes at old trafford!

**68' GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOAL!!!!!! MAdrid SUB MODRIC RIFLES IN A SHOT FROM 20 YARDS OUT OFF THE GOALPOST!!**

**69' GOAAAL!!!! Ozil and Higuain link up well before the latter flashes a shot/cross across the face of goal. Ronaldo slides in at the back post to divert it in and give Madrid the advantage. 
!!!!!! RM leads!**

1 - 2 ( 2 - 3  agg)

71 YELLOW CARD! Carrick enters the referee's notebook for dissent after claiming for a penalty against Khedira.

72' YELLOW CARD! Kaka follows Carrick into the book shortly afterwards for a foul on Evra.

72' ROONEY IS ON

80' Man U needs 2 goals and they are 1 man down. Looks like RM will advance under questionable circumstances from an earlier red card decision

80' Young for Welbeck

83' Lopez with a quick reaction on a header! SAVE!

84' ROONEY MISSED A VOLLEY! Right in front of goal!

86' Valencia on....how the mighty have fallen... one of best wingers of last season is on so late

1335874396.0,t1f1k,"Why European Soccer is the Most ""American"" of Sports",Botron,1312,395,832,"There's a subset of American society that vehemently hates soccer. To each his own

Not to make this political

“I don’t get the baseball thing, and they riot over it, and they continually try to jam it down our throat… It doesn’t matter how you sell it to us. It doesn’t matter how many celebrities you get. It doesn’t matter how many bars open early. It doesn’t matter how many beer commercials they run. We don’t want the World Cup. We don’t like the World Cup. We don’t like soccer. We want nothing to do with it. You can package it any way — you can spend all kinds of money. You can force it on our television sets. We will not enjoy the World Cup.” 

Let's start by ignoring the factual inaccuracy of the above given the [ratings](http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/29/sports/soccer/29sandomir.html) were exceptional as the USA round of 16 game vs Ghana exceeded those of the World Series despite time zone differentials, but reject soccer outright because it is somehow ""Foreign"" or ""European"" or ""Immigrant.""

The point I would make is these same people continually espouse free market capitalism and rail against the ""elites

*In American sports, and therefore presumably are rewarded with better new players. In European soccer, there is no draft and it is up to each club to develop / acquire its own talent.

*In American sports, max contracts, minimum contracts, trade exceptions, caps on cash used in trades, matching of player salaries in trades, etc. Not in Europe. You want a player? Buy him. Want to get rid of a player? Sell him. No need to work out a complex trade with another team

*The NFL is socialist! (gasp!) 32 teams that all share revenue.

*Relegation. In the US

**TL;DR** I find it interesting that those on the right that denigrate soccer fail to realize that its business model / regulatory framework much more closely matches their view of ""American Capitalism"" while the American sports they love more closely resemble their view of ""European Socialism.""",,t5_2qi58,False,,arsenal,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/t1f1k/why_european_soccer_is_the_most_american_of_sports/

I know that most of you are either from England or USA

That's really another thing. To choose were to go on stadium. There are so many aspects of watching game live on the stadium that i am sure we could help each other out. Even if you're going cause your team is playing in Kazachstan (looking at you Celtic fans) you might get some insight from Kazach that will help you out how to enjoy your time best for those few hours before game.

What do you think guys?

EDIT: So here it is: http://www.reddit.com/r/footballtourists/  

Please subscribe. And help. Cause without you guys there's no point of doing this. I will love to help anyone buying tickets in Poland and stuff. But this do not have a point without guys from whole world working on this. If there is anyone that would be interested in helping with moderation it would be awesome if you'd write to me about that.

1373911868.0,1icrfu,[GUIDE] Mexican League.,BrndyAlxndr,994,246,407,"The Mexican League (Known since 2012 as the **Liga MX**) is one of the most popular and followed leagues outside of Europe. The league is currently ranked number 11 in the world and number 10 in the last decade (2001–2010) by the IFFHS. Many players in recent years have left the Mexican League and have gone to play in Europe. In this self post I will attempt to address some of the aspects of the league that are usually confusing for foreigners and I will try to go over each team and do a little write up on each one.

The Apertura 2013 Tournament starts this Friday.

**Apertura and Clausura**

The Liga MX uses a short tournament format. What this means is that there are 2 champions every year

In the playoffs teams are seeded 1-8 and face each other over two legs (home and away). In case of a tie the team with the away goal advantage goes through


**Copa MX**

Not much to add here


**Relegation and Promotion** 

Relegation is way different from what they do in Europe. The Liga MX uses an average point system

Points Earned/Games Played.

This system was implemented to protect teams who have a bad season and to stop them from dissapearing due to the massive payout disparity  between the first and the second divisions.

Promotion is also a bit different. Teams in the second division also play two tournaments per year

**Transfers** 

The transfer window for players already in the Liga MX is open for only 2 days during a period known as *the draft.*

Players are not allowed to leave on a free

The transfer window for transactions involving foreign teams is open from July to September.

**The Teams**

- **Purchases**

Mourinho has brought some excellent players, Essien who came on loan and was critical in surviving 3 competitions and dozens of injuries and Luka Modric who, despite criticisms, has become an integral part to a Madrid team that thrives on midfielders just as much as it does on wingers. 

- **Youth Team**

Despite reports to the contrary, Morata, Álex, Jesé, Casado, Mateos, Jesús, Mejías, Rodriguez

Carvajal (Bayer Leverkusen), Sarabia (Getafe), Juan Carlos (Betis), Mendes (Sporting de Portugal) and Pablo Gil (Sparta de Praga).

Despite only having Adan, the effort is impacting when compared to recent predecessors at Madrid. 


- **Individual Player Tactics and Extracting Potential**


If there is one player who elevated themselves in large part to Mourinho it would have to be **Marcelo**. He went from a Mourinho snub to a Mourinho favorite quickly and became a regular Brazil and Madrid starter despite having Coentrao to compete with. 

**Essien** is a player who seemingly had his best days behind him and little to look forward to before coming to Madrid

**Coentrao** elevated his game out of necessity as Marcelo found himself plagued by injuries in recent times and has managed to become a balanced fullback who is able to exert himself physically in defense but also manages the occasional flash of grace as he pushes upward. 

Tactically

**Ramos** came to Madrid as a CB from Sevilla but was eventually shifted to the extremity, when successful, have been some of the world’s best in the back line. One could also argue that Mourinho’s clash with captain Iker Casillas has also brought out a more mature man out of Ramos as he has been forced to undertake the role of Captain in recent matches. He has shown more discipline in the area, when he crosses the line he has shown humility with his opponents (Ramos vs. Lewa) afterwards and has been a constant presence pushing the team onward as they have found themselves dozens of times behind the marker. 

- **Tactics in General**

Barcelona seemed unbeatable under Guardiola, Mourinho has evolved his scheme from full out defense to a more controlled and precise counter-attacking scheme that mixes both defense and physicality (http://youtu.be/LXfQO3TLfQ4). Physicality… if there is one word to describe this Madrid it would be that word (http://youtu.be/vO8ppE4uChc. 


- **Voicing the Need to Unify the Lower Division Squads Tactically**

He failed in this but he spoke out at the very least and was spot on. To survive year after year without having to rely on 11 foreigners Madrid needs to imitate their rivals and start applying tactics across the board (no Nacho at CB when the #1 asks for him at RB). Despite failing

- **Entertainment**

I hate the fact that with Mourinho, and the fans look more at the Portuguese manager than the team at times. But that is just me. Others find it amusing (http://youtu.be/nPmDpzYO2_U), entertaining, and a reason to open up the tabloids, reddit, and the matches. Take this as you will but, regardless

1370964941.0,1g4k1b,"Footballers who were over-hyped, blew it, or lost control: #2 Freddy Adu",CalumArcadia,878,382

**What was expected of him:** The first pick in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, Adu joined the IMG Academy in 2002 at the age of 12. The world went crazy over the American soccer player, and after being selected in the 2004 Draft by D.C. United, it seemed like the sky was the limit. A Nike sponsorship deal, and knowing nods from the likes of Pele, led many to believe Freddy Adu would finally be the American superstar who could break ""soccer"" in America.

**What the world got:** The Ghanaian born American, and was rather fortunate to move to the United States in the first place when, at the age of 8, his mother won the Green Card Lottery. Building up a reputation through various youth soccer tournaments, Adu was well on the way to becoming a household name. His performance against Juventus led Internazionale to apparently lodge a £500,000 offer with Adu's mother, who was his agent at the time. She decided, that Freddy's development would be best served in the United States

Adu was selected as the #1 pick by D.C. United in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft, respectively. Adu made his debut for D.C. in April 2004, at 14 years of age, and scored his first professional goal two weeks later. The buzz around him, however, quickly evaporated as several commentators noted his incredibly small stature and the ease at which older and larger opponents could shrug him off the ball. This was despite the fact that many had raised questions over Adu's true age, with constant speculation that his birth certificate had been faked before his move to the United States, his development was way behind that of his fellow professionals, but there appeared to be no end product, Adu was traded to Real Salt Lake in late 2006. 

Still only 16,250,000 in order to secure his services. They too quickly realised that Adu wasn't ready for first-team football, and decided to let him mature slowly, and to develop his talent over time. Things didn't work out that way for Adu, and after manager Fernando Santos left the club just 1 game into the season, it seemed Adu's days were numbered. After just 20 games in Portugal, with spells in France, and joined Philadelphia Union in the 2011 MLS Season. 2 goals in 13 games his first year was disappointing, and still just 24 years old

It goes on to report that Ibra and Monaco have agreed on wages and it is believed that a fee of €30-€35 million would be enough to get the towering striker.

I bought the newspaper this morning and thought I'd post it here. It's not on their website yet

This could be huge for Monaco. I think Zlatan could play as a 9 with Falcao coming from the left. What an attack that would be.

And Tahiti begin with the traditional 'swapping of the golden necklace' ritual.

0' Tahiti currently have enjoyed 100% possession

3' Tahiti have attacked twice in the opening minutes

[4' GOAL! Fernando Torres can now add 'dream-killer' to his impressive list of achievements as he slots it past Roche.](http://i.minus.com/iAe3Z1NEsNhRY.gif)

6' Spain try a cross in and Roche manages to land a hand on it to tap it out of the box weakly.

12' The excellently named Steevy Chong Hue is taken down in the box as Tahiti break

13' Mikael Roche proves his tenacity by trying one of the hardest goalkeeping moves: tying up your shoelaces without taking your gloves off.

15' Torres continues his quest to make every single person on the face of the earth hate him and his stupid shaved head by seeming to catch Roche's fingers on the way through as he failed at attacking. Now the gloves are off

24' An errant elbow from an Espanol defender ends up giving Tahiti their first free kick of the game. Unfortunately it hits the wall

27' Somehow, and they are defending capably. Mata is now taking a free kick as Jerknando Jerkes is taken down outside the box.

30' Torres, Roche is playing extremely well. He's like a male Vaitiare Bandera!

[31' GOAL! David Silva finishes neatly to provide Spain with their second goal. Not much Roche could do about that one.](http://i.minus.com/iFQzKNvShPJqA.gif)

[32' GOAL! It feels like the proverbial floodgates are opening now as Torres saunters onto a long ball in space and skips over the sliding Roche to slot home his second

[35' David Villa is not happy.](http://cdn0.sbnation.com/imported_assets/1103805/sadvilla.jpg)

[38' GOAL! Del Bosque presses right on the D-Pad and sets his team to counter attack

44' Something something Spaniards diving something something.

**HALF-TIME Spain 4 - 0 Tahiti**

[Why don't you check out this short documentary about the Pacific Islander experience in Australian schools.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O5U9irS3iA)

46' Substition: Navas on

48' goal. Spain walk in another goal

51' Call me Torres. Some years ago--never mind how long precisely --having little or no money in my purse

53' Like the male goat mounting the female

53' Substitution Tahiti: Tehau in

54' It's been a while since Tahiti have attacked

[57' Goal! Torres with this hat-trick. He really is an odious twat isn't he?](http://i.imgur.com/lKhT661.gif)

59' Guys I just caught an Eevee in my pokemon game!!!

63' Goal! The Torres/Villa dick-measuring contest continue as Villa pokes the ball into the net after a bad error from Mikael Roche.

64' MOTHER OF GOD TAHITI WITH A GENUINE CHANCE THERE.

65' Goal! Spain score again. My stream is frozen

66' Who is that dude in yellow who just committed a handball? And for those asking I think I want an Espeon :D

68' Spain are entering a dangerous time now

67' David Villa with a free kick after a foul on Squirrel Cazorla

67' Substitution Spain: Mario Gomez' father on for Juan Mata.
Substituion Tehau: Tehau Tehau for Tehau Tehau Tehau.

75' Substitution Spain: Gary Coleman on for Doris Day.

76' Spain are awarded a penalty after a Tahitian handball. Now Torres and Villa will fight to the death to see who can take it. OH MY GOD TORRES HAS MISSED SERIOUSLY WHAT A DRONGO.

77' Goal. I eat my words

80' Is it just me or is this the worst four goal performance from a striker in football history?

84' The world's most intense linesman calls offside to disallow the tenth Spanish goal.

88' Goal. Bla bla bla David Silva little magician bla bla bla. At least it wasn't Torres or Villa

**Spain 10 - 0 Tahiti**

That was seriously the most boring 10-goal game ever. Thanks for making it fun guys!",,t5_2qi58,1371761382.0,,man-city,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1gqn8m/match_thread_spain_vs_tahiti_fifa_confederations/

We have such a diverse community in r/soccer it would be against nature not to pool our expertise and reap the rewards. For example, Inter Milan fans, Liverpool fans, etc, posting information on their possible starting line ups, form of their teams and their predictions for their games. We have an abundance of first hand sources reporting on clubs all around the world, we should be putting this to use as it presents a glorious chance to lose money together as a community.

1304459449.0,h3hgw,To Barcelona supporters,,924,319,285,"Hello

I've noticed recently there's been some discussion over how much Barcelona does (or doesn't) dive. Now, we recognize this as a bad thing, which is why players like Nani or Robin van Persie are often vilified.

Our criticism rests on two points:

1. Barcelona dives more than other teams. Alves dives a lot

2. Barcelona doesn't **need** to dive to win. Barcelona is an amazing team--probably the best in the world right now. When you guys came out against Real Madrid

One comparison I think is especially apt is to Cristiano Ronaldo. Although Ronaldo is perhaps the best player in the world behind Messi, he could be a much more respected player if he cut out diving from his game.

Barcelona prides itself on the purity of its football and condemns ""anti-football"" defensive tactics. I'd like to contend that diving and intimidating the referee is just as much anti-football. We would enjoy seeing you play and respect you as a team much more if you would follow Messi's example and stay on your feet.

Thanks for reading

TL;DR We're holding you to a high standard because we love you.
