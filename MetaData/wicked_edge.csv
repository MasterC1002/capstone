1366746789.0,1cyh0x,How Wicked Edge Saved My Life,jon94,340,77,73,"In my sophomore year of high school (2009), I decided that I didn't want to. Around June of 2010

Fast forward to January 2013. As I've mentioned in other posts, it's easy to get beaten down.

As if this wasn't enough, but mostly, to put it bluntly, she had problems with being honest and faithful. I immediately fell back into the self harm and depression, and began living in the library so I could at least feel successful at something in my life. 

I knew I needed something, anything, to distract me (studying Chemsitry all night doesn't really help in that department). I had been using the AoS set up for a while, but with a cartridge razor. I'd always wanted to try the real deal, so I eventually saved my pennies and bought myself a shavette and one of WhippedDog's straight razors. 

The difference this seemingly menial task made in my life was unbelievable. Taking the time to strop a blade properly, and then shave with care and focus cleared my head and allowed me 20 minutes of time free of any thought beyond blade angle, pressure, and grain. No Biology, no girlfriends, nothing but the ringing of hair cut by a full hollow blade.

Even with my newfound (and still being found) peace of mind, scotch is second only to straight razors). I called her to thank her, and we began talking again. Before I knew it, we were pretty much back together. 

Now I'm sure y'all are waiting for the twist, you're right. To the second group, you've clearly seen this situation before. After about a week of being with this girl, she informs me that she made out with her best guy friend the day after my birthday. I sort of shrugged it off since we still weren't really together at that point. Over the past week though, the situation evolved from a one-time accidental drunk makeout to ""I think I love him and have to try it so I can know."" On Sunday night, after admitting that she knew how much she was hurting me by doing this and that she realized how unfairly she had treated me, she decided to break up with me and be with him.

For those of you waiting for the twist, I finished my work at the library and came home. It was well after 2:00 AM (remember, us college students keep odd hours), and I walked into my completely dark room. I set my things down and went into the bathroom, rummaging through my shave kit until I found what I was looking for: a brand new and razor sharp Gillette Platinum double edged razor blade. 

I ran some hot water and lathered up. Thank you

I have just come to the realization

I'd heard that a sharp straight razor can give you a good shave, a cartridge razor), so I went and bought a nice expensive Dovo cutthroat.

Tried it once

Went to a specialty razor shop

Since then, tried the hair trick, could not get the hair to balance on the blade for long enough (how _do_ you do that?), did the stroppy thing with the paste I was given at the shop, taking extra mega crazy care to not even _think_ about putting the edge on the strop (or any other surface) the wrong way, and went to work.

I'm blond, with somewhat sensitive skin (thickened by a lifetime of cynicism and snark) can't really judge how thick or rough my stubble is compared to others' (I'm not in the habit of sneakily feeling strange men's beards) but I assume it's sort of ""medium"".

So, I'm so naturally butt-white that I don't need that) straight out of the nice piping hot shower, face full of heated Art of Shaving oil (yes I am sure there are vastly better brands made by blind Tibetan monks out of yak secretions, and I can make my own for a lot cheaper by boiling potato oil through a homemade still at midnight on a full moon, but I kind of assumed that this should do the trick to _some_ degree).  

Using LaToja cream out of a tube (the red stuff - I read somewhere that it's pretty good, squeezed some into a copper bowl with a bit of hot water, whipped up a good lather, and applied with a badger brush.  I have no idea which of this is relevant, but given the hilariously absurd amount of attention to detail in the various instruction pages (""ensure a precisely 32.7 degree angle after using water heated to **exactly** - this is important -- 78° C in a 20% brimstone, 80% Lutetium alloy bowl otherwise you will DIE, FOOL"") I figure

I'm also sure I should probably be using the 1915 model LaBourrée-Stinkfinger 15mm Toledo special, and my ancestors seemed to do a reasonable job removing hair from face, and they thought the Earth was flat and women were too dumb to vote, so it's not a far stretch that I, as the pinnacle of 45,000 years of human evolution should be able to fucking shave.

I don't know about you

a) doesn't take half the morning

b) does not leave my face a cratered

c) removes whiskers from aforementioned face

Let's perform a gap analysis vis-à-vis above deliverables:

a) Fail.  Cause:  most likely lack of practice and clue and little-girl level of squeamishness when it comes to the possibility of self-inflicting serious bodily harm with an instrument not necessarily designed by Klaus the Angry Master German Knifemaker with the express purpose of being hidden down a vengeful Sicilian's boot and used to motivate some _paisan_ to repay his debt (or to get him to repay in kind with a finger or part of his ear)

b) Fail.  I've seen photos of the Somme battlefield after Maj. Gen. Lord F'tang-F'tang Ole Biscuit Barrel, decided it would be a good idea to match his men's naked valor against entrenched Hun machine guns, that involved less blood and cratering than my mug.  I did not know that the human body contained this much blood.  I think I can see the bone.  On the back of my head.  I don't need a styptic pencil, I need a styptic paintbrush, you know, the big ones that the house painters use.

c) No Less Than Total Fail.  With remarkable German technological efficiency, which involved removing a greasy batter of gore, shaving cream, oil, drool, and tears from pretty much every nook and cranny in my bathroom.    

I ended up having to clean up my face with my safety razor (some sort of random blades, I am not a scientist, but empirically speaking, this cannot be the point of the exercise.

I fenced and did Kendo for a few years.  I was never very good at it, I don't think they could have inflicted the kind of damage that I managed to do this morning.  

What am I doing wrong?  Please?  Help me?  It is irking me.  Also

_Edit:_ since I'm being called out for a bunch of stuff

- ""You are a n00b"" - yes I am.  Utterly so.  This is why I come to the masters as a humble supplicant.
- ""You are being disrespectful"" - geez, nor to attempt phrasing my plea for advice in a form that I'd hoped would at least be halfway entertaining.  Next time I shall try monosyllabic guttural grunts and bullet points right off the bat. 
- ""You are not telling us about technique"" - I stretch the skin, don't apply pressure.  I've tried various angles, various degrees of pressure, even shaving against the grain or multiple strokes.  I'm willing to try anything.  Apologies if I'm missing anything here, I'm simply not aware of some subtle elements of ""technique"".  It's shaving, ffs.
- ""You are impatient"" - I'm 39.  I've taught myself 2 languages.  I've been with the same woman for almost half my life.  I'm long past the age of throwing VCRs through windows when I can't figure out how to set the clock (one of the great things about being my age is that I now earn enough to buy high-powered handguns, I'd just say ""fuck this"" and leave the razor buried in the rear left tire of the son of a bitch who keeps taking my parking space.  Rather, I am trying something new that I have read copious good things about, and am trying to figure out how to do it right.  Half an hour is fine, I understand it takes time.  I'm giving myself at least that amount of time from start to finish, if only to avoid removing major facial features.  Cut me some slack.
- ""What is your DE / if you keep cutting yourself with your DE why do you use it"" - It says ""Merkur Super"" and ""Platinum Coated"" on it.  Super is good, it says ""Made in Germany"". I didn't think Germans were allowed to sell shitty knives, or they get made fun of and taken outside to be beaten by Klaus.  The DE works.  Kind of.  I've been using it for two years now because it's cheaper and it makes me feel manlier and more ready to go wrestle bears 'n shit.  Chicks dig that.  But I like choice, y'know?  It's the essence of why we won the Cold War.  But even after 2 years, I still face (ha ha) the choice of either looking like John Travolta/Nicholas Cage in Face/Off or having sweetie complain about stubble during private time.  This shall not stand.
- ""Honing / Sharpening"" - I appear to have offended at least one person by Doing It Wrong.  WTF do I know?  I tried it straight out of the box, RTFM, so I RTFM'ed and plunged straight down the fucking rabbit hole of really obscure sharpening videos and calculating techniques for getting the optimum analog gain from your razor blade.  I already caught shit for trying to use the factory hone, so I had it sharpened.  That didn't work, so I stropped it.  What am I supposed to do?  I appreciate that this is as much art as science, but it can't be _that_ complicated, can it?  I mean, not beat Battletoads.
- ""You're giving us too much detail about toys"" - well hey
- ""You need to practice"" - okay, as a reasonably adaptable, somewhat resourceful and moderately intelligent person, I'm expecting 10, 20, 50, 100
- ""Try turning it off and then on again"" - I can't find the switch underneath all the blood.",self,t5_2s46m,1353171970.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/13cgjy/one_hairy_hamburger_rare_and_bloody_please/

I am 42 yrs old and have always disliked shaving. From my days in the Navy, to trying to find the best cartridge razor/shaving cream/aftershave/voo-doo witch doctor chant for a close, comfortable shave.

About a year and a half ago, aftershave balm) from The Art Of Shaving as a gift and I fell in love with making my own lather (which, incidentally sucked). I subsequently lost the brush while traveling, and in looking for a new one, found W_E.

Since then

* A new beaver brush (the reason I came here)
* Leisureguy's book (Kindle version)
* Edwin Jagger DE89lbl razor with sample pack
* Proraso pre/post shave cream
* Proraso shaving soap
* Mitchell's Wool Fat shaving cream
* Jojoba oil
* Alum Block

Fine. It's money. I've wasted more on dumber things

Ok

You see, and come to WE. Oh look, some more posts by n00bs like me that are having the same issues I am! Hey, look!! Some great responses with good advice! I should try that! Come to think of it, I have a free hour and I need to shave! Time to go put these tidbits into practice!

So I go have a nice hot shower, but definitely not the worst. And I am not bleeding.

So, and more likely 2 days from now, to put those into practice. 48 hrs of waiting to shave again. And I just know this whole cycle will repeat itself again on that day, and I am helpless to stop it.

I hate you guys.

Would anybody be interested in seeing blades under a scanning electron microscope? I could take a brand new feather blade and only shave on one side of it and show a side-by-side comparison.

I could also do a characteristic X-ray analysis on it and tell you what elements are present in the blades.

I found myself thinking about him every time i shaved

It makes me wonder what type of man he was.  I never knew my dad growing up so i had no idea what it meant to be a man. I often reflect on what kind of man i am

Taking your time and shaving properly allows men to think about things we would not normally think about

I think these sort of actions are what helps define us as modern men and what it is to be a man.

i see a lot of posts on here about the kits everyone uses

I'm more interested in why do you shave the way you do? did it start off as something that looked cool and grow into something more

An alum block's purpose is to serve as a skin treatment, but that use is secondary. It will stop bleeding from weepers, but a real nick or cut is beyond its pay grade, at least for me. NOTE: Some men's skin is sensitive to alum and they simply cannot use it: skin turns red, gets hot, becomes irritated, etc. 

In using the block, dry, and apply aftershave. Rinsing helps prevent the alum from drying the skin; alum crystals used as deodorants are not rinsed---these are generally ammonium alum, but occasionally you'll find one that's potassium alum (e.g., [Naturally Fresh](http://www.amazon.com/Naturally-Fresh-Deodorant-Crystal-4-25-Ounce/dp/B002JVWU2E/ref=sr_1_10?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1359049817&amp;sr=8-10&amp;keywords=deodorant+crystal)) that can then be used as an alum block. (Ammonium alum stings too much for pleasant use.)

Powdered alum does work well as a styptic---at any event, has these ingredients:

&gt;Aluminum Chloride, Methylcellulose, Phenyl Salicylate, Bergamot (Citrus Aurantium Bergamia) Oil, Vitamin A &amp; E, Aloe Vera (Aloe Barbadensis) Leaf Juice

Another popular styptic is Pacific Shaving's Nick Stick. Its ingredients:

&gt;SD Alcohol (Ethyl Alcohol), Aluminum Chloride Hexahydrate, Tocopherol (Vitamin E), Citrus Aurantium Bergamia (Bergamot) Fruit Oil, Hydroxypropylcellulose

Clubman Nick Relief lists only Aluminum Sulfate as an active ingredient. 

You'll note that none of these contain potassium alum (aka potash alum), it is not very good as a styptic. Those listed are quite good styptics. I don't know the ingredients of Proraso styptic gel, but I would wager that it also does contains no potassium alum.

I should also speak to the continuing speculation (not

Aluminum may or may not be a health risk, for example, is definitely a health risk---indeed, it's deadly---but as part of the compound sodium chloride (table salt) it is necessary for life. (Salt can, of course, be a health risk if overused, but that health risk has nothing whatsoever to do with chlorine per se.)

TL;DR: An alum block and a styptic serve different purposes and are not redundant. An alum block is not a health risk.

I'm a year 12 student in Australia, just a mo and goatee, I trim it I swear) but it is decent length and I'm gonna shave it all off! And I'll be shaving my head too.

I also hope to show some of the guys in my year who I can see struggle with their electrics or Gillette Pro Fusion Mach 500 Quantum Extra VII the real deal.

As an added bonus

[Here](http://my.leukaemiafoundation.org.au/aydengraham) is my page where you can donate! Thank you!

Also

&gt; Can someone sponsor me from overseas?
Of course!

&gt;- Our system accepts donations in Australian dollars via VISA and MasterCard from overseas

&gt;- Make sure your sponsor selects their country FIRST when they're entering their address details so that our system will accept a non-Australian address

&gt;- Your online donors will still receive a receipt via email but they'll need to check with their financial advisor about whether the donation is tax-deductible if they live outside Australia


I also wanna say a massive thank you to all of Wicked_Edge

Thank you!

Update: It went pretty well

[Here is a large album](http://imgur.com/a/568IQ), unfortunately. Wetshaving has definitely helped control my acne though.

I also ended up shaving the legs of some guy who had a botched wax job, so there's some hope! One of us.

* Risk of cuts. You're handling something very sharp

I wanted to give myself a back-to-school present, said I wanted a shave, and I was led to the barber chair.

Here's where things go awry:

The barber, put the pre-shave oil on, and then proceeded to lather my face with shaving cream. (Without a brush, mind you.) 

The shave was extremely rushed. So rushed in fact that I was actually scared that he was going to do some serious damage. He made about 9 or 10 strokes before wiping the blade on the towel each time (Which seemed like a bit much.) Altogether, and after shave stuff only lasted a total of about 15 minutes, at most.

I paid and left, and he completely missed several spots behind my jaw-line. The bottom of my neck was also extremely irritated with bumps everywhere.

When I compare this to Wicked_Edge the comparison is quite stunning. When I log on I see the same deluge of ""first shave!"", that excitement, and we want to help out and make a brother (or more rarely, a sister) feel good about what path they've set out upon. Within the discussions people continuously answer the same questions from beginners (how many times have *you* seen Leisureguy link to a distiller water shave!), and they do it with good humor and enthusiasm. People post pictures of gear which for the most part is entirely un-unique - yet even these pictures are up voted because people on *this* subreddit want people to feel excited and accepted by this community.

I personally have been here nearly a year. I first stumbled across it through r/malefashionadvice or r/malegrooming or something, my photos of new gear were excitedly commented on by others, I bought a third razor off the shave_bazaar, and before long I was posting on other people's questions because -thanks to this subreddit - I had all the information to answer the questions, also informed by my own experiences and experimentation.

&gt;@alfredenigma: Yes they have forums with thousands of lusers that they give specific instructions to come here and down vote my WOOTs the owners and operators of these forums also own online razor shops...
An exact quote I just pulled off one of the forums today:
[–]jersully 
DO go downvote the product on Woot's page (registration required
It would be one thing if a WOOTer had an issue and downvoted a vendor/product however this weekly shill-bidding from the competition is rather immature. They are just a bit angry at the new kid on the block that wont play by their ""rules"".

Luke

My response:
&gt;@straightrazor: Oh look there you go with the slander again. No one on that post owns a shaving business. If your going to quote someting you should link it as well http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/o6so4/do_not_buy_the_straight_razor_leather_cloth_strop/ 

&gt;And why should anyone buy that pocket knife

I was shaving with triple blade Gilette disposables and canned cream for a few years, finally settling on these. Not particularly happy, not too sad.

After that, reading up on products and technique and I like the results. No big casualties, except a few ear-nicks (with shavette) and sometimes a little skin irritation due to too much pressure or too many passes. Shaves have progressed from passable to smooth and likeable. I can usually get only 2 shaves out of a razor blade, with the notable exception of yellow Bic, that dies after a single shave..

I'm currently using a cheap Wilkinson bristle brush and ARCO soap. For backup I have a can of proraso foam (haven't needed it for a while). Going to upgrade the brush soon and lusting after a straight razor

Aaanyway. The question has been nagging at the back of my head. Is the DE really better than the multiblades? There is a lot of talk about skin irritation and the superiority of DE

So I went to the store

Took a shower, XTG), being light with pressure and... [cue the drumroll]

It was ok.

I would say, after mach 3 they feel more ""duller"" when rubbing with fingers, if it makes sense. I don't know if I'm going to wake up tomorrow with a horrible razor rash and thousand ingrown hair, but at the moment, I'm confused.

What to make of this? 

I realize ""mileage may vary"". There is certainly carryover of skills from shaving with DE. Chrome looks and feels fantastic. Razor blades are cheaper than cartridges. There is that manly man feel when handling sharp

But I don't know at the moment, ""comparable"" in performance.

If you remember the time when decent digital cameras entered the market, forever and irreplaceable. Now, digital surpasses film in many respects and this movement is reduced to mostly hipsters, poor students and artists who prefer the particular subtle ""look and feel"" of the process or result. Most people, who either do photography for a living or just want to take pictures, have moved on to digital.

Is DE and straight razor fandom a similar phenomenon, unforgiving learning instrument? Would just a little bit of education and technique make multiblades shine in performance?

Discuss.

TL;DR Mach 3 ""is ok"".

Edit: 

Thank you for your thoughts. It has been a refreshing experience to read these answers and it has helped me with this philosophical and spiritual snag.

This ""experiment"" was mostly inspired by bloggers and forum members, less skin irritation and ingrown hair as the main reasons to switch over, claiming that cartridge razors are ""pure evil"". I didn't feel that was quite right, at least in my case. 
Still, but they are expensive.

To those who asked: I'm still alive and well the day after. No signs of razor burn

The product being offered on this deal is a pocket knife shaped like a straight razor. The steel is not tempered correctly and will not hold an edge. 

The seller is using a kitchen knife sharper to hone the razors as he has yet to provide any proof otherwise. You can shave your arm hair or legs with a pocket knife but never try to shave your face with one. 

I got this deal a while back and honed the razor up myself and the blade was tugging after half a pass on my cheek hair. Technique is not the issue the steel is.

1326209913.0,oawmo,"Dear Wicked Edge, I'm about ten shaves in, and I've decided to make a list of noobie mistakes I've made that I wish I'd read.",MontyAtWork,147,62

1.) Shower first before a shave when starting out.

I never was used to showering before a shave and I can tell you that for ANY beginner, don't give your face more reasons to be torn up.

2.) Pre shave soap is more like pre lather than it is a face wash (ie

The pre shave soap has work to do on your face during the shave so washing it off defeats the purpose. I now think of it as an ingredient like in a baking recipe

3.) If you're using a small bowl with a puck in it

I got a Van der Hagen premium shave set and just put the puck in the bowl. Well the lather would build between the puck and bowl at the bottom and getting it out of there was a pain. The reason is that the bowl was meant to not have the puck in it

3.) Flick your razor over the water after you rinse between passes.

I was just dipping it in the water

4.) If the lather feels pasty

5.) Lathering is messy!

I was used to can shaving cream that came out basically the same every time and I'd apply it as needed. With a brush, and using a brush on your face isn't as mess free as a little canned shaving cream on your hand.

6.) Do NOT make a pass over unlathered skin!

Did you do a terrible pass just now compared to your other passes

7.) Listen to your razor

My beard grows upwards on either side of my throat until it suddenly changes to the opposite direction. For me this is literally an abrupt change on my neck. With lather on my face

So that's my advice and as always

**EDIT** 8.) As Han Solo says to Luke when he successfully shoots down a TIE fighter

My first two shaves were incredible. No irritation, i went against everything I listed here (not showering first, pasty and thin lather etc) and boy did i destroy my face. It seemed that I'd lucky not to have both physical and emotional scars from it for the rest of my life. Confidence should be based on a LONG history of good shaves, which, two shaves, does not qualify as. Pay as much attention on every shave as you did for your best, and most careful shave.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/oawmo/dear_wicked_edge_im_about_ten_shaves_in_and_ive/

Her grandfather was a US Navy lifer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Most of the time, my mother-in-law just does his shaves with a Mach 3 and some Barbasol, so for his birthday shave I offered to do the honors with my kit. So I packed up my Dovo and silvertip brush, some Art of Shaving soap and my bottle of Ogallala Bay Rum and headed over to their house. I swore on my mother's life I wouldn't cut him. It took me about 35 minutes to do everything, and it was kind of difficult to stretch his skin just right to get the proper passes. All in all, my mother-in-law was in tears and Grandpa told me some stories about how he used to go to barbershops and have a smoke and get a shave. It was truly a wonderful experience.

I'm a straight razor shaver and I think most of us regulars who use straight razors all know each other in this sub and in other shaving communities.  We are a smaller group than the DE shavers and I think we can/should take some steps to help grow the straight razor numbers.

First

* *""You should use a DE first""*:  A DE is not a prerequisite to straight razor shaving and there's really nothing in DE shaving technique that translates to straight razor shaving.  You need to learn how to use an open blade no matter if you're coming from cartridges or safety razors.

* *""Straight razors are expensive""*: Good starter kits can be found at affordable prices

* *""Straight razors are dangerous""*: All razors are equally dangerous and I challenge anyone to show evidence that straight razor users get more cuts than DE users

* *""Straight razors are hard to learn""*: If you start out with a proper blade and do a little bit of reading

* *""You'll ruin your first strop""*:  Strops get nicks in them

* *""Straight razors are out of stock""*: Dovo has had some supply issues

Another thing we can work on is helping our new straight razor members.  When someone is having trouble with those first few shaves, those of us experienced straight razor users can point the OP in the right direction to help them along.

Lastly, collecting, and restoring straights for more than a year.

I would never encourage anybody to buy a razor without seeing it first.  The money you're saving isn't because someone didn't have to ""take time to post the pictures""

My second comment is about what ""cosmetic flaw"" means.  To me, uneven edge, and active rust are all *functional* flaws, and the majority of unseen razors have at least one of those attributes.  

There are other vendors who sell restored antiques at affordable prices

**TL;DR**: A lot of info about straight razor shaving given by people who've never used a straight razor

Straight razors give the best shave.  As a community we should encourage people to strive for their best shave with the tools that they want.  If someone starts out properly and does a little bit of reading then they can pick up straight razor shaving relatively quickly.

EDIT: Since many people are hung up on my TLDR about ""the best shave"", or with a cartridge, or with your Bowie knife, but the SR will be the constant as you get full control of the edge sharpness and shaving angle.  Getting those ideal circumstances is what takes much more patience, and to me that was part of the enjoyment of learning.",,False,t5_2s46m,True

As the Mod I try hard to not get involved unless I have no choice and it's for the good of the community as a whole that I need to intercede. I didn't move as fast as some would have liked today as I wanted to allow both sides a public forum to state their sides of the story.

While this did happen there were a few individuals who decided that shall we say ""behavior not becoming a member of wicked_edge"" was the order of the day.  These individuals have been removed from our community

We lost 4 members today because someone decided to bring a personal issue up as a public one. I'm sickened that I had to do this

I need you all to help me going forward. There are 3 items I need you to use when needed. 

#1. Downvote: Asshole/ignorant/douchebag comments get the downarrow. Not ones you don't agree with
#2. Report: Hit the ""report"" link under any submission or comment that you see that violates the 3 rules. (see below). This immediately flags them for my attention.
#3. Message: To the right there is a ""Message the Moderators"" link. That's a separate mailbox that goes directly to me and lets me know of trouble. Think of it as the bat signal - not a toy

That brings me to the somewhat known  (but should be blindingly obvious) rules of wicked_edge

#1. Thou shall not be a dick
#2. Thou shall not be a spammer
#3. Thou shall not be a recruiter for other forums.

2. To clarify

3. You can recommend other forums (sharpoligist, but don't let it be your only answer to a question. I'm not kidding we actually had ""You need to go to {REDACTED} and ask your question to get a good answer"" as a response to a post.

 
To those who were appalled at the posts today please accept my sincere apology for what you read - I hoped that it would self correct more than it did and I know it cost us subscribers above the ones who were banned today. In trying to be fair I allowed this to go longer than it should have hoping that decency and sanity would prevail but sadly the result was exactly what I tried to avoid. 

I don't repeat mistakes - I promise you all that this will not happen again.

Your humble mod

Betelgeux.

EDIT: The response and support you all have provided either in here or via PM have shown your character /r/Wicked_edge - I couldn't be more honored to be your mod than I am at this moment. The actions of a few do NOT reflect on the majority and your honor is apparent in both the response I received in the eye of the storm and after the fact. 
Other Mods have commented that it's a thankless job

I'm by choice the single Mod here and its mostly because you all make it so easy. It's a little /r/circlejerk but you all make it what it is - almost no post or comment gets turfed because there is almost no need to deny it. 

The rage you demonstrated against the issue and the childish comments by way of PM's, that's the TOTAL comments and submissions that I've had to turf since we started 15 months ago. 

Thanks for reminding me that the few are not the whole and we are better than this. I remain your loyal mod

First Straight Razor Shave


Shaving with a straight razor is one of life’s great pleasures. Once you become proficient you can enjoy the closest and most comfortable shaves you have ever experienced. You will actually find yourself looking forward to shaving every day instead of considering shaving a chore.

Shaving with a straight razor should be considered an “Art” and like all arts, shaving with the straight razor will give you an entirely new perspective of the process.

Let’s take a few minutes and explore some basic concepts that will help you get started.

Get to know the feel of your razor. This may seem a very simple task and one not worthy of mention, don’t try to shave with it. The grip should also be firm for shaving. You do not want to squeeze the razor tightly or hold it loosely in your hand. A comfortable feel is what you are looking for.

In addition to a comfortable feel the proper angle for cutting hair/whisker with a straight razor is usually 30 degrees or less. This may seem very straight forward

Start with a razor that has been professionally honed. What this means is that the razor you intend to shave with should be shave ready. A shave ready razor is one that has been professionally honed and tested to ensure it will shave. In most circumstances your razor will be packed in some type of oil and will have been stropped prior to you receiving it. You will need to rinse the oil off the razor prior to use. You may have been told that stropping prior to shaving with a new razor is not necessary. It may not be

Stropping your razor should consist of 30-50 strokes on a leather strop prior to shaving. The spine of the razor should lead on all strokes with the strop. This means also that the edge of the razor should be trailing. The stroke should be very even in both directions with minimal pressure on the strop. Both the spine and the edge should remain on the strop throughout the stroke. Do not turn the razor over when you change the stroke direction by rolling the razor on its edge. The razor should only be rolled on its spine to prevent damage to both your strop and razor. It is also important to make sure you do not lift the razor up at the end of a stroke in either direction as you may end up dulling the edge of the razor or damaging your strop.

Beard preparation is also a very important aspect to consider prior to your first straight razor shave. Many people shave after they come out of the shower to ensure that the beard is clean and prepared for soaping prior to the shave. Some people still utilize a hot towel over the face before shaving cream

We are now ready to start to learn how to shave with the straight razor. The anticipation of most people and the expectation of the greatest shave you ever had in your life makes what you will read next very important. It is NOT recommended that you try to shave your entire face the first time you shave with a straight razor. What you learn next and the time you devote to learning it

Your first day shaving with the straight razor should involve a with the grain (WTG) or stroke from your sideburn down to the jaw on the side of your dominant hand. This is where you want to remember that 30 degree angle or less. Very little pressure should be utilized. Be relaxed. Short strokes of approximately one inch should be utilized down to the jaw line and then several little longer strokes can be used to go back and clean up any remaining hair/whisker in this area. Once you have accomplished this

On day two, using the dominant hand, but you now can add the cheek area on that side from where the beard starts and shave WTG down to the jaw line above the neck. The real key is to get comfortable with the razor and determine how the cutting angle feels for you and then develop a comfort level with the actual shaving by working through sections of your face rather than tackling the whole face at one time. There are many different angles involved in shaving your face and the more you get comfortable with the razor and these angles the easier it will be to develop the necessary techniques to shave the chin and try across the grain (XTG) or against the grain strokes(ATG) should you desire without nicking or cutting your face up along the journey. Always remember, if something doesn’t feel right or you feel a pulling or tugging that you should not, STOP! It is much easier to take a step back and sort it out prior to a nick or discomfort.

Now

The next step will be really fun for most of you. We are now going to start shaving the other side of the face. The fun part here though, before you get started here, you really want to get used to how the razor feels in the non dominant hand and how the grip feels. This may take a day or two, but it is worth the effort. Once comfortable, with the holding the razor in the non dominant hand, only take on the opposite side of the face from the sideburn to the jaw line again and that’s it for that day. Again, once you are comfortable with shaving this area

Finally, the sides of the chin and the chin itself. The chin usually will only need a WTG stroke for that BBS feeling although some people will go back and use an XTG stroke for the chin and chin sides.

The time you have spent up to this point has served to lay a foundation for successful and enjoyable straight razor shaving for the rest of your life. From here you can experiment and decide whether you want to try XTG strokes from each ear to the chin on each side of the face and ATG strokes from the lower part of the neck to the chin line. Remember to use both hands. You should also work with your face to stretch the skin in directions that will pick up those areas where the hair may grow in unconventional directions

Many times a really smooth shave is accomplished with only two full passes and some touch up work. Some people do use three full passes

Like every other aspect of wet shaving and straight razor shaving

It is not uncommon for the face to be a little dry or red as it gets use to the straight razor for the first couple days. A nice aftershave balm should feel great.",self,t5_2s46m,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1kct9j/first_straight_razor_shaveread_first/

I had no intention of trying to get this off the ground

It moved along slowly and then 2 months ago

About a month ago we had a prototype and had to wait for reddit's approval on the design.  Then there was some issues with setting up Gifts &amp; Care(based in spain) to sell on the [reddit store](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/vie-long-horse-badget-shaving-brush/9199/) since they've never set up a merchant based outside of the United States.

The horse/badger mix with a 24mm knot set at 50mm was the majority vote when we polled the community.  Gifts &amp; Care pays 25% of the sales to reddit for licensing the snoo.  The brush is sold on their website for a couple dollars more without the logo

**I wanted to clarify:** I am in no way affiliated with Gifts &amp; Care

[The Brush is Available Here](http://redditgifts.com/marketplace/product/vie-long-horse-badget-shaving-brush/9199/).  Hope you all enjoy!

I spent the next couple of weeks being Wetshaving's answer to Towlie from South Park. Just the mention of a razor and I appeared. Once we passed about 500 users I slowed down on the promotion messages because I figured that that was likely nearing the top of what we'd get for subscribers.

Since then we've grown to almost 4000 users and over 100

I'm floored. I never expected this to get this big and the even more impressive thing is there is actually very little work I need to do as a mod. Spam is nil (the filter traps one legit post from time to time). I almost never bust out the [M] tag because for the most part you all make it unnecessary.

We've got a ton of experience and even the newer users are comfortable in offering advice to others. I couldn't have asked for a better group.

I may have started this place but you all have turned it into the community it is.

**1. Detailed Grain Mapping**

The ""grain"" of the beard--the direction(s) the hairs grow in--can be completely counter-intuitive when it comes to the neck.  They can even sometimes grow in a circular pattern.  Understanding how the hair grows on your neck is the first step in overcoming shaving problems there.  You can find grain mapping aids on Sharpologist.com (and I have added them to this newsletter too).  Shaving with the grain initially is one of the basic concepts in shaving


**2. Careful Preparation**

Properly preparing the skin of the neck is often overlooked: copious amounts of hot water or gently cleaning the skin on the face often overlooks the neck.  Pay attention and be sure that warm towel or ""barbershop prep"" lather covers the neck!


**3. Pre-shave Oil**

I'm not a big fan of pre-shave oils but some have found that applying some on the neck helps reduce irritation.


**4. Use Cold Water To Shave**

Consider


**5. Use A ""Gentle"" Razor With A High-Performance Blade**
This might be tougher to do with a cartridge razor since alternative blade sources may not be available but in the case of cartridge razors it's probably safe to say that fewer blades will yield less irritation.  However that is not ""etched in stone"" so some experimentation may be necessary.  For DE razor users this might seem counter-intuitive as well but a ""gentle"" razor with a small safety bar gap (Merkur Classic,"" reducing the chance for irritation.


**6. Use An Adjustable DE Razor**

Although there are not many choices (Merkur Progress/Futur/Vision or a vintage adjustable)


**7. Flattening--Not Over-Stretching--The Skin**

Let's face it


**8. Use No Pressure On The Razor**

No pressure means NO PRESSURE!


**9. Try Some ""Advanced"" Shaving Tricks On Small Areas**

This is not for everyone but if you have small areas of stubble or rough patches you can try some techniques like ""J-Hooking"" or ""Blade Buffing"" to cover those areas without re-shaving--and possibly getting irritation--over a wider area.  However over-doing these advanced techniques can be a prescription for trouble if not done carefully and judiciously.


**10. Settle For Less**

Do you really need that ""baby's butt smooth"" neck?  Maybe it's time to skip that third pass and just go for looking presentable.

1363963577.0,1asu6x,A girl's findings of her double edge shaving experiment,Jaqacake,105,17,30,"I guess this is kinda my 'review' of my experience so far

I've been doing it for a couple of months, palmolive shave stick ~75p, brush from chemist ~£5) in fear of shelling out and finding I just couldn't get on with it.  I've now decided my experiment has paid off and invested in some better kit, which I'm hoping will make things even better as the blades I've been using really could be sharper.

**What's my hair like?**

I'm not especially hairy

**Why did I try switching to DE shaving?**

Primarily because I like to shave my lady bits.  The problem I've always had though was irritation

My initial set up, so I decided to spend the money trying something different instead.

**How do my experiences with DE shaving compare to cartridge razors?**

Previously I used a gillette venus with 5 blades.  So I guess a single pass with that is dragging 5 blades across my skin as opposed to one blade with the DE.

**Legs**: not much difference, then a couple of extra passes where I seem to have missed.  It does take longer to lather up properly rather than just shave using my body wash.  I haven't tried just using the body wash with the DE razor (mostly because it's still novel to use a brush and it doesn't really take that long).

Now reading the information on this forum I'm apparently supposed to do lots of little strokes

**Underarms**: Improvement, although it doesn't take much longer and takes about as long to lather up properly on my underarms as I used to take with body wash (between passes I can lather it back up in seconds with one hand while rinsing off the razor with the other).  The improvement is that I now have no irritation, my underarms look a lot closer to those in a dove deodorant commercial than before (when there was always a bit of a rash).  Ingrown hairs were rare here but I haven't had any since.  I previously and still do shave my underarms every time I shower.

**Pubic region**: This is where the difference is really noticeable.  Here I do the most passes, it wouldn't surprise me if some areas are gone over 10 times though.  I still have some redness although I've now bought some blade sample packs and I'm hoping this will improve matters over the boots blades I got with the cheapo razor.  I haven't had any ingrown hairs since (although not sure why a razor would make a difference?) and any irritation fades much quicker - I can shave every day without problem and overall the area has a better appearance, although mostly I don't do it every day because it still takes a while and I can't be bothered in the shower.

**What about cutting yourself?**

I've only cut myself once

Although normally

Aside from that

However it is worth noting that I don't think the blades I've been using so far - the ones which came with the cheapo razor - are particularly sharp

**Overall opinion?**

Much better

Leaving allowance to buy more blades and soap for the rest of the year I expect my costs of buying both razors and everything else for to be a little higher than what I'd usually spend on cartridges in a year but significantly lower than if I replaced the cartridge as often as I'd like.  Importantly though it doesn't feel as much of a 'waste' and begrudged spend as buying new cartridges do though

I'd just like to persuade my boyfriend that he should give it a try.  He doesn't like wet shaving because of the irritation

**Update that no-one will see**

My new razor arrived and tried a shave with that, and I can safely say buying better equipment is well worth it, best shave ever and you can't even feel it (beyond something gliding smoothly across your skin anyway).  I finally understand it when a bloke says they enjoy their morning shave.",,False,self,t5_2s46m,,http://www.reddit.com/r/wicked_edge/comments/1asu6x/a_girls_findings_of_her_double_edge_shaving/

My recipe (single small batch):
4oz Vodka
2oz Rum (I used Mount Gay
1/4 Tbsp Crushed allspice (Buy the whole allspice and smash it...the scent is better)
1/8 Tbsp Crushed black pepper (Buy the whole peppercorn and smash it...the scent is better)
Zest from one lime
1-2 Cinnamon sticks
6-8 Drops Bay Essential Oil

I put it all in a mason jar and let it sit in a dark cupboard for five days

I then picked up a small Oil Cruet from Target for $1.00 and bottled it.  According to the wife, more subtle and much cleaner. She loved it, which is what matters.

On March first I experienced the biggest pain I ever felt in the whole twenty five years I've been living. I was working from 10:30 am to 6:15 pm, I said to myself ""Hey, it's been a while, I meant to call them but forgot."" And then, I answered the phone...

""Mathieu""

""Hey

""Your father left a suicide note on the table!"" At this point the whole world just crumbled under me but I managed to stay calm.

""Ok, she then passed the phone to the officer that was with her at the time, he explained to me that in his letter my father was talking about a cliff along a path where we went snowshoeing together once last year, I managed to explain how to reach the begining of the path and told him I was coming as fast as I could.

I then called my roommate and told him ""Get the fuck here as soon as you can, he lives three hours away, I told him that if there was a time when he needed to come back home it was right now.

When we reached my parent's house I made some food and I tried to comfort my mother as best as I could while trying to get as much information from the officer as I could get. The waiting game started. My father went deep inside the woods, which slowed him down a lot, in the end we were there for three hours, waiting...

Finally

""They found Paul."" he said

At this point, when I hung up I punched a hole in a door out of anger. My brother arrived not much later, he was frozen, the heater wasn't working in his car and the temperature was below zero. He went to take a shower I needed some grounding, something to bring me back to Earth and help me think more clearly.

I took my father's shaving kit I had given him just a few weeks earlier and I shared one last thing with him

Right now, I'm spending time with my girlfriend but I can't seem to focus when she's talking to me. I don't sleep very well and I try not to think too much. That last thing is why I want to thank you guys, you kept me busy for two days (had I know I would have made the boxes to ship out my kits in advance!) and those were the first two days where I didn't feel empty inside since my father died.

Secondly, on my legs and other bits. Canned shaving gels and foams do nothing - LESS than nothing

**To begin, a shaving brush, and shaving soap/cream. These things are not created equal, and nobody agrees on what’s best, because everyone has different shaving styles and needs and ends up liking different stuff. Here are some things to consider:

**Your razor:** Most women prefer a longer handle, the Parkers get trashed out a lot by menfolk, and probably rightly so, it is NOT an aggressive razor (there are many things that make some razors more aggressive than others - space around the blade edge, angle, etc, but suffice it to say some razors are bitier than others) and is probably frustrating as hell to dudes with extremely tough beards (who should probably be shaving with Merkur Slant Bars, my PUBIC hair - is nowhere near that tough to shave, and it’s still one of my favourites now that I’ve collected a few different razors. I have no problem recommending it as a beginner’s razor for that reason. I do have a Lady Gillette, hoping I figure out the magic angle to make it work well for me

**Razor blades:** there are about a million choices. My favourites, and I’ve never used anything that gave me a finer shave. #2, Astra superior platinum. My third favourite are the 7am platinum coated razor blades. What’s with the platinum coating? It makes the blade corrosion resistant, and they last a lot longer in the shower, which if you’re me, is where you’ll probably keep your razor. The whole bathroom’s humid, anyway. What am I NOT recommending? Those terrible Wilkinson Sword blades that they commonly sell at grocery stores and the like. They’re not very sharp (and therefore drag across instead of cut the hair, which is one of the very things we are trying to avoid, please don’t waste your time. You can get razor blades super cheap off eBay (and any number of other websites!)

Also, rinse it thoroughly, pop your used blades into it. Bang the edge down with a hammer when it gets full (in a few years) and recycle the whole shebang. However you choose to go, please don’t just throw your used blades in the rubbish - your friendly local garbage collector doesn’t need a scare like that.

**Shaving brush:** You want something that holds a lot of water to make a decent lather, for the love of Maude, don’t go out and spend a hundred bucks on a super high quality silvertip badger brush for your beginner brush. I say get a basic “pure” or “best” badger brush - mine was $15 at my local pharmacy in the shave aisle - or a good-quality synthetic if you’re non-animal inclined. You are probably not going to notice the difference in delightful lofty softness between a silvertip and a best badger brush when lathering your legs or armpits, and I find lathering easier with a moderately stiffer brush, anyway. I don’t bother with a shaving mug or cup, I lather on my body, which I’ll discuss in a minute.

**Shaving soap:** this differs from regular soap because it creates a richer lather that protects better. I've tried a few, and at $20 a tub (that lasts months and months), it’s still cheaper than canned shaving gel. Don't be afraid to experiment to find one you like!

Oh, it’s mildly styptic and astringent and helps prevent any irritations and bumps when applied to wet skin post-shave. Lots of people rave about **witch hazel** as an aftershave, too, but I haven’t tried it and I don’t have any dramas just using my alum crystal.

OK

**Technique:** obviously, put conditioner in, and shave while my conditioner’s doing its thing. I point the water away from me so it’s hitting the wall, wet my badger brush, dab it in my shaving cream, and lather one whole leg. If I’m using a hard shaving soap or shave stick, I actually rub it right on my wet skin

Now, do not put *ANY PRESSURE ON THE RAZOR WHATSOEVER*. You’ve probably noticed that your new razor is considerably heavier than a plastic disposable, and the blades are ridiculously sharp. Let the weight of the razor do the work. You’re also wanting about a 30 degree angle between the razor and your skin, but that works itself out pretty naturally if you’re taking your time and not rushing. Use extra caution around anklebones and knees. Rinse the razor under the running hot water after every other stroke (flip the razor over to use both sides for two strokes). And when you finish that first pass on the first leg, feel it - it probably feels pretty smooth. I say leave it at that and do the other leg, and we’ll do against the grain strokes in a few days when you start to get the hang of it. If you do decide to do another pass (against the grain or otherwise), *LATHER UP AGAIN*. Your skin will soon get used to the new regime and your technique will improve over time and with practice, as a seasoned pro, I would've carved myself up like a Virginia ham.

**Underarms**

**Genital bits?** Yep. You bet. Obviously, and again, I get so much less irritation than I used to. It’s a safety razor, not a danger razor, just be careful and you’ll be fine.

When you’re done, and give it a good shake to remove most of the water, then stand it up or hang it to dry. Then, rinse all of your freshly shaven parts in cool water, finish your shower, and when you get out, rub that alum crystal on your still-wet shaven bits. It might sting a little, but only for a second,,False

I had my first DE shave tonight.  Things went horribly, after my first pass I felt like I didn't accomplish anything.  So I decided I needed another in the same direction.  I probably went 3 or 4 times in the same direction, then thought, ""oh yeah XTG.""  Another 3 or 4 passes that way.  Once I was finally (marginally) satisfied, I rinsed off.

Blood.  Blood everywhere.

Shit.  ""Cold water,"" they said.  Then an alum block.  So much fire on my face.  Aftershave.  Nothing could repair the damage I had done.

In retrospect, bad lather, too many passes, repeat strokes without relathering, etc.

It was a mess
