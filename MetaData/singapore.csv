A little backstory first: 

I'm an 18-year-old student in Singapore. I live with 3 siblings (youngest:10, and my paternal grandparents.

Two days ago at school, my house phone had been getting phone calls from unknown numbers and people.

I later found out that my dad had apparently borrowed money from the loan sharks, saying he had ""no face to face you guys anymore"". He left a family of 4 children, his wife, and his **own goddamn parents** to deal with the fallout. He came back in the middle of the night that day, but he left really early in the morning, ignoring me. I left for school, as per normal. When I reached home

Today, my mum had decided to run after my dad. Leaving us alone. I've been told over 10 times that if we don't come up with $350 by tonight, 8PM, they'll come over and break our legs. I'm a student, for fuck's sake. I really don't know what to do. We've tried everything; none of our family members want to help.

We haven't called the police yet

1: We don't know what will happen if we do that. 

2: The police probably won't believe us. A few threatening SMSes

Please

The last straw was when recently I was in the car of one of my superiors of the company I work in. And this guy was someone I looked up to. And in front of me he used terms like Permanent Rubbish and Foreign Trash like I was supposed to agree with him. He was complaining like the typical thing you find on facebook and the Asia One forums. Useless foreigners drive up property prices,000 watch and lives in a upper end condo. As someone who is considering making Singapore my permanent home (i.e citizenship), this hurt me.

I'm an ultra liberal, why am I looked down upon even by the educated, why do people use terms like trash and rubbish to describe me.

The other day I made a call to a real estate agent  and he promptly said no Indians allowed. I looked at my Singaporean friend next to me and he said ""well its their apartment

I feel like the racism is too prevalent

I want everyone to get along, I don't want to become negative living here, I'm an optimist all about world peace, that is my biggest worry, that I become racist too.

From driving on the roads to giving up seats to those more in need. I've seen able-bodied men snatch seats from women, that is - pedestrians having to watch out for cars and sometimes worry that the car won't slow down at zebra crossings! When entering places, some people don't even bother to hold the door open for the next person when they are right behind them. Edit: when on a two way walkway keep to one side and not make people walking in the opposite direction have to squeeze their way through, even when walking up overhead bridges. When on a public bus, not seating on the outer seat when no one is on the inner one. Not standing in front of the bus stop when 10 plus people behind you are trying to look out for their buses.

This problem might have stemmed from school (primary and secondary)

Hey everyone

We will start meeting up at the Botanic Gardens MRT station at approximately 530pm.

2. Alcohol is expensive. I really cannot imagine getting drunk too often in Singapore unless someone points me to a cheap place.

3. It seems that Singaporeans are brand and social conscious. Your standing in life and the brands you wear really make a difference while talking to others.

4. A lot of people are quite active and healthy. This has motivated me to get outside more and run. I often see people running or engaging in other physical activity despite the heat.

5. Traffic is really amazing. Very few traffic jams and nothing as bad as the US.

I am currently facing a very big problem. It's a bit of a long story so please bear with me. 

A little bit of background first: My mum and dad has been divorced for many years. At the moment, even though he gave less than the indicated amount on the court order). My family has been facing financial problems since I was 10-11. I am 24 this year. My younger brother is 20 this year and he is in army at the moment. I am currently finishing my studies this year on September. I study at CGProtege in 3D Modelling in Games and Animation.

Last year

All I know is, and then auction off. Attempts to remove these items are illegal. Now they haven't paste the stickers. Only the letter warning the Writ Of Seizure has been issued. When I was 15, I have nothing at home of value except a refrigerator and a television. So back then, I didn't really care. I just let them take, bought a second hand tv and (where the new fridge came from I forgot, I heard my dad got it from someone, but I can't remember)

Anyway, I have many things that I worked hard for to get them. I saved money to built my own computer, and a laptop that my younger brother and me saved up for a year to buy. I am working part time and studying at the same time. I have no receipt or anything at all to prove all these items are mine. The flat is still under my mum's and dad's name and I understand the Court is legally allowed to seize items in my house. If it was a gaming computer, playstation or whatever, I really don't care. Just let them seize and move on with my life. However, I have no extra money to buy a new computer. I need this computer to do my assignment as all of them are digital work (3D modelling) 

Right now, I do not know whether or not I can still keep my computer for my work. It is my livelihood at the moment. I am making a living from it. 

My situation is at a disadvantage. Firstly, meaning he has asset in this flat. 

Secondly

Thirdly

I hope someone can advice me on what I can do next. All I can think of is

I don't want to sound weak and sobbing

I just thought maybe I can try my luck here

I know this next request might seems outrageous (Sorry...) but if anyone has a place for me to move my stuff temporarily to live in until all this over, sorry for such an outrageous request.

I will also post proof to show that I am not making this story up. 

Thank you for your time in reading this.

edit 2: As I mentioned before

I am not Australian :) I managed to survive 4 years of uni with a tight budget

I spent quite a bit of time in Aus to look for the job that I am interested in but had no luck. You need to have at least Permanent Residency to land in a graduate program. This time I am fortunate enough to receive this job offer from an international company who is world leader in their fields for the position I have always dreamed about. This is one in a life time opportunity for me. It will be hard as first but I believe with time everything will gets much better.

Before I begin I want to emphasize that I don't mean to imply that all Singaporean men are the same/will act the same way- I'm just interested in getting a general idea of what things will be like compared to my experiences with American men. 

-What is the dating scene like? Is it more casual dating (""hanging out"") or do people tend to get into long-term relationships? Is it more common to go out just the 2 of you or in groups?

-What is the attitude toward sex/hooking up? Here

-I'm half white/half Latina. Are men in Singapore generally open to dating other races or is there some sort of taboo that exists?

-Here in the Southern US

-Any other words of advice for me? I'm super attracted to Asian men and am beyond excited to move and meet awesome, not trying to encourage stereotyping or the belief that everyone is the same, just wanting to understand the dating/cultural climate from an outsider's perspective.

This mirrors SM Goh's comment to that NTU student last year:

&gt;""Why should I be working for people who don’t feel they belong over here?""

Excuse me, but when did they stop even *pretending* they're looking out for anyone but themselves?

If I may use an analogy

The only corporate entity that would survive a situation like that one that has established a monopoly. And our government has most certainly established a monopoly, and bankrupted the opposition, and now they claim that we shouldn't choose anyone but the sensationalist demagogues at PAP, who warn of terrible things to come if another party is elected to power.

As if the Singaporean population as a whole is too dim-witted to choose what is best for themselves through a *democratic* election (although that word is really just become a bit of a joke around here).

Meanwhile,000 a year. $S140,000 a year once they retire just seems ridiculous. And don't even get me started on our PM, SM, and MM's S$3.7 million.

And they have the **audacity** to ask why they should work hard for people that aren't happy with their work? I think S$3.7 million in taxpayer money is more than enough incentive to work hard. Who knows

MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC

On the White Paper on Population

Madam Speaker

While the report has some compelling arguments for the 6.9m population figure projected

I feel the time has come for us to find a better balance between economic growth and social cohesion and yes there will have to be tradeoffs of economic growth but I would rather trade some of these for a cohesive

Our past decade of rapid population growth has already created too many problems which need to be solved first before we take the next step. I call on the government to take a breather for five years, except for the higher income Singaporeans including foreigners who just recently decided to make Singapore their home. So I call for a breather in this quest of growing the population and focus on improving the lives of Singaporeans and achieve that promised Swiss Standard of living for most Singaporeans first before we plan our next growth trajectory.

Taking Care of the Singaporean Core
I have a big issue with the number of PRs and new citizens we are planning to add to our population. I don't see the necessity to be as aggressive when the key consideration of the population growth is the economy. We have already added too many new citizens and PRs and need time for integration and social cohesion to happen. Looking at history, we grew the numbers from 2.3m in 1980 to 2.7m in 1990, 3.3m in the year 2000 and then to 3.8m last year. So in the last decade we added more than 1m to the resident population, and the in last 25 years, which is close to 1 generation of Singaporeans, we have added another close to 50% more to our resident population. I believe this must be the fastest rate of population growth in the world and I feel this is just too much for us to comfortably go back and build a national identity and social cohesion which was progressing very well till the 1990s. Adding another 500,000 to 800

If it is economic growth we want then let's just adopt the Dubai model of a transient workforce which will give us a lot more flexibility to manage numbers in the longer term. On PRs
- Far too many PR boys who skip NS when they turn 18. After enjoying the privileges they have a choice of not doing NS and then leave the country. I believe only around 30% of all PR boys do NS today. Well
- PR children study at their International system schools sticking to their home cultures.
- PRs can buy HDB flats from the open market driving prices of HDB flats too high.

So I urge the government to reduce the number of projected new PRs and citizens just to the population replacement levels and be more selective and differentiate their privileges from citizens. I have a few suggestions for the government to consider;

• The government in the past couple of years has tried to draw the distinction between PRs and citizens by increasing school fees and healthcare fees for them. But I wonder would it not have been better to instead partially subsidize these same fees for Singapore citizens? So do it the other way round

• PR children must be made do national service - it should no longer be a choice and we should make it an offence if they don’t do it. We should not grant PRs to families who don’t commit their sons to National Service.

• HDB - if a PR buys a HDB flat from the open market

• Children of PRs should be made to study in our national schools so that we increase the chance of integrating them at the next generation.

• On the employment front

• Reconsider the dependents policy - I have come across a number of cases where our targeted one child from China brings in 2 parents who then bring 2 parents each as their dependents - Net is that we gain one young one child who we brought in for our future but also inherited 6 older people - making our ageing population issue worse not better.

I feel the differentiated privileges will separate the genuine ones from those who are here for a ride. We should grant PRs to those who are most likely going to take up citizenships so these differentiated privileges should not stifle our plans to attract quality PRs and new citizens.

This brings me to the point of how many Singaporeans are feeling about the presence of such huge numbers of new citizens

Just last week I had a dialogue session with my private estates residents and one of my residents complained that a new citizens recently bought a landed property in this old estate and was building a 3 and a half storey towering house. Well the, I spoke with him during the tea session I found out that he was a new citizen formerly from China, just gained his citizenship and bought not 1 but 3 landed properties in Kebun Baru alone. I was surprised and saddened because many Singaporeans cannot afford to do the same, and this new citizen, no matter how he may have made his wealth is able to do so.

Many young Singaporeans I talk to, including professionals to easily gain employment passes degraded or depressed wage levels of many Singaporeans, not just the lower income Singaporeans. I remember when I started work in 1985, my salary was $1900 as an entry level engineer. After a few years I could afford a house and a car. Today, 28 years later, an entry level engineer in Singapore earns $2600, just $700 more than what I earned when I started. The mathematics is very simple, the cost of owning a HDB flat is did not just go up by 37% since 1985.

Finally, and are already paying a high price for that mistake.

In my speech in this house in 2008 during the committee of supply debate on the population I urged the government to abandon the ""the instant tree mentality"" in trying to grow the population in response to the declining birth rates. At that time, no one really knows. Please abandon this 'instant tree"" mentality as we cannot afford to make Singaporeans lives more difficult as a result. I rather we err on the side of caution when it comes to growing our population. We cannot keep paying a high price for planning misjudgements.

In Conclusion, give them a better quality of life and show them that any future growth of population will not create similar social and cost of living problems. At this stage many Singaporeans from all walks of life don't have the confidence that we can handle another steep growth of the population, so let's not push it. I would like all of us, including the government to spend the time creating and environment that gives us confidence in our future and one where our young can see a sense of hope of opportunity and if we fail to instil a sense of hope and opportunity for our future generations, we will not be able to root them here and build a strong national identity and a strong nation. This is what building a strong Singapore core should entail. So let's delay all plans for further population growth for now.",,False,t5_2qh8c,True

I thought that before I leave you're lovely country at the end of the month,comment and let's get this discussion going :). I was thinking July 23rd (Saturday Night after 6-7pm), what do you guys and gals think?  
  
The options so far:   

[Wala Wala @ Holland Village](http://www.worldsbestbars.com/wala-wala-cafe-bar-in-singapore.htm)  
[Crazy Elephant @ Clarke Quay](http://www.crazyelephant.com/aboutus.html)  
[Se7en Inch @ Clarke Quay](http://www.timeoutsingapore.com/clubs/venues/bars/se7en1nch)  
btw se7en inch is not as sleazy as that article makes it out to be....disappointingly :p  
  
**Update 1**: Seems to be a lot of love for Holland Village right now with 2 bars named
  
**Update 2**: Alright so far it looks like more people are into Holland Village for a meetup. It's a little more relaxed and doesn't have as much of a tourist trap feel. Plus it'll be good busy not mad rush busy like i'm assuming Clarke Quay will be. The bars will probably alternate between Baden and Wala Wala. They are [5 minutes apart on the same road](http://maps.google.com.sg/maps?saddr=31+Lorong+Mambong,103.794421&amp;spn=0.001456,0.002642&amp;sll=1.31175,103.794405&amp;sspn=0.001456,0.002642&amp;geocode=FbEDFAAd7MYvBikRgeiVaxraMTH9M6ZJgog47g%3BFZgEFAAdJscvBiGB7WF_My68Bg&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=w&amp;z=19) so it's a non issue. Baden is a bit of a quieter less expensive hangout joint, and wala wala has higher prices overall but also provides for a second level with a live band. What's the general preference? Post comments. For the record i'd ideally like to start at baden and abuse their happy hour and then see where the rowdy reddit crowd will want to go afterwards. Thoughts?  
  
**FINAL UPDATE:** Hey guys. So it's decided that this shindig is going down at Holland Village. For your convenience,0.010568&amp;sll=1.308793,103.792262&amp;sspn=0.005824,0.010568&amp;geocode=FdrzEwAda7IvBiElGrU3lFMJew%3BFYIEFAAdyMYvBilDkAyUaxraMTHsMM73UF_Pzw&amp;gl=sg&amp;mra=ls&amp;dirflg=r&amp;ttype=now&amp;noexp=0&amp;noal=0&amp;sort=def&amp;z=17&amp;start=0) from the Buona Vista MRT station to The Baden and Wala Wala Cafe.

Here is a typical exchange when entering a taxi.

Me: Hello Uncle

Uncle: Huh? *Actually

Me: Can I go to Hougang please?

Uncle: AHH? Havelock?

Me: HOW-GUNG..HOW-GUNG HOW-GUNG.

Uncle: Ok

This happens in nearly every taxi I enter

Nearly every time I go to a Kopitiam

Me: Can I have one bubur pulut hitam?

Lady: AHH?

Me: Can I have one Bu-bur-pu-lut-hi-tam?

Lady: GHSGJHSGHJSG AH?

Me: Sure

*As she is pouring it into the bowl*

Me: Can I have extra coconut cream?

Lady: AHH? 

Me: Extra coconut cream please

Lady: Extra Ahh? *Dips ladle in to get extra juice from the pot of bubur pulut hitam and makes the dish super watered down.*

She then pours one little spoon of cream on top, talking to this woman at this point would just further frustrate me and probably land me on Stomp.

Another example at the Kopitiam...a different stall. I'm ordering food and I ask the man if the curry is Chicken. ""Yes yes chicken yes."" I ask, which does nothing to answer my question.

Ok, I don't speak like I have shit in my mouth, aside from ""American,"" I have no crazy accent. I'm speaking clearly, and loud enough for normal people to hear. What the fuck is so different that I keep running into these same problems with people at hawker stands and in taxis? I'm paying to get food, or to use a service, and I would like to receive that food or service a specific way, these people make it so difficult

Excuse me if this makes me sound like an asshole

Greetings all. 

Everyone's favourite Singaporean microbrewery, 12th January**. It costs **$40 for all-u-can-drink** (Bargain! Where else in Singapore can you find such a deal?), and happens from **6pm till 12mn**, or whenever we get thrown out. They usually have four types of beer on tap.

So bring your drinking hats, and if any of us feel energetic enough we might have a little /r/singapore pool tourny. Winner gets bragging rights, and a beer (which you already paid for).

Where:

[Gallery of Pics]

Donated Blood today
wanted to share how it went.

I donated at 
  
Bloodbank @ Health Sciences Authority (HSA)

  Its close to Outram Park MRT Station

**[List of places to donate](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/wheretodonate.html?direct=1)**

You can choose to donate 

* whole blood (regular donation) **OR**
* platelets and plasma ([apheresis](http://www.hsa.gov.sg/publish/hsaportal/en/health_services/blood_donation/what_to_donate/apheresis.html))

Apheresis is recommended for non-first timers in my opinion.

Apheresis requires large veins that will not collapse for the hour long procedure.

I tried once but it collapsed halfway. They told me to try again in 2 years.

**Highly recommended to make an appointment before going down**

-Its pretty fast

-You get placed in a priority line

Once inside

1. Fill up Questionnaire

2. Wait to be called for the doctor to take your blood pressure

3. Next station

4. Enter the area with the chairs, though it seems that they use similar lines to make donors feel at ease, better than nothing though.

5. Vein check, the actual process itself.

6. Wait for blood to be drawn out

The actual process itself is very much shorter than the form-filling and waiting. Pretty fast

During the process itself the staff will hand you a food voucher
and some iron tablets to replenish your iron supply.

**If you visit in between 11.30 and 1.30pm**

It is considered lunchtime and a full meal will be redeemed using the voucher.
[**Menu for that day**](http://imgur.com/PQBHX)

Other times would just be a snack.

I also received a pretty thick notebook. Hardcover and bound pretty nicely. Came in a plastic cover shaped like a blood bag and a sticker/decal that mimicked a blood bag label.

On top of that there was also an extra gift because of donating during my birthday month. It was an handheld electric fan with a pretty cute and cool function

The room rent we have paid for is about 1.7k SGD. However

It's a tad steep but its the number 1 rated place on TripAdvisor and we were looking forward to splurging a bit on our annual holiday but will have to give it up now :( we just want to try and see if someone we know can enjoy it instead.

Please do reply in case you know anyone who is keen.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

LOL my first scumbag hat!

I am just a bit hectic this am  doing network stuff and I need to stay off reddit!

Send me your needs I promise to do my best guys...

- Vijjer - PC
- Kubrick - PC and Monitor
- Guyz - PC

Happy New Year!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATE - Monday 1/23 @ 1pm

4pm Hardware Dump off is scheduled for Raffles Place - right in the middle of the courtyard where the 2 MRT stations exit.

I am the tall

email me if you can make it!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
UPDATE - Monday 1/23 @ 430pm

Success!  Met up with a few tech hungry redditors and delivered the goods.  If any of you are still out there email me

Nice meeting you guys!  

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE - Tuesday 1/24 @ 12 

Late start this morning.  I am eating way too much on this trip and not sleeping!  I am back in the office today and looking to set up a 5pm meetup.  Same place

If you guys are around

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE - Tuesday @ 5

The pile is thinning out!  This is great

I still need to coordinate with the following:

nikuhiro
catofcanal
kubrick
wontoncookie
galaxyhiker - bro I got a monitor for ya!

I am in tomorrow.  If I cant get it done before I leave I may hand the project off to the might Redditor named ""numbandnumber"".  He has volunteered to adopt all the old gear and distribute it out to worthy causes around the City.

This has been fun - great to meet you all.  Thanks for the Oranges MedStudent they were super tasty.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE Wednesday - I dont even know the date anymore.... :D

Meetup in Raffles Place Courtyard in about 30 mins.  Dropping off one last batch.  Anybody around?  I have a couple of giant Dell towers that are pretty much stripped but would make a good case-mod project.

email - pm - post - scream out your window - etc etc!  I will respond if still alive.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

UPDATE almost Thursday...I think??? (who cares - clocks mean nothing to me anymore) 

At the airport sippin a jack &amp; coke in the most pimped out airport lounge i ever done seen.  This is ridiculous!  Have you ever been to LAX?  You can get mugged IN THE AIRPORT!  Changi is like a fancy hotel.

It has been a lot of fun meeting all of you.  I had a very hectic

There are still a few bits and pieces of gear remaining at my office.  I have set the stuff aside and will be coordinating the numbandnumber to pick up and distribute as he sees fit.  He is an honorable gentleman and he will do the right thing.  Very sorry if i missed any of you.  PM me and I will do my best to stoke you out.

Take care everyone.  Use those computers until they burn out and grind to a halt!  I expect your REDDIT posts to increase by at least 45% due to the increased processing power.

Come on out to California and look me up!  (seriously)

So, but we think that **Bar Bar Black Sheep** on Robertson Quay (the location of the August meetup) would be a great location, for a number of reasons which will be explained in due time.~~ We have booked an outside table for 20 people in **Brewerkz** in Clarke Quay!

Secondly, fear not you beautiful, socially awkward reddiporeans out there for **we don't really care if you decided to wear a costume or not**. Seriously. First and foremost, this is a meetup - costumes are secondary. The point is to come along, meet a bunch of redditors, share stories, have some fun, drink and be merry as much or as little as you like

Of course, do! Personally, I'd love to see hoobaga in a giant penguin costume *(hint, hint)* but it's up to you. No pressure, no worries.

We have a few ideas for Hallowe'en games but need to work out a few issues first. I had the idea of playing [apple bobbing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_bobbing) and then thought we could make it better and a bit more local by turning it into... wait for it... DURIAN BOBBING!

How about pumpkin carving? If anyone knows where we could get decent-sized pumpkins

Lastly

~~ As I said

Give us your thoughts

does anyone know if landlords are allowed to enter condo's without asking first? i didn't see it in the contract but this guy is being a complete jerk and i think he comes in to my place at LEAST once a week.

2 days ago i even found crumbs all over my kitchen table that I know i didn't leave (i'm very neat).

i confronted him about this and he just says he's allowed to do anything he wants since it's his property

when i first met him he was so nice. now he is a fucking absolute nightmare. here are some problems i need to deal with:

* he told me that the airconditioner wasn't working before i moved in and would take $100 off my monthly rent. i agreed. now he told me that i will be responsible to fix the air conditioner or I won't get my security deposit.
* my front door has some scratches on it and he said I will need to pay to paint it. i have no idea who scratched it... am I responsible for this? it could have been anyone in the building.
* he lives on the same floor as me and always makes loud spitting noises and spits in the hallway. several people have asked him to stop and someone even posted a note in the hallway asking ""whoever is spitting please stop"". the next day there was spit on that note.
* constantly screaming at night in chinese and having loud phone conversations past midnight

Yes, there's loads of room for us, they have a decent selection of beer (including Jungle Beer!), the beer gets cheaper after 11 o'clock, Clarke Quay bridge is nearby for further late-night revelries and there's lots of taxis nearby for getting home around 4 am or whenever.

There's a damn good chance I'm getting relocated to Singapore in the next month or two with my company. I'm a 27 year old white guy originally from California

I've perused the sidebar quite a bit, I'd be super happy, and may even buy you a beer once I get into town!

1. Living? Where do you recommend? My offices are located near the corner of Telok Ayer and Cross St (I work in Finance, our downtown area is lacking in the nightlife department, so I'd like to live somewhere that has a decent bar scene, but not far from work. My budget would be up to 1,100 SGD per month. Is it feasible to live on my own?

2. Speaking of nightlife, except for clubbing.

3. How much is a pint of beer? Google is telling me I'll need to sacrifice my first-born son and mortgage his soul to buy rounds at the bar. Is this true? Am I going to go broke buying shots for girls at the bar?

4. How much of the country speaks English? What's the native tongue? I speak with Singaporeans daily

Last night at around 1.30am I [23f] had an argument with my dad - who is extremely hot-headed and can get violent when things don't go his way. So things got heated last night. He threw a ceramic bowl at me

My mother then pushed me into my room and asked me to lock the door while my father went into the store room to get the vacuum cleaner pipe and threatened to hit me with it. He later went out and only came back home late afternoon today. When my mum heard he was coming home

He told my mum he will hit me again if he sees me. I'm home now and he isn't due to work. He only comes back home once or twice a week because of work

It's not the first time he's physical. In the past when I was younger

I'm very tempted to have him charged by the police. He's not only physical with me but also with his employees. But everyone in the family, what will happen?

I don't know how to proceed now - how to face him and continue living with him and if I should report him to the police. 

This is a throwaway account.

**EDIT, showing remorse. I guess I feel better but still emotionally hurt that he hit me.

1303803370.0,gxmas,Which maid to choose? by Ming Lee Lim ,jitaotapout,19,1,3,"I need your urgent advice about employing a maid. As a busy mother
 
My maid is from Profits Agency Pte (PAP) and she has worked for me for a long time. Her mother worked for my parents and did an excellent job, and is making lots of mistakes.
 
For example:

1)     She flooded my kitchen –  she told me that the drain pipe has blocked (she was supposed to clear it once a month but didn’t). Then she assured me that it is very rare and won’t happen again in the near future. Guess what? It flooded again within a year!

2)     She didn’t close a window and my terrier dog escaped. I was so worried cos he is dangerous and could bite lots of people. After the incident

3)     Without consulting me, make a lot of noise and rest on my bed. I think they even tried to seduce my husband. It stopped feeling like my home, more like a cheap hotel, and I don’t always want to come back at the end of the day.

4)     When she first came to work for me
 
Even though my maid has worked for me for many years and I value what she has done in the past, and Singapore isn’t big enough for more than one good maid agency, so I should not trust their competitors.
 
I have to decide whether to renew my maid’s 5-year employment contract. When we discussed this she said that she is now part of a team, she only seemed interested in her days-off and visiting Universal Studios. When she couldn't answer my questions she stomped her foot and exclaimed, ""I don't know what to say!"" But I am still expected to pay her a high salary.
 
Now there happen to be a few other maid agencies - Workhard Pte (WP), genuine and intelligent. They are keen to work, willing to assist me and have a good attitude. I know that they may take a bit of time to learn how everything works, but frankly I am inclined to give them a chance.
 
People say that the devil you know is better than one you don’t. But I feel that I can’t tahan my current maid anymore. Do you think I should sack my current maid and try out a new one? Appreciate your advice.

Then in the evening I get a call saying that the new tenant is not interested in our stuff (because she assumes I'm gonna just throw it out as I don't have space for it in my new flat), a microwave, a couch , a computer desk, a coffee table and a bedside table). I was like that's ridiculous.....It's worth like 1K+. 

Then she's really shows her teeth....she's like 'Ohhh I've had to do so much work here and this is broken and that was broken so you give me your stuff for this much or you come and do all the repair/painting work yourself.' and she's basically telling me that I've destroyed her house and I need to repair the whole thing.  

Now she's holding my deposit as well as my stuff hostage and saying that everything in the house needs to be changed/repaired.......what the hell do I do? Can I go to the police or some sort of consumer court?

My understanding is that pretty much everyone (except for maybe some older people or recent migrants/foreign workers) can speak English fluently

Do you speak English or other languages most of the time with your friends? At work? Out and about?

Does this change depending on whether the person is younger/older/the same age as you? (e.g. if you're talking to an elderly person who might not have had much schooling in English)

If you're talking to another person of the same race that you do not know (e.g. a stranger on the bus)

How about in the home environment? Do your parents speak the same language with you that they spoke with their parents? If not

Do you ever get into situations with people where you don't have any languages in common?

Bonus question for Chinese Singaporeans - can you only speak Mandarin

So we've decided to open to all of glorious r/Singapore. The date would be the 7th of November (this year of course) as it's a public holiday. 

 A single trip there should cost about $3, find someone to rent a tandem bike with you! Estimated cost for bicycle rental is about $8-12 for a full day, for a good/decent bike. However you can probably rent them from as low as $2 a day. Do remember to ask for a bike lock when renting the bicycle. 

A rough plan for the day is as follows: Bring lunch and water with you


After which we can continue cycling around the island and see quarries/temples/wildboars or whatever. Leave the island at  6pm

Things to bring:

* $$

* Snacks

* Mosquito Repellant (as strong as you can get)

* A hat and or shades ~~and a tailored Italian suit~~

* Poncho/Umbrella ... Just in case.

* Your favorite sun screen

* Camera! (You won't regret this)

* OPTIONAL: A change of clothes

* Whatever else you think you may need


**A piece of advice: Sometimes on ubin your cellphone will pick up the Malaysian telco signal instead of the Singapore one. So please switch off your mobile internet/3G when you're on the island to avoid being ass-raped by your telco.** 


Pulau ubin is mainland Singapore's hardcore cousin.. so don't expect fairies and butterflies (ok

I'll finalize the details by the end of the week. But expect the current date and time to be stuck to. Think about it! 



If you have questions just post below or PM me. If you want my number you can PM me too. My name's Tim. 

**LATEST UPDATE: This is confirmed to be on the 7th November. If you're driving/taking a cab, we'll have to take bus 2 from tanah merah bus stop and stop at changi village terminal, then take a 5 minute walk to the Jetty. Remember to pack your lunch, we'll be eating on Noordin/Mamam Beach at Pulau Ubin. For those who have no idea who I am or how to find any of us at Tanah Merah, please PM me and I'll get back to you with my number, as well as Darren's number (hope you don't mind), in case I fail to pick up my phone (he's the unofficial co-organizer).**
