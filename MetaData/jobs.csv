1359679885.0,17ny7s,If I knew over a year ago what I know now - my advice for job seekers,lipgloss_addict,409,41,75,"The last 18 months of job searching have been horrific for me. I've spent almost 20 years in IT

Here goes :

1. It's a numbers game, it's what everyone else is doing. Hone in on what you want, or where you want to do it, and drill down via various methods to find what you want. Focus your energy this way.

2. Linkedin is your friend.  This falls under a couple of topics:
   a.  Join groups specific to your field, since Linkedin is for building a professional network and job hunting.
   b. Watch status updates for contacts on your phone. If someone lists a job (which is how I found mine), and second, the company they left has an opening.  Use this to your advantage.
   c. If you found a job you want (by narrowing your focus)

3. Volunteer, my volunteer work came up. This means something for recruiters. IF you are out of work, hiring managers want to know what you did with your time off.  Fill it.  Second, I used my volunteer work to round out my skill set, and got real world, practical experience that ultimately led me to be able  to move into a new role in my new position.

4. Join groups that have to do with what you want. Find them on meetup, even if you are a noob. People will think of you when positions open up.

5. Help other people whenever you can. It will make you feel better about this whole process

6. Never give up. This process was horrific, because I knew my desperation had to be showing, and I'm sure it was.  A break can do wonders, but do it with an end point in mind  because as heartless as it sounds, no one was going to get me a job but me.  Move forward even though at times its painful.

Ok

1373853968.0,1ib8x4,I used to work in HR and reviewed thousands of résumés. Here are my tips based on that experience (which involved a lot of me getting pissed off at really bad résumés). Happy to answer questions.,robertgfthomas,426,64,114,"*(My experience is entirely in the US; other regions may have different preferences. This advice is geared towards those who don't have years of full-time experience and are applying to entry-level-ish positions

*Also, and get opinions from other people.)*

**1. Your résumé must be one page.**

There are CVs (curricula vitae) and there are résumés. A CV can be however long it needs to be: its purpose is to tell an employer pretty much everything about you and your work history. If an employer wants a CV

A résumé is like a one-page magazine ad. Its purpose isn't to tell everything about you — it's to make you stand out from everyone else. It will be glanced at for 3-10 seconds

It's made even more difficult by how a résumé is *unlike* a magazine ad: instead of being printed in color and sandwiched by interesting articles

**2. Layout's really freaking important.**

Each item should have no more than 3 lines of descriptive info below it, or one three-line paragraph. (3 lines is a *maximum*, not a recommended amount.)

Your résumé should be only black and white/grayscale. It will be printed out along with several hundred other résumés using a crappy black-and-white office printer. The colors will appear as gray

Many web-safe and/or sans-serif fonts (like Arial) don't read well.

Balance your blank space. Too little and you have a wall of text that will never get read. Too much and you look like you have no experience and/or no idea what you're doing. Have 1"" margins on all sides

For each work/education experience, job date, job location.

**3. Don't include any info that goes without saying.**

You list ""bank teller"" as one of your job experiences. That's great! You don't need to explain on the résumé what your duties were — unless they were something beyond what a normal person would expect a bank teller to do (you led a major marketing campaign for your bank in your town that increased revenue by $50K) or accomplish (you won Employee of the Year).

Ditto for the vast majority of retail

**Also**

**4. You don't need an ""Objective"".**

Everyone's objective is the same: ""to get a job"". Rephrase that however you will, and will just take up valuable space.

**5. If a verb doesn't describe a concrete action

*Leveraged, managed, coordinated, produced, brainstormed*... These are all ""fluff"". They rarely add any meaning to your résumé and detract from its read-at-a-glance-ability. *Co-authored, lectured, built, taught*

For example

*Managed company's Salesforce database and organized and maintained data
Produced high-quality vector graphics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator, and Javascript*

...just write:

* CRM software: Salesforce

* Vector graphic design: Adobe Photoshop/Illustrator

* Static web design: HTML

**6. ""Qualifications"" should be mostly proper nouns.**

Certifications you've earned

*Hardworking

*Mathematically and technologically-savvy*

*Friendly and outgoing personality*

**7. Your grammar

Some other HR people with whom I worked didn't consider this to be so important. Every single time they hired someone whose résumé didn't have immaculate language

Having perfect language conveys to the reviewer that you're smart

1370390462.0,1forak,"One full year of unemployment, 717 applications, and crying myself to sleep every night- how I finally got the jobs + tips + statistics",NY1227,313,76

Me: M.S in education 4.0

Basically

**Websites I applied to:** Linkedin.com, careerbuilder.com, local help wanted site, indeed.com, craigslist.org, snagajob.com, specific company websites I was interested in using a bookmark folder

**Number of applications:** 717

**Number of interviews:** 7

**Ways I got the interviews:** blindly applying online (4)

**Number of job offers I received**: 2 simultaneously- both were the positions found through networking.

**Things I did**: Looked at meetup.com for networking groups in my area, purchased linkedin premium (worth the free trial to send inmails and express you interest via another route), checked above sites literally multiple times a day, tailored resumes and cover letters *usually* (ironically, 2 of my 7 interviews were from generic cover letters and resumes, go figure).

I love the chrome extension boomerang- it allowed me to write emails and inquiries and then send them the following morning at whatever time I wanted- I always chose 8:28- giving them time to clear their inbox but making me look eager.

**How I eventually got the jobs**: Both of my offers occurred today and they were the only 2 times I ever successfully networked. The worst part in job hunting is hearing NETWORK! I didn't feel like I had a network. Nobody knew anyone. Everyone loved to shout the word network at me, I began literally mentioning my job search to anyone that would listen, in any context that was even a little remotely appropriate. At my Aunt's 50th birthday? Anyone who asks me how I'm doing I'd respond with ""good, still looking for a job"" - if they gave *any* opening like ""how is it going?"" and / or ""what are you looking for"" I immediately told them the types of jobs I was seeking. **My biggest piece of advice is when people ask what you're looking for, do not say 'anything.' It doesn't give people a chance to think about who they might know. Try to be vague without sounding vague. For example, I said I'd love a desk position at someplace like a college, or a doctors office, I caught my first break at a funeral. I was chatting with a grieving relative of a friend and dropped this line- he put me in touch with someone he knew

My second big piece of advice, but I often feel like I annoy people with my emails and calls. I eventually had to suck it up. You HAVE to call and check on your applications, you HAVE to follow up with more emails- it's the reality. Remember, you're not their priority. They have work and things going on - what is a big deal to you (finding a job at their company) is just another day in their life for them. Be prepared to step outside your comfort zone. I did not check up on all 717 jobs via phone, but only the ones where I felt like I was a particularly good fit.

Once you get the interview

I literally went to bed in tears almost every night. It seemed like everyone had a job but me. I was jealous of people on this subreddit making posts like this- because they had something I didn't. It's so hard to not know when your big break is coming- but you won't be unemployed forever. It's not a reality. One day , and what works for one person may not work for another. This economy sucks, being unemployed sucks, and writing cover letters and resumes for hours on end is the worst. I sincerely wish everyone Good luck, and I hope this helped even one person.

So far since May

* 2 companies called and canceled my interview the day before because they filled the position. 

I think this is rude. Sure

* I had a company schedule a phone interview with me. They gave me a 3 hour time frame and then never called. I e-mailed them

I thought this was extremely rude. I sat around for 3 hours waiting for that damn call. I hate phone interviews more than face to face interviews because you have to represent yourself in a different way and I find that to be highly stressful. It still ticks me off that they wasted my time and didn't even bother to call and inform me before or during the time allotted for the phone interview to tell me the position was filled.

and finally...

* I got a call back yesterday for a job I applied for. She did some basic screening questions with me. Then she announced that I would have an interview today. Yes, I told her that I couldn't come in today or tomorrow as I was going to be out of town, but that I would be available all next week starting on Monday. There was silence for a second, she sighed and very bitchly said ""Well.. this is the ONLY day you can interview for this position.. so you need to decide if you want a shot at this position or if you want to go on a vacation.""   I was stunned and instantly pissed off.  When I applied for this position, I made a note somewhere on my application stating there are certain days in which I cannot interview. So clearly, she didn't bother reading the whole thing or she didn't care. 

Anyway, I don't want to work with a company where they have someone as rude and bitchy as you recruiting people. And for your information, I am not going on vacation, I am going to see my Grandpa who is dying from Parkinsons."" And then I hung up on her. 

I realize I should have taken the high road on the last one

What I found was shocking.  I had many phone interviews, but I still only had one on-site interview, which went terribly.

Finally, so I began to ask old labmates and my old bosses at a particular top company what kinds of jobs were available.  I passed my resume onto them, and within a week, I had a hiring manager e-mail me for an *on-site* interview.  Not even a phone screen.  When I get on-site, my interviews consisted of either of very chummy people explaining how the weather was so great, or alumni from my school asking how so-and-so is.  There were very few technical questions.  It was as if an invisible hand was guiding me to this position, although I was no more qualified for it than previous countless jobs I had applied for at other companies.  The real kicker was that the salary they offered was about 20% higher than what I could have hoped for at another company.

I am still shocked at how much my network helped me land a job.  I honestly thought my qualifications would speak for themselves.  The whole process has made me sad.

However, I realized that the job market was going to be a little bit harder to get into than that, so I started to work harder. I began getting near-straight A's, I became vice president of my university newspaper, I got a high profile internship in the federal government. 

At the tail end of this internship in 2011 I began applying for jobs but received nothing, thinking that might give me the edge to get me a job where my basic duty would be answering phones and typing reports. However, at the conclusion of this degree, I still did not receive a single offer for a job interview.

I ended up going to work in China, I've been back applying to jobs in North America again, still nothing.

2. I attended a resume building workshop and re-did mine. The main thing was to condense a 2 page resume into one jam packed with all the info. In a nutshell: white space on a resume is dead space. Fill it!

3. At the top of my resume I had 3 lines that I would edit slightly for every new job position I'd apply for. Including a title

4. started mailing Thank You cards by snail mail. I would thank the person who interviewed me
In fact, I mailed the thank you card to the HR lady instead of the interviewers. I mailed it before I accepted the offer (was waiting to hear back from other companies so I kept them waiting a week). After I accepted, she got me a higher offer without me even asking for more money. I attribute this to the card I sent.

5. Changed the way I did phone interviews. I prepared canned answers for the usual questions one gets
http://www.pongoresume.com/articleTopics/29/interviews.cfm

6. Utilize cover letters. My cover letter has the same header and fonts as my resume. First paragraph is about what I'm applying for, link to my reel, and request to prove myself worthy.

7. Before an interview I would spend 1-3 hours researching the company, press releases. And if I knew who would be interviewing me, research the people them selves. LinkedIn is a great resource for that.

8. Network. 
 - LinkedIn. If you have a decent LinkedIn network you can see if you know anyone at companies you're interested in. If you don't you can still get introduced to them by people you do know.
 -  Strangers. I would approach strangers
 - Attend job fairs
 - Utilize your school's job placement department.
 - Basically try and use every resource you can think of at your disposal to get the scoop about jobs in your area

Edit: added 6-7.
Edit 2: added 8

I am an engineer with a master’s degree. And in this economy it is hard to find a job. Since r/jobs has helped me out a lot


**Before applying for jobs.**

* Lock up your social networking sites except LinkedIn (facebook
* Update your  LinkedIn. Open this to the public.
* Update your resume.
* Schedule an hour a day for job application until you get an offer.


**During job application**

* Mass application kind of works. I applied for 168 jobs on a Saturday. This took 10 hours. 
I received 3 phone interviews out of which were one of the companies I recently got hired into.
* Be honest 
* Writing cover letters suck but a customized one for each company works.
* Resume should NOT contain pictures
* Resume SHOULD contain your technical skills, your address, certifications, and phone number.
* When applying for jobs in your field
* Make sure your spelling and grammar are perfect. NO COMPROMISE.  
* Use auto form filler like RoboForm to make your life easier.


**Phone interview**

* When scheduling a phone interview
* Make sure your charge up your cellphone battery. (I lost an opportunity when my cellphone battery died DURING an interview)
* Address the interviewer by name.
* Be prepared to describe your current situation
* Ask at least 4 questions relating to the job. 
* Ask what the next steps are. 


**During an actual interview.**
 
* Dress and look smart. First impressions are absolutely important.
* Be relaxed and provide the interviewer with your resume and a visual resume (google it).
* Provide the resumes in a folder with your name labeled to it.
* Again be prepared to describe what you are looking for and what you can do for the company based on the job description.
* Give firm handshakes.
* Always be honest and confident while answering questions. If you do not know a something
* Always remember to get their business card.
* Send a thank you email within 8 hours of the interview.


**Post interview**

* If you do not hear back from them in a week’s time


Waiting is part of the game. I had to wait for about 3 months before I received an offer.
Hope this helps. Good Luck on your search. If you have tips I may have missed

**1)  If you think you don't have a job right now, research the companies that you apply to.  Research companies you want to apply to that aren't hiring yet.  Set up a Linked In profile and see who you know that's connected to any jobs and ask them for ideas.  Go to networking events, mixers, whatever.  Customize cover letters for every application.  If you're done with your search and on reddit by noon, you're doing it wrong.  That being said, don't burn yourself out either.  It's ok to take weekends off or sleep in.  If you're in a negative cycle, take some time to yourself to get in a better state of mind before you dive back in.  

**2)  But it's been FOUR MONTHS!**  Job searches take time and patience, know this by now, so don't be afraid that your resume is now ""stale"".  And keep that in mind when you get discouraged or think that certain strategies aren't paying off.  These things take a long time.  During the mid-2000s, I read a study that said that for every $10,000 in annual salary you want, your job search will take a month.  Meaning it would take an average of 4 months (during the biggest economic boom since the end of WW2) to find a job that pays $40,000/year.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess it takes longer than that now.

**3)  Network your butt off.**  Seriously, just so long as you do it.  The single greatest asset you can have in a job search is someone who will vouch for you.  The more people you know, the better your chances are.  Find groups in your area that cater to your field and go to every meeting you can.  If there's more than one, join them all.  Make it your goal to leave every meeting with at least 5 business cards from people you didn't know before.  Call or email all of them, make dates for coffee or lunch or an in depth phone conversation.  Ask questions.

**4)  Know the difference between networking and begging.**  Despite how you may feel, experience, advice, constructive criticism and a network of other people you might want to know.  Ask about those things; tell them you're just trying to learn and develop yourself.  And have a perspective or a specific area of interest to ask them about.  Even if you have no idea what sort of job you want, ask them about whatever industry and position they're in as if that's the exact job you want.  Nobody will ever know if you're lying.  And remember that flattery, while totally shameless, is also incredibly effective.

**5)  Just because you aren't STEM, that's an awful idea.  Education is great, and if you can get it, I encourage it, but just because you have a philosophy degree and like using the internet, doesn't mean you'll enjoy being a database architect, or be able to find a job as one.  If your life's dream is to work with computers all day, don't sign up for 4 years of school and a mountain of expenses because some programmer on a web forum told you he makes six figures and nobody at his office understands how to do his job

**6)  Appearance and attitude count.**  Dress the part and be pleasant.  It's astonishing how many people still don't understand this.  If you're going into an office building for an interview, aren't you?  I mean, this is the first interview you've had in 2 months and the pay is $10,000 a year more than you'd need to cover your bills....shouldn't that be exciting enough to elicit the occasional smile.  

**7) You aren't special (on paper.)**  I see a lot of posts asking ""how do I convey in my cover letter that I'm the type of person who does X?""  The honest answer is you probably can't.  When reading applications and resumes, but this is where networking can really help.  Simply saying you're a hard worker doesn't count for much, but if Shelly from Accounts Receivable says ""I know a guy who'd be great for this, he's a hard working dude"" you may find yourself getting a phone call.

This is a bit long

I was listening to a report on NPR where they looked into the rampant unemployment.  They interviewed a man who said that *everyone* on his street was unemployed.

I started thinking about how that entire neighborhood could save itself

It then occurred to me that in many ways

So what if all us unemployed/underemployed redditors pooled our resources and skills and tried to start some sort of business?

In this day and age we all can pretty much agree that offices and face-to-face communication are not at all necessary for a business.  We could all (potentially) play vital roles from wherever we call home.

I'm an attorney

If we all are willing to do some work for free (I know I am)

So how about it folks?  What skills do you have that you could contribute?  Does anyone have an idea of what services we could perform or what products we could create?

I'm certain that there are dozens

I guarantee that among us there are underemployed web-designers, who could give us a very respectable and professional web presence.  I also guarantee that the *employed* reddit community would likely help us in our endeavors, buying any goods or services we could reliably offer.

I think we have a real opportunity to be the first online community to do what *""real""* communities have done in the past... pool resources based on nothing but common geography.  Except that our common geography exists only in cyberspace (excuse the 90's terminology).

So please, tell us all what your skills are, and share any ideas you might have.

I immediately began applying to every relevant position I saw, and needed to try a new approach. All of the career advice blogs and websites said networking is key to finding your career. Yes, of course networking is important… but how the hell do you begin to network when you don’t know anyone in your career field? I started by telling everyone that I was looking for a job. Everyone. Every family member, friend, cashier, bar tender, and waitress I encountered found out that I was looking for a job. It started to surprise me how often someone would say that they know someone with a relevant career as to which I was searching for. 

A cashier at my local grocery store had a cousin which worked as a hiring manager for a regional hospital. The cashier gave me their contact information, and sent it over. I was called in for an interview 3 days later, and was once again employed 2 weeks after that.


**My Advice:** Network by telling EVERYONE you are looking for a job

**Edit:** I'll clarify a little that I am certainly not calling myself a professional at job searching. I simply changed my approach. I originally started by scouring Monster, etc for new listings and sending my resume and realized that didn't work, so I went on to networking. I also believe my choice of resume had a great response. I decided to go with something a little more creative [(this one)](http://www.kukook.com/CVTemplates/Executive/tabid/97/ProdID/24/CatID/11/Executive_CV_1.aspx). Also created one using [this template](http://www.kukook.com/ResumeTemplates/EntryLevel/tabid/90/ProdID/26/CatID/1/Graphic_Design_Resume.aspx) but decided that might be a little too creative or 'artsy' for my position.",,False,,t5_2qhnd,,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1hz54x/after_16_months_of_unemployment_and_roughly_400/

6ish weeks ago

There is one specific company that I have several phone screens with. They all go well. This is over the span of a week. I get invited to go on site for 3 hours (during a work day) at this really amazing company. One you all interact with every day. It goes really well.

I get back to my office, and if any of my other interviews fail I'm totally screwed.

The next day I'm invited back to another round at said amazing company. At this point I haven't signed any termination papers, low, crappy, numb. The firing was really traumatic for me. 

I ask everyone I know if I should mention what happened. People who recruit, etc. Everyone says the same thing: don't volunteer the information. If you are explicitly asked, tell them.

Makes sense to me.

No one explicitly asks me if I'm still at the other company. I explain ""the reason I started looking for a new job is (insert why I wasn't happy)""

Interviews go well. I land a new job a day after getting fired, and am honest about all dates, and specify that I am currently self employed.

I start working there.

3 weeks in I am confronted by a manager that interviewed me at my second onsite (after I got fired). Manager somehow heard what happened at last gig. Said manager claims that I was not forthcoming and should not have beaten around the bush. Should have just explicitly laid it out. I apologize, and say I can provide dozens of references from the last company to corroborate what happened. Literally got fired because I was interviewing at the company I now work at. Didn't know what to do. Didn't want anyone to feel bad for me. 

Manager understands the position I was in. But still

Thinks about it. Decides to fire me.

Broken. 

What now? Do I tell every single person that interviews me what happened at both situations? Do I just tell the recruiters? What if they ask what I've been doing in between job 1 and now (since job 2 won't be on the resume, which is my priory salary? Job 1 or 2?

I work in advertising and know the best way to get your message across; limit the amount of words and make sure each word is “powerful”. This is where I needed to be creative.

**TOOL #1:TWITTER!**
You can only send 140 characters at one time
I opened up Twitter and copy and pasted each resume bullet point into the “What’s Happening?” box to see how many words I had used and reduced the words to fit into the 140 characters mark. Using this tool helped me re-word all of my bullet points and reduced my resume from 1.5 pages to 1 page with room to spare.
I continued to tweak my resume and knew I had hit the “golden resume” when I was contacted by a recruiter a day after I submitted my resume. 

**Timeline:** The resume process took me about a month.

**TOOL #2:LinkedIn Job Seeker Account**

The premium version is a MUST! It’s ~$35 a month and I had it for 2 months. Why? It allows you to contact recruiters – I got multiple phone interviews by using InMail feature asking recruiters if positions were still available. Sometimes they responded and other times they didn’t
The paid subscription allowed me to be a *“featured applicant”*
 
**TOOL #3:Google Docs Spreadsheet**
I used Google Docs to help keep track of all:
*dates of when I submitted the resume
*position applied for
* link to job description
*notes on who I talked to

**Step 2 – Phone Interviews**

I made sure I was in a quiet area
This is my weird tidbit but hey it worked!
*I did vocal warm-ups about 15 minutes before each call. I googled “tongue twisters” and read them aloud to warm up my voice. It helped. 
*I made sure I was dressed well
These little things helped me feel more comfortable
If I felt like I messed up I always made sure to write down what it was so I could make sure I didn't make the same mistake twice.
At the end of each call

**Step 3 – In-Person Interviews**

Ok
After my 1st
I was confused because I had gotten my resume looked at

**I realized I was the problem.**

I was not prepared for the interviews. Maybe it was because I was so drained from trying to be perfect on the resume and phone interviews that I thought “if I got this far
I had read behavior questions online and knew the basics of what was going to be asked when I went in

My problem was my inability to articulate EXACTLY what I had accomplished when interviewing. I struggled to answer questions like “how do you manage your time?” or “this position relies on analyzing lots of data

I would answer with “well I used checklists, so its part of my daily routine…”

These answers were not SPECIFIC; they were general, working on getting rid of the “ums” and “uhhhs”. I worked on getting straight to the point and not rambling. 

My 4th interview I tested the waters with my new approach

My 5th interview was when it all came together. I spent the weekend researching and learning all I could about the product/business – I even wrote a blog post about it and made sure to bring copies to the interview. But most importantly

I went into the 5th interview **PREPARED!**
I answered all the questions with “…sure

Practicing and practicing some more

A day later I was contacted and offered/accepted the job.

Find a job ad. Respond to job ad. Go to LinkedIn and see if I have connections there (ie. know someone who knows someone). If I knew someone I asked for an introduction. If I didn't I looked for either the hiring manager, if possible. I then wrote a personalized email about myself, offering to meet for coffee, etc.

I didn't do this for every job. I applied to numerous jobs every day

I also extended the formula by making a list of companies I want to work for and seeing if they had open positions in my line of work. Whether they did or not

I used a fairly generic résumé that I adapted slightly only to the opportunities where I was really interested in the job. I also had a generic cover letter I adapted slightly as well. 

I work in the marketing industry and somewhat senior level. I moved from a mid-size city (Portland

The new position pays more than I expected

I recently interviewed for a summer internship where 40 positions were available. I was told by HR they interviewed 45 people and I still couldn't get the fucking job. I would take a guess and say most of the 45 people interviewed were 20-22 years of age with little work experience.

Since leaving high school over ten years ago I've had 10-15 interviews for entry level office jobs and I've never once got a job or a second interview. Last year alone

This last rejection hit me the hardest as I had almost a 90% chance of landing an internship and for once getting a break and I still couldn't get it. Even though my grades are good I'm starting to question whats the point. I obviously come across terrible in interviews so when I finally graduate at 30 I'll have no professional experience just low end manual work so I'll probably struggle to get a job then too.

* We have no idea how many jobs you have applied/interviewed for. Take every application and interview serious.

* Sending out bulk resumes to various companies is worthless. If you are going to send your resume to 10 companies posting in a specific field you still need to customize every one depending on the job requirements. We can tell who is just sending out resume's and who is taking the time to make sure they their resume has addressed all of OUR job criteria along with a custom cover letter pertaining to details in our posting.

* Take the time to make your resume look good, try Bob_Smith_Resume.PDF. PDF's are cleaner, faster, easier and it show another small level of giving a crap.

* Add your other talents to your resume, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, QUICKBOOKS as their skills. 

* Job Hoppers - We are very wary of you. If you show as many jobs as you have been in the workforce we are not interested in spending the time to train you just for you to always be looking for something better. If you were working multiple jobs at the same time or were doing contract work

* Low experience applicants

* If we actually give you an interview spend a couple minutes researching our company

* Dress up regardless of the position being applied for


There are tons of other suggestions that I can offer and I would be happy to answer questions you may have, 5 actually showed up for their interview and only 2 showed interest and enthusiasm for getting the position.

I'm actually writing this post on behalf of my friend. She's worked at a small company for the past year, have kept her employed with the promise that they would be more profitable soon.

However, and no additional pay. Within the last month however, both of these partners have becoming outwardly hostile towards my friend, writing derogatory emails, calling her a bitch, telling her how ""dumb"" she is. As my friend has access to the company income and spending statements, she can see that they are very short on funds. It is assumed that these mean techniques are to make working so unpleasant, and they will not have to pay unemployment. She has not

So, and nothing lined up, she refused. They told her that she can either put in her 2 weeks notice, or be fired on the spot (today). Again refusing, my friend told them if they fire her, she would collect unemployment, to which they responded that she is 2 days short of collecting unemployment.

So, the better business bureau, or anyone else that can help with this. Is there anything that can be done?

**TLDR: Friend is forced to put in 2 weeks notice to quit her job. Company refuses to pay unemployment. Is this illegal?**

Edit: Partners just sent her an email with a note along the lines of ""thank you for informing us of your intent to leave the company. We wish you all the best."" - Clearly trying to make it appear on record that she had given some verbal notice of her leaving. Again

1. Act like you got the job - I went into every interview in the last two months thinking I got the job. It boosted my confidence and I did a lot better than I thought I did. Prior to this I went in thinking I am not qualified or that there is someone better than me. That just stressed me out more and effected my interview negatively. 

2. Go in there thinking you don't need the job - I went into the interview doing this but at the same time thinking I got the job if I wanted and wow...things changed. I got 4 offers within 2 weeks as soon as I started doing this. I am starting a graduate program so I went into the interview thinking ""whatever

3. Know your resume in and out. Make sure it has no mistakes. Make sure you know every detail on it. And make sure you practice the question ""Walk me through your resume.""

4. Make sure you know the answers and practice them to those typical questions listed everywhere online. One of the big ones is ""Tell me about yourself"" or ""What is your greatest strength and weakness?""

5. Make sure you tweak your cover letter to the specific job. I used to just use a generic Cover letter and just change the company name and position. I changed it to include keywords from the posting. I started getting a lot more responses for my apps!

Just remember to stay positive

EDIT
I have a little bit more time to write out some more tips so here they are.

1. Experience is very important. For months I didn't get anything except part-time interviews. At first

2. GPA. My GPA was low (2.5ish). I messed up my freshman and sophomore year but then I got my act together and tried to bring up my GPA as much as I could. I kept thinking this is what kept stopping me from getting any calls for my apps but it wasn't. I never put my GPA on my resume unless they asked me. There were a few companies that rejected me because of it but majority didn't even ask for my GPA. I had many that asked about my GPA and why it was low. I explained to them the real reason and they very somewhat understanding of it. So don't let your GPA bring you down.

In relation to number 4 above. Look up common interview questions for the company. You can go to Glassdoor.com and type in the company name. It will give you salaries ranges, employee reviews, and INTERVIEW REVIEWS. These interview reviews list questions the candidates were asked, the process, the position, and other information. This site helped me a lot! I prepared answers to the questions on the site and 6/10 times those questions would be asked. Make sure you have solid examples for questions. When asked a question I would always think of PSR. Problem - Solution - Result. I would state the problem, the solution I came up with,,1359676421.0,t3_17m0jp

So, everyone in the science and engineering industries were freaking out “There aren’t enough people going into science/engineering!” – “America needs more engineers, we won’t have enough” – “No one is going into Science/engineering. Will America fall behind technologically!?!?!1!!1?1!one”.  

Well. Guess what? I loved math, got an internship working 30+ hours a week. 18-22 credits a semester, I gave up so many things. And I did it! I graduated with my degree in Structural Engineering! I took the F.E. and passed! I was ready! … but guess what?   

That’s right. No jobs. Where did they go? No one could tell me. Were they coming back? “I don’t know” was the response. Well, in fact, it was a matter of national-fucking-security that I be some sort of scientist or engineer. And here I am, and there’s nothing! I have to work part time at fucking McDonalds and even then, I can’t afford my school loans. You tell me it’s because there’s just not enough money, no one is building, no one is investing. I call Bull Shit. I think people are hoarding money

Now, you know what will happen? Your company is up shit creek with no paddle. Why? Because instead of INVESTING in younger engineers and training them, you sat on your stacks and whined that you were no longer making 40billion a year, only 10 billion. And that just wasn’t enough for the Jet AND the M3.   

So guess what. Fuck you. Fuck all of you and your stupid companies. I hope in the end

1. Hiring manager does the basic screening
1. I review them and identify which ones should be brought in for an interview.
1. Applicant comes in, and one of his future peers. We then get together almost immediately after they leave to discuss (this is why email thank you letters are important!).
1. My boss will look for personality and fit with the culture.

1. The future peer, and some technical skill.

1325023435.0,nsrfy,How I tripled my response rate to applications and ended up landing a job that will nearly double my yearly salary. AMAA.,KelM0,93,16,36,"Hey r/jobs! Thought I'd share my success with you in hopes that what I did can maybe help someone else land a job.

**My Story:** 

I finished my master's degree (in writing) in August of 2010 and have been looking for a ""real"" job since. I was underemployed (working two part time jobs and barely making ends meet) and getting very little response to applications all of last fall/spring. I actually got a job I was really excited about in Nov of 2010 (through a friend) but had it taken away at the last minute for circumstances out of my control. It sucked. This past summer, and I just accepted a position that I'm super excited about with a decent salary and great benefits. It can be done, even in this economy!

**The Numbers:**

I made a [perty graph](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#0) detailing the difference between my two periods of job searching. In the first period I applied for 28 jobs and only got 3 responses: two telephone interviews and one in person interview/hire (through a personal contact

**My Methods:**

I want to start by saying all of the jobs I applied for with the exception of two (one in the first period and one in the second) were positions that I found through online search engines. Both jobs that I was personally recommended for I got responses to, it's not the end of the world. 

I relied primarily on craigslist and idealist.com, and communication/web marketing) I did not put my resume online for employers to find me; I didn't want to limit myself and I wanted to control what of my background employers saw.

I would search for jobs 2 or 3 times a week, which I would further modify to fit the specifics of each individual job. Same with cover letters: I would reuse parts, but each letter was individually crafted to fit the specifics of each job description.  I spent a minimum of an hour on each application, usually more like 2-3. If the job did not have a specified date of first review, I tried to get my application in within three days of when it was posted, a week on the outside edge. If it had been more than a week and I hadn't applied, I took the job off of my list; my time was better spent looking for more recent postings. 

**The Changes I Made:**

1. My resume. The biggest difference in the response rate is, I revamped the look so it was more modern, and added just a hint of color so it popped. I wanted it to stand out; people judge you not only by what's on your resume, but how professional it looks. I googled creative and unique resumes and used them as inspiration for my own. Second, I changed my job titles. I've primarily worked for very small companies, with sort of vague job titles. I basically made them sound more important without lying. If an prospective employer contacted one of these old jobs, my ex-bosses wouldn't care that I'd called myself an ""writing specialist"" instead of a ""tutor."" This won't work for everyone because some companies are very grouchy about such things. Here is a version of my [old resume](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#3) and one of my [new resume](http://imgur.com/a/5WwLE#2), which some people rail against.  I did not find it to be a detriment

2. The types of jobs I was applying for.  When I finished my master's program, non-profits, and some communications positions and I had no problem finding interesting sounding opportunities in these areas. Think slightly outside your box of knowledge and you'll have way more things to apply for - this also gives you an angle to take into interviews. In the job I just accepted, I sort of branded myself as an outsider candidate; I knew that I didn't have the ""traditional"" background, but showed how my unusual experiences would bring new ideas to the organization.

3. Local address. During my first period of applications, well, that's where I lived! I could have easily gotten in my car and driven the 6 hours for an interview, but I don't think that employers knew that. They're getting hundreds of resumes for each position, and just looking for any reason to throw yours into the no pile. In my second period of applications, I asked my cousin (who lives in San Francisco) if I could use her address, and she agreed. Of course, I admitted it was my cousin's address and said I was splitting my time between there and CO. I used the hell out of my frequent flier miles going back and forth for interviews. I did include my CO address on applications where I knew it wouldn't matter (usually for larger companies who are looking for the best employee regardless of geographical location

* Applications require home address (may include past), and they haven't reached the background checks yet. For most employers who talks of treating job hunting like going on dates, these are information that you wouldn't nonchalantly hand out to the stranger across the dinner table. 

* They go on to ask about job histories. Some, inflated ones) and numbers. To truly showcase your career biography, is job-hunting suicide.

* Between all the blogs and the books of ""experts"" yelling at the applicants, make sure to not write that in there...Any hint of the individual being him/herself is considered toxic and unwelcome. 

* This would be even worse than the applicants who TRULY aimed for a particular organization to work with. It's been your top choice and maybe you've built your whole academic careers around this organization and its subject areas. Or it caught your eyes just as you're about ready to charge out there and make a difference. Or you were willing to move across the country for that opportunity! In the end

* You lead your own life. Sometimes things don't work out the way they do. It happens but you've learned to deal with it as a growing human being. You bounce back and still get the job done. The employer, a late appointment, a slip of the tongue about your private life, and you're done for. In their narrow viewing glass, any event caused by something out of your control is obviously an egregious violation to the moral and ethics that is being the perfect worker. You are deemed less from then on. 

To the organization, from their perspective, means that shit happens because of numbers, deal with it. But to the applicants, who opened up so much about themselves and put their livelihoods on the line, it's not about being singled out and purposely denied a job - the phrase means being treated like less than a human being.

Like a lot of you guys

I have a ton of great experience. I've worked in a variety of positions

* 1) My job experience was all over the place. I worked in a bunch of different fields. Even though I'm good at what I do

* 2) I had a huge gap in resume after my last job 15 months ago.

* 3) Due to a lot of early success

* 4) I was fired from two jobs and had issues when companies demanded references from those specific companies.

I applied to well over a hundred positions

**All that changed when I decided the honest approach wasn't working. I decided to fudge things on my resume.**

What I did was pretty simple... 

* 1) I made up a fake position (at a real company) to fill the gap on my resume. I was very careful to say it was a contract position so it could not be verified by W2s or through HR.

* 2) I matched what I did at that job to whatever job I was applying to exactly. Example: If it was a sales position, after all!

* 3) I asked a close friend to act as the reference for me. In this case

After I blasted that resume out I had 10 interviews the following week. Within a month I had 4 offers to pick from. I even passed background and reference checks.

I just started with the company and they're delighted to have me. My whole job search turned around when I decided the honest approach wasn't worth it anymore.

My intent was in no way malicious - the ad was pulled after about 6 hours and I deleted each resume after reading it

Now, but I'm sure their verification process is much more efficient than CL's.
_____________________________________________________________

In the 6 hours the ad was posted

In the ad
 
- Only 2 provided one with their resume
- 60% just put a 2-3 paragraph introductory blurb about themselves in the text of the email
- 25% just wrote a paragraph or less (e.g. intro + contact info)
- The rest only put something along the lines of ""Hello"" (literally just that) ""My resume is attached. [First Name]"" or ""Re: [Position Title]""
_____________________________________________________________

General Observations:

* I purposefully specified that resumes had to be submitted as a Word .doc

* Despite advertising the job as ""entry-level"" (min. 1 year of experience) and listing a salary just above minimum wage

* The better resumes (IMO) were the ones that only listed 2-3 positions with detailed job descriptions

* Formatting: the best resumes were the ones that seemed like they had the most white space on them. Good use of space + simple descriptions were the winning combo. 

* Although I shouldn't have to scroll to the second page past your education

* Quite a few people applying with indirectly relevant experience and then not putting any effort whatsoever to justify it in their cover letter/blurbs

EDIT: Here's a big one -&gt; since I was using Gmail, but keep that in mind.
____________________________________________________________

Greatest sins: 

- Non-Title Sentences That Were Written Like This.
- Inconsistent dates (i.e. Nov-Dec 2012: XX
- A really stellar resume that was titled ""[Applicant Name] - Oct. 2011""
- Or resumes with titles that screamed generic resume like ""[Applicant Name] - Administrative Resume"" or ""office resume"" or ""Resume - AA""
- Positions listed with no actual description of what they did in this position
- Terrible or inconsistent formatting
- Inconsistent bolding of words/titles - i.e. **Position A
- Repetitive job descriptions - i.e. it was obvious they had copy + pasted the same description for different positions with similar duties

They refused to buy the software needed for our data analysis so they insisted that we go through **hundreds of thousands of lines** of data by hand and I expressed how ludicrous that was.

Anyways, then shit got fucked up.  But, I got through it.  I called my manager to let me know that I was not to be able to get to additional work that they wanted me to because I ran into problems.  I explained in full detail what happened, what went wrong, how I fixed it, etc.  Then he went into a rant about how it was important, do some of it, it was obvious he didn't give a shit and I said I would figure it out.

So I change my flight from 6:30 to 9:00 (Delayed til 10), I have late flight and I can't do that as I don't have a building key.  Come to find out this was just a ploy to get me to drop the equipment off and get it out of my possession.  I get everything done, get to the airport and get on my flight.  

This manager is the definition of a micro-manager.  He once demanded that I give him a summary about how everyone acted in a sales meeting with a vendor ""Who was the most verbal

I arrive at the office and he tells me that because I didn't call-in this morning and inform of my late flight (That he knew about all along) that I'm not a good fit and there needs to be constant communication.  Yeah, but I was more focused on getting the task at hand done and just how the fuck I was going to get back home that night.  And since I didn't call, that I am no longer employed there.  23 hours, two cities, completed tasks at hand (and more) and you're firing me because I didn't call you?  ""Well if you would have called me, I would have realized that you worked 23 hours and you could have come in at 10 today""  Just because you pay me salary and get out of paying overtime, doesn't mean you can work us however long/much you want.

Anyways, they would require us to go to lunch and everyone pay separately even me who always brought my lunch.  And we had to do these videos and news articles while were doing that data analysis and flying around the country collecting more data.

All you need is a Bachelor's in anything. The major does not matter.

Some districts don't even require you to be credentialed at all. You can sometimes pay money for a 1 year waiver to see if it's what you really want to do. This means if you think you'll find a job before the year is up

In California, it's not hard stuff. It's mostly High School Level Proficiency. 

This job is perfect for when you are looking for work because you aren't forced to take a job every day. They call you usually from a phone system, etc. without having to take leave really. 

Not to knock Substitute Teachers or anything

The best part

The pay isn't extremely well or anything, it's good pay for what you have to put in. 

Anyway, and Subbing can help you!


**Edit**: After reading some of the responses

Yes

I had to pay the waiver fee becuase I didn't have a credential

I also had to get a TB test done

I should have said this depends obviously on the location. I live in the central coast of California, went to a 4 hour orientation, and did the required paperwork. Each district is obviously going to be different.

All I meant this post to be was an out-of-the-box idea that some people might not have thought of. It was meant for those, that if I didn't sub, I would be underwater in debt, even living with my parents. I didn't really mean for this to be anymore than an idea for people.

Getting to the point. The other week I attended some free training on how to handle interviews. The person running the event was very experienced and had interviewed people for about 10-12 years.

I thought I'd pass on the advice in the hope that it helps someone. Maybe you don't have any events near you or something like that. Anyway

1. **Always** take a copy of your CV/resume with you. Fairly straightforward but he mentioned that not everyone does this. Even when interviewers don't ask for it they still like to see it there. His top tip was to carry it with you into the interview, just having it there is enough. It shows that you are confident and it's almost like you are saying, ""Yeah, there it is. There's my proof that I can walk this.""

2. The advertisement for the position pretty much tells you what they're going to ask. Again fairly obvious but I am just regurgitating the info he fed me. So...  ""You must be a good team worker."" You will be asked about team work. Easy.

3. Answering the interview questions. This is the bit I was most enthusiastic about because I never knew how to answer them. This was honestly the most valuable thing I took away. He says pretty much every interview has a scoring system. Usually there are a total of 5 points to be earned per question then the total is tallied up at the end. Having the highest total doesn't mean you're guaranteed the job but following this properly means you'll be somewhere near the top of the list when they're considering who to hire.

The structure for a good answer goes like this. Here we'll just use

* 1 point - Simply tell them. Straightforward. You tell them how competent you are/how much experience you have. Or some other variation. Apparently a lot of people just stop here. Don't do this. Examples will be below the points if I can figure out how to format it.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets.""

* 2 points - Elaborate a bit. Where did you gain some of this experience? Doing what?

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit.""

* 3 points - Introduce another example. Different if possible but if not it can be in the same area.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit. I also had to work to a *lot* of deadlines when I was at university/college.""

* 4 points - Prove the benefit or show the outcome of your skill/ability. Relate it to your second given example.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit. I also had to work to a *lot* of deadlines when I was at university/college. But I found that staying organised meant that the projects/essays/whatever were always handed in on time.""

Most good interviewees apparently fall into the 3-4 area. But a really good answer will exceed the criteria.

* 5 points - To exceed the criteria you need to show how your skills have helped other people or the business you worked for.

&gt; ""I've got a lot of experience working to targets. When I worked at X our team were given sales targets to hit. I also had to work to a *lot* of deadlines when I was at university/college. But I found that staying organised meant that the projects/essays/whatever were always handed in on time. When I was delegated tasks to be completed in small groups my ability to work to targets helped us achieve one of the best marks for X project.""

Realistically you can't exceed the criteria on every question but when you can it will score some big bonus points with the interviewer.

I feel like I'm really underselling how good the advice was. I won't name the company so I seem like some sly promoter. BUT! In literally my first interview since applying this advice I got the job ( I've since left). I was looking for a good few months before applying this advice and had no success. That's why I don't want to put it down to coincidence. I could tell the interviewer was impressed with my answers

SO: Anticipate the questions through the job advertisement. Answer with some semblance to the format given.

I was working at a marketing office as a sales. We have a team of 5 people and we all started at the same time. We worked here for about 2 months then last last Tuesday our manager came out of his office and said we're all fired. This was all the president's decision and we were not warned or anything. He fired the whole team on the spot and said we don't have to come in the next day.

so that very Friday was also payday. I got a direct deposit check for that Monday and Tuesday we worked but no money for the whole week before that should have been included in that check. We asked our manager about it and he said he'll tell the president to mail it to us. It's been a week now and still nothing. The president keeps trying to push the topic off when someone asks.

I didn't get to comb through lots of resumes

Presumably I got the already vetted resumes since we were calling them in for interviews.  Despite this barely any of them were tailored at all for the position.  They were mostly from recent grads, if hired, will not stay.  My take away is, it would not be difficult to be ahead of the crowd by tailoring your resume more.  It seems most job seekers are playing a numbers game.  So you may be able to differentiate yourself by playing a quality game.  

Interviews: To be honest most people did better here, so one of the things I asked is to describe to me cases in which they have researched difficult to find information.  This should come easy to anyone with a liberal arts degree, yet this question would stump interviewees.  

Lastly, or any sort of career development.  No questions about our company culture or management style.

1328713614.0,pgaj0,After only two months I landed a job in my field that is not minimum wage grunt work with no real experience or even a bachelor's degree! Thank you r/jobs for your great advice!,matildax20,74,9,35,"Thursday I was called back after submitting my resume for a social research job (I am a Sociology major taking a year off from undergraduate studies) that pays decently well above minimum wage for not requiring a bachelor's

Basically

The advice that I gleaned from r/jobs and applied to getting the position is pretty extensive

1) Use r/resumes

2) Your second draft of your resume is not your final draft.  Rework it many

3) Dress your best.  I had interviews for fast food,000/yr military jobs, etc and I wore the same thing to every single one.  Black pantsuit (navy might be better even), pressed white shirt, conservative jewelry, no nail polish, light makeup, dress like your career depends on it.

4) Research bad interview habits. I never knew I bit the inside of my mouth during interviews until I read about bad habits.  Get to an interview ten minutes early at least. I always practiced answers to probable questions in the shower or car ride to the interview. NEVER wing an interview.

5) Be aware during an interview. Don't start a sentence without knowing where it is going. Interviewers don't mind if you think about a question for a minute before answering, your smile and ""ums or uhs"".

6) Practice your handshake. I don't care if you are a football athlete or a 98 lb. girl if you shake hands like you are a dead fish you are going to put off your interviewer right away. Firm! Make eye contact!

7)  If someone asks you how you feel about handling a responsibility or how you would deal with a situation don't make up a hypothetical or just respond

8) Always be selling yourself. Don't say things like: I need the money, or I want to get my foot in the door in the industry. 

9)  Follow-up with a thank you no matter what and a phone call if they don't get back to you.

10) Don't give up! Granted, I realize I would have hated. I was going for the money and not the long term benefit to my passions and goals.  Interviewers can tell when you have thrown in the towel. Pump up with good music, dance around your house, or stop on the way there for ice cream or another favorite treat to get your mood up!

1316276047.0,kiqfr,Resume tips from a hiring manager,Agnostoman,76,10,35,"I'm a manager who is trying to find a bunch of good folks. 90% of the resumes I receive stink.

The best advice I can give is: Spend a lot of time on your resume. This is your one shot to get my attention and you have around 30 seconds to reel me in. 

* Proofread: I can't tell you how often I see resumes with typographical errors, make suggestions, etc. Friends, family, the internet, etc.

* Watch your tenses. It drives me nuts when someone mixes tenses. Even worse

* Unless it's on paper, and then show me the projects you worked on. The header can be the name of the project and a short description. Try to use numbers and facts for impact. ""Project X - Led 10 member team on a 25 million dollar project to replace legacy system.... resulted in savings of 5 million dollars per year."" Under that, list the duties you had for the project. This also feeds into the next point:

* Search Engine Optimization. Almost every company is using electronic recruiting systems. Many of these search by comparing the job description keywords to your resume. As an example, you've just included that phrase several times in a project based resume. On the other hand, keyword stuff is bad. I've seen resumes along the lines of: ""A good business analyst is a business analyst who analyzes requirements."" 

* Be a little creative with the formatting. When I was searching for a job, font, and font size. It feels like work. Try to format it so the most important information jumps out. 

* Make your resume applicable to the job. I see a lot of resumes where the applicant doesn't even bother to change the objective objective. I've seen objective statements that mention a desire to teach children, keep a version of the resume for each career track you're applying for. If you try to make one resume for all the careers you're interested in, you'll appear to lack specific skills, or even worse, desparate! Yes, this does take time, but if it's your job to find a job

* Make sure your objective is skewed to how YOU will help the company. Objectives like ""I want to find a position that will help me hone my writing skills"". To me, quality.....""

* If you don't like the idea of the objective statement

* Unless you're delivering it in person, and it ""smells"" like a boilerplate letter, you've actually lost credibility. Overall, make sure it's not a ""Re-tread"" of the resume. The cover leader should be high level and it should include information about the company, position, etc. Think of it as a sales brochure. Example: Instead of ""My C++, PHP, XML... experience is ideal""

* Watch your e-mail address. Make sure your e-mail address is something professional. firstname.lastname@gmail.com is ideal. I see a lot of resumes with e-mails like buffguy69@aol.com. That's an epic fail. 

* Keep tweaking and testing. Learn from your experiences

Hope this helps!

I started working for a web startup a while ago

Out of 20 employees in our branch, but in a lighter fashion. It was really fun and exciting!

As we went through this restructure, that I was able to get others to help me out, and get my duties done in half the time, without my involvement at all.

So I was promoted up to the highest non-upper management position within the company, because I didn't realize I'd be working 14 hour days which is something I just wont do for my own sanity. Also unfortunately for me, my former position no longer existed, as I consolidated it into other departments. So I had the option of either taking a really low position job, or resign, and wait until another position opens up elsewhere in another company owned by our parent company.

I decided that after nearly 2 years with no vacation

A few days before leaving, and it's probably just the weather. So I thought nothing of it.

----------------------

Any ways

Time goes on, and nothing is happening. So I get aggressive and finally get a call from one of the managers... The first thing they told me when I picked up the phone was, ""Circ-Le-Jerk, I will never recommend you for a job, much less forward you a resume."" WTF...... I didn't see that fucking coming. 

Let's go back a little bit. See, just to see if there is anything that I may like. Maybe they'd have a really good offer.

Now, this would be my undoing, considering the bad blood between the founders.

Apparently, I did it intentionally, and was a huge insult to everyone there. It wasn't so much me looking at other companies, it was because it looked like I was rubbing it in.

Interviewer: we like to look for loyalty in our employees.  How do you show your loyalty to an employer?

Me: I'm sorry can you clarify?

Interviewer: well we like to hire employees who are interested in the long haul and aren't looking to make a quick buck

Me : Oh, well I think there is something to loyalty and mutual respect between employers and employees...*[rest of answer]*

Why is this relevant, but the job was interesting.  But SERIOUSLY loyalty is a two way street.  You have this reputation and have the gall to ask about my loyalty?  You are asking because you clearly want to recruit people who are loyal to you beyond what is in their interest, you want an employee that you can take advantage of.  You are being sued for age discrimination because you laid off people near retirement and my loyalty is your concern?  Loyalty is earned, as is respect, from both ends.  I see lots of articles on here about 'why you didn't hire me'.  Honestly, many people are in positions where they don't have the option of rejecting jobs, but even those forced to accept a position will be instantly looking for better options when a publicly disloyal company is asking about their loyalty.  Its a setup and a trap and people aren't stupid.  Respect me and be loyal to me (and yes this starts in the interview process) and you will see the same in return.  Don't

In 2010 I received my degree in Art History, CA to stay with my Aunt while we looked for work. After months we were lucky to get jobs at a pizza parlor, which was funny since that was the job I had before entering college. A month or so later my wife got a job with the Exploratorium in SF, I followed shortly, although my position was part-time and temporary. At this point we were doing better, feeling a lot better, but were still stuck at my Aunt's house (a halfway house in reality).  

After about 6 months in, and I was able to walk to work in 10 minutes. It was pretty amazing. Out of 30 or so Art History grads, I was one of the few that was actually working in a museum. 

Well, but these were getting bigger. My job description was quite large, but I was really only doing the same few tasks over and over again, every day. I could do anything else happily, but once other departments learned I could do these repetitive tasks, they all started asking me to do them. So it was Groundhog Day in a museum setting. I started to dwell on the fact that I was doing the same tasks over and over, barely ever spent time in the actual art portion of the museum, as many say

I ended up landing a job for an online technology school, was in the education field which I also enjoy, and was in a nice city. This place though, was truly a mess. Regardless of any negative lens I could be looking through, they were doing some unscrupulous things, and the student was the last thing they cared about and frequently mentioned it. I was now away from art of all kinds, working with greedy and cruel coworkers, I finally succumbed to letting my disappointment shine through

In just a weeks time we had to pack up and move back to my hometown, daughter, and myself in a 1 bedroom apartment. In the past 6 months I have turned in over 100 applications with only 2 interviews. My wife has turned in 100's and has had 1 opportunity to take a test, just to get an interview. I finally got a part-time job, but its 18 hours a week and if my unemployment goes away, we won't be able to keep going. With school loans, car payment, and our habit of eating food for sustenance

In between work, and wasn't doing exactly what I thought I would be, but it paid well. My family had health care, we had extra money to do fun things, my coworkers liked me, and we lived in the Bay Area. So I think the lesson I learned, and I hope what stands out about this story, and make an ok job worse and worse? I see a lot of posts about being unhappy at the job, and most importantly how I changed my families lives. It's really sad to think that it was all changed simply because I wasn't as comfortable as I thought I should be,

All of these are true, and recruiters will copy what others are doing because they won't think for themselves. Of course, in many of these cases the decisions are not theirs to make, but the reasoning still stands. 

**#6 Blacklists:** If you are letting someone else evaluate your candidates for you

One time I had an interview scheduled for 8am. I was heading out the door at 7am when I checked my email and my first choice job had sent me an offer. I accepted the offer and returned it

**#5 Automated Resume Processing:** Do you ever go through your spam folder just to check that you hadn't missed anything important? Do you do that more or less often than you go through the resumes rejected by your automated resume processing system written by the lowest bidder to make sure it's not kicking out people that would be perfect for your company? 

**#4 Drug Testing:** As indicated above, you fire them. If they show up on time and do their job, why do you care what they do on their off hours? 

**#3 Background Checks:** I strongly support legislation requiring disclosure to applicants of background check reports used to disqualify them for a job, do it right now. If you don't want to, then you don't trust the system you're using to screen employees. 

Yeah

**#2 Social Profiles:** Give me the names of your roommates from college and all your yearbooks and let me decide if you can keep your job. If this seems like a bad idea, we'll just assume it's his eighteenth beer of the night and he was getting ready to drive home and rape someone's daughter. It's safer that way. 

**#1 Being Unemployed Means Staying Unemployed:** This nonlogic is truly too stupid for words. Stuff happens in this economy - jobs are cancelled

Also consider  that someone who put a gap in their employment on their resume is the one that's being honest

As I have indicated - these are all the result of knee-jerk reactions to just make the job easier without any actual consideration as to whether they are actually having the desired effect. It's the equivalent of handing someone a hundred resumes to review and they just grab the top half of the stack and shred it because who wants to hire people with bad luck?

A week later, and bitter.  It was a job he really wanted, and thought for sure he was a shoe-in for.  When he told me about this, I advised him to write a thank you note to the firm, as difficult as it might be at this point.  

He asked ""Why?"".  I responded ""For a number of reasons."":

* It reflects graciousness on your part

* That graciousness will elevate your stature in the eyes of the people who passed you over

* If things don't work out with their selected candidate

* It might make them realize what a quality candidate you are and spur them to see if there's any other openings at their firm that you might not have been aware of and which they now feel you might be a good fit for.


He begrudgingly agreed and asked for my help in crafting the note.  I told him it should pattern itself on the following structure:

* Acknowledgement of their decision
* Expression of disappointment (without sounding devastated or bitter)
* Sincere wishes for success with their selection
* Expression of thanks for the opportunity to interview with them
* A request to keep him in mind if things don't work out with their selection

He followed my advice and immediately received a response indicating that he was at the top of their list to contact if their selected candidate didn't work out.

1376430638.0,1kb2dy,My first experience from the other side: I'm a newly minted supervisor and I just went through a pile of resumes and invited folks on interviews. I was surprised at what drove my decisions.,NunsWithHerpes,70,12,73,"Let me just preface this by saying I AM NOT A HUMAN RESOURCES PROFESSIONAL. I'm a working professional who supervises a team of 4 to 6 people and I was asked by my HR person to go through resumes and applications to invite people to interview and fill a spot on that team. This is my first experience at something like this and I'm completely untrained in HR, but my supervisor/interviewer self felt justified in doing. Here are just a few things I noted. 

**-The details matter.** You all know this already and it's nothing new but it was weird to see it first hand. It was always a fear of mine as an applicant that I'd find a minor spelling error on the resume/CV that I'd just submitted to a couple dozen places. And guess what, resume layout, unprofessional e-mail address, etc.). Those things were definitely not make or break errors, but it was just an annoyance that they had to overcome. 

**-Brevity is the soul of employment.** I probably didn't spend more than 60 seconds looking through any given resume + application packet so resumes were getting skimmed and not fully read. Bullet points and brevity are your friend (and I immediately realized all my past resumes/CVs were not friendly in this way and smacked myself because

**-Certifications and licenses matter.** This may be profession specific, and in this case, as a professional in the agency I work for. It may cost you up front in money, time, supervision, or whatever to get licensed/certified but these things matter. The specific job I was hiring for could be done by somebody with or without a bachelor's level license/certification. But even though I knew that, I always leaned more towards people with these licenses/certifications because they are just much more flexible. I didn't want to hire someone and then have them unable to help the team out because they can't perform duty X because they aren't licensed to provide duty X, I'd be shouting ""aww come on

**-Take applications seriously.** I understand it's easier to write ""see resume"" instead of hand writing your whole job history. I think it's stupid and redundant from both the applicant and employer side

**-Apply for a specific job.** The applicant in me hates this one. As an applicant you try to be open to so many job opportunities because you just want to work. You may be open to just about any job at an agency. I understand casting a broad net as an applicant, when I'm hiring for a specific position and I see resume objectives that are so broad they could apply to anything from airplane pilot to janitor to President of the United States, it doesn't really tell me why I should hire you for this job that I need done.

**-Don't try to say what you think we want to hear, but I knew it when I heard it. So I guess the advice would be to get out of the supervisor and HR person's head. They don't even know what they're looking for. Stay in your own head and write what makes sense to you in the context of the position you are applying for. 

**-I judge where you went to school.**  Online colleges weren't immediate rejections, but that's the perception). I didn't do too much judging like small liberal arts school versus community college transfer versus big state school types of things because I actually think each of those has excellent merits. I could see where others might though.  

**-I judged your GPA too.** I don't have much to go on and only 60 seconds to do so. If you had a 2.0 GPA, but I don't have much else to go on in 60 seconds. Again, not a deal breaker but you better show me something somewhere else that makes up for it. 

I'll qualify all this by saying that I was aware of the unfairness of these things and actively worked to give everyone a fair shot and put myself in their shoes. I actually went back into my NO pile after being a bit more aware of the bias at the end and rechecked the first half that I had looked at and one of them ended up getting an interview after I reevaluated. So even somebody aware of the trivial and wacky nature of this whole process needed a self-check to get it right. I didn't just throw a font/format I didn't like in the NO pile if that's what it seems like

Anyway, maybe I'll share my thoughts about the actual interviews as well. Good luck guys.

I am not going to bring in all of the applicants for an interview for a 1 hour interview with another hour of prep and wrap-up would take an entire week of my time. I have a division to run and I simply can’t afford to do it. Some of them are getting interviews and some aren’t.  So

1.	For god’s sake

	a)	Press F7 and run spell check. Also

	b)	Check your grammar. If your grammar isn’t that great

	c)	Use consistent tense. Previous work was in the past tense and current work is in the present tense. 

	d)	Use consistent formatting across your resume. Don’t switch from all bullets to all paragraphs then back. 

	e)	Line breaks are your friend. 300 words in a giant block of text is not going to get read. 

2.	Most places upload resumes into an HR system which spit-out a format-scrubbed text file to the hiring manager. Make sure your resume looks good when it’s stripped naked. Copy paste to notepad to see how it looks. Bullet points in particular tend to look strange when converted.

3.	If you use an acronym

4.	If you were a contractor at a client

	BIG COMPANY XYZ via CONSULTING COMPANY ABC

	or

	CONSULTING COMPANY ABC: PROJCET ALPHA at BIG COMPANY XYZ
	
	If I have to guess

5.	If you have a degree, list it anyway. If it’s in anyway unclear, I’ll have to guess and that too makes me doubtful. 

I know a lot of people who think “But my skills should speak for themselves” or “I’m applying for an IT job, I’m not going to try to plod my way through your mud-pit of a resume when the next one on the pile is clear and concise. It’s going in the no-pile. Second, communication skills are absolutely necessary for an IT job. I need standard operating procedures and business cases. I need my IT person to explain things to my accountants. If you can’t write, I probably don’t want you on my team.

Now, my Paypal account was verified, in good standing - and had been around for quite some time.

I withdrew around 75% of the deposit to my bank account, to the tune of about $130 last night. A hungry family, a lonely girl and a guy who'd had a shitty day.

After spending 2 hours trying to order for them (being in the UK is a pain)

I woke up to an email from Paypal

30 minutes later, who put me in touch with someone fairly high up. That person got the account reviewed again, and in the end - I received the same email with a ""THIS DECISION IS FINAL"" message appended. The reason I was given is that consultancy and freelance work is apparently too high a risk for Paypal.

I don't feel comfortable signing anything, and within that 10 day timespan, I've gotten two further e-mails from them, saying that not only do I need to sign this termination letter to get the severance, but *'in order for my unemployment benefits to be approved, I NEED to sign this termination contract.'*  Umm really?  Because that smells like complete BS...i've never heard of anyone needing to sign a contract to get benefits.

I believe they are trying to trick me into signing the contract so that they can get out of dealing with my benefits (and having their insurance premiums go up).  I STILL haven't responded to them, then isn't that all that matters?

I'm deeply distraught about my current job situation


I work at a biotech company developing a platform for diagnostic assays - vague, but much faster-paced because it tends to be based on pre-existing formulations.  My team is under a ton of pressure from the CEOs to churn out developed chemistries as fast as possible.  There are a good number of criteria and design constraints that must be met for each of them (%CVs must be below X, variability must be less than such-and-such under such-and-such conditions, etc), but they're not so stringent that I would say they're ready for validation.


I'm completely new to industry and chemistry is not my strong suit, ignoring the bulk of the evidence we've gathered that suggests that the formulation is not working, and instead present the one graph that looks okay and tell them that everything's passing with flying colors.  I have to look them in the eye when my partner says these things and smile and nod.  Once the lie is in place, I then have to back it up with data that is simply unattainable and I get shit from my boss for it.  At this point my boss has lied to the CEOs about the degree of progress made on the project, so now HE'S under pressure to get results out of me.  


This is apparently common practice for everyone here.  We all lie to each others' faces about the ""science"" so that we look better in the short term (it's not science if you're ignoring the data you don't want to see)


I firmly believe this system is going to drive the company into the ground, but I'm running out of steam.  I hate chemistry (my degree is in bioengineering), and I hate this company.  I left at noon today because I couldn't keep myself from crying.  Seriously.  I hate lying to people and I hate discrediting myself by pretending I'm okay with it.  I'm afraid of speaking out.  This entire organization is hollow and fear-based.


Is this how all industry jobs are?  If so

**TL;DR: The company I work for rewards those who lie and fires those who are honest.  Is this normal?  ~~Should I leave?~~ I will be quitting as soon as I have another job lined up.**

I'm creating a throwaway account and creating a post - I hope this will help y'all with your job searches.

I'm currently a manager for a company and I'm hiring for another team member. This is a very typical entry-level

1. No relevant experience with no cover letter - I read a resume first. If there is no obvious experience or background

2. 5+ years of experience in any field or education beyond a Bachelors - I understand this is a low-paying position and the #1 reason applicants withdraw their application is because of the pay. If you have a graduate degree and/or are a seasoned applicant

3. Does not live close to the area - just like with reason 2


Here are some minor reasons why I've passed on resumes before:

- Typos. Blah! Proofread!

- One guy talked in his cover letter about how he battled alcoholism

- One guy sent in a hardcopy of his resume when the instructions are very clear to apply online. I don't like applicants who ignore instructions... his resume was ignored.

It's 13 pages long so I will post them 1 at a time so that everyone on here can benefit from them. Please feel free to add to this if you found more advice to help people be more successful when interviewing for a job.

**Overview** 


* 70% of a successful interview is enthusiasm, talk with them 
* 20% of the interview is selling you 
* 10% of the interview is the close. 1: The interview is a sales call and you're the product 2: Ask questions 3: Overcome objections 


**Before the Interview** 

* Dress in a plain navy or dark colored business suit
* Men: White shirt and conservative tie, well shined shoes 
* Women: Light colored blouse
* Research the company 
* Arrive 10-15 Minutes early before an interview 
* Bring a copy of your resume 
* Prepare a copy of any references 
* Bring a pen and notebooks to take notes before
* Prepare questions to ask  during the interview 
* Greet everyone in the office with a smile and hello 
* Fill out all applications neatly and completely
* Greet the interviewer with a smile and by their last name
* Give a firm handshake 
* Psyche yourself up! It's ok to be nervous or a little frightened. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain! 
* Be prepared for the interview because you won't get a second chance to make a first impression                                                 

**During the interview**

* Have a positive attitude
* Be confident
* Represent yourself honestly 
* Maintain direct eye contact
* Sit up straight
* Use FEB selling to answer employer's questions
* Ask questions about the position
* Don't ask questions about salary, vacations, ot anything else the company can do for you. Wait until you've gotten the job offer
* Don't get too comfortable
* Don't ever say anything negative and be careful when talking about past and present employers 

**After the interview**

* Jot down notes to help you remember the highlights of the interview (questions

Everyone keeps talking about job creation. But the real problem lies with the jobs that all ready exist. There has been a profound change in the workplaces of the US
People talk of worker's rights. The real discussion is of respect for workers, and a reasonable workload. Does anyone remember Holiday bonuses? Younger employees sit wide-eyed to hear tales from the seasoned about checks large enough to shop with, and parties where there was food and alcohol. There used to be a time when as a worker announced they were leaving, the employer would immediately begin to find a replacement and, get this, actualy offer that person more money or benefits if they were a valuable member of the team. Now the holidays pass with a buffet line that crosses two time zones. While most employees take a tray back to their cubicle, others chew in sober silence as holiday music spikes anxieties about money during the season. Empty chairs seem to be a theme of this election. But no one is talking about all of the empty chairs on the job. No employer wants to make headlines for mass layoffs, usually because these personnel foolishly dedicated their lives to the company and have reached the top of the payscale, or even acknowledgment of their extra burden. At that point they will eliminate the position all together if the others seem to be handling the burden without gripe. Hhhmm, ""You're lucky to have a job."" Game over. The world really hasn't changed that much
So from what eternal hellspring does this new non-culture of the workplace sloth towrds us? The corporation, if she hadn't she may very well have imploded. The corporation, as a person, has been likened to a sociopathic psychopath by psychiatrists examining the goals, motives, and actions of the corporation as a whole. A corportation was once a group of people with a common goal, say to build a bridge, the corporation would dissolve or move onto another specific project. Now the reason for existance is the mindless, respect,False

* Student loan debt in the US tops $1trillion

* Employers universally complain of a skills shortage when they're actually refusing to hire &amp; train entry level employees

* Young people as a group have been hardest hit due to above mention point with employees

* Some say the economy won't fully recover for years

* Some employers are finding that they can do more with less by working their remaining employees harder after 
laying off the rest. (Because for the employee it's either ""Work harder for less

* Older employees are working longer and delaying retirement as they either lost their nest eggs

* With the glut of applications, it now takes an MA, etc... I wouldn't be surprised if I opened the paper to see an entry level job ad for a janitor that requires a BA and 10 years experience.

What I don't hear anyone talking about is the endgame results of the current situation. What is going to happen in 5 years because of this? In 10 years? In 20 years?

I've yet to see anybody put all these things together. I'm having trouble wrapping my head around it myself. The whole thing just sounds like a recipe for utter economic and political disaster. What happens when an entire generation can't get good jobs and are simultaneously wage slaves? What happens to society when you remove all their earning/spending/scientific/creative/productive potential because they're trapped flipping burgers part time just to keep their heads above debt?

I had around 70 resume submissions in the past month alone

Im off to sign the contract but will return in a couple of hours with my job hunting tips. Again


**Edit**: So I guess after 6 months of searching



1) Stay in Shape - this has been discussed before, you went on a hike this morning? Where did you go"", etc.). You being poor does not mean you cant go on a run, hike, or a nice walk or swim.

2)  Get into a routine - wake up and make it a habit to apply to at least a couple of jobs a day. It's a way to stay sane.

3) Work your network - Keep your ear to the ground

4) Keep LEARNING. - Lynda.com, and youtube are your friends. In my downtime I learned SPSS, SQL, and Spotfire whenever I had some spare time. That's three new skills I got to add to my resume just because I had some free time.

5) Your going to have a ""pity party"" once in a while

6) You have fairly little control over what job your going to get. Case in point

7) Post your resume on r/resumes. Have redditors rip it apart and rebuild it until you start getting responses from employers. I formatted my resume about 10 different times before the fish started biting.

8) No more ""uhms"" during the interview. It makes you sound unsure of yourself. Take a moment to mull the question over.

9) In an interview, spoke a little bit about each bullet point, and then explain how they are relevant to the question and tie it in to a central thesis (if applicable). **Don't ramble**. If the interviewer wants to know more, they will ask.

10) Re-read number 9. Yes

11) Don't feel guilty for taking a break. Sometimes you've fired off so many resume's you lose count. After about 2 weeks of this it gets debilitating. Go grab some (cheap) beers with friends and vent to them. That's what friends are for! They will listen

and most importantly...

12) Don't give up.

Ever since I was probably in the 7th or 8th grade, but I had accumulated several student loans that I could only continue to defer if I went straight into law school, so I did just that.

I'm now almost done with my first year of law school and I've come to the realization that I don't have what it takes to even finish getting through law school, and it's looking like this semester will likely be a repeat of that.

So, I have absolutely no back up plan. Being a lawyer is all I've wanted to do since middle school, so I never planned any sort of contingency. I have a degree in Business, but I honestly don't feel like I know anything about it. I feel like that degree didn't really give me any useable skills.

So, because not only am I 23 and have no idea what to do with my life, I also have a rather large amount of student loan debt racked up between 4 years of undergrad and a year of law school. The only thing I've ever even considered as a back-of-my-mind-day-dream other than law school was doing voice acting, specifically for video games. However, after doing some quick research, that is apparently an incredibly hard industry to break into and, outside of some heavy involvement in the theater program when I was in high school 5 years ago

So

It doesn't make sense.  ,,62,9,35,"I've been out of college for months now and haven't been able to land a job despite quite a few interviews.  I've done all the mock interview nonsense and I always score high

My resume is great, and I have awards and honors as well.  I was also active in volunteering in my time unemployed.  

I just don't get why I'm not hired

I'm not terrible to where they turn me down off the bat

I've had close friends give me an analysis

That and I hate all the fake BS and sometimes it shows.  I admit that I have a very short patience when I recognize that someone is trying to get me to jump through hoops and do the old song and dance.   But I still do my best to upkeep it.  

I'm not someone who is unlikeable though, who end up keeping in touch with me and I do use them in my network.  

**TL;DR:**  So my question would be, when you go to the actual interview they tell you no...

what can you do?  

That and before I was getting interviews left and right

The worst part is seeing others who have jobs, just really good at being dumb and bubbly.  Which would be fine if it was retail or something, not a number crunching finance position.  And no, that is not a generalization that she's dumb and manipulative **SHE AND HER GROUP WERE CAUGHT PLAGIARIZING** off of my roommates final project.  The school let her slide with just an F on the project, and she gets hired over both me and my roommate.....  Why the fuck would companies hire people that are crooks like that and leave the rest of us hanging high and dry.  

On a side note, have good grades, active socially not just within my own group but through clubs and frats and stuff too.  So its not like I'm some smelly socially inept kid that walks into an interview with an oversized suit I bought from JCPenney the day before.

I was thinking on calling directly to their offices, but then again (yes the idea has crossed my mind, if your a crook, you can have false offices and all.  An ex employer whom I asked for help told me he verified that their paying their taxes, but also said that it might be an elaborated hoax.

That is the worst case scenario, I've heard terrifying stories about tech companies that hire Mexican developers, and do not comply with the contracts, stop paying your salary if get out of project, there are pretty worrying clauses in the contract specially one that says that they will sue you by 20k if you get fired or not work for them for 24 continuous months, to pay for their expenses.

In all, I want to see if I can get out of the contract without getting sued and without affecting my tourist visa (I don't care about the NAFTA work visa) and further 'processes' with the US immigration/government.

One of the first things in the contract said something about starting being valid once the employee reports to work.

UPDATE 1:

Yesterday happened a very disgusting thing, but 5 minutes before the it they called me again, and said that they sent me an email, it was a highly modified resume of mine, with a lot of lies, on my experience, tools and such, from one language to another

They even asked me to lie and say that I was already in the US for a month, to which I say nothing out of disgust.

I took the interview, they arranged a meeting between them, me and the company. I gues I'll tell them there I don't want to go with them, see how they react, if they thread me or if they agree to release me without fight because they realize their 'contract' is weak if we go to court.

I just want to be sure that they can't do me anything legally


UPDATE2:

This is the dreaded clause I was telling you about:

Liquidated Damages Prospective Contractor acknowledges that Company, effort and resources. Should Company make an offer to Prospective Contractor to execute an Employment Agreement (defined below) during the Term of this Agreement, and Prospective Contractor refuses, or is unable to execute the Employment Agreement due to other employment obligations or its inability to legally work in the United States,Company shall be entitled to liquidated damages in the sum of $20,000.00, which represents Company’s best estimate of the fees it would have otherwise received from its Client if Prospective Contractor performed his obligations under the offered Employment Agreement.

In the past 3 months we have lost so many employees that the amount of overtime was ridiculous.  I'm in the health care field and we have mandatory forced overtime.

Around twice a week I was being forced to work from 10pm to 5pm the following afternoon and then expected to come back again at 10pm and work until 9am.  

I was burnt out, refusing to hire more staff.  The most recent schedule has over 50 shifts OPEN in the next two weeks and we have barely 60 staff all together (who are of course already working their own normal shifts).

My paycheck on may 5th was not only a week late, but ""had every *intention* of paying me"" what was owed.

I have 3 days worth of pay that will supposedly be on the June 5th paycheck. 

The people running this business are idiots. They have done nearly everything wrong I can think to do (why I left) and I KNOW they LIE to employees to smooth things over and keep them working. I KNOW they owe money all over town as well. I also KNOW that they are indeed **broke**. So the thing about not being able to afford paying my overtime at that moment was probably true. 

However, but it is to me. That's like a months pay in my income bracket. 

So how long should I wait before taking this to court? I can't wait that long

Edit: a word

Edit: **UPDATE**
I called the Washington state department of labor and industries! They said I can submit a formal complaint as early as the day after I was supposed to be paid. Since I have a few hours on a pay check that is due on the 5th of June

With my complaint they encouraged me to send copies of my pay stubs

They said that my (previous) employer will have 60 days to respond to the complaint. If they have not paid me before that time has elapsed

Justice will be done!

I started my job search on June 15th, I can effectively negate the first two weeks of searching because I was using a pretty bad résumé. I was looking for jobs that held steady 9-5 hours so I could continue to pursue my creative endeavors in the evening and not have to worry about wonky scheduling conflicts. Because I had experience as an admin assistant, those were the sorts of jobs for which I was applying. I was using Indeed and Craigslist exclusively.

On July 15th, and I knew I didn't have a lot of money to kick around. I started learning about temp agencies, so I gave them an application. I applied to 3 staffing agencies, which I found through Yelp. One agency never contacted me, and 2 set up interviews. The first interview went okay, but subsequent interactions with the agency (in addition to a lack of work) drove me to stop contacting them. I'm not sure exactly what happened, but when I stopped reporting my availability they just sorta let me drop off without another word.

The second agency

August came and went and I was still doing some short assignments with my recruiter, the owner and I, on the first of September, and by the following Friday I had been hired on as a data entry and admin support position. The company is exactly what I wanted - small, flexible, nice, and progressive. My first week of work was like a dream come true!

I had one other interview, however, only made me want the first job more. Lucky me, I think I tanked the second interview (possibly on purpose) and got offered the first job.

I'm so far past cloud nine right now

It turned out to be quite different from my expectations. I believe a lot of people are in the same boat. 

I have an idea for a website that will showcase daily activities for a variety of professions. For example, picking out lightbulbs, etc. If you're interested in the design part of architecture but then found out that most of the time you're actually doing paperwork, then you might think twice about pursuing this path.

- Keep your resume active on search sites. Recruiters generally search for ""new resumes today""
- Don't craft a resume and stop. This was my big mistake. If you're not getting calls, change the length. Change the amount of detail. Try resumes targeted towards different jobs (sales, writing code, DBA, etc)
- Try different things in your resume. Remember when your resume coach or whoever said ""keep it professional""? Fuck that. Just for the hell of it I changed my resume to a one-pager with pictures of the covers of my books. That got me a **ton** of phone calls from recruiters who would then say ""your resume doesn't say a lot about your experience - do you have a more detailed one?"" 
- Try everything. If the phone's not ringing
- When recruiters do call
- Apply for every job you can find. I ended up with about a dozen resumes for different jobs and different perspectives. Sometimes I just chose one at random to send in. 
- Always write a cover letter. If there's not much of a job description
- Be honest. If you have a disqualifying factor for some jobs, they're more likely to go shuffle through their files for you. 
- If you're a fast learner, keep a window to Google open - you never know when just a glance at a word the interviewer is using is enough to knock something loose.

My point of view is for jobs in a professional setting

This is still a simplified view of the process

Job Req - One way or another a manager has a job opening.  This might be a new position or an opening due to an employee leaving the team for any reason.  The best are due to internal job transfers and new positions.  Part of my job as a hiring manager is to not lose the job req.  In larger companies sometimes not filling the position fast enough will mean losing the position.  This is where temps and contractors are helpful when needed.  ""Try before you buy""...

Job Description - Someone creates a description of the job and the required duties.  This is usually done by the hiring manager.  At this point

Resume Collection - Resumes come into recruiters via postings, or sometimes the hiring manager.  Some recruiters will collect a number of resumes and send them all at once, and some send them in as they come in.  Recruiters only want to forward on qualified resumes.  They look for keywords, experience at similar companies with similar titles, and any other guidance they have been given.  The recruiters work really hard to only forward resumes that are at least close to being a good fit.  

This is the first stage of why it is SO important to explain how YOU can do the job that was posted.  Recruiters do not care if their name was on the cover letter.  They want to know the hiring manager won't complain that the resumes they receive are crap.

[Agencies] - Here is my small pitch for Agencies.  If an agency has a history of success with a company

Hiring manager resume review - [me] Depending on what is going on resumes are reviewed as they come in or in batches.  Out of everyone in the process I have the most leeway to determine what happens next and how fast it happens.  My only goal in reviewing resumes is to determine if you have the potential to do the job I have available.  Depending on the role

The review process of resumes can last anywhere between a few seconds to a couple minutes.  There is a rhythm developed after reviewing a few thousand resumes.  Staying with the industry standards for the format will only benefit you.

With enough experience the hiring manager will know what resumes are worth following up on.  It's very hard to explain, it is easy to see that you might be a good fit.  I am not hiring for someone who is good at writing resumes  (usually).  

Just keep in mind

I know that to build a good team

* ***Catalogue your activities***

During my job search

- *Date of application*
- *Company*
- *Position applied for*
- *Industry Sector*
- *Location City*
- *Location State*
- *Method of Application (e.g. Linkedin/Email/Monster/Etc)*
- *Did I save a custom cover letter? (Yes/No)*
- *Contact Name of Hiring Manager/HR*
- *Any other Notes on Job*

This cataloguing of the jobs ensured that I could look back each day and each week to see if I was hitting my metrics in job applications.  Generally I'd aim for 6 - 8 *GOOD* job applications each day. I'll get into what I would classify as a *GOOD* job application shortly.  The process takes about 2 minutes per job



* ***Location Specific Resumes***

This is a tricky area.  If you're looking for a job local to the city you're in

When I got to the US (and before I arrived)

Make Resumes for the 5 places you'd like to live the most.  Use friend's addresses or random places off 
google maps (if you're anxious about using someone's address look up a house for rent on trulia and use that instead.  Then make a blank one (no address) for places that fall outside of your target cities.  Use the appropriate resume and in your cover letter

If locations were not within the 5 cities picked


* ***Custom Cover Letters***

I got this down to a fine art by the end of my application process!  Every job that I applied for, or tongue in cheek with it).


* ***Unique Resume + Online Profile***


With the prevalence of internet applications

//**EDIT 1 **: One of the early things I discovered in this process is that different employers have different requirements, the employer also asks for a .txt version or word version of the resume.  I'm an Adobe InDesign guy, so my resume was done in InDesign and then .pdf'ed, but I maintained a .txt and also a word version that I could use if they didn't accept my .pdf   Also, make sure to keep under 500kb because for some reason they mostly didn't allow attachments any larger.//

Anything you can do to set yourself apart is vitally important. I have had two recruiters tell me that ""my resume was just so different they couldn't stop coming back to it"". I had used interesting fonts and some graphical design elements that were non-standard, and using the right keywords can make a big difference.


One easy tip here also is to buy a domain of your last name (if its unique) or something relevant to yourself but professional

Personally


 PM me if you'd like linking to my resume and I'll happily do so.


* ***Multiple Touch Points***

This is a KEY factor to getting somewhere with your job search.

Sites such as Linkedin allow you to often identify who the HR manager and the Hiring Manager are in any particular company.  Sending them a note to say hello and introduced yourself is a very good way to stand out from the pack. My success rate with Linkedin ""inmails"" is probably 25% responses

Consider paying the $20 a month for premium on linkedin because you can send up to 5 InMails a month (might be 10 actually?), I always looked on LinkedIn with preference when job searching as my primary site. After exhausting linkedin each day, I'd generally troll Indeed's huge number of added jobs (as they amalgamate a lot of sites).  I would also occasionally check through all the industry company's in my target sector (this is longwinded and boring but can pull up jobs fewer people have applied for because for whatever reason they fell between the cracks) 

If you can figure out their email format, they'll probably have redirects that work with this naming convention. Check the email contact of a press release article by the company and use this naming convention when you ID the hiring manager and/or HR manager!



* ***Networking IRL***

I've seen a few posts on here from people saying that you should tell EVERYONE YOU KNOW that you're looking for a job.  While this might not be a bad idea, you're going to have to get by on your merits a bit more.

If you can afford it or live close to a city where they take place, then let them know you're shopping around for a job in that industry.  Its amazing how many nice people you can meet at trade shows, and people are much more receptive there than anywhere else.  For some of the very large companies, this can be one of the only ways of really getting a foot in the door.

If you work in a specific industry and apply for a job, interest in the industry, and convenience for the manager because they'll already be at the event.

Another piece of advice here is bring business cards + examples of work.  Resumes get lost and forgotten at trade shows because they don't fit in a pocket with the wad of other cards.  If you think your resume will get kept by the guy... it may do

After meeting someone at a trade show, this will bring the meeting back into their mind quickly.

1330795732.0,qg278,My personal job hell,NecrotizingTissue,59,10,40,"Throw-away.

I'm 45 years old

I dropped out of college after three years.  The Engineering program was too tough for me

I got a job in a sign-making shop at the college

In the late 1980's

After awhile other shops started coming to me for their tech needs, and all the little guys like me were transferred to a large support team under his direction.  

With this centralization came specialization.  Before the change, providing end-user support.  After, all I did was write code.

Our new manager aggressively started hiring top-notch talent.  Experienced systems programmers from big-name tech firms with well-regarded

So now, and though by and large this fact isn't mentioned, it's made plain in other ways.

We have two department meetings a week: Monday mornings to plan the week and Thursday afternoons to report our progress.  Each meeting is a new slice of hell, since I've been working on modifying a particularly tricky bit of code of one of the other guys.  The guys are generally a well-heeled polite bunch but I can see the subtle expression changes and uncomfortable tension in the room, a veiled mixture of pity and distaste.

This feeling of professional inadequacy plagues me every day.  Some days, and then Friday through Sunday escalates similarly as another week in hell approaches.

The environment at my college is pretty forgiving, they could give me the axe at any time, and I wait for it to fall. I know that I don't belong there, and I have thought about - even fantasized - about changing my career, or at least taking another job more in line with my capabilities.  But Fear and Rationalization keep me there.

Each day I live with this oppressive undercurrent of inadequacy and dread of my workplace, which I mostly save in anticipation of the axe, which could (and by rights should) come at any time.

Although I have hinted at my situation with my one or two friends/acquaintances and family, their intuitions will be confirmed, and my already questionable esteem in their eyes with fall even further.

My more impulsive thoughts welcome the axe.  Losing my job would turn the page and provide some hope for personal redemption and fulfillment in my remaining years

Firstly, for 2 weeks anyway) in a job that I HATE with the deepest, most burning passion. Anyway, the first thing I did was seek out education resources to help me get started in a new field. I completed a 10-month training course at a local technical college in an industry specific (oil and gas) program. I finished that program in December.

Before I finished the program, but I utilized the people that were part of the program, and some of those leads led to others. I started sending out my resume way before I actually finished my certification. I made a couple of direct HR contacts, and sent my resume to those places as well. 

One day while trying to think of other places to look for job listings, but the industry has a local chapter of professional membership, and they have dinner meetings and stuff. Anyway, they had a jobs section posted on their website as well, and I found a listing that matched my skills and fired off an email to the department manager (Bypassing HR! Yay!).

About a month and a half and 2 interviews later

So

* New training is good. Especially when switching careers.
* Networking does help
* Submitting applications to webforms on company websites is pretty much worthless.
* Look for outside-the-box places for job postings. This job wasn't posted anywhere else except the associations website.
* Patience, but it all turned out great in the end.

I have a B.A. in film and video studies and had the opportunity to use my skills to make web videos as a part of a marketing and promotions team as a temp for 1.5 years until the position ended and other marketing employees with less video production experience but greater marketing experience took over the role. I enjoy making videos have not kept my skills fresh.  

Since then, a September-February, and a September to December. Teaching is really cool, but as someone from a family of teachers I cannot see the merit of returning to school to get a teachable major and credentials (2-3 years) for the return on investment, especially as public education becomes more and more about teaching how to test well.  I have also worked as a student supervisor at a recreation facility (3 yrs) , taught swimming lessons (many years), been an assistant at a non-profit (over summer) , and assisted with computer sales for a popular computer company (1 year).  

Because I am a contract sub I am given ""reasonable assurance"" of employment for the following fall and will not receive unemployment if I quit, or how long it will last.  My #1 goal is have steady employment that would allow me to move out of my parent's  basement.  I would like to achieve this as soon as possible, but recognize that more education may serve me well either before or after landing another job. 

I've applied for work as an administrative assistant, feeling like more work is not just around the corner. 
I like being active on the job if possible, speak, and train.  In college I did not know what to major in and waffled along without a goal until I found a major I could succeed at while working. In high school I was good at science and math, but did better with languages and art.  My LinkedIn network has endorsed me for: Editing, Video Editing, Reliability, Public Speaking, Teaching, and Social Media. 

I'm open to anything: suggestions of what skills I need to get hired now
Thanks in advance!

I was getting ready to drive on an overnight 4 hour (each way) trip this day.


-------------------


It began when I show up for work Monday morning to find the owners wife standing there in the parking lot. I think I've seen her face to face a dozen times

She starts looking at me, I'm half owner now"" (remember the other partner left). At this point I'm floored, so I look for comic relief (it's the way I keep my shit together) and turn to my co-worker and state ""Good, we need supervision!"". As if she was waiting for this she shoots an openly hostile ""are you being smart with me!?"" I reply that I am not... I was, but it wasn't helpful so I retreat.

At this point I can tell I need to remove myself from the situation - remember

I pretend to forget the keys to my work truck

I call the owner (husband) and ask him

My shoulders slump. I tell him that if there is anything else I can do today I'd like to switch. I can't work with her - she is openly hostile towards me and I can't see spending a 4 hour car ride with her as a constructive thing to do. He says that she's an employee of this company and I'll work with here or I'm fired. 

I don't think he was ready to hear me say ""ok then"" and accept the termination


**TL;DR: Small company - owners openly hostile wife now my supervisor and there is nothing I can do about it - pull rip cord - Win! (sort of)**

EDIT: clarification

EDIT 2: Lots of talk of me having balls to do this - please don't put yourself in this situation. As mentioned in this post

**WTF EDIT : just received a weird letter certified FEDex.**

READS: (some info replaced with placeholder)

this is to confirm your termination with COMPANY inc. effective TIME this morning.

***RIGHT NOW***: Get a LinkedIn account. Create a full profile. Add everyone you know. Keep it fresh - spend some time there every week. Join groups and participate. Build your network - it's better to have a safety net *before* you lose your job. 

- The first day you're unexpectedly jobless
- Be open with the whole family. Tell the kids you don't have a job, warn them immediately that it may be an austere Christmas. 
- Cancel/downsize EVERYTHING. Drop your TV service (cable/satellite). Cut back on your cell phone service as much as possible. If you have kids and they've got unlimited text or data plans
- If you're a convenience food family (hot pockets, chicken, pork, etc, and spend some time in the kitchen than buying frozen crap. 
- Quit soda &amp; beer. Drink water. It's better for you anyway. 
- Stop renewing magazines. 
- Review your entire household budget. Get two months of bank records and look at where your money goes. Start slashing. 
- Review all your automated payments. You probably want to cancel them all and go to writing checks (switch to a credit union if your asshole bank charges for checks). Nothing like having a finely crafted plan to keep a bunch of creditors happy get wiped out by an automated mortgage payment that could've waited a month. 
- Call all your creditors and tell them you're unemployed. Ask about structured payment plans or forbearance options. You may not need to go there on day one
- Always answer the phone to talk to creditors. Talking to them and telling them you're unemployed will always result in a better situation than ducking phone calls. 
- Cancel every credit card possible
- Replacing a transmission costs $4
- While you want to go as austere as possible
- If you were a one-income family and your kids are relatively self-sufficient

Essentially

Job hunting:  

- Get accounts on every job board. Update your resume *every day.* Recruiters generally look at resumes posted in the last 24 hours. 
- If the phone isn't ringing
- Hiring *sucks* in the winter. If you're jobless after Halloween
- If your experience is a bit broad
- Write cover letters. They're stupid
- If your expertise lends itself towards online expression
- If you are only getting a few calls, it lets you keep your interviewing skills fresh. But take the first job you can, even if it pays 3/4 what you're used to. Because it's still more than you're making otherwise. 
- Don't job hop. If you *do* grab an underpaying job early
- Keep a calendar on your desk. First of all it's handy for scheduling interviews
- Be proactive. After going through job sites and ensuring your resume is up to date, send a well-written targeted cover letter and resume to a hiring manager and to their recruiter. They may have a job req that's not posted yet, or they may remember you when they have an opening. Bottom line is that it doesn't cost you anything to do this. 
- If you're interviewing for suit-type jobs
- Get a copy of [""Selling to VITO""](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1580622240?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=andmyaxe-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1580622240 ""Amazon Associates link thingy""). It's about the sales approach to access executives
- Just my personal experience

- Stay on a regular schedule. If you're a night owl
- Your job search should take the morning. After lunch, work with new tools, etc.

When I leave, however, the editor-in-chief has been laying blame on me for things that aren't even remotely my fault (e.g. two typos in the headlines of another section made it to print? Totally timeofthedecade's fault).

I'm going to leave my letter of resignation (carefully written to avoid even mentioning why I'm leaving) on my boss's desk as soon as he okays my pages

Thanks, but I can't stay here and be abused, devalued, disrespected, and harassed at this job anymore.

The second candidate didn't wear a suit, she seemed eager and like she learned quickly. I though we'd work we'll together based on personality. 

The third candidate was my boss' favorite and she was well-suited for the job. She seemed competent and nice, and I think she'd do the job fine.

By the time the last candidate came in I was pretty sure I was already hiring the second one. But, but she seemed eager to learn and had some ideas I wouldn't have thought of myself. I think she'll be a good balance for me even though I don't see us being friends outside of work. We didn't have much in common besides liking what we do.

I have a Bachelor's degree, a cashier, and dish help for 6 months. Then I got a job at a retail store where I did just about everything in the store. I opened and closed most days, did office management, handled warranties and returns, gave superb customer service, etc. I did that for 3 and a half years. After that I got a job shortly after graduating college at a publishing company where I worked for 11 months as a children's book illustrator

I'm not sure what

Well, where I was miserable. I am a great employee and great with customers, but I really hate doing customer service work in a retail store. I hate the hours, working weekends and evenings and not seeing my friends and family. I really, really don't want to go back to retail hours and experiences for a job.

Is that all I have?

Unfortunately, despite me being willing to learn. My college experience was great but because I wanted to stay close to home I didn't get the experience needed for specific skills or software to be in the industry I want to be in. I plan to go back wither for a Master's or at least to take specific skills and get experience with the programs I need (for example: Maya or Flash). The problem is, I don't have the money to go back to school. I went through my first college experience without racking up any debt, and I refuse to take loans and do so for my second bout.

I am planning on moving in a few years to a place that has the industry I want to get into more heavily

I am looking into administrative type jobs, but no one seems to be interested in hiring me for that.

I thought I was going to get hired into a bank, etc). He ended up getting a job there, and I haven't heard back from them in 3 weeks now. It's safe for me to assume they don't want me. I am just really depressed about this whole thing.

What is wrong with me or my resume or whatever that I can't get a job? I don't blame my friend for wanting to leave his job at Wal-Mart, I never did, but it's necessary for me to pay for my rent and car payments. I would rather have a job. I am working with tons of recruitment agencies that aren't doing a damn thing to help me find a job, despite my constant emails to them. I am applying to more than the required number of job searches each week to look for a job.

* Networking: *Check*. I was contacted by them because a mutual colleague had passed on my résumé to them.

* Researching the Company: *Check*. This was actually pretty easy

* Thank You Notes: *Check*. Since I had to come back so many times

* Follow-Up: *Check*. There would be some long periods in between some of the interviews

* Equally Listen as Much as You Speak. *Check*

* Always Be On Time. *Check*


Additional Advice:

* Be enthusiastic about your industry. Not just wanting to work within it

* Bring a notebook. Taking notes will help you remember what you discussed so you can bring it up in your thank you note. It'll also help you remember any additional questions you may have.

* Remember everyone that you meet. The receptionists at this particular company happened to be twins

* Dress to impress and have a firm handshake. I was complimented on both of these: first impressions are everything.

* Prepare for anything. I live in the city and it's the dead of summer. It comes as a bit of a challenge to find something nice to wear but light enough so you don't get sweat stains. I packed with me: a washcloth to wipe down excess sweat, an extra shirt, and an umbrella.

A couple of weeks ago

I have talked to a few friends in the business world (These are big name companies too) who stated that it would be a great position and that I really need to make myself noticed.  All recommended sending the company an updated resume geared more towards the position.  

A side note - I am very well qualified for the position and I wanted them to see this.  My other resume did not really show my skills related to this specific job.

So late last week I sent a short e-mail to the administrator who I was told was doing the interviewing and just expressed my interest in the position and wanted to drop her an updated resume/reference sheet

The next day after sending the e-mail, and was able to still get me an interview.

I would answer her questions, I needed to apologize to myself.  She didn't give a rats ass if I got the job"" after this.

I was led to believe that my name would be given to the company and this would be the last I have ever heard from the staffing agency.  I have always heard that you need to make yourself stand out

Well in the end, but I am trying to figure out what I did wrong here.  It has been a number of years since I have had to interview for a new job, so my question is, is it no longer a good thing to put yourself out there to be noticed? 

Maybe I am trying to make myself feel better

I have been battling severe depression for the last 15 months and only now the fog is kind of lifting. I was towards the end of my PhD when my depression struck and as I was hospitalized for about 8 months I had to take an extended leave of absence. My professor was nice enough to allow me to finish when I got better but the project unfortunately was in a very competitive field and my results have already been published by a competing lab. So I have been suggested to write up my thesis without any publications as that is accepted here for a getting a degree. I have a lot of laboratory experience and also have been the elected representative of my graduate school and have been the head of an organizing committee which has successfully organized international symposiums for 3 years with prestigious speakers from around the world including Noble Laureates.

My depression was the result of certain repressed memories from my childhood (sexual abuse by my older sibling and cousin) making an unwelcome appearance in the conscious part of my brain. I went through intensive trauma therapy and had to work very hard to get back to my 'normal' life. 

Now that I am trying to pick up the pieces of my life I find myself in a ridiculous position where suddenly my career does not seem as bright

I feel like I am done with being in the lab 24/7. the past 15 months have obviously changed me as a person and my research which was a very big part of my life is no longer something I identify with. I no longer see myself doing a postdoc and working in academia and discovering brilliant things in my field. It was a very hard decision but I realized that I don't want to spend the next 10 years in a lab. Having said that I still love science and cannot imagine leaving the field altogether. I have an excellent bachelors degree and two masters degrees and lot of experience in labs around Europe.

The things that still make me happy are editing my colleagues/students written works as well as promoting the exchange of ideas between scientists or students not just within my discipline but across the varied fields of science.  

I would love to join either a scientific journal/publishing house or manage an international graduate school. This is where I need your help Redittors

***First a bit of background information***

Im a 25 year old bloke living in England and I feel at a complete loss.
I left college with a few A levels to my name and never made it to university due to some personal issues with family at home ( I pretty much needed to go into employment during college time to help keep the family going)
After college ended I shifted my part time retail job into full time and moved out of my parents house as soon as possible

Since then I've bounced around from job to job (closures and redundancies have kinda tore the place apart) making sure I always had money coming in to support but not really getting anywhere long term.

Fast forward to now and there is only one big employer left in my small town
The pay is not actually terrible for the responsibilities given but the work is the most mind numbing that I have ever encountered (and this is someone that spent 2 years working tills in retail in a small population town for 9 hours a day) and to top it off my boss is ludicrously incompetent.

Typical comments from her include :
""I'm moving you to 10pm finishes because we all need to pull together for the good of the department
and
""Sometimes I need to make an example of staff just to make sure that everyone is kept in check - and this time it's you""
And this is some of the tamer stuff.

Of course I've made complaints and asked to be moved around but the level of managers above her dont give 2 shits as long as the numbers from the department come through okay (which they do because we actually ARE efficient at our job despite how miserable we are made to feel for it) and in order to move departments you need to have a positive recommendation from your current team lead - something she will never give because she knows she wouldn't be able to get away with half the shit she pulls on me towards other more 'respectable' members of staff.

To make it worse we were all asked to voluntarily change our contracts to allow us to work any time between 7am in the morning and 11pm at night, gym schedules, poker nights and 6 a side soccer twice a week I flat refused, allowing work to have control over my private life was just one step too far! 
But of course after i failed to volunteer i was taken into an office and basically shouted into changing it, basically do it or you dont have a job.
Not being an idiot and wanting to still have a job

Now i'm trapped - I have a wonderful girlfriend of 7 years who I dont get t spend any time with because her normal shift pattern is the direct opposite of the ones i normally get put on. We have our own flat which I NEED to stay in employment for us to keep

There are no other recruiters in the area and every other job i've applied for has either been a step sideways or I have not got it.

I'm done taking jobs solely because they are not the place i'm at right now

***Now on to the actual question.***

As much as I hate this place I am not an idiot, both of these things are hobbies I do in my spare time and have a lot of home taught experience in IT maintenance and networking, but without any real qualifications in those areas convincing an employer that I'm worth their attention even for an interview is hard.
I've considered going back to college and brushing up on my skills - but I cant take time out from work

Does anyone have any advice on what I can do to make myself more employable or brush up in these areas? After being in the 9-5 (if im lucky) for the past 9 years I feel genuinely out of the game and want to do anything i can

I understand that we can't all have jobs that we want

Fifty applications and 10 interviews later, and they were super understanding about the reason I gave. I start tomorrow and couldn't be more excited!

Even though I've had a hard time being unemployed these last couple months, I would come home every night and cry. I was making the most money I have ever made in my life, but I never wanted to go out. It really messed with my self esteem, too, being told that I wasn't worth the $19/hr my ex-boss was paying me even though he was charging his clients $105/hr for my services.

Now, and you'll get one too,"" but these tips really helped me and I feel obligated to pass them on. 

1.) Dress for the part! The night before an important interview, blue button-down, and blue scarf. I made sure my shoes were shined and my backpack was clean and went to bed. The next morning, I started to freak out because my outfit wasn't really professional enough for a corporate attorneys' office. So, just hours before my interview, I picked out a conservative black pencil skirt, white button-down, and then I topped it off with nylons and a professional tote that fit all my paperwork. The whole outfit cost me a fair amount

2.) Thank you letters! For every interview I had (even phone interviews), and then I sent them--in addition to the receptionist who gave me all their information--a thank you card. Granted, I didn't get a second interview with them (the job was seriously out of my league considering my experience level), but they made sure to call me soon after and let me know they appreciated my thoughtfulness.

3.) Further your skills! I was getting very restless staying at home every day filling out applications, and they paid for $200 of the $275 I needed. Even though I already had a lot of design experience before this, taking the class helped me learn more about the little bells and whistles of the program, it got me out of the house, it allowed me to build up my portfolio, and it showed my new employer that I am self-motivated.

4.) De-stress! This one is so hard to do when you don't have the funds. When I'm unemployed, my favorite local bar has $2 Tuesdays. So, instead of going out with friends on Friday and Saturday, I would go out Tuesday nights, have a drink or two, and then invite my friends to make food with me at home on the weekends. And this brings me to my last suggestion:

5.) Let your friends help you! I have always been very self-sufficient to the point that it is difficult for me to accept help. But when you find yourself unemployed, others sacrificed going out for staying in, and my SO really showed his support by offering to move into my 1br apartment with me for awhile so that I could afford rent. It made me feel really special to see their kindness in action, and now that I have a job, I will be sure to pay it back (and forward).

My rejection for the Sales Management Trainee said they were going to pursue candidates whose qualifications more closely match their needs... What could I possibly be lacking for a TRAINEE position?

1348639692.0,10htwq,Just received an offer for a great job :D,kittymojo,51,11,9,"Had to come and share my happy.

I really love my current job and would have loved to have stayed but have had such severe problems with my immediate manager (hired after me) that I have actually been battling clinical depression and anxiety attacks for the last 10 months

Had an interview on Monday with a fantastic NFP organisation supporting people with mental illness (something I have experienced so it means a lot to me) - I had a great interview and cemented it with killer references. Had my references checked yesterday and the job offer today. Just gave my notice and feel lighter and better and happier than I have in MONTHS.

Have also hooked myself up with 11 days off between jobs so time for a MUCH needed break for me. This has been a tough year.

Edit: 

My methods (I am in a very lucky situation

* Be lucky enough to live somewhere with a good job market.
* Already be employed.
* Have a killer resume highlighting my achievements in past roles.
* Have EXCELLENT references who are informed of my resume's contents
* Write great cover letters that sell you as a candidate
* Address Key Selection Criteria scrupulously - 200-500 words per item, Result model
* Use KSC to collate examples/stories to address the same points in interview (interviews often re-phrase the same points as questions)
* Apply for appropriate work - the better the fit of what you apply for the more likely you are to get it
* Apply when you are feeling good about yourself - when I am down I don't have ANYWHERE near the same level of confidence and don't do as well.
* Be yourself in interviews - no point them hiring someone that you aren't going to be able to be all the time.
* Research the organisation well
* Have good questions to ask them - use this to end your interview on a positive note",,t5_2qhnd,1348791980.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/10htwq/just_received_an_offer_for_a_great_job_d/

1330998378.0,qjh0f,[Another update to] Boss threw a hissy fit.,Salmontha,50,8,20,"Most of you saw this coming after I posted two weeks ago: http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pvo7g/long_update_boss_threw_a_hissy_fit_and_humiliated/. I was fired last week.

After my last post, talked to my ex-boss. Apparently he confided in her and, without saying these words exactly, he told her that he planned to fire me later that day. He could tell by her reaction that she wasn't happy about that, and he really respects her, so after a long conversation, he agreed that he would keep me on and stick to the original plan of making me salaried with benefits. He called me into his office later that day and told me all this (although not about the nearly firing me part). We agreed to work on communicating better from there on out.

That was a week ago last Friday. I went home that day feeling like my job was safe and that my ex-boss and I were turning over a new leaf. But I was very wrong.

Now for a little more background: I was paid on an hourly basis for my probationary period. Everyone else in the office was salaried and got comp time. When I first started, the 28th, as I was gathering employee hour totals from my coworkers to do payroll, I asked my ex-boss if I could count 8 of the 30+ hours I had saved as comp time toward the day off we had for President's Day. Everyone else in the office got holiday pay, but as I did not yet have benefits, I thought I could use my comp hours. I asked my ex-boss, and he said he would have to think about it.

The next day, my boss still did not talk to me about becoming salaried. He was going on vacation beginning at noon on the 29th, so I knew I had to ask him about it again before that. He told me the week before that if he did not sign me up for insurance by March 1st, I would have to wait until August 1st. So, at the end of the day on Wednesday, I asked my ex-boss if it was a good time to chat, and he said yes. First, as an hourly employee, but then he explained that he was going to take the chance anyways and hope his investment (i.e.

The next morning, no, it wasn't. I was holding a contract that, if I signed, would make me a part-time, on-call introductory employee. The contract stated that I failed my introductory period (again, the only example my ex-boss had of me being a shitty employee was the binder incident) and that I would have to go through another one. And, work 30 hours or fewer per week. I asked my ex-boss if this was negotiable at all, they would be cancelled. When I asked if my hours would be cut

I told my ex-boss that I didn't think this was a part-time job and that the editing aspect alone was a full-time job. And then I mentioned that I hadn't said anything about my workload when the research analyst quit and I absorbed all her duties. He snatched the memorandum out of my hands

Now that I've had a few days to recuperate, which is a huge improvement. All that being said, though, I have no idea how I start my new job search because now I have to explain why my last job ended. I'm not stupid enough to use my ex-boss as a reference, but still, how do I explain getting fired? I can't trash his management style or say it was a hostile work environment without sounding like a whining quitter. And it doesn't make sense to say that I love to edit but also thought it was time to find other opportunities. So how the heck can I explain what happened? Is there a positive spin to all this that I'm missing?

On another note, I spoke to a woman who quit while I was there, and she told me that my ex-boss has been sued numerous time by employees. But is it a terrible idea for me to pursue this? If I win, I'll be the girl who sued her last employer. If I lose, I'll be the girl who tried to sue her last employer. Either way, isn't this worse than being fired in the first place, at least in the eyes of my next employer?

Which brings me to my last question. My ex-boss hasn't yet paid me for 10 of my overtime hours. (By the way, which would've been last Friday.

1329710584.0,pxbly,Some tips from a recent graduate,stvhlt,50,6,14,"Hi guys

I just started my first ""real"" job after graduating in June of last year with degrees in Econ and Math. I've learned a lot from this subreddit and I thought I'd give back and share some of the things I've picked up during my job search:

1) Don't be lazy with your resume. You should constantly be looking for ways to make it better. Make sure you get feedback on it from friends and family and places like r/resumes. Keep it concise and don't make it longer than a page. Also don't send out the same generic resume to every single job posting you apply to. You really need to tweak it for every type of job you're applying for.

2) Take advantage of your contacts. Make sure that everyone you know is aware that you're looking for a job. You'd be surprised by how many people are willing to let you know if they hear of an opening. I got my current job because a friend of a friend sent in my resume. Out of the 25 or so jobs I applied to through a contact

3) Don't stay at home all day -- try to get out and do stuff. Look for places to volunteer or try to find a part-time job. The first few months after graduation I spent 90% of my time at home and I eventually started getting super depressed. There were days when I would barely get out of bed. But I eventually got a job as a server and it helped a ton. Yeah

4) Spend as much time as you can preparing for every interview. You really need to spend lots and lots of time looking up potential interview questions, etc. It's insanely hard to get an interview. But once you do you're way closer to getting the job. Don't waste the opportunity.

I really hope this helps. Good luck!",,t5_2qhnd,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/pxbly/some_tips_from_a_recent_graduate/
1328759769.0,phau6,Boss threw a hissy fit and humiliated me in front of my coworkers.,Salmontha,51,11,39,"I started working for a small firm 2.5 months ago. I love the work itself and my coworkers

Anyway, we had to send out an important proposal involving two documents: one made up of four binders and another only two sheets of paper. The whole thing was very particular, and if something went wrong, it was my head because I'm in charge of production. I knew the deadline was coming up a couple weeks ago, and I'm in charge of ordering office supplies on top of my main duties, so I purchased binders and tabs and restocked the drawer of Fed Ex supplies. The day before we sent it out, I printed the eight CD labels I needed, I did everything I possibly could have done in order to prepare for the next day.

My boss wanted to send the document out Monday afternoon via Fed Ex even though it wasn't technically due until Wednesday afternoon. By Monday morning, and then he left the office for two hours. During that time, I fixed the glaring errors he neglected to check for, and I assembled the document accordingly. Two hours later, everything was put together, but I ran into a slight problem: the four-binder proposal had to be sealed in its own box, separate from the two-page proposal. However

Just as I was brainstorming my options, he asked me in an annoyed tone if I was finished. I told him I was but that I was about to look for another box to fit the binders in. At this point, we had 2 hours to call Fed Ex for a pickup or 3.5 if I wanted to drop it off at the store. But my boss went ballistic. He tore apart the supply closet, taking out obviously-too-small envelopes and trying to stuff four binders in them. While he was doing this, I suggested that I try to fit the binders in a medium Fed Ex box and then stuff that inside a large Fed Ex box so the two proposals could be sealed separately. (That was going to be my first step before he came in.) But he didn't listen. He kept tearing apart the office and swearing very loudly all the while. And that's when things got nasty. As he was going on his rampage, I was picking up all the ripped envelopes he threw all over the floor, and then he started screaming at me.

""You didn't prepare for this!""

""This should've been taken care of yesterday!""

""What have you been doing all week?!""

""Are you fucking crazy?!"" (This one was after I asked if we could send the two proposals separately; the guidelines only said they had to be sealed separately

At this point, and all was well. However, then my boss came to my desk, told me ""You're lucky that fit,"" and then proceeded to joke about how ridiculous the proposal guidelines were with my coworker three feet away. 

He did not apologize then or since. At this point

So, I have zero respect for my boss. And it's really difficult to take orders from someone you don't respect.

On a similar note, I am the youngest one in the office, the only unmarried person, and the only employee fresh out of college, but don't I deserve basic human respect? I don't need him to like me, but I want to be spoken to with common courtesy, and when something is out of my control

So what do you think? Should I confront him about it? Move on? Any other advice? Also

This morning I woke up to a voicemail from the interviewer asking me to give them a call. I have no idea what to do if I'm offered the job. Here's my basic logic:

1) The job is great for me because I'd be dealing more with people I connect strongly with.

2) I am intimidated by one portion of the job that is kind of ""behind the scenes."" Without drowning you in details, but I'm afraid they're expecting more of me than I can deliver.

3) I don't want to burn any bridges. I took the job I have now saying I expected to be here for more than a year, but would probably reflect poorly on me for leaving like this.

1345779153.0,yqh45,Job hunting success! Advice inside since this is my 3rd job in about a year.,cupcakeplus,55,19,33,"Hi r/jobs. I've been on here for sometime trying to draw some comfort. I'm ~1 year our of college so not seasoned and already on my 3rd job. I was basically laid off twice (amazing luck). My new job may be temporary but at least it's something.

I've learned a lot about job hunting after doing it so much. 1st job was 100+ applications. 2nd job ~90. This job ~80. I am not an engineer or a comp sci major. People never begged me to work for them when I graduated. Job hunting IS a full time job with overtime.

So what I've learned or at least what's worked for me!

* One size fits all resumes and cover letters work. I've spent about half an hour before customizing cover letters and never received a response ever.
* Following up 1 week later works. Yes
* Stalking people works. Can't get a company to talk to you? Stalk their employees on Linkedin! I don't mean creepily but generally showing interest in a company. Plus you're getting to know people in your field. All you awkward penguins can at least email right?
* Keeping very good records of who you contacted and when will help you so much. I have a giant spreadsheet (which is why I can give accurate numbers on the jobs I've applied to) on who I've contacted. I don't accidentally end up emailing the same company
* Spam works. Find every company you'd be willing to work for and send your resume any way you can. People of course are best. I have yet to work somewhere that posted an opening! That's right! None of my jobs have had openings listed. I just used google and went at it. Eventually someone says yes.

* Sometimes it is honestly a blessing if you lose you job. No like seriously. Straight out of college it really is take what you can get. I didn't start out making much. It took a few months before I could live comfortably. Changing jobs is the fastest way to make more money by asking for more at your next position. Best part is you aren't a job hopper because it isn't your fault you were laid off.

tl;dr: Generic cover letters, spam and crazy record keeping help the job hunt so much. ",,False,,t5_2qhnd,False,,

It's enough to turn a smart, but I've hated the company pretty much since starting (only took it because I was desperate for a full time job) and have been in various stages of the job hunt for years. It's draining. And all the advice out there can be confusing.

1338142149.0,u7ij1,Exit interviews - where's the line between being honest and burning bridges?,TurdMurder,40,1,45,"I am about to put in my two weeks notice this coming week after being with a very miserable group of a large company for almost two years. I've been nothing but polite and obedient while there, I'd like to be honest so upper management can see the group has major issues.

Points I would like to touch on in the exit interview:

* The annual review system is flawed. I was told by my manager ""We do not give out Exceeds Expectations ratings unless you're getting promoted"". What's my incentive to give EE-level performance if I know I will not get the proper acknowledgement?
* Lack of proper feedback. I was not told about any areas needing improvement verbally or in writing in my review yet I only received the minimum increase. I cannot develop professionally without proper feedback on how to better myself within the company.
* No respect for our personal lives. Vacation requests submitted 30 days in advance as required by group policy were frequently lost or forgotten about. I've received phone calls on days of my personal time off asking where I was
* Unprofessional atmosphere. The managers frequently gossip about others loudly and indiscreetly in the office or in foreign languages they think we do not understand. This creates an unprofessional and uncomfortable working environment.
* Disregard for safety. Safety is not emphasized with the field personnel and individuals have been discouraged from submitting Near Miss incident reports by management.

What do you guys think? What can be worded differently or should be omitted? Should I be honest but possibly make enemies? Or should I just be quiet and let the group continue their downward spiral?

EDIT: I am also considering not writing any of this in the exit interview and keeping it cordial (our exit interview is an online form). But instead

****
Thanks for all the excellent input. I'm now considering being cordial in the exit ""interview"" (online form) and sitting down with the HR rep for 20 minutes. Many people here brought up the good point that 1) They haven't changed for 20+ years so why would they change now? And 2) They probably won't listen to me anyway. But they points I DO want to mention verbally to HR are:

1. Safety. Other departments and the company as a whole promote reporting incidents and close calls at all possible opportunities to make others aware of potential dangers. I can't believe I heard first hand a manager telling a tech to NOT fill out a report for a very minor incident. That is an absolute disregard for the well being of the staff and encouragement of safe habits.

2. The gossiping and public crap-talking by managers. It's a hostile environment suit waiting to happen.

But I think I might have fucked myself over, low-wage position and staying there as long as I did.   I was doing data entry for an HR department.  Did a few other HR things for the department, nothing major.  Got only a few feel-good, cosmetic ""promotions.""  Was hired at $28K, left at $32K.

It was at a big media company that I thought would look nice on my resume.  I was hoping they'd hire me to be an entry-level writer or editor.  They had one or two such openings each year.  But, anyway.  So here I am.

I've taken this new job through a family connection.  It's more data entry/filing

Am I setting myself up for doom by accepting a job for less money and no hope for new skills or advancement?  It's not actually working for the law firm but rather a contractor that handles their paperwork.  The hiring manager said I was overqualified and hinted at the fact that they're eventually looking for a supervisor of the department—but I don't want to be a fucking supervisor of the filing room.

I was making $32K at my previous job.  Now I'll be making $31K.  I was lucky to find an apartment-share for $650/month, to dream….

On a positive note, after numerous false starts, also makes me very happy.

I just don't know how I'm ever going to do to get out of this low-wage, never mind feeling fulfilled and like I'm doing something I enjoy.  What do I do?

1.) How long should I stay there for my own good
2.) How much time, in her words, ""begged"" them to offer me a job.)  She is not a lawyer or higher up.  She's just a secretary in their back office.  She assures me that ""they're watching and will look out"" for me.  But I'm skeptical.  This job is technically off-site.  It's in the basement.  I won't be interacting with the lawyers or anyone in the company.  And to be honest, I have no interest in being a lawyer or paralegal.  The hiring manager pretty much knows this and still hired me (he knows my step-mom and likes her a lot).
3.) What the fuck else is out there for me?  I'm lost and terrified.  I feel like I have no marketable skills.  The only things I'm good at besides writing, collating, VLOOKUP on Excel, eating shit, showing up on time, and using the numeric keypad to enter strings of numerals into a machine.

This completely floored me as this was a role that I’d been seriously considering over the past few months. When they showed me the job spec, it was pretty much my dream job: chance to teach, help young people, carry out research, etc. It seems too good to be true. And the salary is at the very top of my expectations.

Went for a 2nd interview a few days later and totally aced it. Got great feedback from the first interviewer how she really liked me and thought I would fit perfectly with their team. I was on cloud nine! I still have two more interviews with the company though

The recruiter just called though and said there’s some concerns about my lack of ‘real world’ work experience. Essentially

I’ve already begun formulating responses regarding my experience with students (I taught over 350 undergraduate seminars + I have tons of experience counselling and mentoring youngsters) and the fact that I have lots of office experience under my belt.

I’m 23 years old, paid vacation, etc. Sounds ideal, especially in times like these and for someone my age. I was unemployed for more than a year before I landed this job, so I am infinitely grateful for what I have now.

But I hate, and the root it is my job. My family and social lives are fine, but this job is destroying my soul.

Part of the problem is that I still live with my parents, and it seems senseless to start paying my own rent when my present accommodations are so near my workplace. (This isn’t just a rationalization, I promise – I really do want to move out. But I’m frugal to a fault, and it strikes me as a senseless expense.)

I’ve been sending out résumés for months and have already used up all my personal days (and one of my sick days) on interviews that led nowhere. I wouldn’t dream of outright quitting this job unless I have another reliable prospect, even though I plan to escape as soon as the opportunity arrives.

So, in an industry I don’t want to be in, in an office in the middle of the suburbs – and I hate being a domestic suburbanite at 23. And “data entry clerk” on my résumé isn’t going to open any doors in my preferred industry, so it seems like every day I spend here is just a day of wasted youth. I’m a bright, competent, ambitious guy, I have a bachelor’s degree with numerous honors (though the degree is in English – a poor choice, but I feel trapped.

She thanked me for my input, and for letting me know about my preference, and I thought the matter done, congratulating myself for having a boss open to feedback. She's been great while training me, complimenting me on how quickly I picked things up and generally being positive and upbeat.

Friday morning, because she was the owner of the company. She said that I did not deserve the title of Office Manager, as I was only doing half the duties of the position. (I am still in the 60-day probationary period for the position). She said that I didn't even have a car (which was NOT one of the requirements for the position. I was even upfront about that fact, and she said herself that it would not be a problem). She said that there was no room in the company with someone with an ego problem, and if I couldn't get an attitude adjustment over the weekend, then I could just not show up to work next week. She then sent me home early, like a disobedient kid

There were other red flags before this-- they advertised an $18 hourly rate for the position, because they said that they would increase it after thirty days depending on how quickly I picked up the software (I wrote this in my job acceptance email, and she agreed to this). I was supposed to have an informal job evaluation on Friday, but she sent me home and said that we would have a formal job evaluation next week instead, should I decide to come back.

I sell for a regional IT firm that has grown during my tenure from a smallish operation that was based in our metro area to a statewide operation with a focus on the western half of one of the larger states in the union.  I'm a slave to two masters

For most of my tenure, namely inefficient systems and a lack of direction.

Because of these problems

My story is this:  I had missed three consecutive months of goals last July, if that doesn't seem redundant to anyone) at the end of my first quarter with the company, Q4 2010.  Most of these clients had been neglected by the previous business (people don't sell super successful businesses for cut rates, after all) and required a lot of hand holding to get back into the fold.  Unfortunately, they also raised my recurring revenue to a point where the systems said that my personal goals should be raised.  The problem arose when the next quarter came and due to the intensive management that the new clients had required, my funnel wasn't full and my sales never came.  Hence a bum third quarter.

Flash forward to March of this year.  Our largest client (or my largest client) of the acquired clients (as well as my overall largest) has a major equipment failure on our watch and we have to again manage their transition to a different kind of system.  The recovery from the disaster and the engineering of the plan to move to a new system takes the better part of March to complete.  In early April I sell the project, but the product goal is far from where it needs to be, based also on the content of the project.

In May

I missed my product goal by about $1k.  This didn't seem like a big deal at the time since the service goals were more than there and that's keeping all of the delivery folks working.  My boss came in sulking, I knew that I hadn't lived up to all of my expectations and they were within the right to make the call.

Well, but involved conversation covering it and he made it very clear that he was happy with my progress and that, while there was a steep road ahead, he had no plans to let me go in the near future.

1299204856.0,fwzar,"""Microsoft"" interview experience: How to reject a bad offer.",kellyryanjones,38,4,23,"This is a story about my interview experience with Microsoft through a recruiting agency called Insight Global. I tell this as a warning to others in the same situation who may feel pressured into accepting an offer that is not right for them. 

It was in May of last year and I'd just graduated from college with a bachelors degree in Computer Engineering. I had already been looking for jobs for about a month before the recruiter from Insight Global contacted me. I hadn't had a lot of luck with interviews and was beginning to become nervous about the situation. I was getting interviews

She vaguely described the position mostly just stating its title and asked for my information. I responded in kind and didn't hear back from her for a couple of weeks. I had many other interviews and resumes out at the time and it was easy to lose track. 
The position was for the build team which meant fixing build breaks all day long which I wasn't overly excited about so it fell to the back of my mind. 

Two weeks later, which is what I assume the two week delay was about. 
I proceed with the interview, and that was that. I was a little disturbed since I had heard Microsoft interviews were supposed to be difficult and yet this was the easiest interview I had had since graduating. Red flag #1.  
After the interview she called me on the phone asking how I thought the interview went. She then asked if she could accept the offer on my behalf ... I said no. Red flag #2. 
A day or so later she calls saying that Microsoft would like to hire me and if I would accept their offer. So far, but little else. I had lots of questions about benefits and wanted to get them answered before I signed any contracts. She gave me a phone number to call was forwarded to her manager and thats when I found out the truth...

I was to be a contractor employed by Insight Global to do work for Microsoft. The pay was $17 an hour, with the contract to be ""reviewed"" in 6 months. I wanted some time to think about my options and asked to see written documents. They refused to provide them, I asked for the weekend to think about it, and they refused to give it to me. They wanted me to accept the offer over the phone right then and there. They were trying to bully me into accepting this position and I knew it. I declined their offer. 
The next day I received this email from the recruiter:

&gt;I just got a chance to talk with my account manager and understand you have declined the opportunity with Microsoft under Bob’s team. I have to say I am disappointed with the nature of the situation. A lot of time and consideration was taken out on our and Bob’s end to get you an interview. To even get an interview with Microsoft right out of college is a very grand opportunity. When it comes to rate, especially when they have already been discussed. This is not only unprofessional but is good to know for your knowledge when interviewing in the future. I do hope you take this experience and find a position that is suitable for you. Have a good weekend and the best of luck!

Obviously she was upset. I come to find out that there was a limited amount of time that Insight Global had to fill a particular position for Microsoft and because of their error with the first candidate they were now completely out of time. Which is why they refused to let me think about the offer. They made a mistake

Two months later I had two competing offers for twice the pay

So in bullet points here are my tips:

* Know your worth: Read average salaries for your area if you're offered much less there is a reason and it might not be you

* Nail the interview: Interviewing is key to getting offers. If you're coming out of college like me

* Beware of Recruiters: They *can* help you find jobs

* Practice interviewing : Accept interviews for jobs and places that you may not actually want. Don't interview at your dream job first

Within the first few weeks of being my manager he scheduled a meeting with me during my FMLA to discuss my yearly review. He said I was in the bottom 10% of his employees and that I sucked all around at my job (the gist anyway). The meeting took about 1.5 hours. That was in December. At the time I asked for a road map so I could prove myself to my new manager and he said that I should just work harder and be a self starter. Pretty much he said that it was up to me to improve my performance and that I should need less guidance. 

In the next 2 months he has given me conflicting direction on what I should be focused on with one day telling me to stop working on something then the next day asking why that same thing had not been completed. It got pretty irrational at times. 

Fast forward to last Friday. He tells me that he was going to give me a road map but that I suck so much at my job that he doesn't see the point and that I should take the rest of the day off to contemplate quitting. He wrote his list of grievances down in an email. I sent back a reply with my version of events. At that point I figured I was either getting fired with cause or laid off. 

Monday morning HR calls me. She tells me that she found out about the Friday meeting and understands that it was pretty rough for me. That she is going to require that my boss provide me with a month long road map to get me up to speed. 

The first task on the road map is to create a complex task that he usually gives new hires to improve their skills, when I approach my co-worker - I am told that my boss specifically told my peers to not help me or work with me in anyway and to tell him if I ask. I approached HR and my boss about it and he started back tracking. Since then he has enacted other subversive efforts to keep me from completing my road map.

At this point I am ready and willing to leave the company. However

1- Prior to my search, and dress. From there, I chose the ones that I felt would best represent me and my beliefs, personality, and ideas to add to my repertoire. 

2- I took one of the most successful candidates from that pool and used their resume as a template for my own. The one I chose had a brief introductory paragraph and 5 bullet points highlighting my relevant skills in place of the second paragraph. The third paragraph discussed my previous work and school experience and why I though my skills fit their position. PROOF READ every letter before you hit send.

3- I prepped for each phone interview by researching their website and choosing questions specific to their department. I also added a few questions that were based on things they mentioned during the interview. This helped to illustrate my listening skills as well as my continued interest in the position.

4-During the phone interview, and confirm comprehension. 

5-At the end of each interview

6-Preparing for the in-person interview was similar to the phone interview. I did more research on the department and the key people I would be meeting with. I read up on anything they'd published or initiatives they were known for. 

7- I chose a suit that was ""classic"" (just a plain black suit) and a shirt under it that showed some personality. Your color choice should reflect your personality

8-During the in-person interview, one director discussed assessment as a key initiative they would be working on, so at the end, I asked a question about what they were currently doing with assessment and how I might be able to assist in moving the department forward.

9- Smile. Be confident.There is nothing sexier than confidence. Often hiring is based on the arbitrary idea of [whether someone wants to be your friend](http://career-advice.monster.ca/job-interview/following-up/real-reasons-you-didnt-get-job/article.aspx?WT.mc_n=Ycanada_YToday)

10-At the end of your interview

11-Thank you notes. I know, but think about it this way: if you send a thank you (at least to the boss and hiring manager or person who scheduled your interview) they are reminded of you as they consider candidates. The more they think of you, the better.

1336562730.0,tejjq,UPDATE: Redditors I need your help. I'm at risk of losing my dream job.,matthewmathme,40,4,5,"Original post is [here] (http://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/sq2ca/redditors_i_need_your_help_im_at_risk_of_losing/). So I went for my (third) interview with three senior managers last Wednesday morning. The interview was tough especially when it became clear that I lacked the career advisor experience they were looking for. I tried to convince them that much of the technical knowledge they were asking (i.e. how they application procedures differ between a multi-national bank and a hedge fund) were things I could learn on the job but to no avail. Needless to say

Luckily, combined with my diverse range of experience in sector, convinced them to hire me for an admin post, with some career advisor elements thrown in. I still had to go for a fourth interview yesterday which was mainly a formality and a chance for them to give me a few admin proficiency tests, which I easily passed.

So after seven months, working with a great team, with plenty of opportunities for promotion and a salary dead on my expectations. Here are some of the things I learned along the way…

1)	Keep in regular touch with your recruiters. I had seven of them working to find me a post. Only two of them were really any good but they were very friendly and really worked hard. It also helped that I popped in occasionally to say ‘Hi’ and just remind them of who I was and that I was still searching. I think recruiters are more inclined to work hard for you if they like you (and you have desirable/marketable skills).

2)	Know yourself. This is by far the most important one in my mind. If you have a comprehensive understanding of what you’re good at, avoid applying for positions you really aren’t well suited for. The Myers-Briggs Personality Test was really helpful for me in this regards. I learned that I’m an ENFP which really aided me in figuring out what my ideal career might be.

3)	Similar to the above – take advantage of books such as What Color is your Parachute and other job hunting guides. Parachute had a whole bunch of exercises aimed at teaching you about yourself which really helped me figure out what I wanted to do. It’s also a good way working on your job hunt when you tire of sending out applications and filling in forms at the end of a day.

4)	Don’t let a new job opportunity excite you too much. This way, stopped sending out as many applications as I could have because I was sure I’d get an interview/offer, and then was completely crushed when it didn’t happen. 

Thanks to all of you for your support and encouragement. It’s a relief to have the process over and done with. **For those of you still hunting

My third choice employer blatantly asked how much money my first choice is offering, but I can't be picky right now). I'm a noob and didn't consider this situation before it happened, so I told 3rd choice that I can't make that decision until I really know the two companies, but that I would likely prefer the my first choice if pay was similar. I also told 3rd choice the salary that I asked from 1st choice. BAD BAD BAD!

They set up an interview anyway, if you get this job, you will likely leave soon because you prefer the other company."" Uh, I haven't been offered either position, so why are you jumping to that conclusion, I said. I ended up practically hanging up on them.

Luckily my first and second choice employers are still in the running.

Here’s what I learned about looking for a job...",poopskid99,36,11, but I think interviews serve very little purpose. Being good at interviews and being good at your job are (for most people) two very different skill sets. So the person who could do the best job for the company may be rejected because he or she happens to speak too quietly or has a limp handshake. I mean sure, competence

Luckily you can use this to gain an advantage over more qualified candidates. Seriously

**2. Don’t take rejection personally.** So you’ve been waiting in anticipation for weeks after your interview. You thought it went well, do yourself a favor and don’t take it personally. More important, don’t let it discourage you.

The truth is that you have absolutely no idea why you were passed over (unless by some miracle they provide you with feedback). Sometimes HR just needs to fill an interview quota. Sometimes a hiring manager had already intended to hire a friend but just conducted some sham interviews in an effort to look unbiased. Sometimes there is not even a position available, I think perseverance is what’s needed for a successful job search.

**3. Recruiters/temp agencies are a mixed bag

So read the advice on r/jobs about recruiters and approach them with some skepticism. But if you find a really nice recruiter then latch on!

**4. Try to learn as much as you can about the company culture before the interview.** This sounds obvious, upper management was either absent or too busy to deal with problems that arose in my department, so I learned to use my own judgement to squash problems in their tracks. I thought it was a great little speech, but the interview informed me that this is *never* to be done at this company -- any problems not specifically outlined in procedural documents were to be turned over to senior management, no decisions were to be made without them. Oops. I wasn’t offered the job.

I'm a college student

I applied to a Bed, explaining my situation and being completely honest. I tell them I'm in class during the day, so I won't be available. On my job application, I listed that I was available Tuesday through Sunday from 4pm-11pm. I have rehearsals on Monday from 6pm-11pm and Saturday from 2pm-6pm (I'm a theater major). Pick any 15-20 hours from 4pm-11pm. He gladly obliged, said it's admirable to pursue an education. I was hired on the spot, filled out all the paperwork, and told my schedule will be emailed in about 72 hours. Fantastic.

Just got the schedule. Here's what it says.

1. Saturday (July 6th) - 10:30am - 7pm
2. Monday - 8am - 5pm
3. Tuesday - 8am - 5pm
4. Wednesday - 8am-5pm
5. Thursday - 6pm - close
6. Friday - 8am-5pm
7. Saturday - 10:30am - 7pm

Why did this happen? How could they tell me these things about admirable pursuit of an education, I cannot possibly work this schedule.

What is going on here?

**EDIT** - Hey everyone, I was asking if they can do this and just disregard everything? Should I assume I have to look elsewhere since they seem to be unable to compromise and have no problem lying directly to my face like I'm crazy? I should have expanded further before, but there is no training program. I was told that on a Saturday or Sunday, I had to come in and watch a few videos, go through a few computer modules, and the rest of the training is live fire on the floor (I'm a sales rep). It's only disappointing since I've been unemployed since April because the last job kept trying to squeeze in more hours than I could handle in college, so they let me go as well. I made it so clear in the application AND interview.

I called today, make a new schedule, and I could come get a paper copy. I said okay. I go to get a paper copy, here it is: http://i.imgur.com/H0Sl6Ls.jpg

""You want an admin job?  Aren't those easy to get?""  Well maybe if everyone didn't have that thought and everyone I know is scrambling to get those jobs to get a leeway into any industry...

""WHY would you leave your job?""  ""Geez you young people have no patience/loyalty to the company""  Well I guess the thought that some (by some I mean many!) employers take advantage of the fact that its tough out there and ""beggars can't be choosers"" and treat us like dirt did not cross their mind? I don't mind being treated like that to a degree but we all know...how horrific it can get.

I applied for a position in the marketing department of a large-ish company around Thanksgiving. The husband of an acquaintance of my mom's is high up in the company

Not long after (early December) I got an email from a woman with the title ""Recruitment Specialist"" saying my high-up contact had forwarded her my resume and she'd like to have a phone interview. The interview went ok but not great in my opinion

In March I got an email from a different person with the title ""Corporate Recruiting Manager"" saying she'd recently gotten my resume from the high-up contact and wanted a phone interview. It seemed a little weird to have a second HR/recruiting interview, maybe they hired someone who didn't work out and they went back to old applications, whatever. She asked very similar questions to the first interview and overall it went very well in my opinion, but she didn't say anything indicating that she knew I'd been interviewed before. She said I'd hear back in about two weeks. I never heard anything.

Now I have a third email requesting a phone interview with a different person. Her title is ""Recruitment Associate"". This email also mentions that she was recently forwarded my resume by the high-up guy

In theory I really want this job

**TL;DR I applied for a job 6 months ago and interviewed but didn't hear back. I interviewed again a few months later with someone who didn't seem to know I'd interviewed already

My girlfriend (lets call her Sarah) is very complaisant and accommodating, in the past year, almost everyone in her department has antagonized her because she doesn't join in on the self perpetuating drama they create and maintain in the office.

Her manager is a 40+ year old woman who loves drama and uses her corporate hierarchy status against anyone who she would deem useless to her. Then there's the former friends who have used their old relationship with Sarah against her
Things from spreading rumors, and has kept in touch with them as close friends for years. And now they've all abandoned her. I mean these people are so vengeful that they bring their personal feelings and grudges to work, even when Sarah has disconnected from them in her life. She can't even go to HR to complain about it because she'll be blacklisted by her manager.

Now my girlfriend is doing what she's been doing for the past year, which shouldn't be so difficult for her since she has the credentials and experience, along with many great references to back her up. But the issue is still with her manager. This woman is very dedicated to shaming anyone who leaves her department in bad taste. And she can smell the scent of fear.

I've already told her to build up a tougher shell against this type of stuff, but I can tell that she's having bits and pieces of her soul sucked out every time she goes to work. Her friends and family tell her to suck it up but I think her finding another job would be better. The only things that stop her from quitting is that 1) She absolutely loves what she does and the company she works for and 2) Her evil bitch of a manager would probably take it as an offense and plan to shame her to any company that she might want to move to (she has a lot of connections).

What can she do? Or what should she do?

**TL;DR Girlfriend is being driven insane by her managers and coworkers (friends she helped get hired) and now they're almost ganging up on her and trying to get her fired.**

I'm not even that picky.  My criteria are simply that it be at least a step above retail (I'm fine with office work or customer service),000 (which is actually a little more than I'm living on now).

* 5% Just for getting me a job
* 5% If it's in the film industry
* 5% If it's within 3 miles of me, etc. (La Cienega &amp; the 10)

This can easily turn into a couple grand going to charity.

**About me:** I'm a smart

Right now I make money as a freelance script reader/editor.  I love this, I didn't go to school for it, so it's hard to get my foot in the door.

I also have a history in over-the-phone customer service and office work.  While I'm most passionate about film, so a straightforward steady employment sounds really welcome right now.  I'm a quick learner and can adapt to about any job you guys can find for me.

I don't think Reddit is my personal army, but I'm getting close to the breaking point.  I've got a bank account with less than $10, and due to some medical issues, my parents aren't a safety net.  I don't want to give up and leave this city, or the people that I love who live here.  Since I had this idea, I've held off on asking for your help for months, until it's finally hit the point that my ""worry"" side of the scale outweighs the ""look like an entitled ass"" side.

Writing samples for my script coverage, etc. are available on request.  Please ask me if you have any questions.  And since Los Angeles is all about headshots, [here I am] (http://i.imgur.com/mdtxJ.jpg), so you know you won't be hiring a terrifying internet stranger.  Beard is optional.
