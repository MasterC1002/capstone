I didn't want us to go to the park too early as we would be spending ALL day there

But in the back of my mind I knew I wanted to do the Racers.  Man they sounded amazing when you walked by them.  So we tried again later that afternoon.  100 minutes!  Whoohoo!!  That's only an hour and 40 minutes.  We can do that!  We're from Canada so who knows when we'll have another chance.  The ride sounds amazing.

So me and my little ones are headed for the line when out jump these three 'angels' who offer us the last three spots on their 6 person fastpass.  We're ecstatic....over the moon!  We say yes

I couldn't have thanked them enough after the ride and just wanted to throw this onto reddit and offer it to the universe.  Karma is an amazing thing and I talked to my kids about paying it forward after that.

EDIT: Thanks guys

Other secrets: Walt Disney had the windows on Main street painted with names

At the firestation on Main S. The light in the top right corner window is ALWAYS on. Why? Because that was Walts' private room

The pathway between Thunder Mountain, the employees didnt know what to do with the animatrons, so what were they to do? Bury them they said, and every time you walk on that stretch of land, you are walking feet above buried animatrons.

In the Haunted Mansion, or somthing sharp and heavy, and threw it as the glass pane in the Haunted Mansion. Because of the way the Mansion was built, they couldn't fix the glass without taking off the roof of the mansion, taking out the pane, and putting it back in. So they made lemonade, They popped a spider right there

The obvious one in the Haunted Mansion, is Walt Disney.

We had a party of 8 people. It's been one guy's life long dream to go


Once we were let in, but the lift feels a pretty nice mechanical smooth. Once we were upstairs, one waitress told us we could take as many pictures as we wanted to. I kind of wish I took more looking back on it.


I decided to go with the 5 course set menu. I felt it would be a more complete experience. After we ordered we got to go out on the balconies and look at the view. It's pretty surreal being up there and just watching all the people walk by


All in all we spent 4 hours inside the club. We savored every bit of it since we will most likely never ever get to go again. It was a very great experience that I am lucky to have had.

Living in the Bay Area I visit every few months with my girlfriend and a few friends. We drive down to Anaheim late at night and get there in the early morning. Nap a few hours after check in and hit the park bright and early for a week straight. Blended mochas, popcorn, funnel cakes fueling this madness/happiness. Picking up pins, mickey ears, vinylmations, memories and stories. Dining at Cafe Orleans, Trader Sam's, Fireworks and Fantasmic. All of these great feelings and memories for a week straight are dashed by that feeling you get while leaving the park and going back to reality, each one a reminder of the life you are heading back to. Somewhat wishing for Prozac or some pick me up to make the feeling disappear. Jokingly talk of quitting our jobs and moving to so-cal then realizing how it wouldn't work because of work

I knew Radiator Springs Racers was going to be cool. You can tell it's a great ride just by seeing it from afar--that beast was crafted with love. However... it really did exceed my expectations. I didn't know about (doing my best to avoid spoilers) the inside part. It was all very well done. The line lasted 35 minutes from just inside the entry arch to the front
  
I've been hearing a lot of gripes from guests about Luigi's Flying Tires--that it's hard to get moving, which wasn't as long as I feared it would be.  
  
Mater's Junkyard Jamboree was more fun than I anticipated, so I don't know how fast the line moves.  
  
The food at Flo's V8 Cafe looked pretty good for the price, moved very slowly. The pretzel and apple freeze line was very short, mostly because they don't serve soda (which comes in a cone cup, so everyone wanted a soda). I got an apple freeze, which was *weird*. I got it because a bunch of guests said it was good, but I expected it to taste like the fruit, not apple *pie*. It was very cinnamony, just too much sugar for me.  
  
Buena Vista Street is quite lovely. The stores are spacious, and Practical's (AKA Starbucks) and thought it was really good! The bun was soft and warm, and the cheese was gooey. I was quite happy with my choice.

Husband and I took our two kids to Disneyland last week to meet up with some relatives we hadnt seen in quite a while. It was my first time and my daughters fifth birthday. 

To be honest I was not expecting to like it. Growing up I never was a Disney person. So I was shocked when we needed to add a day to our three day passes

Her in her princess dress decked out with a tiara from a flower girl stint, as soon as he realized he would get hugs and cuddles. He even bust a move for Jasmine in the middle of the restaurant and she joined in after being suitably impressed by his coutrship dance. 

It was magical. Even with the crowds. Even with the money spent. Even with in laws. 

Then I lost my phone. Foolishly I had been recording those moments on a phone and assumed dropbox was doing its thing. Not realizing I had maxed out my capasity months ago. I went and left it on a UA flight from LAX to Denver. 

So now I am just heart broken. Not only because of our vacation photos

When I realized what I had done in the Denver airport and that no one could find it for me

I just purchased my tickets and it worked perfectly. I purchased through Orbitz, but through this site called, [Ebates.com](http://www.ebates.com/), they give you cash back on your purchase through [Orbitz.com](http://www.orbitz.com/things-to-do/) and right now the rate is 5.25% back on total purchase of an activity event( Disneyland Tickets). After the cash back you get another $15 off each ticket bringing the total to $260 a piece which would normally buy you a 3-day hopper. I was lucky enough to get 10.5% back on my purchase but the rate fluctuates. There is also travelocity and other popular sites they offer money back on. You could find the hotel you want to find in the list of sites supported and maybe get money back on them as well. You simply print out your voucher and take it to a kiosk and they give you your tickets. It's fast simple and it worked through Orbitz. It was the best type of deal I could find.

Last week my wife &amp; I took our 4 year-old to Disneyland (Anaheim) for his first time.  He's a bit of a Star Wars nut, and it was my first time on that too so we had a blast.  My son has already seen the movies (Episodes IV-VI) a dozen times and is a true Jedi at heart (unless he misses a nap, then it's off to the Dark Side).

Then he *insisted* on doing the Jedi Training at the Tomorrowland stage.  If you haven't seen this before, and teach them a few moves.  THEN the stage opens up, Dath Vader &amp; Maul come out and the kids do their lightsaber moves on them, one at a time.  At the end of the training the kids get a little diploma.

So my son and I are waiting for the Jedi selection process.  He's clearly the smallest...most of the kids look like they're over 5.  But they're playing Star Wars soundtrack music in the background while they set up for the training and my son is standing up ""conducting"" the soundtrack music.  This gets the attention of one of the cast members...a guy named Jason.  He goes up and talks with my son for a good two to three minutes

Eventually the selection process starts and Jason stays nearby, he's the youngest &amp; smallest so he needed a little help.

But then two Stormtroopers rush in, my son starts to freak out and yep...tears start to fall.  My wife and I were ready to pull him out, but Jason jumps in, takes my son to the side and cools him out, staying with him and being his personal cheerleader, giving him the confidence to go up against Lord Vader himself.  Then he escorts my son back to us ensuring that, in the end

Without this guy Jason, but to us he really went above &amp; beyond.  He needs to be credited.  

I see there's a link on the Disneyland site to contact them:
[https://disneyland.disney.go.com/help/email/](https://disneyland.disney.go.com/help/email/) but I wonder if anyone knows of a more appropriate method of communication that gives Jason the best chance of getting the credit he deserves.

(And yes, we promised him that Disneyland was ""his day"".)

**tl;dr - What's the most effective way of praising a cast member so he/she gets recognized?**

Thanks for your time.

“Hi…” I answered, I started to cry, with the biggest grin on my face. After calming myself, we continued with our day. About an hour and a half later, we were trying to kill time before our Blue Bayou dinner reservations. The next activity was mine to choose, and I decided I wanted to go back to Merida, to thank her and get a picture to remember the day by. We trekked back to the area, I thanked her for stepping away from the group before. She seemed so excited to see me, being who I am, and we pinky swore on it (which my wonderful boyfriend got a picture of). We took a few more pictures

I have two things I'd change.

1. Autopia. I think I would get rid of it, and the payoff is a somewhat uninspired ride that kids of all ages love, but adults don't really care for (well, because adults can drive *for real*). I know it's been around forever, but Disneyland is feeling a little cramped for space (there is room for renovation, but not a lot for addition) and I think this space could be used for a number of new and exciting things!

2. It's a Small World. I love this ride. It's possibly *the* quintessential Disneyland attraction (up there with Peter Pan). It has a beautiful history and a great message. However, especially comparing to the quality things they can do in new rides like Ariel's Undersea Adventure. I say keep the dolls as they are, but replace *almost all* of the scenery with higher quality plastic/fiberglass/plaster/whatever scenery. A lot of small world is painted plywood that you can see the hammered together stands.

What could possibly go wrong?

Well

* May 24th is a Friday
* Most annual passes can attend (only the cheap one is blocked
* May 24th is the start of a holiday weekend - Memorial day weekend
* Memorial day weekend is a three day weekend/holiday for a lot of people
* May 24th is a GRAD NITE
* Because of Grad Nite


So, and you have a whole new disaster waiting to happen.


**Grad Nite

Selected excerpts about the Grad Nite on May 24th from the posts on the Disneyland Grad Night facebook page.  As far as I can tell

""Grad Nite tickets are Park Hopper ticket[s] which allows Grad Nite seniors to enjoy both parks all day long. The Grad Nite Private Party is in Disney California Adventure. while some “Monstrous Summer” activities will take place in parts of Disney California Adventure during Grad Nite, which is all of Disney California Adventure, except for Buena Vista Street, The Mad T Party area and the Soarin' Attraction.*""

Bold and *italics* as well as [edits] by me.  Except was edited from several posts into one paragraph but no content was changed.


So

1345746877.0,ypixv,I just got back from Disneyland and these are some thoughts I had on all the new things and remodels.,tryingtoberelevant,18,6,46,"I'll start with DCA:

**Cars Land**: Awesome new land. My favorite part is how it so closely mimics the movie. My son absolutely loved it and wanted to spend a lot of time there. We could only spend so much time

**Mater's Junkyard Jamboree**: I thought this was a great ride. It's big enough that the line is never really long and everyone I watched seemed to really be enjoying it. 

**Luigi's Flying Tires**: Most of what I read about this ride is true. It seems like a really cool concept but it's a little boring and hard to maneuver. My son and other kids were clearly enjoying it and I thought it was just OK. The line for this ride is always long and not worth it imo. They also took away the beach balls so you can't even throw them at people anymore. Where's the fun in that?

**Radiator Springs Racers**: Great ride but it is always breaking down (as most people say). I got in line right at 7:00am and waited for an hour a half because it took 45 minutes to get the thing working right. Once I finally got on, and fun. It goes really fast which makes me wish I had the patience to wait in line one more time to ride it again and take in everything. Once this rides popularity dies down, I will ride it again. 

**Flo's V8 Cafe**: This place is great. There are plenty of seating areas so you're sure to find a table quickly. The food is...well...like every other Disney restaurant - sub-par. I had the American Breakfast which was pretty gross but I was able to swallow it. I saw a few people going for the banana caramel french toast which looked good because it was smothered in sugar. They do have cute little Lightning McQueen souvenir boxes for the kids

**Carthay Circle Restaurant**:  I dined here because I'm a foodie and I don't mind spending money on good food. I was disappointed. But first let me say that the interior is amazing. It's a beautiful restaurant filled with the Disney detail I love so much. Now on to the food: I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Halibut over diced mangoes and the fish was dry and overcooked. The flavor was decent but definitely not my favorite dish. I also ordered a mojito and it wasn't very good. In addition to the fish, either. After about 20 or 30 minutes they brought out a bowl of their cheddar, bacon, jalapeno biscuits with apricot butter as a ""sorry, we're slacking."" I didn't say anything about us having to wait for our food, I didn't mind much. It was a nice gesture. The biscuits were decent but they needed more bacon and jalapeno to make them superb. 

**Buena Vista Street**: I really love Buena Vista street. The new entrance works so well with the rest of the park. Walt and Mickey's statue is a great addition. Starbucks and Clarabelle's are right next to each other which is very convenient. Clarabelle's offers a hand dipped ice cream bar which is delicious. The coffee is good but, too, and staff is incredibly friendly. It wasn't too crowded in the stores so I enjoyed that. 

Overall

**Disneyland**

**Matterhorn**: I didn't see much difference with the snow on the mountain but I know they did a lot of work on it. Each car now seat three, most riders rode individually so they didn't have to have anybody in their lap. Now it's a guaranteed 3 rather than a likely 2 if that makes sense. Anyway, the first time I rode I sat in the back. It bumped a lot and was not comfortable. The second time I sat in the middle and while it was a little more cramped, I wasn't jerked around as much. Overall, the ride is fine but I don't think it's the best remodel. Oh well, I still enjoy it. 

I can't really think of much else right now. I didn't make it to the Carnation Cafe but it looked great from the outside. The Ghiradelli Soda Fountain and Chocolate Shop in DCA was tasty

Some of the CM's I ran into have been grumpy. It was hot when we went

Our plan is to get married at the crack of dawn at our airport with a few friends. When I say crack of dawn I mean like 3:30-4:00 AM. We'd be all dressed up, then hop the first plane to Disneyland. We'd drop our bags at the hotel and head into the park still dressed up and spend our wedding day taking ridiculous photos.

The thing I'm worried about is getting denied entry at the front gate. I know you can't wear wedding dresses in the park because of safety and concern for being considered an employee. My dress is going to be short and not white, and he'll probably be without the jacket for most of the day. We're fully prepared to be uncomfortable for a day and I'm guessing I'll probably ruin my dress, but I'm pretty okay with that. 

We're not trying to sneak a ceremony into the park. We'll already be married when we get there. We're not bringing in a fancy camera. Yes

- What are the ""absolutely must see"" items?

- What are the tricks to get neat/special stuff?  I've seen a couple comments about getting to pilot/getting honory badges
