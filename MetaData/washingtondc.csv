I'm a black woman living in Columbia Heights.

One of the things I love about living in DC is the diversity. We're lucky to be living in a city with such a diverse cultural makeup. I lived in San Francisco for the summer and I yearend for the ethnic and cultural tapestry that is DC. 

I get that not everyone living in DC has embraces DC's diversity like I do and that's fine. Diversity isn't everyone's thing. However

As much as I love this subreddit (and I really really love this subreddit) the casual racism here genuinely makes me sad. It makes it difficult to freely peruse this subreddit the way I wish I could. There are posts on here that I KNOW will have a lot of racism in the comments. I always tell myself not to look at the comments

 Maybe some people think of r/washingtondc as a kind of all-white ""safe space.""  Maybe they think it's a place where you can air your casual racism and have it be okay. I just want you guys to know that just like in DC

I see a lot of casual racism here and it always hurts. I absolutely love talking race and our racial differences

 I guess [this](http://i.imgur.com/TTidb.jpg) post today broke the camel's back

Let's learn about/from each other and have open conversations about our racial differences, hangups, and misconceptions. But let's try to keep it civil.

1366830047.0,1d10ej,Flash Mob Needed to make a little girls dream come true!,Kel79,291,60,74,"***UPDATES AT BOTTOM***

I am in need of a flash mob. I am a chairperson for Stillbrave which is a childhood cancer foundation for the DC/MD/VA area. We have a little girl who was just recently diagnosed with brain cancer that we are helping. We provide non-medical assistance to families that are dealing with this crappy thing called cancer. Well...this little girl hasn't been doing so well. She's lost her appetite (which is fairly normal with chemotherapy) and is having a hard time right now. Tara's dream has always been to be a princess. So we are making that dream come true. We have reserved a horse drawn carriage for Friday May 3rd. Tara's mom is having a princess tea party for her and her friends. Our director, put a glass slipper on her little foot and then take her and her friends for a carriage ride.

Now here is where you can come in and help. We want to make her feel like the most special princess there is. So we want to get a large flash mob of people lining the main street the carriage is going to take holding up ""Princess Tara"" signs and cheering her on.

I mean...who wouldn't want to be a part of making this little girl smile? We want this to be big! We want people cheering and yelling and just going nuts for this little girl. She needs a pick me up so she can fight this horrible disease and go on to have many more of her dreams come true. So who's with me? All it will take is a little bit of your time and enthusiasm.

We'd like to keep this hush hush so it's a real surprise for Tara.

Here are the details:  

When:  Friday

Time:  Lining up around 6pm…we’ll be picking Tara up around 6:30pm
Where:  Start lining up at Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow Rd. (they won’t be able to see us from their house)

Who:  ANYONE!  Everyone!  Bring your kids

If anyone would like more details or to help please feel free to contact me at: donations@stillbrave.org

Also check out our site to get more details about what we are doing: www.stillbrave.org

Thank you all....I've read so many stories about Reddit users coming out to help people like this and I hope I'm proved right about how awesome you guys are :)

Kel

edit:  Street name has been corrected from Brand to Brandy.  Sorry!  


***UPDATE 5-1-13***
Okay I've talked with Tom (Stillbrave's director) and have a little more info.  Tara's mom will be bringing her home at 5:30pm.  So to avoid the possibility of them seeing a large crowd out there we are asking that everyone meet up at the Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow intersection closest to Rt. 50.  We want to keep people off of Stringfellow any closer to their until we hear that they've made it home.  At that point us Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will get you all in position.  So we can go from from that intersection back towards Rt. 50 and we should be fine.  We can also have people line up on Brandy Station on the far side.  Don't worry...we will be in Stillbrave TShirts so you all will recognize us.  If you're not sure where to go just find one of us and we'll direct you to the right area.

We do not know what route the carriage will take yet...it'll depend on the crowd.  

***********************************

**UPDATE 4-26-13:  Parking...I've spoken with a resident who lives in that area and there is ample street parking for normal use.  This event might go beyond the normal use spectrum.  So here are the options:  There is a pool on Stringfellow for the community that has a parking lot.  I'd use that if you have really small kids

Both corners of Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow will be the staging areas.  Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will be on hand to get you in position.

Lastly (for today at least) are there any videographers out there willing to donate their time to come out and record this for Tara?  We'd like to be able to give her a DVD of it that she can watch anytime she's feeling down &amp; needs a pick me up.  Please contact me at:  donations@stillbrave.org if you are interested in donating your time for this.

I'm sure most of you have seen the articles about corruption and ineffectiveness at the DC Taxicab commission. DC cabs regularly violate the rules and get away with it...and most of you have probably seen it in person. For example

* Ask you where you are going before they let you in
* Refuse to take you anywhere within the District
* For a dispatcher to even ask you where you are going before they send a cab
* Refuse to turn off the radio

I want to do something about this

So, overcharge you, whatever, write down the taxicab company's name and any other info you can get (ideally, the taxi number, driver's name and license plate.) Even better, record the whole thing on your cell phone. (DON'T RECORD IT SECRETLY IF YOU'RE IN MARYLAND.) Then PM me or email me (inquiries at taloslaw.com) and we'll see if we can go after them.

No one is going to get rich doing it, I'll eat them. And if we win, I'll get them from the court). And you could get $1500 for your time, which is pretty sweet. And most importantly, if we do a few of these and word gets around that the law is actually getting enforced, it'll start sucking a lot less to take a cab in this city.

Thanks! And again,False,,t5_2qi2g,False,,,t3_tq3vf

It's Spring

If you see a swarm of bees, but we can.

If you watch the news, monocultural agriculture (with attendant pesticides), a resurgent pest population, and a difficult summer last year. Many of us have lost our bees, too, even though we are trying to build naturally resistent colonies and treat our bees as treasures, not commodities.

Please remember: honeybees are under extreme threat, and climate change, but THRIVE. We beekeepers can grab those bees, give them safe homes somewhere else, and help ensure a healthier future where honeybees can continue to make our food supply and green spaces grow. It is a kind of compliment to DC that we have a place where honeybees and people can collaborate so well. ""

**UPDATE 2: POST PARTY UPDATE**

Thanks again to everyone who came out last night. The only thing that broke was my toilet seat. Let the jokes begin. I have all the photos on my computer, give me a ring.

Also

Lastly

* What? The 4th Annual Bike House Fundraiser Party
* Where? BHPD, Washington DC
* When? September 15
* Why? Because your $10 helps us help fix bikes!

**UPADTE 1: PARTY WRAP UP:**

Thanks everyone who came out tonight. We probably had ~100 people show up and not a single problem. DC Reddit is good peeps. The party started at 8:23 and the last people just left at 2:52. Not too shabby. Tomorrow I will post pictures and videos for everyone to check out. There were so many wonderfully people who came out tonight

P.S. If anyone is wondering

**ORIGINAL POST**

My roommate is gone for two weeks and it's time to break in my new apartment. I made a [post earlier today](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/zvqhh/new_to_the_area_and_my_roommate_is_gone_for_two/) and several folks wanted to do a house party tonight.

If you show up, all within two blocks of my place. I have everything to make Pina Coladas except Rum. Can someone bring that?

The party starts at 8 and goes to whenever (the later the better). I have space for crashing if it's needed. But tomorrow I am leaving at noon-ish for the h-street festival.

* Who can bring **~~Cards against humanity?~~**
* Who can bring **~~Beer Pong Balls?~~**

If you can't make it

* Host: Bryan
* Number: 520 302 4829

* Address: [2301 champlain st nw](https://maps.google.com/maps?q=2301+Champlain+St+NW
* For the red line
* For the green/yellow line
* If you just want the closest

*If you're absolutely coming

Thank you for helping me tonight on 18th st. in Adams Morgan. My good friend was being accosted by two ""Marines."" She was too intoxicated to take care of herself, asking why I was ""following them."" He tried to explain that ""she totally wanted it,"" even though she was clearly trying to get away from the two guys groping her. I grabbed the two nearest guys, both of whom were pretty large African American dudes, and asked them for help. They helped me confront the ""Marines"" (I use that term very loosely), and together we scared them away. After finding a police officer, the officer helped get my friend into a cab, but please know that I really am thankful for the help that you two random strangers gave me and my friend tonight.

Edit: Hey everyone. Sorry for the dramatic nature of that post

I was going to delete the post, maybe finding an officer should have been the first thing I did. God knows there are enough of them in Adams Morgan at night.

Today,k0sh,http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/j09dz/10_years_ago_today_i_hit_a_tree_on_a_dirtbike_at/

To give you the long and short of it, I shattered an inch of my right femur, broke five ribs, chipped my collar bone, cracked my shoulder blade, collapsed a lung and broke my hip in two places. 

After my Mother, but in the process of taking it off, they accidentally snapped my knee cap in half forcing me to go back in for another surgery to repair that. After over a year of Physical Therapy, I was left with a knee that will only bend to about 90 degrees for the rest of my life.

Several years after the accident, had not healed properly and was essentially a dead bone that would have to be replaced. After putting the surgery off just long enough for me to finish college, I had it replaced last September only to find out a few months later that they have started recalling hip replacements like it is their job. 

So here I am 11 months after that hip replacement living in DC as a 23yr old with the joints of a 73yr old and I decided to celebrate my physical freedom with a nice bike ride up Mt Vernon Trail and through Rock Creek Park.

1374547911.0,1iuxvv,Remember the flipped car on Pennsylvania Avenue? We would love some help,OverflowingBubbles,118,15,30,"My sister and I are both from DC and have lived here (in DC proper) our entire lives and we would love some help.

A couple of days ago there was a picture of an overturned car on Pennsylvania Avenue (post: http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/1ikmz3/this_just_happened_at_22nd_and_penn_in_foggy/ imgur: http://i.imgur.com/9gUbFUX.jpg). My sister was the driver. She is okay

We have questions because there are some weird things going on. My sister and the passenger were working and on their way from one location to another of the company. She drives this route all the time. She was driving north-west on Pennsylvania when she heard/felt a hit from the back right. Next thing she knew they were flipping and she was screaming. They came to rest and miraculously both she and the passenger were fine. They had to hang there sideways for half an hour until the firemen got them out and took them to the hospital. 

Here's where the weird stuff begins. Both my sister and the passenger were completely coherent as they got to the hospital, as they were traveling north-west (look at the picture and you'll see that the front of the car is pointed towards the right, if they had been doing a u turn going NW, it would be towards the left). Today, a police officer stopped by our home and told my sister that his report said that she had been traveling south-east, which is definitely not true.

I understand that a lot of this stuff could be just how the police/firemen/EMTs/hospitals typically work

1363037524.0,1a3tf2,PSA For People Who Do Not Want To Get Their Bike Stolen,thekittening,106,7,36,"So there have been some posts recently about people having their bikes stolen... which is really not that surprising to me. I walk around the city every day and see people locking up their bikes in very careless fashions. I figured I'd post some tips about how to properly secure one's bike. Feel free to add whatever you think would help!

1) GET A PROPER LOCK. GET A PROPER LOCK. GET A PROPER LOCK. Don't use a cable lock. Those are crazy easy to snip through with a pair of wire cutters. What you want is a nice thick chain or a u-lock. My preference is for kyptonite locks. yes, you're pretty much set. you need the jaws of life to pry off one of these fuckers, and kryptonite will buy you a new bike if you can prove that it was the lock (and not WHAT you locked up to) that failed. kryptonite locks are also for life: they'll replace any lock that stops working. you can buy them in most reputable bike shops, or online at https://www.kryptonitelock.com


2) ONLY LOCK UP TO SECURE THINGS. do not lock up to trees. if you have a nice enough bike, lock and all, right off the post. same with most construction scaffolding: if it has bolts, it can be unbolted. do not lock up to the chain part of chain link fences. wire cutters make short work of chain link fences. do not lock up to bike racks without first making sure they are secured to something. do not lock up to parking meters without first making sure your lock cannot be slipped off of it (not so much a problem with u-lock, but definitely a problem with chains). do not lock up to other bikes. do not lock up to things that say ""do not lock your bike here"". do not lock up to anything by putting your lock JUST through your tire--it's not terribly hard to take that tire off for most bike thieves.

3) SPEAKING OF TIRES. It's not a bad idea to invest in a second lock (this CAN be a cable lock) to secure your front tire to your bike, seat, and handlebars. They discourage the casual hoodlum, although someone with a bunch of keys could probably find a way to steal your tire if they were really dedicated--the keys aren't all 100% individual.

4) DON'T LEAVE YOUR BIKE UNATTENDED FOR TOO LONG. I keep my bike in my bedroom, do not leave your bike locked to the same thing for more than a day or two. Bikes left lying around attract thieves.

5) Put the lock through the frame of the bike. Thieves can take off handlebars and tires.

6) If it can be removed, reflectors, lights, etc etc etc. Anti-theft bolts help, removing lights when you lock your bike helps, not leaving your bike in one place too long helps, and being careful where you park it helps

Edit: Things that other people have added

1) Get a lock for your back tire if it's quick release. 

2) Commute using CaBi

3) Keep a beater bike for rainy nights/if you're going to be out late

I waited for an hour by the broken off leash

She's a mostly black what I'm guessing to be a boxer-terrier mix

I'll keep her for a day or two

If anyone knows anything about this dog

If you're the owner; you should be ashamed of yourself. It's been three and a half hours. Vespa's a little sweetheart. Come get your dog

Edit- My roommate took some [pictures](http://imgur.com/a/Oi40L) of her. I've also posted her picture [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/1hi2yg/found_near_dupont_circle_dc_we_call_her_vespa/) in /r/aww hoping that someone not in this sub might recognize her. If you can think of any other reddit places I might find some help

**UPDATE:** I'm back at work, she'll make someone more deserving a very good pet.

**UPDATE2:** I decided to take Vespa to the Humane Society to see if she had a chip. (She did not.) I was planning on taking her home and keeping her for a few more days to continue the search, they were right. Her health comes first, so Vespa and I said our goodbyes.

I exhibit all the positive stereotypes. I can do multivariate calculus even while my brain is being eating by Hannibal Lecter (excuse the imagery), worship cows and kick the crap out of competitive exams. The only downside is I am not a Doctor. I am an Engineer with a postgraduate degree, but, that doesn't damn near enjoy the same respect. I also exhibit the highly desirable qualities of being irreverent, self-deprecating, self-loathing, condescending and complaining about irrelevant things like George Costanza. 

I strongly believe in the aphorism (see?) ""Be the roommate you want yours to be"". So, like most people, I can be fun in small doses. 

So, Rosslyn, East Falls Church), let me know. If you've always wanted to take a semester off while in college and volunteer in a 3rd world country, but, could not for whatever reason, you should definitely contact me. I am the closest thing to that experience you never had. I also use run-on sentences. Deal with it. 

I am willing to part with a little over 10 Benjamins per month on or before Oct. 1.

Original Post - http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/16k1g1/trying_to_locate_dc_breakers_gq_poppers_dancer/

Update Post #1 - http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/16qr58/update_trying_to_locate_dc_breakers_gq_poppers/

First Washington Post article - http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/wp/2013/01/15/do-you-know-the-d-c-breakdancer-in-this-painting/

Second Washington Post article - http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/going-out-guide/wp/2013/02/06/cool-disco-dan-documentary-connects-d-c-breakdancer-to-a-portrait-of-the-past/

The Washington Post article pretty much tells how I connected with California.  He's in a Breakdancing / DiscoDan documentary that will be played in a few weeks.  Maura contacted the person who created the documentary and from there contacted California.  Then I was given California's info and called him!  :D 

California actually remembered myself and my mother.  :-)  We talked about breakdancing back in the 1980s, and he goes,""CHARLES **** ?  I haven't heard from him in DECADES!  I'm glad he's doing well!""

I told him that he really was a big part of my childhood, and he's usually blown away by it and feels humbled that he touched so many lives.   I also told him he was probably a bit reason that I love dance music so much.  I don't remember any of the music he played while we were learning how to breakdance, but my mother did.  I told California this story -- one time I gave her a CD full of dance music and we were listening to it.  As we were listening to ""Somebody Else's Guy"" by Jocelyn Brown, my mother exclaims,""Wow, thanks for this CD, that is a song California used to play while you were in breakdancing classes and I never could figure the title or artist!""

I told California that he owns this painting and that I'm just storing it for him in the meanwhile.  I need to contact him again to make arrangements

If you all have any questions for me

My name is Deric and I started managing at Public Bar Tenly Town.  I work Tuesday nights from 6 until close

That's it.  It's just an FYI.

The address is:
4611 41st St NW

Alright

Food: As of now, it's typical sports bar food - burgers, fries, wings, salads, nachos, etc. We will have pizza when we get the new menu. (we have a real pizza oven!""

Beers: This is off the top of my head but on tap I believe we have: heiniken, guiniess, Sam Adams (noble pils), new castle, blue moon, peroni.

In cans we also have: Milwaukee's Best

We don't have any IPAs but we are going to work on that. Dogfish

The staff is super friendly and I'm pretty nice too. We have 20+ TVs and I can have 21 different channels.

But this is all nothing compared to one simple fact: We have motherfucking skeeball and we plan on having some motherfucking skeeball tournaments.

A few days ago I [asked](http://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/146cde/going_to_dc_for_an_interview_words_of_advice/) for some advice on traveling to DC for an interview. I apologize for making another self post in such a short amount of time (seems narcissistic)

- Followed the walk-left-stand-right rule at all times.

- I bought a farecard and panicked when it wouldn't let me get out of the station (turned out the card was like 5 cents short). There was a glass booth nearby with a lady in it. I tried to get her attention; no response. Rang the buzzer. She picked up a phone and started talking on it. I waited until she was done

- As soon as I got out of McPherson Square station, and a guy holding up a sign and yelling something at passersby. I think he was protesting something? Everyone else didn't bat an eye and kept walking. Guess they must be used to it.

- Stupid mistake: thought 14th St was the same thing as 1400

- There was so much construction going on!

- Took the recommendation of several people and ate at a place called Cosi. Wanted to share a nice story: I was initially confused about how the ""line"" there worked, and says, ""there's a line, you go here."" I thought he was annoyed at me (""damn tourists!"" sentiment, possibly). Then the guy does a complete 180 and asks, ""where are you from?"" I tell him Atlanta. ""Welcome to DC!"" he says. ""You'll love it here. It's a wonderful city."" He also wished me good luck on my interview. This type of thing just doesn't happen in Atlanta.

- Love the fact that so many people here wear sharp-looking suits.

- Watched the President light up the Christmas tree from a TV at the airport; a truly magical moment
