1332394758.0,r806v,Occult 101: What it is and where to start.,,103,7,42,"The majority of posts to [/r/occult](/r/occult) tend to be from those looking for information on occultism and sometimes where and how to begin study and practice. With that in mind

**What is occultism?**

The dictionary definition of ""occult"" means ""hidden"" or ""secret"". Occultism is the study of knowledge hidden or secreted away from the mainstream of society. However

To give some examples: In a classical setting this may refer to the teachings of the Mystery Schools of Egypt or Greece. In a tribal/pastoral setting it would be the knowledge held by shamans, occultism could be the psychonauts who explore the unknown regions of human consciousness and its untapped potential.

**Is it a religion?**

While some schools of occultism utilize or worship god-forms in their rituals, or even theology to which all occultists adhere to. Some occultists are quite devoted to a particular pantheon or god-form while some are completely atheistic. It goes without saying that we are not all Satanists or demon-worshipers out to steal your baby, slay your cat, or take over the world.

**What is magick?**

""the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity with Will""

This is the quote thrown at those who wish to understand magick though it barely explains anything. In simplistic terms, parapsychology, psychology, and convoluted models based on chaos theory and quantum physics. 

**Is it real?**

To quote Nick Dutch

Try some basic rituals and see what happens. Remember

[Other users have also tackled this subject](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/r5h8w/the_burden_of_proof/) if you care to read it.


**Where do I start?**

Read and then read some more. Feel free to ask questions, is to figure out what you are looking for. Are you interested in spiritual transformation or more interested in getting material results? Do you want to Rend the Veil of the Temple or pay homage to the Horned God and Lady of the Stars? Maybe you want to summon Cthulhu to give your asshole nightmares?

1363511208.0,1agh35,I just made a set of neurotransmitter correspondences/attributions for Crowley's tree of life. Thoughts? Critique?,raisondecalcul,54,6,26,"Hi guys. I had been using testosterone vs. dopamine to explain the feeling of Mars vs. Jupiter (respectively)

I made it by listing the major neurotransmitters, neurotransmitters, and drugs as I went. It was a lot like filling in a crossword puzzle; as I became certain of some attributions, it made it easier to work with the remaining neurotransmitters and sephiroth.

I am not very happy with the way the post-Renaissance planets (Uranus, it feels very wrong to put Pluto at Kether (instead, I put it in Chokmah's qliphoth, the capitalist bastard; but I don't use the qliphoth except for that so far.) But the planetary associations actually worked out pretty well in this chart, except maybe for Saturn (and the Moon, but actually opiods are a great fit, it's just they are mostly very dark because you shouldn't use drugs to get moon energy.)

Anyway, the Moon represents how most people use alcohol in western culture--as an escape from everyday life and a way to channel oppressed subconscious impulses. The other major ways we move out of day-to-day life are aptly described by the other two cards--the Universe inspires us to go jogging and get a runners high, transcending everyday life in the pursuit of Beauty, or towards terrible addiction and conflict with society; and the Aeon moves us towards weed, in resistance to culture (as opposed to using alcohol as an escape).

Here it is. I was surprised at how it fell into place--I used all of the major neurotransmitters exactly once.

|11 (Da'at)|Adrenaline &amp; noradrenaline|Uranus|Some antidepressants|Flight-or-fight response, panic, desperate aggression

Edit: Benzodiazapenes, and alcohol are the main drugs used as anxiolytics (anti-anxiety).

I am very interested hearing reactions to these attributions, and to explain the tree of life to neuroscientists, but I'm open to any and all critique :-).

So

Edit: I should add the testosterone is not a neurostransmitter, it crosses the blood-brain barrier as estrogen, and THAT masculinizes the brain during prenatal development. Edit: Woah, just realized that testosterone crosses the abyss to link to estrogen, as if the abyss were the blood-brain barrier. I'm now very satisfied with Estrogen's placement :-).

Edit: Forgot to add, it is interesting to note that the Column of Severity (left column) is all made up of categories of neurotransmitters/hormones, whereas the Column of Mercy (right column) is made up of all single neurotransmitters (I did not plan this). The center column, the Column of Mildness, is all single neurotransmitters except for Yesod (opiods is a category of neurotransmitters).

Edit: So

Benefits of this version:

* The center column now goes DMT-Serotonin (psychedelics)-Cannabinoids (weed)-GABA (alcohol and sedatives), and High Priestess cards up the balanced center of the tree.

* Mercury is now associated with acetylcholine (nicotine). The feeling of nicotine is very much about ""articulation."" Also

* For Netzach

* The moon has fewer negative connotations.

* The right column has glutamate (low-level excitatory neurotransmitter)-dopamine (rewarding)-and opiods (rewarding), so I feel an incongruity here still.

* All the major axiolytics (benzos, alcohol) are now in the center column.

Overall I think the first version is better

What do you think of this version? Let's compare the two :-).

Edit: Cortisol needs to go on here, depression, mourning), whereas adrenaline and noradrenaline are short-term stress hormones (fear, panic, aggression, rage).",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1agh35/i_just_made_a_set_of_neurotransmitter/

1339986400.0,v7dzy,Occultism 101: Types of Occultism pt 1 ,,53,4,24,"**Hermetics**

A syncretic system whose name is short-hand for the philosophical and temple teachings of Hellenistic Egypt. The central figure is that of Hermes Trismegitus - who is considered an incarnation of the gods Thoth (Tahuti) and Hermes - and the core teachings are his writings ""The Emerald Tablet"" and ""Corpus Hermeticum"".

The goal of Hermetic practice is enlightment through spiritual alchemy and theurgical ritual. There are also elements of practical magick and astrology involving the use of planetary talismans and horary charts. Hermetic magickal practices are the foundations for Renaissance European magick (via Agrippa) which went on to influence the Golden Dawn and ceremonial magick as a whole.

Strictly Hermetic groups tend to be occult groups of a ceremonial bent or esoteric orders. 

**Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (Ceremonial Magick)**

Combining elements of Hermetics, and Renaissance European magick, the Golden Dawn system is the foundation for most of what constitutes Western Occultism and ""high magick"". The Golden Dawn used a grade system similar to a fraternal lodge where the initiate progresses after demonstrating knowledge, ability, and the willingness to undertake various oaths of secrecy.  

The Golden Dawn teachings involve an intensive study of the Qabalah, Jewish, Hellenistic, and Egyptian myth and symbolism. The goal of this path is spirtual perfection and the attainment of life goals.

There are a plethora of orders and groups still operating under the Golden Dawn name. Unfortunately

**Thelema**

The tradition founded by Aleister Crowley. Crowley

The Book is the source the infamous axiom ""Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the law."" This has been erroneously translated to ""do whatever you want"". In fact, inherent in every individual. The term can also be found in the commonly quoted definition of magick: ""The art and science of causing change in conformity with Will"". 

Thelemic cosmology has multiple god-forms, and Ra-Hoor-Khuit (The Crowned and Conquering Child). Other gods mentioned in Thelemic rituals and works are Pan, Choronzon, Harpocrates, and Babalon, the Sacred Whore and her beastly mount Therion.

As Crowley was a GD intiate, and various elaborate rituals for the intiate to master. Crowley was antagonistic to the church, so he removed a lot of Judeo-Christian language and symbolism from the rituals and replaced them with references to Thelemic cosmology. He also developed his own tarot deck, the ""Thoth"" deck, and wrote a companion book - The Book of Thoth - which is considered a classic text on the tarot. Thelema also places utilizes Eastern methods of mysticism and self-mastery like yoga, tantra, buddhist meditation

The goal of Thelema is knowing and being in alignment with your True Will. This is done through many methods, is seen as the initiate's guide to knowing their True Will.

The two main organizations currently active in Thelema are the Ordo Templi Orientis and the A.'. A.'..

**Chaos Magick**

Chaos Magick is a system of magickal thought developed in the late 70's and into the early 80's by Peter J. Carroll and Ray Sherwin. CM borrows heavily from the DIY and anti-authoritarian ethos of punk rock, chaos theroy, and the work of artist and occultist Austin Osman Spare.

Chaos Magick is practical, overall, are not important to most Chaotes as they are with traditional high magicians. The principals behind CM are ""belief-shifting"", ""belief as a tool"", gnosis. 

Belief-shifting is the idea of utilizing all methods of magick regardless of the contradictions they may hold against each other for examples. These contradicitons are mitigated by the philosophy of ""belief as a tool"" or that the emotional and psychological investment in the ritual is more important than the words or actions performed. Gnosis is an altered state of consciousness likened to the Buddhist concept of ""samadhi"" in which the meditator achieves union with the Buddha-mind via complete mental vacuity. It is believed that the gnostic state of mind is where magick ""happens"". There are two kinds of gnostic trance: inhibitory and exciatory. The former is associated with sleeplessness, and hypnotic states. The later is associated with more active modes of trance like drumming, dance, sexual arousal, and flagellation. 

Carroll and Sherwin opened a fraternal order called the Illuminates of Thanateros which is one of the few magickal orders still heavily active today. The order has five degrees with initiate advancement based on demonstration of knowledge and ability. However

**Neo-Paganism**

Mostly associated with Wicca, Neo-Shamanism, and various forms of contemporary Goddess theology. Neo-Pagans often stress that their path's are a religion first and a method of magick second. Neo-Paganism could also include traditions outside of the West such as Chinese folk religion or the various syncretic religions of Japan.

Neo-Pagans are the most visible and active members of the occult community. Most Unitarian Universalist churches have an ""Earth-Based Spirituality"" meeting group and there are dozens of large-scale festivals and celebrations that take place only a few hours away from even the remotest small town. There is also a cottage industry of publishers, one could even say there is a whole city dedicated to it: Salem, Massachusetts. 

Outside of Druidism and Heathenry, or even Thelema. Druidism and Heathenry, however, are ""reconstructionist"" traditions that attempt to rebuild the old religious practices of a particular culture. In the case of Heathenry, it's the religion of the pagan Norse. In Druidism, that of the Iron Age Celtic priesthood. 

Most Wiccan groups tend to be private covens, and The Order of Bards, Ovates, and Druids in the U.K..  For Heathenry, there is The Ring of Troth and the Asatru Alliance both of which are based in the United States.

Here's what I was told to work with: 

 - http://www.occultofpersonality.net/

 - &gt;I tend towards darker themes

 - &gt;I opt for red and black or purple and black

 - &gt;A nice rich dark purple and black would look fantastic. Perhaps some images from old Hermetic texts or grimoires

 - &gt;This question was put to the Oracle and the answer is ...Tetragrammaton as the main symbol (this is the current background)

Now obviously who made which comments isn't important and I'm not trying to say they were out of line for suggesting that. It's just not really that easy to make a nice-looking red and purple and black theme on a subreddit.

One person i've really been interested in is Rupert Sheldrake and his study of morphogenetic fields. I've listened to his lectures on youtube and heard about his experiements with dogs who know when there owners are coming home. i wanted this to be true

Recently i've actually read dogs who know when there owners are coming home and got a chance to look at the study in finer detail. The whole idea of the experiments being pseudoscientifc were wrong, that sounded like he had everything well thought out and followed the scientific method exactly as you were supposed to. if you read the book, it seems pretty cut and dry and not people just making stuff up or faking it. We'll guess what, even with all that, its still not good enough for the skeptics. 

I've also been looking into a lot of other studys on the paranormal like telpathy, the other was not shown blinking lights and was meditating on the intent of non local communication. they looked at the two people brainwave lead out at they matched up over 70% way beyond the margin of error. there apparently is a lot of experiements i found that do show some evidence of the paranormal

so why isnt this making news? why are they still clinging so hard to their worldview. perhaps these militant skeptics arent as neutral and objective as they claim to be

or theres dean radins study on the ghanzfeld experiment which were also very well laid out. skeptic susan blackmore kept asking to further and further tighten the experiment

It seems to me now that the militant atheists and cynical skeptics are not quite as neutral, just the dawkins and randi types. it seems perfectly clear they will reject anything thats associated with the paranormal or doesnt fit into the materialist paradigm regardless of how compelling the evidence is. so looking into this the idea of people calling these types of skeptics dogmatic, is looking more and more plausible. and science itself is not what is dogmatic, its just a method of inquiry, but people hide beyond the label and power of science to make their subjective claims appear to be objective. 

the worst part about the dogmatic skeptic phenomenon is these people dont seem to be interested in figuring out what is actually going on in the universe

true skepticism should never be mistaken for close mindedness and cynicism. afterall, magic and so forth. suprising your r/atheist type redditor probably doesnt know that much more about science than the average person. end of rant

Science for awhile, and skeptics would counter it. 

But then one day, and that is ""where the fuck does consciousness come from"". Yes neurology does explain that our emotions are connected to chemical reactions and our memories are stored in certain temporal lobes and how brain damage can destroy them. However, science never has, and i dont think they ever will, why we a random collection of organized atoms are self aware. Skeptics argue against this, saying you can program a robot to feel, processs info, create art

Isnt that the most peculiar thing? A bunch of carbon atoms, one, consciousness is a property inherant in all matter, or consciousness is something that exists outside of matter. I cant conceive of any other way, yet science says no and yes to both at the same time. This lead me to realize that sciences view of conciousness is totally paradoxical, even nonsensical. It says, no atoms are not conscious, yet all we are made of these billiard balls according to science

The more i think about physicalism, there really is no such thing as solid matter anyway, its made of waves of energy.

Ever since I first learned about magick I always wondered if there was some way to utilize computers.

I was pretty disappointed when the Chaos Magicians who were the most likely candidates for coming with something like this but didn't get around to it.

The computer and the internet have completely changed society and many many domains of it but magick seems untouched by it other then the released of wast works that are hard to decipher and are severely weakened without initiation. Although they did create more powerful and easy systems as a result.

I know there is cybermancers out there but they more utilize the concepts as a system of belief akin to the Matrix movie rather then the tool itself.

So what I'm asking is if any of you have ideas or sites or programs that utilize the power of the computer and the internet to power up magick?

I also have a great idea guys.(famous last words)

You all know how sigils work

My idea is to have a place where we can all power each others sigils on a you scratch my back I scratch yours

Everyone can power the sigils however they think best

I believe I entered a dream, I began to feel the most intense vibration I've ever experienced in my head.  It felt like it was going to vibrate out of this plane of existance (if that makes any sense).  My vision began to blur and I saw random faces, shapes, etc. Then the intense vibration spread throughout the rest of my body, and I could feel it especially in my hands.  The best way to describe the feeling was an intense electrical energy coursing through my veins, to the point where it consumed my entire being. (Granted, it didn't feel like an electric shock).  
Then I began walking around with this intense feeling still at full force, vibrational tint to it, basically it seemed very different from real life, though it was hard to distinguish completely between the two.  I began noticing that the energy seemed to pulse out of my body at my chakras and hands.  I then made my way to the bathroom when I decided to see if the energy pouring from my body could influence the world.  I put my had near the door knob and much to my surprise the energy poured out and moved the door without my touching it.  Amazed at this, I got another intense vibration in my head and the next thing I know I am slowly waking up in my room again.

In this video you will see a reclusive Taoist neigong master.

He is the heir to a 2500 year old Taoist Neigong school/system called ""Mo Pai""

There are rumored to be 10 such schools alive today.

Neigong means internal energy mastery (pronounced nay gung)

He never once charged any of his students a dime nor accepted donations from them. The same applied to his patients. He was oath bound not to charge or profit in any way from his practice.

Since this video aired he has retired and the school was closed to western students.

He is now training as a recluse.

In this video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MoOgZsQGQpA

Catherine Nixon Cooke of the Mind Science Foundation

Dr. Roger Nelson M.D.

Dr. Greg Simpson - Physicist from (at that time) New York's Albert Einstein University

He is checked for metal in his body and stripped to a shirt before testing begins.

Home video of his student Jim McMillian passing his level 3 exam: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKuXuDCPfds

Earlier footage of him from the 80's: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pg16FenuHmI

If would like more information there are two books by Chang's student Kosta Danaos (The Magus of Java

Also the most advanced western student Jim McMillian recently wrote a book available on amazon (Seeking the master of mo pai)

For anyone who still thinks this is BS. The mo pai neigong meditation is very similar to a very well documented school called Buddhist Tummo or (inner fire meditation)

http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2002/04.18/09-tummo.html *During visits to remote monasteries in the 1980s, raise the temperatures of their fingers and toes by as much as 17 degrees. It has yet to be determined how the monks are able to generate such heat.*

Wim Hof from the netherlands is one of the few non monks to have mastered Tummo. He holds more cold endurance records than any other person being packed in ice for 72 minutes to emerge hot to the touch

Look him up on youtube there are hundreds of videos of him.

1329289503.0,pqfd6,"Dream contact with beings which many people would think of as ""space aliens""",JumboColoringBook,30,2,12,"There's a great thread going on at /r/ufos right now (http://www.reddit.com/r/UFOs/comments/pp5s2/ive_been_having_amazing_and_in_depth_dreams_about/)

It has inspired me to write down some curious things that have been happening to me over the past 5 months or so. I'm going to cross-post what I wrote there so maybe some of you (non-ufo/alien biased) guys can lend your two cents.

When I was a kid I had a few hallucinations/dreams/don'tknow events that involved small orangey-brown treasure troll looking people in robes being in my bedroom, which of course lead to the abduction phenomena, and then down a bunch of diverging topics ranging from youtube videos warning of fallen angels, some of Aleister Crowley's work, to (imo) very loopy new age topics. I read it all while still trying to keep an objective mind, but I eventually started to figure that despite credible evidence like (well vetted) video and radar reports and Disclosure Project testimony, there was some much less physical aspects to the topic from what many people assume.

Within the past year my interest in the topic had gotten to a considerable point so one day while walking outside, I can't handle that, contact me in my dreams."" I have no idea what telepathy is or how to do it, but given what other people have said about this sort of thing, it seemed like the best way. I guess it's more like taking an entire intention or thought and packaging it into a single pulse, rather than stringing together words and sentences like a vocal language.
Well, they all began with me, looking through my own eyes, standing in a particular place, often a low lit empty room of metal or grey stone substance. And I have always been able to wake from these dreams with a very vivid memory of the entire thing.
The first dream involved a typical short alien ""grey"" who embraced me in a hug. I sort of felt a vibrating feeling or a dematerialization of my body around my mind and said, but a little creepy.

The second dream occurred about a week later. I was standing in a room, but instead of indulging my curiosity and going toward it, I got creeped out and woke up. At this point I started sharing my stories on reddit, mostly this ufo sub. A guy private messaged me and warned me that they were demons, don't engage, invoke the name of Jesus if it happens again, etc.

So when the 3rd dream like this began, but instead of being friendly I shouted to get back, Jesus Christ this, honesty that. Because, frankly, I was scared from too many creepy conspiracy theories and horror abduction accounts. I'm very curious about all this stuff about contact with nonhuman intelligences, but my frightening childhood experiences has really colored my expectations of all this. Another big sticking point is a potential connection to a being Aleister Crowley claimed to have contacted: http://www.boudillion.com/lam/lam.htm ...Which isn't necessarily bad by itself but it's a little too creepy to handle right now personally.

Honestly, but this time instead of a stark empty room and a short grey dude, I was in what seemed to be a reception or lounge type of place. The room was round and had windows on all sides giving way to a wide view of perfect blue sky. There was comfortable furniture and many plants filling up the space. And on the opposite side of this seating area was a being who I can best describe as a yellow-skinned slender woman (I'm guessing woman, it was a female voice but no other characteristics like a bust under her clothing for instance), with white hair combed back over her large head, and large eyes that slitted vertically instead of horizontally like on our human faces. In retrospect, it seems these beings decided to put on a ""prettier"" face for me, Noel, almost giggling with my answers. I kissed her on the cheek at one point and she said ""I read in books what that means for you people"" to which I replied, but it may be of note that instead of waking abruptly from this one as I had previously

A couple of interesting things I've come across since then:
-The troll people I saw when a child are a really close match to the short aliens from the movie ""Communion."" Mine didn't have such ugly faces
-I told the Noall story to a friend of mine
-I looked up the word ""andromedan"" in google images and was pretty damned surprised at what other people say they look like.
-Rather recently, a white squashed marshmallow looking object appeared in the clear blue sky, and went over the sky and into some clouds while traveling in a lazy S sort of a path. I thought out a hardy ""Thank you! Let's talk in my dreams again some time!"" Though, I have not had anything of this sort happen to me since (about a month ago).

I have a few conclusions I can make about all this:
-It's bunk and I've been doped up on BS sci-fi hoaxers and claims crazy people make; this is all a result of wishful thinking and coincidence.
-There are intelligences who wish to make contact with humans and are (at least on the surface) much less scary than Unsolved Mysteries has lead us to believe.
-There are multiple types of intelligences that make contact with humans for varying reasons
-The human mind can be compartmentalized to the point of giving a separate personality to what would be perceived as a separate being,False,self,t5_2qhmc,False,,,t3_pqfd6

Some of these files are found in other places of course (like the well known occult text hosting services). However I have gathered a bunch from torrents

I have indexed all of these files into a single notepad (.txt) file and uploaded it to dropbox, some of the file names are long and go to multiple lines, so being able to fullscreen in notepad seems  to provide better viewing.

1375110105.0,1ja25v,Laws of Magick - computational reference,dirk_bruere,34,5,29,"The list is below. I put it together not because I believe it but because this is a good summary of what many people involved in magick believe. Like in Chaos magick


Appendix C – The Laws of Magick

These are culled from various sources and included for reference. While I have attempted a complete list it is probable that some have been omitted or overlooked. In no particular order:

Law of Contagion – once two objects have been in contact a permanent link is established between them.

Law of Similarity – like affects like.

Law of Association – if two objects have features in common they interact via those features

Law of Names – knowing the true name of something or someone gives the knower power over it/them.

Law of Identification – assuming some or all of the characteristics of an entity or phenomenon will create insights into its nature.

Law of Knowledge – with understanding comes power and control. This is a truism in all endeavors.

Law of Words of Power – the use of specific words to evoke a defined effect or mental state in the speaker or listener.

Law of Opposites – a synthesis of opposites will yield a third way that is not a compromise of the original two. Used in mysticism to hold opposite views or ideas in order to generate new insights. For example

Law of Polarity – all phenomena can be divided into at least two opposing aspects. For example

Law of Balance – this corresponds to the Middle Way in Buddhism and is used to keep the practitioner centered.

Law of Infinite Data – there is an infinity of information. 

Law of Finite Apprehension – we can only access a finite quantity of information.

Law of Infinite Views – every observer sees a different reality

Law of Creation – we create our own reality

Law of Pragmatism – Truth is determined by utility

Law of Cause and Effect – doing the same thing under the same conditions will produce the same result

Law of Self Similarity – reality is fractal and self similar on all scales. In other words

Law of Synchronicity – there is no such thing as coincidence.

Law of Personification – any phenomenon may be considered to be alive and have a personality

Law of Unity – all phenomena

Some of the laws have obvious parallels in programming languages
others are going to need a more creative approach

It seems more and more obvious that basically all human/political/economic/logistical systems are pretty much top heavy and loaded with obsolete

I am not looking for a political discussion necessarily
Whoever pays them most etc. What's telling is that at this point all stripes of political persuasion agree *something* is very wrong. 15 years ago much of our problems were ""conspiracy theories"". That is rapidly changing. 

People are being herded into their avatars. Now in 50-60 years this may indeed payoff but for now

We have the ""race for the cure"" for breast cancer
Cancer that cancer but we do not have a sustained educational message informing people what is most likely to cause cancer because this information would be detrimental to large corporations that make food as well as damage the influx of people

So there may indeed be cures on the horizon for many things but at the same time, chemically diseased foods, etc.

Same with society being sucked into this (for now) pin prick sized hole of the virtual. Line up and get your awkward clunky avatars kids!

At some point avatar culture
World will be mind bending. But the truly advanced and progressive realms of the virtual will also sit atop a massive hierarchy.

We can easily make a PKD type gnostic argument about archons and matrices

In the words of the venerable millionaire lebowski ""the god damn plane has crashed into the mountain"".

I guess my question is: what does it look like to you? What is the way out?

Or is it really an entrance? Are we perhaps entering back into a more sidereal astral realm via technology?

In other words are we being freed and enlightened or processed

Ramsay Dukes ""virtual reality"" perspective comes to mind as does the tibetan Buddhist viewpoint. Quantum physics is leading us to an untapped world of total potential

It's obviously natural to fear this level of total
Technological
Integration.

But I think the reason why many fear it so is because since the beginning of recorded history
Of human society has functioned on the premise of fear, debt and lack. It is in direct opposition to the wasteful abundance of natures way.

As we as both individuals and societies reach our maximum human limits in the realm of information
and obligation management, past our limited natural boundaries in that a potential is being requested of us that we literally cannot at this time *afford* to manifest. So either humans must change or the meta-foundations of what we really ""owe"" must change. I say it will be a lot of both...but when? How?

There simply aren't enough hours in the day to continue to casually adopt more as more faux needs

The whole thing is maxed and here we are on the potential cusp of ""post-scarcity"" which is the exact opposite of how human culture has always been managed and it is my opinion that the corporate/governmental/banking dr.science.priests are fully aware of this liminal realm we are floating in hence all the draconian ""the customer is our enemy our competitor is our friend"" laws being passed everywhere.

I guess my take is, as a matter of course, enslave us.

Which is what everyone is really feeling.

Since I've began, usually. In any case, this year has been marked by Atu XI, as everything has been in this amazing upswing. I lived in an income sharing community and learned many valuable lessons; had a Divine Moment of Truth; I got to go on an amazing and fantastic bicycle trip with some of my favorite comrades; I was randomly invited to live in a highly desirable artist/performer community; got a wonderful and easy job as a bicycle courier; am giving a presentation on my earthly practical studies at a festival/gathering; have found many new interesting, open-eyed friends; have taken up new hobbies; have a couple of business models bubbling in the cauldron; and have on the day-to-day observed many minor synchronicities, reconnections, and gifts from the universe. Many of these things seemingly just fell into my lap

What I have learned is that any experience, much like a language of its own. Indeed, the language of experience. The language of life. Yet this language is universal in quality. It has been the it utmost faithful companion: it has alerted me of my follies, both in my endeavors and attitudes. It has also facilitated acute awareness of opportunities and dangers. I often approach it actively, focuses here in the present, to find obscure perspectives to assist me in my choices. I have found that attachments to outcome interfere with experiencing the raw awesomeness of magick.

1). I turned to tarot after the breakup of a recent relationship. It was pretty brutal; I wanted hope and a reason to believe it could work, no. I hated that message at the time but, in my opinion, it turned out to be accurate. A reader with much more experience later returned the same verdict.

2). I started keeping a dream journal and, since we'd broken up. Later on in the same dream I was on an island that people were telling me would flood, but I wouldn't get off of it. At the time a breakup seemed impossible, but all of this eventually came to pass; and while I know this is hardly the stuff of miracles, it was very meaningful to me.

In other significant dreams I saw Ganesh

3). I turned to the saints for help during this relationship. I'd heard that they could be effective in granting your petitions (as long as they were consistent with theirs), I think it's very likely that we would've ended earlier and more peacefully had I let it die gracefully. The relationship 'exploded' at the end, when it became clear it had been dragging on too long. Note: when I turned to them for help at the end, this time, the message was finally 'no.'

4). I briefly experienced astral projection in a dream. I 'woke up' inside of my body, in blackness. I was only able to process it for a few seconds before I freaked out (where am I? what's holding me up???) and sort of 'vibrated' out of it; and that was the end of that.

The idea of ego comes from psychoanalysis

Ego is the portion of personality which *mediates* between *id*, generosity, patience, forgiveness and so on.  These ideal qualities represent or form the super-ego.  And reality is the notion that the world is external and physically regulated.  So for example, if you stick your hand into the fire and it burns, that's reality.  Reality is the ""harsh"" world ""out there.""  And conventionally most people probably do find the world to be both external and harsh.  And finally, ego is what *balances* these three concerns: id

So in psychoanalytic terms, then perhaps you can talk about dropping ego.  And keep in mind, if you drop your ego you still have the id and super-ego which aren't dropped. :)  Would you drop id and the super-ego as well?  All of this seems profoundly misguided in most scenarios, if not outright crazy.

Now let's look at ego in more metaphysical terms.  Is ego complex or simple?  In other words, it's simple.  But if ego is composed of parts, isn't it better to talk about these parts individually?  For example, *if* (if!) ego is greed + lust, and you still maintain lust at the same level but reduced your greed, then it's not informative to talk about dropping or not dropping ego.  It's not specific enough.  It's much better to say, ""I am now less greedy than I used to be.""  That's informative because it's specific.  If your mind recognizes a reduction in greed

And if ego is not something complex

What would you rather hear when discussing spiritual concerns:

""I've become less greedy"" OR ""I am less egoistic.""

""I've learned to be more patient."" OR ""I am less egoistic.""

""I've learned to keep an open mind.""  OR ""I am less egoistic.""

""Praise and blame no longer move me as they used to 5 years ago.""  OR ""I am less egoistic""

""I no longer view the world as external.  I don't feel that the subject/object distinction is informative or meaningful.""  OR ""I am less egoistic.""

Personally I'd much prefer the expressions on the left for two reasons.  One, it's possible to become less greedy while still being very much attached to praise and blame.  So because these qualities can change individually without much affecting each other, it's much better and more skillful to talk about them individually instead of giving them an umbrella term ""ego.""

So in conclusion

So what do you think?  Am I making any sense?  Have you ever been confused with the talk of ego like I have been?  Perhaps there are good and bad ways to use the word ""ego"" in conversation?  If yes,False,self,t5_2qhmc,1363840191.0,,,t3_1apmmp

If we're going to move forward (and I hope we are!) we need

1. People! Including beginners

2. A broad agreement about what specific path to follow. I was thinking we could pick 3 or 4 basic ""text books, Greer's Paths of Wisdom and Regardie's big Golden Dawn book?) with individuals able to craft a specific plan by either following one to the letter or combining aspects

Hello /r/occult

I've chosen to apply myself through a weird intersection of magic, indistinct ways to connect them.

The internet is an amazing resource that allows ideas to spread and people to learn in the blink of an eye. These give me such hope for the future and I want to help as much as I can.

So i've been working on my own evocation for the past few weeks. Essentially the idea is to bring up some local entities of nature to come by and sit with me for a bit. Last night i had two takers

So i invoked and sat there for several minutes, with long skinny arms and legs, skinny neck and a large bulbus head. Its limbs and neck were far too skinny to be human and it would clearly have been several feet taller than me if it'd been standing. It had a greenish hue around the edges.

Its form was not very static either. I asked it what it was and it gestured towards the candle. I asked if it was a being of fire and it...shrugged

The second presented itself to me (while the other was still sitting across from me) as some kind of old warrior spirit, but something seemed wrong...almost like it was trying to tell me something it thought i wanted to hear. I became suspicious, and demanded that if it was speaking falsely, it come forth and be truthful or leave.

When i asked it to be truthful, and promptly performed my banishing.

In retrospect

UPDATE: Consensus seems to be that I called up a Genius Loci and some kind of weak trickster. For thing 1, but i'll probably just leave it alone unless it comes back.

I'll try out the ritual a few more times on my own and then post it here for you guys to try. I should have time to do it again next week sometime. Honestly i'm pumped by the first run.

Explained here: http://redd.it/10p2m7

**Hitsuki Shinji comes from the Japanese tradition of respect for the ancestors and nature, etc?**

Historically

**How did the *Hitsuki Shinji* appear? What is the context?**

Explained here: http://youtu.be/v-z5zjCvZ5I Even though Nakaya-sensei's opinions on this use spiritual terms

## FAQs: Stuff that's not in the vlog series... yet

**What sort of stuff can be found in the *Hitsuki Shinji*?**

That's a big question...

It's a revelation from the God of Abraham and calls on Japanese people to conform to the ""Great Way"" of the world. It says that Japan will have a big role to play in the future and people will regret it if they don't adhere to divine principles.

It contains tons of prophecies about a coming economic and spiritual crisis, and a population crash; one notable line states that ""all things will become one-third"" of their former size. It says that human beings were led astray from the traditional paths by occult forces, and need to be put right.

It explains the nature of the spiritual world and how it is that revelations are made.

I am doing research into alternate histories of ancient Japan which claim to be written hundreds or thousands of years before the official histories Kojiki and Nihon Shoki. The *Hitsuki Shinji* incorporates these and seems to explain why they were created. Feel free to ask me about these documents as well

**How popular is this?**

It's a major subject of the Japanese occult blogosphere and I see it all the time on Twitter

**Why is there nothing written about this in English?**

That's kind of a mystery to me, that very little has made it into English despite its very real relevance to occult research.

**Are there books about this subject written by skeptics/other people?**

There are only a handful of departments of religious studies in Japan, but there is no study of latter-day occult research circles in Japan as there is in America, so there's really no interest. You can find a list of other authors who talk about it [on Japanese Wikipedia](http://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5%E6%9C%88%E7%A5%9E%E7%A4%BA#.E5.8F.82.E8.80.83.E6.96.87.E7.8C.AE).",,False,self,t5_2qhmc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/10rg21/ama_shinichi_nakaya_researcher_of_the_japanese/

My intuition has led me to the GD

I made sure to perform these rituals with a clear head and no expectations. When I had finished, I felt particularly light in weight. Like my legs and feet didn't weigh as much, making it easier to walk. That is enough evidence for me to continue. It seems that I began this post with no real point, and that I am probably just using this subreddit to express my findings, as anything occult isn't anything I like to converse about with the people that surround me daily.

1364326196.0,1b266a,Collective consciousness and psychic dreams,mrsnakers,29,4,26,"I think I'm strangely tied to collective consciousness. It's hard to explain but I have a few examples I'd like to share. The examples I have are really minor at times and some are a more intense. A week or so ago I posted [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/occult/comments/1algze/spirit_animals/) about my recent experiences with hawks. These sort of syncronistic occurrences are mostly tied to dreams and happen to me every few days

A few weeks ago I dreamed Steve Irwin met me in a dream. He was very nice and he told me he had decided to allow Animal Planet to air his death video, had such negative final words. I woke up feeling very emotional about it, wrote it down, went to work, got on reddit and my front page was filled with subs commemorating him as apparently that day was his birthday.

My grandfather had been diagnosed with cancer and had been living for 5 months with it and according to the doctors possibly had a year left. In December I had a dream that he was going to die very soon and very quick, his decline was so quick very similar to the dream. I have an identical similar story about my Grandmother, his wife, who had died 3 years prior, had been living with cancer for months, I had the dream she died, within days of that one she declined and died.

When I was in college I had a dream that I was in a school room, and proceeded to walk up to me and put a silenced uzi of some kind up to my face. I went into an absolute invincible feeling, no fear, only oneness. I stared into the gunman's eyes and he knew the presence of the eternal and broke down into tears, walked out into the hallway on some sort of suicide mission and was blown away by gunfire from the police. I woke up, went to class, went to lunch, it was Virginia Tech. 

I have dreamed of every girl I've ever had a relationship with, before either of us knew the person. He was far far off from who I would have ever imagined her, a sweet young skinny beautiful wealthy girl going for, a fat alcoholic old balding punk rocker (she's not with him anymore if anyone cares).

One time while driving to a nearby city at 1am I approached a major patch of fog. I was getting very sleepy and desperate to get home and decided to go through the fog without slowing. There were no cars and it was a country highway. I had been in the left lane the entire 1.5 hour drive, the merge itself caused me to almost gracefully weave around one of the biggest bucks I have ever seen, much taller than my car. I slowed down my car and looked in my mirror, watching it watch back at me. It was very surreal. I would have nailed him if I hadn't gotten in the right lane in that very moment. 

I dreamed one of my good friends from highschool died while hanging out with another friend of mine Charles, which I had no idea they knew each other or that Matt even lived there, and he explained that he had seen Matt before with a bunch of really fucked up girls at a party and they were looking for heroin. Matt had never done it, let alone any drugs really he was top of our class and a football star who was working to get his PhD, but was so blacked out drunk that he was just laughing saying ""yeah let's do drugs!"". They apparently shot him up while he was passed out and he died. Had I not made the phone call due to the dream, no one would have known that. I was able to tell his closest friends how he actually died, they told me not to tell his parents because they would have been very ashamed and they probably already knew since they saying his death was caused by asthma.

I've had dreams where I've fought demons. They've come to me and tried to trick me by telling me they had secrets for me

Yesterday, they did this so well, they captured it so perfectly but was it just a thing of the 90s? Is this a sound that still resonates with people, how could they twist it into something for 2013?"" Then I get on facebook today and my top story is [this](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/billy-corgan-starts-writing-next-smashing-pumpkins-album-20130326) with the first line ""Yesterday was the ""first official day of writing"" for the band's new album"".

Today I was talking to my Dad trying to convince him that he should go to a music festival in Gulf Shores Alabama called ""The Hangout"". I showed him that the headliner this year was Stevie Wonder, and he was like ""man that would have been awesome too!"" then less than 20 seconds later ""Higher Ground"" plays on the radio by Red Hot Chili Peppers, a Stevie Wonder cover.

Basically, seeing them the next day. Simple stuff like remembering a certain dish that I love and having someone call me the next day asking me if I was go grab it with them. A lot of it is pretty mindless, inconsequential stuff but even then, it just reminds me that there is definitely something greater, at least on my end. I think I have a window into some other side where time isn't relative. Is there something I should maybe be doing with this? I do dream journals occasionally and I meditate sometimes and sometimes I do yoga but it's definitely a small part of my life at this point. I don't summon anything / don't practice much except a little bit of mental alchemy, however you define it. Any advice as to what you would do if you were in my position? Things I should be careful of?",,self,,

The interesting thing, profit motivates the medical profession in the US, roughly 1/4 of all personal bankruptcies are due to medical bills.

Part 5- The Book of The Void:

The Ni To Ichi Way of strategy is recorded in this the Book of the Void.

What is called the spirit of the void is where there is nothing. It is not included in man's knowledge. Of course the void is nothingness. By knowing things that exist

People in this world look at things mistakenly

In the Way of strategy

To attain the Way of strategy as a warrior you must study fully other martial arts and not deviate even a little from the Way of the warrior. With your spirit settled, and sharpen the twofold gaze perception and sight. When your spirit is not in the least clouded, when the clouds of bewilderment clear away, there is the true void.

Until you realize the true Way, if we look at things objectively, from the viewpoint of laws of the world, we see various doctrines departing from the true Way. Know well this spirit, and with forthrightness as the foundation and the true spirit as the Way. Enact strategy broadly, correctly and openly.

Then you will come to think of things in a wide sense and

In the void is virtue, the Way has existence, spirit is nothingness.

This is an area of high interest to me since I'm classified as an ""anal retentive"" person. It's funny, I do feel how my muscles contract whenever something beyond my control happens, usually negative (tightening means attempt at control). Obviously, the more ""stuck up"" you are, the less fun you're having, and it can be detrimental to many things, from feeling comfortable to operating properly.

The most practical approach I have found is that whenever I'm feeling tense

I'm not sure, for example). And no matter how good you are at concealing or controlling that tension, the body still reacts first. I'm of the belief that it can be tamed to do otherwise, but some methodology must be established first. Anyone have similar experiences/thoughts?

I have been studying the subject for some time now and feel that I know enough to give at least an introduction on the topic. If there is enough interest I would like to compile a summary of my main source, Kundalini, and Mantra over to the West. It is a beast of a book but it always had this special little extra glint of light on it, sitting in my book case begging me to read it. Read it I have and it has changed me and my understanding of the world in many ways. Not many books have that power.

Topics that I could potentially cover:

**Disembodied Consciousness**

Brahman (undifferentiated consciousness)

Shiva-Shakti (consciousness as the static background to active power

Maya (veiling consciousness that produces the illusion of separateness)

Nada (the first movement of the sound ""AUM"" creating the universe)

Shabda (sound in any one of its 4 aspects)

Mantra (an aspect of sound)

The Universe as being composed of Mantra

ParaBindu (the ultimate point)

Devatas (loosely ""Angels"" but not really)

Atman (the big soul)

Jiva (the little soul)

Yoga (union of the two)


**Embodied Consciousness**

Prakriti and the 3 Gunas (these terms are essentially equivalent. They are qualities of consciousness in its dynamic aspect. They are Rajas, very similar to the alchemists' Sulfur, Mercury, and Salt. Everything in the Universe is created from these three qualities in differing proportions)

The Tattvas (various levels of consciousness, and therefore Matter, that arise from Prakriti, for example Ahamkara is related to the ego and is called the ""I-maker"" because it poses the sensory input fed to it from the Tanmatras, or the archetypal senses, etc)

The 5 Bhutas (Ether, Water, Earth)

Kundalini (the serpent power in its various aspects of creation)

Relation to quantum physics

**Cakra

What are the 7 Chakras

Properties of each Chakra: its bija-mantra, its representative animal, its Tattva, its Mandala, its location

A description of the human nervous system in relation to the 7 Chakras

The 3 main Nadis or conduits of pranic energy: Pingala

Story time!

I've always appreciated native american culture and the lore surrounding it but I'd never really considered the idea of a spirit animal to be a very real thing, get a very surreal feeling every time I see a hawk. Since November 2012 I've been going through some intense changes and struggles dealing with loss from death and from losing a three year relationship among other things. One day in December I decided it was time to really make a change in my life and better myself. I quit drugs, alcohol, caffeine, video games and started to go to the gym and meditate more. One day, while leaving the gym, I was feeling really good about myself for one of the first times since the difficult things started happening and I heard a rustling in a bush that I had just walked by. I turned around to watch an absolutely beautiful hawk fly out of the bush and soar off into the sky. I felt extreme frisson and almost a dream like state.

I remembered all of these strange times in my life where I've been going through changes and have seen a hawk. Once in college, looking at each other with a crowd of people stopping around us. Then it took off and I heard several people say ""wow that was weird"" ""is that your pet?"" ""looks like you made a friend"". Another time I was going through some intense changes in my life, feeling like I had really lost touch with myself. I was in the car with my family on Christmas day going to see my Aunt and a hawk slammed into our windshield and skidded off into oncoming traffic, dying instantly as a van ran over it. My family was startled but kind of joked about it saying ""well that sure was a Christmas miracle"" or calling it ""the Christmas hawk of death"". I felt really intense about it, like I had to remember that event because it was meaningful and as if I needed to say some sort of blessing for the hawk and I felt like it really was a reminder that I needed to do better.

So back to recently, meditating, cutting out bad habits, almost every other day I see a hawk flying directly above me, often during times that I'm trying to decide what I need to do next. Accompanying this sort of new mystic feeling and symbolism is that I keep having psychic dreams. I dream of seeing people I've never met, then meeting them days later, going places and experiencing things that are quite unique and then days later having those experiences. I experience dejavu so often that it's almost expected. A few weeks ago I decided one day to go to a thrift store and find some new pants. I was looking through some of the random decorative knickknacks and found this. I brought it to the counter and the man ringing me up looked me up and down and smiled really big saying ""I've really been wanting someone like you to buy this, I think it's made from rooster and hawk feathers"". I looked up hawk feathers but I wasn't sure by googling it whether that's actually what it's made from. On the back is a label explaining that it's handmade by a native american in Texas.

I know these experiences are there as a reminder for me to do better, I decided to actually google ""hawk spirit animal"" and the results were so on point, so exactly what I thought it was. Reading through the description of what a ""hawk person's"" downfalls can be, strengths are, potentials are... I've never felt such a syncronistic, frisson inducing, absolutely true experience. I know that a lot of these kinds of things can be a bit like a fortune cookie, but this is so beyond that. I already knew the meaning of the hawk, this is just an attempt to make this easily digestible for an audience. There are so many strange beyond coincidental things that keep happening to me

I'd just started exploring the occult again after a hiatus of several years. It was the fall of my senior year in college, Gems from the Equinox, The Book of Pleasure.... lots of ""forbidden knowledge"". I'd begun making sigils, basic sorts of things, messing around with visualization, when I got some news that kind of threw me out of whack.

I had a friend-enemy of some years we can just call ""Steve"". I'm sure we all know people like him: smarmy, generally kind of an asshole. He was kind of like Austin Powers except that he was always shagging the girls you were interested in or (as did happen once in high school and again a year before this story) dating at the time.

While I'm over it now (it's been ages)- in large part because of the events I'm describing- I hated Steve. I hated him with a burning passion for fucking me over more times than I was comfortable thinking about. Hating him was a way of displacing my anger with myself. And now,"" I told him, ""It'll be fun.""

I started picturing ways to destroy him. I was into drugs at the time, there was something in Steve's tone when he called that seemed, if not repentent, somehow innocent. Do you get mad at a scorpion for stinging you, or do you just accept its a scorpion and move on?

Anyway, the way he'd screwed with my life... and then... oh jeez... Then I grabbed for my copy of the Necronomicon by Simon.

I don't know what the consensus about this book is around here. Personally, etc.) but don't put much faith in the idea that the Old Ones existed before the stories were written and Lovecraft channeled his work through them in dreams. I think that's one way of looking at it. Anyway.

I found the sigil for Cthulhu. I drew it on my wrist. I pledged myself to evil

Ok, got dinner, and in essence I felt myself wanting to let my anger go. I just don't talk to Steve anymore- why keep people in your life who don't have your best interest at heart right? The night ended with the two of us having a drunken cigarette on a bench before he headed to his hotel, and I went to go meet a friend- probably to buy some pills or something. **This is when things got weird:** 

I remember arriving at my friend's house. Then I blacked out. When I came to my friend was screaming at me, but I wasn't hurt. **I had torn a half dollar sized chunk out of his neck with my fucking teeth**- for no reason and without any provocation.

Ok. I was drunk

I worked myself into a rage, pledged myself to doing ill, and when I tried to back out of the ""contract"", I went through with it anyway. Or something in my body went through with it for me... It's all very confusing.

What's weirder about this- if anyone has read H.P. Lovecraft's work- is that this is almost the ending of the ""Rats in the Walls"". The narrator blacks out in the cavernous passage beneath his house after faced with the evidence his ancestors were cannibals. Then, with my own cat leaping and tearing at my throat.""

**Anyway** this was a really weird turn of events. You try explaining to someone you've just attacked that you're sorry, dark archetypal possibly egregoric things-that-should-not-be. In the end we managed to patch things up, both our friendship and his neck, and this became a weird footnote to my college career. That moment though was when the occult became real for me. Scary real. I haven't messed with the Necronomicon since, and I don't do negative work anymore. You should be trying to have fun, not giving yourself over entirely to your pain-hatred-etc.

Transpersonal forces: Entities (however you define them) native to the transpersonal realm (i.e. the spirit world, or both at the same time. Take your pick. That's just how they roll.

Information: Relatively objective pieces of data

Meaning: More subjective pieces of data, intuitions and personal interpretations of information. In fact, most meaning boils down to subjective interpretations of information.

Insertion: Any change in a person's mental processes induced by transpersonal forces that adds information or meaning to these processes

Ego: What most people see as 'themselves', transpersonal forces, and more. It is not really an oversimplification to say that all spiritual growth has transcendence of ego as its main purpose.

---

Transpersonal forces communicate information and meaning to humans much more commonly than a lot of people would be comfortable knowing. Ignorance is bliss, especially for those to whom the idea of surrendering the ego is not a frightening prospect.

---

The most common way this is done is by inserting something into the local feedback loop (the person's sequence of thoughts, etc.) to convey meaning. This is far less intrusive and takes less effort than inserting more external communications to convey information, hence its popularity even for people who are very much locked up in their egos.

A simple example of this process: You think some thought -&gt; inserted intuition produces an amplified 'yes' feeling to that thought -&gt; you feel that your thought is (i.e. has the meaning of) correct and valid. Thus

Another example is synchronicities, and intuition provides the meaning of that information.

This process is of course more transparent to a person in the dream state

---

When it comes to direct insertion of information, and usually reserved for those of little ego. Meaning is floating everywhere in a person's psyche, but most people are used to receiving infomation only from easily identifiable physical sources.

There are also varying degrees of intrusion involved in the different methods available for inserting information. For example, there are other reasons why automatic writing has advantages over thought projection (for example, it is more focused and less open to interference from the person's own thoughts), but less intrusion is definitely a big factor.

---

Here we come to a general, especially from the transpersonal, which most people's egos are just not used to interacting with directly. This resistance drains the person of energy and can be dangerous to his or her mental health, and hence influence by transpersonal forces is always tailored to the person's convenience. This is of course simplifying things, as there are many other factors to be considered here - but then again, not much can be said about these kinds of things without simplification.

Back again to the automatic writing example. A typical recipient is much more used to impulsive tendencies for movement (e. g. as a spontaneous reaction to an external threat) than to hearing thoughts inside his or her head that are definitely not his or her own

And of course, these just blend in smoothly with all the other subconscious activity that goes on in people's mental lives.

---

Also, but these days this has to a great extent been relegated (at least when it comes to mainstream culture) to psychological pathology, or highly formal religious events such as the ones orchestrated by preachers in the style of Benny Hinn, who serve as mediators and moralizers on behalf of the transpersonal. We are definitely in a very ego-centered phase, and scientific materialism (where the existence of anything transpersonal is flatly denied) and religious fundamentalism (where the ego is seen as being in a mostly subservient relationship with the transpersonal realm, and real spiritual growth is often sadly lacking) are the two main ideologies by which the ego is inflated and maintained, and they even influence and prop each other up in many subtle ways.

---

Of course, and more frequent reception. The person will develop a better and better intuition, experience more and more synchronicities, and even enter the highly overt levels of channeling and other forms of direct communications with transpersonal forces. Do bear in mind, though, that you are never yourself in control of this process. Receive everything you are given with gratitude, and know that while you have earned it by letting go of ego it is still a privilege, everyone does of course have a very personal and individual relationship with the transpersonal, insertions of overt information are much less common than insertions of subjective meaning.

---

This is why overt psychic phenonema are so resistant to objective proof; this resistance is built into them in order to keep the focus on the natural and gradual development of the individual in the physical world. Psychic powers should always be seen as first and foremost as a tool for aiding this development, a transpersonal force would much more commonly prod you into obtaining a good, informative book than tell you what's in it directly. Anyway, it's much more healthy, both physically and mentally, to go out and do stuff once in a while than to hang around all day chatting with unseen friends, fun as that might be!

---

A somewhat lesser but still pertinent reason why these phenomena are resistant to objective proof is to keep them out of the hands, there are documented cases of government agencies attempting to prod into them in order to see if they can be used as weapons of control and warfare, as such agencies are wont to do. The simplest way to prevent this sort of tomfoolery is to not give these less than well intentioned individuals and institutions anything concrete to work with. It all works out quite beautifully most of the time, so do not be frustrated by your lack of ability to 'prove' that psychic phenomena are real. This is as it is meant to be, for the protection of those who are gifted with these abilities. And back again to the spiritual aspect, learning to use these abilities without feeling the need to stroke the ego by parading them around is a good lesson in humility.

A few years ago I came to the idea that ""reality"" in fact, the ""true"" way things exist for him, are different for that of every other person that has sight. Now, the mass naturally assumes that the other person is broken and therefore misses out on a part of what is ""real"". However, just because it doesn't conform doesn't mean that the view of the blind man is any less ""real"" to him than normal vision is to everyone else. For that man, a world of emptiness is his truth, his reality. Based on this thought, or your neighbor

Insanity: A deranged state of mind usually occurring as a specific disorder.

Based on the conjecture that reality doesn't exist on a global level and is in fact personal, instead you have simply the thoughts of the individual person. In essence: whatever you see is your own reality.

Now, a disassociation with reality based on experience or biology. However, with no reality to disassociate from, because it's entirely subjective, who's to say that you're not instead achieving the pinnacle of control over your world?

The final culmination of this idea is as follows: by achieving, ""Becoming a living God"". Once you can change the way all of your tactile senses register information to allow for these creations of your consciousness, your thought forms allow you to literally control EVERYTHING. Every way you feel, every way you see, every person you want around you, anything you want is suddenly yours to behold. In this case, because reality is subjective, rather than living in one that the mass of society chooses to incorporate themselves with?

I consider myself an unorthodox Mormon. I am not a church-attending one and don't feel very comfortable with a lot of the cultural aspects particularly.
I've always been intrigued by the faith's connection to mysticism and folk magic.  If one is going to read a book on the subject
Here are some tidbits that come mostly from Quinn:
There is evidence that Joseph Smith may have attempted to summon higher powers.  There is solid evidence he and his family were into astrology
Dreams and visions were an incredibly important part of the faith. Many mormons still believe in them but generally won't discuss them.  The church always encourages meditation but calls it ""pondering.""  Mormons worship one God but revere 3 other deities. Their cosmology also hints that there may be other gods out there. 
Not Smith but another church leader spoke of what most people would call astral projection.  He said sleep is a time to speak with our kindred dead and angels. After Joseph Smith was killed there were disputes about who would lead the organization. At one meeting Brigham Young spoke and took on the voice and appearance of Joseph Smith.

A a wiley by way of Siberia, a music maker of space-time paradigm, has decided to stop by, to contribute some knowledge and help put your old ways in the storage.


Small body big soul

Where do I get the energy

to expand


To become all 

I thought was impossible

At first

Quite plausible

do I run


justice for all


""it's impossible"" and ""No"" - says the little soul

Quite often cutting an opportunity off

If one might listen

Be I blessed or cursed by what my soul's worth

For everything is quite fair in this world


Life is a divine flow 

and God knows

Feeling in my chest drives me forth

Where do I get that energy?

To expand

Raise my consciousness?

Let my essence forward

Access the hidden

To be aware at all?


The way is one cause

The truth is the way

We are beautiful when we don't notice faults of 
others

Communication is true

Spec in your eye is a log in my soul

Will not let my consciousness rise at all.

What I plant in my mind


Some have crossed

Those who have crossed suffer to enlight

For suffering is step one


I am what I see

I see what I am

What do I spend my energy on

moment to moment

What do I notice

If I'm critical of empty talk and little knowledge

is it not the same side of the coin?

Fighting fire with fire when I'm hurt myself

They trigger it in me and I'm outraged


In reality it's been in me all along

I just faked my way through to pretend that I'm normal


There's pure light

I felt this way before

top of the world, 

overspilling with the way

Things appearing before my eyes once I think of them

Coincidences and synchronicity

That are random

Things happen willingly

Conscious or not

The higher to the eye of the pyramid

The better I connect with creativity

Relay natural flow

Love by design



The enemy turned into teachers

and hurt souls

tireless love to learn

At least to be hurt no more

(Though the least is what's common

People faulting other's fault

Talking with ego out of control

But honestly I don't know

If I should be talking about this at all


Kindness is the greatest quality soul can learn

Uncover what you already know but might have forgot

Jesus would forgive all

Forgiveness is the energy source 

Different words all meaning one

Ego knows no boundaries

It's bound to put water in your burning foundry

I see it every day

Love and hate

I didn't judge what I've seen

And I've seen enough to know that very little I've known is real

Communication is insincere when we live in fear it seems

Or need of control, a water-less sea?


We attract what we see

We get what we perceive

300 billion percent of what happens is how you feel


When someone is angry at you

It's nothing you haven't done to someone before

Karmic cycle

Time is not linear even for those karma free

Good deeds

You get lower the higher your pedestal  


If someone hurts you

It's nothing you haven't done exactly to someone before

So forgive and let go

Take it all with love cuz that's all there was

But if we choose to hurt another

It's going to happen to you once more

We can talk a lot about whats' right or wrong


Opinions are subjective

Truth is one

If you walked in a room a saw yourself standing

Or a stranger?

Polite and fake?

Afraid of non existant dangers?

Or truthful

Straight forward

and much truth to find

Fear has got you paralyzed

Conversations just die

Thinking the more you say the less cons and more pros

I haven't seen more deluded folks at all


Now that lesson is learned

Crystal clear soul will have God's love

After suffering

First step is to forgive all

Second step is to see everyone as your little bro

You wouldn't hurt a puppy cuz it peed on a carpet

Rise up to break your fall

You painted your ceiling but you had no floor

And you still wonder why we lurk in the lows?


Addictions

A masked parade


How we treat ourselves is how others treat us

You've gone too far and you need a revision

You've foolish with Nature's Law

Suffering it's time to learn


How we treat others before is how others treat us now

How we treat others now is how we will be treated later

Not same situations but same feelings will arise

The more you fight it the more it's fatal

Some say karma is like stars

They are near, vast and far

if I drop a coin

As above so below

A hurtful word is just a few steps away to the one who said it and started the whole mess

In the first place

A righteous man avoids a hurtful word

But not to let it eat your soul

Follow your intuition

Would you want to be treated the same way at all

If so


The problem is you are not sensitive enough to the energy you give off

A well versed word can be masked a pillow but in fact stone cold

I love can be said in hate

And from this love you wanna run away


So before I hear you complain

Drop your head

Every situation - give love

Understand

With your karmic intent

We swear we are in control but we are 95% reactive

Remember

Every situation - **give love**

Love in the face of hate

If it's hard to love, forgive and send prayers, today! (only 9.95 s&amp;h)

Turn your mind off and not fill it with much thinking at all

Queen of karma will then bless you

You see muse when the ceiling is lifted

And we still wonder why strange people are gifted?


Sometimes love means walking away

Suffering is understanding

Everything is relative

stuck in their ways

Patience...

The word love has a lot of connotations

But so does every word

Truly wise don't need to say anything

Aside from a explaining a few paradigmes and reacting ever so kind

We can change the world by changing our consciousness

On a forever quest
To the frequency we are on...
Hell and heaven represent the frequency spectrum
Where do we belong?


Don't know what else to say on the subject but I will try

I am glad you read through step one

Forgiveness and love to gain peace

And to keep your mind


Next time we will talk about other steps

To attempt to reach enlightenment

To counter balance societal attempt

To keep everyone in line and in check


Do they not see that they feel bad?

There are a few more steps

To attempt to understand where the truth stands

And where to get the energy

counter balance ignorance with knowledge

What do they know that I don't?

Found this reddit just now. You really can find everything on this website. Hope to find some interesting discussion and sources from here in the future. 

Thought I would open discussion regarding one of the fundamental questions of occultism: Why do we do it? What bought you here? What are we really seeking from the study and practice of it? Are you more interested purely in inner peace, evocation and the like?

To shine a light on this from my perspective, feeling one with the Universe, the whole shebang. From that point forward my life changed, and to try and understand what happened to me I jumped into the occult literature. Have probably tried or am familiar with most of what's out there.

Now my problem is that it's always been a process of jumping into it, I ask myself questions like: What am I really learning from this? Can I really learn more about myself from learning about some hidden correspondence of a Tarot card than I can from engaging in the world around me? Social life, romance, exercising, advancing your career, aren't these all the real ways in which we find out what we are really made of and attain self-knowledge?

And yet.. I always come back to it. I probably always will if once we are called, the occult is the best place to turn. I hope to come closer to the realisation and knowledge of that True Self within us that drives us. Even if I constantly question myself whether I really make progress or not.

1320899249.0,m71a2,Confronting my inner skepticism,the_bewildered_beast,20,0,26,"Hi all - 
I'm a new entrant into the world of the occult. I've been into various mystical elements for many years
That being said, they coincide with my belief in paranormal powers which are backed up by scientific experiment, and in my opinion, Western mysticism is a little more life affirming than Eastern mysticism.
The universe that the occult posits has a lot going for it beyond just you and 'God' as well. I've recently come to believe in ghosts, supernatural phenomenon, and they often talk of beings that exist that are purely supernatural in essence, yet are separate from God. That also makes sense to me, if God is to create countless conscious beings that inhabit the material realm, and you believe in a supernatural realm, why should there not be supernatural beings separate from God?

But here's where there begins to be a problem.
Some of the ways in which the occult suggests that you interact with these supernatural forces, and in the program, they followed people practicing Chaos Magick around. During the time that they merely conversed about it, I felt on board.  Then came the ceremony...and I thought they looked like a bunch of LARPers. A man in a cheaply done pair of wings painted himself red while a bunch of people in robes enthusiastically chanted ""BAPHOMET! BAPHOMET!"" while throwing their arms in his direction. If there actually exists any notion of the creature of Baphomet external to this particular individuals mind alone, no doubt he would have smited them for making a mockery of him. 
I've been on forums that non-chalantly talk about summoning a succubus for sexual purposes, as if this is actually happening, as if it's common knowledge that you repeat a few words while burning the right type of incense and wearing the right color robe and a sexy demon will appear that you can bang to your hearts content. 
To me, and *consciously* fulfill the experiment. In order for development to occur, failure has to be a possibility. That is the notion of anything remotely resembling a scientific doctrine, and the occult often represents itself this way, even the quote on the sidebar of the subreddit reads:
""A place where more than likely most of those who gather believe faith is the death of intelligence."" What are these examples if not  overwhelming faith and wishful thinking?
Which leads me to my last gripe. Even the Golden Dawn ritual book, has items that seem silly and totally arbitrary to me. Why should my dagger be yellow? Why does myrrh bring me contact with the divine? These things seem totally irrelevant to me in the development of spiritual enlightenment. Eastern mysticisism's tactics seem totally relevant to its stated goals - ceasing thought allows one to experience an inner peace that is the true nature of existence, and by quieting ones thoughts, you're able to tune out the chatter of your own subjectivity. Even yogic practices of ultimate physical concentration can bring about an inner peace.  These practices even yield scientifically quantifiable results to atheists who share none of the metaphysical beliefs of the practitioners. To me, that is a hallmark of a valid practice. 
I feel that there is very real substance to the occult, precognition etc are things largely ignored by Eastern mysticism, that find a home in the occult. Yet I also feel that many occult practioners live in a land of pure make believe, where because I am imaging myself at this moment, descending into hell and slaying demons, have just had a valid experience, an experience as valid as one who has studied for years, but that this imagination led to real experience, not that you have to devote yourself to developing your imagination and will
If you've made it this far, or distanced themselves from those elements in occultism they find silly, or perhaps can tell me where I went wrong, or all three. If you disagree with me entirely, lovely, but please give some substantive reasons, anything at all that can help me think. I hope you understand that I am not writing this to offend, and I very much do.

As an occultist, so I'm not critiquing his value judgments, just the structure of his model of reality as having a basis in the actual.) It seems that many occultists hold the view that there IS no actual reality, only (at most) personal realities that intersect between people. His model gives us convenient language by which to describe the difference between an assumed ""unmodified"" reality and our experienced modified ones, but it may not be accurate, even from a psychological perspective (what would we compare observed realities to in order to see if they were modified?).

I guess providing some hints is the best we can do.

Another reason I write this is that people who read /r/occult should realize that all the helpful stuff they read here is only a collection of hints and lots, and it's not always due to stinginess or hoarding of knowledge.  So if you want to know more, you have to ask more.  Every time you ask, you get another hint.

Sup

So

It reminds me of a lot of pre-christian creation myth where the chaos/formless ocean proceeds the physical world as we know it. An example is the slaying of Tiamat and her body being divided up to form a stable creation for the New Gods and mortals to inhabit. 

I find this interesting because this theory parallels many creation myths over the world sans poetic anthropocentric imagery. Personally I feel that if this new theory is true then there is a very high likelihood that this chaoskampf motif may be the result of self-similar patterns in the universe. Specifically that the development of consciousness from conception to maturity parallels the solidification and expansion of space-time


This leads me to asking how you thought all this shit got started and how and if it has any baring on our practices. Being  /r/occult there should be some interesting theories at least.

I said something like ""It's very interesting/nice to meet you Crowley""
I also don't remember the faces/appearances of any of the other people in that room.

&gt;We talked about something briefly and then I was presented with two chalices in front of me
I asked ""Whose blood is this?"" and they answered ""You know who"".
Then I was instructed to take both chalices

&gt;I then began drinking but I messed up and a lot of the blood was spilled on myself and on the floor. 
Aleister said something
After this I suddenly woke up and I had a feeling that I've never had before
I finished drinking from the chalices

&gt;After the dance was finished
On the ground there was a silver (? not completely sure) mirror of some kind and I was given a crystal wand in my hand.
I was told to try and spin it clockwise above the mirror as it will prove to be impossible to do
After a while of spinning it perfectly clockwise
I also remember the crystal feeling extremely hot just prior to it shattering.

&gt;Now once again

After all this I woke up

Once the fear started to approach I felt the panic start to creep up on me.  I was laying there while a dark figure slowly walked towards me. Once the figure made it to the door to my room I wanted to do nothing but open my eyes. Instead I just let him creep closer and closer. Each step filled me with paralyzing fear. I knew the figure didn't exist but that this is what my mind was creating. It didn't help dull the terror though.

Once the ""thing"" got close enough to touch me

I stared at it and it stared back. I didn't really ask it but more of sent a feeling of curiosity towards it if that makes sense. In response the thing slowly moved its face towards mine until it was a hairs length away. it was at this point that I was pretty much shitting myself with newly developed fear. Then

To understand the effects that i felt when I woke up you have to understand me. I have suffered with depression my entire life. Just recently the love of my life (Or so I thought) abandoned me. My only two friends in the world left to travel 5000 miles away from me. One for Alaska and one for Afghanistan. I lost my job due to the fact that they could no longer afford me. Shit has been pretty low.

Every time I thought of doing something (Writing, cleaning) I have been overcome with the sense of ""Why bother"". It has put me in a very deep and dark place in my life. But when I woke up... I felt new. I mowed my grass after a month of not caring, I wrote at least twenty pages of my book, I applied online to a couple places, and I got a text message from my ex lover. That text message I am still pondering over whether or not I should respond and what to decide if we start talking again. I even plan to go out meeting a couple people for a job today.

But all in all this was a great experience. I didn't so much explore the confines of my mind but I seemed to have unlocked something. I hope you guys have found this as interesting as I have. I am definitely glad I went through with this experience. Hope I didn't bore you guys to bad.

I just joined the forum after coming quite accidently upon the topic, by the very definition of secret, I highly doubt that he would have expressed this publicly.

1369563433.0,1f2qvb,"What is your opinion of modern science and scientific method, and maybe more importantly, the direction science has taken?",Aleid,22,9

I believe the scientific method (as i understand it to be - its merely following rational, or rather a model which predicts the truth accurately (which leads me on a little tangent regarding fanatic science fan-boys who are ever-prevalent these days touting science as 'hard fact' without any understanding of the concept of a model which i believe is nicely explained in Alfred Korzybski statement of ""The MAP is NOT the TERRITORY"").

As to the weaknesses off this method, which achieves a higher predictability power due to the larger amounts of vectors - represented in various symbolic forms - to perform operations on)

However I believe many today deny themselves the experience of viewing their knowledge set through the lens of 5th circuit consciousness from which emerges holistic thinking which transcends many of the false dualities of the lower circuits and allows the mind the ability to dissect and tinker with formative ideas (which later become material ideas in the lower circuits represented via various forms of symbolism) in new ways that leads to true innovation in scientific thought.

Translation of these 5th circuit ideas into the 3rd circuit - which is concerned with practicality, which is ultimately useful to humanity as a whole (in regards to manipulating the physical world - on a tangent, which correlates with my thoughts that demiurgic powers are one of the ultimate innate desires of mankind).

So these 3rd circuit models are really maps for territories that exist in the 5th circuit (which you could say are maps for territories of higher circuits. each circuit as you go up the chain is kind of a mirror reflecting on one or more of the previous circuits allowing for a more objective look at the data relations between and within them via various feedback loops - which leads to the evolution of these higher circuits of consciousness). 

As mentioned earlier

An example of evolution of symbolism and the power over natural systems more complex symbolism allows is that of the evolution of alchemists into modern chemists. The symbols of the alchemists where parts of a 3rd circuit map they where trying to create of the formative territory - which both classic alchemy and modern sciences are derived from - of the 5th circuit that they could envision by using those parts of consciousness. 

The problem the early alchemists had - compared to the later chemists - was the lack of symbolism that could explain formative ideas in symbolism that was cross-cultural and more recently

This symbolism would soon grow from itself

As insane as explanations of the workings and understandings of the symbolism of early esoteric/philosophical schools may seem to modern scientists

The difficulty in communication between the two is because - as stated earlier - many modern scientists are heavily imprinted into the 3rd circuit, therein lies the difficulty of the translation.

The ancient/archaic philosophical/esoteric arts/sciences where often more heavily influenced by the 5th circuit and often thought in more formative terms which they translated into symbols representing the large datasets they could explain in one thought-form. 

Comparing this to the modern scientist who see's through the 3rd circuit: due to the enormous depth and complexity our modern symbolism has evolved into today (via the neural feedback loops) we have made it incredibly more difficult to view things through the 5th circuit lens as we are so caught up  wading through the ridiculous amount of seemingly never ending symbolism and interconnections of symbolism (a.k.a. Neuro-Linguistic-Prison) that people often spend their whole life living without ever thinking in a formative context of 5th circuit consciousness

As a result in this shift of balance between the level of attainment of true clarity   - those trapped in the never ending symbolism of the 3rd circuit

Instead of true innovation being sought through higher thinking

Symbolic models fight through an order so obtuse, that capitalizes on itself to further its desires while destroying the true formative Self of humanity and reality and further reinforcing it's own 'illusory' self.

Here are some of the issues I'm struggling with:

* Different versions of the tree of life and its arrangement
* Different systems of attributions between the tree of life and various contexts. Some people use it as a map of consciousness in general, and many other perspectives. They seem to contradict each other and none of them has been stated clearly enough to be of much use to me so far.

* Different attributions for the tarot cards and of their arrangement on the tree of life. The most common system is the 22 trumps for the 22 paths on the tree of life

* How are the cards actually used to traverse the tree?

I know the tree can be interpreted in many ways

The best I've come up with so far is the following perspective: The tree of life can be used as a map of spiritual ""locations"" or states of consciousness. Everyone starts at the bottom and you gradually unlock other sephiroth by traversing the pathways (like a skill tree in a videogame).

My theory or idea is that the majority of us dont actually live in the present

Imagine if you will

future projection is when your anticipating a future event, because you are not moving.

This phenomenon of past and future projection can speed up or slow down time. If everyone has their minds projected in the future, this can slow down the present and impede on the progress of mankind. an example of this is fundamentalist christians not wanting to progess further into science or social matters. These fundamentalists are slowing down time because they are clinging to the 1950's by projecting themselves onto the past, and people like us who project into the future are dragging everyone else along with us.

Then the imagination is a whole different story. if past and future projection is like left or right, or up and down. By thinking of alternative worlds, we steer the direction of the present into alternate universes.

really to me, but all together never fully on the present itself. By the time your mind processes what time it is, its already behind because you have to wait for signals to process.

what ive noticed with psychedelics is that they allow your mind to safely project onto the past or the future without feeling the pull of the present in the past, or past or future, just different locales in hyper space.

I hope this is a suitable subreddit, religions, circles, or practices... but this week I've been lurking in Occult and I like what you all have going here! :)

However
     

Here it goes! :)        
  

This is a personal post
    

I am usually very rigid and objective, the normal, and the sensible reality I'm stuck in. I've been riding this varied wave of spirituality, occult, philosophical, and religious ideologies/theories for about a year now.        
  

Most of my life has been a dull, as if for a moment, hour, or day.. escaping the mundane, dark, and dull that I so often find myself in.        
  

 Every once in a while, or gradual and long (week/month) that allows me to really LOOK. It allows me to see the world around me with open eyes and notice patterns, synchronization, and coincidences that seem to apply DIRECTLY to me. It's as if it's a dream and no one else can see it. This dream state allows me to suspend my usual disbelief and just ""go with the flow"" and watch the surprises unfold.        
  

The feeling is undeniably warm
  

I cherish these moments, you know it's for you, but the message is in another language. At the end, I'm not even sure of they certainly are for me, or if my brain is just making connections?    

This explains what I am experiencing

Now the bigger synchronicity: while reading Prometheus Rising

http://i.imgur.com/a7T1w.png

I paused on seeing this for a few moments of dumbstruck awe. The female figure looked almost identical to one in a drawing I'd done nine years earlier:

http://i.imgur.com/knjEP.gif

Here are the two images side by side:

http://i.imgur.com/oa3eG.png

To put this all in context:

At the time of the drawing I was in a pretty good place spiritually. I'd had a run of some divinely blissful mushroom experiences

After that I kind of drifted off the path into a more mundane existence... until a couple of years ago when I got into a pretty bad place and wound up shooting back onto the spiritual path big time

At the time of writing I'm at a crossroads where I know my life is going to change a lot in a year or two (completing a degree)

As for the synchronicity:

I'm not familiar with Tarot, union of the lower instinctual self and higher spiritual self, etc. 

So the meaning of Lust seems to connect to both the spiritual peak I was experiencing at the time of the drawing

Comparing the two pictures,"" without solid grounding. This again seems reflective of my current predicament, as achieving this grounding is what I'm trying to do.

The synchronicities are impressive (to me at least)

I'm really curious what this community thinks of all this. Am I missing anything in interpreting the Lust card? Am I overlooking some potentially meaningful connection?

**EDIT:** Thanks everyone for your input

**EDIT:** Still fermenting things. But a minor deluge of new synchronicities have popped up today, what I'm taking away from it all for now, based on the initial synchronicity, your comments, and the newer stuff, is the following. (1) Indulge more frequently and more deeply in the pleasures of everyday life and meditative concentration states (perhaps I have had an overly renunciative attitude lately). (2) Everyday living requires action and 'going somewhere'; one can take either a barren urban path or a pleasant nature path to get to the same destination, i.e. the beauty of nature is an aspect of the path, the 'doing' of everyday life need not be inconsistent with the 'being' of the spiritual life.

With that in mind, as briefly as possible, to summarize their style and beliefs. Hopefully some replies in this thread can talk about other teachers.

The first man that I started reading was Israel Regardie. He is a  very scholarly man, is Hermeticism - he's a Golden Dawn man. His approach can be very mechanistic, at odds with those who are more Chaos influenced. But since he is so scholarly, I think his perspective on rituals almost becomes historical. That is to say, most teachers try to engage your subconscious in some fashion, Chaos magicians try to do that by self expression that bypasses conscious thought, while I feel Israel Regardie learns so much of various traditions, you immerse yourself in their 'culture' throught learning and development of the imagination, please do so.

Next up, practice, practice. I like his style very much, he builds up with exercises that develop your imagination and will in a variety of ways. For instance, he might have you hold an image in your mind for 5 minutes. Then, after you have completed that, create a 'video' in your mind that includes sound. Then, see from its perspective, it is more about developing your faculties. He also seems fairly influenced from Eastern thought. It's as if he took Eastern methodology in Western context.

For simplicity sake, so with most levels being around half an inch to an inch, seeing two inches was surprising and hard to miss.  Most often the aura is composed of one dominant colour, which will change based on mood, and either a black or a white tinge to it.  Black is bad regardless of the dominant colour (and a side note, I've never seen grey..the black and white never seem to mix like the colours can) and white is good.  This particular aura was unlike the rest in that instead of there being one dominant colour and a tinge, there were two distinct bands of blue and green within the aura.  I later came to realize this meant she was pregnant.

I do not know what the colours mean

Now for seeing them.  Forget trying to see the auras of people for now.  They are too small and people move too much to learn to differentiate between the 'after-image' effect and a true aura at the beginning.  For now I'll give one way for those who want to learn, so it's just a rough approximation.  In any case it helps you to visualize the line that surrounds the body to be examined.

This is the true way to increase your energy...the appreciation of the plant.  I can only tell so much and there is so much to cover in order to truly allow the energy to enter you, but for now, simple appreciation at dawn or dusk should form a line about 5-6 inches above the tree line and it should almost perfectly follow the tree line.  This is the aura of the forest and your first step to tripping people out!  Learn to get used to hearing 'How do you do this?!' and responding graciously.

**Fascinated by his own imagination, religion and his relationship with Wordsworth, this book builds to a new interpretation of the poems where Coleridge's daemonic imagination produces its myths: ""The Rime of the Ancient Mariner,"" ""Kubla Khan"" and ""Christabel."" Gregory Leadbetter reveals a Coleridge at once more familiar and more strange, in a study that unfolds into an essay on poetry, spirituality, and the drama of human becoming.**


Part IV of the poem

`I fear thee

I fear thy skinny hand!

And thou art long,

As is the ribbed sea-sand.


I fear thee and thy glittering eye

And thy skinny hand

""Fear not

This body dropped not down.

Alone, all alone,

Alone on a wide wide sea!

And never a saint took pity on

My soul in agony.

The many men

And they all dead did lie;

And a thousand thousand slimy things

Lived on; and so did I.

I looked upon the rotting sea

And drew my eyes away;

I looked upon the rotting deck

And there the dead men lay.

I looked to heaven

But or ever a prayer had gusht

A wicked whisper came and made

My heart as dry as dust.

I closed my lids

And the balls like pulses beat;

Forthe sky and the sea

Lay like a load on my weary eye

And the dead were at my feet.

The cold sweat melted from their limbs

Nor rot nor reek did they:

The look with which they looked on me

Had never passed away.

An orphan's curse would drag to hell

A spirit from on high;

But oh! more horrible than that

Is the curse in a dead man's eye!

Seven days,

And yet I could not die.

The moving moon went up the sky

And no where did abide:

Softly she was going up

And a star or two beside - 

Her beams bemocked the sultry main

Like April hoar-frost spread;

But where the ship's huge shadow lay

The charmed water burnt alway

A still and awful red.

Beyond the shadow of the ship

I watched the water-snakes:

They moved in tracks of shining white

And when they reared

Fell off in hoary flakes.

Within the shadow of the ship

I watched their rich attire:

Blue,

They coiled and swam; and every track

Was a flash of golden fire.

O happy living things! no tongue

Their beauty might declare:

A spring of love gushed from my heart

And I blessed them unaware:

Sure my kind saint took pity on me

And I blessed them unaware.

The selfsame moment I could pray;

And from my neck so free

The Albatross fell off

Like lead into the sea.""

If I can bring your attention to the concept of flow [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)]  (some call it being in the zone, etc):

&gt; Nakamura and Csíkszentmihályi identify the following six factors as encompassing an experience of flow.


&gt; 1. intense and focused concentration on the present moment
&gt; 2. merging of action and awareness
&gt; 3. a loss of reflective self-consciousness
&gt; 4. a sense of personal control or agency over the situation or activity
&gt; 5. a distortion of temporal experience
&gt; 6. experience of the activity as intrinsically rewarding


&gt;Those aspects can appear independently of each other

This state seem to often occur when performing tasks that we are highly skilled and that pose a high level of challenge. Refer to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Challenge_vs_skill.svg 

This seems like a fairly intuitive idea to me and it is something I have been experimenting with for a while now through the targeted development of skills in a variety of areas. Personally, musical instruments, cooking, etc).

At a surface level, given the right frame of mind, it can be self-induced on tasks that it usually would not occur on (like sweeping the floor or washing the dishes). This really allows for a greatly heightened ability to focus on just about any task, problem or idea. Over time it becomes possible to enter into a state of deep insight on an increasingly broader scope of activities. Conceptually, it seems comparable with meditative experience.

---

A small but important point I think: I am coming to the conclusion that sorcery and shamanism are related but quite distinct. I was actually talking with a researcher who did a simple brainwave study on alleged evil sorcerers vs. healing shamans. He found that

Sorcery is not ""evil, i.e., planeswalking. A lot of psychonautics is sorcery. Shamanism shares principles, worldviews, and legends with sorcery, but it is primarily about healing and ""white magic"" (think Buddhist peace-mundanity-meditation vs. Christian death-worship identity self-combustion).

Sorcery comes to us in ""tales of power

Deleuze is a great place to start for more on this perspective of sorcery.

1368989555.0,1en7ee,A short treatise to reconcile differences between decks,clow_reed,18,3,5,"[The reader]

My first comment is about the reader. Some readers (diviners) will read the emotional means of the cards

The other type of reader is to remember what the descriptions are, no less. They mainly try to remove the intuitive aspect for a scientific aspect that can be repeated.

Depending on what kind of reading I am doing, if for myself, I will use a deck I am less familiar with and I will do a straight ""whats the card say in the lil' white book?"". I have found that method does lessen my bias on my own readings about stuff in my life. However, I do prefer intuitive readings by far.

[The Cards]

The next area is the decks themselves. We have 4 main lineages of decks: RWS, and Historical decks (Visconti-Sforza, Marseilles). There are other decks that have carved their own niche, like Motherpeace or Book of Shadows Tarot (wicca learning deck).

The lineages are important

Thoth is one of those weird ones that Crowley worked with. The first noticeable alteration is the elemental attributions to Swords and Wands are flipped. This can cause immediate confusion. Secondly, along with astrological comparisons. However, to utilize his system, you need to study his base of beliefs. And it was also understood that many pitfalls and traps were placed here as well.

Osho Zen is one of those weird tarot~but not tarot decks. The book does match each appropriate card to the standard 78 tarot cards. However, as to get to the heart of a matter.

Lastly, Queen, knight, or page. You could take out the majors and the knight from the deck, and you have a nice set of playing cards. Nobody would think otherwise. Now, the majors are much more detailed, and given the ""witchcraft words"". However, we can alternatively see La Papessa

[The reconciliation]

So now, and 4 styles of decks. So, how do we reconcile between decks and their books that have fairly different divination meanings? My own answer is that you do not. For those that have intuitively worked with a few decks, know each deck has its own feeling; its own language. Dark Grimoire (Tarocchi del Necronomicon) has a radically different feel than the Transparent tarot. It is important to understand the lineage of the deck as to ascertain how they came up with the meanings and attributions.

If you use Transparent Tarot, use a book that follows that book. If you're experimenting with Osho's Zen deck, use that book. We can do this between decks, because a deck creator almost always keeps a deck balanced within itself. A deck creator however, cannot easily balance the symbolism between the other thousands of other decks.

Being frank

A better way to put it

Looking for a magic bullet. Feeling afraid. Finding the answer on /r/alcoholism has been a challenge because it's 12 steps. And it's 12 steps or you're not getting it. It's a box. Coming from a musical background where there's 12 tones

The appeal of the occult; sigils, summoning, the power of within...symbology. That makes sense to me. 

Finding myself between the dual powers of taping into a small world contained in a cylindrical bottle of elixer (booze) and the rest of the living

Here's a verbatim diary entry I wrote (for myself) while completely sober, lots of 'isms):

""Sobriety, and enter the space of another, far more exciting and healthy planet. To escape the gravitational pull of this dying krypton it requires force and energy...propulsion. While in transit there is turbulance and a fantastic resistance. This, one of many infinite, possible, solutions to the question of who am i, has its own gravitational forces. And similar to taking flight, to slip into the bottle and inhabit the reality i helped imagine into existence in the first place. Its the way it always has been and the way it will always be. The exciting thing is that proves that it is real. Just as soon as one temporal plane is departed

So when the force shock of blasting out of one reality, the initial anxiousness of flight, consume the unitiated, or the weary traveler -- its never because one chooses to direct their lives, thought, imagination, passion, love

Alan carr put it

I started drinking around 16 or 17 years old. Im now 35. More than half my life. Its understandable that there be an exhilarating rush as i blast off that plane and seek out another.

However, but the fullblown MDD 'can't feel emotions, no willpower, no focus, no energy, I'm always only 1/4 of my real self' style of depression. Serious shit.

**TLDR:**

I'm in a depressive state now that I've been in for three months at least. Last year I was in the same state, surprisingly. Last year, I felt myself exit the depression when I read a series of magic articles on chaosmatrix.org. Something about the magic of the articles seemed to pull me out of it.

About two weeks ago, filled with renewed power and energy, contentedness and possibility. (You're talking to someone who hasn't even experienced contentedness, let alone happiness, for the last three months before this.) Days, weeks later now, and it seems like I never actually came out of the depression really, along with a feeling of knowing surely I was out of it.

My exits from depression always involve magic, life challenges that challenge me to find new magical ways to overcome problems, etc) as do my big growths and changes in life. But this false/partial coming-out, though it seemed like it was going to bring me back into non-depression, just didn't do the job.

I've been interested in the occult for a long time, and even psychic potential always appealed to me, but I never really took any effort to 'study' it.

Found this sub-reddit however, and saw something that I found interesting.  Chaos Magic(k).  (I spell it without the K, dunno if that's appropriate or not here.)  I read the description of it and was kinda shocked.  The concepts/beliefs presented in that very much match how I feel about the world in general, the idea that, at the end of the day, it matters less what you do, but *why* you do it.  And you get to choose the why yourself.

Normally, a little too coincidental.  I know I'm just attracted to the idea that maybe others see the world the way that I do, a way that, in my experience, is outside the boundaries of what most people are taught.

Unfortunately, maybe someone can point me in the right direction?  I still don't know that I buy any of this, the idea of intuitive knowledge.  I'm definitely the type that likes empirical evidence, but I do like to think I'm open minded enough to at least take what's given to me at face value and decide for myself if it's worth pursuing or not.

I dunno about the idea of 'Practicing

And there are too many who are clearly intelligent for me to write them off as simply mad...  And a couple of bits I've read are simply...  Well, again, too coincidental.

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500 words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. We posted a few months ago our beta version and had a ton of great responses from the Reddit community. It would be fascinating to find some candidates from the Occult community and hear their perspectives. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our camper van will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. 

Throughout our journey, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, Reddit, pure chance

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.

I'm guessing most of you would have gone through what my boyfriend went through. Became curious about the topic as early as his teen years and dug out all the books that Sunday school warned against. He grew up in a SUPER conservative part of South Africa that some have fondly called ""back water."" His knowledge of traditional magics and writings is quite impressive. With the strong theoretical back ground he has he can achieve some awesome things.

My personal experience was without books and with intuition. Around the age of 11 I realised there was more to the world than the physical. Started playing with the concept of psychic phenomena. I got pretty good. Had a buddy I would practice with. Then high school happened, aura cleansing and spirit cards but encouraged curiosity. That was the first time I ever visited an occult store. Didn't have any guidance though so I bought a couple of random books. One still doesn't make sense to me (Sacred Geometry) and the other I could see the point of but pruned out so much frippery that what's left could be a pamphlet. (Some orange book about spirit summoning.) I didn't even have decent Internet access until I left for university so I couldn't look for resources online. Net result was that what I had learnt was purely from experimenting with philosophies and all self discovered. Down side is I battle to read any occult text without getting bored now. They read like Shakespeare without the plot, characters or setting. (And I like some of Shakespeare's works!) Magically speaking I also lack finesse. I tend to fire off spells as if I were hurling grenades.

So if you have any knowledge of DnD you'll see the links there. Bf is a wizard and I'm a sorcerer. He gets magic from study and books and teachers. I found magic by trial and intuition

Please consult with your doctor before attempting this

This is a blog post about prostration as a means of manifesting anything you want. Prostration must begin as something that feels as a poison to your mouth. Evidence of favoring prostration is evidence of being a sissy (not that there is a right and wrong here; I’m just sayin’). You must however be fully prepared to work yourself into a state of complete groveling, in a purely allegorical sense, you will have to open yourself up to what equates to spiritual “bum rape”.

In my practice, and from this perspective there is no ego to even prostrate. This is all very well and good; and really I’m just the biggest dork, but to get what you want you have to use a physical medium. Remember, the point of this is to manifest anything you want, period.

That’s right

1,000 consecutive bows.

1. Stand with your feet together and your arms at your side.
2. Raise your arms up over your head so your palms touch above your 7th chakra (crown)
3. Keeping your palms together
4. Keeping your knees straight (but not locked), over the top of your head, and ending where your eyes meet your nose … Cheth, 418, Cancer)
5. Engage your 2nd chakra (Luna) as you re-straighten your spine, with your knees on the ground.
6. Place both palms onto the ground in front of you
7. Keeping your forehead on the ground
8. Sit up and bring your hands into prayer in front of your chest and keeping your feet together, to support your body with your hands if you can’t stand up on your own … wimp)
9. As you return to a standing position
10. Repeat

That’s it. This usually takes about 2 hours. It is helpful to chant some kind of sacred mantra or text one word or character per bow. This assists in the deepening of trance, and mental junk that is released through this process in most practitioners. Chanting can also help keep track of the counting. For example, chanting a sacred text of 100 characters 10 times while doing this exercise will generate all kinds of Powerful Gnosis that simply gets jacked into your intent.

This is a form of prayer

I will repeat if you are in lousy physical shape

I prefer solitary

If you achieve the physical and energetic development necessary to do 1, and mind … then you can do 3,000 or 10,000. It sounds ludicrous I know, but these states of purity can be developed with daily practice. If you can easily do 1,000 of these bows, then you probably don’t need help or exercises to manifest what you want when you want it. Think about it. You can also train for 1, then increasing to 100. If you can easily do 100 bows everyday

1,000 bows will whack you out in a way glorious for Gnosis generation. If you think an orgasm snuffs out the flame of your ego, then 1,000 bows is going to bury the whole candle in sand.

Getting over yourself can be difficult. Once the body is pushed past the point of exhaustion, 1,000 bows guarantees it in 2 hours.

The rule in the Sanga from which I learned this practice was this:

If you have no desire for sex after the practice
If you have no desire for food after this practice
If you have no desire for sleep after this practice

Here is my stab at it: follow your work. 

Don't overthink it

 Is it tarot, do some meditation and/or visualization on your gear. Your work will begin to provide a gentle pull in some direction, you will sense it. 

Is your impulse and interest towards sigils? make a sigil, and eventually through you. 

Are you an aspiring Qabalist? Pick a sephiroth and climb towards it. Meditate and do vision work up to it

Are you into the dark stuff? Do some rituals

Scrying? One can buy a Ouija board at the toy store. One can turn a thrown away television into a black mirror. 

I have only listed a few techniques, your work will evolve through a process of self discovery. 

Is this stuff dangerous? It can be. At least for your mental health. But there are things to do for that

I was absolutely obsessed with UFO's and read books on alien abduction ( I was totally jealous of all the abductees that got to chill with bros from another planet) every night then spook myself silly trying to fall asleep. 

I had no idea about all this occult stuff at the time but essentially what I would do is visualize on drawings I did on greys/crop circles and try to contact them with my mind. I remember even going out into a park with rocks in a circle formations that I thought looked somewhat like a landing strip for a UFO and attempting to turn my body into a psychic beacon to call down the aliens to reveal themselves. Apparently a few people think this is dangerous because the greys are apparently evil and all that.

1373226608.0,1htg4q,Question of psychology/derealization/loss of soul?,croovis,18,4,31,"Hi all. I have a kind of psychological question

First, but I could compensate for it through using my rich imagination, or spending time outside and feeling connected to nature.
I think the older I got, etc), and less connected to nature and my imagination. However, believing my parents' religion (Christianity) still gave the world a bit of a soul for me.

When I moved away from home, and this seemed to be a temporary antidote to the loneliness. Eventually, I could no longer see the truth in Christianity, and lost my faith. I turned to existentialist philosophy for a time, and learned to see myself as more or less confined to my individuality, in an unfeeling, materialistic universe that lacked soul. This was not appealing to me

One day, isolated being in the universe, and this knowledge was enough put me on the precipice of annihilation. I could barely even accomplish day to day tasks. I soon had to spend almost 100% of time in the company of other people- to distract myself from the all consuming aloneness that was threatening my mind. This was good for me in a sense- I formed many beautiful relationships as a result of this pressure. But the experience itself has permanently altered me (I think).

I have never since felt as awful as I did for those weeks and months (happened 3 years ago). But there is some low level disturbance in my mind much of the time. Often times I feel very disconnected from the world. I have friends and family in my life, looking at the sky reminds me of the fundamental hollowness or emptiness of the world. I feel as though I live in a world of surfaces, a world that has lost its depth, lost the soul. It is mostly inert matter. Often times I don't feel at home in the world, or the universe, and it seems very alien and unfamiliar to me. Like being cosmically homeless, or a foreigner. Nature doesnt speak to me much. I am still very congnizant of cosmic aloneness. I think it is a problem of disconnection. It has led me to become obsessed with meaningfulness, connectedness

For years I have framed this as a spiritual problem. With my atheism has come a soulless universe, exploitative culture. But I'm starting to believe that the problem is probably just as much inside me as it is ""out there"". I just thought I was more perceptive and sensitive to reality than most people, but maybe thats a delusion.  Recently I have come across a psychological term called derealization- which kind of describes what I've been feeling. And this derealization is often created as a compensation for anxiety, or a way of dealing with unwanted thoughts and feelings- a sort of distancing from fearful unconscious contents. 

Does anybody have experience with this bizarre and unsettling feeling- of being unmoored from everything? Of being not at home in the world? Feeling like you don't belong or fit into the world (not socially

From ancient days in our culture April 1 has been known as All Fool's Day. This day is placed in the spring, at the end of the six month cycle of incarnational folly that began in autumn. The time period between the equinox of autumn and that of spring was regarded as the dark or nether half of the year when the earth is dead, the days short and the night of expectation long. The fool journeys forth into the lower worlds of earthly darkness for one half of the year, while the other half he spends in the bright sunshine of the divine worlds.

Thus the lower five sephiroth stand for the dark cycle of the year while the upper five may be symbolized by the sunny six months of spring and summer.

I said to him, and he said the same things. We kinda brought it up to each other throughout the day saying it will not rain and all that and lo and behold the rain cloud passed and we only realized it after the day was done.

I experimented with the same thing on a few occasions on my own. Saying it will not rain etc when I was going to go out on a day with a dark cloud in the sky and it worked. On two occasions I made it rain and both were while I was on the highway to another city.

I had a few other experiences I'll gloss over to get to my most recent one, and had a strange feeling of needing to get back into it. I'm not sure why. Just a feeling of getting drawn back into it...

I woke up this morning, it all seemed too complicated to me. I never followed a meditation technique or anything of the sort regularly.

I lay down. My mind is always racing with thoughts(diagnosed ADD), so I just let it drift, I try to think less and less. Whenever I begin to vocalize my thoughts in my head or actively think, if that makes sense, I feel myself slip away from the state I want to achieve. Eventually I get to a point where I notice my thoughts are getting pretty nonsensical, and they take on more of a day-dream type nature. Scenes, people, scenarios, let my brain do its thing and just try to keep that ""observer"" part of my consciousness awake. This morning, or try to focus on the vibrations

The vibrations were incredible, not quite sure how to describe it? My room was dark but I saw light, as if the whole room was lit up with a yellowish/white glow. And I freaked out, decided to stop and I tried moving.

I couldn't move at first. The light faded away rapidly and at the corner of my visions I saw objects of some sort I couldn't identify as they were gone as quickly as they had came. I tried moving for a few seconds

Some people spend so much time trying to AP, I'm 24, and it seems to come easily when I try. I've wanted to have a spiritual experience my entire life; to have some sort of experience with another world, to know there is more to life. I come so close and my fear holds me back.

I'm fearful of finding something, and I'm not one for prayer really; my spiritual interests have been in the occult. Thelema, Chaos, Kabbalah, some Eastern/Indian ideologies.

What should I do? I have no idea what to expect when I do AP

Isn't all thinking rational? To me it sounds like it's saying to people who're seeking meaning to their own interpretations and practices. There's a reality out there

Which is a round-a-bout way of saying people indulge in such things like tarot cards or i-ching to find answers from the universe. I am suggesting that this method is that *their own interpretations and practice*. 

On that assumption there's two points to consider:

* All of these interpretations and practices have no intrinsic value. They're used only internally

* The other point is something outrageous but rational. Hypothetically, we live in a reality mostly where time is two dimensional, our space is three dimensional. A different view of the same object (a persons lifeline) could show it as time as 1 dimension being the whole journey taken as one object. We cant imagine this object, but we can imagine a placeholder for it. We can then say this object represents a person life, but we can know more. Having this object doesn't give any insight into the decisions that person might have made and could have made. So, we could imagine infinite timelines all going off where the person made different decisions and choices. Treating all of these as one object, we can say we know all the information there is to know about this person and all outcomes to their choices. But we can still know more, all of the decisions they made or paths they could take and all the subsequent timelines these provide - and treat it all as one object. We know everything about this person

Under the assumption of the second point, god, whatever you want to call it. You can imagine - and very possibly that we can do real magic and real feats of impossibility easily. We do so by climbing the ladder of dimensions, extracting or viewing the information and crawling back down to the lower dimensions where you find your lifeline and use that information (for examaple, going into the object that stores all decisions of all people and seeing someone's future, then climbing back down to your lifeline and keeping that information on that person) . The problem is, the moment you climb dimensions your experience changes from your individualism, with no significance to the vessel you're currently attaining to be here

So, but they don't always translate into what the individual us, thinks they wanted. Also, there's no way of knowing if it happens or not, as an individual perspective. This is all probably very true and superficial for you all. But I wanted to type it anyway.

I propose that through meditation and narrowing/expanding the awareness it's worth exploring the boundaries of how far you can force your *this, and reflecting above, perhaps that's the most efficient way to become enlightened. But alas this experience of mine could be nothing more than the first point, and what is the difference. It just might be *my* own interpretations and practice.",,False,self,1337206914.0,t3_tpt1y

If we are all projecting from within, telling myths...I dunno, I guess it seems like an awful lot of energy to put into telling such disheartening stories.

&gt; “The Mighty One fell down upon the place where he is, but the company of the gods caught him and set him up again. [My] soul cometh and it speaketh with its father, and the Mighty One delivereth it from these eight31 crocodiles. I know them by their names and [what] they live upon, and I am he who hath delivered his father from them.”

&gt; “Get thee back, for that which is an abomination unto thee is in my belly, O thou that hast eaten the forehead of Osiris. I am Set.”

&gt; “Get thee back, and I will give him unto thee; let not thy flame be against me.”

&gt; “Get thee back, for that which is an abomination unto thee is in my belly; I advance, I am Osiris.”

&gt; “Get thee back, and I will give [him] unto thee; let not thy flame be against me.”

&gt; “Get thee back, and waste, and dirt, for that which is an abomination unto thee is in my belly; shall not the flame be on thy hand? I am Sept.”

&gt; “Get thee back

&gt; “Get thee back, for that which thou abominatest is in my belly; let [not] thy venom be upon my head, for I am Tem.”

&gt; “Get thee back

&gt; “The things which are created are in the hollow of my hand, the which are in heaven above me and in the earth beneath me. I have gained power, and exaltation, and a full-breathing throat in the abode of my father Ur (i.e., the Mighty One), and he hath delivered unto me the beautiful Amentet which destroyeth living men and women; but strong is its divine lord, who suffereth from weakness, therein day by day. My face is open, and nothing shall ever cast me to the ground.”

Psychological tolerance is the tolerance of the inconceivability of all phenomena.  Tolerance means to be at peace with.  Inconceivability means weird.  So in short

To that end there is a great practice I want to recommend.  It so happens that many of us have experienced a very terrifying moment.  For example, I had no head.  I was existentially and utterly terrified.  I've had many moments like this.  Another example would be having my seemingly human dream body stretch into what seemed like infinite space, and the scale of infinity would then cause terror in me.  These kinds of moments are very important in an occult practice and they are not to be thrown away and forgotten.  These moments of terror are the great treasures on the path!

The actual practice consists of relaxing and entering a meditative mood.  Once there, your totem, a symbolically important color, a rainbow, a mirror, a peacock feather, a pair of wings, a worthy companion and a true friend who doesn't lie.  Then mentally dissolve this vision of the meditational Terror deity inside your body and being.  As you do so

You should strive to feel a mixture of terror just as you remember it (to the extent it continues to terrify you), compassion, kindness, and peace of being utterly inseparable and on great terms with that terror.

Conclude by peaceful meditation or peaceful contemplation.

About ten years ago I was moving into my new apartment. The apartment itself was at least 70-100 years old and was two bedrooms.

This small 8x8 ""bedroom"" that just had a weird vibe every time you either looked in it or stepped inside.

I was moving some stuff in one night when I started feeling like I was being watched. From the master bedroom you could see through the kitchen

I thought I was going crazy as would most people. So I brought my friend over that same night and didn't say ANYTHING about the incident. Just told him to come check out my new place. I was in my bedroom setting up stuff when I hear him scream from the living room in absolute terror. I instantly knew what he saw

He shouts yes and we both run like madmen. In the car I get the same description from him without me giving him any details of what I saw so I could verify I wasn't crazy. He saw the same exact guy I saw.

We decide to bring his brother over under the same guise I had told him. We said nothing of what we saw. The brother enters. Without saying a word he goes into the creepy bedroom

He was joking. We freaked out and asked him why he did that and he replied. ""Seems like a room a guy would be in a straight jacket"".

That same day I had been reading Macbeth where Hecate is mentioned and then a third time in a poem I had read the week before.

I called this a 'coincidence' but on the advice of this witch I now call all such coincidences acts of 'serendipity' and write them down in my notebook.

I have a real great example of serendipity to write down.

Yesterday I was arguing with my girlfriend about the lyrics to 'windmills of your mind' and if they were used on a TV advert. I didn't really know the rest of the lyrics...

Today we were playing Trivial Pursuit (the board game where you go around the wheel answering trivia) and there were two questions on ""The Windmills of Your Mind"". 

We finished the game and switched on the TV. Behold

I googled the lyrics:

&gt;""Round like a circle in a spiral
&gt;
&gt;Like a wheel within a wheel
&gt;
&gt;Never ending on beginning
&gt;
&gt;On an ever-spinning reel.""
&gt;

Now the plot thickens. The last three books I read were The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac

All three of these discuss the idea of time and space as being a repeating

The game trivial pursuit board also embodies this process in the game play as well as bearing some resemblance to the Buddhist Dharma Wheel although fewer spokes (I understand the importance of the spokes in the dharma wheel as being the noble eight-fold paths)

I've been playing hooky from occult skool lately and amassing quite a pile of philosophy books. I minored in philosophy and spent years reading all the pomos and cultural anthropologists. I never took a liking to the classics and enlightenment thinking until I started seeking a ""dark"" reading of Marx and/or Hegel. 

Eventually i discovered ""political theology"", Kojeve, Leo Strauss, Voegelin etc and the rest is history.

It seems as though a Straussian reading of natural law

This is fascinating stuff.

Basically

The Machiavellian answer is contrary to the idea of evil being some peripheral

Rather

So basically we are talking about an institutional academic reading of political philosophy as luciferianism.

The Straussian reading is William Cooper/behold a pale horse level radical atheism. But really these guys are just saying what the real function of religion/government has always been. 

God building is deification of man and by extension the men who populate the eye of the temple and ""edit"" the religious scripture. While state building is the deification of ""architecture"" of the logos or the practical application of the ""Law"".

Anyways

I have oscillated from hard left progressive to hard right/anarchist/libertarian progressive (fold up all large institutions) in the last year and dont see myself going back.

I largely feel as though most occult practice is formative and transitory

In other words after 3-4 years in the OTO/Masons you are likely to be face-smashed against the glass ceiling of radically diminishing returns.

I will always meditate and practice yoga, I will likely leave them to the more adventurous and less ominous among you.

If it weren't for my head-on excursion into the occult a few years ago I wold never have come to the conclusions I have come to and would have never really ""got"" philosophy.

For the first time in my life

Studying the occult for me, psycholinguistics, general semantics. It's not that I read for things that aren't there rather, I interpret the text based on the malleability of my paradigm as a tool of meaning in and of itself.

I am of course not implying that all philosophers are ""saying the same thing""


For philosophy to be real, continually blaspheme against not only popular convention but even one's most deeply held ""intellectual"" beliefs.

And this may be where beginning occult studies is most crucial. When one transgresses the former limits of your culturally given self, this experience is jungian.

It may be like astral travel for the first time. You were never aware you could fully leave the body or take off a paradigm and play dress up with other paradigms arbitrarily.

Without experiencing this or ""receiving"" this secret teaching

In fact, are two sides of the same coin.

The process we saw from renaissance philosophy and the enlightenment was this compulsion to wrest objective scientific thought free from the theocratic political violence of the church. 

Heliocentrism while clearly an ""occult"" and mystically rooted concept was proved true with Math and geometry and a few daring minds.

It was such a beautiful paradox that took place because the church had become a violent and brain dead status quo totalitarian zombie stifling all thouany.

Then you had a ""bubble"" of extremely intelligent and quirky hermetic/gnostic/jacobin/rosicrucian/Masonic groups

No doubt they believed their mystical teachings of Hermes etc. yet their fantastical thought sort of cancelled out the overt dogma of the church and an ""objective"" system of science and reason was born! Wtf?

This short alchemical ""bubble"" epoch was humanities Hegelian moment of blasphemy where first the philosophers were mystified by jumbled up anachronistic misreadings and mistranslations of near east and far east alchemy while simultaneously using their secret meetings and mystical starry eyed empowerment to hash out the integral and delta y. Calculus

And at the core of all of this is the meaning and limits of language.

So Basically IMO, cosmopolitan secular world we have now is a direct result of the fruits of the enlightenment.

For all of post-modernisms naivety and inept political inadequacy

Specifically, Derrida and Foucault, and all their talk about the ""text"", schizophrenia and bio-politics, were ironically, or deceptively AFFIRMING the magical structure and power of language. 

Existentialism and post-structuralisms pre-occupation with language being this kind of infinite regression in the absence of ""grand signifiers"" is basically EXACTLY what you have on an individual and collective level when people lose the power of shamanic/mythic meaning making.

I see a definite lineage from Enlightenment to post-modernism to chaos magic. Fascinating stuff.

What is so frustrating about some of the rock stars of that movement like Foucault for example, magic and anthropology and his whole schtick. For Chris sake his whole thing was about how language bound the body to a new type of ""liberal"" totalitarianism. Baudrillard on the other hand, you can tell he was a broken mystic.

And if Foucault speaks of the effects of ""sanitized"" and institional language on the body, echoing and distorting before ""massaging"" (steam rolling) the body in society. Paul Virilio continues Mcluhans thinking in a more ethical, perhaps less anthropological, regard.

So what? Well I think the point is that these people whether they are atheist materialists or pantheistic mystics, imbue reality with a type of meaning, inevitably effacing reality. They don't read history after the fact, they write it in its realist sense.

It's like all of existentialism and the post-modern cannon was this grand canyon like tour to the edge of the abyss of God and meaning and all those french fucks did was spend the past 70-80 years finding every conceivable way and every style possible of *describing* the Inpenetrable unnapproachability (how very Kantian of them) of this abyss that they were standing a couple Hundred feet from. 

Of course some smart asses (thank God) in the crowd (peter lamborn wilson

I would like to qualify all of what I have said. While I am currently doing a Nietzschean/Straussian reading of history and ""meaning""

Ephemeralization and tight quarters in the noosphere spells destruction if we continue down the didactic path.

Low-prep working to aid an opportunity for employment

I used the Thoth Tarot to conceptualize the situation and desired result. The cards were not used in a divinatory manor but as a means of Qabalistic analysis and a point of focus. Upon the cards I placed token items for further symbolization. I am quite satisfied with this technique as a means of analysis and as a ritual device.

This device was created very simply, which combines Qabalistic analysis with personal intuitive / artistic composition. The device was created in less than two hours from items on-hand; I feel it is complete and functional but I may refine it further.

*****

Ace of Wands

Two of Wands - Dominion

Three of Wands - Virtue


Trump XIV - Art


Six of Swords - Science

Six of Wands - Victory

Six of Disks - Success

Six of Cups - Pleasure


The ace, here representing the appropriateness and worthiness of the endeavor. The token here is a glyph stone of my own design whose symbolic content relates to the opening of doors and the sphere of intellect. 

The central card, the place of the final four cards, it stands here representative of manifestation towards a more perfect goal state from the Foundation of the present (the date 9/9).  The six-petaled token is a simplified version of a personal symbol / tool of Qabalistic analysis, and its rainbow petals here also suggest the refraction of the fiery spirit into the full spectrum of elemental expression below in Tiphareth.

The four sixes proceed from left to right. The applied intellectual faculties of Science are presented first
After Science comes Victory - in the literal of this working this refers to getting the job itself. The fiery will has reached its goal in Tiphareth. A shining metal rosette serves as a token of solar glory. 

Victory brings Success and the will's journey brings physical rewards. A key wrapped in green thread represents a new and peaceful place to live

The final fruit is Pleasure

1327682608.0,oza5n,A study of which way the court cards face in the R-W tarot deck.,spellraiser,13,2,8,"I just love falling down rabbit holes that get deeper and deeper. This happened when I decided to study if there was any pattern to which way the figures in the court cards in the Rider-Waite deck face. The idea came to me as a flash of intuition in a meditation session.

This is how it looks like (in the order page, king):

    &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;  - Swords
    &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt;  - Wands
    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;  - Cups
    &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt; - Pentacles

The only caveats is that the king of swords is somewhat ambiguous

Anyway, queen and kings, two are looking to the left and two are looking to the right. Within each suit, the knight always faces in the same direction as the king, while the queen faces the opposite direction. Two of the pages face the same way as the queen, and the other two face the same way as the king and knight. There's also a lot going on visually, but I won't go into the details as it's fairly obvious.

It's always somewhat dubious to claim with certainty that some pattern that you are presented with is definitely not random

It gets even more interesting when you decide to interpret this information as binary numbers. Of course, but it turns out that this is somewhat irrelevant.

In the former case we get this:

    &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 1010 = 10 - Swords
    &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 0010 = 2 - Wands
    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 0101 = 5 - Cups
    &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 1101 = 13 - Pentacles

While in the latter case we get this:

    &gt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 0101 = 5 - Swords
    &lt;&lt;&gt;&lt; = 1101 = 13 - Wands
    &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 1010 = 10 - Cups
    &gt;&gt;&lt;&gt; = 0010 = 2 - Pentacles

So, it *only* happens when two of the suits are the exact inverses of the other two suits, as is the case with the pattern under consideration. When this applies, two of the suits are obviously constrained by the other two, so we only really have freedom to arrange two suits. The way in which two suits can be arranged has 2^8 possibilities, while the entire arrangement of four suits has 2^16 possibilities. So the ratio of arrangements that have the property of defining a unique set of numbers in binary no matter which encoding you use is (2^8 / 2^16) * 100 = 0.390625%. Again, this in no way proves conclusively that the pattern was selected so that it has this property (let's call it Property P for future reference)

And we're not quite out of the rabbit hole yet. Let's look at some of the properties of these numbers

    2 -&gt; 2
    5 -&gt; 5
    10 -&gt; 1
    13 -&gt; 4

So we have the numbers 1 - 5

    2 + 5 + 10 + 13 -&gt; 30 -&gt; 3 (All the sets that have Property P happen to add up to 30 btw)

Or like this:

    2 + 5 + 1 + 4 -&gt; 12 -&gt; 3

I checked all the sets that have Property P (there's actually only 28 of them if you ignore the ordering of the suits and disclude the sets of repeated pairs, 13, 13), where it's obvious that you're never going to get a set of four distinct reciprocals) and found the set 1, 14, 4, 11 is the only other set that maps to the reciprocals 1, 4 and 5

Let's finally order the eight sets mentioned

    0 - 15
    1 - 14
    2 - 13
    3 - 12
    4 - 11
    5 - 10
    6 - 9
    7 - 8

The pair 2 - 13 is third from the top
