1365420742.0,1bwtkz,[Tip] My advice for Korean beginners/intermediates,prBun,124,10,29,"I’ve been self-studying Korean for about 8 months now. Here are some things I’ve discovered along the way that I wish I’d known sooner. I know this is a long post but if you’re in the first few months of learning

**1. EVERYTHING that I learnt before learning the alphabet was a WASTE OF TIME.**

I started off using Pimsleur’s Korean, not understanding them. Seeing the words written in 한글 not only helps you with pronunciation, but also makes understanding the changes words undergo for grammar purposes a lot easier.

**2. I was using Anki poorly and why Memrise will eventually fail you. (tip 3 is about how Anki fucking rocks with the new updates and when you use it properly)**

Any vocabulary I learnt before using Anki and Memrise would naturally be too easy to forget. Nobody else is going to ask you to recall the word for ‘tree’ enough times for it to be nearly impossible to forget. 

Memrise helped me type so much faster in Korean because of the practice and time pressure. The old leaderboards were a huge incentive for me to keep planting new words. The old Anki showed a timer in the bottom right counting up, and it allowed me to sit there for a long time getting frustrated with my bad memory. There was also a red bar that indicated I was struggling. 

I was refusing to click “again” in Anki because I felt like I should be remembering these words… huge mistake. It meant that words I didn’t even know would then come up less and less frequently.

However

**3. Two Anki tips that will change the way you learn vocabulary**

So I decided to go back to Anki

The best thing I did was to mark myself harshly. If you take nothing else from this post, but as many times as it takes.

The second best thing I did with Anki was to create my own deck. It’s hard to beat the process of finding a solid definition for the word using Naver or Daum dictionaries

**4. Listen to the language

I see a lot of tips about how much K-dramas help you learn. There are definitely positives of watching Korean films

But if you want to use K-dramas as a learning tool

Whenever a character says something slowly enough that you can break down what they are saying or whenever you read the subtitles and think “Hey, so try this out. Next time you hear those words being said, you should be able to understand it without subtitles. 

If you don’t understand a word of it, this is a great skill to have.

Sorry for taking the fun out of K-dramas haha.

**5. Don’t be afraid to learn GRAMMAR

Hey I know that word! Hang on why have they done that to it? How does that change the nuance?

One thing that makes Korean so difficult is the number of endings that slightly change the intended meaning of a sentence. Recently I’ve copied those endings into Google

If you don’t know what I’m talking about

There’s a list at the bottom of the page

**6. Lang-8. Wow.**

“This free Korean lesson was brought to you by TalkToMeInKorean.com and HaruKorean.com

What they don’t tell you is that there is an already well-established website for native corrections

Lang-8.com functions on L points, I’ll scratch yours’ mentality. And often you’ll get a good explanation as to where you went wrong.

Hope this helps. Feel free to discuss your own experiences :)

* English overview: http://www.korean.go.kr/hangeul/cpron/04_sound/02.htm
* Korean full rules: http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02.jsp

The overview is incomplete

I assume you all know what a 받침 is

* Conjugation: plain verbs and descriptive verbs change shape. I'll call this conjugation.
* Utterance-final: when you will pronounce nothing afterwards
* Stop: When airflow stops (in one way or another) I'll call that a stop. Examples are ㅂㄷㄱ for oral stops
* Fricative: Hissing sounds like ㅅㅆ.
* Affricate: When a stop meets a fricative it's an affricate. Examples are ㅈㅉ.
* Aspiration: ㅍㅌㅋㅊ are aspirated. When a puff of air comes out of your mouth it's aspiration. Hold up a piece of tissue to your mouth and say ""star"" and ""tar"": the puff will be there for ""tar.""
* Fortis: ""Double"" sounds like ㅃㄸㄲㅆㅉ. I'll call them fortis.
* Lenis: Not fortis
* Assimilation: When one sound becomes similar to another
* Reduction: I don't know what the proper name is. I'll just call it reduction. (You'll see what it is by reading the rules.) If something gets deleted by being reduced
* Morpheme: if something within a word carries meaning, that's a morpheme.
     * Morphemes are defined as the smallest things that carry/change meaning. BTW
* Grammatical morpheme: morphemes that serve a grammatical function (Korean particles
* Lexical morpheme: ""meaty-part"" morphemes that don't serve grammatical functions but instead make nouns or verb roots, etc.

And some conventions:

* // slashes denote sounds before sound-change rules. The ""idea"" of the sound
* [] square brackets denote sounds as they are pronounced. ""Physical"" sounds
* &amp;lt;&gt; angle brackets denote letters as they are written

## [Consonants and vowels](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0202.jsp)

* 5.1. &amp;lt;져, 쩌, 처].
* 5.2. /ㅖ/ may be pronounced [ㅔ]. /예, 례].
* 5.3. If a syllable starts with a consonant
* 5.4. The syllable /의/ may be pronounced [의] or [이] if it doesn't start a word. The particle &amp;lt;의&gt; may be pronounced /에/. 

## [받침](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0204.jsp)

* 8. Only seven consonants are allowed in utterance-final position. They are [ㅂㄷㄱㅁㄴㅇㄹ]. Other consonants are reduced to [ㅂㄷㄱㅁㄴㅇㄹ].
* 9. Oral stops, [ㅂㄷㄱ].
* 12.1. /ㅎ/ causes aspiration to following lenis stops, /ㅂ/ doesn't appear in conjugation, and /ㅎ/ only ends syllables in conjugation.)
* 12.2. /ㅎ/ causes fortition to following lenis fricatives: /ㅅ/ becomes [ㅆ]
* 12.3. /ㅎ/ is reduced to [ㄷ]
* 12.4. /ㅎ/ is deleted before a verb stem that starts with a vowel.
* 15. If a 받침 meets a lexical morpheme that starts with /ㅏㅓㅗㅜㅟ/
* 15.1. Rule 15 explains [마덥따]. Rule 15.1 says that [마싣따] and [마딛따] are both good pronunciations for &lt;맛있다&gt;.

## [Assimilation](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0205.jsp)

* 17. 받침 /ㄷㅌ/ + /ㅣ/ -&gt; [지
* 18. Anything that's reduced to [ㅂㄷㄱ] is nasalized and pronounced [ㅁㄴㅇ] before nasals [ㅁㄴ]. (The nasal [ㅇ] cannot start a syllable.)
* 19. /ㅂㄱㅁㅇ/ + /ㄹ/ -&gt; /ㅂㄱㅁㅇ/ + /ㄴ/ -&gt; [ㅁㅇ] + [ㄴ]
* 20. /ㄴ/ + /ㄹ/ -&gt; [ㄹㄹ]

## [Fortition](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0206.jsp)

* 23. If [ㅂㄷㄱㅅㅈ] come after anything that's reduced to [ㅂㄷㄱ]
* 24. In conjugation
* 25. In conjugation
* 26. In Hanja-based words
* 26.1. But not when there's reduplication of Hanja like in [허허실실] or [절절하다].
* 27. After the attributive conjugation /ㄹ/
* 28. In places where you might expect a 사이시옷

## [Insertion](http://www.korean.go.kr/09_new/dic/rule/rule02_0207.jsp)

* 29. In compound words and derived words
* 29.1. This is before rule 20
* 30.1. If a 사이시옷 comes before a syllable that starts with /ㅂㄷㄱㅅㅈ/ then it causes fortition to [ㅃㄸㄲㅆㅉ]. The 사이시옷 is meant to be reduced to zero in principle
* 30.2. Rule 18 applies to 사이시옷 as well. It's reduced to [ㄷ] so it's pronounced [ㄴ] before nasals [ㅁㄴ]. (The nasal [ㅇ] cannot start a syllable.)
* 30.3. Rule 29 sort of applies to 사이시옷 as well. If the front part ends with a 사이시옷 and the following part has an /이/ sound or has the vowel /ㅕㅠ/ then /ㄴ/ is inserted: /베갯잇/ -&gt; [베갠닏]",,t5_2rd8q,1365429639.0,,native,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Korean/comments/18n2jv/official_rules_of_korean_pronunciation_summarized/

**당신:**

1) ""당신"" can be used by one spouse to another, the same way we might use affectionate names between couples in English; first names are also commonly used between couples. (Or for a more direct approach to saying ""you"" informally, although usually not rude between couples, 너 may also be used.)

2) ""당신"" can be used to refer to ""you"" when not specifically referring to anyone; an example would be if you saw a self-motivation sign that said ""You're special."" (""당신은 특별한 사람입니다."") It's also used in example Korean sentences

In many situations

**너:**

(Also pronounced ""니"" in some dialects)

1) ""너"" is safe to use between friends, and animals. (In the case of animals, you should always use the lowest form of Korean) However, it's still good to use polite Korean to children, as the parents will worry if you're teaching their children the ""correct"" way to speak.

2) ""너"" can be used between dating couples, and other callings such as 누나/오빠/etc are the norm).

3) Never use ""너"" to anyone older than you. However, or give you permission to.

1352237889.0,12r3sv,What is the throat clearing sound that ajummas make when they are complaining?,stoopidjonny,29,6,37,I thought it was a peculiarity of my mother-in-law to sound like she was hocking up phlegm when she was complaining about something until I heard a woman do the same thing on a Korean radio station.  My question is is this connected to some letter like ㄲ or ㅎ?  Because it sounds as if she is using it within a word instead of just making a sound.  I don't know if it is just used by older women or not.  I only have heard two women use it.  Also I would like to know in what context it is used.  I'm not sure if it is used to express irritation or lamentation.  ,t5_2rd8q,True
1346660058.0,z9t1k,[Tip] Useful Hanja,Pikmeir,26,5,6,"I often read posts on r/learnjapanese discussing how useful/worthless it is to know Japanese characters (Kanji) when learning Japanese. Well

**1)** Knowing Hanja will let you understand new words your first time hearing/seeing them. For example, (聞)문 = to hear, (不)불 = not/isn't, (如)여 = like/similar, (一)일 = one, (見)견 = to see. ""Hearing something a hundred times isn't like seeing it once."" If you know basic Hanja, not only would this be easier to understand, Korean is filled with Chinese idioms like this (as is Chinese and Japanese)

**2)** Your vocabulary will expand exponentially each new Hanja you learn. Say you learn the Hanja for ""month"" (月)월,"" you can now say 월말 which means ""end of the month."" If you learn (週)주, for ""week,"" you can now also say/understand 주말 for ""end of the week"" automatically without having to learn it separately.

**3)** You can closely guess a word's meaning without having ever learned the word, you can do this through Hanja. For example, take the word 무제한. If you know (無)무 for ""none,"" you can guess that the word's meaning must be something like ""(having) no 제한."" Assume you don't know the word 제한, but you did learn the word (限)한 which is also a simple Hanja that means ""limit,"" you could easily guess that 제한 must also mean ""limit"" so you get ""unlimited"" from the full word. If you didn't even know 한, you could probably still understand the word from the context of the sentence only knowing 무.

**4)** You will be respected as a real Korean learner. Although being a foreigner learning Korean already gets you 100 cool points with Korean people, which will bring upon them an eternally burning shame toward their ancestors. But actually, you'll find that many older people are familiar with Hanja, and it will bring you up a full level of maturity in their eyes through learning it.

**Here are some good sites for learning Hanja for free online:**

[Hanja - Korean Wiki Project](http://www.koreanwikiproject.com/wiki/index.php?title=Hanja)

[Learn Korean's Hanja Lessons](http://www.learnkorean.com/whanja/hclassindex.asp)

1359933343.0,17tzmr,[Tip] For those extracting audio samples from ttmik lessons: how to download from naver's dictionary,qkwym,26,2,1,"I've seen two people mentioning how they extracted the audio samples for their anki cards from ttmik lessons. I used to do the same thing when I started my deck

First of all

Now, then search for the word in [naver's Korean dictionary](http://krdic.naver.com/), and you'll get a download link for that word's audio. You'll find most Korean words in there, except for slang, cursing, etc. For those, try [forvo](http://www.forvo.com/).

**Extra tip**: You probably want to add [replaygain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replaygain) tags to your files so that they'll have equal loudness. In linux, you can use [mp3gain](http://mp3gain.sourceforge.net/faq.php). In windows, if you don't run [cygwin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cygwin), you can try doing it with [winamp](http://blog.winamp.com/2009/08/24/automatic-volume-leveling-in-winamp-with-replay-gain/) or maybe some other program, I can't really test since I don't have a windows machine available.

**Second extra tip**: Again, [here](http://pastebin.com/Rmk0P5WU) is a script to download the mp3 directly from the command line. Just call it with the words you want, for example:

    ./naver.sh 가다 오다 하다

You can also generate a list with all the words in your deck by clicking in anki File &gt; Export (or pressing Ctrl-E), and then running something like the following (which will select only the first field in the note, then only the hangul, then sort and remove duplicates, then download each one) (note you can also use xargs here, but if your deck is big enough it will fail because of too many arguments):

    cut -f 1 notes.txt | grep -Po '[가-힣]+' | sort -u | while read word; do ./naver.sh ""$word""; done

I suppose this could be even more broadly answered by the huge use of English in the Korean language. But it just seems odd that they would use things like keo-pi or ba-suh rather than having their own word. Or perhaps there is a more ""korean word"" but the conglish word has come to dominate?

The TAC is a competition between the various language learning communities of Reddit to learn as much of their target language as possible in a year.  The competition began in January

The idea is pretty simple.  Every week on Sunday, or anything else you want to post about your Korean studies in the previous week.  You can also comment on other posts asking questions or for advice, or simply to provide encouragement.  At the end of the year, a judge will determine which team was the best organized and had the best participation.  Team members help encourage and help each other another along the journey of learning Korean!  

By keeping a log each week and seeing how others are overcoming their challenges

This is my experience, no matter how good you get at Korean, this fact will not change. Korean people who are not good at English will be afraid to talk to you and constantly apologize that they cannot speak English, while those wanting to practice their English skills will seek you out. Not always, but often enough, people will insist on speaking to you in English despite you being fully capable of having the conversation in Korean.

In addition, you better have tough skin.

That said, people talk to them despite me responding and despite them not knowing a single word in Korean. However, this can also be a curse; Korean American friends have told me how rude people can be to them if their Korean isn't perfect, accusing their parents of not raising them correctly.

Unfortunately for me

*Summary at the bottom (When I started writing I didn't know I would make this big of a post)*

**Background**

About 6 weeks ago I decided I want to learn Korean for various reasons. I had gotten my hands on a book called *Colloquial Korean* and from here on started learning from this book.

A month ago I found out about this subreddit. I've read a lot of topics with people being in the exact same position as me. I got a ton of useful links and websites. However

**Story so far**

First two weeks I tried to master Hangul and all the characters involved. This boosted my motivation greatly

This is where I started on the actual lessons. The book is set up in a way that it teaches you a bit of grammar, friends). Audio is also included.

I am now nearly done with the third lesson. So at this point I:

* Have a vocabulary of 200-250 words
* Can form basic sentences with proper grammar as long as the 200-250 words I know are used
* Could speak a simple dialogue using my very limited vocabulary


**My question / the problem**

On this subreddit the general advise is to read a lot of Korean in the form of transcripts/books/comics and/or to watch Korean TV/shows/series.

So my initial thought upon reading this advise was ""Yeah! Makes sense

I started watching a Korean drama and started reading a comic

* Spoken Korean in an actual TV series goes really fast for the untrained mind. But even worse, sometimes I heard a subject case marker or whatever piece of grammar I've already learned, but it's not like I can guess the meaning of a sentence, because I simply do not know the nouns and words used. So does this actually help? I feel like I should just expand my vocabulary knowledge to at least 1500~ words, before I can start understanding entire sentences.
* Same goes for the reading. I open up a comic and I find myself lost in the first bubble. I'm like ""Yeah, nor what this verb means.."". Then I end up using a translator for the most part, and I think to myself: I should actually just be 'grinding' words - expand my vocab. Is it beneficial to keep reading this?
* This is a bit unrelated to the rest of the post, built-in honorific verbs, sentence endings and social ladder. Am I going down a proper path here, or am I wasting my time with things that might not be all that important nowadays?


**To summarize (TL;DR):**
Should I drastically expand my vocabulary before even thinking about watching a Korean show / read a comic. Or should I just watch/read these even though I understand about 1% of it?

Another difficult part of my situation is I have a job that keeps me very busy. I have been known to work 70 and 80 hour weeks (rarely, however, I have a job that frequently interrupts my study schedule so it's hard to form a habit.

So tonight I realized that a lot of the advice I've been taking regarding Korean has been from learners who aren't fluent. It made me wonder... why aren't they fluent? Why are these bloggers that dedicate so much time to learning a language not seeing good results?

I decided to search Google for foreigners who have actually become fluent in Korean. Well

Now while I couldn't find the advice of foreigners that became fluent in Korean

The *main* thing all these guys advocate is the **need to get rid of one-to-one translations** (at least eventually). They create an extra required step in our heads that slows us down in listening and speaking. Don't just take my word for it

1265768442.0,b061y,"[초보자의] This is mine, that's yours, that over there is his!",chem_vixen,10,11, and that (far away object - over there). This seems pretty straightforward but very useful in learning the Korean languages.

- This: 이것 (written)

- That: 그것 (written)

- That (over there): 저것 (written)

So some simple examples of how to use these words:

1) 그것 뭐야? What is that? (Used for close proximity to the object). In the case of an object far away write (or speak) 저것 뭐야?

2) 저거 누구예요? Who is that? 

3) 이것 누구 책이에요? Whose book is this?

Pretty easy no? How about places? Let's talk about the words: here

- Here: 여기

- There: 거기

- There (far away): 저기

You'll probably notice these are very similar to one another. Hopefully this makes things easier

Some examples:

1) 지금 거기 희남 있어요? Is Heenam there now?

2) 여기는 미국이에요. This is America.

3) 제 가방은 저기 있어요. My bag is over there.

EDIT: Thanks *roflburger* for bringing up a good point I missed. You can also use these pronouns to demonstrate

- 이 + noun = this noun ---&gt; Ex: 이책은 재미있어요. (This book is interesting.)

- 그 + noun = that noun ---&gt; Ex: 그사람은 한국사람 이에요. (That person is Korean.)

- 저 + noun = that noun over there ---&gt; Ex. 저건물이 뭐예요? (What building is that over there?)

- 어느 + noun = which noun ---&gt; 어느극장이 뭐예요? (Which theater is this?)

- *To want* (a noun)


We have previously discussed ""to want"" but this was for verbs (-고 싶다). However


Examples to show the distinction:

1) 자고 싶어요. (I want to sleep.)

2) 엄마가 자고 싶어해요. (Mom wants to sleep.)

3) 차를 훤해요. (I want tea.)


- *currently doing/happening*


Aside from present tense you can express that you're currently doing something or something is happening right now using -고 있어요. Just attach to the verb stem.


Examples: 

1) 먹고 있어요. (I'm currently eating.)

2) 책을 읽고 있어요. (I'm currently reading a book.)


- *to have to


Use this to express that you have to or need to do something. Using -야 되다


Examples:


1) 자야 돼요. (I have to/need to sleep.)


2) 화학을 공부해야 돼요. (I have to study chemistry.)


- *can/be able to*


Take the verb stem and add -(으)ㄹ 수 있어요 to express ability. Depending on the verb stem ending


Examples:


1) 김치를 먹을 수 있어요. (I can eat kimchi.)


2)  학교에 갈 수 있어요. (I can go to school.)


- *may/have permission to*


To express that you may or have permission to do something


Examples:


1) 가도 돼요. (I may go.)


2) 밥을 먹어도돼 돼요. (I have permission to eat the rice.)

And you'll learn that there are certain sounds in English you will not hear in Korean and sometimes the lines are a little fuzzy between some sounds because they are similar (i.e. ㄱ g/k sound).
 
But once you've familiarized yourself with the alphabet and the accompanying sounds

- Each syllable starts with a consonant.
- Must contain atleast one consonant and one vowel. 
- Placement of consonants depends on the vowel used. For example:

리 : The consonant goes first and is *to the left* of the vowel because it is a vertical vowel.

조 : The consonant goes first and is *above* the vowel because it is a horizontal vowel. 

You'll notice that there are more complex constructions of syllables

Dear Mr. and Mrs. Lee

Everything is good here. The weather is getting hot which I like and the outside world looks beautiful. 

I am glad to hear Chaemoon is well.  Even after all these months we are still getting used to a quiet house.  My heart skips a beat every time he texts me (even if it is 2am ^^).  Everything still reminds us of him and I think it always will. You have raised a wonderful son

I know Chaemoon is making some big decisions for his life right now. If he comes back here, but this time it’s not over in a year. I can guarantee to provide, love and protect him to the very best of my ability. That I promise you. My prayer each night is for him to be happy and successful. 

I thank you sincerely for the gifts. They were very thoughtful and sweet. I am sure Chaemoon has told you that I don’t have very good fashion sense so when I took the bag to church everyone said “Chaemoon sent that to you didn’t he? How do you live without him?” 

Truly we are the ones that are thankful to you and are in debt to you. We have prayed many years for a family and then Chaemoon came. The pride and joy you feel each time you look at your children we got to feel too. We were able to experience those everyday moments that families have. It was the most priceless gift we could have received. 

May God bless your family always.

This is a basic recap of the skype chat on Sunday, feel free to comment and add/correct :)

First - quick introductions

Second - listening and speaking practice using 취미 (취미가 뭐예요?)
During this part we discovered that lots of people play and enjoy watching Starcraft 2 - 스타2하는 사람들이 많이 있는데요!

Third - ~하는 것 vs ~하기 which in many cases means the same thing

Fourth - ~한지 / (으)ㄴ지 paired with 되다 which we use to mean ""since"" in the time sense rather than the ""since"" using the because sense.  This one was kinda stumping me a little

Fifth - ~하기로 하다 (마음을 먹다)

Sixth - ㄹ pronunciation guide

Seventh - 가/까/카 pronunciation comparison - put your hand over your mouth and say each sound; 가 and 카 push air out of your mouth while 까 won't push out much of any.  **Special note - ** women and men pronounce this a little differently

Eighth - we were going to do 받침 but around this time we had biscuits and his ... wife? girlfriend? who bumped it up a notch.  We did some vocabulary quizzes ranging from words like 학교 &amp; 병원 to ""inlaws on the mother's side"" (I don't remember the word)

Ninth - Counting to five using the hanja 正 ([http://dicimg.naver.com/hanja/stroke/11-09-15-05.gif](http://dicimg.naver.com/hanja/stroke/11-09-15-05.gif) for stroke order)

Tenth - Throat clearing sound mostly used by older people or for funny/emphasis

Eleventh - Idioms and ""사자성어"" (4 character idioms based on Chinese characters"" (e.g. 고진감래)

- 와 and 과:  this is used as and to link two nouns together. Use 와 when the noun does not have a final consonant and 과 when there is a final consonant present. Examples of both cases: 너와 나 (You and I) and 책과 음악 (books and music)

1263864003.0,ar8nq,[중급의]Adjectives,chem_vixen,9,1,11,"Seems like a pretty straight forward concept in English: adjectives. In Korean


So to make adjectives

1) Regular verbs: Drop '다' from the verb and add 'ㄴ' or '은' depending on the ending of the verb.

Ex: 행복하다 (v. to be happy) --&gt; 행복하 + 'ㄴ' = 행복한 (adj)

행복한 사람 (happy person)


2) For verbs that end in 'ㅂ' - drop the 'ㅂ' and add 우 + 'ㄴ' to make the adjective

Ex: 덥다 (v. to be hot) --&gt; 더 + 우 + ㄴ = 더운 (adj)

버운밥 (hot rice/meal)


3) verbs ending in 'ㄹ' - drop the 'ㄹ' and add 'ㄴ'

Ex: 멀다 (v. to be far away) --&gt; 머 + ㄴ = 먼 (adj)

먼집 (far away house)


4) 있다/없다 verbs - drop '다' and add '는' to make an adjective

Ex: 재미없다 (v. to not be interesting) --&gt; 재미없 + 는 = 재미없는 

재미없는 사람


Ok


**HOMEWORK**
Take these verbs provided here and convert them into an adjective. Once you've done that

4) 크다


5) 재미있다


6) 멋있다


7) 맜있다

9) 길다


10) 춥다


**EDIT**

1261246748.0,agjl9,[초보자의] I really want to...but I can't!,chem_vixen,8,1,8,"This lesson is going to be about two common phrases ""to want to"" and ""can't"".


**To want to**

In order to express your desire to do something you use ""-고 싶다"" with verbs that express action. So to use it you take the desire you are trying to express


SP: 자고 싶어요.

I: 자고 싶어.


Pretty straight forward, if you use the verb 보다 (to see) with this phrase, '보고 싶어요' can mean ""I want to see"" but can also be used to express 'I miss you'. 


**Can't**

In order to say that you 'can't' do something, but for 하다 verbs the placement is a little different. For verbs like, 좋아하다, the adverb gets placed in front of the verb as well: 못 좋아해요 (I can't like). However, for verbs like 전화하다 (to call), which is constructed from a noun + 하다 then you place 못 in between the noun and 하다: 전화 못 해요. (I can't call.)


**HOMEWORK**

As request by one of the readers, if you don't have the Korean keyboard installed then write it out by hand and if you can take a picture and post that here.

1) Take the following verbs and express your desire to want to and also express that you can't in Formal

a. 일하다 (to work)

b. 울다 (to cry)

c. 여행하다 (to travel)

d. 읽다 (to read)

e. 가다 (to go)

f. 사다 (to buy)

g. 마시다 (to drink)

h. 공부하다 (to study) 


2. Take your skills a step further and express the above conjugations in Past and Future tenses. 


3. Translate the following sentences in English:

a. 저는 진짜로 김치를 먹고 싶어요!

b. 희남씨는 소주를 못 마셔요.

c. 저는 안 일고 싶어! 

d. 책을 사고 싶어요. 

e. 못 봐요!!!! 

f. 기은씨는 진짜로 한국에 가고 싶어요.

1) Topic marking particle (은/는) - This follows the topic noun of a descriptive sentence.

- 희남은 키가 각아요. (Heenam is small.)

- 정호는 키가 커요. (Jeongho is big.)


2) Object marking particles (을/를) - These are used to indicate the object of the sentence and imply that an action is being taken. So this indicates what/whom the action is being performed on.

- 아만다가 커피를 마셔요. (Amanda drinks a coffee.)

- 키은이 아침을 먹어요. (Kieun eats breakfast.)


3) Subject particles (이/가) - These determine the subject of a sentence that depicts an action is being done so this indicated the who is doing the action. (See the above object particle examples.)


4) Location particles (에/에서) - 에 is used for directional movement to an indicated location while 에서 is a setting or location of an activity.

- 마이클은 내일 LA에 가요. (Michael goes to LA tomorrow.)

- 혁는 병원에서 일해요. (Hyuck works at a hospital.)


5) Comparison particles (도

1) **Integrated Korean** developed by the Korean Language Education and Research Center.

2) **Elementary Korean** Which is definitely a good place to start if you are a [beginner](http://www.amazon.com/Elementary-Korean-Tuttle-Language-Library/dp/0804836140) with not much knowledge on Korean. This book is then complimented by **Continuing Korean** which is proceeds to [more advanced](http://www.amazon.com/Continuing-Korean-Ross-King/dp/080483430X) studies of the Korean language.


3) **National Institute of the Korean Language and The International Korean Language Foundation Series** This series is also pretty basic but one of the [textbooks](http://www.amazon.com/Listening-Korean-Beginners-w-CDs/dp/1565912470/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260972684&amp;sr=1-3) also includes audio which is really useful in learning how to pronounce the characters.


4) **Sogang Series** This [series of books](http://www.amazon.com/Sogang-Korean-various-authors-Song-hee/dp/8976995775/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1260973002&amp;sr=1-2) comes highly recommended

**EDIT:** 5) **Korean Made Easy** This is another basic beginner [book](http://www.amazon.com/Korean-Made-Easy-w-CD/dp/B0027Z4KZW/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1261020293&amp;sr=8-2) which also has a phrase book and CD to accompany the lessons. I own this one and it's good for the basics but it doesn't seem very easy to acquire. But


If you need help with *reading/writing Hangul* then I suggest you head over to the [KoreanClass101.com channel on Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hvcKYW5ustw). I know it's not a textbook

**EDIT2** 6) **Active Korean** (as suggested by *aussiekevin*) Another [series](http://hanbooks.com/acko1wcd.html) which promises to be on par with Integrated Korean. Also includes CDs which is good for learning pronunciation.

일 + 하다 (""work"" + ""to do"") = 일하다 (to work)

공부 + 하다 (""study"" + ""to do"") = 공부하다 (to study)

사랑 + 하다 (""love"" + ""to do"") = 사랑하다 (to love)

And hopefully you get the gist by now. So how are hada verbs conjugated in present tense? As with the normal verbs previously discussed the verb stem 다 is dropped and the ending for all 하다 verbs are as follows:

Formal: 합니다 ( 하 + ㅂ니다)

SP: 해요 (하 + 여요)

I: 해 (하+ 여)


So since this applies to all hada verbs let's conjugate the above three examples in the various levels of politeness:


**공부하다**

F: 공부합니다

SP: 공부해요

I: 공부해


**일하다**

F: 일합니다

SP: 일해요

I: 일해


**사랑하다**

F: 사랑합니다

I: 사랑해

The exercise is to fill in the blanks with 이/가

Question 2 is:
A: 소피아씨
B: 네
A: 아니요. 저 --- 2학년이에요.

So A is asking B if she(sophia) is a sophmore
to which B(sophia) replys to A by saying that Yes, which i assume is Lisa, if they are also a sophmore, which would be the 도 particle because asking if she is to?
But this is where I got really confused
""A: 아니요. 저___2학년이에요.""  also the particle for the blank here i used 는 would this be correct?

So to summurize my questions are 
Is this a missprint in the year number on A's reply?  or am i missreading this?
and
Are my choices in particles correct?

1359922324.0,17tmaj,Tip for using Korean programs where gibberish is displayed (need native locale),sojubang,8,1,0,"As I shared with some of you last night (if you were on IRC)

The problem comes when you have two conflicting programs that both need their locale to be something else. In my case, when I typed in Korean only ""?"" would be displayed. Nothing else would work, so don't go hitting the comment button unless you have some truly amazing method that not everyone knows about :)

This was fine until I needed to launch a VM which uses two physical HD's attached to my machine. It saved the location as ₩₩, using VMWare Workstation without the physical devices was not an option and restarting my computer to change the locale and thereby disable it in the process just to play a game was not an option either.

Enter Applocale. https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=13209

If you download and install this (either run the command prompt as administrator to run the .msi or disable UAC on Windows 7)

I'm submitting this because it seems like a much more attractive option to those of us that either want to maintain their locale or have programs that have conflicting locale requirements. Anyway,False,,t5_2rd8q,False,,,t3_17tmaj

But that’s hard without a class, and then goes into using it in the lesson. I understand the grammar, but not so much the vocab. I think my main problem with it is the lack of cognates. Compared to Spanish, where you can refer to TONS of nouns, which are pronounced super similarly in the same alphabet, Korean uses hangul to express cognates differently. Furthermore, there are very few cognates. In any case, and there are worksheets. Should I use these two in conjunction? The problem with that is you learn expressions first grammar later. But maybe that’s not necessarily bad? Same as with Spanish

Also, but it is often said as 니가 for ease of pronunciation and to avoid confusion with 내가. To add to that, she also said that 니가 is not actually a word.

Can anybody explain this further? Or did my mom cover everything correctly?

Finally, but I can hardly hear it. I also asked one of my Korean friends, and she said that there is no difference. It's possible that because she's younger she was taught that there is no difference, meaning that recently the discrepancy has been more or less phased out.

I won't be finished with college for another three years so I have plenty of time to start learning korean now so that I will be very prepared when I get there.

I've read stories from korean people who dislike when foreigners come to korea with no intention of ever learning the culture or the language. Fortunately for me that is not the case. I've been very interested in the korean culture for a good while now and as said above

**On to the point**

I started learning basic hangul. I was told it was the best place to start. I have a pretty good understanding of it so far give or take a few things here and there. 

My biggest question is where do I go from here? Should I focus on grammar? Learning to pronounce hangul and then further my knowledge on how to read it? It's getting a bit overwhelming having to teach myself due to lack of classes where I'm from (US

To learn hangul I used these websites:

http://quizlet.com/267257/korean-alphabet-pronunciation-flash-cards/
http://rki.kbs.co.kr/learn_korean/lessons/e_index.htm#

I've been told to STAY AWAY from Rosetta Stone as much as possible. At the same time though I've read it's a good start for beginners. 

My free time is at this time

edit: **I am very serious about learning korean for the next 3years.**

“26일 오후 2시 건양대병원. 평범해 보이는 소년이 피아노 선율과 함께 병원 자선 음악회에서 부를 가곡을 연습하고 있다. 스스로 ‘뼈 나이와 생각 나이는 40대 중반’이라는 어른스런 소년가장 최선봉군(18·대전예고 2년)이다. 성악을 시작한 지 3년. 그는 평범한 가정에서도 뒷바라지가 힘들다는 예술고등학교에서 성악을 전공한다.
“대전 한 터미널 인근 나이트클럽에서 성악가를 초청한 적이 있었어요. 손님에게 껌을 팔기 위해 업소에 들어갔는데 음악을 듣는 순간 전기에 감전되는 것 같았죠.”
하지만 최군은 원하는 공부를 할 수 있는 형편이 못된다. 태어나자마자 부모에게 버림받은 후 서울의 한 보육원에 맡겨져 5살 때까지 지내다 ‘탈출’했다. 이후 대전에 정착해 길에서 자랐다.
“배가 고프니까 어린 나이에도 뭐든 하게 되더라고요. 터미널에 오가는 사람에게 껌과 박카스를 팔면서 하루하루 생활했어요. 잠은 계단이나 화장실에서 잤죠.”
껌팔이 생활만 10여 년. 14세 때 터미널 인근 떡볶이 아주머니의 권유로 야간학교에 입학했다. 초·중등 검정고시를 차례로 합격하고 ‘노래’를 가르쳐줄 선생님을 무작정 찾아 나섰다. 이때 만나 조건 없이 성악을 가르쳐준 분이 아버지나 다름없는 박정소씨(33·루체음악학원장)다. 정규 교육을 받지 못해 처음에는 악보조차 읽지 못했지만 박씨를 만난 후 열심히 연습해 예술고에 입학했다. 예고생에게는 필수인 레슨비와 생활비를 벌기 위해 1년 전부터 옥천의 한 물류센터에서 오후 8시부터 다음날 오전 7시까지 야간일을 하고 있다. 건양대 병원에 입원하게 된 것도 일하던 중 높은 곳에서 떨어져 다리를 심하게 다쳤기 때문이다.
최군은 요즘 성악을 포기해야겠다는 결심을 굳히고 있다. 1년 더 공부해 음대에 진학하고 싶지만 지금도 어려운 형편인데다 성인이 되면 정부의 학비 지원마저 끊기기 때문에 등록금 마련부터 걱정이다.
“이 길이 내 길이 아닌지
최군은 이번 자선음악회를 끝으로 성악을 그만둘지 모른다. 그런데 꿈을 꺾어야겠다고 다짐할수록 자꾸만 하늘을 바라보게 되는 이유는 무엇일까. &lt;봉아름 기자&gt;

In general the 다 is dropped and the following is added to the verb stem for the different levels:

- Formal: -ㅂ니다 or 습니다 (mnida or seumnida) For stems ending in vowels use ㅂ니다 and for verbs ending in consonants use 습니다

- For Standard Politeness and Informal we use the 아/어/여 (a/eo/yeo) conjugation. 

아 is for verbs that have ㅏ or ㅗ  as the last vowel in the verb stem

어 is for verbs that don't have ㅏ or ㅗ as the last vowel in the verb stem 

(여 is for hada verbs and we'll get to those later)

EDIT: If the*verbs end in a vowel* you follow these rules for the termination of the verb stem. 

For ㅏ

1. ㅏ + ㅏ = ㅏ

2. ㅗ + ㅏ = ㅘ ('wa' sound)

For other verbs:

3. ㅓ + ㅓ = ㅓ

4. ㅜ + ㅓ = ㅝ ('wo' sound)

5. ㅡ + ㅓ = ㅓ

6. ㅣ + ㅓ = ㅕ 

7. ㅐ + ㅓ = ㅐ('ae' sound)

EDIT: If the *verb ends in a consonant* you just tack on either the 아 or 어 to the existing verb stem.

And to make the distinction between Standard Politeness and Informal you add 요 ('yo') to the Standard Politeness conjugation. Check out [this](http://imgur.com/fUNW2.png) for some examples.
