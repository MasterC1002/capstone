Also KimmoKM the neckbeard/'butthurt dweller' guy stated in an IRC interview that the reason he didn't attempt to improve his health and fitness was because he would simply:
&gt;replace my[his] biological parts with mechanical when the technology advances enough

It seems that many people use transhumanism to excuse their present inaction and in their desire to believe in some great future they are vulnerable to 'techno-cults' which are behave much the same as the predatory religions they so often despise.

For me Transhumanism is about working hard to advance what we have at the moment (and indeed MIRI and SENS are parts of that) whilst using everything at our disposal to maximise our potential whether it is nootropics and tDCS to attempt to increase cognitive ability or nutritional information

I had no idea such visual enhancement was even possible, modafinil and other performance enhancing drugs and nootropics then is current legislation just holding us back?

I mean at the moment supplements are largely unregulated and thus the industry is little better than snake oil salesmen. However, were relaxed but the regulation tightened and people educated about the various risks then surely everyone could strive to achieve more?

Also there are the physical modifications such as the contact lenses mentioned above and the extremely high-tech swimming gear, even genetic manipulation prior to birth.

It seems stupid that we apply the same rules about 'cheating' to every sphere of life that are required for the highly artificial environment of competitive sport.

The rules don't even make sense, but if you do so in college you are cheating?

It just seems bizarre that we could achieve so much more with the intelligent and informed application of existing technology and yet we act like the Amish and shun the possibility in the most irrational way. This isn't quasi-science fiction about mind uploading and swarms of nanobots

Intelligence is the raw material of human achievement. Every distinction between man and animal is the result of our exceptional brains. 

Even though the forces of evolution have not ceased to work on us, respectively. A society of minds informed only by evolutionary signals can never transcend the animal kingdom from which we arose. 

To fulfill our potential and transcend our animal roots it is necessary to further develop our individual minds. The field of cognitive enhancement exists to do just that. 

Imagine the consequences of, or even simply among those involved in government. Such a shift would change the course of history in radical ways. What may strike you as science fiction is not far off in scientific terms--the fields of neurology and psychopharmacology are moving quickly and our understanding of the biological infrastructure of intelligence is growing accordingly. 

The statement that people use on average only 10% of their brains has been proven to be a myth

The safe and effective “smart drugs” that are our best and nearest bet for sustainable cognitive enhancement are just around the corner. In fact

There exist a few options for those looking for a mental boost, Adderall and its relatives are more productivity enhancers than intelligence enhancers, and their beneficial effects come with the risks of neurotoxicity, heart problems, and addiction.

More promising is the large and diverse class of chemical known as nootropics. The term “nootropic” refers to any substance that improves mental function and is neuroprotective or at the very least entirely nontoxic. To qualify as a nootropic a compound must be effectively free from negative side effects. The original nootropic is Piracetam, as well as a noticeable gain in the perception of visual and audial contrast. A number of studies support its beneficial effects on subjects with Down Syndrome, dyslexia, and dementia, as well as on simply aged or even perfectly healthy brains (see papers published by the labs of Ennaceur, Wilsher, and Schuer).

Other nootropics include DMAE (dimethylethanolamine) and choline: precursors to the neurotransmitter acetylcholine
	
Though not technically a nootropic

Many other nootropics and miscellaneous “smart drugs” exist in various stages of research, the better able we are to deliver focused and safe therapies to enhance it.	

The field of cognitive enhancement is exciting and fast-paced. However, effective, and safe, and might be a widespread reality sooner than you think.

************************************************************************************

""Tell me, though there was still a hint of pain in his eyes), ""why do Dark Wizards fear death so greatly?""

""Er, I've got to back the Dark Wizards on that one.""

""What?"" said Dumbledore.

""Death is bad, and does not, in fact, indicate that you have a psychological problem.""

The Headmaster was staring at him as though he'd just turned into a cat.

""Okay, there's this Muggle thing called a suicide prevention hotline -""

""When it is time

Harry was frowning sternly. ""That doesn't sound like you have a very strong will to live

""Harry..."" The old wizard's voice was starting to sound a little helpless; and he had paced to a spot where his silver beard, and was slowly taking on a greenish tinge that crept up the hairs. ""I think I may have not made myself clear. Dark Wizards are not eager to live. They fear death. They do not reach up toward the sun's light, but flee the coming of night into infinitely darker caverns of their own making, without moon or stars. It is not life they desire, but immortality; and they are so driven to grasp at it that they will sacrifice their very souls! Do you want to live forever, Harry?""

""Yes, proof by induction on the positive integers. If you don't want to die, it means you want to live forever. If you don't want to live forever, it means you want to die. You've got to do one or the other... I'm not getting through here, am I.""

The two cultures stared at each other across a vast gap of incommensurability.

""I have lived a hundred and ten years, too many of which I wish I had never seen or done. And yet I do not regret being alive, for watching my students grow is a joy that has not begun to wear on me. But I would not wish to live so long that it does! What would you do with eternity, Harry?""

Harry took a deep breath. ""Meet all the interesting people in the world, celebrate my first great-great-great grandchild's hundredth birthday party around the Rings of Saturn, learn the deepest and final rules of Nature, understand the nature of consciousness, find out why anything exists in the first place, visit other stars, discover aliens, rendezvous with everyone for a party on the other side of the Milky Way once we've explored the whole thing

""I did not understand much of that, as you run and run from death.""

""Life is not a finite list of things that you check off before you're allowed to die

Dumbledore sighed. His fingers drummed on a clock; as they touched it,"" said the old wizard, ""I do not think I would mind. But two hundred years would be entirely too much of a good thing.""

""Yes, his voice a little dry as he thought of his Mum and Dad and their allotted span if Harry didn't do something about it, ""I suspect, Headmaster, that if you came from a culture where people were accustomed to living four hundred years, that dying at two hundred would seem just as tragically premature as dying at, say, on that last word.

""Perhaps, and yet others still live, for whose sake you must stay..."" Dumbledore's eyes were fixed on Harry, and growing sad. ""Do not mourn me too greatly, Harry, when my time comes; I will be with those I have long missed, on our next great adventure.""

""Oh!"" Harry said in sudden realization. ""You believe in an afterlife. I got the impression wizards didn't have religion?""

************************************************************************************
(skipped a bit)

Dumbledore appeared to be fighting a struggle within himself. ""Harry, ""this is a dangerous road you are walking, I am not sure I do the right thing by saying this, but I must wrench you from this way! Harry, how could Voldemort have survived the death of his body if he did not have a soul?""

And that was when Harry realized that there was exactly one person who'd originally told Professor McGonagall that the Dark Lord was still alive in the first place; and it was the crazy Headmaster of their madhouse of a school

""Good question, only he loaded it in advance with a complete copy of his brain state. Or something like that."" Harry was suddenly far from sure that he was trying to come up with an explanation for something that had actually happened. ""Actually, can you just go ahead and tell me everything you know about how the Dark Lord survived and what it might take to kill him?"" If he even still exists as more than Quibbler headlines.

""You are not fooling me, and lined by more than years. ""I know why you are truly asking that question. No, I do not read your mind, I do not have to, your hesitation gives you away! You seek the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for yourself!""

""Wrong! I want the secret of the Dark Lord's immortality in order to use it for everyone!""",,t5_2qh2k,1337451383.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Transhuman/comments/tss72/harry_potter_and_the_methods_of_rationality_on/

5. Fish oil 

6. TA65

7. Possibly resveratrol if you want tk risk it.

/u/flam3srock makes a good list in comments

&gt;What might work:

&gt;c60 in olive oil

&gt;metformin

&gt;calorie restriction with optimal nutrition (CRON)

&gt;methionine restriction

&gt;mTOR inhibitors ie rapamycin

&gt;heavy doses of astragalus extract/ta65/cycloastrogenol

&gt;epitalon

&gt;OPC containing supplements including

&gt;curcumin

&gt;fo-ti

&gt;apple cider vinegar

&gt;There are many other herbs and drugs. But IMO you need to do everything right outside of supplementation for maximum effect.

They're Made out of Meat
a short story by Terry Bisson
 
 
""They're made out of meat."" 
 
""Meat?"" 
 
""Yes
 
""Really?"" 
 
""There's no doubt about it. We picked up several from different parts of the planet
 
""That's impossible. What about the radio signals? The messages to the stars?"" 
 
""They use the radio waves to talk
 
""So who made the machines? That's who we want to contact."" 
 
""They made the machines. That's what I'm trying to tell you. Meat made the machines.""  
 
""That's ridiculous. How can meat make a machine? You're asking me to believe in sentient meat."" 
 
""I'm not asking you
 
""Maybe they're like the orfolei. You know
 
""Nope. They're born meat and they die meat. We studied them for several of their life spans
 
""Spare me. Okay
 
""Nope. We thought of that, we probed them. They're meat all the way through."" 
 
""No brain?"" 
 
""Oh
 
""So ... what does the thinking?""  
 
""You're not understanding
 
""Thinking meat! You're asking me to believe in thinking meat!"" 

""Yes
 
""Omigod. You're serious then. They're made out of meat."" 
 
""Thank you. Finally. Yes. They are indeed made out of meat. And they've been trying to get in touch with us for almost a hundred of their years."" 
 
""Omigod. So what does this meat have in mind?"" 
 
""First it wants to talk to us. Then I imagine it wants to explore the Universe
 
""We're supposed to talk to meat."" 
 
""That's the idea. That's the message they're sending out by radio. 'Hello. Anyone out there. Anybody home.' That sort of thing."" 
 
""They actually do talk, concepts?"" 
 
""Oh
 
""I thought you just told me they used radio."" 
 
""They do
 
""Omigod. Singing meat. This is altogether too much. So what do you advise?"" 
 
""Officially or unofficially?""  
 
""Both."" 
 
""Officially, without prejudice, fear or favor. Unofficially, I advise that we erase the records and forget the whole thing."" 
 
""I was hoping you would say that."" 
 
""It seems harsh
 
""I agree one hundred percent. What's there to say? 'Hello
 
""Just one. They can travel to other planets in special meat containers, in fact."" 
 
""So we just pretend there's no one home in the Universe."" 
 
""That's it.""  
 
""Cruel. But you said it yourself
 
""They'll be considered crackpots if they do. We went into their heads and smoothed out their meat so that we're just a dream to them."" 
 
""A dream to meat! How strangely appropriate
 
""And we marked the entire sector unoccupied."" 
 
""Good. Agreed
 
""Yes
 
""They always come around."" 
 
""And why not? Imagine how unbearably

SENS has had a very good past year.  Not only is our cause becoming better known to the scientific community, but causes related to it.  We have found that some of the best and most effectual assets in helping our research are the volunteers that work on behalf of SENS.  Even doing minimal, part time work makes a huge difference and as a volunteer, I can say that many of the people who work for and with me have provided tremendous help to the cause.  

I am working for SENS because I believe they and their vision can transform our world for the better.  For any of those interested in doing the same

In the possible future where mind uploading becomes possible, because that body will be merely an avatar.  If that person has done something which causes a government entity to want to incarcerate him, they can take the avatar body, jail it, even destroy it, but the actual consciousness of the person could exist elsewhere in a remote server cloud, and possibly even redundantly so.  At that point in time the idea that you can lock away and control a person merely by restraining and restricting their current body becomes risible.

And even in a future closer than 2045, and such implants would even enable remote communication and control with other humans and systems, which would interfere with the government's ability to prevent that person from influencing the world outside the jail.

So in both these scenarios, making the idea of jail pointless...unless the jail paradigm were to be modified as well, which would involve ever increasingly complex measures to isolate and control ever changing posthuman entities.  This would of course have pretty large impacts for government who incessantly work to expunge terrorists.

Thoughts?

It's possible we could extend life a hundred even a thousand more years, but humans already live to be much older than almost every animal on earth and it still hardly seems satisfying to go out at 100, and miss the uncountable years afterwards. I would think having life limited at the age of the sun, you'd just have more wonderful experiences and knowledge to lose, making the death all the more poignant.

The usual argument against immortality is that it would be terrible watching everything you love die around you, then everything around you can too, and if everything you love can't last forever, then neither can you, since we're all made of the same stuff.

&gt;A report has been issued from Steve Treder. The report states:

&gt;“The police have confirmation that Mike left Detroit and entered Canada last week. We don’t know why. But with no evidence that violence has been done to him

&gt;Another statement by the family says: “We believe he went on his own volition and is safe. So there is no longer a need for an investigation into his whereabouts. The family would like to thank everyone for their concern.”

&gt;Here’s a news article on the matter:

2. We must back up our statements. We are not the only school of thought that looks to anticipate the future. Other paradigms exist. Just like those paradigms of thought, and rational thought to the table or our statements can be dismissed as easily as those claiming that supernatural entities will bring about the end of the world.
3. We must be honest with ourselves. If we are not familiar with the valid criticisms of our arguments, or simply acknowledge their beliefs are equally valid.
4. We must discard non-falsifiables. If there is no way to back up a statement other than 'time will tell'
5. We must understand that we see things differently from mainstream culture. If you are going to make radical statements, that moderation or rephrasing may be warranted.
6. We must understand that we see things different from each other. No two futurists will necessarily share the same views on politics, or even precisely what technologies, trends, and changes may emerge or be wrought upon the world. Expecting otherwise by default will only lead to sectarianism. In addition to perspective, cultural differences exist as well.
7. We must not conflate our hopes and dreams with what will absolutely happen. While technology progresses naturally

these implants will be put inder my finger tips into the sensitive nerve cluster and will react to electric and magnetic fields alowing me to feel these fields just like a breeze.

The races competing in this far-future world represent various lines that will be points of contention as transhumanism becomes the driving force behind our evolution.

CLASSIFICATION 0, which are protected as wildlife preserves. Their ability to protect this land from higher beings, should such beings ever decide to take it away, is nonexistent.

CLASSIFICATION 1, not seen as a legitimate military power by most of the higher-classification beings. Some purists, classified “1i,” are willing to cooperate with non-self-aware AIs such as thinking attack drones that can execute combat missions without needing to be controlled from a remote location.

CLASSIFICATION 2, posthumans) who reject cybernetics to the same degree as or to a greater degree than Classification 1 humans. However, they are fully open to gene therapy, eugenics, and outright genetic enhancement. They can be subdivided into Classification 2a, representing humans who accept only genetic modifications that would not cause them to exceed the bounds or anatomical forms of “natural” humans, and Classification 2b, reptilian skin, due to their willingness to transcend human physical and/or mental boundaries. However

CLASSIFICATION 3, and will instead choose forms based on things like starships, submersibles, and land vehicles. Many change their physical form regularly. Some, referred to as “Classification 3-multi,” are comfortable with operating multiple copies of their neural structure in multiple physical housings that might be light years apart. What sets them apart from higher-classification posthumans is their unwillingness to give up the brain. They require any modifications to their physical form to preserve the neural structure and operation of the biological brain they were born with. Additional software that supplements this structure is accepted by most, but any software must be subservient to the “Neuro-seed, they can often compete for resources on fronts that are deemed too unimportant by higher classification beings to commit too much energy to. They rule the fringes of space. In the case of “Hard 3s, as it would be redundant. The line between a “non-self-aware AI” and the neural accessory processors used by Class 3s is virtually nonexistent.

Calssification 4: “Independent AIs” Posthumans who have given up every vestige of what biological humanity represented. They take whatever forms they wish, and network with others like them to pool information and resources. Where they have drawn the line is at individuality. Each Classification 4 being has an identity at the core of their software, dating back to a human birth and upbringing in the annals of the past. They refuse to be subsumed into any form of collective consciousness, and are capable of keeping secrets and making decisions independent of the input of other entities. Classification 4s were the dominant force in the galaxy for a great while, before the rise of their successor. Even today, they still control large portions of rich space that the “Great Enemy” has not yet devoted time and resources to dominating. They fight amongst each-other uncommonly, and in some areas battle guerrilla bands of Classification 3s looking to carve resources off the edges of their territory. They regard their primary opponent with a sort of Cold War, for now.

Classification 5: “PHMO” Referred to as “Pheemo” by those beings who still use their mouths to articulate language (and are even aware of its existence), as well as all recorded knowledge, of every human and computer that contributed to its mainframes at some point in the past. It can access, analyze, and synthesize all of this data with perfect recall and at the speed of light, collating it with the new data it is collecting constantly from all of its networked sensor units. There is no doubt that PHMO has become the dominant force in the Milky Way galaxy, and in all likelihood may already be operating beyond it. Few are operating under the delusion that it couldn’t wipe out all lower-classification beings if it really wanted to. Class 4s have fought massive engagements with its fleets too many times to count, it seems to have deemed to tolerate lesser intelligent existences operating in its shadow. How long that state of affairs will last,,

how do you purpose we solve possible future overpopulation or too much crowding on earth?

How do you purpose we use technology to eliminate 'evil' and 'suffering' if there is great disagreement  as to what their true meaning is?

How do we prevent possible criminals (if we do not eliminate evil) murdering people who do not choose transhumanism immortality? 

How do we prevent the exploitation of life extension technology? How do we prevent the select few from keeping it all to their selves?

What is your opinion on virtual reality for life extension?

What is your opinion on cyborgs and replacing our body parts with newly grown parts?

What will happen to those who do not choose transhumanist technology? 
What if someone decides they want to die
How will this process work? 

How will transhumanism affect the physical universe?

How do we prevent biotechnology from becoming too expensive for a human payed an average income?

How would transhumanism affect the economy

How would transhumanist technology affect rationality

I'm very interested in working on research that contributes to transhumanism in some way, and I'm choosing between two labs right now.

The first lab is working on lab-on-a-chip stuff

The second lab is developing a means of drug delivery based on gold nanoparticles.

Both professors have similar h-index ratings--for the lab-on-a-chip professor, hard to get a hold of but has a lot of connections and reputation.

For the nanoparticle professor, not as many connections but did a postdoc with one of the most famous chemists in the world so that's a good connection to have.  He's not tenured, but I think he'll get it within a few years.

Any input would be appreciated.  I feel like the lab-on-a-chip stuff would be good for eventually working towards developing nanorobotics

Hey there Reddit.

My name is Colin Popell. 

I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company, and it leaves much to be desired.

A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing

So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.

**How are we going to do this?** I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.

We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers

**Where do we want to go with this?** Well, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.

I’m a transhumanist too, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.

**How can you help us?** Pretty easy, but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.

Sorry, new supplement company wants to set a scientific and business standard, wants your business, wants to support the community, and wants data on your nootropic habits.

think we have to do something.  Think of my post as a plea about what should we do to achieve transhumanism.

My favorite name is improvehumanity.com... but I don't want to limit myself to transhuman topics with that name. Improvehumanity might be better saved for transhuman topics, disease, etc. Maybe take an extropy approach with that name? I'm also found of fortheloveoftranshumanity, but that's a little long. Thoughts?

Other thoughts:

- I'm not sure I want to go with transhumanism as the name

Thoughts? I hope this is allowed here.
