1340667525.0,vlln5,Louis CK is bypassing crap like Ticketmaster and scalpers by selling tickets for his upcoming tour directly and cancelling tickets that are resold for more.,indefiniteaxiom,89,5,45,"Text from his newsletter:

hello folks!  I'm going on tour this  year from October through
Feb.  I'll be all over the goddamn place.  This year
something new
selling my content online.  We are selling tickets to this tour
exclusively here on louisck.com.  I only wanted to do this if
there was a way
bring the price of tickets down and make them easier and less
complicated to buy.  We figured out a way.

Making my shows affordable has always been my goal but two things
have always worked against that.  High ticket charges and ticket
re-sellers marking up the prices.  Some ticketing services charge
more than 40% over the ticket price and
I've made my ticket prices
up

By selling the tickets exclusively on my site
ticket charges way down and absorbed them into the ticket price.
To buy a ticket
buy the damn thing.   opt in to the email list if you want
you'll only get emails from me.

Also
anything above the original price
your ticket (and refund your money).  this is something I intend
to enforce.  There are some other rules you may find annoying but
they are meant to prevent someone who has no intention of seeing
the show from buying the ticket and just flipping it for twice
the price from a thousand miles away.

Some of these rules may be a pain in your ass
patient.  My goal here is that people coming to see my shows are
able to pay a fair price and that they be paying just for a
ticket.  Not also paying an exhorbanant fee for the privalege of
buying a ticket.

Tickets across the board
what you'll actually pay.  In every case
anyone has actually  paid to see me (after ticket charges)  in
about two years and in most cases it's about half of what you
paid last year.

The benifit for me is that I won't get angry emails from anyone
who paid a ton of money to see me due to circumstances out of my
control.  That makes me VERY happy.  The 45 dollars also includes
sales tax
depending on the state.

Another benifit to me is also one to you.  I get your email
address (if you opt in) when you opt in.  You don't have to join
ANYTHING to buy these tickets and if you opt in
from me once in an old man's jizz-cycle.

Obviously  none of this means anything if the shows aren't good.
So that's up to me.  As I do every year
brand new hour (or more) on all of these shows.

Lastly
that could work with our exclusive ticketing service under these
perameters.  It means I'm playing in very new places.  I really
appreciate all of these theaters that are letting us give this a
try.

Setting up this tour has been fascinating and difficult.  this
ticketing service is a brand new thing and I really fucking hope
it works and that there aren't any problems.  If anything comes
up

Doing things this way means I""m making less than I would have
made if I did a standard tour
expensive ticketing service.  In some cities I've had to play
smaller venues and do more shows.  But I like doing more shows
and about a year ago I reached a place where I realized I am
making enough money doing comedy so the next thing that
interested me is bringing your price down.  Either way
make a whole lot more than my grandfather who taught math and
raised chickens in Michigan.

alright
folks on the opt-in list and sending a separate email that lays
it out much more simply with the proper links.  I am doing this
because when I emailed you about LIVE AT CARNEGIE HALL
still on sale for 5 dollars!) about half of the people who got
the email really enjoyed the long
The other half HATED it and would have preffered a price
and me shutting the fuck up.

This way
massive shit-ball of text and throw it in the garbage
on the simple email.

I hope to see you all on the road.

regards

Louis C.K.

Secondly

You could tell he was thinking 'OK

Was it just me? Or did you think he was less confident this time? He's such an absolute pro that his lines were delivered flawlessly

Perhaps because when he filmed The Beacon he was in an all-or-nothing mood. But since that was a huge success (along with the series) he suddenly feels like he's got everything to lose.

Someone released a recording from an early show on the tour, I think the overall tenor of the act was better -- more confident and fun. It didn't seem like he was truly enjoying himself in the special.

Am I missing something? It just seems like these are two very different versions of his early career. [The Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_ck#Early_life_and_career) seems to support the latter version.

1365908209.0,1cb1bg,Louis sent out this email about his HBO Oh My God special.,shakeanjake,5,1,0,"Hello. This is Louis C.K. I'm writing for two reasons. Maybe three

Reason one. I want to thank everyone who came out to see me on the road this year. I have never traveled so much and done so many shows. The tour covered over 100 shows in 39 cities. 300 thousand people came to see me. I can't think of one city where I didn't have a great time. That doesn't mean there wasn't one. I just can't think of it right now. Anyway there really wasn't one. (I'm so tempted to say ""except Tampa"" or something
Everywhere I went
I would also like to say thank you for participating in the experiment of buying the tickets directly from my site. We found that, rather than Cohiba smoking loafers with no socks dudes who buy their tickets on stubhub and brag about how much they had to pay. Not to disparage anyone who smokes Cohibas and fits that description. But yeah, I'd rather see a tired looking couple who got a sitter and took the bus into town and they have a great time but then at the end of the show they are leaning on each other and sleeping. But they had row one tickets and they didn't have to pay some douche a bunch of money. 
Okay so that's about tour. 

Toward the end of the tour I recorded 4 shows at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix Arizona
I picked the Celebrity theater because George Carlin shot one in that same place
Anyway

""Louis CK Oh My GOd"" will also be available on my website, for the same 5 bucks you pay for all my shit that is there.

Okay so please watch the special and enjoy it. 

Lastly I'd like to apologize for all of you who have been confronted with my stupid fucking face as you go down into the subway, or buy Roling Stone Magazine, or the magazine two magazines down from Rolling Stone. Or the one next to that. 

I'd like to write more or, but I have noodles and a chicken just finishing and my kids need to eat in front of project runway. Then I'm going to Radio City to see Donaire beat the shit out of that guy who's name begins with R., right after my special airs. 

Thanks again for everything.

&gt;Hello. This is Louis C.K. I'm writing for two reasons. Maybe three
&gt;
&gt;Reason one. I want to thank everyone who came out to see me on the road this year. I have never traveled so much and done so many shows. The tour covered over 100 shows in 39 cities. 300 thousand people came to see me. I can't think of one city where I didn't have a great time. That doesn't mean there wasn't one. I just can't think of it right now. Anyway there really wasn't one. (I'm so tempted to say ""except Tampa"" or something
&gt;Everywhere I went
&gt;I would also like to say thank you for participating in the experiment of buying the tickets directly from my site. We found that, rather than Cohiba smoking loafers with no socks dudes who buy their tickets on stubhub and brag about how much they had to pay. Not to disparage anyone who smokes Cohibas and fits that description. But yeah, I'd rather see a tired looking couple who got a sitter and took the bus into town and they have a great time but then at the end of the show they are leaning on each other and sleeping. But they had row one tickets and they didn't have to pay some douche a bunch of money. 
&gt;Okay so that's about tour. 
&gt;
&gt;Toward the end of the tour I recorded 4 shows at the Celebrity Theater in Phoenix Arizona
&gt;I picked the Celebrity theater because George Carlin shot one in that same place
&gt;Anyway
&gt;
&gt;""Louis CK Oh My GOd"" will also be available on my website, for the same 5 bucks you pay for all my shit that is there.
&gt;
&gt;Okay so please watch the special and enjoy it. 
&gt;
&gt;Lastly I'd like to apologize for all of you who have been confronted with my stupid fucking face as you go down into the subway, or buy Roling Stone Magazine, or the magazine two magazines down from Rolling Stone. Or the one next to that. 
&gt;
&gt;I'd like to write more or, but I have noodles and a chicken just finishing and my kids need to eat in front of project runway. Then I'm going to Radio City to see Donaire beat the shit out of that guy who's name begins with R., right after my special airs. 
&gt;
&gt;Thanks again for everything. 
&gt;
&gt;regards

So

Here's the skinny:

* Wedding is in Cape Hatteras on September 14th. Plenty of time to schedule.
* They rented a beach house.
* Louis is requested to officiate the wedding
* If he wants something
* Louis can bring whoever the fuck he wants. Screw the RSVP. If he wants to roll in with Dimitri Martin's mother in skimpy lingerie
* We will pay for him to get licensed to officiate. (it's super easy
* He gets a place to stay. Food provided.
* Transportation probably wont be provided by the bride and groom
* We will leave him the fuck alone if he decides he just wants to go fishing
* No press allowed
