**WHAT DO YOU PEOPLE WANT?** 

I don't know what you want. Do you want more portraits of people from the 19th century, Nagasaki Bombing, etc) photographs colorized, do you want to see more movie stars, celebrities and famous personalities in general colorized? This is your chance to speak up. As I said in the title, please upvote for visibility, and comment with what you'd like to see.

Another issue that's been bothering me is the workload. I don't know how often you guys want to see content as I feel pressed to put out a new image every day

So

Ninja-edit: You can request images by messaging the Subreddit/Any of the mods directly, also if you do request something don't just go 'I'd like to see J.F.K. in color!', actually go the extra mile and find the image you'd like to have colorized in decent quality &amp; resolution, no 150x150. :) ",,False,self,False,t3_16m8yd

the point of this whole shabang is that I am running out of people to colorize. I'm down to the last 20 historical figures that I would like to see in color, like Iwo Jima and the surrender of the empire of Japan, although it doesn't have to be WWII stuff, these are exclusively examples.

The way you can request these is P.M. me, and find the highest (I mean highest version, google search and set the standard to big sizes **only**.) resolution possible, I don't want to work with 600x800 environmental images. 

Whatever you request is up to you. Remember if you do request, even months, as I have paid comissions coming in, not that I can't handle it, but it's christmas, and also the world is ending, so I'll probably be hammered when that day rolls around. ^^I'm ^^joking ^^I ^^can't ^^drink ^^for ^^shit. ^^:(
