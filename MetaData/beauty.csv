In fact

It has come to my attention **some people would like the downvote button to return.** I haven't gotten that many complaints about the current system but I feel it is necessary to have a vote on whether or not you think it's a good idea to regulate this community with downvotes. Many of you have already figured out how to downvote posts regardless

As for **possible spam**

**EDIT 1:** Thank you guys so much for your feedback! To make people better understand the benefits of for/against downvotes

**EDIT 2:** There are two great posts I want you to consider when voting that give good reasoning for both sides of the argument.

For Downvote:

[–]kezzie87 5 points 4 hours ago (5|0)
I help moderate another sub, so we brought it back, then people complained so it was removed again.
I found the worst trolling occurred without the downvote button
I'm FOR the downvote button

Against Downvote:

[–]MichelleyMarie [+1] 2 points 9 minutes ago (2|0)
I think people tend to use it freely to downvote anything they disagree with or don't find pleasant instead of responding and adding to the discussion. For commenters like me
So those are my reasons...it is an abused tool and it can discourage open discussion.

**EDIT 3:** It seems like downvotes are in the lead by one extra person as of right now but I'm leaving this up one more day for additional votes before changing it. I'll keep downvotes on here for a week and if everyone is still happy with them we'll keep the change.

I'm not sure if you all have noticed, please message me!**

While she's been gone, sine the community has grown a lot during her absence, I feel it necessary to change some things. Wakatopatopa has been the main moderator for this subreddit up until her mysterious absence. Up until then we have made decisions together, and I have not wanted to stray too far from what we agreed upon. I have already restored the downvote button despite her wishes, but have kept the ""possible spam tag."" I have also kept the sidebar rules and description the same for the most part.

Seeing as how there is no sign of her return

Since the tag will no longer be used, is rude/offensive, or has nothing to do with this subreddit. 

This subreddit in particular is a magnet for a lot of spam for beauty products and procedures, **any posts that are ""possible spam"" will be *considered* spam unless and until the poster contacts the mods.**

I cannot put enough emphasis on this. *Contact the mods.* Be sure to check the new queue and **message the mods if you do not see your post  at least 20 minutes after submission**. When I receive a message

**For those that want to promote blogs,** I *again* strongly advise that you contact the mods. I appreciate when I am contacted rather than have this subreddit plastered with self advertisements and spam. Chances are, most of your posts are stuck in the spam filter or downvoted to oblivion anyway. Some get past and do actually get positive feedback. Rather than take those chances, contact the mods and I will try my best to work with you and see if your content is worthy. If I find your blog or product truly beneficial, we can work together and possibly set up contests for subscribers of this subreddit. This subreddit should not be filled solely with advertisements and blog promotions, but if yours seems beneficial, we can work together. **Warning: if I see that subscribers do not agree with this section of the post

Lastly

I'm so sorry this was such a long post. I know some of the things I mentioned are obvious



**TLDR; The possible spam tag will be removed. The sidebar will have an updated description. Report spam links and rude comments as much as possible. Contact mods for any and all problems: post not showing up in new queue, suggestions, etc. Comment below for any ideas for the subreddit and how to improve the look of /r/beauty.**

skin79 BB Vital Cream Triple Functions, Amazon

This ""foundation, but those are going, too.) I only need 1/4 of a full pump to cover my entire face. And when I'm tired, I do a little extra under my eyes and the bags are hidden. I chose this brand because of the coverage and the lightness. I'm pale and flawed, but I feel as though in the future I could tone back on the coverage because I only see improvement. Oh, and I don't powder either. This BB cream is good for all my face base. The best thing about all of these products I've been trying, nothing in there is really bad for your skin. They pack it full of natural goodies. Compare that to some 24-hour tube from where I'm from? Gunk in my pores before.

I just tried this. I put it on my clean face and massaged it in for a good five minutes, and pieces of peel and skin were falling off my face. Now, I have very sensitive skin, but I didn't feel pain or burning. I can't stop feeling my face. I feel like I forgot what truly naked skin felt like.

Some of it is really obviously spam, though, that sometimes you want to keep your online-professional identity separate from your say-whatever-the-hell-I-want Reddit identity, so I'm sure we've marked some legitimately good content as spam - and that's not good for the community here. 

We will be applying link flair to posts that we're unsure about

If you're one of the people posting nothing but your blog posts here, and two to let us gauge your expertise. No one's going to be turned away for not knowing everything, but just a few comments make it pretty clear whether this is something you're genuinely interested in or if you're someone being paid to SEO a blog. 

As a reminder: please keep it civil! I know I say this all the time

***now to the fun stuff!***

I'm planning some major changes on the backend to improve the looks and functionality of the sub. To that end

Here's all the details:

* The logo must a maximum of 250 pixels wide by 150 pixels high. Larger-resolution versions are welcome to help me pull colors to set backgrounds, but the image must be created to display clearly at 250 X 150. Smaller is fine, but larger is not. 

* Please send the file as .jpg or .png

* Entries are due June 1st, with the winner announced Monday, June 4th. 

* jen_wexxx and I reserve the right to disregard inappropriate submissions. We're not going to disqualify anything because we just personally don't like it, to work with you to get it to where it needs to be to be considered. 

* to enter

If you have any questions, if you don't feel comfortable asking something publicly, please message me and jen_wexxx.

I think I've found the correct subreddit for this


To start, but I need help. I'm just average in general. Not my face, I like that. But hair, clothes, etc. It's just blah to me. A lot of it has to do with body confidence, and I tend to hide as much as possible.


Some backstory. Between 9 and 16 years old I managed to gain weight until I was 210 lbs. From 16 to 19 I developed bulimia with anorexic tendancies. I dropped to 120 within the first year.  Got help, but know that at the moment that photo was taken I had just thrown a fit because I didn't want to go out because, to quote myself, ""no one needs to see someone as fat as me"".  So, even now I can't look in the mirror and trust that what I see and perceive is what's really there.  


I'm at a much healthier place now and I want to move on and be happy with how I look. 


During my recovery I gained 70lbs. That was fine, I am now down to about 150-160. I don't weigh myself, just going by what I looked like when I knew that's how much I weighed. I don't care about size or numbers, but I am uncomfortable, which is why I am happy that my body is settling into a healthier weight. 


As anyone who has recovered from an ED knows, and squats, etc. No doube chin and can see my collarbone. But I've got about 15lbs of puff just on my stomach. I can't lay down without my ribs or hips digging into the floor, but I've got three massive round rolls on my tummy. it's just comfortable. And funny. 


So far I have adjusted by just wearing dark


When I made the choice to get help I cut off all my hair. It was about boob height length, but a LOT of it. It's weird and wavy and goes frizzy and kinky at even the mention of humidity. 


So I usually straighten it


See [here](http://i.imgur.com/sZroR.jpg) . if I straighten it it looks ok and I feel much more confident, natural colour. I don't want to dye it again, I'm finally happy with my real colour.  


[Here](http://i.imgur.com/ICnJv.jpg) is me without straightening or make-up. This was a year ago


and this was a [few days ago](http://i.imgur.com/B662u.jpg). 


That fucking hat! It's a crutch.


I need tips on how to just manage myself. How do people control their hair without straightening? Since I cycle to work it's pointless straightening it, then pin it).  I have these little 2-3 inch hairs right in the centre of my hairline that drive me insane. Nothing I have done works to manage them, so they're always frizzy. 

For clothes, and hippy head bands and hair beads...That kind of thing. But I have worn nothing but black yoga pants, with a long black tank that I can pull down to cover my butt/upper thighs, then a baggy t-shirt over that, and always some sort of hoody over that...no matter how hot it is.  

I want to have that natural easy appearance. I want to look like a willowy hippy girl. I am on the inside. I feel I look too hard. 

Where should I start people of reddit?

4. let dry
5. Use neutrogena pore minimizing moisturizer
6. Exfoliate with face cloth twice a week.

There has to be something I can do. I have gotten a facial but I don't think this will really help me because the pores just fill back up with stuff in a matter of days.

I have long considered trying sulfate-free shampoo, with Shirley Temple ringlets (amusingly, only at my temples) and an annoyingly straight crown. I was previously using olive oil shampoo and conditioner from random grocery stores, chock full of sulfates, plus chi silk by the handful. My hair looked great! All I had to do was pull it back in a long braid when wet, let it dry, and voila! The only problem was breakage. I felt like my hair was breaking all the time

Now my hair is frizzier, and I hate hats). The breakage doesn't seem to be down at all, although my hair does seem to be growing faster. The most annoying side-effect is tangliness. Even though the leave-in-conditioner is supposed to be a detangler, I develop baby dreds daily. I have to comb out my hair 3-5 times a day to keep it knot-free. It looks worse, and I feel like my transition period shouldn't last a month and a half. I'm about ready to abort the mission and revert to previous habits. Has anyone else experienced this kind of failure from the sulfate-free trend? Any thoughts?

Dark circles

* Allergies

* Atopic dermatitis (eczema)

* Stress

* Smoking

* Chronic alcohol use/abuse

* Nasal congestion

* Sinus infections

* Sun exposure

* Melanoma

* Malnutrition

* Kidney deficiencies

* Unhealthy glucose levels

* Iron deficiency all the way to pernicious anemia

* Liver disease

Dark circles are also a side effect of many drugs. Again

Keep in mind that some darkness under the eyes is natural; that skin is the thinnest on the body (as thin as half a milimeter!) and very translucent. Because that skin is so delicate, don't rub - being rough can make dark circles worse, as it's easy to cause mild bruising. I like the [stippling method](http://thegloss.com/beauty/video-stippling-the-best-way-to-apply-foundation-833/), it works for concealear as well as foundation. If you do use your fingers to apply, pat it on, don't rub! And use your ring finger. Usually that is your weakest finger, so it will pat the most delicately. 

I've also seen mentioned that tanning helps fade the appearance of dark circles: this is a bad

To sum up: Dark eye circles? ***See your doctor.*** No medical cause? Drink lots of water

* I have REALLY dark and corse hair on my arms (Got to love the Italian genes) and in mass quantities. I am a bit self conscious about it, and I'm not feeling to good about that lol. Any products that you have had good luck with? Any other suggestions?
* Cuticles! My cuticles are atrocious on my toes and fingers. Just need basic help on how to keep them in control.
* Also my nails are very very weak
* I have large green/grey eyes. I have been using a light pink bare minerals glittered eye shadow most recently
* Anyone have any idea how I could bring out the shape of my eyes more as well? They have a very distinct shape that I would love to accentuate

I also posted some questions in the fancy follicles but i'll post them here as well:

* I have very fine hair [only picture I have to truely show how little hair I have](http://sphotos.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-snc6/281277_10150249896134221_533294220_7498598_654567_n.jpg) [this is from the front and that is all of it](http://a5.sphotos.ak.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ak-snc6/268704_1740018753952_1643160094_1362759_4652093_n.jpg) there are places on my head where you can see my scalp directly it is so thin
and I like to keep it long. Cutting it shorter doesn't really look the best on me. Especially anything shorter than shoulder length, there is no volume to it. It is always in my face and it sheds EVERYWHERE. Headbands have been a big thing just because it is the only thing that will actually hold it back other than a band. I just want to know if there is anything I can do with it that I am missing!?
* My hair gets very greasy
* Is there a way to condition my hair to not need to be washed everyday? I've tried
* Last

Because I have so little hair when it gets greasy it starts to get very piecey and is extremely noticeable. So any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!!

Lastly

* How often should I moisturize my body? And what is the best lotion you suggest? I have extremely sensitive skin.
* My scalp is really dry and really oily all at the same time. I have psoriasis and get little cuts on my head that flake frequently. I also have severe dandruff. However
* I also have combination skin on my face. My t-zone is a hot mess all the time and the pores are so big at this point I can swim in them? Any pore minimizers actually help? Because I am getting serious acne in this area.
* I have a ton of blackheads all over my face. They never come out when I try to remove them (even facialists have a hard time) although I drink at least 8 cups of water a day. They are causing me to have cuts all over and it is really unpleasant.
* My eyelid area is really sensitive and most facial creams are a bit too strong to handle. I have been using cortizone to keep it healthy. Any ideas?
* My lips are chapped NONSTOP. I carry chapstick with my at all times but it doesn't seem to work. 
* Cuts on my body take crazy long times to heal. As in months for a simple scratch. Any creams out there that can help them? I use neosporin
* The feet on my skin is so rough and thickens grossly overtime. I have tried everything. Ped egg
* I have had spider veins in my legs since I was about 15 (20 now). Any ideas on that to do? They kind of just look like clusters of veins that are not attached to anything.
* I need a new spot treatment. The toothpaste/benzoyl doesn't work anymore. I have been looking into Eradikate. Has anyone used this? Good reviews/bad reviews?

Of course runway is runway and not all the looks are realistic for real life. But there are some cool elements you can incorporate in your everyday wear. 

It does seem, for some reason maintaining that it is more difficult to navigate than a pencil. It really isn't. Liquid liners create a more precise result and it is much easier to get a neat line. So unless you want to go smoky, I would say liquid is the better choice. 

If you're just starting out, dark line with little effort. Wait for it to dry and then run your finger over it. The colour should not come off or flake. 

To apply, length wise, against the lid. Dab the eyeliner to the outer corner. Then start at the inner corner and dab towards the middle. Go over the line again to even it out. 

Doing a cat eye is a bit trickier. A great tip I recently heard was to shape the cat eye with a light brown eyeshadow first. That way

My hair feels pretty healthy most of the time but if I don't blow dry and straighten it before it air dries it gets these nasty frizzy ends that look like my hair is dying. I've been using Loreal's Nature Therapy for a while and it does help with how dry my hair feels but what other shampoos from my local store with help with the frizz and dryness better? Maybe Pantene ProV or Tresemme? 

I don't know if this makes a difference but I have medium length hair and it's naturally wavy. I'm caucasian so that may explain the general texture.

Thank you for any input 


UPDATE: 
Hey everyone! So thank you all for your great input. It was really helpful. A small update here, and I was blown away. My hair has been so soft and feels so moisturized (still!) it's unbelievable. I recommend the oil treatment to try at least once. AMAZING results (: the coconut oil was about $10 and it's well worth it.

I've also started drinking nothing but water and can really notice small changes in my body. I love it.

*  I'm currently in college- prime time for experimenting with potentially dumb decisions
*  I have absolutely no instinct on how to style/manage my hair when it's longer
*  It would be cheaper than regular salon haircuts.

Reasons against: 
*  I'm not sure how I'll be perceived.  I know the whole fuck what everyone thinks gag
*  The question of if I'd be taken seriously
*  I haven't had long hair in three years
*  It would also be an experience to have long hair again. 
*  My boyfriend is also eager for my hair to grow out.

Firstly

The most valuable things I gleaned from everyone's comments were that 1. Chemical sunscreens break me out, not an anti-aging product that includes spf. 

As it so happens

I made myself wait a couple of weeks before updating here, and no immediate breakouts! It actually has more of a matteifying effect on my skin. The two cysts on my chin from the last sunscreen I used have dried up, and I am happy to say that there are no new ones.

It does leave a bit of a whitish cast on my skin after applying, and he hasn't mentioned it.) I have noticed a few more blackheads/blocked pores than usual, but nothing painful, and TBH that usually happens when I use any kind of moisturizer/lotion on my face in the morning. I do have to make sure my skin is well exfoliated and moisturized before hand - I applied it one morning when I was a little flaky, and it made it more noticeable. 

I may check out some of the more high-end recs when I have the cash, and is available at the drugstore.

I've just moved into a new place and  ~~moving~~ hauling my makeup collection (it's a full crate) across has made me realise that I have far too much of, and I've finally persuaded myself to give away/bin most of it. I want to replace it with a minimal, quality collection which can be stored a slightly less anti-social manner.

So, as long as I'm getting what I pay for. If it helps, I'm pale (cool - NW15 last time I bought anything from MAC) with brown (naturally blonde/light brown) hair, living in the UK. 

What I think I need:

* Face - base, powder, blusher
* Eyes - shadow, something eyebrow related (currently I'm using Brow-Zings by Benefit)
* Lips - a few lipsticks and glosses

I'm also thinking of getting a new set of brushes so would appreciate some advice on that front too.

* First

* If you are not sure you can last the minimum 12 weeks, and has too many dry/split ends for S&amp;D to really be effective. Over all, if your hair looks and feels bad when you run your fingers through it, get the cut if you need it. 

    Here is how to search and destroy:

http://shine.yahoo.com/8-tips-improving-search-destroy-trimming-technique-175100406.html



* Protect your hair in between cuts. Here's a list of things that can cause damage:

flat irons
curling irons
blow driers [if you must
HOT shower water
excessive brushing with non boar bristle brush
brushing/combing from root to ends [it should be ends to roots]
wearing your hair in VERY tight ponytails and other **tight** styles
snags from metal accessories
over-washing your hair
Sleeping with loose hair

Obviously, but not both. You can straighten with a blow drier actually, which could be less damaging than a flat iron, or you can air dry and risk less damage with a flat iron and heat protecting spray. I personally, gave up heating my hair all together and learned to love my natural texture, which happens to be mostly straight anyway. That's actually the best option health-wise. If I want it straighter,[ I just wrap my hair](http://www.dominicanblowout.com/how_to/how-to-do-a-doobie/).  If you like to curl your hair, rags, which is better for your hair at night anyway. You can try all sorts of heatless updoes or half updos as well. If you prolong heat styling to once a week minimum



When it comes to brush damage, a widetooth wood comb, a rattail comb, and a boar bristle brush.



When it comes to showering,  use as cool/cold water as you can stand to close cuticle. This will make your hair a lot shinier and less frizzy. Try to switch to sulphate free shampoo, or if possible, [conditioner only washing](http://www.reddit.com/r/beauty/comments/rdqmm/the_basics_of_conditioner_only_washing/). Sulphates are really bad for your hair and your hair will thank you if you switch to something less harsh. Also, try to avoid silicones in your shampoo/conditioner as they tend to ""fake"" healthy hair and cause a LOT of build up. Try to prolong showers to every other day at least because the natural oils, or sebum, produced by your scalp is actually good for protecting it. To protect split ends, but don't use so much to the point you look greasy.



A good tip for the overall growth and health of your hair is to take vitamins. Try biotin, skin, and nail vitamins. Warning: biotin may cause a little breakouts if you do not drink enough water.



* Before you go to the salon, which is the average amount of hair growth per month. Do you want to grow out layers? Do you want to grow out bangs? Do you want to keep them? Do you want a style you used to have? Print a picture of the hair style you want. If it happens to be a picture of yourself with a certain style, it may even be easier. When making the appointment, tell the stylist these things over the phone to get him/her prepared. If you don't want much length off but your hair is uneven and needs to be reshaped, let him know. The more information the better. If you're not sure about layers or face framing or bangs and what not, look up what best matches your face shape, but make sure to make it clear you want to keep your length as long as possible. Plan this at least a week in advance and be sure what you ask for is what you want.

* When you go to the salon, bring your own sulphate free shampoo and have them use that on you instead. If you do conditioner only washing, tell them you want to wash your hair right before you get there and just have it rewetted. they should understand. Try not to use product before you get to the salon, since the purpose is to arrive with clean hair. 

* The stylist will ask if you want your hair blow dried. Say no. Let it air dry or put it in a braid after you leave. This may actually save you an extra 25 dollars as well at certain salons. The less damage the better. The most damage you will probably get is if they towel dry your hair. At home

* The stylist will ask how much you want taken off. Tell him you are growing your hair out and only want a trim. Tell him to trim your existing layers, tell him to take off between 1/8th of an inch to 1/4th of an inch. The maximum off should be 1/2 an inch, and that's if your hair splits up further than you thought or is drier a little further off the shaft. If it happens to be more than 1/2 an inch, get ONLY the damage cut off. I'd rather have 2 inches off than have severe split ends. Warning: stylists do tend to be scissor happy so don't be surprised if they cut off a little more than you ask for, especially since hair is cut while it's wet; wet hair stretches, so whatever is cut, it will look even shorter when it dries. 

* If you want to save salon trips only to get your hair reshaped and you  trust yourself, and will protect you from scissor-happy stylists. Be sure you can handle it though, because you'll end up with short crudely layered hair if you mess up. Remember, cut off as little at a time as you can and FOCUS. This is only for the *daring*.

I need some advice on shampoo

I blow dry my hair about 3 times a week (and then maybe straighten it) and let it air dry on the other days. It's about 3 inches past my shoulders. 

My hair is definitely greasy at the roots and has been my whole life. I figure I wash my hair about 5 times a week and use dry shampoo on the off days. On the off days I feel pretty gross cause dry shampoo just doesn't seem to do enough. 

However

I've tried lots of different shampoos-- from herbal essences to professional shampoos to sulfate and paraben free shampoos and have had varying results. Shampoos that are supposed to be super moisturizing make my ends happy and my roots sad. I think my hair has probably done best on the Organix Moroccan oil shampoo. 

For conditioner

Some ""after washing"" products work better for me than others...right now I'm using a volumizing mousse and a Moroccan oil product for the ends of my hair. 

So help me


EDIT: Thank you guys so so so much for your suggestions! The general feeling here seems to be that I should shampoo less often and only use sulfate, but I think I'll try again!

Then I apply self tanner to my face and neck. I only apply it to my face and neck because it's winter, I am on my 3rd bottle of it. Let it dry over night, wash it off in the AM. If you have hair on your upper lip, apply very sparingly, it will make it more noticeable.

There are 3 steps total

I doubt anyone really knows I've got acne issues right now, and it's been driving me NUTS! I’m 24 now and I’m pretty sure PUBERTY is over for me, so my acne should be gone too. No one has had it this long or this bad in my family and I’m just sick of dreading people seeing my face without any cover-up on.

(WHO DECIDED

I've tried every ""drug store"" option I could find, EFT, Healing Code, and exercise. I've done everything I can think of, and my last effort was the dreaded, and seeming inevitable Proactiv. Well, I can't say I've had the best experience with it so far. It's downright depressing actually because I've fought so hard to get rid of it, which is WAY more than I could say half a year ago… But that’s another story entirely.

I used proactiv exactly as instructed for about one and a half months now, itchy, red skin. It slightly got better for about 2 days before getting worse, but it usually does that between those “times of the month"", so I can't say it's all that much of a surprise or even related to my using this stuff.

The worst part of it so far is when I use the ""Step 3 - Benzol Peroxide"" stuff on my face and it stings for the next hour or so. Allergic reaction much? I don't know for sure

To say I'm disappointed is understating it. I will be returning the product for a refund

What is a live exchange?

A live exchange is a place where you can bring all of your new and gently used beauty products and swap for things you actually want. Bought a foundation in the wrong color? Shirt a size too big? Conditioner too heavy for your hair? Polish too cool for your skintone? Swap it! These exchanges are mainly done online through websites such as MakeupAlley

We've also created a subreddit devoted to planning such events. Check it out! http://www.reddit.com/r/beautymeetup/

Avoid hot water – Even though taking extended hot showers seems like a good idea when the mornings are frigid


Use sunscreen – If you are spending any time outside during the winter months your skin can experience burning from a combination of sun and wind. Use a sunscreen with plenty of moisturizing ingredients like shea butter to help act as a barrier from the elements. Don't forget that your hair needs protection too



Exfoliate – Using a gentle exfoliator a few times a week will help remove dry patches on the face and body while helping the skin absorb serums and moisturizers more readily. Try a microfiber cloth like the ones from Nufolia which can be used everyday if needed.



Amp up your moisturizer- Now is the time to switch to a heavier



Use a humidifier – Indoor heating, use a humidifier while you sleep to put the lost moisture back in your skin.

Wear lipstick – Exfoliate lips and apply a lip balm before bed. Then reapply lip balm in the morning before applying lipstick. I love Dianne Brill because it’s loaded with vitamins and doesn’t feel dry on the lips.Whatever you do not wear long lasting formulas during dry winter months as they are actually formulated to dry the lips.

The plates don't touch apart from at the very end when cold
To get them to touch enough to straighten a thin section of hair you have to clamp really hard

It only works with big sections of hair which doesn't straighten properly.

2. What can I do to make my skin less oily?

Edit 2: 4. Do you think it's good to go for moisturizers and all that ""for men""? Like the ones Nivea has with ""Men"" written on it? Or is that just a marketing gimmick?
