To preface this

Here's my thought, I am the iron man suit"". I think that the Avengers 2 will have this subplot with Bruce and Tony working together and they'll both work together to get back into battle. I don't think we'll see the Hulk in either of the next 3 avengers movies (Thor 2, Captain America 2, Guardians of the Galaxy) in phase 2. 

That's just my theory

Oh a small question

edit: To add to this, be coerced back into battle? I think that Tony will up his game figuratively speaking and this will happen. I think Bruce and Tony can learn a lot from each other and showed absolute great chemistry together in the Avengers. It'd be great to build on that in the Avengers 2.",,False,self,t5_2sb1u,1367697144.0,ironman,

* ""That man is playing Galaga""
* The 6 heroes fighting off the ""metal monsters"" as I call them
