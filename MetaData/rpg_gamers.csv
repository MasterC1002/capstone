Finally, which are probably some of the best I've ever seen in an RPG.

* Shadow's [suicide after the final battle](/spoiler) in FF VI. [And no, and just staying in Kefka's collapsing tower.](/spoiler) I actually felt like crying and was depressed for the rest of the weekend.

* same goes for the ending movies of Secret of Mana and Lufia II

* Valkyrie Profile (the first part); The whole story about Celia, Grey and Lemia. The time everything came to an end during Grey's recruiting scene, my mum got into my room only to find a sobbing little kid in front of the TV. In hindsight I would rather she caught me watching porn.

* The Ending of Valkyrie Profile: Covenant of the Plume. [I had used the plume too often and got the C ending. I was angry to no end to have fallen to Hel's trickery. I actually got into a physical fight with an acquaintance over an unrelated issue

* Ok this seems very nerdy but in Dragon Age Origins [my character, and I felt guilty for a few days and ever since every time I think about it. This feeling did not get better while playing Awakening.](/spoiler)

I have trolled through the archives of RPG maker games

My cousin always thought I was crazy.. I mean my favorite part of the game was the part that seemed to be the most boring to people.  Am I just crazy? Or are there others that for some strange reason LOVE to level up

Like in FF9 right when you hit those dragons for the first time, In FF7 I grinded 2 Master Materias for every character (2 Command, 2 Magic, etc.). To the point that I would have it so a normal attack would hit like 5 times, heal my HP and MP entirely and other cool combos using all of my materias to their full potentials.

My cousin has always been the one other person I know that enjoys RPG's as much as me

Am I the only one..? One of the few? Am I the 1%?

**EDIT**: Wow.. 24 upvotes and 0 downvotes.. Even those of you who think I'm weird don't downvote.. This community is great

---

**EDIT 2**: It sounds like the majority of you guys are recommending the Disgaea series which I haven't really looked into much.  I have normally been turned away from Strategy RPG's like Final Fantasy Tactics though.  Never really enjoyed turn based RPG's but I guess I could give this series a shot.  If any of you can recommend some other games it would be greatly appreciated.

---

Just keep in mind:

* I LOVE level grinding
* Not a BIG fan of strategy RPG's (turn based)
* Will not turn away a game that has a goofy/stupid storyline (as gameplay/lvling up is more important to me)
* Will **NOT** play any type of **MMORP** like WoW
* Currently play DotA and DOTA 2 as my main game (I like that it has RPG characteristics but also fast paced, I am looking for a bored at home fun RPG that I can just play when I have some time here and there)

Top favorite games are:

    1. Final Fantasy Series

    2. Chrono Trigger

    3. Breath of Fire Series

    4. Earthbound Series

*Pretty much any other older game that has the same basic style as these.  Haven't really played any recent RPG's as I feel like they are just going for crazy graphics which is not something that I really even like.. I am more of an older style RPG player*

We (the mods) have talked about this in private but we want to see what you guys think before making any sort of decision.  And this isn't a black/white issue - do we only allow posts talking about Kickstarters but not linking directly to the page?  Maybe we just stay vigilant to look for gaming of the subreddit and block offending users only?  Or do we leave everything as is.  Let us know what you think.

(just the name would suffice)

The game I played was around more than 8 years back when you bought game cds and they came with lots of demos and games.

The game was like this:

* The game has similar mechanics to Dungeon and dragon board game. Its is a rpg elements with dice. The ingame view is as of heroes of might and magic 3 or disciples 2.

* You can hire mercenaries or heroes (not sure) from village or town.

* When you battle monsters in dungeons 

* **DICE ROLL** and the old style graphics were what distinguishes it from other games.

Ive been looking for this game for long time and any help will be appreciated. (Ive tried Gamespot/IGN and other mumbo jumbo formus 

The graphics are similar to Heroes of might and magic 3 and I used to play games like Dink smallwood when I played this.

The map is somewhat like this but I think better than this ...
http://image.gamespotcdn.net/gamespot/images/screenshots/gs/strategy/herochron/herochron_790screen003.jpg

* ITs a PC windows game
* We donot have a full army but few heroes or maybe one at a time.
* we travel over map to locations by clicking to a location with mouse and hero comes ther (not sure if this was controlled by dice).
* D&amp;D board games relate so much with the game.
I can also remember some dice from these in the game https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Dice_(typical_role_playing_game_dice).jpg

I seem to be getting stuck. Not a lot is explained or maybe I'm just really bad at it.. There doesn't seem to be a map yet although there are signs. Items/equipment in shops aren't given descriptions. It isn't really explained how to use magic. I know older games can be like this

* He talks about how remaking a game faithful to the original would be too boring and stifle his creativity bla bla bla. Thing is

* I'd probably be in the minority here, new and interesting perspective and take on a universe so familiar to us. *However,* if and only if this is done at the hands of a competent team.

I'm looking for a new RPG and I was wondering if there are some good medieval open world RPGs. I can only think about TES but I'm looking for something else that tells a better story (though still open world. I want to explore). 

I could think of the Gothic series and I think Risen is also open world. What about Neverwinter nights 2? I haven't played that yet but I don't know if it is what I'm looking for. What about Two Worlds II?

Also

Thanks.

1361469052.0,18yr94,"A few days ago, I asked for advice on how to get past a freezing bug in Grandia on my PSP. Here's a short explanation on how to transfer saves from the PSP Go to ePSXe and vice-versa.",hairybalkan,36,5,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/18yr94/a_few_days_ago_i_asked_for_advice_on_how_to_get/, maybe even write up a general guide.

First of all

* PSP\SAVEDATA\SCUS94457

It depends on the game ID

* SCEVMC0.VMP
* SCEVMC1.VMP

I downloaded [MemCardRex 1.6](http://shendosoft.blogspot.com/2012/07/memcardrex-16-released.html), then copy the required save block from one to the other and save the file. The two ePSXe memory cards are located in the **memcards** folder of the emulator folder and are called

* epsxe000.mcr
* epsxe001.mcr

If they aren't there

With that, and prefer it portable, you'll probably want to also transfer the save back to the PSP. Sadly, MemCardRex doesn't support saving to the PSP format, only reading from it. If you have a PS3, you can save to that format and then transfer the save to your PSP, I think that's possible. However

What I did was to install the CWCheat plugin. For that, the plugin didn't work for me, so I had to find a specific version of the plugin. Here's both versions:

* [CW Cheat Official 2.3](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?4vcbzp42dotgaob) - Didn't work for my Go
* [CW Cheat PSP Go 2.3](http://www.mediafire.com/download.php?s93cc212x133ab4) - This one worked for me

I got my ePSXe memory card file (extension .mcr) and copied it to my PSPGo in the folder

* seplugins/cwcheat/mc

I then renamed it to 

* SCUS_94457-0

And also made a copy called

* SCUS94457-0

I'm not sure which of this is the proper naming scheme, you need to name it after that other game's ID.

Once I got it all ready, I picked ""manage memory cards"" and then loaded up my card file for import. It only took a second and I was able to load up my ePSXe game from my PSP. When I loaded it up, i immediately went back to the save point and saved again, just in case, but I'm not sure if that's necessary.

Also, probably not very useful screenshots with parts of the process.

Fast forward years, and have tried quite a few of the newer ones that people recommend, and frankly, I can't fucking stand the plots of most of them.  

Eternal Sonata

Lost Odyssey wasn't horrible, and I gave up the game when you get to the second act and the giant boobed girl falling out of her dress for no reason shows up (I think she was a queen or something). (To be fair, the story parts that talked about his life were moving and incredible...Why couldn't the game be more like that?)

And Oh my God, a few hours in, the fourth time what's his ass yells ""I'm the HERO!"" I wanted to cut out my fucking brain to forget the melodramatic retardation I'd just seen. :(

Maybe this ties into the anime mindset that a lot of JRPG's have these days?   I've tried watching a lot of anime, can't think of a better one) that it's just stupid.  There ARE some good ones, and some I've loved, so don't jump up my butt about it...Just saying that the average anime I've seen is really over the top and bombastic and even the serious ones just lack plot subtlty.  Is this why today's JRPG's are like this?

So, serious, hell even funny JRPGS.  I love the combat, the upgrade systems, everything about them, but the plots of the ones I've played have been terrible and I don't know where to turn.  I'm interested in the ""Tales of"" series, but I don't want to get burned again before I get some opinions.  I want something with the adult nature and complexity of FF3 without some douchebag yelling about being THE HERO! over and over.  lol

Eathbound
Super Mario RPG

Grandia

Wild arms (didn't like the 2nd but I hear everyone else does).
Thousand Arms
Azure Dream

I was born in the 80's and i loved games like, FFVII, Seiken Denetsu 3, Chrono trigger. Those old school games is something i have played to death so im looking for games outside of SNES and PSX.

I own no last gen consoles

Don't forget the story...It should be good, the horrendous writing and plot is very off putting in many of these.

So is there a new game, is there something on the horizon for us that liked non-dumbed down RPGs from 80'-90's?

And please. I am not out to flame anyone that may like what i do not like. Nor am i saying

New RPG-element-like-games i liked: Fallout 3

But please, turn based(which possible can be turned off, like in some FFs) with a party and random encouters games  if possible. But im open to suggestions.

I need some help trying to figure out what to play because I've seen so many recommendations that I'm not sure which would be good for me so here's more info on my tastes than you're probably looking for:

My favorites are DQ8

I love good combat systems, big worlds, grinding, and mostly dungeon crawling.   Things that aren't important to me surprisingly are story and music.  I'll pick up a good book if I wanted to spend my entire game reading lore, background, etc. admittedly in dq8 and NNK, I did get sucked into the story and music despite not usually paying attention. Maybe I would like other level 5 games like white knight chronical?

People say persona is the greatest but I don't really want to relive high school in a game. I tend to eliminate games quickly due to aspects like that but realized after NNK

I've played all the skyrims

I've got pretty much every system and have looked at all the recommendations from the community (xenoblade/tales/star ocean and on and on)  My problem is I'm not sure which are recommended for great story and music

Some additional past gaming info.  Played and liked all the FF stuff, haven't played the whitcher series.

I could never get into the fallout/mass effect type series either. Guess I prefer the non future/scifi RPGs. Also don't really like srpg games either.  Doesn't matter if its turn based or not but slightly prefer it.

Thanks again and sorry for the length. I just wanted to be as specific as possible about my tastes. ",self,t5_2su0w,1362196407.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/rpg_gamers/comments/19ho5o/rpg_overload_need_help/

To start off I'll jump right into one of my favorites in recent memory, the battle system was amazing and brutally difficult and unforgiving. Are there any Saga Frontier or Romancing Saga fans out there? Well this one was developed by the same team within Square that did those titles and you can see it in skill and stat progression. One of my biggest irritations with the game was how it discouraged grinding, while it may be dull to some I have always gotten a euphoric rush from killing some monsters and leveling up a good bit to even the odds on an upcoming boss. In this title the monsters grow with you so you can forget about that, but it always presents for a good challenge I suppose. I look forward to everyone's thoughts and happy Friday!

Since the advent of HD gaming I've wanted to see a Final Fantasy 7 remake. Especially after the FF7 Tech Demo released by Squenix. If I had the resources and time I think I could make a reasonable remake which highlights the greatest and best features of all Final Fantasies.

The Story would obviously remain the same. with a few side things thrown in to make things a little more interesting. A longer timeline including multiple sections of each characters life

Combat would be revamped for the HD generation. I know everyone laments over 13's Battle system. But I think given some greater strategic tweaks and being able to include the entire party like from 10 would make the battles varied

Game Tie-ins. I think that some tie-ins for other FF spin-offs would be appropriate. Like At what point in Clouds life did he travel back to the world of Ivalice to fight alongside Ramza? Or at what point did Cloud and Co. make that magical universe jump to the Kingdom Hearts universe? and Yadda yadda yadda.

I think ALL weapons and armor should be cosmetic

And this is all I have so far. If anyone would like to contribute with ideas they'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks guys!

EDIT: Thanks alot for the posts guys! They were very insightful. I think ALL of us Final Fantasy nerds would benefit from an upgraded remake for all of our favorite final fantasies. One thing that I would love to see would be an entire collection up to twelve to be released for one of the HD systems. I would gladly pay $150 for 1 through 12 plus spin offs in a single collection.

the game is split into multiple stages accessible from an overworld, and all have a different boss as the end. After beating the boss you will have a choice of several rewards ranging from equip recipes, to ingredients for recipes, to artifacts which permanently increase a stat (the only way to increase your stats). The quality of the rewards are also influenced by how many bonus points you collected during the stage, with random criteria selected such as number of monsters defeated, chests opened, money collected

the game doesn't feature much character customization. You choose a ""race"" at the beginning of the game which determines your base stats and proficiency with casting magic (the melee class has shorter cast range and longer cast time than the mage class)

Exit Fate is the one I have just started, magic is shared between all characters and has limited uses based on how many of the 'item' you buy, but never runs out), but they clearly spent a lot of time and effort doing portraits for all the characters, and the rather large battle sprites. The only thing thats irking me so far is its clear they took art assets right from the PS1 Suikoden series (easily noticeable in the towns). You can find it here: http://site.scfworks.com/?page_id=10

I Miss the Sunrise is a whole 'nother ballgame. Its a futuristic RPG where all the battles are based between spaceships. The combat system makes or breaks the game for you, Pilot), all at 1000, and if any are reduced to 0 the ship is destroyed. At the same time, every time you use a weapon, you use a bit of one of those HPs, depending on the weapon. You spend a lot of time crafting parts together to make weapons to cover a variety of damage types, there's a lot of time spent on the backstory and making the world make logical sense.

I have a few questions that I would like answered.

First off, but has a serious, and sometimes dark, story and deep character development. Would this hurt the overall feel of the game, or would it be a welcome change of pace? How do you feel about it?

In games such as Skyrim and Fallout you start off with a blank slate. This is great for roleplaying but sometimes at the expense of main character development. Would you rather play a pre-written character or start with a blank slate?

At what point in time is it best to start the main characters journey? How much back story should be known and how much up for interpretation?

Party based or lone wolf? Open world

Sometimes Open world games make you feel like the only important and likable character (Oblivion and Morrowind are two possible examples). Would a heavy reliance on supporting cast be important or is it all about the player?

What is your ideal class system? How much should it effect gameplay? Should it be based on stats or the player's skill?

How much gore is too much?

Please feel free to add anything else. In the future I'll make a post when I have some art assets and stories and such based on my fantasy setting. (I do have work on it if you are interested).

The whole world seemed extremely plain and unvaried. The story was too typically fantasy-like

Then, I have only just left the torture chambers and am now in the Promenade. One of the big things that I missed from PS:T, that was partially added to BG2, was the description of the environments in text form. This is going to sound cheesy, but no matter how detailed and artistic the visuals are in a game, nothing will beat how it looks in my head. Also, actually giving some characters depth is a big step up. Yet, BG2 is still nothing special when comparing to PS:T.

So, what games are similar (similar in terms of the aforementioned gripes about the BG games) to PS:T? I have tried googling and have come up with Fallout, Arcanum and Neverwinter Nights: Mask of the Betrayer. Am I correct in that those games have a similar style to PS:T? Was I just wrongly recommended these games previously when I wanted to know what games were similar to PS:T?

Here are some details that might be useful:

- My favorite RPG's of all time are definitely Chrono Cross, X, and 12.

- I'm a massive fan of Chrono Cross, and running around the map. The pacing of the game also felt great because you wouldn't have to waste a bunch of time leveling up and trying to equal out your party members. Are there any games like this besides CC?

- Also, but I actually bought it a few years ago, got halfway and couldn't finish it. Cooke and Mack were two the most annoying video game characters I had ever experienced, and I had a really hard time caring about the rest of the characters. Everything felt really forced. I was really disappointed.

- I'm not opposed to battle mechanics that are similar to FF12. It's not my first choice

- The story is probably the most important thing for me. I will put up with somewhat frustrating game mechanics if the story is engaging enough.

- I'm definitely a huge fan of PS1 era games as well

- I have a 360
