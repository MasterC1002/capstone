1368093669.0,1dzr7d,Today I saved a life,CMFW,533,77,45,"Hey Reddit

I don't even know what subreddit to put this in....

I've been a paramedic now for 6 years or so. I don't really remember what year I became one. I want to share with you a story. I'm a volunteer paramedic. I make $0/hr.

Today, an EMT and myself,) we were told the patient had no pulse and was cold to the touch. Normally, this means they're dead and I expect to pronounce dead on scene.

We arrive on scene to find a deputy who has informed us he has already called the morgue. Well

The deputy felt differently and shouted at me that I was wrong and that the morgue have already been called. Fuck him.

We placed the patient on our backboard with compressions already started. I failed at obtaining an IV in the house. We place a King Airway (an airway that is blind insertion and will almost always get proper placement) and it failed. My team and I bring the patient to the squad and there I initiate an IO. (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL3DMY1Zln0) I don't know how to make words hyperlinks.... sorry.

That was successful and I push a round of Epi (adrenaline) into his bone and we continued CPR. I had the experienced EMT drive and the rookie EMT in the back with me. (we all need to learn somehow!)

While en route I tried to place an Endotracheal Tube aka ETT (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J3J38se3TQ&amp;amp;NR=1&amp;amp;feature=fvwp) but was unable to, the patient was breathing on his own. FUCK YEA! I had the rookie stop CPR so I could analyze the rhythm. VFib. I'm gonna shock the shit out of him. Before I could, he flat-lined again. Damn! We got to the ER and there they were able to ETT him and you know what?

We all got a pulse back. I found out later that his outcome is looking really really good and that he is expected to leave the hospital in great condition. 

I want to share with you my happiness for saving a life and that someday

Edit: Thanks guys for all of the feedback!! And thanks for the gold! Never got Reddit Gold before!! One of the gals in the ER is also a drinking buddy of mine

Edit 2: There were some questions about me pronouncing dead in the field. That's just the term we use

After he said that she gave him a dollar and started talking about how awesome it was to meet another redditor at Six Flags. After all that I came up with an clever idea. After someone gets the dollar each person would tally one line on the bottom of it and ask more people when a narwhal bacons and pass it on and see where it goes from there by exchanging numbers. Also we were thinking about drawing the reddit alien on the dollar somewhere. What do you think? TL;DR? I met a redditor at Six Flags and created a cool new way to find local redditors.
