Amazon.com has apparently changed their shipping rates for certain items (DVDs being one of them).

You can see the info in the fine print [HERE](http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=1161252).

DVD/Blu-Ray shipping has gone from $2.99 to $3.99. I personally see this as a **huge** reason to join [Amazon Prime](http://www.amazon.com/gp/prime). I personally had been questioning whether renewing was worth it... Well that answers that.

First of all

I have given around 150 gifts here. I tried to count just not in my amazon history because I went nuts a while ago and deleted a ton of my post history on reddit. Oh well. Anyway I gave up because there were like 25 pages of orders and I gift in other subs so it was confusing. 

Sorry I'm rambling. POINT BEING: I like to give presents! 

[Here was my intro post!](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/xw82b/intro_just_what_i_was_looking_for/) 

Everyone was so nice to me. I know that's not a ton of comments by today's standards here

I'm rambling again... Sorry caffeine.

1360292505.0,183x0q,"[PSA] The rumor of our demise into ""power hungry"" beasts has been greatly exaggerated.",VKilledTInternet,124,11,509,"So the rumor mill has been running rampant around these parts. lolinternetdrama amirite?

Well I'm doing this PSA to clear the air of what REALLY happened with some recent crap.

Note: Normally we do our job well enough that we do NOT have to divulge this information to other users. 95% of the time we remove things/message people about it and it's done. We've just been seeing a lot of malarkey around and decided as a team to come to the community about this current issue.

/u/thedarkestone1had been posting more discussions which could be seen as ""b'awww"" which I've seen as a whole on this sub we're pretty much against and sick of. Did I mention it's in the rules that you shouldn't do that? Well, I so wanted to win."" 

This kind of behavior was bordering on begging and when you put all of that together

/u/Blissfully however


Alright to get back to your question:

&gt;Her post was fine except for the part specifying that she wanted ""Pictures

&gt;For example ""Check out my tits in these lingere

&gt;That kind of comment in this case didn't happen (Thank god) but the line is what got the post removed.

&gt;That's all. Removed.

&gt;Then

Apparently this one stormed off in a huff and used another user to dodge the ban. We're debating on further action to take on this one. 

So a small reminder of rules 

* We are a ""Family Sub"" because we do NOT have a limit on under 18 folks. If this becomes an issue later it will be addressed.

* NSFW stuff is perfectly fine. Just as long as it's not photographs/videos of YOU and/or subtle begging to go along with it. .gifs, as long as they're labeled with that lovely NSFW tag. Report a thread that should be NSFW please.

* tl;dr: when the mods ask you to stop doing something

And some personal suggestions from me about this whole ""cliquish"" shit.

* If you see someone gifted ""too much"" you're doing it wrong. It's not about comparing the amount of trash you produce via amazon packaging to the next person on this sub. We're not forcing people to get gifted. 

* Don't like what someone is posting? Think they are doing it to get gifted? Don't gift them. Simple as that

* If you're feeling that the ""same few people"" are being gifted

1369742092.0,1f703o,[Contest] For everyone. A contest to put RAOA back on track,CampBenCh,122,13,679,"Disclaimer- this is all from my phone so sorry for things like typos and formatting. 


Sorry for a short rant/intro to this contest 

Here's the deal. I LOVED the secrets thread (and even the secret crush one)

Here's the problem: people feel ignored, everyone else has friends on here, there's ""cliques"", etc. 

Solution- bring people together. 

But how? By having a contest. Some people are motivated by gifts so this will help. For this who ""don't want to be gifted"" STFU for this contest. This sub was founded on gifting so ill gift you if you win dammit! This sub is now about community

So what is the contest? Lets go over it now (pull up a chair). 

We are all now going to meet new people. I want EVERYONE who reads this to participate. Even you mods. 

You might be saying

Glad you asked. Here's what to do: go to the random wish list button and hit it once. If you have NEVER spoken or interacted with this user

Next

Once you have your screenshot

That's it. Simply get to know someone you've never talked to before on here and you may win! You can enter up to 5 times!! Of course you can do this more than 5 time but only 5 will count as an entry. 

Contest will end in two nights since I should still be on casing break and I can have time to try and gift. Ill say ~~Thursday~~ WEDNESDAY/Thursday night at ~~8pm-ish~~ 2am Central time (I had to change to make sure I can gift then. It will be THURSDAY at 2am (my Wednesday overnight shift if that makes sense).). 

I saved this for last in hopes anyone looking for an easy contest to just get gifts are scared away. There will be three winners. Prize 1 will be random. This winner will get something $50-100 off their wish list. You cannot tell me what you want- you shouldn't enter to win a gift, had the best questions to ask etc). This winner will get something for $25-35 off their wish list. The last winner will be gifted Reddit Gold. I haven't thought of anything cool to judge on, so ill just do it random. 

So

I hope to see a lot of entrants and a lot of new friends! So go out there and do it. ",self,t5_2tx47,1369806049.0,linkflair contest,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/comments/1f703o/contest_for_everyone_a_contest_to_put_raoa_back/

We are allowing group gifting from now on.

**Two ways to do a group gift**

1. Sending all the funds directly to the giftee.
2. Collect all the funds on one account and purchase the agreed upon gift.

**Please note a few things regarding this change.**

1. Practicing safe group gifting 
 * A smart way to collect money is via paypal or gift cards. Note: If you do paypal someone has to withdraw the money into their bank account to pay. Paypal doesn't work with amazon.
 * Message the mods with the plans of the gift.
 * Report any sketchy behavior immediately.
 * If you are the collector

2. Stipulations
 * Do not post asking for donations/participation. This is considered begging.
 * Do not go around sending unsolicited pms for donations/participation. This is also considered begging. 
 * Although the mods will ban any user abusing group gifting
 * Take caution as this is all at your OWN risk.

3. Important factors if risky factors are involved
 * If you are caught not purchasing the gift agreed upon by your contributors
 * If you are caught collecting extra money for a gift and not returning it to the one who gave it to you

You can find it [here!](http://n8fq.org/wishlistquery2.php) Or in the sidebar.

**How to use it**

* Username: If you're looking for a specific user
* Keywords: Enter something you want to search for. If, enter ""doctor who"". Note that it's pretty primitive at the moment, you can't enter a list of words and find items that match all or any of them, just a single phrase to match.
* Price: Enter a minimum and maximum price range. Note that this is ALWAYS in US Dollars - it converts UK/CA/DE/etc prices to USD. The default minimum is 16 cents - that filters out out-of-stock items (which show up as $0.00) and Amazon gift cards (which show up as $0.15).
* Include users active in last *x* days: Restricts the search to users who have posted on RAoA in the time you specify.
* Include only lists with a shipping address: Skips lists that can't be gifted to because the user didn't enter their shipping address.
* Include only users who have gifted: Selects only users who have posted at least one [Gifted] thread on RAoA.
* Include NSFW lists: Shows results from lists with ""NSFW"" in the title

Items on the to-do list include ~~improving the list of users who have gifted (this uses the same data as the feature I added to the RWG a few days ago,False,self,t5_2tx47,1367541455.0,linkflair psa,,t3_1dglgu

Can you believe tomorrow will be my **2 month** anniversary at RAoA?! Insane. And in those 2 short months

So I figured since a kind of epic number of gifting and my anniversary would fall on the same day - why not gift someone something amazing? Something they'd use

Rules are simple:

* Put [the $69 Kindle](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Ereader-ebook-reader/dp/B007HCCNJU/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366305954&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=kindle) on your WL if it already isn't. Sorry everyone - I can't afford to gift a Kindle Fire! :/

* Tell me why you'd love to have one.

* Use the word **Kindle** somewhere in your post so I can use Reddit Raffle.

That's it! Simple. I want to pay it forward and give someone something amazing that I was also previously gifted &lt;3 Now go!

When making a discussion thread please search to make sure that another one on the same subject hasn't been posted within the past **24 hours**. If we notice a thread has been posted within that time with the same subject

Although we do understand the sub's topics do move rather quickly

**In regards to savings threads specifically**

* **Discussions**: When posting a thread or in a thread there is a difference between ""I have been saving for ####"" and ""I have a gift card fund for ####"". The former is the one that is okay to use. However any posts regarding ""gift card funds"" will be removed because of Rule #1.

* **Thanks**: When posting a thanks thread when receiving a gift card

*You open the brochure to find a large map of the grounds and find a few familiar landmarks. There’s the BGO Bulge, The TurnTable Terrace, The Gaming Arena, The Wabble/Webopoly Pavillion, and of course Cards Against Humanity Plaza. Besides the normal beaches, and other various natural landmarks there are 4 distinct camp areas, spread to the winds. These camps don’t have names oddly. Only Numbers. 1-4. You flip over the brochure to the “Introduction” page. Here’s what it says.*

This is a ""Hogwarts House Cup"" style challenge that will pit you against other RAoAers. The goal is to earn as many points as you can for your team by participating in official activities. There will be challenges each day/week. Also other achievements you will be able to earn throughout the entire competition!

* **How this works**

Once you are assigned to a team, you’ll garner even more points and don’t think because the lights are off the stage you’re not being watched. Official Referees will be paying attention to people as they are allowed to give away points to opposing teams when they catch you Randomly Being Awesome :). Also you have a chance to nominate some Random Acts of Awesome

On June 30th

We are taking Volunteers for the Referee positions. You will be a neutral party in this war between camps. Your service will be recognized alongside the champions

I really tried to gift everyone that has ever gifted me.. But I'm tight on money and I can't work at all. I finally got my shitty tax return and wanted to give something back. I hope you all enjoy your items and I loves you all &lt;3

A bit about the people I gifted..

Kaemii - You know why I gifted you. I swear you mean more than anything to me at this point and I can't wait to come see you. &lt;3

Acefredfred - Because you gifted me with both laughter and a laser pointer. I love you man. &lt;3

Kalanz - You gifted me a kindle and made me cry on cam with errbody laughing. You truly deserve so much for being so generous. I wish I could gift you more but I really can't and I hate that. Thanks for being awesome and your generosity will never go unnoticed on here. &lt;3 you man. 

MacyBelle - You gave me the experience of trying some fucking-amazing japanese candy and it was SOOOO GOOD! I value our friendship very much and I wish you the best in Hawaii. Thanks for being a great person to me and everyone else on the sub. &lt;3

Glitterpewbz - Ah..the southern sensation. You're pretty fantastic and I feel like we don't get to talk much anymore. You're usually on tinychat but always busy with the baby

BlackDeath87 - You're a pretty fantastic dude. I'm glad I met you and I appreciate the guidance on the philosophical studies. I've been checking it out a bit.. especially now that I have a kindle. Definitely going to read more now. Thanks for being great to us all

CowardlyLobster - I appreciate you gifting me on my birthday. I don't get to see much of you on here

Thisisbeethoven - Mah_Nigga.jpg

JimCarreysCorpse - MY HOBRO! You know what's up and I thank you for that. I can't thank you enough for the sloth plush. I seriously sleep with that mofo every night. Thanks for being gangster as fuck

I also gifted someone else an MP3 but I totally forgot to make a note of the name. So I hope who ever you are

There's a bunch of other people I wish I could have gifted.. Specifically everyone that has been nice to me, made me laugh, or just been there to help out. I appreciate everything you have done on this sub guys and I can't wait to start working again so I can begin gifting every week. 

Thanks for reading the wall of text. Love you all &lt;3

Self-gifted threads are not permitted. This means you cannot post a [Gifted] thread for yourself. Along those same lines

The reason for this is because a [Gifted] thread is meant to tell the person you gifted that a surprise is headed their way. That is its purpose. So posting one for yourself makes no sense (as does posting one for someone not in the community). It just doesn't belong.

I will be getting into LA on Thursday if anyone was wondering. I will be sending out a PM to everyone soon with my contact info and things of that nature.

------------
THE SCHEDULE:

**Friday:** Night- meet up at a bar or someplace social. I have no idea of the bars around, and BJ's. The responses to the questionnaire were inconclusive. 

**Saturday:** The California Science center opens at 10 A.M., reserve tickets early for Endeavor only for the 11:00 time slot. http://www.californiasciencecenter.org/GenInfo/PlanningYourVisit/Hours/endeavour/endeavour.php After our visit, to the Science Center, we'll head to lunch, location yet to be decided, but we could do anything- IN N OUT was suggested. After lunch, we're headed to the Getty center http://www.getty.edu/visit/ Free admission, on how much time we spend here

**SUNDAY:** Disneyland! If people aren't up for Disneyland we will split up into groups. I will need to know how many people are going to Disneyland... I have connections and can get 3 people (including myself) in for free. If more than 3 people want to go to Disneyland then we will split the cost of tickets between everyone. Please note you need cash to do this. If you wanna write me a check I can do that- just let me know so I can get a bunch of cash. 


-------------

So be on the lookout for a PM about this if you have said you want to go. If you do not get a PM today and want to go

If you are going and **have suggestions** about anything about this, etc. aren't known to me. 


------------

**EDIT:** I ~~am sending~~ have sent out PM's ~~right now~~.  If you wanna attend and did not get one you must let me know ASAP.

Also- if you need a ride or can drive people let me know! I should be able to drive 4 people if they need it with the rental car I got.

1364915987.0,1bip24,[PSA] A Review of Etiquette &amp; Posting on RAoA,MeghanAM,79,9,153,"Hey guys! Very exciting to see us having passed 10

We would like this opportunity to review with new and old members alike some of the finer points of etiquette on our sub.  It is important to us to maintain a friendly and welcoming atmosphere

1. If a post breaks the rules, it never hurts).  Please *do not* scold the person or make fun of them, even if they have done something that is a clear breach of our rules.  Some members have started off badly here as a result of misunderstanding what we are about and still gone on to be great, productive members.  

2. If you have a problem with a contest or gifted post (or any post, as long as it follows the [few contest rules](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/wiki/faq#wiki_contests) outlined in the FAQ.  If you personally do not like the contest, simply refrain from entering -- there are plenty of other contests around here all the time!

3. Assume good intent from community members.  We all occasionally say something that comes across in a way that we do not mean.  If a person seems to be violating rule 3, safer space to voice your opinions.  Help us keep it that way!

Thanks for reading

So I get home, intent on taking a nap since my eyes are *still* burning from something my brother had in his house yesterday when I was there for the Super Bowl.

And what the heck is on my porch...there is a [HUGE BOX](http://i.imgur.com/NsyAX6X.jpg) propped up against my door from UPS, though not out loud since that is slightly crazy.  So I open the door, kick back the cats who think that outside would be a nice place to visit, and pull the box inside.  I grab my trusty scissors to cut away at the tape and...


[HOLY SHIT](http://i.imgur.com/bUPCrmH.jpg?1).  THIS CANNOT BE REAL.  NO FREAKIN' WAY IS THIS REAL.  But as I excited remove the box and cut away at even more tape around the generous styrofoam wrapping...I discover that it IS real.

[Pictures cannot do this thing justice, but I haven't gotten around to hanging it up yet.  I am currently too busy staring in awe at this thing and wondering how on earth I got so lucky as to receive it.  Mean, it's *Narsil*, the sword that defeated Sauron.  *This kind of thing does not happen to me.*

**A pervasive, and we should all take note.**  Here's a link to the [breaking news](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12fqi6/announcement_those_of_you_that_polished/) and here's a follow-up link to give you an idea of how [widespread this scam was](http://www.reddit.com/r/RandomActsOfPolish/comments/12fz0j/as_requested_here_is_an_official_list_of_those/).

In brief:
----
A redditor by the name SweetBabiRay was highly active in RandomActsOfPolish, and gift chains.  She gifted people often and was gifted herself quite often (as is likely to happen to active, generous members).  She posted screen-caps for her gifts, some with the confirmation numbers and some without.  

A **few** of those gifts shipped.  **Most of them, she wised up.   She started purchasing the gifts--but then canceled the orders before they shipped.  

Someone on the subreddit said she made off with 100 or more nail polishes

So what does that mean for us?
----
Well, but it could be in our futures.  We should start thinking about ways to catch a scam like this early on.  To get the brainstorming started, here are my gut ideas:

* I think we should start posting full confirmation numbers AND whatever name is listed as the recipient. Remember, then consider using your first and middle name or your initials.  It's what I've always used.
* Secondly, then they can take swift action.
* Finally

Almost everyone at RAoP knows about RAoA.  SweetBabiRay could already be operating among us with a new name.  Keep an eye out for anything suspicious

^(TL;DR: Someone at RandomActsOfPolish scammed dozens of people out of gifts and it could happen here!)

SAD UPDATE
----
Well, were victims of this scumbag.  RAoP's creator (OkraWimprey) let us know in the comments that SweetBabiRay's other username was **PixiBunny**, which will strike an unhappy chord with many of you.  I guess she posted some tear-jerker about her birthday and her little sister, and was gifted on Random_Acts_of_Amazon by a good many Amazonians, some of which you can see [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/Random_Acts_Of_Amazon/search?q=PIXIBUNNY&amp;restrict_sr=on).  You people did a terrific thing by trying to make the lives of some girl and her sister better.  The same goes for the RAoP-ers who polished her for her pregnancy.  I hope she was telling the truth about these things.  But if not, that's for her to deal with.  If there's one thing we Redditors know all about, it's karma. 

EDIT
----
It has come to light in a few recent comments/threads that PixiBunny's shipping address is in Vicksburg, but **it is entirely against our community's beautiful nature to discriminate against an entire city of potential RAoA-ers for the action of one crappy citizen.**  Be excellent to each other!

So, and sheer willpower to be better than she was every single day left me in awe.  She lived each day trying to make other people's lives better.  Even as she was sick and dying, she refused to let go until she knew that I'd be taken care of.  A week before she died she'd asked me whether I would be okay.  It was after I'd been employed for 6 months at HP.  Not knowing what was coming I reassured her, letting her know that yes, I'd be fine, I'm loving the job and doing great. 

Almost everyone around her was inspired by her spirit and kindness.  I remember that she had just had her second leg amputated and they'd told her it'd be at least 6 months before she would walk again and I thoroughly believe the doctors were just being optimistic at that point

She'd constantly take people in when they were down on their luck and try to help them get back on their feet.  A lot of times this resulted in someone taking advantage

So

Below is a list of what I and LadyAccountant were able to gather of mothers on RAoA, please just chime in if you'd like to be added and I'll try and update the table.  Feel free to pick a mother or two, or three and send off a gift. :)  A special thanks to LadyAccountant for not only assisting in putting together the list, but it was a comment by her that partially inspired this.

My my what a year it has been. It's **RAOA's 1 Year Birthday** today. I was only recently made aware of this. The worst part about this PSA is that I'm having a hard time trying to come up with the words to explain how I feel...


//~~~~~ **How I feel

This place is singlehandely the coolest thing I've ever been apart of. I've seen a lot of things happen on this little corner of the interwebs. From the bottom of my heart, lurking, gifting, thanking, Contest-an, etc. etc. here on RAOA. I know a few of you have spun off into other little corners, but I know a lot of you have stuck with us as **One of the largest subreddits

I'm going to keep this part with a lot of I statements and what not to make sure we have some juicy tidbits that make my modhat a little tighter if you know what I mean. 

Back in early 2011 when I stumbled across this group of lovely chaps and lasses, others that have slipped through the cracks. those are just the names I remembered. 

4chan was the wild west

The early stages were the hardest. Trying to figure out the rules, all I wanted for us to have the 4chan threads back, but on reddit. Obviously this worked a little differently, but I brought a few people in as moderators that were my friends, that were trustworthy and that I knew had some sort of experience before.

This is the part where I thank my friends on modsquad

First and foremost to /u/Sir_Peanut_Butter. I love this man like he was a brother to me. We've been around the longest (along with /u/AlienPMK). These two brits are two of my favorite people and their kindness has affected me tremendously. TinyGami as some of you might know

Then there's Vinny and Ash. Both guys from the old days and two of my closest friends. Ash is a former moderator here. He was my #2 guy when we started this and right now I'd like to thank him so much for all of the work he's put in. We wouldn't be here if it wasn't on the sweat of his brow. Vinny is a confidant. He's a sagely man I go to for advice. If you've ever been on the skype chat

I'd like to thank /u/re_mix She's mah baby mama. This is my way to pay child support because RAOA is our babeh. &gt;.&gt; &lt;3 She's the one that set up our birthday CSS and without her work

/u/DersEvvak is probably one of the most enigmatic men I've ever met in my entire life. The reason he has his name is because one time we egged him on to post with a user name. So he decided that the next post, dependable, honorable man that I'm proud to have on my team, and call my friend. Thank you.

SirRipo and Thornz. Two guys who I need to meet in real life and buy them a case of alcohol each. Thank you guys for sticking with us. (SirRipo a former mod btw)

All of the people mentioned above I knew **before** we started this thing. Now I need to thank my new friends. 

/u/kbunneh. thank you for the time you spent on modsquad. Your busy bee butt was welcomed and it was amazing what you contributed to the fray. Thank you for all you have done.

/u/Legasia The Mod-aholic. This woman could moderate a school of fish and keep it in order with her hands tied behind her back. She is that good at what she does. She was here welcoming everyone on their intros before we even did. Her cool mind, so much.

/u/deimorz This guy built /u/Automoderator and is a god amongst men. He's saved the entire modsquad countless hours of busywork with his bot and it's helped us keep this place neat

/u/MeghanAM and /u/Sp3cia1K The two sisters from another mister. While new

/u/BaconBiscuits This little Scot has been kicking arse and taking names on our modsquad for awhile, we wouldn't be at 10k subscribers today.

Alright. So now that I've collectively thanked all of the modsquad past and present (and some key influential people who have helped shaped us) I'd like to address the rest of you 10k+ and the 2k+ that are still active here (Next thread I post will get into our statistics and some other cool shit so hold on tight.)

This community hands down has shown me there is hope for us yet. As you're reading this more than likely, whatever. I've encountered some people who've told me that this is materialistic. We're just propagating a consumerist society and that there is no real substence here other than the acquisition of goods but let me tell you something pal. That is so far from the truth you might as well be doing the conga with penguins around the exposed tusks of mammoths down on the polar ice caps. This place is designed to complete a process. 

* You pick up a story
* You read the story
* You get something out of the story
* You see how that story applies to the rest of your external surroundings(We come in at this step)
* You **SHARE** the story with others so they too may know what you've learned. 

This process, or heard about and hope to pull something profound from it! That's what it means to be an Amazonian! This is why we don't keep track of numbers. Why we discourage whoring and begging. Why we keep ourselves presentable and not lost in a myriad of shallow, pointless shit that we sift through to get to the point. I'm trying to take life, extract it like olive oil and keep it ""extra virgin."" 

This community has proven to me that this is a possible, may grow independently and share with others this experience.

You have all moved me to strive to be a better person. What you've done is taken a tool of learning and made it viral. Whether it'd be the gifting train from a few days ago

I promise as long as I'm breathing I will dedicate myself to this place and make sure that we as moderators

TL:DR - Please read what I have written. I've taken the time

Next PSA will have Stats &amp; Stuff. &lt;3

/u/chronos42 and /u/pony_hawk would like to draw attention to a plague that is beginning to affect our RAOA community. The infection started somewhere in the vicinity of /r/WTF, and if we don't act now, us.

**THE DOWNVOTES ARE HERE. THE TIME TO SECEDE IS NOW.**

Yes

**We will secede from the unholy conglomerate that is reddit and form our own nation

As with any new society, like a newborn babe. After learning more about structure and conformation, our adolescent period will naturally bring rebellion and lawlessness. Anarchy will be fun for a while, but eventually we will settle down and all agree that in this time of separation from our mother reddit… RAOA needs a leader.  

---

So

Now it's time for us to find someone to lead us into the wilderness

* **Create a name for your party.**

* **Develop a campaign slogan.**

* **Design yourself a campaign poster.**

* **Any other elements that you feel would help your campaign are also welcome.**

Chronos and Pony will be running too. [Our humble poster](http://i.imgur.com/3yNBLPJ.png).

Feel free to include any additional platforms, doodled, Adobe Illustrated, or Microsoft Painted to your little heart’s content.

**Chronos42 and pony_hawk will each choose their winners on the morning of Monday

1372165435.0,1h19f7,[Thanks] gosphy55 for sheer amazingness. These words here aren't even enough to show how thankful I am.,Matronix,64,0,80,"Morning... Well at least I think it is morning... I could be dreaming

* **THANK YOU** So much /u/gospy55 for what you have done. I can't even comprehend this right now. Like really I can't.

* Like honestly... I am at a loss of words right now... so trying...

* We went to bed early last night so I didn't get to see this happen when it did. I woke up this morning (still in bed) to a message on my Facebook from /u/jojewels92 saying [this](http://i.imgur.com/YrCy68u.png). This confused me

* I think I figured myself out. I think it was the first LEGO Minifig Unboxing video that I did where I said I am emotionless... this is where it sucks. But I think my reaction is a lack of words instead of a massive amount of tears... I am genuinely speechless... and this doesn't happen. If I could pull a ringer in here to cry happy tears for me I certainly would. 

* Conversation with the girl this morning while in bed. 
 * Me: Ris
 * Her: WTF?!
 * Me: Am I shaking?
 * Her: No.
 * Me: I feel like I am shaking. Should I be crying right now?
 * Her: I would be.
 * Me: Yeah you are a little crying monster. You would be crying.
 * Her: Do I need to oil my little robot? Are you broken?

* I think I am just trying to wrap my head around this (I know I am rambling and I don't care.)

* Gosphy55 you are amazing and awesome and like all that jazz.... *jazz hands* I can't even explain how I feel right now or how grateful I am to you right now. You didn't need to do this... not one bit. If I could give you a big hug right now I would.... Like big hug

I feel as though this thanks post isn't even an iota of what it should be or what I want to be saying. I just want to know that what you have done is greatly appreciated and I will remember you always for it. You are just fantastic.

I smelled something funny when there started being downvotes. It seemed weird. There was competition. Not much was done about it. I sensed things would go wrong when I heard about gift chains, some were fine. I just had a bad feeling.

Now all of this going on? I feel we are losing our community vibe people? We need to save that! Using our compassion, gifting or giving the gift of conversation, we shall hold on to that community, family feeling.

Please don't let me down. I know we can make it through all of this. It could be the beginning of the brilliant new era or the start of hell. I hope everyone makes the right decision.

Before I get into our MAJOR news announcements I would like to personally THANK every single one of you for subscribing to this subreddit. To see this concept jump to nearly 1500 people is astonishing to me. We were once a group of about a dozen hardcore people and another couple dozen people rotating in and out. Now

With that being said there are a few things which we

**1.) Please post an [INTRO] Thread!**

Remember folks

When posting an [INTRO] Thread make sure you follow the FAQ on the sidebar to see how to use this subreddit to the fullest extent. If you don't know how to make a wishlist

**2.) A [Contest] Thread needs these things!**

* What the Contest requires
* When you're going to gift the winner
* A dollar amount is a nice thing to add
* A message to the mods if you don't see it on the sidebar within 4-6 hours of posting.

When you end the contest

* Edit the OP to announce the winner
* Message the Mods with your winner and link to your contest so that we may remove it from the sidebar.
* PLEASE Make a [Gifted] Thread

**3.) A [Gifted] Thread is awesome! A [Thanks] Thread is equally as awesome!**

When posting a [Gifted] thread

**4.)** Now for some ACTUAL News. We're looking for a new Skin for the reddit! If ANYONE knows how to do that PLEASE message the moderators and we'll take suggestions and hold it to a vote if there are more than one option. We are also in talks to get an Auto Mod bot. Where the [TAGS] will be come VERY important. We ask you to please appropriately take the time to tag your post!

**5.)** The Birthday Calendar will be something that we will be keeping up with! When we get a chance

**6.)** There is a tournament coming up hosted by our lovely mod /u/CropCircles! It's playing the game Boardgame Online

**7.)** There shall be **NO STATISTICS GATHERED** on this subreddit. People shall be gifted as they see fit. As this would eliminate the *random* aspect from this subreddit and spiral us into a e-dick measuring contest.


Alright folks! That's it for now

While the name over on your sidebar says I'm the one who created the subreddit

The room in most desperate need is the kitchen. Original lead-painted metal cabinets that have not been sanded or re-painted since the house was built; broken and cracked asbestos floor tiles; every building hazard known to mid-century architecture. Lest you think I'm exaggerating

Since the money just doesn't exist for a true renovation, I've decided fun and humor are the way to go. PaganPirate has dubbed it my ""kitsch-en"" project, which is my new favorite term ever!

I needed a quick project to get me started, plus 10 drawers/top panels, I broke down and bought an electric sander. And that's when my motivation ran dry.

Well, I think I have one more for you"". He goes back into the truck and hands me out a [freaking huge box](http://imgur.com/vjiUG81) that measured about 3' x 3'. 

I opened the smaller box first, there was the emotional kick in the pants I needed, as well as many of the necessary tools to get the job done. But that still left the mysterious gigantazoid box to open.

Inside was an item I have been pining after ever since first discovering  it on Amazon. [The most kitsh-tastic freaking kitchen clock I have ever seen!](http://imgur.com/62AscH3) Even the flipping clock hands are kitchen utensils! Lol.

Sp3cia1K, I don't know what is!

You are cordially invited to the second ""Amazon Bomb"" mass gifting spree extravaganza: Electric Boogaloo this evening located at a place to be determined. We will edit this thread with the correct information as we get it. 

However as a pre-game warm-up I will be hosting MOVIE DAY all day in the synchtube room: [Found here](http://synchtube.com/r/RAofA#/button/c/blue)

This evening we will be giving away two pots worth of prizes. Here's how the exact gifting tiers will break down.

* Note: ""The Garbage Heap"" is the remainder of the gifted balance. We will gift **up to** the amount of the tier you've won. If you have a small list  then that balance remaining will roll over. We will give away as much as this as possible to the last dollar/pound.

-----------------**AMAZON.CO.UK**--------------------

A GRAND TOTAL OF **168.00 BRITISH POUNDS** WILL BE GIFTED TO A POOL OF **6 AMAZONIANS**. 

* **Tier 1:** **GRAND PRIZE: 84 POUNDS WINNER: scethao**

Alright some final notes on how this will work.

* /u/Dersevvak will be the man behind the current working the 1s and 2s on this thing. Our selection process for winners will include a random number lottery from random.org. We will have your names times the amount of entries on a spreadsheet. 

* We will be using your wishlist in your flair and any lists attached to that list you've linked.

* If your name is called

* The fun part about this (and hopefully it'll be super easy in the synchtube) is that the **Audience** watching the LIVE gifting will be selecting your prizes a la polls on synchtube or Whose Line is it Anyways? style cat calling. 

* The Garbage Heap will be the final gifting. We will try to empty the balance down to the last dollar. If we cannot

**THANK YOU** To all of you who have donated. You've made this the single biggest gifting in the history of me doing this shindig. Also to the modsquad who I love dearly. Thanks for putting up with my crap guys. Finally to the rest of you all SIX THOUSAND PLUS. We started this little sub with 10-20 people rotating in and out and now we have one of the most active random acts subs on reddit. Lets get to #1 shall we? REMEMBER BE EXCELLENT TO EACH OTHER AND BE IN THE SYNCHTUBE!

It's really helpful for indecisive people trying to choose who to gift


***

When you post your birthday here, don't reply to a previous one so I can see it easier, and I will change it asap!


**Once I let you know that I have added your birthday, so feel free to let me know if you find anything that needs to be fixed. :)

**Update - 1/18/13:** I got a little behind again, I hope you still had great birthdays! :D

As an update on what's going on with my dad for those of you keeping up with it, and should finally be done with all of this! Thank you all for the well wishes and such, it really does mean a lot to me and my family :)
