Anyways, I disabled all the UI elements and I've incorporated one of my favorite parts of the game - the Heart - into my modus operandi.

Basically, or an NPC you have targeted.  When using it on an NPC, I found that the little Heart snippits were often focused on revealing the morals and intentions of the person you're targeting.  (For example, for one guard I targeted, the Heart said something like, ""He eats very well every night, even though his family doesn't.""  For another, ""He is the only one in his family who has not been taken by the plague."")

So basically, I will decide to either kill him, or knock him out and stash him somewhere safe.

It's a pretty gripping way to play the game because it really immerses me in the gameplay.  I am constantly making judgement calls regarding whether these people should live or die and it brings me closer to the characters,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,t3_11inb3

&gt;  Sure, but freeze time before it hits, so you can watch his reaction when you appear in front of him as he gets clobbered from above. Dishonored has multiple save slots available, and taking advantage of the ability to tear things up and then reload a fresh start encourages you to engage in some absolutely delightful mayhem.

&gt; Yet even though it allows you to wipe the recent slate clean, striving to be more or less murderous, and seeing a different endgame all offer appealing incentives to give it another go. It's a rare game that feels so compulsively replayable, but Dishonored is such a game. The compelling abilities, the bold artistic design, the colorful characters, and above all

**[The Verge](http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/10/8/3470486/dishonored-review)** 9/10

&gt; Dishonored succeeds, Dishonored succeeds as an ambitious game not content to take one thing and do it well. It demands more than most games ever will of its player, and gives more to players than most other games will ever manage.

**[Game Informer](http://www.gameinformer.com/games/dishonored/b/xbox360/archive/2012/10/07/dishonoredreview.aspx)** 8.75/10

&gt; Though I was frustrated by the chaos system and how it steers your actions, and ruthless. The team at Arkane Studios has injected an array of cool possibilities into the simulated city of Dunwall, and discovering them all is a blast. When you come face-to-face with the people who wronged you, your only dilemma is deciding which poetic method of elimination will produce coolest result.

**[GamesRadar](http://www.gamesradar.com/dishonored-review/)** 4.5/5

&gt; Dishonored combines a beautiful, tough enemies present a significant challenge, and the multiple outcomes, characters, and setting create an exhilarating world to discover. Dishonored is a game that you won’t want to miss.

**[The Escapist](http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/reviews/9961-Dishonored-Review)** 5/5

&gt; Dishonored gives you a beautiful, and then makes it your playground for grand misdeeds. Its story of political intrigue and betrayal is told at exactly the right pace, balancing information with action in a way that keeps you interested, but not overloaded. Dishonored is smart enough to know not to try too hard to impress you, and as a result, it will blow you away.

**[G4](http://www.g4tv.com/games/xbox-360/65646/dishonored/review)** 4/5

&gt; Even if you didn’t know that Arkane Studios was comprised of folks whose resumes include such acclaimed series as BioShock, and Deus Ex, you would be hard pressed to not immediately think of these franchises after taking one look at Dishonored in action, and rightfully so. And while it has a few quirks here and there, Dishonored delivers on almost every admirably/crazily ambitious promise made by its creators. It’s impeccably crafted gameplay and exquisitely haunting and detailed world stand in loving tribute to all of the iconic and acclaimed franchises that inspired it, and yet it still has a soul and style all its own. So if you feel like getting lost in a hypnotic world and engaging in a healthy amount of sword/magic-based badassery, do the honorable thing

**[Destructoid](http://www.destructoid.com/review-dishonored-236085.phtml)** 9/10

&gt; Dishonored is that game of 2012. It's the big intellectual property that comes to retail and shows up the competition by being bold, Arkane's aggressive, non-aggressive, unsubtle, sneaky, thoroughly versatile tale of intrigue makes for the kind of game that reminds us this generation isn't all straightforward shooters and ""me too"" trend-seekers. Its level design is some of the very best, its willingness to let the player decide their own path is exhilarating

**[IGN](http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/08/dishonored-review)** 9.2/10

&gt; It's a shame that Dishonored's story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts, perks and other upgrades will inform how they see and interact with this world, and no two play-throughs will be exactly the same. Dishonored is a game you'll talk with your friends about, and that you'll want to play multiple times. In this game there are always other paths to be taken and other challenges to conquer, and that's a refreshing thing indeed.

**[Gametrailers](http://www.gametrailers.com/reviews/m68kgw/dishonored-review)** 8.7/10

&gt; “Dishonored” gives use a big patch of world for use to explore, and many ways to go about it all. It’s an interesting and often invigorating experience; a stealth game not weighted down by genre conventions ; a first person shooter where you don’t have to fire a shot and where jumping won’t cause you pull your hair out. But the intricacy of all it’s moving parts makes it’s quirks and blemishes all the more damming. With a tweaked plot, more thoughtful and varied pacing and better sword play to match the brilliance of Blink, “Dishonored” would be a classic, instead of merely being excellent.

**[CVG](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUfe67noLcY)** 9.5/10

&gt; The one thing I took away from it is the more patience you show in game

&gt; ...

&gt; There's some great games games out this winter. Hitman and Assassin's Creed 3 particularly look great. But this is just, adventure type thing, where they've dumbed it down for the mass market. This is sort of like a real gamers game.

**[Shacknews](http://www.shacknews.com/article/76096/dishonored-review-story-driven-role-playing#)**

&gt; And for that reason, the future monarch that I had watched grow up in my time as their bodyguard. I began play in a non-lethal fashion, fully unaware that what I was about to experience went well beyond the traditional point-and-click RPGs.

&gt; ...

Here's a quick rundown on them:

**What a weird dream. Oh well, woke up with a tattoo and then never thought about it ever again. This is a Corvo who has no idea he has magic powers and who presumably suspects that the heart in his pocket is an elaborate practical joke""

* No magic allowed; no active or passive powers

**Oh dear, and no evidence that an external agent was ever involved. This means no sword and no crossbow, because stabwounds and protruding bolts are clear evidence of Corvo's presence. You're not allowed to choke guards unconcious because when they wake up they'd remember being attacked. Everything has to look like an accident.""

* Ghost
* No weapons allowed
* No knocking anyone uncouncious either  
* Powers like devouring swarm are allowed (in a city filled with rats

**Corvo Attano, and this means they have to see you coming. That means no aerial assassinations, no backstabs, no crossbow and no lethal use of powers. Instead, you should pistol-fire a warning shot and loudly announce your presence by making a spectacular entrance, preferably involving an explosion""

* No crossbow
* No killing enemies that are unaware of your presence
* Powers may only be used to ensure duels are fair (disposing enemy grenades/bullets using bend time)

****

Inspired

**Easy mode:**

**Karma** - Corvo is the embodiment of Karma

* Just what it sounds like; guards and citizens that are said to have killed other should be killed

**Hard mode:**

**Lucky Luke** - Being the fastest and best gunslinger to ever walk the earth, and he does not posess other powers.

* No sword
* No attacking unaware enemies
* However
* No powers besides Bend Time and Blink

**Are you a wizard?** - Having found out about his supernatural abilities

* No physical fighting
* All kills must be conducted by use of magic or means that make it look like magic (""Bend Time --&gt; use crossbow"" for example is allowed)
* (Alt. easier mode: destroying music boxes is allowed)

* 2. DETECTION: Detection counts as A) A detection meter getting filled completely (all 3 levels), but being seen by guards as you leave does. Take the patch to the left, and drop in the water, staying as far underneath as you can. As long as the detection meter never appears over a guard's head, you're clear.
* 3. NON-LETHALITY: Be careful of where you place unconscious bodies, it will count as if you killed them. The Granny Rags mission in the sewers is also currently bugged, and choking or using a tranquilizer dart on her counts as killing her. It even doesn't appear on the mission end screen (the game says no kills, but still considers Granny Rags a kill) You can get around this by just pickpocketing the key from her, and running away. As long as the detection meter doesn't appear, it won't mess up the detection or non-killing achievements.

challenges The Outsider to keep a piece of chalk 
from breaking.",12,3,http://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/12ecvf/an_overseer_professor_of_natural_philosophy/,"This is a true story of something that happened just a few years ago at The Academy of Natural Philosophy. There was an Overseer professor of natural philosophy there who was a deeply committed follower of The Abbey of the Everyman. His primary goal for one required class was to spend the entire semester attempting to prove that The Outsider was powerless. His students were always afraid to argue with him because of his impeccable logic and mastery of The Seven Strictures (also, he was a high-ranking Overseer and in the running for the post of High Overseer). For twenty years, he had taught this class and no one had ever had the courage to go against him. Sure, but no one had ever 'really gone against him' (you'll see what I mean later). 

Nobody would go against him because he had a reputation. At the end of every semester, ""If there anyone here who still believes in The Outsider's powers, stand up!"" In twenty years, no one had ever stood up. They knew what he was going to do next. He would say, ""because anyone who does believe in The Outsider's powers is a fool. If The Outsider actually had powers, he could stop this piece of chalk from hitting the ground and breaking. Such a simple task to prove that The Outsider is powerful, and yet he can't do it."" And every year, let alone have powers. Certainly

Well, and bore his mark. He had heard the stories about this professor. He had to take the class because it was one of the required classes for his major and he was afraid. But for 3 months that semester, he prayed every morning, while clutching his bone charm, that he would have the courage to stand up no matter what the professor said or what the class thought. Nothing they said or did could ever shatter his faith, he hoped. 

Finally, stand up!"" The professor and the class of 300 people looked at him, shocked, as he stood up at the back of the classroom. The professor shouted, ""You FOOL!! If The Outsider actually had powers, he could keep this piece of chalk from breaking when it hit the ground!"" He proceeded to drop the chalk, but at the exact moment he did, off his shirt cuff, it simply rolled away

The professor's jaw dropped as he stared at the chalk. He looked up at the young man and then ran out of the lecture hall. The young man who had stood up proceeded to walk to the front of the room and share his faith in The Outsider for the next half hour. 300 students stayed and listened as he told of The Outsider's powers, all you have to do is be a little more interesting.""

Epilogue:  

The young man was arrested the next day by Overseers for heresy. He was then falsely marked as infected by the plague and was put in the Flooded District

So yeah, upgrades, bone charms or powers besides Blink. It certainly isn't a perfect playthough, as I did use quicksave/quickload if  I made a stupid mistake or if I was decently far along in the mission, but I tried to keep the use of it low. 

But back to the playthough. I'm pretty happy with how this came out. Some missions could have gone better (House of Pleasure) and I did make some really stupid mistakes at some parts

**Crowd Favorites** - All the ways that are used for achievements

**Wizard** - Only use spells.  No equipment unless absolutely needed by the mission to complete.

**Thief** - Never be spotted, or fine piece of pottery you can get your hands on.  Try not to kill anyone.

**Unlucky** - Make every kill look like an accident.  Throw bodies into the water, if you encounter two guards, stab one and deal with the other in a believable manner while leaving behind clues like a whiskey bottle in his hand).  Be creative.  Kill as many or as few people as you want.

**Completionist** - Complete all side objectives as well as main during any playthrough.

**Warrior** - Fight everyone that you come across but make sure they know that you're there before attacking.  Shoot off your pistol near them

**Assassin** - Kill every hostile in the level silently and without being detected.  

**Mirror's Edge** - Run as quick as possible while avoiding combat as much as you can and go to the objective.        

**Hungry for More** - Play as Warrior but ring alarms to ensure you have more guards to fight 

**Inspector Gadget** - Device kills only (Razor trap, Grenades, etc.) 

**Pied Piper** - Only summon rats to do away with your enemies (once you've unlocked the power)

**Headhunterr** - Crossbow headshots only

**Inigo Montoya** - Announce your arrival with a *BANG!* and make sure that your enemies know you're there.  Then

**Like A Whirlwind** - Give no notice of your presence before dropping in and taking out foes with any and all means possible.  Bombs, spells, everything is fair game as you take down your terrified foes.

1359372637.0,17fa2l,Thoughts about Dishonored 2. ,Dhocco,31,5,44,"What is everyone's feeling about a possible sequel to the franchise? I thought I'd kick it off by sharing some thoughts about possible ways to expand the franchise. 

Dishonored : The Battle of Morley Isle. 
With the on going crisis in the capitol of the empire and the Lord Regent's sudden control

Even after his fall,would borrow heavily from the British conflict of the Government vs the Crown, also know as royalists vs parliamentarians.) Add to that an uneasy population that feels betrayed both by the Empress and the Lord regent you have an Isle on the Edge. 

The new Empress must try to resort order to the Isle by sending in her new Loyalist guards and of course Corvo. 

Here the game play would break down into you as Corvo choosing how to deal with the Islanders. Through the various missions you must crush the uprising and deal with the Lord Regent's last loyal regiments who are attempting to use the uprising to take over the isle and declare independent from the Empire. 

So you have the two main factions - The Empress's New Guard

This would be the first test of the new Empire. 


That would be if we wanted to include the current characters. 


My other choice would be the set the game long after the events of the first game. Perhaps 100 years into the future. Technology has stagnated due to the rarity of whale oil and the plague destroying so much. Perhaps now we begin to see technology that is based on other fuels. 

This leads to Dishonored : The Pandyssian Continent. The home of the plague and many other wondrous things. This could be set in perhaps a city build on the Pandyssian Continent. Perhaps not long after the events of the first game. A city that was meant to help the Empire understand and study the plague

You can join a rebellion against the empire with other natives in the city. Then decide if you want to crush the city or help bring peace between the different people. 



Still just random thoughts and I'd be interested on how people see them expanding this universe for the next game.

(I suffer from a disease called Replay-atitis) I would love a sequel and perhaps a multiplayer game mode to come along with it. Take Halo for example. I don't play Halo but you can play the campaign and all but after that there's infinitesimal amounts of hours to keep playing. I think that something like this would be something the fans would really enjoy. This is my idea for it:

Teams:
There are two teams, or Corvo. The other 10-20 people would be guards; City Watch guards and overseers.

Corvo:
Corvo will have his usual powers including Dark Vision, Bend Time, Devouring Swarm, Windblast and perhaps others in the future. In direct confrontation with many guards, Corvo doesn't stand a chance. If the assassin runs up and attempts to kill the guards, he will be easily shot and killed. If the assassin decides to act decisively and hide in shadows, he can take out the guards. Perhaps a non-lethal takedown will give more points. Corvo will have to scavenge for many things across the map such as crossbow bolts, runes to unlock the more powerful powers
The Guards:
This class is on the lookout for Covo and must kill this man. At first their job seems easier because it is 10-20 soldiers looking  for one man

Squads:
With some people elected as commanders

1. Swimming is craptastic. There's very few points in the game where water is likely to come into play, but I'm curious as to what other people think about it.

2. Aiming blink for climbing up. I felt that this was constantly buggy. I'd stop time, time finally unpauses and everyone sees me. Reload, do it again and the indicator appears instantly. Sometimes I point and get the indicator with no problem, sometimes it just doesn't appear. This was a bit more of an issue because it really made the reliability of the blink power unpredictable. I would say that during my stealth playthrough Blink not working was responsible for about half my reloads. 

3. I feel like my character is 5 feet wide. This was only an issue a few times, etc. etc. Again - this issue didn't come up often, but when it did it was annoying as hell.

1360612902.0,18bsiy,A few points about The Outsider,WaxyPadlockJazz,31,6,20,"CAUTION: SPOILERS AHEAD

I just posted this as a comment on The Outsider page of the Dishonored Wiki after finishing the game the second time. I figured I would copy and paste it here to see what you think. It's a long one. 

I thought The Outsider was an excellent character with depth which you actively have to seek out. However
POINT #1:

The thing I can't stand is how little they resolve him in the end. The initial encounter with him mysterious and is great. Then there are pretty frequent shrines and hallucinations where he speaks to Corvo and comments on his behavior. Then on both of my play throughs

That's it. 

You're never confronted again. The next time you hear him is the ending voiceover. I felt like his presence/contact should either grow or remain consistent throughout the game but instead his presence becomes increasingly spotty toward the end. Almost to the point where I forgot he existed.

I was actually pretty livid at first because I was looking forward to at LEAST one final face to face with the guy. I was hoping he would appear at the end (before or after you confront Havelock) to reveal something or drop a bit of wisdom or have a last meeting but......nothing. Just a 30 second wrap up and a farewell. 

I understand the argument that he is a neutral onlooker whose motivations are not clear. I know that he appears to certain people he finds interesting

((Side note: I really liked the whole part with Daud because even though the Outsider clearly has a great investment in Daud

POINT #2:

I was also hoping he would shed some light or have a connection to another story line I felt wasn't adequately dealt with. The plague. 

I subscribe to the idea that The Outsider is in some way responsible for the plague. That or he's been at least fueling it's fire all along.

Think of who we know he contacts:

1) Corvo - a man seeking redemption and vengeance against those who wronged him.

2) Daud - a foreigner with the mindset of an assassin

3) Piero- an inventor who can create any number of dangerous weapons

4) Granny Rags - who we are led to believe he drove insane and keeps the rats as pets

They can all contribute to the plague by driving body counts or cultivating the rat population (he literally gives you the power to conjure them from thin air).

We also see references to him scrawled on the walls in the blood of plague victims. It's understood that The Outsider is well known in the world as an evil, where I think he has a hand in driving them mad to the point of becoming feral Weepers (kind of like he did with Vera Morley/Granny Rags). 

Motivation? It may be that, especially when it's used by those who curse his name and write him off as the bad guy. So he affects those those he likes and who have the ability to create chaos. This would explain why he's so cavalier with what happens to the citizens. 

It is plausible because it doesn't conflict with his neutral status. He's giving them an easy avenue to create chaos and destroy the city

Anyway, there was nothing to tie them together or give closure to either story line. 

My apologies for this lengthy ramble. As I said at the beginning

Would you like to see a short film merging the worlds of Dishonored and Portal together? Well

One of my peers at my University- a very talented double major in Film and Visual Effects- is aiming to create a live action short film based on the origins of the portal technology from Portal and Portal 2 , but also an approach to the effects not seen before, created by an outstanding VFX crew. 

Watch the video above for a sneak peak! (effects are not final and will vary compared to the final project)

Now this is where you come in. For this to happen, such as shirts, buttons, signed merchandise, DVDs and Blu-rays of the film and even actual props from the movie!

I certainly understand if you cannot donate, everyone on the cast and crew would be greatly appreciative!

So if you are a fan of Portal and/or Dishonored, sharing, and/or upvoting this post!

Thanks so much,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,,t3_1j65uy

Truth is

I had a couple other trouble spots at the Boyle Party, the culprit was Lydia Boyle (red), which was a pain in the ass because I couldn't nab her until she mosied into the stairwell on her own.

By far the easiest mission? Light at the End. Laughable. I just blinked into the right-most entry pipe, I managed to climb on top of the supports leading up to the lighthouse. Very few guards.

Seeing those achievements pop up one-by-one was extremely satisfying. I haven't tried to play a ""dark"" game yet or a completionist game

I just finished my first playthrough, my interpretation of Corvo was that he *acted* like her father whether it was a biological relationship or not.

My question to this sub is, the Empire's leadership changes **three** times.  And assuming she was safe, she'd still be a new monarch taking the reins of an empire absolutely ravaged by plague.

Why would Corvo subject her to that?  One of the books mentions that Jessamine's father was not close to the throne, and there are probably other blood candidates available.  

We see during her interactions with Callista and Corvo that Emily is still obviously immature

It's implied that Corvo himself guides her in court (or manipulates her, the impression I got of Corvo is someone who would not want that responsibility, and would have preferred a simpler life where he could easily protect Emily.  Maybe this comes from watching shows like Game of Thrones, but my instinct as a father-figure would be to get her the hell away from the throne.",,False,self,False,t3_141bbk

I don't know if I'm late with this idea but after a ghost/didn't kill anyone/mostly flesh and steel playthrough I'm playing a high chaos ghost run without using blink.

It's pretty fun killing everyone. Obviously you need shadow kill (expert mode: do it without shadow kill) and maybe the double jump.

I enjoy this run very much but it is not rewarding at all.
The wanted posters show my face although no one saw me.
And The guards talk about a man in a mask.

I'd find it awesome if they'd talk about Guards disappearing out of nowhere or an evil Ghost who kills everyone if the corpses may have been found.

But nothing like that is in this playthrpugh to make it worthy.
But still...it is fucking fun!

And without using blink you may find path you never noticed the first playthroughs.

If you want to get both Ghost and clean for that part:

* Talk to granny rags
* Choose the option to cut up slackjaw
* Go pick up the last painting in granny's shack
* Go back and sneak up on Granny (If you try to kock her out you will automaticly start the boss encounter)

There are many people in the community who would like to see some form of multiplayer put in to the game and there are many others who think it would be a bad idea. I’m here to offer some ideas about how it could be implemented without ruining the feel of the game but at the same time create and enjoyable experience for those who want to test their magic and metal against other players. 


First off: when I say multiplayer I know many people have a knee-jerk reaction to think of something like Call Of Duty/Halo style death-matches


I’ll list a couple ideas of game modes that would fit well with an assassination type game

**Lord Protectors** – This game mode would involve a team of elite guards protecting a target from a team of assassins (not Corvo, after a minuet for the guards to prepare the assassins are let out and are then tasked with eliminating the VIP as the guards do what they can to stop them. One life for everyone and a time limit of 10 minutes or so, you get the picture. 


**Death-match** – Because it’s popular I could see this one being available


**Distillery Control**- Domination style or King of The Hill type game


**Blueprint Grab** – 2 teams, only the flags are blueprints to the other teams arch-pylon. Once one team has gotten the appropriate amount of blueprints the pylon is completed and the enemy team is vaporized. 

You can imagine other game modes as you please, the first being a class based choice system: take the “Doud’s assassins “ team for instance. 


*Assassin* – Comes with rank I blink ability as well as a crossbow (normal bolts), Silent footsteps II and some health potions (2.)


*Hunter-Witch* – Comes with rank I blink, more mana than the assassin as well as more efficient regeneration in the form of a potion and possession rank I. 


*Outsider’s Chosen* – Rank II blink, time warp (it would work more like a phase shift in multiplayer, making the character immune and invisible to anyone not in the same phase) as well as 2 or so mana potions. 


The guard’s team would focus more on things like vitality, etc. 

The second option to creating a multiplayer character would be to have more customization
Say you wanted to create a character that deals with heavy-magic
Of course some upgrades would have to be worked on for multiplayer


I think that it would be very impressive to see a multiplayer mode in dishonored


I put a lot of thought in to this so any suggestions

1373807478.0,1i9vom,My ideas for a Sequel,AdilMasteR,25,7,16,"Dishonored had me waiting from when the first trailers came and to release and it was so worth it

**Main additions**

A sequel wouldn't really work if you just set it in Dunwall after the main events of the first game, but maybe not as open-world as say Assassin's Creed. Greatly designed and as free as you want it, but not with unneeded space. Maybe a linear open-world would work, a bit like games like Need for Speed or Thief 3 (not sure how Thief 4 will be yet). Then it wont be as boring as Assassin's Creed world because it adds a lot more of designing. It would also be cool if you could steal from houses like in Thief.

**Art Design**

Dishonored is a beautiful game, and at the same time bring forth lots of landmarks. You could revisit some of the noticeable places of Dunwall in a sequel and at the same time show lots of new places in the new city. Landmarks are what really shows the epicness of the game, and creates those ""Wow"" moments.

**Equipment system**

With a semi-open world you can use a much more complex trading system where different kinds of stores can sell different things. You could have a home of your own where you can craft upgrades or bone charms and make different kinds of potions or gems with ingredients you may have bought with money that you have got from selling stolen artifacts at certain shops. You could maybe be able to buy clothes and s on to change how you look.

**Ability System**

In the first game they didn't really have much customization. You could get the ability, but when you want to upgrade it you could choose 1 out of 2/3 upgrades to get for the ability, and then 1 out of 2/3 again the next time you upgrade that branch off of the first choice. So while the first choice may be pretty normal, the branching choices can have some different effects. This adds a lot of replayability since depending on your ability choices you can get entirely different playstyles.

**Example given for Vitality:**

*Vitality:*

Gives you additional health

*First choice:*

* Extra Vitality: You get additional damage resistance

* Regeneration: You get minor health regen

*Second choice:*

Extra Vitality:

* Explosion Resistance: You take less damage from fire and explosive weapons

* Bulkiness: You take less damage from melee weapons

Regeneration:

* Blood Leech: Your melee attacks and assassinations have a lifesteal effect

* Magical Regen: You get a small amount of health when using an ability

**Example given for Blink:**

*Blink:*

You can blink to places

*First Choice:*

* Blink Freeze; Time freezes when using Blink

* Improved Usage: Blink takes less mana to use

* Lengthy Blink: Blink has increased range

*Second Choice:*

Blink Freeze:

* Blink Heat: When using blink

* Invisibility Blink: After using Blink you get invisible for a short duration ( can only be used once every x seconds)

Improved Usage:

* Speediness: After using Blink you get a movement speed boost for a small amount of time.

* Double Blink: After using Blink you have a short time to use it again without any mana costs

Lengthy Blink:

* Floating: After blinking you can move in the air for a small amount of time.

* Gravity Rush: You can blink onto ceilings and stay there for a small amount of time

**Additional Replayability**

*Challenge Mode*

A gamemode similar to Dunwall City Trials could be in the game on release but with more versatile and more randomly generated challenges. There could also be rewards added into the main game, and of course a leaderboard.

*Co-op*

A 2-player co-op campaign similar to that of Portal 2 or Far Cry 3 in that it follows two different protagonists during about the same time as the main game. It could be more linear than the main campaign

There could also be co-op on some of the challenge missions

*Level Editor*

This is a very ""if"" request. I don't think we'll have a chance of seeing this at all but if it was in the game you could create your own campaings or just challenges for other people to complete.

**Multiplayer**

This is something that I think was missing a bit from the original game since it fits and would add so much replayability. It doesn't maybe fit the story that much

*Plague:*

Like Infection from Halo. One player starts out as an infected and the others as City Watch/Police. If you get killed by the infected you turn infected until everyone is infected.

*Gang War:*

Dauds gang vs. Another gang with some powers. Basically Assassin's vs Assassins's straight up team deathmatch.

*Assassination:*

Kind of like a VIP gamemode. The guards are transporting a noble and it's the assassins' job to kill it. There would be more guards than assassins.

*City Watch vs. Assassin's*

Team Deathmatch between guards and assassin's. Guards would have more health and so while the assassins would have to use their agility.

*Masquerade:*

Similar to the Assassin's Creed multiplayer. everyone is assigned a target and everyone has a hunter on them and you walk around to find your target without getting killed yourself.

There are oviously a lot more possible gamemodes but these were just some of them.

**-----------------------------------------------------------**

If everything or most of this was added to a sequel I would gladly give it my personal Best Game of the Universe award

I just finished the new DLC a few minutes ago

The new nonlethal options were great, due to me going for a Low Chaos run, but it was a nice feature nonetheless. I loved the Thief-esque system of purchasing gear, upgrades and ""Favors"" before the level, though I felt it would have been better if you were buying this stuff by going around the Whaler's Base and purchasing things from merchants. Essentially, the Hound Pits but in the Whaler's Base. Though I can fully understand this being excluded due to time/budget constraints.

The level design was at it's strongest in the first level - The Slaughterhouse in general was really well done. It was a very different environment to the main game

The Legal District was pretty fun, at least without alerting the guards.

The Final Mission is probably the worst part of the DLC, having to arduously go around and essentially repeat the same scenario 4 times (Freeing the Assassins) in a map you already know, with no large changes other than throwing in a few Overseers, hanging up some Abbey flags and some very minor scenery. 

Granny Rag's ""Recipes"" were a nice addition

The Story however, but they had to rush it - This is a DLC, not a full game. They couldn't take their time with the storytelling, and because of the large plotline they chose to handle, it just ended up feeling incredibly rushed and hurried, at least to me. The little 'Slideshows' between the missions just felt like them saying ""Here's all this stuff that happened but we don't have enough time or budget to actually show it to you. Just take our word for it."".

Billie Lurk's betrayal felt... Well, while certainly an interesting character, wasn't given enough time around Daud for you to build up a connection with them. The betrayal felt trivial, because while it's all well and good to say Daud has known this woman nearly his whole life, the player can't exactly feel like they've been betrayed by an old friend because we've only seen this woman occasionally throughout the DLC. 

Chaos felt pretty pointless here. I plan to do a run on High Chaos later, I speculated that on Low Chaos, the ending would be Corvo sparing you, and on High Chaos, the ending would be Corvo killing you, an idea which I still feel should have been included. 

TL;DR They bit off more than they could chew with the Story, the new Spells, Equipment and Side Quests are all cool and the Level Design for the most is pretty good. I'd say it stands at around 6.5/10. Certainly worth $10.

____

Oh well honor for all of the big and the small

Well the taller they stand well the harder they fall

We live for today but we die for the next

With blood in our veins and the air in our chests

Oh we step into war with our hearts on the line

The dirt on our boots it shakes free over time



&gt;The music it fades

&gt;The violence slows

&gt;The darkness it rises

&gt;As the sun goes



Love is a distant aroma at best

A withering smile that stuck deep in your vest

The night 'ere it wraps its fingers around

Your body it shakes from a now distant sound

Oh the sound of her voice a sweet symphony

Played over and over until you are free



&gt;The music it fades

&gt;The violence slows

&gt;The darkness it rises

&gt;As the sun goes



&gt;Can you feel the

&gt;New day rising

&gt;Climbing up the

&gt;East horizon

&gt;They can't hold us

&gt;Down we'll fight through

&gt;Each and every

&gt;One will start new



Well we shall not stumble no we shall not fall

We shall not crumble no we shall stand tall

Well death it will come as sure as the night

We will not run no we live but to fight

Oh with blood on our hands and dirt on our knees

We tear at the ones who brought the disease



&gt;The music it fades

&gt;The violence slows

&gt;The darkness it rises

&gt;As the sun goes

Normally I would join these people in their cries against the developers for missing the main point of any plot driven game.

But Dishonored is different.

I like to think of the possible story paths not as simple high chaos and low chaos choices


I'm currently working on a different mindset playthrough. One in which Corvo keeps his bearings and doesn't want anyone to die in his process of restoring order. He doesn't trust the outsider

The beginning (up until you're framed) is a bit brighter than I expected, it's nice to see a kid portrayed somewhat realistically. (Nice way to slip a sneak tutorial in, too.) What happened wasn't a big surprise, I was kind of expecting something like that.

Prison break/sewer stuff is okay, where have I seen this trope before?), look around, oh cool you can peep through keyholes, that's only the coolest thing ever... Then I go to sleep.

What the actual fuck is this? Did I click on Dishonored or Psychonauts?

I hope this game continues to surprise me. I'm on the first actual mission. Met the crazy old lady, and I can't wait to get the ~~Unrelenting Force shout~~ Windblast power.

What do you guys think the possibility is that Corvo is actually Emily's father? It seems hinted at pretty heavily. (I haven't finished a High Chaos run yet

* Corvo and the Empress were obviously very close.
* Jessamine is apparently single
* Corvo and Emily are obviously very close. Although it's never explicitly stated as such
* And the big clue
* When I played a low chaos run, more about Corvo's revenge.)

Emily's picture could just mean that she loves Corvo and sees him as a father figure. However, I would assume, and would have been kept under wraps. If he truly is her father, it seems that no one is aware. Otherwise I'm sure Havelock, Pendelton, Samuel, or someone else in the conspiracy would have mentioned it.

Even if he's not her father, it make me wonder who her real father is/was.",,False,self,t5_2sn3m,False,,

I have seen dishonored labelled as a steam-punk game. I've been thinking, Corvo's lens on his mask, etc), there is nothing I can think of that is actually steam driven: can we really call Dishonored 'steampunk'?

A friend of mine suggested it was, but again, I can't think of it as a tesla punk game because there's not enough... well, tesla!
