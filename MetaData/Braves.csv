1375722133.0,1jr07o,On a list of things that I'm tired of hearing...,pastyquail,120,11,40,". . . this ridiculous trope about the Braves ""only being good because they are in a weak division"" is very near the top of my list.

There are 6 teams in the NL who have a record better than .500 right now: PIT, LAD, AZ, and the Braves. The Braves have played at least one series with each of those teams, with the following results:

PIT - 4-3
CIN - 4-3
STL - 3-0
AZ - 4-2
LAD - 5-2

That totals to a 20-10 record against the best teams in the League

For those of you keeping score at home, and much better than PIT against the NL East (17-14).

Anyway, and 1 game behind BOS for the best record in baseball. With 112 games behind them, consistently winning against quality teams in spite of a bevy of injuries to both the pitching staff and the everyday players is not a result of a weak division; the Braves are a legitimately good baseball team.",,False,self,t5_2s0ok,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Braves/comments/1jr07o/on_a_list_of_things_that_im_tired_of_hearing/

I don’t know about you but I’m excited.  There was a lot of talk about the Nats being our biggest obstacle this season and I

I went over to invite the Nationals subreddit members to come over and chat during game time and I noticed something.  The last game thread they had 16 comments.  The one before that 69.  The one before that 108.  In our last game thread alone we had **434!**  The Braves are an amazing team

This is the best team in baseball and we’re going to continue to do our best to honor that by striving to be the best team sub on reddit.  So

Go Braves!

I dont know if you remember but there was a post a couple months back about getting a Braves player to do an AMA. I had told you all I was decent friend with him and I asked him about doing one tonight. He said he would definitely do it!! He also mentioned he would talk to Peter Moylan about them doing a tandem AMA. I thought it was a great idea so I am waiting back to here if Moylan will be confirmed.

We are probably gonna set it up for an off day during the season and right now looking at August 30th. 

The point is I wanted to let you all know it is happening!!! Its just a matter of when now. In the mean time please follow [him](https://twitter.com/KrisMedlen54) if you havent already.

If you guys have any suggestions or tips about this stuff that would be great. I have never set one of this up before. Also,False,self,t5_2s0ok,False,,headdress,t3_wot8k

“How’d you hear about this one, get something done and other people get blamed for it. [So] I just got traded [from Atlanta to Pittsburgh]. I was in Miami. The Braves happened to have an off day in Miami while we were finishing up our series, so all their gear came in and was in our auxiliary clubhouse, all the Braves’ bags. And I chose to skip BP that day and go to the back room and dig through everybody’s bags.

“And it just came to my head to pull out everybody’s underwear and sliding shorts, you might remember this. I’ll keep it clean, but I wrote on the dry erase board, I said, Hey boys, good luck and play balls out — LaRoche.

“So they all come in, all the Marlins clubbies. I said ‘Listen, hang everything up like nothing happened, I want these guys to come in and not see it until they get dressed.’ You got to talk to Chip. He said he sat in his locker for an hour and a half and just watched people come in, and obviously cuss me a little bit when they found out what I did. It was great.

“They paid me back when I came back to Atlanta, so I got the better end of that.”

How did they get him back? Well

“Um, it was getaway day, so they did the standard cut my suit up. Took my dress shirt, froze it. Cut all my equipment up, batting gloves, bats were broken. And then probably the grossest thing I’ve ever seen, Tim Hudson takes my backup first base glove and stuffs human feces up in the fingers of my glove. So needless to say I had to throw that glove away. Never got to use it again. Pretty disgusting.”",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Braves/comments/1fqz42/have_you_all_heard_the_story_about_the_pranks/

There are a lot of ways to evaluate talent

Freddie Freeman, 25, and Jason Heyward, 23 -- and you realize these three players already have a combined 6,500 career plate appearances. They are just getting started. 

Craig Kimbrel walks by. In 2012, Julio Teheran is 22. 

A veteran player in the room acknowledges the potential of the group with a nod and a laugh. “Dude, emphasizing the potential with that long, understated syllable. 

The first time shortstop Andrelton Simmons realized that he had an unusually strong arm, the shortstop for the Diamondbacks. Simmons is now 23 years old, and in the eyes of some Braves, he already is the sport’s best defender. Former Braves third baseman Chipper Jones wrote in a direct message Sunday that Simmons reminds him of Andruw Jones in how smooth he is, how effortless everything seems to look, including throwing. Rafael Furcal had a powerful arm and seemed to use his whole body to launch the ball, but with Simmons

At age 26, he is likely to be Atlanta’s frontline catcher. This has all been a whirlwind for him, all the attention about his past and his unusual bare-knuckles style of hitting. I mentioned to him that on a particularly cold day recently, the game announcers said it had to be really cold because Gattis was wearing long sleeves. Gattis chuckled at the whole legend thing; he’s having a great time but is looking forward to the day, he said, when “it gets back to being about baseball.”

The Braves’ older guys are talented, deep rotation, power up and down the lineup. “They may be the best team in baseball,” said a rival GM last week. “They’ve got growing to do, and they’re already really good.”

But on ""Sunday Night Baseball, but they will be needed eventually, inevitably.
Teheran didn’t have his best stuff against the Mets on Sunday, the Braves had a 2-1 lead. With two outs and runners on base, Gonzalez called on the only lefty in his bullpen, Luis Avilan.

Jonny Venters was one of the best lefty relievers in 2011 and 2012, but he broke down, after years of a heavy workload.

So Avilan has to move up to seventh- and eighth-inning duty, right-handed hitting Justin Turner was inserted as a pinch-hitter, with right-handed hitting David Wright scheduled to bat behind him, so Gonzalez called on right-hander Cory Gearrin, who is now the primary setup man. 

Turner singled, including a line-drive home run. In the past, Gonzalez had the luxury of reflexively going to the mound to call on another lefty.

But there is no other lefty. There is no Venters

Duda lifted a double inside the left-field line, of course, because Gonzalez didn’t have a countermove available.

Gearrin hit Baxter with a pitch, and no RBIs since May 9. Davis has been terrible against all pitchers, but especially against lefties.

However

Davis hit a hard single through the right side, before the game, Davis had met with owner Jeff Wilpon, general manager Sandy Alderson and manager Terry Collins to talk about Davis’ slump. It was a discussion, Davis said later, about getting back to having fun again. A game-winning, two-run single in the eighth -- that was fun, “That was awkward. I have gotten a hit before.” 

The Braves have a nice lead in the National League East this morning, for someone like the Marlins’ Mike Dunn. Maybe the fix will be Alex Wood, a 6-foot-4 left-hander who was the Braves’ No. 2 pick in the 2012 draft out of the University of Georgia; he has a little unusual motion in his delivery, a little funkiness, and so far in Double-A this season, he has a 1.26 ERA and just 15 walks and 1 homer allowed in 57 innings. Maybe he can be a missing piece for the Braves -- and maybe sooner rather than later.

**Fun stat because I feel like it:** In 1950 Sam Jethroe became the first african-american player for the Braves.  They were in Boston at the time and he played the outfield.  His first year he was named NL Rookie of the Year and for the first two years he led the National League in stolen bases with 35 a piece.  The first year he also hit 18 home runs.

**Fun fact because I feel like it:** The longest winning streak for the franchise was achieved by the Boston Beaneaters in 1891 with 18 in a row.  Their most valuable player in terms of replacement was a 25 year old short stop named Herman Long with a WAR of 4.7.	 Close second was 34 year old outfielder and first baseman Harry Stovey with a WAR of 4.5.

**Fun stat because I feel like it:** In 1950 Sam Jethroe became the first african-american player for the Braves.  They were in Boston at the time and he played the outfield.  His first year he was named NL Rookie of the Year and for the first two years he led the National League in stolen bases with 35 a piece.  The first year he also hit 18 home runs.

""Well
 
I vowed if the Braves lost on Friday night that I would disappear for awhile. Maybe spend my entire weekend curled up in a ball crying and avoiding major sports networks and all social media. Indeed, maybe not even anger. In a way, Friday night was like the culmination of 16 years of frustration, compounded by our impossible collapse last year.
 
I start off by saying that the clearly blown infield fly call (despite MLB's attempts to push it under the rug) was not the sole reason we lost this game. Three errors and multiple men left on base were prime reasons for the unfortunate outcome. However, but the Braves still had runners on second and third. The bases were then loaded and Michael Bourn could have capitalized, but he did not. It does not take a baseball rocket scientist to know that bases loaded and one out is better than second and third and two out. But ultimately, that play could have directly affected the outcome of the game. With the bases loaded, they could not have pitched around McCann because there was no base open. Imagine if he had hit a single? It doesn't just change the complexity of the inning or the game, it possibly changes the complexity of the playoffs themselves. Our win probability went from 22% to 9% after that call. It might seem inconsequential but there is no doubt that the call directly affected the outcome of the ballgame. There is no getting around it.
 
All of that being taken into account, but this team has been doing that often as of late. The safety squeeze was clearly a terrible idea and a wasted opportunity. However, we were in this game, backed by another strong outing by Medlen who deserved a better fate. It's sad that one of Chipper's last legacies will be throwing away a routine double play ball. We will be replaying that all offseason long. But, the Braves defensive and offensive woes should never be used as a way to overlook the absurdity of this game nor the call by the umpire. In fact, the Cardinals made an error and were bailed out by the umpires. Regardless of errors, each team has 27 outs. One of those should never have been taken away.
 
The ultimate failure lies not just with the Braves or the umpires, and this clearly fits the argument. Never should there have been a one game play-in, one game to erase an entire 162 game schedule. Baseball cannot continually defend such a long regular season, yet render it pointless by erasing it in one night. The true culprit here is MLB, who continues to screw over fans in favor of national television broadcasts and revenue. Our 94 wins is still six better than the Cardinals, and they will be the ones in the division series. No matter how you spin it, this is an absolute travesty for baseball and I have felt this way since it was implemented in the Spring. I would feel the same even if we had won. Though of course, all for spectacle.
 
And now, suspended reality. As though choreographed, dozens upon dozens of beer cans went flying over my head showering everyone on the way down. It was a display of emotion I have never seen from Atlanta fans. I was angry that people kept throwing things because I knew about the forfeit rule (though in hindsight, we know Selig never would have let that happen). But now, a day later I completely understand. The frustration had been building for a year since the collapse and here we were, in potentially Chipper's last game, the most crucial game of the entire season and the umpires cut our rally short on an awful call. I don't condone throwing anything on the field and yes, I can't help but feel a little pleased at the idea of Selig's worst case scenario: A one-game play-in with a blown call that potentially affected the outcome,"" should determine a team's season after 162 games. It's a travesty. MLB has done a great job attempting to screw over the fans for years
 
Ultimately though, I can honestly say that I am tired. Tired of watching other teams celebrate on our field, tired of this team not stepping up in the playoffs. But mostly, I'm tired of MLB continually defending and contradicting asinine ideas that do nothing to create fan excitement. They create controversy and resentment. And in this case, a heck of a lot of wasted beer.",,False,t5_2s0ok,True

What the stats say: The best measure of range is the Baseball Info Solutions' plus/minus metric, with Manny Machado right behind him at plus-25.

**Best infield arm:** Andrelton Simmons

*Simmons sat at 97-98 mph as a junior college pitcher and might have converted to the mound had he not hit .311 in his first full pro season. -- Keith Law*
