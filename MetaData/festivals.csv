Also, but it helped me to write it down and I hope its entertaining at least.

My friends and I got to the festival at about 5 o'clock with just enough time to catch the end of Beats Antique. We set up camp, but I met a couple people who wanted to start sooner and decided I'd change trippin teams to make some new friends. We got fun with some fungi and got to the stage around 700, with figure picking up the pace and people going crazy. 

Seriously

 As soon as we got in, I was the tall kid with grey/ blue baja who kept ending up half naked at the end of shows. 20 min in, I squeeze out for a water and mj break and meet some cool people at the back of the tent. 

(mad shout out to anybody from the show who reads this

Started dancing with some ladies and got lost for a minute

This kid.

This kid you guys. 

There was nothing in his eyes. His irises werent visible.  He wasnt even responding to all the information he was given, what he was on, or where his friends were. He tried, he tried his damnest, but it was all just too much for him. He was watching everything happen around him at once at the entirety of it was keeping him from driving his own actions. He couldn't even drink.

Now, but this was scary.

I cant get this kid's fucking stare out of my head.

I pulled him away from the support he was tripping over and called my friends and some people around to ask if anyone knew him. Nobody could say

Now

I dont remember exactly what happened, knew it was him. Separate and spin just in time to see him falling away from some guy and over the support. This guy christian (cool fuckin dude) and I caught him before he fell, but he was already off his feet. He just kept falling and I took his weight onto my ass (i was already half naked, sweaty, and muddy, christian was relatively clean). The fall scared him more, and he did the trippy thing where you check your pockets for all your shit. Hes still sitting up against me, making sure he sees it all. I grab his phone from one pocket and reach into his other and my hand touches a glass dropper.

Fuck. 

We'd had theories about what he was on, but what ever it was, it was all in his pocket and I think it was still getting to him. 

We're both on the ground now and (like festies) people start coming up trying to vibe him back to reality. The first guy has a kdana on and just keeps saying ""good vibes"" to his face while waving his arms around. I'm not gonna say that I dont apprec the help

All i could think to do was hold this kid in a manhug and tell him im also frying face and that we can do this. He looked at me

Reminder, covered in dust, with figure taking everyone to ear climax over and over behind us. Not really important, but its kind of a funny picture.

At some point (730 i think) adventure club took the stage and people just went wilder. It was loud

I started to see that this kid was in for more than he was ready to ride, he knew he needed to get some space, he knew we were all trying, but everything was still so much for him. Constant back rubs and telling him he's got this can only keep him so calm until we see cops and security enter the stage area. A big security guard came up and tried to talk to us, but he just scared the kid and I could only shake my head while keeping him from running away.

I cant even start to describe how hard this kid tried to communicate with me. He kept grabbing my shoulder and staring me in the face with those eyes, they just wanted to help, and that I was gonna get him ok. The big security guard came back with some police, and the kid nearly lost his shit. He grabbed my pants and arm with more fear than I know and if he couldve, he probably wouldve cried.

Held the cops off for a second, and we all picked him up and put him on a stretcher. They strapped him down when he started freaking out again and he gave me one last stare and groan. The weak grunt he let out, the way he flexed against the straps, and the fact that my last half 8 of shrooms was getting to me all combined into the heaviest, most real feel I had ever felt for a total stranger. It hurt you guys.

I tried to follow him as they wheeled him away


Yeah

I told this kid i was gonna get him ok, but he said the cops had him and it was beyond them.

So

There's a lot of things you can do on the interwebs, info, or stories from that show, I know its a long shot, and Im not planning on getting too much, but anything helps. 

I have to know this kids name

Nobody has to help, and the town, with no luck, so you guys might be my only chance.

So


Description of this kid:

Black hair
not short but below 6'
 wearing backwards flatbill,
had black and green strappack


TL;DR: Friday at Summer Set 2013, then the cops took him. I have to know his name, but I need your help.

This is not meant to be disrespectful or insulting; the point of this post is to give you the perspective of what it's like to be surrounded by cigarettes as a non (cigarette)-smoker. This past weekend, etc., but I don't smoke cigarettes and never have. That's a personal choice, and I do not judge anyone for smoking...but the point that I would like to make here, is that in enclosed, dense situations (such as a packed concert, or under a canopy, when you light up

During the first day of Scamp, as people would continue to light up all around me, and running from this was basically impossible unless I wanted to go all the way to the back of the crowd in isolation. There was literally a cigarette within eye's view during each show I was a part of, and I hope smokers understand that this does not only affect you, but everyone around you as well.

How do we solve this problem? Recently

**Do’s**

* Schedules / Pre Fest Research – If you’re going to a music festival to see live music..  do it!  Many festivals publish the lineup and/or schedule in advance.  If there’s particular acts that you want to see
* Rain Gear – Getting wet for an hour or two can be awesome!  Being drenched for 2 days is a buzz kill.  If at all possible
* Sun Gear – For as bad as rain can be – sun kills…  Don’t be stupid..  If you have a canopy available to bring
* It’s a Marathon, it kind of depends on your view of fatigue being a drug in and of itself.
* Medications – If you require particular medicines for daily living

**Don’ts**

* Buying Stuff..  Don’t buy anything from anyone who doesn’t fit in..  If you have any doubt

* Fireworks.  Look like fun from a far right..  Nobody wants to be around the asshole setting’em off..

* Some festivals are more zealous than others

* Trash – A lot of people go through a lot of effort to make sure you don’t have to throw your trash out – use them.  That goes for cigarette butt’s as well..  

* Tents – If you aren’t 100% sure ALL the required parts are packed, stake in one key corner than move to the next one (clockwise or counter) and pull it as tight as possible from the first stake – stake it, continue clock/counter pulling as tight as possible from the last one.

* And finally – most importantly – Don’t be a Dick..  Good vibes breed good vibes.

Stay safe festies and RAGE ON!

LIB was one of the greatest experiences I've ever had. I really didn't know what to expect considering I was preparing for BM for the greater part of the last year and to be honest i hardly knew what to expect for that either. I had watched plenty of videos to prepare me for the mindset of these festivals and i am glad i did.

One of the greatest lessons i learned from these videos and blogs was the idea of participation or tourism, others would look confused or creeped out, but about half the time i would see a light turn on behind there eyes and i would see a giant smile meet mine. Most of the time i would ask people for a lighter as a way to talk to the person, or if i saw someone looking like they were having a good time i would give them a high five and try to talk to them. The last night of the event however I ended up working at the Hug Deli for maybe 4 hours after Bassnector ended until the sun came up and im not gonna lie, it was the best time i had the entire time i was there. Nothing is more rewarding then standing there having people compliment you all night and giving out hugs to the amazing people there.

Creamfields music festival in Daresbury

We arrived friday, then saturday night had 2 weeks worth of rain. the campsites flooded, carparks flooded, the main stage sank in the mud with all the support beams bending.

Had to cancel the music on the sunday night as it was too dangerous to carry on

1345061006.0,ya1ns,Festival discgolf frisbees,BGSO,13,2,15,"So I finally ran out of money for fests this summer but still have northcoast on my agenda.  I know a lot people pay for festivals by selling tshirts they've made.  I'm trying to do something similar but instead of tshirts I've come up with the concept of a custom disc golf Frisbee.

At electric Forest they had something similar; however

The discs will cost 20 dollars and feature the logo of the fest and the date of it (possibly line-up.)  This is what the artwork will look like:

[http://i.imgur.com/Iipa7.jpg](http://i.imgur.com/Iipa7.jpg)

I think it's a good idea but I'm curious what a large group of festival goers thinks about the concept.  I'm about ready to invest the capital into the project and get it going but the thought of pouring money into a dead hole is not an appealing prospect.

If you'd be interested in one of these at a festival if it had different artwork please comment.  If you're going to Northcoast and would like one of these feel free to send me a pm.

I unfortunately have to miss thursday night of the forest due to work

I'm a 23 year old guy (if that matters) and will be travelling very lightly as my friends are bringing all my other shit with them when they are driving up on wednesday.  If anyone can give me a lift i will gladly pay for all of the gas/tolls and will buy you as many cases of beer as you can bring in.

Also i don't really care what you do to pass the time on the trip up.  Fine with smoking/drinking/any kind of music/dirty car/whatever.

Let me know!  if i can't find a ride i will have to get a plane to muskegon and take a very expensive cab.

Many of my favorite bands played on the first day (friday) adding some EDM acts to finish the day. During the dar i lost my voice after a Billy Talent concert and had such extreme muscle ache after Skrillex that i was barely able to walk...

On the last day i was so dehydrated and cramped up that i had to be taken to the paramedics. They gave me Magnesium there :)

As i am planning to go to some EDM festivals next year

What tips and tricks do you have for me?

**Summarizing everything we have so far:**

**Physical**
BEFORE the festival
*Work out. Full body excesizes like Lunges
*Go to more concerts and dance. ""Work out the party abs""

DURING the festival
*Stretch and flex
*Rest between acts
*Make sure you get some good quality sleep
*Medical tape against blisters

**Drinks**
*WATER. Get a Camelback
*Smoothies (Odwalla), Vegetable Juice (V8 low sodium), Coconut Milk
*Vitamin stuff such as Airborne or Emergen-C
*Sprite and Ginger-ale to keep the throat crisp
*More water

**Food**
*Fuits (Bananas!)
*Power bars
*Vitamins

In my opinion it is best to throw a large quantity of glow sticks at the same time at a precise moment in a song.  I am not a fan of a few random glow sticks being thrown at random times during the show.  I also hate when people throw them at the band.  I usually do not bring any more than 100 of them at a time but considering bringing a lot more to a near future show.  Anyways

EDIT:  So it seems the majority of people i have heard from on here and other forums say they are more annoying than anything.  Seems many do not like them for the environmental reason which i totally get and they are correct they are bad for the environment.  I keep hearing people say why don't you stay and pick them up and i keep asking myself if anyone else has ever littered at a show?  Does anyone who throws a cigarette bud on the ground or a napkin or a cup stay to help pick it up? If you are one who does that then that is awesome and preach on.  But don't tell me to pick up my glow stick as you flick a cigarette bud and drop your empty cup of booze.  Laser pointers? LED Hoop? those are not substitutes because they are not thrown or worn.  I can't believe people are entertained by shining laser pointers on speaker boxes and banners above the stage but if you are have a blast just don't shine it in anyones face.  LED hoops are cool to see people use but where i am at shows there isn't room for one of those being shoulder to shoulder with hundreds of people dancing so.  I guess you can't make everyone happy and no matter what you do at a show there could be someone who is annoyed by it.

Check out my Etsy shop, and use coupon code WANDERLUST11 to get 15% off of your order. Want something even more specific? Just shoot me a message, and I will make you the most amazing hoop you’ve ever seen :D

This is kind of a crazy scheme

Of course I will keep you all updated once I start making travel plans. Hopefully it will all go down within a month or so.

How ever during my limited research(you would be surprised how little discussion there is about Bisco) I found out that they do search your car thoroughly and that things such as fireworks

Do bongs/bowls count as glass and would they get confiscated?

Do sparklers count as fireworks? I was going to bring sparklers

I've read that the event staff don't really care and they aren't cops

My question is just how lax are they with the drugs entering and if I had an O or 2 in a backpack would they take it?

Also what is the best course of action to take when getting your car searched? Tell them up front or wait for them to find it? If they ask do I tell them for sure?

For any of you who have been to Bisco before that have any other tips that would be great, food, print out schedules of whose playing, lantern for campsite, cash money, old shoes, etc. Thanks in advance!
