Here is a few things I would like to see:

Realism:

* No magic whatsoever. I want to build a medieval village/city. Alchemists
* No unlockables. No 'raise 500 cows to unlock the Pink Barn'. No imaginary power ups by reaching a certain number of anything. Everything should become available naturally.

Gameplay:

* I would like the villagers to have a personality. A good example is Tropico. Those people live and breath. I would love to see Knut Workhard to be very skilled at chopping wood
* In addition to the above: I would like to have the option to banish citizens that are criminal, if you want to. 
* Randomness. This one is a bit difficult to describe, let's say, pumpkins. The benefit of these pumpkin seeds won't give you a big advantage, they aren't very valuable, but the fact that you found these rare seeds makes the game you play a bit more personal. The same could apply for villagers. What if one of your citizen is disabled, blind for example. He/she couldn't work as efficient, but would require food and shelter. Do you care for this person? Or do you simply banish him/her for being a burden? 

Dangers:

* I read the creator didn't want any combat, shouldn't be able to influence how you play. 
* I would like natural dangers, fire could start in abandoned houses, etc.
* Bandits (think small


Other stuff:

* 100% customizable maps settings / map editor

1370450716.0,1fqawn,Combat ideas and discussion,Haereticus,32,16,12,"Hello,"" but I thought I'd share my thoughts anyway in case the developer liked any of them and to spark a community discussion. Before I go on I'd like to say I totally support the idea of being able to play the game entirely without having to fight if you don't want to. As you'll see below I've also tried to emphasise the cost of war being a major factor anyway. The ideas below are based in part around what I know of the historical realities of the Anglo-Saxon military and the way armies were recruited

**Military unit types and recruitment**

* Armies in general are quite small

* Military units are of two types: household troops and mustered troops.

* Household troops are permanently at arms

* They are also expensive to maintain and require lots of facilities (training yards

* A muster can be called and a proportion of your whole population will come to war.

* They are cheap

* In battle the household troops act as elite units and commanders. The player can decide whether to disperse his household troops amongst the muster (good for holding defensive lines) or aggregate his household guards (good for a very strong offensive unit).

* A large population of bachelors gets restless and warlike.

* Can cultivate a large population of bachelors by building communal living halls.

* Mustering could occur at muster points (a normal building) around which encampments would be constructed during the muster. It is from this building the call to arms is issues and the army disbanded.

* A system could be implemented that allowed the player to make choices like what proportion of the population would be mustered, that kind of thing.

* Obviously the greater each of those values is



**Grouping**

* Detailed command of the army can be taken by allocating your army into different units. The player can mix and match the troop types in each unit as they please.

* Groups can be selected using the number keys as well as by clicking.

* Grouping could affect factors like morale



**Formations**

* Total War-like click and drag dynamic formation placement.

* Shield wall (defensive and offensive anti-infantry).

* Tortoise (defence against missile troops)

* Square (anti-cavalry).

* Wedge/boar-snout charge (aggressive anti-infantry).

* No formation means faster movement

* Better troops are better at formations and less disorganised.



[**Fortifications**](http://www.essentialnormanconquest.com/images/osehncimages/osehnc01801.JPG) (a picture of what I'd like to be able to build

* Relatively simple fortifications can be built. It would be nice to have very flexible placement and orientation and powerful and simple placement tools (for example

* More complicated fortifications like town walls can be staffed by a small rotating non-professional muster

* However

* It would also be nice if the system of fortifications could interact well with the system of terrain elevation so the player could construct terrain features like moats

Why not have have a dark/Gothic/haunted woods theme to the game.  I'm thinking along the lines of Duskwood in WOW.

Combat could be designed more around town defense and small drunken raiding parties to eliminate nuisance threats.

The more we venture out into the woods the more we provoke.  Making use of lookout posts or watchtowers, simple soldiers, and even drunken mobs.  We could have wolves, trolls, bears, and bandits. Or even specific enemies (think big bad wolf) taking people that wander out alone.  Once killed mounted as trophies maybe.

Letting people host their own servers for a group of friends would be cool. 

 **To balance the game**, remember. (or maybe it is two rivers, with a bay, and a short overland road, idk). The mountains would be rich in iron and stone, out of the mountains would have the forests, then the plains (deer/wood and farming, the ocean would have ????salmon fishing in the rivers???? The key is that every village would have every resource (except maybe the mountains and oceans wouldn't overlap

The idea would be that each map would have some of everything, but **little** (not none) exposed rock for a quarry, etc. That would induce trading of excess. But it would also encourage shippers, because a ton of food in the plains does nothing for the people in the mountains in the winter. Quarrying would be at a constant rate/area, trees would grow randomly at a certain rate if the average tree density drops below the threshold for that map, and would die if they ever got over the threshold. Farming would be the growing season and health of the crops (too much salt near the ocean), hunting would be proportional to the amount of forest, they hunt less

As an extension to the hunting remark: As your village grows, but holds all the storage and trading ships, and is well defended (if combat is added), and educates workers, etc. This would be how combat would work. To help a village defend, you would loan units, if you trusted your friend not to get them all killed! Then the player that loaned the people could bring them back by going to the village and ""buying"" them for free, you would set a price in the transaction, or just more in total

What this possibly means for yearly (game time) (maybe every 10 days RT) seasonal effects: Spring floods: no upstream motion. Salmon runs near the oceans at the right time. Winter: no farm growth

What this means for people hosting their own servers: If 10 people are hosting their own servers, etc.) 

What this means for the idea of a server in general: you could make the servers any size you want. Just scale up the size by stretching the procedural distribution, but people nearby are trade enemies! 

**On bandwidth** The heaviest use of bandwidth would be loading people's villages when others go to trade, what it is selling and at what price. Then every ten minutes or so, (or instantaneously), the new trade file would be updated on the village owner's computer if they are playing. If you need to, you could impose a ""can't change your bulletin board more than once per ten minutes"" rule. 


**Super hard mode** you voluntarily get a village with no river

**The battle, if peoples' villages pause while they are not playing? And if villages are paused while they are not playing, what stops people from lending workers to each other everytime they get off? (I guess you would have to feed the extra people, or have your consumption/production rates recorded, and have the server update your stores appropriately.) But everyone hates having a tamagotchi  (sp?) die on them because they got busy with school. 

**TL;DR:** Trading and worker giving are two things that could probably work.  For fighting, but the trading of goods and workers see to work well (given that there is some sort of time progression when you aren't on, so that you can't loan all your workers away right before you get off).

End wall of text. I'm interested in thoughts/reactions.

EDIT/ADDITION: So I actually got around to reading this: http://www.shiningrocksoftware.com/?page_id=680 And it seems like my thoughts are kind of in tune with the goal of the game. (I don't know how I feel about foresters actively planting trees, but maybe if this vastly different maps idea catches on, each map would have medicinal ingredients that could be used to heal different ailments. (all would have something like a fever reducer). OH! and mountains would have fur, forest and plains would have hide/leather. So fur makes warm clothing, and hide makes goods and kind of warm clothing, what of cotton on the plains?

What I am wondering is, ~~when someone stays outside during the night.~~ Nevermind. There are no nights.  
Or very hot summers with very little rain
These are of course only two examples of random number generation.

I am not sure myself
I know, a lot of people complained about Faster Than Light being too random and only dependent on luck. I personally liked FTLs randomness, because that means that no run will be like the one before.

So what do you think about this? More RNG or as little as possible?",self,t5_2wp64,1366895642.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Banished/comments/1d2txp/how_much_random_number_generation_will_there_be/

Really though, slow down, change the format a bit? Anything goes, I want the criticism!

I was thinking there could be a longer term apprentice style program such that the quality/output of the villager increases each year from 33/66/100% from the 1st to 3rd years as they are taught. After three years they graduate



I'm not sure what would happen if you do not have someone that has mastered a profession.  Perhaps they would be a novice, as they teach others, their students would take what they learn, plus learn more on their own terms, so now 75-95% or so.  This would mean after 3 or so generations, you would finally have a true master (100% productivity) in the profession that could teach others to the max potential.



There can also be bonuses to this too

1364171334.0,1axzrz,Thoughts on Graphical Style,Shiroi_Kage,18,5,10,"I'm really loving what I've seen so far of this game. It looks like a relaxed medieval-settlement simulator that does not involve combat

The one thing that's a bit bothering me, but more the lack of variety in the color pallet. I think that the menus can be more than just grey and the farms can have more color added to them.

The reason this bothers me a bit is that in such games the player is going to be staring at the town for quite a while

Do you think it would benefit the game by allowing us to mod the game and create our own ideas to add what we personly like.  Example some people hate combat while others want it so a modder could had a combat system to the game and let other people download it.
