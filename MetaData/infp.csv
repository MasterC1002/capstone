1. I will sometimes pretend I’m having a conversation with someone (either  a  fictional character or a real person) and imagine how it would go (I actually talk aloud in my head sometimes). 

2. Music can very easily affect my mood. Sometimes I can go from joyful to melancholic to excited within 10 minutes because of 3 different melodies.  If it’s happy music, mountains..etc.) while the music plays and I may even hop around (yes, hop)  along with the music and my ideas.

3. On the subject of hopping around

4.  The people I have the hardest time dealing with (I’m usually pretty laid-back and accept everyone as they come) are close-minded people who judge people every chance they get. The second thing would be people who never ask themselves why they do something or have 0 curiosity period. The third would be people with no sense of humor at all.

5. I made another topic about this, will make me very melancholic (in a good guilty pleasure sort of way).  Hearing the sound of rain hit the window when I’m cuddled in my bed sheets is pretty much heaven for me.  I remember when I was driving home as kid with my parents I would stare at the raindrops on the car window all the time.  It would always calm me no matter what.

6.  I tend to put myself in other people’s shoes.  I try to understand their point of view by understanding their interpretation of the world. This obviously does not mean I agree with it

7.  This leads me to how I tend to meet new people. I like asking  questions about them instead of talking about me (or let them talk about themselves without necessarily asking questions). Sometimes it can go so far that I might give the impression I really like the person when in fact I’m just curious. This is why sometimes people are surprised I may remember details from a very old conversation because of how my questions were sincere ( so I remember more easily).
8. When I can’t go along with someone (not necessarily because I ‘’hate’’ the person, calling me a ‘’loser’’ or ‘’no-life’’ (she is an ESFP so you can imagine how her lifestyle is much different than mine...).

9. I tend to write too much if the subject interests me. Often. Like this list (I actually had to force myself to stop writing). I was only planning to write 3-4 brief points. And I’m too lazy to tl;dr everything.

**i. The MBTI Disclaimer**

[Here's](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aQ2QbS-EgrM) a nice starting platform.

MBTI is based off of a series of ‘cognitive functions’ which Carl Jung coined when he observed and categorized typical (general) human behavior. MBTI is merely but a manifestation of these functions. Counter-intuitively, true personality psychology is so much richer than MBTI that many psychologists and sociologists regard the system as utterly useless—astrological. I’ve had a few people tell me to stop ‘wasting my time’ with Myers-Briggs, as it ‘ultimately damaging to my understanding of the complexity of human personality’.

But I’m not one of those people; I think there is some merit to MBTI. My personal experience has proven that to be so. There is a lot of parallel between people. Many INFPs are indeed idealistic, for example, that Introverted Feeling (Fi—the dominant function in IxFPs) tends to evoke personality traits such as rich idealism, just as Extroverted Thinking (Te—the inferior function in IxFPs) tends to manifest itself as ‘bouncy’ thought patterns. But tendency does not equal absolution!

I strongly recommend against solely reading horoscope-like type descriptions to type yourself because of how incredibly general they are. Given, and vice versa. Sometimes type descriptions are actually very true.

My advice to those of you interested in MBTI is to take everything with many grains of salt. Be smart, though you may think otherwise. Give yourself more credit. You are a unique individual and nobody else is like you. Don’t fall into the trap of trying to become what your type description says you are. 

However, not a define-all.

Anyway

**ii. Common Misconceptions / FAQ**

Q: I keep getting different results every time I take the test. Why is this?

A: Firstly, or INFP depending on which tests I’ve taken and at what times in my life. Secondly, most of the online tests are completely bogus and awful. Just look at some of the questions—does being prone to be late or always on time seem like a valid indicator of type preference? No, certainly not. My advice is to take the actual MBTI exam. Seek out the nearest career counseling center and take the real test. Thirdly, and most importantly, mood and other environmental factors play a big role in your type result. In a depressed or altered mood, the inferior function (see the function analysis below for more information) tends to surface more. An INFP might score as an INTP if he takes the MBTI test in a really shitty mood.

Q: I feel as if I’m two different personality types—a hybrid. I feel that I’m both INFP and INFJ. Is this possible?

A: No. If you look at the functions which define the INFP and the INFJ, or use up more energy. As an INFP, strong Extrovert Feelers like the ESFJ or ENFJ tend to drain me very quickly with their powerful Fe. I can only handle so much of their outward emotionality before getting really exhausted. In this respect, I cannot be both INFJ and INFP, because Fe is one of my ‘shadow’ functions, a function that does not come naturally to me, and one that drains me. Do some research on shadow functions

Q: I’m either INTP or INFP. I feel that both describe me well. Which one is really me?

A: I think you’ve been spending too much time reading the horoscope type-descriptions. The MBTI framework does not allow for either/or. You are one type, you cannot be either/or. The differences between the INFP and INTP are huge. Look at the functions! An INFP has dominant Fi, while the INTP has inferior Fe. And guess what? You can’t have both Fi and Fe. You are only one personality type. Read about and master the Jungian functions, and you will come to understand what your natural preferences are—the functions you use, and in what order. 

Q: I’ve scored as INFP, and I find that no INFP type descriptions sum me up very well. Why is that?

A: Here’s what I’ve tried to cover in the disclaimer. MBTI is horribly general. You can be INFP and be a mathematician. You can be INFP and be an Olympic athlete. You can be INFP and be very outgoing and expressive. You can be whatever the hell you want to be. And you can certainly be entirely different from what your type description says. Humans are complex creatures. There is no perfect framework. Don’t be discouraged if none of the traditional type descriptions match you word for word. I assure you that you fit somewhere in MBTI

Q: I’m either extroverted or introverted. I can’t figure out which. Help!

A: Everyone is both introverted and extroverted. Everyone holds two functions that engage the internal world

Q: You claim that type description pages are generally bad to focus on. But what about the functions? Aren’t descriptions of the functions just as general?

A: Well, you can start to actually see it in real life. You start to develop your own categorizations. It’s sometimes hard to describe the functions in theory because more often than not they’re more complex than basic terminology offers. But just like you didn’t know what a squirrel looked like until you actually saw one, you don’t really know what Te looks like until you actually can see and identify it. After you’ve reached that point, it becomes second-nature. Function descriptions don’t really do the functions much justice. The same goes for types. Once you identify one or two of them, you really start to see them all over the place.

Q: I think MBTI is bogus. Can you convince me otherwise?

A: In my experience, to get on their ‘wavelength’ with ease. Trust me, this effect is real.

Q: You seem pretty arrogant. I think you’re stupid

A: Hey, I’m just trying to help! :)

**iii. Extroversion vs. Introversion**

Too often I see people comparing extroversion to outgoingness and introversion to shyness. This couldn’t be further from the truth. You can be a shy extrovert, but the degree of social comfort is no indicator of extroversion or introversion.

Extroversion and introversion can best be thought of in terms of what energizes you. As we will see later, you have a natural preference for either introversion or extroversion. As an INFP, think of what charges you. For me, thinking about the future—dreaming of what’s to come, perceiving a bright, colorful future—really empowers me. I could sit around all day (and have) just thinking about such things. I naturally gravitate toward internal concerns, and as such

I’ve noticed that when I’m forced to be the feature of attention, they become excessively drained. They need that external action—they feed off it.

I find it excruciatingly difficult to locate people who are like me (partially because I don't really go out and search), yet people perceive me as being at least 23-24 very regularly. Apparently I 'present myself as someone older'. I like this about myself, yet it is the cause of many concerns. For one, people in my age group generally annoy me to no end. The triviality of their conversations and interests is overwhelmingly disappointing. I'm not a typical college student. I don't care for partying &amp; promiscuity, 'breezing through school', playing team sports, or being a part of large social events. I want to sit down with one person every once in awhile, more 'grandiose' things. Triviality is literally physically painful. It exhausts me.

I've posted about this before, and I still have not managed to get myself out there much and find people who truly demonstrate friend material. Next semester is likely to change as my living situation is going to be much more 'me', however for now I have to somehow manage...

Previous suggestions have been: clubs &amp; activities, etc.-- all of which I've given a chance. But people continue to disappoint me. I wish someone could just take hold of me, shake me violently and tell me to man the fuck up and put myself out there-- find people and stop being timid.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Dominant: Introverted Feeling (Fi)**

""I know just how you feel--I've felt just the same way when that happened to me

The INFP's dominant Fi is an introverted judgment (Ji) function, robust, profound definition of precisely what values the user finds instrumental to the essence of his personal identity and that which he finds to be fundamentally ""good"" or ""bad"" at its root core. But it's more than just good or bad; on a grander scale, the INFP is concerned with the very essence of Good and Evil, Meaningful and Not Meaningful, Sacred and Not Sacred. This duality becomes central to the moral philosophy of many Fi dominant types.

Fi users believe there is a definite moral order to the universe (meaning that it is inescapably true that some things and some ideas are inherently more valuable, and that the only way we may catch a glimpse of this sacred ideal is by allowing ourselves complete and total connection and understanding with our emotional responses and the way they reflect that which upholds the internal ""essence"" of moral goodness as we understand it subjectively and individually. One INFP friend calls it ""The uh oh feeling"" when his Fi (bolstered by Si) somehow ""senses"" almost immediately that a new person is up to no good.

For Fi

Morality for Fi is not something that anyone else can tell you how to approach: it's something you just have to look inside and feel for yourself. Morality is too complex and nuanced, too subject to that individual's experiences and understanding to even be approached (or worse, insisted upon) by anyone else. As soon as you try to design moral philosophy that works the same way for more than one person, you've ruined its inherently individualistic nature.

INFPs often have a distinct habit of letting resentment and negativity build up toward someone until they're so incredibly upset that they can't help exploding into a Te-rundown of precisely everything you are doing wrong and why it's simply not acceptable in moral terms they can justify (Fi.) At least two INFP friends have told me that when they focus on explaining and resolving their grievances routinely and calmly before they have time to bottle up and fester into huge issues

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Auxiliary: Extroverted iNtuition (Ne)**

As an auxiliary function, create, experiment, and play with new combinations and possibilities for different approaches and ways to change and recreate what they see around them, with an eye on how these exploratory outings will affect the perceptions and emotional states of others.

This is a crucial factor in the INFP's ability to apply Fi's uniquely individualistic values to an externally observable context in a way that both captures the attention and admiration of others and allows him to translate his inner passions into forms that others can understand

""No need for greed or hunger / A brotherhood of man / Imagine all the people / Sharing all the world.""
--John Lennon

Ne often ends up expressing itself through artistic and creative endeavors: This penchant for interpreting and rearranging patterns of external phenomena frequently results in a particular knack for manipulation of language and its ability to say just the right thing to convey precisely the value or feeling the INFP wants to express, musicians, graphic artists, screen writers, and all other forms of widely recognized creative expression by which the purity of their internal worlds (Fi) can be expressed externally (Ne).

At their best, playful, creative, and deeply empathetic. Without the aid of auxiliary Ne, the INFP may become frustrated at the conflict between her intense desire for self-expression and her inability to translate the ideals she strives to live by into a medium that will touch the souls of others in the same way they define the meaning and purpose of her own life.

INFPs, and indeed they will remain that way as long as their interactions with you remain relaxed and enjoyable and do not require getting into serious ethical analysis or put them in any uncomfortable situations which might make them feel morally conflicted. They will appear flexible now (Ne), and steadfast later (Fi). They are generally open to all sorts of new experiences and connections between different experiences--they love to get at the heart of the people's true character by finding and comparing the ways in which different individuals have different unique ""flavors"", each offering its own special kind of meaning, and they love to observe the connections between different individuals in this regard. They may come off as rather reserved at first, but it doesn't take too long before they will at least open up Ne to you and relate to you on a surface level--this usually happens in terms of discussion about some common interest, such as art, music

Inside, you are accepting a responsibility to uphold the high personal standards that define the INFP's entire self-image and existential philosophy. INFPs will offer only the very best ethical treatment of their friends and loved ones, and they expect no less in return--if you cannot fulfill this sacred bond to the same level they hold themselves to, you should not commit to such a close relationship in the first place.

**Tertiary: Introverted Sensation (Si)**

For INFPs, the last time this happened it caused a negative emotional reaction for me; therefore I will avoid it now""; Fi simply instinctively begins to experience the terrible emotional state Si has associated with whatever negative experience, and panic and dread take over, forcing the INFP to escape this situation at all costs, for fear of being forced into that state again. Fool me once, shame on you--fool me twice, shame on me.

I have seen INFPs who, has the right nutritional content, etc. Some of them either insist on seeing a doctor more often than necessary, or become distrustful of doctors in general and avoid the experience, if they've had some negative past experience with doctors or medication (as, unfortunately, a fair number of INFPs have.) When applied positively though, something they can hold on to that they know will always be there for them because it always has been--this can be instrumental in leading the INFP into the spiritually aware and comfortable state she desires.

Development of tertiary Si helps the INFP connect her physical health and the needs of her body to the emotional and spiritual health upon which Fi is so heavily focused. As INFPs learn to pay more attention to Si, they will appear to take a page from ISJs in their refusal to work under conditions that ""don't feel right"" in that they aren't conducive to promoting the calm, relaxed, and emotionally aware state under which their creative juices can flow most freely.

Most importantly, more world-weary, and perhaps a little bit more cynical--but it's generally for the best, as repeated negative experiences with being too trusting too quickly will teach them.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Inferior: Extroverted Thinking (Te)**

For INFPs

Te will, because she wants so badly to respect others' right to personal individuality and self-expression, but ultimately she must recognize that some people will not voluntarily cooperate and must be forced to change for the good of society as a whole--nay, for the Good of Good itself!

As far as I can tell the line of reasoning goes something like this: ""You are not performing your moral duty to me as a friend (Fi), you are threatening my right to personal identity here (Fi) and thus I must explain to you objectively and very, very bluntly how your behavior cannot be tolerated (Te).""

The real issue for INFPs struggling with inferior Te is the conflict between Fi's idealistic, once Fi, Ne, and Si are satisfied, an INFP nearing total maturity should be able to recognize the value in the idea that sometimes, unconditional promotion of individual freedom of expression is simply not practical from a resource management standpoint, and that in order for society (or any other organization) to function meaningfully as a unit, at times

Nonetheless, namely some form of objectively impersonal evaluation, and that this doesn't have to conflict with their ideals--it can, in fact, support and assist them in their quest to set all things right with the world.

* Very minimal contact with external ""customers""
* Very consistent workload from day to day. I don't like being far ahead on work one day
* Positive work environment. Seems like a ""duh"" comment but a lot companies I've worked for have very ""by the books"" policies about how they want things done and any and all suggestions you have for process improvements are immediately shot down or fly up the chain of command and vanish never to be followed-up on.
* NO micromanagement. Hate when companies want something done in the exact steps of 1, 4, 5. I want to be able to see the problem, find a solution, and do it in my own way to allow the creative side of my brain to work. And I'm not 5 years old, I am responsible enough to make my own rationale decisions about what needs to be done when problems arise. Don't like when everything has to be reviewed by management first before it can be implemented.
* Work environment must promote creativity and allow me to produce my own projects that I feel will help the company.
* Job needs to be emotionally rewarding to my soul. Needs to be something that makes me feel like I actually have a positive influence on the world. Not just a ""it pays the bills"" job.
* Needs to be able to pay my bills - absolutely nothing less than $35-40K per year.

I feel inspired to explore something I've struggled with for a while now. As I'm sure most of you can relate, security and emotional tranquility but there is a side of me that longs for variety. 
	One of the most pivotal moments of my personal journey came once while I was listening to a lecture given by the daughter of Buckminster Fuller on the difference between artists and academics. It was my last year of college when I heard this
	I struggle with feeling idle in my life, thinking of the world going on and I'm plagued with guilt for not living up to my fullest potential. Traveling has always quelled these anxieties, as well as sharing trips with close friends. 
	I've had a tremendous passion for photography for many years because of this feeling. When I travel or go on little adventures with friends and I come home with a collection of photos that I feel really validate my experiences, my very being feels validated. When I stray from it, I feel empty. Photography has always been a way for me to rediscover this world. However, I get panicked when I feel like the security I long for seems to stamp out some smoldering internal fire that sends up smoke to lure me home.

There's lots of things I want to accomplish in my life. The main one right now is an independent oldschool RPG that I and some associates have been gradually developing for years now. It's really the only thing I look forward to right now, and then maybe I'll make use of my degree for another one or two years, before throwing all of that effort out to focus on game design.

If that's the case, at least) be less financially crippling. I really have difficulty convincing myself that school is even worthwhile in that case. So many people say that everyone changes their job at some point or another, so, again, why not cut out the middle man and not even bother throwing your money away at that degree? I'm being impractical, I'm sure - but I've been in a very somber mood as of late. You need a job, and money, because either way I don't know how much I'm going to care ten years from now.

A more personal example. I'm at a point in life where I'm thinking of returning to art. Pursuing a general BA in Visual Arts at my school. I don't know what kind specifically, but for me it's like a drug, the only thing in my life that I still strive to improve in, and the only thing left that completely captivates me and gives me that focus and childlike whimsy that I seldom feel in day-to-day doings.

I've been practicing drawing regularly all summer, but have never had anyone truly demand anything of me. Now I'm in college and have to decide. And I attempt to look five/ten years down the line, where I'd be if I simply devoted most of my efforts to art, and I just don't know if I can do it.

I'm not sure how much of that is self-doubt

I don't know what it is, for fear that 5 years down the line I'll discard it and it'll have been wasted time that I could've spent on something that would get me more success and repute.

Not to say I necessarily want that, and yet I just don't understand - is this the normal mode of living for people? It seems so...dishonest. And I lack the drive to commit to anything, so I wouldn't even know.

Last year

I'll keep it short and get to the modern day. I can't look at DeviantArt's front page or that of communities like FiMFiction. Because everytime I do, so much that I have to leave the site before it just breaks me down. My best friend/bromance wants me to get back on the saddle with him, so we can write and draw and learn together. After a few nights of bad fighting and me being resistant, he coaxed me into reading a story on FiMFiction for the first time in a year. After I got over my defense mechanism of caustic criticism, I began enjoying it, and it's advanced to where I want to get back to writing so I can rank myself among the great authors of the internet. 

But now I want to go further. I want to break my nearly endless cycle of considering, and quitting because I feel like I can never succeed, that everyone else will always be better than me. It's been hurting my best friend to see me in such an emotional mess, and we care about each other deeply; He doesn't want me hurt, but he doesn't want to enable my self-destructive habits anymore.

I hold a very boring job to get me through college. In my department, boring, keep-yourself-busy type work. I have been at this job for three years, meaning of all the people currently in the department, I've been there the longest. I often wonder why it is that I stayed when so many other people obviously couldn't handle it, and I think the answer is that I have a natural tendency to retract myself into my own thoughts when I'm bored. For people who don't do a lot of thinking and would rather be ""doing things,"" I could see how my job might suck for them. But for me

It's not to say that I enjoy work

Sometimes I'll come up with ideas, Etc.) or set goals for myself when I get home, like ""I should play this game,"" or ""research this topic,"" Etc. That seems pretty straight-foward, though - I'm sure a lot of people spanning many personality types do that.

Another thing I've noticed, I believe, originated due to the boredom of this job mixed with the fact that I'm an English/film major and thus have exposure to a lot of literature and movies that contain this type of monologue. What I mean by monologue is that in my head, it sounds as if I'm writing my thoughts down into a novel written in the first person.  An example might be something like, ""I noticed three girls heading toward me.  One of them was wearing a red shirt, but it was an interesting tone of red, one which I was not accustomed to seeing very often which threw me off guard. By the way they were dressed, but can also be about events that had passed, but if I think as if I *were* writing, so then I have to go back and try to fill them in. Sometimes I'm successful

So that's one interesting quirk of mine.. another one I have is probably going to come off as even weirder. But, so here goes: I often imagine that in some parallel universe, the events of my life are portrayed in a book/TV show/movie/comic series/Etc. I spend a *lot* of time thinking about this, just to pass the time. First and foremost, my life is so boring that no one, ever, would watch/read such a thing.. I'm aware of that. However, this isn't a recent endeavor.. I've done this for as long as I can remember. I remember doing it as a kid.. It's not wonder I developed an interest for film/story telling

Anyway.. One thing I might think about is what actors from our universe would best portray people in my life. I have a couple for this, I used to work with a girl that reminded me a lot of Gillian Jacobs from Community, so I figured she'd be the best bet. I also work with a grumpy old man that I feel could easily be portrayed, quite humorously, by J. K. Simmons. I imagine what this ""show"" would be like, and how, if I were producing it, and if it's name carries any significant meaning to the show overall, and I feel very strange for having never grown out of it - but the thing is, if only to a group of people that don't actually exist..

There's some major misconceptions around here that need to be cleared up.,omarfw,29,7,12,"First off, but has massive problems if one takes it too seriously. There are definitely similarities between all INFPs but they are far from all alike.

The MBTI is just a dumbed down archetype of the Jungian cognitive functions which are far more legitimate. They allow for variance and encourage one to look at the building blocks of their personality as something that can be improved upon

The MBTI does not even begin to scratch the surface of my personality nor does it yours and you should not treat it like some kind of all encompassing category that you cannot escape the bindings of.

Allow me to explain what being an INFP really means.

**Introvert** - This does not equate to social behavior of any kind. Our introversion originates from our dominant function being Fi or 'Introverted Feeling'. This function deals with the formation of ethics and principles. We project these internal principles onto the external world in the form of judgment. Since we are Fi dominant

**How does this apply to life?** - INFPs are labeled anti-social when really we are just selective. I do not enjoy 'raw' social interaction with people I don't know. I would much prefer hanging out with people that I have had time to 'evaluate' appropriately and when someone subjects social interaction upon me without my consent I become anxious. We are 'judgement before interaction' and many people out there are the exact opposite so they see people like us being quiet and assume we must dislike social interaction when that is not true. If I don't like someone
As far as Introverts needing time by themselves

*Do not label yourself an anti-social person unless you legitimately shun all forms of socialization. It is not inherent to being an introvert or an INFP.*

**iNtuitor** - Our intuition originates from our auxiliary Ne function or 'Extraverted Intuition' which is our primary source of interaction with external things. Ne deals with finding all of the different external possibilities in both in the short term and long term sense. Coupled with the idealistic tendencies of dominant Fi

**How does this apply to life?** - Being able to go through each feasible possibility is useful and keeps us open-minded but it can be hindering during conversation when we are expected to give an answer to someone. While our Ne is still going through possible answers, we are 'perfectionistic' conversationalists which isn't something that works well in a society dominated by small talk. Because of this the world labels us as socially inept when they really just don't understand the thought process happening in our heads. This is why many of us tend to be better at writing as writing gives us the time we require to get everything we want to say just right. The same applies to things like online forms of communication which are not real-time.
Ne helps us be creative and very open-minded but when it dwarfs our entire perception we can submerge ourselves in these possibilities too much which can potentially lead to depression or anxiety. The presence of an potential undesirable situation

*It is not some kind of psychic power and sensors are not somehow happier or less intelligent than you. They just prefer to think in the now

**Feeler** - Like I said before, I want to help spread this knowledge to other INFPs to help them which is why I'm willing to sit here and type up this much shit on Reddit at 4am. That is a choice I made based on my ethics. Any emotions I feel as a result of my past are a side effect, not a cause or motivation.

**How does this apply to life?** - When I am sad I do not ever want to ignore that sadness in exchange for happiness because I place equal importance in both as they both make up who I am equally. Therefore rather than shun my sadness, bipolar or emotionally unstable. In reality we are probably some of the most emotionally stable because we have more choice in the matter than most people, but we choose to do the opposite of what most people would choose because it makes us feel alive. We are able to be happy just as much as we are able to be sad, angry, scared etc. A truly depressed or bipolar person does not have that luxury.

*Being an Fi dominant Feeler does not make you weak

**Perceiver** - A 'Perceiver' according to the MBTI is someone who prefers to stay flexible and free of constricting quotas, unnecessary organization etc. This is mostly due to the fact that we are Ne users and do not like to dedicate ourselves to only one possibility.
I can agree with this definition as it is mostly true behaviorally but it also implies that we are incapable of planning and doing the opposite which is not true. We may have to learn how to do that
We adapt ourselves to things as we go because we know that planning for only one set of potential issues can lead to us following through incorrectly sometimes. Calenders and schedules do not allow for 'What if?'

What being a perceiver means from a Jungian standpoint is more significant. For example

INFP - Fi Ne Si Te|Fe Ni Se Ti

INFJ - Ni Fe Ti Se|Ne Fi Te Si

As you can see, not absolutely all of them.

&gt;The INTP may be prone to abandoning a project once they have figured it out

&gt;The INTP is usually very independent, and may tend to be restless and temperamental. They are strongly ingenious, and have unconventional thought patterns which allows them to analyze ideas in new ways.

&gt;INTPs value knowledge above all else. Their minds are constantly working to generate new theories, and able to be objectively critical in their analysis. They love new ideas

Let me introduce myself - I've considered myself an IN*P for several years and only recently stumbled upon this subreddit. This isn't my main account and I primarily use it for bemoaning my existence on /r/depression but it seems that this subreddit is more in line with the sorts of things that continue to elude me.

I've always had lots of hobbies and interests throughout my life. As a kid, woodworking and a smattering of other miscellaneous things which make my friends regard me like some sort of weird at-ease retired 60 year old who has too much time to themselves. In high school I wanted to be an architect, before shifting towards artwork and then writing. Now after almost an entire year of college (a liberal arts university), I'm appalled with how narrow-minded and lackadaisical everybody is around here and sincerely wish I were in art school, or learning a trade, or really in any sort of environment with thoughtful individuals that act with a sense of virtue and conviction. I still come home every other week or so, because I really have yet to find any geniunely interesting people around here that simply enjoy talking about philosophy

That is to say, to be honest. Sometimes I think that it's futile for me to ever attempt to commit to one particular thing, and often I think I'd be content working any old job so long as it availed me the time and money to allow me to pursue what truly interests me. In school I was always regarded as a bright kid, but now I feel somewhat pathetic as my contemporaries actually acted on their abilities, got girlfriends, went to Ivy Leagues, whilst I've been stretching myself thin trying to accommodate for every opportunity and possibility as to what direction my life may ultimately take

My other weakness is my obsession with the past - historical, lively settings. Then there's the more realistic angle to it. My dad's a baby boomer, so I've grown up on lots of bucolic stories about him spending time on his uncle's farm in the 1950s and what have you. I love everything about the past - whether it's old movies, music, even early color photography. It all has this warmth about it, and whilst I know the past wasn't any more perfect than the present day is, a part of me loves it. Maybe it's because of how people back then were portrayed as so disciplined and moral, that's for certain.

I'm not sure what it is, that I really like.

I've kind of gone off-topic here and I apologize for what is a rather disorganized post (but perhaps this better reflects how disorganized and indescribable I feel about my life sometimes).

1363074696.0,1a4yii,"From Dexter's Lab: ""What is the purpose of meaning?""",,19,1,12,"A year or so ago

&gt;Well, despite DeeDee's methods on paper, this is not a logical problem. That's good. I was always shit at logic puzzles. 

&gt;The purpose of meaning... The function of the perceived significance or insignificance of a given noun... I say ""function"" rather than ""end"" because it's got less finality than ""end."" End, when most things (worthwhile ones, at least) have *at least* one. That, and even though I know what it means, ""the end of meaning"" fucks with my head because ""end"" has multiple meanings itself. Okay, back to the question, hopefully. 

&gt;I think that the function of meaning is to give us some sort of clue as to what is truly important. While something with a very deep meaning is not always important, otherwise, be little more than a lump of inorganic matter. When you see a piece of art, the first question besides ""Why can't I do that?"" is often ""What the hell is that supposed to mean?"" 

&gt;We, but it's so close that me might as well ask ""Why do we wonder why?"" Because, in my eyes at least, in finding the answer to that question, we will get an answer so close to the answer to this one that all that's required to convert them is a small pocket thesaurus (am I the only one who wished that was a dinosaur as a kid?) 

&gt;I could cop out and say ""to satisfy our innate curiosity, as I am wont to do, and the answer is staring me right in the face, as *you* are wont to do (***note: she was. She had big eyes that could bore into your soul***) 

&gt;Maybe the purpose of meaning is to give *us* a sense of purpose, couldn't quite do their jobs perfectly. If we attribute meaning to everything in our lives, it makes us seem less like a vast cosmological coincidence and more like something which, itself, has meaning. 

&gt;Maybe the purpose of meaning is an illusion, try as I might, I just can't bring myself to throw away. ""What if I'm gonna end up needing this later?"" I always ask, as if one day there might come the Bread Tie Apocalypse, the end of fresh-baked goods as we know it, and I will be the only one with the foresight to have saved up a few precious, precious wires covered in paper. 

&gt;The purpose of meaning gives us a purpose of our own,"" we would be no different from the vast clouds of other chaotically-bound molecules drifting through the ether. I may be paraphrasing a bit, but I once heard someone say ""Given enough time, a hydrogen atom will begin to think about itself."" I think that about sums it up. We are the aggregate of billions of years' worth of totally random collisions and explosions and irradiations that, somehow, learned how to question, to desire

&gt;And I think it's mostly our imaginations that are asking this question, without this nagging insistence that behind every event, there is a reason, an explanation, then we would have to come to terms with the fact that we ourselves have no purpose, no meaning, no function.

It seems as though when he has time to write a letter, or he just gets bewildered.

Basically, which is somewhat hard when even he cannot seem to do that!

I'm eighteen years old and have no idea what to do with my life. I've always been attentive enough that I could excel in my schoolwork without effort, but have never really decided what I enjoy the most.

I love fictional worlds - both the writing and artwork that go into them. I've spent a lot of time modding video games and doing level design, with its subtle aesthetics and atmosphere, or get carried away by becoming more enamored with the story and the histories behind it. Kind of like world building for RPGs and D&amp;D campaigns, which is another thing I've done on occasion but never thought much about.

It's also a matter of heartfulness. I have friends who are writers, or study theory or practice technique. Hard to say if that implies more or less passion - it could go either way. On one hand, writing comes very naturally to me and it can be quite difficult to restrain myself from getting caught up in lengthy diatribes and fanciful short stories. On the other, I don't go crazy over the prospect of having to write. A part of me thinks I may only write to impress people - my artwork is the opposite. It's entirely for myself, and I've seldom felt any compulsion to seek praise from others for it. But I'd have to spend more time developing it.

Perhaps I'm simply over/undervaluing it. I know one needn't try and incorporate everything they're good at into their daily life

I have very little foundation in conventional art. I'd consider myself better at it than the average person, the painted backgrounds of old cartoons and adventure games - they've this air of character about them, and evoke in me a certain, indescribable sense of almost melancholic longing about the way things used to be and always ought to have been. There's a certain majesty to be felt in the sheer face of the adventure, and the resolve of the characters who move about in them. I want to live among these worlds. They speak to me more powerfully than anything in real life does.

I don't know what I'd enjoy studying more in the long term. I've never really received formal schooling in either, articles) but few others. I feel more like a craftsperson who has focused on a few specific aspects of these things that interest him, rather than an educated individual who could develop basic ability in any direction. Which is problematic for the wroking world and all that, as you can imagine.

I feel as though writing can always be done on the side - and art is the only ""honest"" thing for me to study. But for all I know

Sometimes I think maybe I'm just overanalyzing myself. But I've been growing increasingly disinterested in school and withdrawing more into my own projects - few of my friends can relate to this,,False,self,t5_2qn2o,False,,True

My best friend in the whole wide world is an INFP (I made him take a test). I want to know how he's feeling because he doesn't talk much about himself (Fi). No drama or anything


Me and him met high school. I can't recall exactly how I met him but we weren't particularly close in high school, but it was still arms distance from what I recall.

After high school, we'd climb and just talk all day. Go to the beach and talk. Go to a hill and talk. I found I agreed with him on almost every major view from politics to philosophy to religion to you name it. 

I think one of the key turning points was when I came out to him over the internet. The moment is etched permanently into my memory. He was the first person I told and it was a year before I came out to anyone else. He was so important in my life that I couldn't bear to have him not see the *true me*. In the days prior I was thinking about it constantly in my head, etc. I had typed out the sentence (""I want to tell you I'm gay"" or something) and sat there for probably forty minutes just too nervous to hit enter. I hit enter and literally ran away from my computer because I was afraid of what he would say. In the end he warmly accepted me like I knew he would. 

Somewhere around here I started crushing on him pretty hard like gay people tend to with straight people. I don't know what it is, but he probably knew. Eventually I got over him but not before some pretty awkward moments. 

It's now a few years out of high school and we are closer than ever. I've learned so much from him. He probably kindled a kind of deep-seated spirituality in me. He understands me better than I understand myself. I've never met someone with as much depth and empathy as him. He just seems so much more ""real"" than anyone else. I rely on him a lot for emotional support. To be *seen* by him just feels so ... right. 

This feeling of being completely and perfectly understood is so strong that I wish everyone, and this really used to weigh heavily on me. I felt that he didn't really get much out of our friendship, but I've been instructed otherwise. Am I really that thick? Whatever I give him - my ideas? my confidence? - he has told me as such that it really is equal. I guess whatever he ""gets"" out of our relationship I must give without even thinking. Is it the same for you guys? 

It seems that just as my intuitions (Ni) are reserved and I wouldn't feel comfortable talking about them, what is it like from your perspective? What is going through my best friend's head?

INFP-""the martyr""- This type tends to sacrifice themselves in an effort to promote their peculiar sense of truth.

INPF-""jesus christ""-Like a more refined version of ""the martyr

IFNP-""cat hotel""-This isolation-prone subtype tends to idealize simplicity and a-rationality.

IFPN-""the hoarder""- A combination of strong sensory and feeling preference makes this type prone to collecting various objects to symbolize emotional states and periods in time.

IPFN-""bathtime""-The combination of a highly fluid identity and relative sensory preference in this type means they like an inordinate quantity of alone time.

IPNF-""commonlaw""-Stasis and apathy tends to overwhelm this subtype. Often mistaken for an INTP.

N-type- ""the manipulators""

NIPF-""master of puppets""- This type is very adept at creating concord or discord

NIFP-""guilt trip""- Much like the NIPF

NFIP-""journey of shame""-This subtype is like a more extraverted ""guilt trip""

NFPI- ""performance artist""-This type almost always manifests as a ""journey of shame"" gone too far. They usually only succeed in making other people uncomfortable.

NPFI-""the zen seminar disruptor""-A bit like an F version of their NPTI cousins, maaaan.""

NPIF-""the zookeeper""-Eerily close to their NPIT counterparts

P-type-""the daydreamers""

PINF-""The false INTP""-With a strong feeling about the possibilities for their identity

PIFN- ""The angry aesthete""- Tying their identity to art

PFIN-""Elliot Smith""-This type dominates the group of INFPs that are most likely to become poets and songwriters.

PFNI-""Stevie Nicks""-More extraverted than PFINs, it's usually artistic.

PNFI-""Totorro""- This type knows that the possibility for dreamy cuddles is endless. Just don't piss it off.

PNIF-""Bukowski""-I told you not to piss Totorro off. 

F-type-""the nurturers""

FINP- ""the moralist""- The SJ of the INFP universe

FIPN-""the veterinarian""- Healers in every sense of the word

FNIP-""snuggie""- This type is always trying to find simple solutions to the emotional turmoil in people's lives. Once they find the solution

FNPI-""cuddle puddle""-This nurturer tends to use its very personality as an emotional ointment for the troubles of their subject.

FPIN-""fursuit""- This subtype is preoccupied with the possibilities for refined emotions. This can lead it to a variety of novel solutions for self- and group-expression.

FPNI-""care bear""- A less refined version of the ""fursuit

I've felt a sort of almost supernatural connection with all of my favorite artists because I knew that they had expressed fully those wild, and when other people failed me or disappointed me, i'd always look to them for words of wisdom, guidance, and reassurance that I wasn't going insane, or at the very least, that I wasn't the first to go insane. 

Now that I know that most of my very favorite artists are indeed INFP's it all makes a lot of sense that I naturally gravitate towards them. And now that I know that INFP's run rare in society (often being the antithesis of society's ideal) and that I know nobody else who is one

Due to romantic complications that were entirely my fault, but on another level, even the hurting makes me realize my heart isn't of stone after all.

This document shall serve as a summary of my current mental state of being sixteen years old. I already gave you the tl;dr

You may ask: why are you making this public? Well... I always believed in openness. I don't have many things to hide

I... Don't know where to start. I never really could find any means of contact with my peers. They have delight in stupid jokes and fighting teachers... I like teachers. Often, which is very valuable.

I feel lonely. I am ambivalent

I am a heavy individualist. I often have different opinions than ""the group"". I get annoyed often

I'm also a programmer, as well as my general life...

What do I want? Development, improve my coding, writing... It would make for a lot of useful and practical skills.

But! (Note: The order is quite random)

* I am very lazy. Insanely so... It's procrastination. Few people care about my opinion. School and nurture has ruined my ability to gratify myself for good work
* I am jealous. Of people who have spent less - or more - effort into creating something wonderful. Of people whose ideas are beautiful. Of people who do things I can't... Jealousy has killed my soul.
* I don't feel creative. Although I have a lot of ideas
* I lack IRL companions. I have a few
* I get annoyed very easily. It causes mental pain in the long run.
* I am most productive in the morning times. But I'm stuck in school then. Evenings are when I get lazy
* My brain is a habitual pessimist. I am used to seeing the worst possible turn of events
* I cannot easily pick ideas. I keep thinking which one is a better effort to spend my valuable time on.
* I overthink. I desire being able to just do. Create. Play. Have fun. Overthinking made me lose my enjoyment of things.
* I cannot form habits and I forget things. It takes weeks of reminder in order to finally do something other people want me to. For myself
* I want to try a lot of new things but don't do any. I feared failing
* I daydream too much. It causes that I see the big picture as really well-defined, despite attempts to focus on the small steps, because i keep seeing how much work is left.
* Most of my ideas are large. The small ones are usually already done.
* I never felt hard work turn out awesome. Therefore
* Cannot gratify myself

UPDATE after discussing it with others:

* Self-doubt. Yeah.
* I am impatient. Due to my innate skills of collecting information I never had to work hard. And I need to research, to get anywhere. It sucks.

UPDATE 2:

I was bullied for a long time in primary school (which lasts 6 years, like, literally.

* I want my empathy back
* I want to run a community. Sadly
* I'm not responsible enough. As I said

UPDATE 3:

* Poor time management.

UPDATE 4:

* I seek someone to appreciate what I do. It's hard.

UPDATE 5:

* I am jealous of other people's successes and ideas. Heavily.

What I seek is solutions. Solutions to my problems. I know this document means any future employer will never hire me. They will find it somehow. But I do not care. Honesty is more important than societal ways of living a life.

PS. Workarounds are also fine. I know some of these problems will pass with age

That’s a question that I don’t think a lot of people really consider and spend their precious time agonizing over. They may

I’ve always felt detached from the us, as all of them filtered about in the world acting according to their character. I could see their strengths and their flaws and watch those attributes define their existence. I wonder if they could see those as well. I wonder if they thought about who they were. I could never understand them.

I always knew I was different. They made fun of me for it

Was I the only one who saw the world for what it was? Why was I the only one trying to fix it? What did I comprehend that which everyone else missed? Why were the masses of people I met part of the us, for I know better than anyone that my faults are too many to name. But if the us thought like me, could they look at the homeless man and claim he deserved it because he didn’t work hard enough? Could they support a war against people for the simple reason that they don’t look like the us? Could they still turn the other way as greedy businessmen and power-hungry politicians teamed up to pervert the foundations of society to suit their own selfishness? 

I only feel peace on a rainy day. I only know happiness when wrongs are righted. I only attach to people who can at least call themselves members of the them. On some days I dream of being an incendiary revolutionary, and thoughts to keep me company. I’m torn between these two, between fixing the world and forgetting it.

Who am I? On which side does my soul feel more at peace resting? How do I feel about myself? Are my thoughts a blessing or a curse?
 
Yes, every day, at the beauty at it all. I have been granted the ability to see this beauty, to understand it, to protect it. That is why it is my dearest personal mission to expose that beauty, to force the us to see what I see. It may be my secret, but it should be the beauty for all to behold. That is my mission, maybe someday I’ll find a girl who wants to join me on this walk. I don’t know whether I’ll succeed

They set expectations which instead of motivating me made me feel incompetent, further decreasing any drive I had. 

My dad tried to beat every last drop of emotion out of me by completely invalidating any feelings i tried to express to him and yelling at me when I cried. He basically taught me that feeling = weakness

My mom on the other hand was ruled by anxiety and fear. She was extremely overprotective, she did at least catch on that I was unhappy and needed help but the only solace she could give me was ""God has a way of working things out"" and sending me to a christian therapist.

I did not hear and would not listen

You brought me truth I disregarded

You made your point and stood outside

I chose to lock myself inside

To be followed is what you wanted

Fix the errors that we had planted

From inside the house was pure

Was all so sweet and demure

Cozy safe and secure

On the out it was all thorns

As if everything had been torn

Pieces placed with no real plan

Forever on the shifting sand

Peering out from our window

On the ground you cast a shadow

Come stand outside you would say

Enjoy the bright and sunny day

The ground was shifting and you stood free

Well aware you tried to help me

All your effort to no avail

I'm in my mid-twenties and have been experiencing some anger-related emotional changes these past 2-3 years. Growing up I was always very quiet, etc. I didn't get riled up easily. I could be very mean, but it was in a quiet, cuts-you-to-the-core-emotionally mean type of way. I grew out of it (thankfully), and am now in a much better, kinder, place. I help people live healthier, and am inspired by the people I meet who often have bigger problems than I and also sunnier attitudes.

Lately, and I want to scream and throw and smash things into oblivion. Before this started I don't think I'd ever seriously yelled at anyone (except that one old guy who almost ran me over with his car while I was biking), and I'd certainly never smashed something in a fit of rage. If I get into a fight with my partner, I'm likely to punch the wall, slam a door, or stomp/jump repeatedly so the whole house shakes.  

That amount of anger feels really out of character for me. I'm wondering how other INFPs deal with and experience anger, waiting for it to come out again later.

Anyway, but there is equal evidence that my Fi is incredibly strong.

I just don't seem to have the ""dreamy"" aspect that most INFPs tend to give off. I associate INFP with ""sugar, unicorns"" (think [Meet the Pyro in his ""candy land""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WUhOnX8qt3I)) and this fanciful and child-like fantasy attitude. There's nothing wrong with that, but it's not really my kind of thing. Maybe it's selection bias, though.

What I *can* relate to with INFPs is my sense of ethics and morality. I'm interested in philosophy and self-growth. I place greater value on certain things that others don't. I get strong feelings about things

There are times where I have an opportunity to say something really sentimental or emotional, but I feel like it would be too awkward to say, ""Hey, guy, I'm glad we're friends."" Basically, I'm afraid to show my sensitive side to anyone except a very select few. I consider myself really ""feely and caring"" for being a guy (in an oft-times ""alpha-male"" oriented society).

""A gentle enigma.""   

An amalgamation of outward influence and succumbing to ease of access.   
Too late to assess the situation and now must feel the consequence.   
Transgress space and time to places lined with spanning hills of green.   
Milestone homesteads all along the riverbed and eyes as wide as mountainsides.   
Under machine bearings and over serene fairings.   
Earth-glow acknowledgement.  

Pain

Softly nestled pines of information
A kind liable to ""either-or"", make a   place and leave traces of yourself upon the earth.   

Red like the morning, the setting changed like the universe does. Communion verses rang across the mind, leaving time to wallow in the deep blue, with its underwater undulations.   
Feeling communication, butterfly from centipede.  
Pulling us from islands we just let the ocean tale unfold. Let our sails run high and cold as we left the waters of our homeland.   
We came through like the universe does, or for anything else in this dark and tattered galaxy. Now I look for one to balance me and take away my silence but don't want any reliance on person place or thing, nouns fill the void, verbs add to ploys and plot can be abandoned. I can be my own stand in.   

Humanity waves are coursing
Billions bring a tired earth to convulsion   
string up power nestled in her bosom  
The sun loves us
today he showed me  
That faces mean nothing and creation leads one to all things  
Shelter under mothers wing
Meant to be  
Meant to be  
Run from shame and suffering   
Hunt them down and tear them out  
The bullets in her chest   
The ax head in her arm  
Such resolutions in her mind  
The constitution of a mothers love   
cold conclusions  
winter gloves   
I'll send her one   
A gift to ease her weariness   
A foot bath machine  
No that's too serious

It would be a shame for me to ask this and not share anything myself. Check the comments for my contribution.

*Edit: Or if someone just wants to talk but not necessarily in a public forum

I know the word ""addiction"" is often (and incorrectly) used to signify a passion or obsessive quality people have for an object/activity/what have you. And while I firmly believe people can become addicted to just about anything, or reading trashy romance novels.

Anyone who's in recovery or has ""come back from the brink"" knows exactly what I'm talking about. It's where once is one time too many; where the ""desire"" to eat, or sixty.

And for anyone who believes that addiction is simply the failure of mind over matter, that you are 100% wrong. I can't paint a picture for you; it is one of those things that you have to experience (either directly or empathetically) to understand...though I suspect that INFPs who do not personally share this struggle will have less of a problem empathizing than would other populations.

A while ago I tested as an ENFJ

I've read up on your posts and I feel so whole! I take MBTI heavily salted but it just adds zest to the flavor

I have taken [this](http://www.keys2cognition.com/explore.htm) test also, and I have figured out why by seeing myself as an INFP. I grew up as an expat child, having lived in six countries by the time I was fifteen, causing me to adapt to different cultures by way of Fe (I think) before I had formed myself. I had to be conscious of roledynamics because every country made me a different person, I relied on how I was perceived to figure out how I should behave. I attributed all my adolescent insecurites towards having been an expat and now I feel like I know why, my Fe has sort of suppressed my Fi.

My grandma is notoriously bad about caring for her pets. She gets them for selfish reasons and then complains when they act like normal animals. She gets rid of them because she'd rather buy pot than pay a pet deposit. Stuff like that.

So, then getting rid of the dog*, my grandma got a kitten. This is her third pet in ONE YEAR. I begged her to reconsider, but my grandma is very stubborn (notoriously, and very frustratingly so) and just ignored me. *She* wanted a cat, so she got one. No logic or consideration for the well-being of the animal was even considered. She is an immediate gratification sort of person.

So she got the cat. Complained constantly about the kitten being ""annoying"" and ""loud""...it's a kitten. I told her to get an older cat because they are generally cuddly and not hyper

She also has a job where her pet is alone for long periods of time. Like, was scratching furniture (but she didn't listen to me when I explained how to train him!) and generally being loud and lonely. **SO SHE GOT ANOTHER CAT.**

Here's the thing: if you can barely care for one pet

So this weekend on my deck

I flipped shit. I was so beyond angry with her.

On the chance that none of you know, declawing a cat is equivalent to having the tips of the fingers cut off at the first joint below the fingernail. Once the cat goes home, he or she will have trouble walking for several days. One vet described, ""cats bouncing off the walls of the recovery cage because of excruciating pain. Cats that are more stoic huddle in the corner of the recovery cage, immobilized in a state of helplessness, presumably by the overwhelming pain."" There is also speculation that behavioral problem arise in cats that undergo declaw surgery (although there is no hard evidence). 

Vets also suspect that declawing causes many behavioral issues. For example, which may result in the cat using other areas of the house for elimination. Other behavioral side affects are biting and personality changes. Because the cat no longer has its claws for protection, he or she may overcompensate for the loss by biting. The cat may also become withdrawn or stressed due to the loss of its claws. The stress could be caused by many things including the inability to simply jump onto an object, like a chair or couch or bed, and hold on with its claws. Even the joy of playing will be altered because the cat will no longer be able to grasp string or other toys with its claws. 

And yet, that it's illegal and considered abuse in just about every other first- and second-world country, and that when she got the pets she signed a waiver promising to never de-claw her cat. She blew me off.

I don't really know what to do

[Source.](http://www.paw-rescue.org/declaw_paper.php)

Edit: I sent her a polite email with the link to paw rescue. I offered to teach her how to clip her cats claws and told her I would explain how to ""scratch proof"" her home. She hasn't responded and I don't think she will. If she continues with her plan I'm going to let the shelters in the area know so that they can black-list her.

I basically just typed anything that was coming to my head... Sooo yeah


Considering most conversations that take place on this subreddit deal with a world I have, I have a question or two about being an INFP in high school (just if your wondering the type of high school experiences I have, I live in the United States)

But anyway

I'm getting sidetracked

For me, understands my outlook on life.. And when i do, they usually understand that I understand that.
(A Mutual understanding)

The only problem is that
And in some cases a friendship is formed, and after a while its just too weird to start talking again because.. well I don't know 

Bottom line.. I'm not sure how to make friends with other INFPs. I realize the only way for it to work is if we are both our genuine personality when we socialize... But it's just so difficult to do so in a highschool environment

Hey Natalie... 


I’ve been waiting a long time to write this letter. Deep down I always felt that one day I would write it. I don’t even know if I’m going to send it though. Maybe it will forever remain a file on my computer never to be printed out and sent snail-mail. Or maybe you will rip the letter to shreds



I’m sorry. It has been near a year since last I spoke to you. I realize you probably don’t understand my seemingly random/immature decision to cut you out of my life. Sure, I think I can say that I am not the person I was a year ago. But who I was said a lot of things to you that haunt me to this day.  
 


For the latter half of high school and first semester of college, that I couldn’t have friends and I would never really have a social life. I was a hermit at the age of 17. Of course, I still spoke up in class and had a few acquaintances, but for the most part I kept to myself. I didn’t turn to my family for help because of the religious differences between them and I. I was just as socially awkward/isolated at church as I was at school. I didn’t seem to fit in with anyone… anywhere. I disqualified myself from the human race. Unless I was around you.  

  

It is actually a bit of a miracle that you actually let me be your boyfriend in the first place. I don’t even really remember how it happened. I had always liked you since middle school. You were kind of my best friend. I remember the e-mails we used to send to each other. The smiles we traded in hallways between class. How sad I was when we went to different high schools. I don’t know what gave me the courage to spend more time with you towards the end of Junior year. Maybe it was our annual Elitch Gardens excursion. I think that was it. All I knew is that I wanted to be around you every spare moment I had. 



I think saying I was a little “clingy” when we dated is an incredible understatement. You were literally everything; I never truly invested myself in anything or anyone before you. I had good grades and did extra circulars at school, what rules I was breaking, or what I should be doing with myself. Someone who accepted me for me. I went from someone with little to no self-esteem to someone with a girlfriend, and you paid the price. 



I was the personification of the phrase “misery loves company” towards the end of our relationship. I wanted you to need me as much as I needed you, and pressuring for physical intimacy. I became a controlling monster. And you did the only logical thing there was to do; put distance between you and me. I practically couldn’t get out of bed for a week after that. I couldn’t even be your friend. I was so self-absorbed in self-pity and doubt that it was all I could do to stay on top of my school work. I got a C for the first time on my semester report card too. Everything at that point in my life was a catastrophe. I lost my high school sweetheart, my straight A’s and B’s transcript and all my parents could tell me was that everything would be alright if I started going back to church. No one understood the depth of my misery. Well fine. If the world didn’t get along with me I decided I wouldn’t get along with the world. 



The reason I didn’t go to my own graduation was because of the complete disconnect I had with… well, combined with the fact that I earned a scholarship (which was as much luck as hard work paying off), really pushed the buttons of everyone around me. I wasn’t acting like a mature, intellectual scholar who deserved to be funded to go to school. I acted like an adolescent hothead with a serious attitude problem. They say you either turn your pain into sadness or anger. I decided to do the latter publically for the first time in my life. I didn’t show up for some of my exams at the end of the year. I told my parents I would skip them all if they didn’t let me skip my own graduation. So they did. I think it was a relief when I finally went off to college for them. I was nearly impossible to live with. I was overly critical, angry, a walking-time bomb… They said I would do a lot of growing up at college. They were right. 



I was no longer living with my family. Roommates and strangers don’t have any obligation to put up with outrageous behavior. So I reverted back to my original high school ways. I became a ghost. I spoke only when spoken to, and then go to class. Rinse and repeat) Acquaintances would ask me where the hell I studied and what I did all day. I would simply shrug it off and mutter something about being a strong introvert. Only my two roommates knew I tended to sleep most days away. Slowly, my peers developed their social circles and accepted that I did not want their friendship. I told myself I chose to be alone. I enjoyed solitude. I tried to shun my loneliness out of existence. There was one person who noticed my behavior though. Her name was Julianne. 



Julianne was my next door neighbor in the women’s triple next to mine. She was just as quiet as I was. I remember sitting down and having a 2 hour heart to heart with her at one point in time. She asked me if I was having depression issues. She told me my habits and demeanor reminded her of herself in high school before she decided to homeschool. Sadly



It wasn’t long before I started to develop feelings for her; I still desperately wanted the intimacy of a girlfriend. I remember pretending to do homework with her alone in a classroom late one night, removed her hand from mine, and said something that has stuck with me to this day: “Two broken people don’t make a whole.”



Seeing an on-campus councilor/therapist (I don’t know the difference) helped a little



It was at this point that my depression intensified to a critical level. I reached the semester break of and went back home. Those two weeks were perhaps the worst in my life. There was something about being home, or any other obligation, so I rarely did. I locked myself up in my room with my computer and Xbox, wasting my days away on the internet. After a few days, even these activities I had always relied failed to distract me. My media became meaningless. I had no class to attend. No homework to do. No girl to anxiously pursue. But I did have a new temptress. Her name was Suicide.   



My parents took me to emergency room when I mentally fell apart in front of them after one particularly bitter argument. I was taken to a mental facility 3 in the morning in the back of an ambulance. That ride was one of the most surreal experiences in my life…

I was a Team Lead in customer service for a nationally known software company and it about CRUSHED my soul. I found myself having to adhere to policies that were cheating people...or even if the customer WAS wrong I'd feel guilty knowing that I couldn't help them. All-in-all

My favorite job was probably working at the nursing home in dining services. It wasn't glamorous but I got to see the same people every day which let me develop deeper relationships with people. I genuinely felt like I was doing something good. 


Second favorite was working at the bookstore because...well...I was surrounded by books! When things were quiet I could sneak off and read a few chapters of a graphic novel or book. 

Right now I'm finishing up my English degree and I'm hoping to go to Korea to teach English sometime next year. I want to learn Korean because after hearing about all the stuff going down in North Korea...I can't ignore it. So, save up money to pay off debts (I hate feeling like a slave...being in debt makes me feel like one but that's a whole other post) and hopefully learn Korean. I'm hoping I can use that back in the states and work for an NK aid organization or something....but nothings set in stone, naturally hahaha.


So, I'm just really curious what types of jobs suit us best...and what kind of jobs kill our souls!

He does all the things I found listed on [this](http://www.youmeworks.com/sociopaths.html) site

1. They make you feel sorry for them.

2. They make you feel worried or afraid.

3. They give you the impression you owe them.

4. They make you feel used.

5. Sometimes you suspect they don't care about you.

6. They lie to you and deceive you.

7. They take a lot from you and give back very little.

8. They make you feel guilty (and use that to manipulate you).

9. They take advantage of your kindness.

10. They are easily bored and need constant stimulation.

11. They don't take responsibility


So today, I just... disregarded him. I instantly noticed that he was trying to get my attention more as I did. Usually, I'd acknowledge him right away and he'd ignore me for a little bit and then get back to me. I'm not sure that's a good sign, because he may just want my attention to try and get 'power' over me or something.

Just because I'm an INFP

Do you guys have any advice on this? Should I try to get this person out of my life? He's affecting other people as well. My *actual* friends, but none of them really seem to be trying to deal with it. I'm not sure if I should tell my friends that I think this guy's a sociopath, or to just keep it to myself and nudge them into thinking that he's unhealthy to be around? Should I let them decide for themselves? It kills me to see my friends (one in particular gets extremely guilted by him, and has even cried to me multiple times about how badly he's made her feel) get manipulated by this guy. 

He's nice when he wants something, he flips. Completely flips. And I realize that now.

So yeah

**TL;DR** - I just realized my ""friend"" is a sociopath. He's manipulative and narcissistic, which has been quite effective in the past. But now I'm onto him. How should I deal with this? Drop him from my life entirely? Gradually cut contact?  He's hurting some of my REAL friends too. I don't want to leave them to fend for themselves against him.
