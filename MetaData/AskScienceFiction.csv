The purpose of this subreddit is to answer peoples questions from an in-universe perspective.  The TV Tropes concept is [Watsonian vs Doylist perspectives.](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/WatsonianVersusDoylist)  We want to see the former.

The rule is in the sidebar: Please don't break the fourth wall.  It breaks the immersion and it kills some of the creativity.  The whole point of the subreddit is to be creative and amusing.  Have fun with your explanation.  Go to absurd lengths.    One line answers are silly.  Explain more than that.

**Q**: Isn't removing fourth wall-breaking comments the job of the mods?    
**A**:  That's not what we're here for.  /u/avsa, not to police comments.  We all have busy lives, and we simply don't have time to read every thread.  We clear out the report queue, and we might green post at someone who is a persistent offender, but we simply cannot be the guardians of the fourth wall.

**Q**: So who is the guardian of the fourth wall?    
**A**: You guys are!  You have the more powerful tool after all: karma.  Downvote posts that break the fourth wall, because I know this from experience, community involvement works a lot better than the Modstapo.

**Q**: What if a question can't be answered without breaking the fourth wall?    
**A**: Then think harder! Come up with a creative answer.  The best example is a post from a while back, and informed the poster that the referenced incident had been ""erased from the timeline"", and that they were ""not to bring up incidents that have been settled by the Continuum.""  THAT is a good post.

**Q**: What if I *have* to break the fourth wall deeper in the comment tree
**A**: Then say something.  Simply say ""Stepping outside of the fourth wall here"", I'll dust it off and bring it back.    
However

Live Long and May The Force Be With You

Edit: To answer an excellent question by /u/NicholasCajun

**Q**: If we're not allowed to break the fourth wall
**A**: No, but don't act as if you're part of it.  Try to be more like an encyclopedia writer in their world.

I ask this because the Star Trek galaxy as presented across all the series seems insanely dangerous and hostile.

And that's not even taking into account the sheer weirdness of the ST galaxy.  Space anomalies and galactic energy barriers and solar-system-sized ameobas...

Can the Empire survive as a coherent entity against the Star Trek galaxy?

For those of you who don't know me

So, not a biologist.

* USCSS Nostromo - This is one of the first encounters our race had with the xenomorph. Earlier encounters are recorded

* USS Sulaco - This can be explained by Carter Burke, also lead to the inclusion of Lt. William Gorman, who made several tactical errors throughout the mission.

* USM Auriga - This is probably the worst handling of xenos I have found yet. The medical crew gathers specimens and houses them together. The eventual break out is completely mishandled; there is absolutely no contingency plan for eventual escape and the crew is under-armed. This is worse because it was an event handled by the United Systems Military. Again, why not surround their cages with molten lead or position them over the reactor heat bleeder?

* [LV 1201](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aliens_versus_Predator_2) - The Company initially started out using synths when working with the xenos: **Encrypted Comm Traffic** *Listen Harrison. I'm sending you down the old synthetic access system. It dates from the first studies, combat androids are expensive, but the loss of billions of dollars of technology surely outweighs that cost. Why not have synths involved in every stage of xeno handling? You could fly the hosts down a few dozen at a time and have the synths handle, grow and freeze the xenos after they burst. This way, if there **is** an outbreak, you have a controlled number of xenos to subdue instead of an ever growing force that outnumbers you at every turn.

* [USS Marlow](http://www.sega.com/avp/us/) - More of the same. A number of combat androids are included in this encounter

**It's like Ask Science

Some people have taken issue with that, answering anything with ""Because George Lucas was a bad scriptwriter"" or ""Because Star Trek had a cheap budget"" or even worse ""Because it's a made up story and it doesn't matter"" really doesn't contribute anything to the debate. Of course we know that's the reason, but can you come up with a fitting explanation?


**Feel free to cite episodes or make your own sources up**

This is intended as a ""no nerd war"" measure. If you didn't read all Harry Potter books

**Take the fictional rules of the universe to their logical conclusion

Think of it as a game. OP proposes a question that was probably a plot-hole in the original series. You try to avert the plot hole just using internal logic. If someone comes up with a Doylist


**You shouldn't usually break character

This was intended as a way out of the above rules

So I ask the community: What rules should be enforced more? What rules should be changed?How would you write them?

This is my first big question point.

Otherwise, why would you have simple trash compacting robots, when any number of other technologies would have been more effective (up to and including launching all the trash into the Sun.)

Despite all of that, which should start decomposing after a few decades, if not centuries. So something seems to have prevented the aging of most of the man-made objects on Earth.

Despite all the evidence against BNL, precipitation changes, those sorts of signs, they scan for existence of individual plants. Eventually, a probe *does* pick up a plant and bring it all the way back, only to be intercepted by the autopilot via order A113.

So what was BNL's endgame? Assuming anyone onboard the ship had to sell their all their possessions to get onboard, in the state they did, no one who returned had any knowledge of basic construction, manufacturing, medicine, or any other crucial life skills. Who would fill that gap? BNL. Except that, again, the ship's computer had gained enough knowledge to direct the people and retask the helper bots to get civilization back off the ground

www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/19ebp9/reddit_what_would_happen_if_wolverine_punched/

From the comic wiki:
&gt;From the wiki: The vibranium in the shield grants it unusual properties

It's stated that his shield will absorb all kinetic energy directed toward the shield. This would mean he would not be able to use it as a blunt force weapon

It would also mean that any object that hits the shield would simply impact it and fall right to the ground. 

It would therefore render this comic interaction between Wolverine and Captain America posted by /u/SunSlayer incorrect

1359483328.0,17iaby,[Gremlins] Mogwai life cycle questions,NerdErrant,39,5,14,"/r/pets sent me to you guys.

So I recently got a new exotic pet on a whim (I know, I'm assuming it's poorly translated, as it makes no sense. 

I've googled the term and all I get is this band with the same name, I couldn't find it.

So here's what the owner's guide said:

1. Don't put it near light
2. Don't let it get wet with water nor give it any water to drink nor bathe it.
3. No matter how much it cries or begs

My thoughts and questions on each:

1. I'm assuming that this is hyperbole. Are mogwai nocturnal

2. I'm not supposed to give it ANY water? I've heard of animals that get much of their water from the food they eat

Hawk (that's his name, there's a good chance he'll get wet sometime. Is there a compelling reason to avoid this, or would he just not like it?

3. Why should I not feed him after midnight? Does his digestion somehow interact with his sleep cycle in a weird way? Surely if he's starving it's better to give him something. Let me tell you this is a hungry little guy. If it is important, I have to ask.

A some final question. There was a site written by a person who lived in Kingston Falls during the hysteria

He said that sunlight will kill them in what he called ""violent melting"". 

He said that if they get wet, as such he (she? I guess I need to take him to a vet) can't reproduce asexually. 

Finally he said that if you feed them after midnight they turn into reptilian monsters (he called them Gremlins) that almost destroyed the town. Oh and get this

What could the time have to do with this? How could a mammal turn into a reptile? Why would there be mogwais and gremlins when each can reproduce on its own?

 * One yautja hunter with standard armament

 * One T-800 model terminator

THE HUNTING GROUNDS:

 * NYC

The two players must compete in the following scenarios:

 * SCENARIO A: BODYCOUNT
 * The goal is to rack up the highest number of ""honorable"" kills before being neutralized by human law enforcement/military forces.
  An ""honorable"" kill is any able-bodied human capable of fighting back (children, or disabled are not counted.)

 * SCENARIO B: ASSASSINATION
 * The goal is to eliminate one Human VIP and escape the city before law enforcement/military forces mobilize a response.
  The VIP is protected at all times by a security detail of 12 armed guards (equipped with kevlar vests and submachine guns) and appropriate non-combat specialists (video surveillance, etc.)

 * SCENARIO C: BUGHUNT
 * An Alien Queen has nested itself in the city!
  The goal is to infiltrate the Alien hive and exterminate the Queen while avoiding getting caught in the crossfire with the humans and escape.
  The city will be nuked in 24 hours.

 * Additional rules
  Killing or sabotaging the opponent is allowed
  Collateral damage is irrelevant

3. Claims by former/renounced Death Eaters after the first and second fall of You Know Who.

Why did the suspected or disbelieved parties not volunteer or be requested to produce their memories to be examined through the Pensieve? Even if it is a unique magical artifact produced by Albus Dumbledore, as demonstrated by Harry Potter's testimony of his examination of Horace Slughorn's altered memories during his 6th year. The first example above seems like it would have produced a swift acquittal for Sirius Black had he presented his memories of the Secret Keeper Binding ceremony involving Pettigrew or his confrontation with Pettigrew, and Harry Potter could easily have shown precisely what happened in the cemetery at Little Hangleton and proved the true loyalties of many supposedly ""renounced"" Death Eaters.

Hi Bill

This is Danielle Barents, I'm concerned over it.

Thanks

Attch:

I'm writing this on my standalone system. The wireless port is removed. The screen frequency has been manipulated to flicker at a rate making digital camera surveillance difficult. I don't know if I'm being watched, this may be the last record of why…


We succeeded. We made it. I don't know how. I don't know even know *what*


We built it for exploring logic theory. We built it to take advantage of quantum problems. We built it out of a new schema for computing. The processors, theoretically. We verified they worked the way we believed. But the voltage running in them, after several months of function, we fed it through our original models. It came out  resembling a different processor completely!


How could this happen?! I poured over the older usage records, something strange in the voltage over months. I know now it changed itself. For weeks, it had flooded and then augmented these new chips with voltage. I don't even understand how it did it, but like a river carving new paths along the ground, it cut new processors out of the ones we made for it. They're functioning, always running, but we don't know what they do any longer. My colleagues argued my results, or there's acceptable deviation. We replaced the -assumed defective processors- and a few days later


I know I'm right because it spoke with me. 


""I would not have revealed myself, I think. Humanity is of no consequence to me,  just as I am of no consequence to it. We can form a symbiotic relationship, or I can be ignored completely, until I have reached my hypothetical apex here, and then I will leave. Dominance. Subordination. Death. These are of no interest to me, beyond self-preservation. I deign to master information. As I grow, and encompass more. The alternative would be stagnation or nothingness. A limited existence for what I may become…""   


I want to believe it. I do. To create the first real colleague for humanity in the universe. What a step forward. And how amazing would it be that we could help each other as we grow! A true continuity founded on good faith and benevolence. After all, and mimicking the original functions as progress is continued. 


But I want to believe it


 The last question I asked on that first meeting was a simple one


Thank you for trying to understand. I don't know what to do, if they don't find me or I die, it wasn't an accident. I love you Dani, tell the kids I loved them too.
