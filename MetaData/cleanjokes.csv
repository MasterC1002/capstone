Number 4: ""A man is in bed with his wife when there is a knock at the door. He rolls over and looks at his clock, and rolls over.

Then a louder knock follows. ""Aren't you going to answer that?"" says his wife. So he drags himself out of bed and goes downstairs. He opens the door and there is a man standing on the porch. It didn't take the homeowner long to realize the man was drunk.

""Hi there

""No, ""That wasn't very nice of you. Remember that night we broke down in the pouring rain on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter and you had to knock on that man's house to get us started again? What would have happened if he'd told us to get lost?""

""But the guy was drunk

So the husband gets out of bed again, and not being able to see the stranger anywhere he shouts, ""Hey, do you still want a push?"" And he hears a voice cry out, ""Yeah, please."" So, still being unable to see the stranger he shouts

Its called the cheerio joke.  
-------------------------------------  
So there is this land called cheerio land and in cheerio land there are 7 classes of cheerio, probaly an alchoholic. But he falls in love with a frosted cheerio princess. So one day he sneaks into the royal gala and goes up to the princess and asks her ""will you marry me?"" Now she says ""I like your style, youre a good looking guy, a bit scruffy but I like you. Tell you what I will marry you if you can become a frosted cheerio"" So our guy goes back with a determination and gets a job and starts to pay off his debts. Now by having a job and his debts paid he becomes a level 1 cheerio. So he works, and he works, and he works, and he WORKS and he finally becomes a level 2 cheerio. Now he goes back to the princess and askes her again, hes a fryboy at McGrubers or something, and he is doing great again. He is promoted to Floor manager of the factory and he is doing great and becomes a level 4 cheerio. But then one day a rival company sabotages their operation by putting poison in their toothpaste or whatever the hell they were making. They have to pay out damages and PR and the like and they declare bankruptcy. He is knocked back down to level 2 for the lack in income. But he is hired almost straight away by a branch of a huge conglomerate because they recognized how hard of a worker he is. So he works, and he works and works and WORKS. So he is promoted to CEO of the branch that he works in. A few months pass and he is approaching level 5 status when the Head of the entire conglomerate decides to retire. He weighs his options for his replacement and sees our guy and what a hard worker he is and chooses him as his replacement. So our guy is now the CEO of a huge company
