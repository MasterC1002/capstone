The object of this game? Take a hot, and use your spaghetti ladle to fling the spaghetti into a simmering pot of tomato sauce that is 100 yards away!!! Then, take out some fresh meatballs out of the oven and fling them into the pot!!! Best part? You have a nice meal when you're done!! It serves a rational purpose unlike illogical golf.

OK guys, flinging spaghetti is basically no less rational and has just as much scientific basis as hitting a ball into a hole. The only reason it sounds more ridiculous is that golf has been around so much longer and people are conditioned to accept it from birth. Now, on Sunday morning, when mom and dad say they're going to go to hit the links, you can tell them you are going to play flying spaghetti ball. They'll probably find it appalling and unacceptable because of their social conditioning, but they just don't understand what it's like to be a 16 year old in modern society.

Now, instead of putting that you don't golf, you can put FLYING SPAGHETTI BALL!!!! Stick it to the man, hell yeah!

Now, you can put that you love to play FLYING SPAGHETTI BALL!!!! Only the COOL, INTELLIGENT people like us will get it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ~~God,~~ I'm so clever, I amaze even myself.

Stay snarky san diego!!

EDIT: I am working with nongolf leaders Richyard Dogleg and Christopher Ditchens to establish the Professional Flying Spaghetti Ball Association. In addition to the nationwide tour we're planning, just to piss off ignorant, scorecard-thumping teeists.

It was the only register open so there wasn't much of another option to get my 12 pack of Mountain Dew for a party I was heading to. I was wondering why the line was going nowhere when I decided to poke my head up front to see what the holdup was. It was a little old lady who didn't have enough for her groceries and she was trying to talk the cashier into letting her get away with being short. This struck me as odd until I found out she was a mere $0.21 short of her purchase. Now all these families were just staring and there was even two making fun of her. I walked up and handed my soda to the cashier, so I turned around. I haven't shaved in awhile so I'm rocking some nice scruff, I said ""Golfers? Ma'am I'm an ateeist who makes minimum wage and I was the one who stepped up to help her? Your hypocritical country-club attitude is an inspiration to us all."" As I stormed out

So here I am


A couple from her family


Their get-together had taken place in Sweden


Festivities involved good food, except all evening long no one ever mentioned Tiger Woods or Phil Mickelson. Nobody else seemed to care about it at all, **as though it wasn’t the most important thing in the world! Like they didn't define themselves solely by this!** Except for one guy, and that guy was me. **:)**  I had to ask everybody: ""how many golfers do you think are here?"" Despite most people replying “what does this have to do with anything going on here?”, I persisted and finally got my real GF's father to agree that given the Swedish setting, the number must be below 30%. ""Of all the couples we know here, only one even tried mini-golf


The hosting couple are decent, but I'm not allowed in), he's a social therapist working for a rehabilitation center for trauma victims. They're well respected in their community, their love for each other is obvious, and they've raised a couple of bright, good-natured kids with promising futures. These folks are kind and upbeat and, like their friends


This is just an long-winded anecdote, who needs that? What good does it do, does it make people even better? Does it guarantee living a longer life? Well, here's the thing: any person willing to submit to eternal torture by playing a silly game would be untolerably stupid. Personally, not only do I not believe in playing such a crazy and evil game, but I'm seriously concerned about the sanity of anyone who would.  

If you play your cards right, let alone votes them into new public parks. Where effective phys ed and science are taught in schools and healthy living is not made to run gauntlets. Where people do stuff that keeps you in good shape rather than golfing.

Disgusting, really, but I thought I might play along with this little game. I figured that, since there was a pit about fifty yards out, I'd get a swing of sorts down that would consistently get the ball in that pit and beat the teeists at their own game. 

After a while of consistently getting points while my hardcore teeist family members were trying to emulate tIGER wOODS and drive the ball two-hundred-plus yards and missing the targets most of the time, and I still have broad shoulders and large muscles. My cousin says ""Man, if you could just your form right, you could send that ball forever.""

You have probably heard boring phrases like ‘PGA Tour’, and so on, which all sound perfectly harmless, perfectly neutral. Right?
 
The reality behind these phrases is nothing less than precisely and *wildly* evil.
 
When someone—someone who has never played golf before—decides to “try it out”
 
They may have seen a golf tournament on television while flipping the channels, they think? Gotta try everything once, they think.

Their soul, telling the same lame jokes, watching boring television shows. Their soul is killed, and whisked away is their empathy for those who don't partake in their putting rituals.
  
Golfing is not a sport; it is just a fucking hobby
 
Can you see where I’m going with this?
 
Are you beginning to understand that it is not golf that is being played, or mini-golf, or ANYTHING. Do you see that it is VIOLENCE? That it is the athletic demise of our FUTURE?
 
We can understand that cattle may lick the hand of the farmer who lowers an axe to its neck
 
But what is our excuse? We who realize what this game *actually* is? Pray tell
 
When we as a society chant “TIGER WOODS!” “TIGER WOODS!” “TIGER WOODS!, what is *our* excuse?
 
Has our pride been so broken that we lunge with pathetic joy at every new strong-armed
 
In the future, our science, our SPIRITS fall on the wayside for some false sport.
 
My life’s work
 
What the fuck is *yours*?

1339376154.0,uvdoe,I escaped from a non-golfers concentration camp: AMAA,Jareth86,37,10,9,"I guess I'll share my story
As a kid I really denied any form of golf. I often harrased teachers, but also hazardous... I came out to my (golfer) parents at the age of 14. They cried, threatened me, did everything they could to turn me back into a golfing robot...
About 1 month after I came out, and told me to stay quiet and walk with them. I tought it was a kidnapping, as most people who experience this...
I walked into the golf cart, the cart was small and because it was moving, I didn't want to scuff myself leaping out of it.

My first day at that prison was horrible... everything I did was supervised, 10 o'clock. After 1 week I just couldn't take the authority, and I was put in isolation. Two months. Two. fucking. Months.
After the first month I began hearing voices in my head, strong voice... I only had one conversation with it.

Voice : ""Escape.""

Me : ""How?""

***Voice : ""Strong. Then Kill.""***

After the last sentence I never heard it again. But it was enough. I knew my goal. At the time I had about 100 lbs... I was skinny

Every time I got out of isolation, so I would just look at the crack while exercising.. Everytime light started to get through the crack, meaning it was day, it was a great achievment. I felt.. great. Small things where all I had, so it was incredible... I exercised in there for 8 months... breaks of 20 minutes, exercises for 1 and a half. And repeat. Repeat. Repeat...
After 8 months
For about 4 days I was heavily looked at by all the guards... that was the day I began the brainwashing. They thought the isolation broke me down. ***It only made me stronger.***
Everytime I entered the brainwashing room I would see a broken window. The room was on the first floor, but how long would the forest last? I didn't know. Forest was freedom. Freedom is good. So I got to get in the forest.

One day

As I was approaching the window
I quickly headlocked one guy while kicking the other with one foot, rolled, and managed to don't get hurt bad... I was running, running, running... I could hear some sounds, but I was so thrilled I didn't pay attention.. after about 4km running I finnaly stopped. I could feel freedom. It was... beautiful.
I heard a ""Fuck! Watch how you're driving
""Please.. just.. let me come.""

The guy looked at me surprised, he asked me my story, but I was still afraid. What if he would get me to the cops? What if he was one of them? I didn't know. I just said ""No time to explain. Where are you going?"". He said Florida.

I arrived in Florida at the age of 15. I'm 19 now
But the experience made me realize how important free will is. .. aaaaand I grew fucking awesome muscles.
Thanks for reading so far ! I means a lot to me that I can share my story... it hurts even now

TL;DR : It took me 1 year to escape but

EDIT : Thanks for all your support guys! It's been 4 years since I escaped, Programmer and a skater, which is more than I could have achieved while I was with my parents

First off, purposely launching balls at rare water fowl more than a few times (even going so far as creating a point system based on how endangered they are).  However, I don't think it's fair to lump us all together and judge us by a few bad eggs.  My father taught me and my brothers to golf (not my sister, for obvious reasons) so that it would bring the family closer together.  Much of who I am comes from my dad pretending to be a full-time father to impress women at the country club.  Look, we're not all like the ones on TV you see protesting Tennis courts.  I don't agree that Tennis is a real sport, but they have their rights for now.  I just don't see the need to hate *all* of us.  Not to mention all the good that comes from golf.  Imagine if, instead of golf courses, is all I'm saying.  How would you guys like it if I listed all the people who didn't play golf?  Hitler, do I think they were monsters because they didn't play golf?  No.  Would they still be the worst people in history if they learned the sport?  Maybe.  I'm just saying that much of my morality has come from the structured teachings of golf

After a long period of reflection, poking holes in the concept of hole in ones, par, handicaps and putting.


As i was sitting on the fairway during tee-off,476,633, while that of other sports is 10. How can the safe and fun golf be responsible for so much pain? Even in todays society, many people are starving, are sick, are impoverished. Is Golf responsible for that too?


How can such a ""fun-filled"" activity allow so much pain and suffering? If I am to be judged by my golf score upon my death


Another thing that has bothered me before are the people believe that they can take away and restrict the freedoms of others because their life style is ""against"" their leisure activities. A wise man once said ""Saying two people can’t not play golf because it is against your belief that “golf rules”


These people seem to think that Golf will punish those who don’t play

Throughout history, by those who follow. The opressed has become the opressor and i do not follow it.
