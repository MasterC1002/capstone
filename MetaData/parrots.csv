Basically the guy told me he was outside about to start his his leaf blower and Alex landed on his shoulder.  SO he walked into his garage with ALex and then put him in a pet carrier while he went notfiy his wife.  SHe said "" I saw flyers for a missing bird on the stop at the end of the street""  so they called us!

-amazon

-eclectus (male and female)**

-budgie

-cockatiel**

-sulfur-crested cockatoo**

-white cockatoo (probably applicable to goffin's, the image won't be any larger than 30 px max).

-scarlet macaw**

-indian ringneck**

If anyone has any other birds they'd like to see added to this list, feel free to post them. I might use some as the basis for a sketch.

That's all for now

EDIT: sample [sun conure] (http://i.imgur.com/HJ5DKi4) and [IRN] (http://i.imgur.com/9c203h2.png) so you can see what I mean.

**EDIT #2** The new additions to the list:

-lovebird (peach and fischer's)

-parrotlet**

-caique (white belly and black cap)**

-hahn's macaw**

-meyer's parrot

-senegal**

-pineapple gcc**

-pionus (blue head and white cap)**

-galah**

-gold cap conure

-DYH amazon

**EDIT #3: [This](http://imgur.com/a/YZcjb) is what I've done so far.**
 
-B&amp;G Macaw/Major Mitchell/white-faced cockatiel** also added to my to-do list. This was far more popular than expected! I'm off to bed


**means that it's done. I may/may not have also posted it somewhere in the thread.
