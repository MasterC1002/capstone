During CNN American Morning this morning

Dr. Sanjay Gupta basically stated that, but the rest of the panel was treating pot like a joke.

One panelist made jokes about cheetos and video games, and shouldn't be made available, even saying ""What about the children"".

Don Lemon is the fucking man. He was professional, and if you're prone to addiction anything is a gateway drug"". He stated that alcohol and tobacco are far more dangerous, but both of those are legal.

He was bombarded with attacks

So my buddy had gone through the steps mentioned in the previous post. He had refused the drug test and spoken to his lawyer about drafting a letter about his rights and the harassment. He was ready to stand his ground

Well

Yesterday after work the landlord's wife stopped by his apartment and knocked on the door. My buddy answered (which I thought was sort of dumb

My buddy tells me the wife apologized profusely for her husband. She said that she was unaware about her husband asking my friend for a drug test until late the previous night

She basically told my friend that the downstairs neighbor is a pain in the ass. She said he constantly complains about everything and is a thorn in her husband's side about every little inconvenience. She said she understands that they have responsibilities as a landlord

She said she doesn't put up with his incessant bitching

She said she was furious at her husband because he annoyed my friend about a drug test when he was a good tenant. She said to my friend, and have been a joy to have here. I don't even care if he smokes weed as long as his rent check clears."".

She said she informed her husband that he has to stop cow-towing to the downstairs neighbor

She said she had asked her husband to call and apologize to my friend

We need to change the dialogue about substance abuse, especially among health care professionals (both physical and mental health) to better define abuse for various drugs, illegal and legal, before just classifying everyone as an abuser.

When I was reading through the different posts and whatnot

This happens in other types of mediums as well

While toking a bit, I hatched a plan to find out.

I go to the bar with some buddies of mine every Sunday for the game. It's always a good time. We have a few beers

I'm a big Dolphins fan, however, I decided to wear it to the bar ... simply so I could see how many people make comments on it and whether or not I could convince them that my jersey was actually of a player that existed.

It took a little while for someone to come up to me, ""Oh man? You don't remember him? He was the wide receiver for the Dolphins in the late 90s. He got injured two or three years into the pros and was forced to retire early.""

The guy immediately looked puzzled, ""Holy shit, you're right. I forgot about him. Shame about that injury too. He was going to be huge."". He gave me a high-five and went about the day.

Throughout the remaining 5 or 6 hours we were at the bar, to which I of course replied yes.

All of my friends were in on the joke with me

All in all

Doing this gave me perspective on the way I present myself to others

Figured I'd share :)

",Dyltreeno,348,42,http://www.reddit.com/r/eldertrees/comments/zfz0c/had_the_most_touching_moment_of_my_life_so_far/, I always find myself 2 steps back.  I'm a generally likeable and charming person, and having to move back to my family home.  

My father is a painter, because of his busy schedule, he gave me my own job to do.  It's just a small job of wallpapering a living room, but there's a damn lot of prep work (scraping emultion off of an the entirity of the room, sanding the plaster down, yadda yadda).  

Anyways, no children.  The guy is the friendliest person I've met.  Usually on a job it can get annoying when people are constantly talking to you, but I don't mind when this guy does.  He has dozens of amazing stories about his experiences in WWII, his turn to pacifisim, and basically just his life experiences.  

Yesterday, I said I did.  He's been smoking since his 40's, and said despite having no children and a deceased wife, that he's really enjoyed all his time; and mainly thanks to marijuana and the people he's met because of it.  

So I've been putting in the hours at this job; 7am-9pm.  This is usually a bit of a drag, and that he's smoked with it all of his life.  He even brought it with him on board his ship in WWII.  

Nothing has touched me more than this in my life ever...and it's all thanks to Marijuana.  I told him that when I finished his job that I would pop by for a smoke every couple of weeks.

I legitimately had one of the coolest things happen to me tonight
I've been dry for about 2 weeks now. New town, and ended up tearing the trench. Big bummer again. I finally got around to emailing them about a warranty claim, and got a response today saying to tear out the screen. So I do, and what do I see? MOTHER FUCKING HONEY. Booya! I end up scraping up just enough to put on a cigarette.
I decided to go for a drive (I was about a [4], more than any I've seen in pictures since I had never seen one in real life. I basically lock eyes with the thing while I'm slowly driving by, and decide to turn around so I can get another look at her. I'm slowing my car down and she freaking follows my car! She looked like the most curious creature ever. That's when I decide to pull into this driveway and just watch. She comes probably within 10 or 15 feet of my car and just stands and looks at me. I'm completely euphoric at this point, as foxes are my all time favorite animal ever. So freaking cool. So as she finally turns around to walk off, I look and see ANOTHER FREAKING GREY FOX. The first one catches up to the second one and they just majestically walk off into the woods.
I know that probably seems like a really lame story, and this really just made me stop and think. I got so happy over seeing 2 foxes. Why on earth do I need to get so worked up about trivial things when I can find joy in things like that?

Sorry I couldn't reply to people yesterday

Before I get to an update

- This story is NOT about me. It's about a buddy. My buddy is not a Redditor.

- This is not an apartment complex with building management or anything. This is a 3 family house owned by a private individual. He's described the landlord as ""very blue collar"". He works as a construction worker or something on a full time basis.

- There is no weed currently in his house. He brought it over his girlfriend's place. The only thing he has on him is his Magic Flight

Anyways

The landlord apparently called my buddy yesterday afternoon around 6pm (fortunately, is there a time I can come by this week and we can just take care of this.I know you're not happy about this, neither am I, but I just want to make Randy (the downstairs neighbor) happy so he puts an end to this."".

My buddy said he dealt with his landlord as nicely as possible, ""You have no legal right to make me take a drug test, and I refuse to do so. This is where I live, and I don't appreciate being harassed regularly when I've done nothing wrong. This has severely disrupted my life. If this continues to happen, I'm going to take the proper legal steps necessary to ensure I can live in this apartment in peace."".

Apparently this spawned a conversation where the landlord (who obviously was completely ignorant about the law) tried to convince him that he had every right to drug test him because he lived on his property, acting as if he was doing my friend a favor.

My buddy stood his ground

My buddy also went and tried to talk to the neighbor causing this trouble. He said the neighbor was home when he knocked on the door

He said a half-hour or so later the landlord call him again; he let it go to voice mail

I read in the news this morning that the UN is encouraging President Obama to intervene with states where voters have decriminalized cannabis (Colorado &amp; Washington). I read another article 10 min later that former DEA chiefs are also urging Mr. President to ""act now or it might lose the chance to nullify Colorado and Washington's laws legalizing recreational marijuana use.""

Well, it is heinous that cannabis is still an issue, and that states where the voters have chosen to allow cannabis may come under fire for practicing their constitutional rights.

So I called the White House this morning, hell, I've even picketed!  But never made an actual phone call voicing my concerns.  For those of you who are reluctant to take that step, allow me to let you know something.

It took 10 minutes.

10 minutes to stand up for voters

President Obama needs to see that citizens won't stand for this injustice.  He is hearing from everyone else

The number is 202-456-1111. Here is what I said:

""I am calling to urge President Obama to allow states with voter approved medical and recreational cannabis initiatives to continue to provide cannabis without federal interruption.

I also encourage Mr. President to remove cannabis from the Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act.  It's time to put an end to federal raids of medical patients and their medical cannabis providers.""

Make sure to thank the volunteer

It took 10 min. Easiest thing I'll do all day

While we do have many problems and topics that the general public want answers for

Here is another number that you should know: 338 billion.

$338,000; that is the estimated total revenue of Alcohol sales in the United States in 2008. If marijuana was not only legalized for medicinal purposes, but also viewed as a control substance, and regulated and taxed like alcohol or tobacco, you can bet that marijuana sales will generate a lot of money for the government, not to mention jobs of building facilities for the growing/harvesting/curing that will be required to accommodate the demand generated by the consumers. This is not even taking into consideration of jobs generated through logistics and other factors that I have not thought of.

Also, then thousands of jobs could be generated just from the production and processing of industrial hemp, not to mention all of the industries that could be brought back home and thrive, with the legalization of hemp and marijuana use.

Feel free to discuss! I felt compelled to post this because of Romney's statement saying that Marijuana is not an important issue, perhaps marijuana can help the economy. Because it certainly couldn't hurt it anymore it seems.

Just drive / ride safe guys, ""Yes, feel free to go smoke pot in Washington."" Hell yes. You won't see the police department's in also-neighboring Idaho saying that. Just don't drive back impaired enough that you get pulled over, which is common sense.

&gt;Yes. The Oregon Medical Marijuana Program allows for card holders to possess certain amounts of marijuana. It does not dictate where card-holders can get it and there are no changes to the Oregon Medical Marijuana Program because of Washington I-502.

I thought back about the things that I thought were ""huge deals"" at that time. I specifically remember having countless sleepless nights over issues related to pleasing my boss at work. I remember tossing and turning trying to figure out how I was going to make rent the next month, now hold absolutely no significance in my life.

I then thought about my worries of today. I'm at a completely different point in my life. I now live with my girlfriend, and making more than enough money to survive because of it. I still have things that worry and stress me, but then I thought to myself, ""In four years, how many of these things will matter?"".

In four years, the things that can cause me stress and sleepless nights nowadays will be insignificant ... so why cause them to have a significant impact on my life now?

I'm not saying ignore life's problems. That's not the point at all. Procrastination and denial can snowball and cause minor issues to turn into major ones

*Melissa
The pun in the article title is part of a tiresome trend where journalists covering cannabis legislation use puns and jokes instead of giving the facts. Perhaps it is because you and your colleagues are nervous reporting on something illegal at the federal level. 

If you would kindly not use puns of this nature in your future articles on the subject, making light of an issue which affects millions. 

Also

Thanks

Her response:
*I appreciate your feedback and for making me think about why I chose
to use a pun in this story.

I agree that this is an issue that affects millions of Americans
which is why I thought it was worthy to cover Sen. Leach's plan in the
first place. I don't feel nervous about reporting on something that is
federally illegal
uphill climb that Leach's proposal has in Pennsylvania. Perhaps I
could have found a more eloquent way of doing so
about your comments in the future as me or editors insert puns into
stories on serious topics.

Appreciate the feedback,

Last week Recruiter B called me about an amazing opportunity for a 2 month long assignment making a mind-boggling amount of money. We talked about the requirements for the job and I told her about the MMJ. She said just take your medical card with you when you get tested. She sounded like it was such a non-problem.

Then today Recruiter A called me about a 4 day long assignment. Normally such a short-term assignment wouldn't require anything BUT this place is part of a very large national company and they require both drug testing and a background check. Background checks, said just take your medical card.

So I'll probably go in and get that drug test today. And find out if the recruiters just have no idea what they are talking about.

The entire issue honestly ... makes me angry. I could take oxy for my pain

Chances are you know how to smoke weed. Pack. Light. Inhale.  Doing so, and wonder.  Getting high. I’m not writing this about ways you can smoke weed to get you the highest. I’m writing this about how you can get the most out of your high, far much more then just an ordinary head-rush.

First off, post-pone your sesh for later; read this first.  If you’ve been for a smoking long time, then you might be familiar with the habit of smoking up after a day of work because it helps you relax.  After smoking a few bowls or joints, you might eventually sit down at your computer and restart yesterday’s task of visiting all your favorite websites such as r/trees.  After all, it is indeed fun, and why not do it every day.  But after you come down, you’ll have to be returned to reality just like every morning when you wake up and get out of bed.  There lies an issue, are regular activities.  I can tell you right now
	
I’ve smoking at least once a day for since around August of last year.  Sometimes I bought more, but I always got a least a little bit high and I always had a good time with my friends.  It wasn’t until recently I had to stop.  And I did, I gave up smoking.  I couldn’t keep up with my friend’s amounts, I had to focus on school as it’s getting harder, and I just never even had money.  Dealing with all of these issues eventually forced things to come to a head and I decided to quit, at least for a little while.  Let me both tell you and warn you.  It sucks. Knowing how much fun is.  You feel left out of the circle when you have to pass the bong to the next person in the rotation without even hitting it yourself.  But once you get over it, even in a similar process of that when you break up with somebody, I feel as if I transformed from an ordinary college student reminiscent of the guy from the Nickelodeon show

If you’re still with me, dying and restarting your inner-stoner, you will learn so many things to help you live and appreciate life with such an elevated appreciation.  The first time I got high after I quit, as you can guess, I got pretty high.  The familiar and missed sensation of being high. But something had changed. Something was there that wasn’t there before.  I felt as if I had this pure ball of happiness inside of my chest that had me smiling from ear to ear.  And it had nothing to do with my love of the great physical high that I was feeling (the famous “shutter-visioned” high).  It had more to do with the complete understanding and acceptance of how awesome my life is.  Now don’t take this in as a brag, anybody can have the same feeling regardless of where they are in there lives.  What I felt was the ability to take nothing for granted, I was thankful and I appreciated everything all around me.  This beautiful, but I remembered the feeling very well in the following weeks. It had a strong impact on me is what I’m trying to say.  And because I remembered it, where eating can be an experience to love
It’s this kind of person who loves and lives life to it’s upmost potential and it the kind of person I think everyone is capable of and who I think you,

I feel there are a massive amount of people out there who truly want to contribute to trying to legalize cannabis in their community but don't know how they can do it. They either don't know where to start, how much free time you have, your age, or anything else.

**General tips:**

* **ABOVE ALL ELSE, whether it be about health, public policy, sociology, race, botany, psychiatry,. Check out the 'Further Reading and Information' for a good place to start.

* **You're going to have to be bold.** Regardless of the level of involvement, it will enrich your life and make you a deeper and more productive human being. 

* **We're allowed to disagree with each other as a movement.** We can disagree on the details of what the post-legalization world will be like and how the future laws will be

* **We have to be willing to compromise to a degree.** One of the reasons alcohol prohibition failed (other than it being a terrible idea)

* **Don't lie or make up statistics.** We don't need to stoop to the prohibitionist's level. If someone makes a good point, don't claim cannabis will solve all our worldly problems, and make sure your stats and argument have a legitimate source to back them up.


**Organizations**:

* [Drug Policy Alliance](http://www.drugpolicy.org): A very influential organization that works towards making policies regarding all drugs based in science, the DPA, to put it simply, has their shit together. On Cannabis..:
&gt; The Drug Policy Alliance advocates for the elimination of criminal penalties for the adult use of marijuana
&gt; DPA’s reform advocacy includes drafting and promoting state and federal marijuana laws, high-profile media work, and providing legal, policy, and communications resources and expertise to patients, activists, journalists, and elected officials.  We supply honest, and smart policy alternatives to the failed prohibitionist approach.


* [Students for Sensible Drug Policy(SSDP)](http://ssdp.org/): An International organization for  looking to end the War on Drugs. From their website:
&gt; We are the only international network of students dedicated to ending the war on drugs.  At heart

SSDP does an amazing job at pushing the envelope while still being respected by school administrations. They basically aim to operate in such a respectable and classy manner that schools have little to do but respect their right to speak openly, and you may be able to get funding to attend these conferences from your school if you're organization is school-recognized.

* [Marijuana Policy Project(MPP)](http://www.mpp.org/): From wikipedia:
&gt;The Marijuana Policy Project, number of members, and staff. Its stated aims are to: (1) increase public support for non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies; (2) identify and activate supporters of non-punitive, non-coercive marijuana policies; (3) change state laws to reduce or eliminate penalties for the medical and non-medical use of marijuana; and (4) gain influence in Congress.

* [National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws(NORML)](http://norml.org/): One of the oldest and well known pro-cannabis groups
&gt; Since its founding in 1970

* [Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies(MAPS)](http://www.maps.org/about/mission/):
&gt; MAPS' mission is (1) to treat conditions for which conventional medicines provide limited relief—such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety and depression associated with end-of-life issues—by developing psychedelics and marijuana into prescription medicines; (2) to treat many thousands of people by building a network of clinics where treatments can be provided; and (3) to educate the public honestly about the risks and benefits of psychedelics and marijuana.
MAPS is founded by [Dr. Rick Doblin](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rick_Doblin)

* [Law Enforcement Against Prohibition (LEAP)](http://www.leap.cc): An organization comprised of current and former law enforcement officials who are against the War on Drugs.  From their site:
&gt; We believe that drug prohibition is the true cause of much of the social and personal  damage that has historically been attributed to drug use. It is prohibition that makes these drugs so valuable –  while giving criminals a monopoly over their supply. Driven by the huge profits from this monopoly, and children. Their trade is unregulated and they are, therefore, beyond our control.


* [Moms for Marijuana](http://www.momsformarijuana.com/):
&gt;Moms for Marijuana is a grassroots network and organization of parents and other citizens across the world who are concerned with the ignorant war that continues to be fought against the Cannabis (Hemp or Marijuana) plant

**How you can help:**

* **As mentioned before

* **Lobby politicians.** You may have an opinion on the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of your government officials, and contact your legislators in a variety of ways in support of pro-cannabis bills. They actually do listen to their constituents many times, as they want to be re-elected and often have no strong opinion one way or the other on many bills. Present yourself in a respectable manner and rely on logic and statistics, and even if they refuse to listen, they'll look bad to the neutral observer.

* **Help educate the public.** Counter any ignorance you find online or in real life. If you feel comfortable enough, and other events. And most importantly, encourage your friends to get involved and educate them. 

* **Speak with your wallet.** Even if you don't have the time or abilities to get involved

Everyone has seen the viral posts that people spread on Facebook to support things such as breast cancer awareness. I think we should raise awareness for the legalization of cannabis this 4/20 by all posting some true facts on our Facebooks. 

I have compiled a list of 10 facts about marijuana that many people don't know, scientific sources for each one. Here is the list I have made, with a short introduction. 

Today is 4/20, cannabis prohibition is still being fully enforced. Considering the relatively safe nature of cannabis, prohibition is a gross infringement on our civil rights. Remember, you don't have to be a marijuana smoker to realize that prohibition is completely unjust. Here is a list of 10 TRUE facts about marijuana, just a few of the many reasons why cannabis should be legalized. 

1: Marijuana has never caused a single death in almost 5000 years of recorded use. Where as Alcohol kills 85,000 people a year. 
Sources: http://www.ukcia.org/culture/history/chrono.php

2: Marijuana does NOT kill brain cells. This myth stems from falsified experiments/studies in the 1960's

3: Marijuana is NOT a physically addictive drug. Its use can be habitual, will not suffer any physical withdrawal symptoms. Although Some chronic daily users might notice some symptoms from discontinue use due to the changing states of consciousness, such as loss of appetite and trouble sleeping. This is akin, but less severe, to a coffee drinker stopping caffeine intake. 

4: Marijuana is NOT a gateway drug. Many studies have proven that There is no property of the plant that makes the user more prone to use other substances. It can, where dealers can offer the buyer other 'harder' drugs when purchasing marijuana. Legalization greatly reduce this risk. 
Sources: http://www.drugpolicy.org/facts/drug-facts/marijuana-facts

5: Marijuana does NOT lead to mouth / lung cancer. Although all smoke contains carcinogens, with alternatives such as edibles and vaporization. Recent medical studies have actual shown that marijuana use can slow, and even reverse the growth of cancerous tumors. 
Sources: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/25/AR2006052501729.html


6: Marijuana has been proven to be an effective treatment to many physical and mental diseases. It is often able to remove the need for, Crohns disease, anxiety, PTSD, glaucoma, and depression. 

7: The prohibition of marijuana costs the US $7.7 billion a year. If it was regulated and taxed like alcohol or tobacco, and savings from law enforcement and prison costs for arresting and prosecuting non-violent marijuana related crimes. 
Sources: http://www.drugsense.org/cms/wodclock

8: The hemp plant has a wide variety of uses. From textiles, to livestock food, and bio fuels. 

9: 8 out of 10 of The states that have already legalized medical cannabis have seen a decrease in youth (ages 12-17) usage. Government regulation removes business from the black market

10: People under the influence marijuana are much

I had my mflb on me, he could walk around without pain, and his hands stopped shaking. He shed a few man tears, nothing I could hold against him. He thanked me profusely, and apologized for how he treated me. At that point what anger I still had fell away. It stopped mattering at all. I started crying, too. I told him it was alright, I hadn't been the easiest kid to raise. I said what he did made me who I am and without it I might not be as strong as I am. I had realized he, forged me into the man I am. I forgave him then and there and it feels like a mountain's fallen off my chest. Then he made us burgers and fries and we munched the hell out while watching pawn stars.

Most of this will only be applicable to people living in non-legal states

First be aware that what you are doing is illegal, and most people just don't care if you smoke. However, the police do care, and if you are arrested you will be put in jail and it is going to cost you a lot of money (I have been arrested for possession of less than an ounce twice and after all was said and done I have spent over $10,000.00 as a result). Furthermore it is difficult to keep off your record, and even if a charge is expunged, law enforcement still keeps a record of it and it will be used against you.

Know that if you are not smoking in the privacy of your own home, and even then try to be discreet about it as you never know who may come walking up. I was in the middle of the woods camping at night in what I thought was a remote location, when park rangers accompanied by a drug task force agent came out of the woods, saw my friend rolling one up, and arrested both of us for less than a gram. Now I prefer to take edibles with me on camping trips as they are much harder to detect without a dog.

Just because you don't have anything on you doesn't mean you won't  get arrested. Be careful who you are around as their unsafe habits can get you busted. I was a passenger in a car, and myself for possession, despite the fact that she claimed it was all hers at the time. If it is within reach, you can legally be charged with possession.

No matter how much you may know or like the person

Speaking of lawyers, a big shot who i paid top dollar for, passed me off to some lackey attorney in his practice and wouldn't represent me himself. I had no confidence in the attorney I was stuck with to win my case and ended up taking a plea deal. Attorneys will tell you up front that you have a winnable case in court regardless, because they want you to hire them, but once they are paid, the last thing they want to do is go to court. It takes more of their time and effort, and they would much rather that you take a deal because it is less work for them. Ask questions up front and get satisfactory answers

Finally, especially if you, or anyone with you is intoxicated. Later in the evening cops are out actively looking for people who are drunk/high and your odds of getting busted are much higher than in the day time. Also if you are going to drive stoned, do not have anything on you. Leave that shit at the house and it will be waiting for you when you get back. 

Remember as Gandalf would say

Fast forward to today, they need her to come in for more additional testing *in three months*. Three months of sitting around thinking,"" Gee, I hope my wife doesn't have cancer. I sure hope she quits smoking ciggs this time.""

I hate the stress this is putting on my life, but we both smoke weed on a daily basis (while watching cartoons and generally loving each other); having kids would mean saying goodbye to all of those things forever. I'm glad the doctor said that worse case scenario this can probably be surgically removed without being life threatening, but the entire ordeal is really stressing me out and making it hard to focus on my work (which is life-threateningly dangerous, focus is important). 

tl;dr: **my wife needs to quit smoking ciggs because of her multiple irregular obgyn tests. I love her and the cancer scares are stressing me out.**

1359423979.0,17guss,If you like having cannabis be illegal then do not read this post,pstuart,181,52,146,"I'm trying this yet again on reddit

Even though I say it below

Sorry for shouting

Forgive the wall of text

The DEA recently refused to remove cannabis from Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act. They deem it to have no medical value that it has serious risk of abuse and harm. This is the same category that includes heroin. 

A majority of the population disagrees with that assessment. There have been many petitions to the White House to redress this, or what he believes in, I encourage you to google him and take a look.

I am trying to take a different tactic. I have submitted a petition to the White House to make alcohol a Schedule I drug as well. Before I share the text of the petition here

  - first and foremost
  - secondly
  - the denial of the petition would require some statement on record of why a dangerous drug should be allowed to be used recreationally
  - any mention of ""drugs"" will be met with the same non-response: they are bad
  - the petition is as brief as possible (save for the obligatory ""think of the children"" bit at the end). This is to minimize any spurious issue that they can focus on and deny
  - the 18th Amendment is used as a model for this reasoning (this enacted Prohibition). This is the only Amendment to ever be repealed.
  - the 18th Amendment is used at ""face value"" to require it to be repudiated by the responder
  - lastly

So far I've been met with the following responses:

  - I don't want to sign something that I don't believe in (making alcohol illegal)
  - petitions are a waste of time
  - but I like alcohol!
  - I see your reasoning but I don't smoke cannabis so I don't care

So why do this, just maybe,
the response might be useful later in the repudiation of the existing policy. And it can't hurt to try.

The following is the text of the petition itself

------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Make alcohol a Schedule I drug under the Controlled Substances Act. Being that alcohol has no redeeming medical value and currently is estimated to kill at least 80

Making alcohol illegal will reduce crime and curtail consumption

In order to protect our children from this danger it is imperative that we act quickly to stop this menace from doing any more damage.

The real reason is that I'm sick and tired of buying from dealers (and it is becoming harder and harder to do so). I am a software engineer in my late 20s and none of my friends have connections anymore - I was only able to buy occasionally from a ""friend of a friend of a friend"". It would take hours of calling, and then he'd get all annoyed that I didn't want to smoke a bowl with him after (I drove there and don't like driving high and reeking of weed). In general I find that now that I'm a few years out of college, I don't like associating with dealers - they're shady, unprofessional and not discreet, and often involved in harder drugs.

Not to mention the legal aspect of it. I have a good career, I still don't like to do anything to jeopardize my family or career. I still really enjoy cannabis - its a great way to unwind from a long day at work and I'm finding that I much prefer it to alcohol (no hangover and no calories). With my MMJ authorization, I can now walk down to my friendly neighborhood dispensary, pick up a variety of strains or exotic edibles, and then walk back home without worrying about carrying weed around in my car and getting pulled over. I no longer have to buy a lot and stockpile it because I now have a near-guaranteed supply, and it's always very high quality.

The only issue is that I feel strongly about legalization and I worry that it is unethical to ""abuse"" the current MMJ system like this and could hurt the legalization cause if there are too many others like me (I put scare quotes around ""abuse"" because I don't really believe it is harmful to myself or anyone else to do this

In the last couple of years I started smoking cannabis

I became Diddlesnap's most regular hook-up,* so all the friends I sold to would be annoyed or offended that he got a better deal than them. Yes, this guy could really be a douchebag.

But the worst part was that Diddlesnaps had no concept of being discreet

I finally lost my patience this week when I was at work

The next day I told him I wouldn't be selling to him anymore, and hasn't spoken to me since.

I'm sure the general consensus will be ""Good riddance, he had been a great friend.

The answer, I do what I want!""  If we ever want cannabis to be legal, we need to show society that we're responsible about it even while it's illegal.  This is why we generally discourage teen use, smoking and driving, and otherwise just being an inconsiderate ass-hat about it.  We try to show that cannabis use can be conducive to productive, creative activity, and a person is perfectly capable of making sound decisions under the influence of it.  We act almost as if it's legal already and that there are just certain rules we have to abide by as responsible citizens.  We have to use it in a way that is exemplary to society if they are ever to consider it a legitimate activity.  

One could argue, but I doubt any of us would have a clue who Rosa Parks was if she had just said ""Well I'd better get to the back of this bus.  It's never ok to break the law no matter what!""  No.  She stayed put and openly defied the law, but I don't think there's a civilized person living today who wouldn't say that *she* was right and the *law* was wrong.  The Civil Rights Movement wouldn't have been nearly as effective without civil disobedience like this.  It was a clear-cut example of the people nullifying an unjust rule and replacing it with their own.  In hindsight it was obviously legitimate and those who participated are American heroes, but at the time they got the dogs and the fire hoses.  They were just ""those wild niggers"" on the news that the ""civilized"" people shook their heads at from their white-bred living rooms.  Again, I'm not trying to totally equate that struggle with ours.  Smoking weed is obviously a choice; being black isn't.  Are you seeing the parallels though?  

In civilized society, how would anyone know weed isn't the devil in plant form like the government says it is if it weren't for the people who didn't listen and smoked it anyway?  What would have happened to all the medical marijuana patients had everyone in the world just taken the federal government's word for it that it has ""no medical value?""  We're doing more than just getting our kicks, society be damned.  We're straining for justice for ourselves and for everyone else, which I find it hard to consider ""immoral"".

So a few months ago I was smoking quite a bit. During this time I was drinking a lot of coffee/caffeinated beverages (energy drinks), not necessarily as habit. I needed dip to feel normal/not irritable during the day; it sucked. 

When I was addicted to the dip and consuming all of this caffeine, I always got very depressed, and weed turned into something that just was not fun anymore. So I stopped for a while.

Fast forward to about two weeks ago. I decided to give up caffeine and dip. I haven't dipped in about 2 weeks, I didn't once think about anything depressing, and I didn't really get tired at all. It was everything I missed and everything I need in a high.

Now I'm not 100% sure that this lack of dip and caffeine is what made my high so enjoyable, and maybe cut some stuff out. You never know what could help.

I've been a long time lurker and have seen some great advice given out in this subreddit. It just so happens that I am in need of some now.

My best friend of the last 15 years will be coming up to my house this weekend. We both live in different states so it will be the first time he's been up here in 6 months. We have a very close relationship in that we've both been through some hard times together and can relate to each other on that. 

However about 4 years ago he went to rehab for abuse of prescription pain killers. I knew he used them once in a while but didn't know that it spawned into a daily habit. When he told me

Long story short, and he still smokes though he's not much of a drinker. Except I feel like his smoking is getting a bit out of control. I can see his traits as an addict start to take form of his smoking habits. 

For example, we're both nearing 30). His family knows he smokes, but I feel they would rather have him be doing that then the pills he was doing 4 years ago (as would I).

But I'm worried about him and don't know how to talk to him about it without coming across as hypocritical. I smoke too, just because I don't see a point. But I digress...

So he's coming up tonight

I will smoke with him

Mason jars are used for pickling

They collect kief that can be brushed out.

They almost completely eliminate any ability for humans to smell through the jar. Scientifically they do not eliminate smell, and the other doesn't smell like anything.

The herb that goes into the jar comes out of the jar in the same state it goes in. That is to say it doesn't dry out and become flakey like in the bags

One thing to note is that you want to get as much air out of the jar as possible so if you can fill it with a lot of herb good. Alls to say a smaller jar for smaller amounts is better.

Mason jars come in lots of sizes.

Here's a pro tip. When you buy your mason jars

Put the herb filled mason jar back in amongst all the others and since it wont smell it will look like you just bought a bunch of mason jars ect...

&gt; Decision-making and risk-taking problems aren’t necessarily evident immediately after smoking; however, particularly if heavy use was initiated in adolescence such that maturation of executive functions was not achieved. Acute cannabis use impairs inhibition and promotes impulsivity, and over a period of abstinence, these deficits are most evident in tasks that require concept formation, planning and sequencing abilities. Working memory is significantly impaired following acute exposure to cannabis; however, these deficits resolve with sustained abstinence. Evidence is less clear in regards to verbal fluency abilities; however, research suggests that chronic, heavy cannabis users, decision-making

&gt;Together, this study had some bias, such as low level of cannabis use and the lack of evaluation of cannabis use after inclusion. For the six other studies, data show the existence of a significant association between cannabis use and psychotic disorders (with an increased risk between 1.2 and 2.8 in Zammit et al.'s study), particularly among vulnerable individuals (that is with a prepsychotic state at the time of inclusion). Therefore, all the studies that assessed a dose-effect relationship showed this link between cannabis use and the emergence of psychosis or psychotic symptoms. The fact that all causal criteria were present in the studies suggests that cannabis use may be an independent risk factor for the development of psychosis. Results seem to be more consistent for vulnerable individuals with the hypothesis that cannabis use may precipitate psychosis, notably among vulnerable subjects. In particular

Allowing states to determine their own marijuana policy conflicts with Congress' authority to regulate interstate commerce and Supreme Court precedent.  Instead of encouraging the use of marijuana

1361592192.0,192aqj,First time growing &amp; trying cannabis + some pictures from the grow,throwaway_account_02,110,9,19,"I apologize beforehand for my lack of grammar knowledge and poor sentence aesthetics.

**FIRST PART: Introduction and a sob story**

My country of origin is a small post soviet shithole called Latvia. Keeping or growing Cannabis plants containing more than 0.2% THC is considered severe crime and such act can and will be punished with up to 15 years in prison and complimentary property confiscation. It's legal to grow and cultivate hemp

The idea of growing Cannabis came to me after quitting job and simply browsing random message boards on the internet while drunk. The concept of growing it seemed very simple and I was curious. Seems like alcohol can be as effective gateway drug as Cannabis.

At some point in life I considered that working hard, putting enough food on the table and having a feeling of self-complacence as an individual and part of a functioning society. Turns out I was wrong.

I had a white collar job in accounting with some manual labor aspects. I psychologically burned out at the point where I was working 80 hour work weeks with hourly salary equivalent to 1.14 USD or 0.85 EUR ""after taxes"". My employer paid roughly half of my social security taxes he was legally supposed to, having something to eat, being clothed accordingly to your professional status, having a full set of healthy visible teeth and most importantly, pretending to be optimistic about your work duties and life. 

I'll admit that some of the living costs here are relatively cheaper when compared to other more developed countries

Anyway, my degenerate employer was openly doing tax fraud and helping to realize some small time money laundering scheme, but you can't really take that to court if you want to keep your professional reputation intact.

&gt; In summary: I quit my job because of the pressure

Of course there are few people in my country that do have civilized work conditions and reasonable salaries

In my 20-something years of life I have come to the conclusion that I fucking hate my country and its retarded mentality.

**SECOND PART: Grow diary and first time impressions**

I bought my seeds from ""Pick 'n' Mix Seed Bank"" because they had some good reviews and would sell even a single seed per order. I made the payment using my personal debit card and can confirm that the transaction description is very neutral. Also there is no sign of card fraud up to this date. They use standard

It seems that customs rarely check the shipments from within EU and getting your seeds found in random close-up examination has chances of winning small fortune in a lottery.
Here are some pictures of the parcel and seed packaging:
[(Picture of parcel front)](http://i.imgur.com/nMh2llN.jpg)
[(Picture of parcel back)](http://i.imgur.com/fgoVjjl.jpg)
[(Picture of seed packaging)](http://i.imgur.com/wxBYEgJ.jpg)

So I bought 3 feminized seeds:
1) Seedbank: Nirvana
2) Seedbank: Delicious
3) Seedbank: Bomb

I chose autoflowering strains because I was doing partial outside grow with good 2 months before first frosts and these strains promised times from seed to harvest in around 60 days. I should mention that I chose very bad timing for outside grow that would completely depend on sunlight.

Two of my seeds were germinated in wet paper towels and the plant sprouting time was longer when compared to the seed that was put straight into the soil.
[(Picture of sprouted seed before putting it in a pot)](http://i.imgur.com/3Rw9dXt.jpg)
[(Day 5 from seed)](http://i.imgur.com/Nx5yXQf.jpg)

These plants stretched quite a bit because of the lack of sunlight.
[(Day 14 from seed: Blue Mystic)](http://i.imgur.com/1xMr1K1.jpg)
[(Day 14 from seed: Auto Bomb)](http://i.imgur.com/mECjcvK.jpg)
[(Day 14 from seed: La Diva)](http://i.imgur.com/xgMT0NX.jpg)
[(Day 15 from seed: All plants together)](http://i.imgur.com/tbHrvNj.jpg)

Around this time my plants really started to gain weight as I started using nutrients in small amounts.
[(Day 25 from seed: Blue Mystic)](http://i.imgur.com/tmrHbXk.jpg)
[(Day 25 from seed: La Diva)](http://i.imgur.com/0YzG6zn.jpg)
[(Day 25 from seed: Auto Bomb)](http://i.imgur.com/KHHgfsn.jpg)
[(Day 25 from seed: All plants together)](http://i.imgur.com/zLmGoJN.jpg)

At this point I was happy to confirm that all three plants indeed were female. They also had some faint odor. Feminized seeds have something like 99% chance of plant being female thus saving space and grow resources.
[(Day 31 from seed: Some of the first preflowers on La Diva)](http://i.imgur.com/Ha9AInY.jpg)
[(Day 32 from seed: All plants together)](http://i.imgur.com/Ptd7xkP.jpg)

As the flowering progressed
[(Day 44 from seed: Early flowering)](http://i.imgur.com/3DD1yUj.jpg)

Around this time I started flushing La Diva and Auto Bomb plants. Trough the vegetation and flowering I was using liquid fertilizer for flowering plants in combination with some multi purpose fertilizer in form of white pellets
[(Day 56 from seed: La Diva Flowering)](http://i.imgur.com/s6Ibaqv.jpg)

As some of the buds had matured for the first harvest
[(Day 63 from seed: Auto Bomb flowering)](http://i.imgur.com/CNWWdQP.jpg)
[(Day 63 from seed: Auto Blue Mystic flowering)](http://i.imgur.com/2vZc5Xg.jpg)

At the day of harvesting first buds an adder came checking up on my progress. :D I managed to take a few good shots. Well
[(Adder 1)](http://i.imgur.com/Fy8V8S0.jpg)
[(Adder 2)](http://i.imgur.com/8J6sqST.jpg)

La Diva and Auto Bomb had first mature buds around 60^th day after seed. With more light getting to the lowest branches rest of them matured within one week. Blue Mystic actually had longer vegetation period and first pickable bud was around 70^th day.

When drying the buds a single seed fell out. It's a cross between La Diva and random hemp plant. [(Worthless

[(Picture of root systems in no particular order)](http://i.imgur.com/BGoL4uQ.jpg)

Because of the mold I lost very much of my potential yield. Shamefully, but it has very shady origin and distinctive acetone smell. And these are the same gypsies that could be mugging me on the street using a mother fucking scalpel, but I digress.

Auto Blue Mystic turned out to have the biggest yield and the best mold resistance. As you can see in the picture below
[(Average look of dry nug from Blue Mystic)](http://i.imgur.com/HnJdhjg.jpg)

All of the trimmings with clearly visible trichomes and molded buds were used to make cannabutter. In total I used 13 grams of trichome covered goodness. The only negative aspect about cannabutter is the awful smell when making it, but you only need to add very little of it to any recipe that won't suffer from butter or originally has it in it. When cooking with cannabutter you should avoid too high temperatures as it does degrade its potency. Eating some cannabutter cookies for breakfast would let me experience the high for the entire day so edibles are my favorite in terms of discretion and ease of usage.

First time smoking weed I used carved out stem from my biggest Cannabis plant. It worked great as a small one hitter, but I can't say it was bad as long as I was inhaling it lightly and drawing some clean air along with the smoke. I would love to try vaporizing, but it's something I simply can't imagine affording and makeshift vaporizers seem more like a waste of time and resources.

I think I share the thoughts of majority when I say that using Cannabis for recreational purposes simply makes everything better. Unhealthy obsession with food aside, anxiety and instead allows me to focus on everything good at the present moment. The high is bit lazy, but when having the right motivation, I found myself able to be more creative in ways that I didn't expect from myself, while being relatively shallow personality in everyday life. I'm pretty interested in trying different strains, especially something more sativa dominant.

I believe that using Cannabis recreationally is a great way to relax and feel good at the end of a hard week or month

I don't understand why the fact of alcohol being legal in a country isn't sufficient ground for legalizing or at least decriminalizing Cannabis in the same country? Alcohol is a toxic depressant and is perfectly legal and socially acceptable almost worldwide. Alcohol abuse creates much more suffering to the people around the abuser when compared to Cannabis. People don't die from overdosing and are less likely to become violent or completely inadequate while under the influence of Cannabis. In my opinion it would make more sense to either make alcohol illegal as well or completely legalize Cannabis for recreational use. The fact that so many people use cannabis despite the legal consequences that can potentially ruin their lives proves that intimidation and punishment doesn't justify their purpose. Until then

Since experiencing Cannabis high I have drastically changed my view on alcohol. I don't crave for a drink like I used to. Now I rather smoke/eat Cannabis every other week or month while having a stash that would let me get high every day if I wanted to for a single month or a bit less, having a bottle of alcohol simply lying around wouldn't survive more than a day before I would succumb to the temptation. At least in my case Cannabis is the lesser evil if I'm lucky enough to evade the potential legal consequences.

&gt;In summary: Even a complete moron can grow Cannabis with arguably successful results. I neglected my plants in terms of optimal light, proper soil and fertilization, but they still turned out good enough to make me high countless times. Before trying Cannabis, I felt unconcerned about this topic, but now I understand that prosecuting Cannabis users and those who grow for personal use does more damage than decriminalization or even legalization would do.

Here are some additional flower pictures from my grow:

For those reasons, we informed the landlord that we would be late making the payment. The landlord seemed to accept!

Meanwhile the police has contacted our landlord, that they face 4 years imprisonment for letting us rent the place. Which naturally worries the landlords a group of 4 partners, so they decided to send us a letter asking for the rent money immediately or face being thrown out.

I want to let you all know, on that day he found a big piece of hash and in front of everybody he put it in his pocket. 30 minutes later, Bjarne gave back the hash telling us all that they would leave us alone, since our work is harmless, not that criminal and maybe even a help for the police and politicians fight against hardcore gangs.

So Bjarne broke his own laws, people that I do not even know who are??? I think he is one evil person, a real threat to any civilized society and I got some of that shit on TAPE - be my guest media!

So what I want to say!

If I do not pay up NOW, they have to take me to court before making me leave the adress.

My lawyers say PAY NOW , it is empty threats and an abuse of power.

But you see, utility bills and other payments that are needed.

THEN - came Danish comedian Omar Marzouk and offered to give me 5.000DKR, it hit us like a hammer to the face. And it is not even an question of the police getting us shut down, it ijust money issues. So those must be fixed. As Omar and VU ÅRHUS told you all, please support us to raise this money. We need it and we need it because then we can continue the freedom fight that we are fighting.

They decided to use dirty tricks and threats

**TL;DR;** Dude opens a coffeeshop in Denmark and tells everyone he's going to sell weed and run it after the dutch model. 

The Police, pretty much tell him that they don't (and can't) directly support him, but won't crack down on him, as long as he keeps it nice and tidy. The police even visit him a couple of times, take some weed, and the give it back to him, telling him that they like what he's doing

1 weeks time ago they made a 180 and all of a sudden the police raided the shop, even though they would never be able to sentence them in Danish court. So now the landlords want the coffeeshop to pay up before friday (the 20th), or they will cancel the lease :(

This is corruption and blackmail on the bad end of the scale, and maybe buy themselves out :)",,False,self,t5_2tclf,False,,

I used to post on another forum before I came to Reddit earlier this year, I ventured off and found a fantastic place to call home.  A place where we can freely discuss pot, share pictures, and all that.

However, and eventually, we all began to bond.  It was great.  And as such, we all became friends.  One time, we bought one of the guys in the chat a 5 lb gummy worm, and he ate it on cam.  I mean, it was fucking rad.

So how about we set up something like that?  Let's get together on a chat system where you can decide to reveal your identity, it's the ultimate in privacy.

I am very happy to be able to bring you this adventure

I was excited to be at the 30th anniversary of the fabled 1967 Summer Of Love, and I certainly had no inkling of my future self as Old Hippie.

I wrote most of this up the same night it happened (except the last paragraph), but it was password-protected to keep it out of the prying eyes of search engines (they had those too!). So only my closest friends — less than a dozen people — have ever read this before today.

After I started writing as Old Hippie, although I knew I had saved it. Finally, I discovered it in a ZIPped archive that I had made last century, and knew I had to share it with you. Today.

Notes:

* My sons were 3 and 8 at the time.
* I’ve left everything exactly as it was in the 1997 original, which made it very hard to read. However, [I have preserved that background here for posterity](http://askoldhippie.com/).
* I know you’ll want the recipe. I haven’t tried it yet
* My biggest surprise was that the Summer Of Love website is still up and running and looking great!

Nugs and hugs forever
Old Hippie

In the last 3 months

The anxiety is all about work, and our definition of life and work is very blurred. My expectation on what I should be doing and how productive I should be becomes at odd with my perception of reality when I'm high and it just fucks me up.

I'm from India; it is relatively easy and safe to get Cannabis

My paranoia also stems from my perception of my own weirdness and insecurity. I'm insecure in how I worry other people perceive me. I'm also worried about being a cog in this huge machine of reality and being unable to influence it. The sad part of all this is that I'm actually reasonably successful at what I do, the tweets I made and think that they are yucky/immature and start worrying how other random people on the internet perceive my words. I consider all of them as 'mature normal adults' judging me and my weirdness. But in my sober state I can tell you that in the scale of 1-10 of Reddit eccentricity/weirdness, I am probably a 4.

The complete guide to not giving a fuck is the kind of article I need to assimilate to get over my anxiety (http://inoveryourhead.net/the-complete-guide-to-not-giving-a-fuck/)

I have also noticed that my mood becomes really sullen and depressed for a couple of days after smoking. It improves gradually as I keep away. I also start experiencing high BP which stays with me for a couple of days. Also

I'm leaving my current job in a month and going off and living/working by myself for a while. It involves a change of scene and I wont have access to cannabis then. I also will be away from my work

Do you have any thoughts on this? One of my worries is whether I'm running away. I'm also wondering whether I might have a chance of developing schizophrenia and cannabis is accelerating it. Do you have any reassurances? Do you look back at the anxious periods of your life and think that the anxiety was stupid? How eccentric do you think you are? Does that ever affect you? Do you have any thought patterns that would help me.

After over a month of research and some serious internet crawling I decided on the Arizer Extreme Q v4.0 2012 model.  Fortunately I've found all my researched backed by some great posts right here on reddit and I'll be linking to those posts.  I purchased mine with the warranty in tact from ebay for under $150.
Link to eBay listing: http://bit.ly/XcYh79

I suggest scoping out the right hand column over at /r/arizer for tons of info on how to clean your device and what temperatures seem to work best (especially useful if you buy an older model EQ.

I prefer to use the bags

I also recommend purchasing a decent grinder to get a nice fine grind: 
http://www.reddit.com/r/arizer/comments/rthso/find_a_grinder_online/

Consider replacing the PVC piping with surgical silicone tubing

This leads us to ABV (Already Been Vaped).  My first vaporizer was a no-name box vape from a noname eBay seller which only lasted about 3 months and was prone to catching my herb on fire (well smoldering in the glass).  We used to call ABV ""second rounds"" as we would go back and vape it again later at a higher temperature then toss it out when it was nearly blackened.

I've learned lots of things from my research on the internet, don't forget the soy lecithin, it's very important!  Here's a link to Bit_Chewy's awesome recipe: http://www.reddit.com/r/abv/comments/16q9hl/my_abv_recipe_with_coconut_oil_and_soy_lecithin/

Using coconut oil and soy lecithin avoids a lot of the variability of our digestive system as described in this article by an awesome eldertree OldHippie: http://beyondchronic.com/2012/08/capsule-warning-avb-experiment-wrong/
To avoid the first pass problems you should eat at least 30-60 minutes before taking the coconut oil capsules

Soy lecithin granules and size 00 gelatin capsules can be purchased at health food or vitamin stores or Amazon.  High quality coconut oil at most grocery stores.

http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/21138215/hawaii-house-committee-to-vote-on-marijuana


There was no vote.  One man made the decision.  


There has been a divide among the people of this nation for many years now about the potential legalizing of cannabis.  Recently, economists, judges, farmers, enthusiasts, and unemployed people that could tell you about the many benefits cannabis could have for our society.  I won't get into that here...  Except to say that whether you are for, against, you should watch the video:


[The Union: The Business of Getting High](http://youtu.be/6jO_ncXj7RE)


Learn something.  Keep an open mind and then

&gt;No

If we look at this person's concern realistically and compassionately, make smoking legal in a private setting.  Not out on the street corner, in the grocery store, or at Burger King.  As to the nurses and bus drivers, I agree.  I don't want these people to be high on the job either.  That's why there will be laws and regulations in place to prevent this.  You have no more right to show up to work blazed up than you do showing up sloshed from drinking a bottle of vodka. What needs to be understood in this situation is the fact that the people who would come to work high in a state that has legal cannabis, are the people who would come to work high regardless of the law.  You will be no more vulnerable to this situation than you were before.

Now, why would anyone really care if I smoke/vaporize/eat/plant/harvest/juggle/stare at/sleep on/or play baseball with the buds of a plant?  Why is this even an issue to people?  I have total respect for people that don't like the smell or, like the comment above, have trouble being around the smoke.  I wouldn't impose myself on these people.  Much the same as when I used to smoke cigarettes and would go outside if it bothered anyone.  I don't drink and drive.  Hell, I don't even like drinking very much and probably wouldn't if cannabis was legal.  For people that have a problem with legalization, I ask, where do you draw the line?  Do you drink alcohol?  Because, it is very dangerous not only for you, but the people around you.  Do you have sex?  Because, these things aren't the same.  Yes

Salutations everyone

For a year straight I've been eating raw cannabis for my asthma and I would like to share the results. First the video and doctor that spurred this idea deserves recognition. While learning more about cannabis last year I came across a video called [Leaf](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qa0nLdVJiIg) (15min)

On November 5th 2011 (a Saturday) I wanted to first test what eating would do to me. So I could ensure it would not interfere with work. Mind you I don't have the quantities described in the linked video. Additionally I get cannabis, but generally warmer.

During the first days I noticed my circulation was getting better and my metabolism was speeding up. The first majorly

Being able to breathe better, don't think I started doing this pace. I slowly began with 10 minute miles and worked up the pace every two weeks.

While doing my exercise routine I also felt how food impacted my runs. I eliminated soda and drinks with High Fructose Corn Syrup. Two out of three meals during the week are vegetarian, and (subtle) trachea inflammation changes were before these exercise/diet changes.

In the later months is when my trachea inflammation started to loosen greatly. I was starting to cough and produce saliva differently. I noticed when I took water bong hits and coughed

Lastly

If you have any questions I'll try to answer them the best I can while at work. If you know anyone with a respiratory problem

*Side notes from my logs*: 

I did this with only Sativa strains. Indica strains gave me a headache after eating them

When I began exercising I noticed on days I ate cannabis and tried to exercise immediately after

Be kind with grammar as the text hasn't been very revised&gt; Back story: My mom suffers from Fibromyalgia, and more... My sister chose hard drugs and crime for some reason so my mom attributes trees as the gateway. I want to make her better to treat her constant debilitating pain and I think trees is the most practical answer... Read on for the letter Thanks in advance

Dear Mom, I have a fully functioning and rather enhanced life from cannabis. Would it be wrong for me to say that I prefer the cannabis to treat my depression and help me cope with my emotional instabilities in a manner that no counselor or medicine has ever done for me before? Maybe I should start by saying that I am still against cigarettes and their ravages on the body but I still consume cannabis. How about that I love my daughter more and more and realize how important she should really be to me because cannabis allows me to truly sort out my emotions. Most importantly though I will state this clearly, cannabis is not my gateway to the hard drugs like crack and heroin. I love myself, my family, and my body too much to put it through what those drugs can do to you. Jensen’s drug abuse and crime are a special case that speaks more so to her psychological predispositions as compared to her use of cannabis in high school. I whole-heartedly support the decriminalization of cannabis and the regulation of it to keep it out of young children’s hands. It is the same as alcohol and tobacco in my eyes. Children shouldn’t partake in cigarettes, alcohol, or marijuana but I believe that consenting adults have the right to choose for themselves, then read the articles (all of which are attached to this document)

{A.D.D. Thought Break!}

I recommend watching this documentary before reading further into my research. It becomes obvious the prejudices that taint peoples mind in the face of facts that have been long kept illegal. Also the trillion dollar pharmaceutical industry that you contribute to on a daily basis has had major influence on keeping cannabis illegal. They don’t want a medicine that can be simply grown in the ground getting out and tainting their market. Momma, I know something needs to change. I miss having my mom who always wanted to be there and I miss seeing you not in pain. I know that based on our families history that your moral prejudices will probably kick in and you will feel as though you are betraying society or becoming a bad person! Mom, that is far from the truth! In my opinion If it is a treatment that is effective in combatting the pain, helping you sleep at night, and getting you back into life then I am all for it. Honestly all that I have ever seen in the drugs you take is a fog that transcends your conscious mind. It has really made me question the effectiveness of modern medicines especially given my major and possible career fields. I have always believed in the natural approach, I really don’t like doctors who always over prescribe medicine to their patients. I would never do anything that I thought would hurt you because I always will love you and respect you! I just want to have my mom back and not see her in pain. I think the greatest thing is how many different methods of administration the cannabis has that aren’t just rolling up a joint and smoking. By and large the most effective method of administration is the vaporization of the herb to release the cannabinoids in a mist of vapor. There is also ways to extract the active ingredients into oil that you can use for cooked goods that contain the medicine making the administration completely oral and non-respiratory. There are also oils that can be purchased that when place on the skin administer the dose of active ingredients. What I am trying to convey is that the image that you and I both have of drug enthusiasts is far from the case in the modern day cannabis market. I also believe that when it is decriminalized the market and the money is going to be there for people who are progressive and ready to capitalize on a long untapped market. The truth in this capitalization is rather evident in the fourteen states that promote the decriminalization of cannabis.

I want to also decisively interject that I have no desires to pursue or try any of the hard drugs like Crack Cocaine, PCP, Methamphetamines, or Heroin. Just like the drugs that you take these are processed and not natural at all. These drugs are manufactured to create and fuel a dependency. We know the effects of this dependency all too well. Not just Jensen, all of us do considering the class of narcotics mom is taking, the amphetamine salts that create the active ingredient ADHD drugs. Jensen is just a special case where she can’t set her boundaries in her decisions. She is the type of person who manipulates people and procures what she wants. Was it marijuana that made her that way? No, I honestly don’t think so. Between all the abuses she suffered she never got to truly grow up and she never learned that self-control that maturity can yield. Essentially, deception

I have also found some other research that I found. I could keep adding research and studies conducted by not only the US government but also reputable hospitals, I actually have more vigor to explore life and experience things that make me happy. In all honesty, Rachel can even attest, cannabis has made me better able to express my emotions and not immediately go to rage mode. I can also talk about and sort through the things that have been eating away at me for years. I honestly was never able to sort through all the emotions that Kenne put on me through. I put myself in a shell for so long that the shell is what became normal for me. Hell just as proof that it doesn’t make you lazy I would kind of like to show off something that I made by hand while using cannabis. PV4 Pocket Herbal Vaporizer is what I named it and I copied the style off of this Magic Flight Launch Box a commercially available pocket vaporizer. Like I said I love you so much and never want to let y’all down! Austin. Cannabis is a medicine that is not anything like the hard drugs that truly plague our society; it is a medicine that I think can truly help you.

Having ""Community meeting"" type threads on a given theme to give a sense of family would be nice. Example, bi-weekly, or what have you. I would be more than happy to take on the weekly thread topics, if needed. :) I also think that having a guest AMA every month would help, be it a dispensary owner or a NORML employee or something to that effect.

We bought a new pipe, grinder, and some screens to bring for them along with our pipes and vaporizer.  They tried both but they had difficulty with the lighters.

First of all, rather occasionally (3-4 times a week) and in big sessions. My body fat content is rather low, about 8-10% I think.

Here is the story: A close frient came over and we made us two muffins
Now here it comes: The next day, first warming up and then using heavier weights. 15 minutes later I noticed that something unusual was going on with me. It was a well known feeling. As I sat there heavily breathing and sweating, I started getting high! It was not a strong high, maybe [3], but nontheless I was stoned.
Can anyone of you eldertrees confirm this with own experiences?

Now in relation to the post I mentioned above
THC is a lipophilic substance. It tends to accumulate in your body fat (this is the same reason why they can find THC in your blood days after you smoked your last joint). Now when you start working out

We need some help. My wife's father and brother moved to California to legally grow. They acquired a license (215)
The brother was delivering in the father's vehicle, and got behind him and turned on his lights. Brother pulled over. The officer walked up to the passenger side, and opened the passenger door, without even first informing of why he pulled brother over. After the door was open brother asked why, and police said ""swerving"" (which he was not). Officer than asks how much marijuana was in the vehicle. Brother was picked up, and charged with 2 felonies, even though he was issued a (215) license from the state of California
Brother was taken to jail. He did not give consent to a search. It was also father's car, living in the trailer, had his trailer raided, and a separate amount of marijuana in the trailer along with personal property was confiscated, and told would not be returned.
So now even though these 2 were operating supposedly under California State law, and father has lost personal property.
So father is scared to call the police about his personal property
So California
Is this common to issue a license
Everything was lost in the ""raid"" and this is not a wealthy family by any means. So an expensive lawyer is not really an option.
Is this a racket by the cops? Is this how it works?

1349726847.0,115kfn,Making Cannabis Capsules,,71,6,20,"To do this you need:

* A small pyrex dish with a lid (tinfoil can be used to fashion a lid).
* A small pan (the dish should sit on the rim of the pan without touching the bottom)
* Empty gelatin capsules (I recommend OO size
* A pipette (I used a cheap plastic one bought from ebay in a pack of 5 for £1).
* Cheese/Muslin cloth.
* Extra virgin coconut oil (high content of healthy fats

1. Half fill your pan with water and put it on the stove.
1. When the water is boiling place the dish on the pan.
1. Put 10-20g of coconut oil and 5-10g of already been vaped weed into the pyrex dish. Alternatively put 3-10g of fresh weed in. If using fresh weed then decarboxylate it by putting it in the oven for 15 minutes at 100 degrees celcius and grind it to a fine powder when it comes out (more fine = more surface area = better extraction). **Make sure you use a probe to test your oven temperature against the dial
1. Put the lid on the dish.
1. Reduce the temperature on the stove so the water remains boiling but not so it is boiling so hard that your water will quickly evaporate away.
1. Walk away for 2 hours

After 2 hours then you're done with the boiling pan. Leave the pyrex dish to cool a bit then poor the mixture into cheese cloth. You want the mixture just cool enough that you can touch it without burning it as the warmer it is the easier it is to strain. Tie the cheese cloth into a ball around the weedy oil paste and squeeze it as hard as you can. You'll lose some weight in this process. You could just put the paste directly in but the plant matter gives some people gas or an upset stomach and the shelf life of the capsules will be reduced.

Now you can use the pipette to fill up your empty capsules! They start off a dark brown colour but turn green as they cool.

These capsules will last for several months at room temperature. I store them in the fridge. When making this recipe with 5g of weed that has already been vaped to a dull brown colour then 3 capsules gave me a real nice mellow stone.

I have just came back from an evening run and it was so amazing that it would be sad ""tears lost in the rain"" way not to share it.

The country i reside in is a small post soviet nation. There is no talk of legalization and no pro marijuana lobby that could change that. There is still a lot of stigma in my generation (30+ years old) to smoke trees unless you attended an art school and while younger generation is more open - i still feel anxiety/fear and have to hide a lot of my smoking. 

So today i waited till dusk, i felt the music giving me wings as i was running completely relaxed and breathing just the right way - not too heavy and not slow.

Felt like a F16 flying just above ground! My body - a bone and muscle machine which can outrun other animals - working in perfect harmony and some amazing technology blasting a perfect soundtrack trough the tiny earpieces.

What I want to let you guys know is that most, and are often times sold from the back of large distribution vans to whatever head shops will take them. 

You may know these bongs as [""acrylics""](http://i.imgur.com/CGo4O.jpg) or [""bongs with a rubber grommet""](http://imgur.com/a/OXwYN); and they are entirely a scam if you are looking into high end glass.

Any piece of high end functional glass should be measured by the artist behind the work; if your head shop does not know/will not tell you the artist behind your piece of glass then the onus falls on you to get the hell out of that store. 

**The basics;**

[This is a slide](http://cdn101.iofferphoto.com/img/item/139/764/475/D7iYegFY9HpHBlb.jpg). The slide holds your bud and is often refereed to as the ""bowl piece"". It comes in standard measurements of 14mm or 19mm for the ""joint"" wherein it will connect to your downstem/ashcatcher.

[This is a downstem](http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/14/downstem.jpg/sr=1). The downstem also measures either 14mm or 19mm

[Here is a tube](http://www.everypipe.com/images/sized/media/uploads/DSC03280-640x0.JPG). This is a straight tube set-up with a downstem and a slide

[Here](http://media.photobucket.com/image/medicali%20straight%20tube%20with%20ash%20catcher/hxcas1laydying/Pieces/photo.jpg) is another straight tube, you will need to make sure that the ash catcher fits into the downstem AND that the slide you have will fit into the top of the ash catcher. 

------
Now that you have come to understand the basics of what functional glass should be

What makes a glassblower unique in the contemporary day and age is the aspect of their glass blowing wherein smoke is passed through tiny ""diffuser holes"" so as to cool down and smooth out the hit.

**FAQ;**

*What is this oil thing I keep hearing about?*

Oil is cannabis concentrate which is extracted using Butane and has a consistency much like that of honey or molasses, a dome, and a special type of slide.

[Take this example of a Hitman SideCar](http://i.imgur.com/kTWxj.jpg) and you can see how the nail is placed into a special joint in the glass, the V3 from Highly Educated is considered top class for Ti nails.

*Are the only artists around the ones listed here*?

Hell no! There are local artists in every city and every state around the country. Some are better than others. Some do work on commission

*Why do you like glass so much?*

I smoke a lot.

*Changed some wording to be less pejorative towards production line glass.

**User Ate_A_Preach provides a very handy guide for buying good quality artistic glass from local artists [heady glass] which will stand the test of time and space. Note that these types of pieces are distinct from the ""scientific"" pieces described above. 

&gt;Find a shop that sells glass in your area, he'll check your ID and bring you around to a roped off part of the shop and you can see marks in the counter where he slams the glass to show how strong it is. I have a small Sherlock I purchased from him, my favorite thing about it is the mouth piece, you can see that it's not perfectly round and therefore not machine made. If you're going to drop more than $50 on glass, buy something with personality that was crafted as a piece of art. You will appreciate it far more than something that rolled off an assembly line in China.

1342277322.0,wjtla,A message from the DEA (former),J4CKR4BB1TSL1M,80,18,26,"I wanted to be a police officer my entire fucking life, and even if they were I could implement a system to defeat them I saw nothing holding me back from smoking weed in lieu of getting absolutly shit face drunk. A side note: getting shit face drunk in the DEA and beating people up is generally regarded as a good story

I travelled the world as a DEA agent and where ever I went I used my skills to enter the black market and smoke, from many sources and compiled them with a bit of analysis input and sent it up to higher. The interesting thing that distinguished me from my coworkers was always my ability to have a little extra information, as if I had always just one more source than everyone else but he was a source that was always turning up perfect information. In all sorts of countries that are related to drug smuggling in the US, I traveled and infiltrated the very people I was trying to stop. What the people I infiltrated talked about during our smoke sessions was usually life, religion, opression, racism, with me as a new member of their community, proclaim to not believe in God, and I was self determined

Before I had fully committed to my own program I wrestled with the morality of smoking weed while on the job. I asked, and I was concerned that I would be impaired while using it (turns out I'm not.) 

**Digression** A lot of people in the DEA have done tours with the army in Iraq and Afghanistan. I've done a tour in the mid stages of the Iraq war (after mission accomplished). I got in some small level gun fights but never anything overwhelming like in Generation Kill (not that extreme). However it was exciting, dammit). Anyway, I'm very fast at pistol shooting and my draw to bullet on paper at 10 meters if below 1 second. I can do that once in every 3 or 4 shots accurratley without just biffing the bullet somewhere into space. That is because to do that you gotta go at a, ""as fast as fucking possible"" speed and it's hard. So the point I'm making is that when I'm stoned and conditions are perfect for me ; I can get the subsecond draw more consistantly and with less distraction (fear of messing it up). Now I'm not saying smoke weed and get in gun fights, but I've been in some fucking high stress situations while stoned now (with the war background) and it's not really been beneficial on a thinking capacity but it always did enhance my ability to ACT and not freeze, always. Try smokin weed and playing paintball if you wanna experience that on a smaller level, but play half a day sober and half a day stoned you'll get what I mean. So fuck people who would ever tell me smokin weed would affect my job... Maybe if I was at a [10] sure, fucked up), if I drank while doing this I'd be dead I'm sure)

My initial trepidation with smoking marijuana on the job however did seem very valid without knowing where it would lead me. Marijuana doesn't enhance every thinking ability only some

What happend next was unexplainable to me but it gave me a new understanding of the dangers of marijuana. Not the personal dangers it poses to individuals but how it can frame the inner workings of your mind towards person betterment. It became very easy to see the connections in things especially after smoking a bit. My thoughts as communicate because very incoherent and hard to follow but if I recorded my self and sharpened my words into things I could share they were powerful thoughts. All of a sudden I have a daily creativity that was not representitive of the internal noise that used to be my life. 

With this creativity I was able to break down the walls of my mind

I don't fear the affects of marijuana. I can't smoke and do math better

Smoke weed and do anything really but it can be abused and confused. The real reason weed is illegal in my opinion is that because I am not the only person to realize how weed can be used and what it can help people accomplish. En mass there will be many people like me realizing they do not have to live a life of fear. Fear from the affects of a plant, fear, so much fear.

Marijuana grows out of the ground

Weed helps you not repress things

Nobody questions the morality of a cigarette and we all understand how many chemicals go into them. We think of cigarettes as a natural process of tobacco leaves and rolling them and then smoking however we fail to see the massive post production cycle that is involved to make them amongst other things more deadly (although that is not the design). It's funny then to see peopel questioning the morality of marijuana as described above and blaming marijuana for their problems (such as in /leaves). I see so many people with all substances attempt to solve the problem by quitting the substance

A lot of the time, house parties and loud bars were never (and still aren't) my thing because they were usually too loud for any sort of stimulating conversation. When it comes to that, I have trouble seeing if smoking weed is correlation or causation. I thought sometimes that I should have put more of my efforts in my free time towards something constructive rather than getting high. I would attempt every now and then to take ""tolerance"" breaks, but I would usually start up again in a few days (earlier than I set out to). Perhaps like others, if I had it, I couldn't not smoke it unless there was a dire reason not to (ie. drug tests). So that means I usually burned through stashes fairly quickly. I spent a lot of money on it, but it was money that I had earned.

This all sounds pretty negative, learned from, and talked with good people, and got immersed in music listening (a passion of mine). Like it or not, I have the perspective I have today because of my college experiences. I graduated about a year ago and except for a few times (like concerts), I've been completely clean. I have a good job that I enjoy that doesn't test. Although, it's rough trying to find anything in the burbs, working, and how you deal with self-control issues?

Now, that drive would be miserable. After playing a show, the adrenaline brings you up so much that there's not much that can bring you down... so it has become our tradition. So for the last 5 years I have been smoking and driving and I have actually avoided accidents, not gotten into them.

Seems to me we already have a lot of people driving stoned and from my personal experience, it has been helpful, not a hinderance.

So, and then having to give a statement to the cops about it, while stoned... that really doesn't bother me too much anymore.

My mom saw a text from one of my friends asking me to pick up for him. She confronted me about this and I promptly revealed that I have been smoking/vaping for the past year. At first this was met with a fairly level-headed discussion, and her thoughts about it. The conversation remained very civil as we are both reasonable people outside of this context. The following day, I have a similarly peaceful conversation with my dad.

All seems well and good; parents appeared fine with it and I now had a huge secret off my chest. A few days later

I don't keep many counter-arguments prepared for this kind of thing, and I have a vibrant social circle. I'm clearly not spiraling into self-decline, but all she can see is a burnout.

I've made a point of personal policy to be very open with my mom; we've discussed mature issues before (pregnancy, atheism, etc...) and I don't see how this should be treated any differently. More so than ever before, she seems hellbent on throwing away the relationship with her son that she spent 2 decades creating.

I love my mom and want to continue having her in my life. I'm asking for the guidance of the elders now because I desire advice from people who are my age AND her age in regards to resolving this dispute. I'm entirely willing to provide you all with any additional information about my scenario which was not sufficiently laid out here. Thank you for listening.

tldr: told my parents I used, help me sort out the aftermath.

Update: It feels like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders. I came to the talk prepared and was met with more curiosity than disapproval. They allowed me to make my case and I think we all walked away better for having spoken. My situation may not be the same as yours, you've all helped to make this very scary confrontation into a beautiful new reality where I no longer need to live with secrets behind closed doors. You being there gave me the courage to be honest with my parents and myself; I hope every one of you gets to know a happiness like this.

I thought my lungs were just sensitive to smoke, and would only vape and would always have Ricola and hot tea with honey on hand.  Then that stopped being enough and I started seeing an asthma specialist who has told me I'm most likely allergic to weed.  He gave me an inhaler to use in the morning and at night as well as the rescue inhaler as needed and told me I could try baking weed.

After that I didn't smoke for 8 or 9 days and convinced myself that I'm probably just allergic to the plant or the pollen so I tried extracting some THC into vegetable oil and making brownies.  I ate them with some friends this weekend and that caused the worst reaction yet...most likely because they were very strong brownies

Is there anything at all I can do?  This seems to be getting worse and I'd like to at least get to the bottom of what specifically is causing the allergy.  When I went to the allergist he had me bring in some weed and he made ethanol and saline solutions and tried to extract the proteins from them for 4-5 mins and then tested me with a scratch test, so that was inconclusive.

Is there anyway I can volunteer myself for a study?  Does anyone else who may be familiar with an allergy like this have any advice?  I still have some vegetable oil that I extracted thc into to make the brownies with
