SOME INFO FROM MY TEAM ABOUT MYSELF TO GET THINGS STARTED:
Bernard is best known from his  re-occuring role as ""CYRUS"" - the nemesis to Ricky

Bernard has appeared in many films besides the TPB in his past and is currently working on new projects as well. There is too much info to list on Bernard's filmography and his current stand-up comedy show/new projects in development in this post. Please visit www.safetyalwaysoff.com and browse around

This AMA is not about any certain thing -- questions can be about anything. Bernard has many things going on currently

This thread is open NOW to questions for tomorrow's AMA now here in the Reddit Trailer Park Boys Sub-Page! Tomorrow about this time a post on the iAMA page will go up as well that will point to this thread so all the questions appear in the same place.

Thank you so much for waiting xxxxxxx. So I will start off by apologizing for the information that was given to you was not accurate. We don't have a way of seeing if we renewed the license for a show. So as of now all we know is that it expires on the 1st of march. However I will be able to put the request in for you.

So I went on a booze cruise for a buddy's birthday Saturday, I was Lahey drunk. Still standing, but for all intensive purposes was not functioning on a human level. 

I went out for a smoke and started chatting it up with a cute girl. Things escalated quickly and we started making out outside the bar. She stops me and and asks ""How hot do you think I am?"" (I had just watched the last episode of the series the night before). For some reason Jim Lahey's response to Ricky asking him how dunk he was during the arrest spilled out. ""6 out of 10"" I responded. I almost piss myself I'm laughing so hard. When I finally open my eyes and wipe away the tears of laughter she was gone. 

I've never laughed so hard at a self cock block.  Cheers!",self,t5_2rbaa,False,,bubbles,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/trailerparkboys/comments/vkuk7/i_was_lahey_drunk_saturday_and_got_to_use_one_of/
