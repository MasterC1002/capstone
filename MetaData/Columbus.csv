A quick background: I moved to Columbus in the spring of 2011 following my graduation from a small liberal arts college in the Los Angeles Area to work at The Ohio State. I was born and raised in North County San Diego


I came to Columbus with an open mind and have loved almost every minute of being here. I consistently remind people who bitch and moan about Columbus that they are truly in an amazing town that is currently blooming and will continue to flourish in the near future. Here is my general guide and thoughts on Columbus. Understand that I am transportation challenged so most of this is in the Short North/Downtown area because it's where I live.


I'm going to start with what I am really quite passionate about: food and drink.


Food


Junior's Tacos - As a Southern Californian, but it can quench the crave at times. I like the al pastor tacos.


Mikey's Late Night Slice - no secret here. Everyone knows this place and for good reason as well. Awesome pizza with a twist of slut sauce. I would encourage you to try the weekly concoctions. My favorite is Spicy Ass with a small splattering of slut sauce.


Lac Viet - Pho. Just Pho. Pretty good pho too. He does a unique thing by making a lamb pho with beef broth and it's freaking delicious. Kind of out of my way, you'll get me next time."" Get the lamb pho if available but if not you can settle for beef.


Da Levee - Cajun creole food with Justin's twist. He makes cajun/creole cooking super accessible to people who have never had it


Bono Pizza - One of Columbus' most hidden secrets in my opinion. This is a wood-fired pizza place in Grandview that is connected to a Gas Station. Not joking. Go


Commonwealth - Ok, this place tops the list of good ""cheaper"" priced food in Columbus for me. Sandwiches done perfectly. Whenever I had someone visit me in town, this was the first meal we got, period. Go on Wednesday and get a $5 sandwich and you'll become a loyal member as well. Anything is good but my faves are The Lord Baltimore and the Bahn Fire.
I'm going to be revisiting Erik in some of the other places and I'll preface that I'm biased towards not only his food but to him as a person


Basil Thai - Ok, soup, and full size entree. For that deal it makes my list. Also, if you're a spice fiend, their ""spiciest you can make it"" isn't that spicy so go for it.


Bangkok Thai - now that I've given you mediocre Thai food


Katalina's Corner Cafe - Awesome breakfast and pretty damn good lunch. There is a meal here for anyone and I've never had a bad meal. It is very small indoors but has a huge patio - so if the weather is bad you might have to wait awhile and it might not even be possible to sit down and get food unless you're really craving or are extremely patient. If the weather is nice


Angry Baker - Really cool place in Old Towne East that I've only been to twice but had rad experiences both times. A really good feel but incredibly small. Don't go anytime that you would consider ""peak"" because it only seats probably 10-15. The baked goods are awesome (at the Angry Baker??? Go figure!). 


Explorer's Club - Once again


Tensuke Market - Just go. You've heard about it a ton of times and there's good reason to it. I like Tensuke (only been 3 times) and you're going to get exactly what you think are going to.


Tokyo GoGo - Food truck parked at Brother's Drake - GO. So very good. So very very good. Forgive my spelling, and Gyoza dumplings. The dumplings are my favorite but the karogge is so incredibly close. Fantastic Japanese street food and I absolutely love it. I only wish it was there for much longer before I left.


Skillet - German Village - Just a phenomenal breakfast spot. I haven't been there for anything but breakfast (do they even do other meals?), but to me it is well worth the wait. I constantly hear that they have the best Cinnamon roll in the world, but, alas, every time I go it is sold out. I guess that speaks to the quality of it.


Northstar - This place is insanely popular for a reason, but it will still be a square meal). 


Harvest Pizza - German Village - Damn good wood-fired pizza. More of a sit-down restaurant. Relatively small. Might be a little overpriced for dinner


Pistacia Vera - German Village - The macaroons are good


Jeni's Ice Cream - No Brainer. Just go. Best ice cream in America. Brown butter almond brittle will blow your mind.


I've been to a ton (read: 90%) of the fine dining in Columbus


Basi - Hidden in an Alley in Victorian Village - Real freaking good Italian food. Hand's down my favorite fine dining in Columbus. The zucchini pronto is one of my favorite dishes of all time (and it's so freaking easy, and is pricey.

Here’s how the H.B. 194 will hurt Ohioans by reducing their access to voting:
 
-Reduce by mail absentee voting to 3 weeks from 5 weeks and reduce in person absentee voting to 2 weeks.
-Ban in person absentee voting on Sundays and Saturday after noon hour
-Ban in person early voting during the last weekend before the election
-Make it more difficult for the Election Boards to open extra offices in the community to make it more convenient to vote early
-Stop local Election Boards from sending absentee ballot applications unsolicited to all voters
-Stop local Elections Boards from paying postage on return absentee ballot requests or on the return of absentee ballots
 
-H.B. 194 will increase the amount of people voting in person on Election Day

I think it would be really cool to have coffee with a whole bunch of people who think differently just so that I can get a greater understanding of people's outlook on life.**

After coffee

PM me if you're interested. Maybe you could learn something from me as well. 

**tl;dr:** I want to know what you're passionate about. I'll buy you coffee if you sit with me and talk about things no one else cares enough to listen to.



**EDIT:** I wanted to add an edit to clarify a few things:

1) As Jeff_E_Popp suggested

2) This is all about you. I know that some people have so much they want to say

3) I am getting a lot of people who are interested so I am making a spreadsheet so I will not forget about anyone. If you said you are interested

4) A little more about me: I'm an OSU Engineering Student and will be working in Columbus this summer in an internship. I'm just legitimately curious about different people's perspectives on life so that I can open my mind a little more to differences among all of us. 

Thank you for your interest! This will be an exciting project! 


**EDIT 2:** This is easily the best idea that I've ever had. I look forward to meeting all of you!


**EDIT 3:** I currently have about 35 people who have expressed interest. If it works out that I can meet with all of them, it means that it could be a while before I actually meet with you. Be patient because if you are legitimately interested in doing this, I will find the time to meet with you. It just might be 5-6 weeks from now... 

I should also note that I will only be here for 14 more weeks before moving to Findlay


**UPDATE: ** I just realized that there are a lot of people on here that said they were interested that I haven't set up a date with yet. If you still are interested or need some assurance

I am Adam from the [Oval Brewing Company](http://ovalbrewing.com). We are planning a new brewery in Columbus. It will be a production brewery with a tasting room attached (cans &amp; kegs). We are looking at a couple locations in the Short North / Brewery District. While it won't be a full brew pub from the start
Along with raising funds the traditional way

The campaign is going great so far

http://vimeo.com/37571657

[This page](http://ovalbrewing.com/kickstarter-reddit-rewards/) goes into more detail

One of the cool things about Kickstarter is it can track where backers originate from… and we thought it would be a great idea to keep track of and thank Reddit backers in a special way. If the total pledges originating from Reddit are $10, but you will get the opportunity to help crowd-source one of our first beers. You will get to vote on the label design, style, strength, and name! And regardless of your pledge level, your Reddit username will be displayed on the can*!

1313454803.0,jjxj7,I propose we make a wiki guide to Columbus.,hbweb500,47,0,20,"Yes
but I think we can do better!

Several years ago I spent a summer in the small college town of Davis, there are [tunnels built for toads](http://daviswiki.org/Toad_Tunnel) to use, and it has a bunch of [Hobbit-themed streets](http://daviswiki.org/The_Hobbit). This is all wonderful and made Davis a really fun place, but I never would have known these things if it weren't for the awesome [Davis Wiki](http://daviswiki.org/Front_Page).

Columbus is a great town, I realized we didn't have anything like the Davis wiki here. 

Here's the two main reasons I think a Columbus wiki would be great:

* Look at /r/Columbus and you'll see quite a few threads asking about local shops and culture: Who is a good mechanic in the city? Where can I go to find a one-night stand? A wiki would be awesome for these questions, and so forth.

* It would be a great place to highlight the charm of Columbus. One of my favorite things about Davis were all of the weird things around town, for example? They aren't exactly gems, but it's cool to read about things that you might pass every day but don't think about.


**But we already have the ""Reddit Guide to Columbus""**
Yes, however, the Reddit Guide is only really known by redditors, whereas a wiki might be able to help a wider audience.

**So why are you posting this?**
I'd love to build a Columbus wiki myself; I think it would be a great way to give back to the city and campus area. But I'm a grad student with limited time, I'm not hugely knowledgeable about Columbus. Of course anybody can write for a wiki, I guess I'm looking for some serious people who would be interested in running one.

**So, and hopefully useful to people, both redditors and the normal kind alike.

So here's the deal. I think aviation is too distant from people. Fences around the airports

**I want to bring my plane to your school yard.**

N566FD: Http://imgur.com/a/e3FHU

I have the trailer needed to being it to your school

I can adjust the lesson plan to fit as much or as little time as i am allotted

Example topics that can be covered:

- Explanation of aerodynamics
- Air traffic control operations
- Aviation safety
- Aviation engineering and maintenance
- Navigation and geography
- Airport operations
- Aviation career opportunities
- Flight training operations

Simply put

*Limitations:*

While the airplane will be on display and people can walk up, there are a few things that I cannot do for safety's sake, and to protect the aircraft from damage (as I am taking sole responsibility):

- As much fun as the thought is
- NO ONE will be allowed near the aircraft unsupervised. This is a live working aircraft with the potential to do serious harm. It will be shut down, and starter disconnected. We will be able to run the avionics though!
- It will be my crew's discretion where we take it and who may touch and climb in. I doubt we will refuse anyone, so I reserve this right.
- If allowed, at the end of the day as part of an aviation maintenance lesson.
- Cannot be done on fridays. We have to assemble and test the aircraft to return it to airworthyness

To arrange: PM or reply in comments. I'm incredibly busy so I often cannot immediately answer my phone, please don't waste my time, only call if you are serious about arranging something. :)

EDIT: here's a size comparison to the other airplane we have; same model same year.

Many of you are fans and supporters of Community Festival (ComFest), drink, art, music, and performances and the money raised through purchases is used throughout the year to fund grants to local community organizations.  At first glance it may seem like another hippie art festival, but deeper down ComFest provides a ton of support to the local community.  The past few years they have even taken action supporting workers' rights by organization action against SB5.  

Anyway

Speaking of Volunteering.... 

ComFest still needs more volunteers, and trash pickup jobs.  You can sign up here.  You'll get some drink tokens and a T-shirt for volunteering. 
http://www.comfest.com/volunteer/

Now here is my shameless plug:
My friends and I have hosted an annual electronic dance after-party on the Saturday of ComFest at Skully's Music Diner.  We've done this the past few years and it is always an amazing time. Skully's also has drink specials with your ComFest mug.  This year will be headlined by the local dark techno group roeVy and one of Columbus' most promising producers

Here's some background: As many of us know (at least a lot of the college student in the area) there was a block party on Chittenden Avenue Saturday. There were cops that were lining the streets before five o'clock while many people were plainly just having a good time within their property

The deal: a little before one o'clock, and if there was it was not audible and apparently they didn't find it important enough to make it heard. This is beyond unacceptable. Why are we allowing these police to fill the streets with police horses and what seems like the entire fleet of cruisers? What danger was posed this night? None is your answer. We did nothing and if there was someone breaking the law, arrest them! take care of the people that are actually committing crimes, not the bystanders. We do not live in a police state and this is not okay. Alright, so you say ""They were trying to prevent a riot."" I really disagree with this method of protection for a peaceful crowd but there's more to this story.

A large group of police officers were standing in the gateway area on 10th and high among the masses of people. I watched one of these officers walk towards a group of people just standing around. He pulled out his canister and sprayed them. What were they doing,,False,self,t5_2r373,False,,True

* [Our Kickstarter Campaign &amp; Video](http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1406680384/breakfast-with-strangers-50-meals-across-america)

If you are interested then please email us at breakfastwithstrangers@gmail.com and let us know in 500'ish words or less why you'd be the awesome breakfast interview as we travel across the USA for 5 months this summer. 

**The Details &amp; Route**

On July 18, ME and all places in between (and then back). Our van (1997 Ford Aerostar) will serve as our home and mobile recording station on wheels for the next several months. Our route is going to snake east across the northern section of the USA and then snake back to Oregon along the southern route. We're gonna try our best to move with the good weather. We plan on being in the Columbus area (and Ohio in general) in September but we'd love to find a few willing participants now. 

Throughout our journey, classifieds, flyers, word of mouth, Facebook, Twitter, Craigslist, CouchSurfing

**Why Have Breakfast with Strangers?:**

America is polarized. We feel that part of this civic problem is the lack of strangers connecting with strangers. We want to change this—or at least challenge it in our own small way—by taking strangers out to breakfast across America. We’ll share local diner fare and conversation, community, and commonality, culminating with a book: Breakfast with Strangers: 50 Meals Across America.

**The Conversation:**

This journey is a conversation. We’ll skip the small talk and ask the big questions

* www.breakfastwithstrangers.com
* www.facebook.com/BreakfastWithStrangers
* www.twitter.com/#!/BWS50Meals

**The Outcome:**

At the end of our trip we’ll select 50 breakfasts to highlight in our book

The most important outcome of all: the reminder that we are all part of a larger community.

The Flames (11-13-4) are currently 14th (out of 15) in the Western Conference. They are 4-6-0 in their last 10 games.

NORTH CAMPUS: As of this morning

**Edit 4:30 pm 6/30** Rio at Lane &amp; High is closed

Short North allegedly has power

**EDIT:** Also

OSU campus has power; the main library

McDonald's at High and 18th is open.

WEST SIDE: Friend is reporting that everything around Wilson Avenue, Target, and Meijer on Rome-Hilliard are all open. Kinnear Road at Kenny is reportedly still closed.

NORTHEAST SIDE: Repair crews are out on parts of Hamilton Road as of 3:15 PM.

OLD NORTH/SOHUD: Rumba Cafe on Summit is open w/ power.

INDEPENDENCE VILLAGE: Kroger's at Gender and Refugee reportedly has power.

CHURCHES: Vineyard Columbus is reportedly without power. If anyone has information on churches that are opening their doors with food

Columbus Crew game for tonight has not been canceled

POLARIS: Reports of traffic lights out

**UPDATES 7/1**: Rio at Lane &amp; High apparently reopened for a bit last night (6/30)

Traveling south on 315 from Lane to 71 South last night resulted in no problems for me

Polaris reportedly just got more power back (including at Mellow Mushroom) but it is unclear whether or not the whole mall has power back now or just most of it. Crew Stadium has power back (last night's game was delayed by an hour) so any future events should proceed as planned.

Charlie (the only name he responds to through about 4 hours of giving him a different name every-time i need his attention) will be leaving my care today, that is where he will be. Also if anyone wants a great, loving, house-trained, playful dog, PLEASE go adopt him. he needs a good owner more than ANYTHING. to P-Rickles, im sure the animal shelter could tell you if he has shots or not, so if you would like to call them, and showing basically anyone who visits r/columbus this dog. i will leave you with two final pictures of his last day in my care.

That being said I really like movies and don't have a ton of cash. So I'm going to attempt this. I even took the day off work (with personal time

My gameplan is to bring my iPhone loaded with movies and my 3DS (both with headphones of course) and try to sit in a back corner. This is going to amount to cruel and unusual punishment, so why not waste an entire day getting free movie tickets for a year?

Let me know if you are interested

**UPDATE**: Sleeping may or may not be allowed. May or may not be plugs. Parking is basically $1 per hour

Meetup Possibilities: Winking Lizard, Grandview Cafe, The Press Grill, Fabian's, Barrel 44, The Blue Danube, Brazenhead


Let's try and organize a meetup schedule a month at a time to allow people to clear up their schedule if need be -- starting with January.

More Possibilities: Hampton's on King, La Fogota, Mac's, Short North Tavern, Bier Stube, Watershed or MiddleWest distillery tour -- $10 dollars a person up front, but if we get enough people together we can get a group of our own.

I know that the main thing WBC wants is for people to challenge them and give them attention. But I think it could be wonderful if we get a group of people to not only outnumber their hate with kindness but also put that to good use.

I'm thinking the donations could go to something along the lines of the Human Rights campaign or Freedom to Marry.
People could make signs and post messages about it to try and get as many supporters of equal rights out there to donate and overpower the WBC.

I unfortunately will be out of the country in October

**edit** All we need is for a couple people to man a table with Donation signs and a collection box. I'm working on getting a permit to be able to collect donations from cars at the stop light where they will be protesting. If the permit is granted we'd need volunteers to work the intersection with donation buckets during red lights.

I am writing this on a throwaway account. Basically I want to run away. I want to get away from where I am and move to Columbus

Here is some background information about me that will explain why I want to get away. I am the youngest of three children, don't become like her and disappear in the middle of the night. That was all I heard from my mom. I guess my sister had enough of my mom saying that, so she moved from our home town to Dallas. She has been able to make it own her own and has a family. I idolize my sister for all that she has done for me, and for me to hear all this growing up I kept wondering what was wrong being like my sister. She is happy. 

I was told I have to get excellent grades so I can get into college. There was no other option for me. I have to get into college. This was my mom's plan. Get good grades, and then support her once I got a job. I'm sure some people would wonder what is wrong with that. It seems like a great plan. My mother is the problem with that plan. All her expectations and every god damn fucking thing out of her mouth, and among other things, have left with me with low self esteem and depression. She is the most racist person I know. She's one of those people who will pretend to like you with a smile on her face, and than turn around and talk back about you. She would fit right in with the Westboro Baptist Church. She is just like them just not openly like they are. 

I got good grades and then went to a community college since it was cheaper than going to a university first. After two years I transferred into a university my mom wanted to to go. It was the one she went to. At the university I started off well. Went to classes, nor would she let me drive. I just learned how to drive last year. Well I'm sure you know where this is heading. I flunked out of school. I just stopped going. I could not bring myself to go. I had no friends, and I hated what I was studying for my degree. Of course she doesn't know. No one in my family knows. They all think I graduated this May. I flunked out two years ago. I have been holed up in my room doing nothing with my life. 

I was able to pass off not walking down and receiving my diploma by saying I didn't want to do it. My mom was asking when my diploma would get here, to start a new life else where. I can't keep on lying, but I'm too far deep in my lies. All that thinking has made me realise I have done nothing with my life. I have virtually no friends anywhere near me, nothing holding me here at all. 

The reason I choose Columbus is because my only friend lives in Lancaster, but her daughters should come first. 

I guess with all this I want to know some answers and where I can look up more information. I've never had a job before

**EDIT**: So the consensus seems to be that people don't enjoy all that much or that it's not what it used to be. What would people like to see/change at comfest to better enjoy it?

**EDIT**:It's not about who ""should"" or ""should not"" be topless at Comfest. It's about everyone else not having a choice of whether or not they want to see that. 

There is no reason to run around topless other than to receive attention from gawkers. At least the naked bike ride is trying to promote something. 

It's supposed to be a community festival and a family friendly experience of which Comfest is no longer either of those. I'm by no means prude

Most go with the flow, there's a noticeable decline in driver quality on weekends compared to weekday rush hours when most people are working together so that we all get in to work.

Sure

• The Prius, etc. driver camped out in the far left lane going 5 under in lower traffic

• The oblivious driver entering a busy freeway at 35 or 40 mph

• The impatient speed demon who believes tailgating me will magically cause the ten cars in front of me to speed up.  So then he jumps over, my car is faster than yours, I've had race training so I can go much faster too, but this isn't the time or place.

• Overconfident drivers in 4-wheel drive vehicles going really fast (65-70ish) in heavy snow.  Psst: 4-wheel drive helps you go

Since then I have put together the beginnings of such a site and registered a domain name, http://columbus.wikispot.org will get you there. 

A community wiki would be nothing, here is a modest proposal: keep in the back of your mind that the wiki exists, and whenever you find a good place to walk your dog or a new place to eat, take a second and share your knowledge on the wiki. Nothing here is set in stone: feel free to add things to the front page and change around links.

Lastly, and so forth. These are things that can be found in tourist guides. What I'd suggest is that we document some of the weirder or more unique things about Columbus, too, even though they may not fit into one of the categories listed.

 Sarah here! You may remember me from such posts as ""Moving to Columbus soon-- tips?"" or ""Good printers in Columbus?"" or the weekly Thursday bar meetups. I'm here to bring you another sweet opportunity here in Columbus!

 So as many of you know, is not related to my work, this is just an organization I'm a part of and really like. It's the [Humanist Community of Central Ohio](http://hcco.org/), and it's a pretty ballin' organization. If you're not sure what humanism is, you should read [this](http://hcco.org/humanism) (because you might be a humanist already)!

So anyway! The point of this post is to invite you to the annual Winter Solstice banquet. They're going to be hosting [Jamila Bey](http://hcco.org/node/133) as a speaker

The purpose of the [Winter Solstice Banquet](https://secularstudents.wufoo.com/forms/hcco-winter-solstice-banquet-registration-2011/) is to provide members and non-members of the humanist community with a secular alternative for the holiday season. For the last several years, contact Julia at coordinator@hcco.org.

If you'd like to register, and I'll be there, along with lots of other cool people. :)",,False,self,t5_2r373,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Columbus/comments/mlqrc/are_you_a_humanistatheistagnostic_in_columbus/
