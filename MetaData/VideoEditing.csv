I plan on including lessons for intermediate level editors as well in the future. We will begin with the basics of Editing and move on to specific tools later. While there may be plenty of Editing Suites available

We will be using this subreddit along with the YouTube channel (http://www.youtube.com/InteractiveTutorials) for the lessons. Since, while I understand that you might be curious about future lessons, please hold off questions that are not related to the lesson at hand.

There are many channels on a website like YouTube. Some people use their skills for purely recreational and entertainment purposes. They make anime or music videos or fan edits/movie trailers. Some are more interested in Politics, reach a large audience. Some take part in social causes by volunteering to make informative videos for charity organizations. YouTube recently organized a video contest to encourage people to take part and help out these organizations in raising awareness for a particular issue. There are also those who share their knowledge and educate others on subjects like Science, Technology, environment, Religion/Atheism, cuisine, etc. And, it is important to realize the commonality in all of them. Regular people have been successful in contributing and sharing their ideas with the rest of the world with relative ease. This would not have been possible a few years ago.

So, it is not just the special effects and music but the quality and content of your thoughts that makes up a great video - the underlying theme. Therefore, you do NOT necessarily need to be an After Effects Whiz to make your point. The objective of this course is to equip you with the ability to translate your thoughts into videos. Later, you can learn more about improvisation and special effects.

**Video Editing Suites**

- [Sony Imagination Studio 4](http://www.sonycreativesoftware.com/imaginationstudio): Price $175 - This suite contains a video Editor, and DVD authoring software. There are also color grading and VFX plugins inlcuded. This is a sort of ultra-consumer package, not really for professionals or serious hobbyist, but for others who just want the ability to do more than the average editing software can do.

- [CS6 Production Premium](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativesuite/production.html): Price $1

- [Adobe Creative Cloud](http://www.adobe.com/products/creativecloud.html): Pricing $49 a month for one year,200, or the equivalent of 2 years of Creative cloud (which is also there upgrade schedule).

1348596721.0,10gmrx,How to Become an Editing Ninja by Making Your Own Movie Trailer,JMalky,57,9,18,"Hello r/videoediting

I see a lot of people asking 'how do I become a better editor?' or 'where do I start learning'? Well

If you put in some time and effort

* Get practice with your editing program of choice
* Learn how to edit to music
* Learn how to make cool titles
* Learn about pace and tone

And most importantly

You'll also get to play with amazing footage shot for millions of Hollywood dollars. Better than your buddy's skateboarding video

I'll be using three example trailers in this tutorial:

[Flight](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJ53JCLG9I0). It's an excellent trailer

[The Social Network](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lB95KLmpLR4). Which I think is the best trailer ever made. 

[The Andromeda Strain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YMbSpnlOOtE). This is a trailer I edited


**Step 1: Pick a Movie**

Choose any movie you like, un-scored footage, but you'll have to make do with the final mix. Although you can sometimes get away with it, you don't want the movie's score interfering with the music you're editing to. I chose to edit a trailer for The Andromeda Strain because it has no musical score at all, which meant I could pick any line of dialogue in the movie and use it in my trailer.

A final thing you may want to consider is that modern



**Step 2: Pick some Music**

I cannot emphasise just how important your music choice is. It'll tell your audience what kind of movie they're watching, picking good music is very tough. It's a real art form and I can't possibly explain it in this little tutorial. But what you're looking for music that's emotive and exciting. Don't just pick music you like. Trailer music isn't normal music. It's music with balls. Gargantuan balls. It needs to build and crescendo, it needs to be exciting and catchy, it needs to make your audience go 'cool!' or 'wow!' or 'omg I'm crying!'

Your safest bet is to use music from an existing movie soundtrack (I used music from Sunshine (2007) in my Andromeda Strain trailer). You're guaranteed that it'll have that 'movie music' feel.

Picking a regular track can be trickier, cool moments too. How about that bit with John Goodman at 0:59? Awesome.

For me, count 'em) ways. Firstly it's Radiohead's creep, a classic college rock song for a movie set at a University. Secondly, it's a choral cover, which feels very Ivy League and upper class (for a movie about wanting to be 'the elite'). Thirdly, the lyrics match the action of the trailer and the theme of the movie to an absolutely eerie degree. Finally, the song just perfectly grows and soars and becomes absolutely epic. It's perfect trailer music that perfectly matches the film.


**Step 3: Edit**

Ok, you'll be there all year), but more importantly you're looking for an angle on the story. This is why it's useful to pick a movie that you love. How would you explain the story to someone who'd never seen it before? How would you get them to be as excited about it as you are? Could you explain what the movie was about in a sentence?

When you've thought about that

Trailers have three parts: a beginning, 'story' and 'KABOOM'. Here's roughly how they work.

**Beginning or 'mystery':**

* Flight: 0.00 to 0.59
* The Social Network: 0.00 to 0.54
* The Andromeda Strain: 0.00 to 0.45

Remember the guy who'd never seen the movie? This part is you saying 'did you hear the one about…?' What you want to do in this opening section is intrigue your viewer. Tantalise them. The Flight trailer shows us a regular day on an airline jet and then - BOOM - Denzel wakes up in a hospital bed. Straight away we're thinking 'what's happened'? It's a crash, we know there's a secret underground lab for dealing with stuff from space. But what's inside? What's happened? People are getting sick and there's suggestions of contamination and sinister motives. The Social Network trailer takes a different approach. It shows us Facebook, and by juxtaposing regular Facebook images with the lyrics of the song, it gets us thinking 'why do we use Facebook', and reminds us that it's now an everyday part of life. When this movie was put into production, everyone said 'a Facebook movie? Are you kidding me?' but this trailer gets you interested, lets you know that the movie is going to be smart.

**Middle or 'story'.**

* Flight: 0.59 to 1.51
* The Social Network: 0.54 to 1.49
* The Andromeda Strain: 0.45 to 1.20

So the-guy-who's-never-seen-the-movie-before says 'no, what happened was…'. Get into the meat of the plot without giving too much away. Outline some characters, give us a sense of when/where the film is set. But most importantly, you have to tell us where the *drama* is. In Flight, although we still don't know exactly what happened with the crash, we learn that Denzel's character is both hero and villain. He saved the lives of everyone on the plane, but was he flying drunk? Did he cause the crash in the first place? In The Andromeda Strain, and that people are working to contain it. But is that possible? Can an Alien virus be contained? In The Social Network

**End or 'KABOOM'**

* Flight: 1.51 to 2.32
* The Social Network: 1.49 to 2.31
* The Andromeda Strain: 1.20 to 2.00

The-guy-who's-never-seen-the-movie-before says 'oh my holy god that sounds amazing!' He's astounded, the final section starts with Eduardo Saverin slamming Zuckerberg's laptop into the desk as the soundtrack reaches a crescendo. We get a series of crazy images of hedonism and people going out of control, of broken hearts and crashing empires. We have an old man's voice (a voice of authority) saying 'your best friend is suing you for 600 million dollars'. Holy shit this movie sounds amazing!

In The Andromeda Strain, losing hope, smashing things in a rage. We've got someone saying 'you knew it, stone! You knew it!' Knew what?! And under it all, the virus continues to mutate.

Flight is similar, then it kinda rolls back into 'story', then there's another break into 'KABOOM' at 2.11. So once again - this *mystery-story-KABOOM* formula is just a rough guide. Don't feel you have to stick to it slavishly.

**And Finally...**

One more thing before the end of the tutorial: Let's think about the opening image and the closing image. I don't mean the specific shots you open and close with

Unless you're a massive Denzel Washington fan, what's going on here…?' The Andromeda Strain opens with 'don't be scared, I'm a doctor', then BAM, we've got a sinister, lone man in some crazy sci-fi lab. It's a simple conflict between what someone says and what we see/feel. The Social Network trailer opens with Facebook, and to be honest I think that's enough because we're thinking 'oh, I've read about this one'.

What about final images? The Social Network closes with a great little exchange between the chairman of a board and Zuckerberg. He says something that doesn't quite make sense and she says she doesn't understand. He replies with 'which part?' Basically: this guy doesn't make sense, and closed with 'I'm scared, oh lord I'm scared'. So I'm hammering fear down yer throats. And Flight… oh baby. It closes with an image that just completes the whole trailer. We've been hearing for almost three minutes about 'miracles' and 'I don't believe it' and 'nobody else could've done it' and then - boom - *a plane flying upside down. Holy shit.* BRB, buying a movie ticket.


So… that's that. TL;DR version = edit a movie trailer

**Breakdown of project level**

* Beginner: Single video stream (one layer of video), export to youtube or DVD. 1-15 minute long videos. This could be a home video for grandma, skate/sport video, birthday party, gaming montage, etc.

* Enthusiast/hobbyist: 1-3 streams of video, graphic overlays, basic 2d animation. 1-15 minute videos. This could be a small documentary, basic commercial, budget youtube series, etc.

* Entry Level Professional freelancer: 1-5 streams of video, basic visual effects, titles, overlays, and more. 1 minute to 1 hour long videos, such as commercials, documentaries, etc.

This is where I will stop because most people beyond entry level professional freelancer have the working knowledge of what they need. The extent of my experience is a Dual Xeon Mac Pro with 32gb of ram and a few raids for the disc setup. 

**It is strongly suggested you build this system yourself

**Beginner**

* CPU: Current generation i5 or AMD FX/Phenom processor. Intel costs more

* RAM: 8gb

* HDD: 7200rpm

* GPU: GT 640 or higher for Premiere Pro

* Price: $800+

*[Sample Beginner Build](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/Ipxc)

**Enthusiast/hobbyist**

* CPU: intel Xeon (1230 or 1240 as of this date)

*Thanks to Proxi_Pixel for letting me know how well his 8350 rig performs!*

* RAM: 16gb

* HDD: 3 Disk setup, and one 7200RPM HDD 
for cache/render/previews.

* GPU: GTX 660/560 or higher for Premiere pro

* Price: $1

*[Sample Enthusiast/Hobbyist build](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/IpBz)

**Entry Level Professional**

* CPU: Intel 3930K

* RAM: 32gb 

* HDD: This can go many ways

* GPU: GTX 680 4gb for premiere pro, but much cheaper. You may also need a dedicated monitoring card if you're doing high end broadcast work.

* Price: $2

*[Sample Entry Level professional Build with some disks for a few RAID 0's](http://pcpartpicker.com/p/IpGw)


**In all cases it is wise to have a daily backup. an external HDD or external RAID just for backup is best.**

Now some of you might want laptops

**Beginner Laptop**

* CPU: Current gen i5

* Ram: Upgrade to 8gb

* HDD: upgrade to 500gb 7200rpm HDD plus an external 1TB drive for projects you're not working on.

* GPU: Nvidia if you're on adobe

**Enthusiast/hobbyist Laptop**

* CPU: Current gen i7

* Ram : 16gb of ram

* HDD: Internal 256gb/512gb SSD

* GPU: Nvidia GTX 640M or higher

**Entry Level professional**

* At this point we're talking about a $2

**Monitors**

This is where things can get tricky. I suggest only IPS monitors

*1920x1080 resolution recommended* 

**Beginner**

* Dell or LG IPS

**Enthusiast/hobbyist**

* Dell IPS

* Apple Cinema Display

**Entry Level Professional**

* This is where things get pricey

In the bottom left and right of PPRo, but it kills productivity like you can't believe. We get in the office at 7:30 and can battle for three hours just trying to get stuff working.

We have a major deadline to get out 30 more cuts by next Friday and simply can't afford to lose this time.

We've tried clearing out all the PPro Preview files (there was about 30GB worth.) which didn't help.

We've tried opening different projects on different iMacs (ranging from mid-2010 to mid-2011 models) but there's still no way of knowing exactly what the issue is and thus not being able to find a solution.

I can downscale it to 30FPS while recording, but it might be causing the movement blur seen in the video. (Note, I am watching it in 360p. It is fine in 720.

It's crazy long overdue that I start learning how to film considering I bought a camera like 1.5 years ago. :/

So i've been video editing for almost 10 years now as a hobby and am looking to see if I can earn some extra cash flow in by freelancing my skills out. I'm confident in my work and if this takes off

Now every time ""making money"" is involved

ALSO feel free to ask ME any questions that will help clarify anything for you guys!

-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

1. **What do I need to take care of legally before I can charge people for my work? Do I need to create a trademark or patent a company name or brand for the videos I make?** 
I basically wanna avoid getting sued or doing anything illegal.

2. **What are some average rates that I could charge people for my work? Hourly? Length of video?** 
I know it always varies but a good foundation is what I'm looking for.

3. I've been using **Sony Vegas Pro** since **Vegas 4** and am extremely fluent with the program. **If I were to take this freelancing more seriously
Vegas crashes more frequently as more and more FX are added so that's why I'm asking.

4. For people who already freelance. **How's it going for you?** Care to share any helpful tip on ***what to do*** and ***what NOT to do***?
I'd really appreciate it.

The ISO on one of the DSLRs was 3200+ for most of the event. The lighting there was terrible ... I knew there were a few denoising plugins out there so I made the call to film at a higher ISO. I ended up settling on Neat Video's Reduce Noise plugin for Premiere Pro CS6. It is unbelievable how much better this looks! I never want to plan on cranking the ISO up so high but if I must ... I at least know I don't have to worry about it being unusable.  

The only downside I can think of is this 7 hour render time! °o°  

I am using a AMD Phenom II X6 1090T and thats comparable to an Intel Core i5 2500. Neat video allows for you to also allocate all your graphics cards to help but one of my cards actually slows it down so I am using CPU+1GPU mode.﻿

I've been working on a Final Cut Pro X project that is about 16 minutes long for the NJ Firefighters Valor Awards dinner that is on Saturday night. This is a huge event. I do this on a volunteer basis and we've put a ton of time into this video. Of course tonight we go to run the DVDs off after putting in about 40 hours into this thing and the project is corrupt. Here's the story:

While working in Final Cut Pro X 10.0.0 my computer crashed and upon attempting to reopen the project was missing. When manually dragging in the project file it tells me the file is corrupt. Must've been saving or something when it crashed.

I have no backups as it appears 10.0.0 does not do this as there was no ""Backups"" folder in the project folder. 

Interventions so far:

-I deleted the 2 Final Cut Pref files.

-I duplicated the project file and attempted loading.

-I attempted to open from a different hard drive.

-I upgraded to Final Cut 10.0.6 which gives me the following message which either deletes it if I click continue or sends me back to my finder.

http://i.imgur.com/QjDpuID.png


I have the original files/folders saved (after the error occurred) so as to not lose anything while troubleshooting. I searched my hard drive for .fcpproject and could only find the ones in the project folders - no backups.

The events and clips are loading - but not the timeline/project which is where all the work is.

How might this effect have been created? I have a feeling that there really was fire burning on his hands, and the way the fire sways as he moves his hands is extremely realistic-looking. However, if he really did have fire in his hands, how did he not burn himself? Maybe there's some thin, almost invisible fire-retardant material that I just don't know about?

That makes me think that there really was never any fire. But I can't imagine how much time it would take to create such a realistic and believable sway

I have a 2 minute Premiere project which has a lot of different videos in the sequence. I have to do color correction and other adjustments to most of the clips, replace with AE composition, do my job in AE, save AE project as Comp1.aep. For video2, I would go to Project1.prproj, save it as Project2.prproj, do the replace thing, save as Comp2.aep. So on and so forth, video6 have been replaced by Comp10

So I try every way I can think of to re-link these files, it goes back to Project1.prproj. I manage to salvage some videos from the AE auto-saved projects, and import them into a fresh sequence in a fresh Premiere project, but most of them still show up as Comp10! 

I tried re-importing the sequence from Project10 into a brand new Premiere project, and Premiere just freezes. It seems like anything I try now, Premiere just dies and is  not responding.

I finally gave up and went into After Effects (having previously tried to export each Comp as a Premiere Project, tried importing either the .mov or .hd, it freezes and is not responding.

I'm a final cut editor at a tv station.  I've recently been tasked with maintaining our archives.  From 1980ish-1990ih is on 3/4"" umatics and from 1990ish - 2000 is on MII.  

My challenge is to digitize everything that is salvageable.  And that means finding a format that will work best and stay small in size.

I have the option of saving digitized files to DVD or Blu-ray Discs.  I might be able to leverage the budget gods to provide a NAS later on.

My initial thought was simple DVD-NTSC and maintain the 4x3.  But a quick 60second dump of tape comes up at 228mb.  I'll never get a 90min MII on a single DVD at that rate.

It all started with [This ""Slothcano"" font style](https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-1vPEUbjtaoQ/UenoA44mmWI/AAAAAAABxjE/cH3GGfxcVdM/w500/c2maZJO.jpg) created by /u/BigMP.

I really thought it just popped out so I messaged him and asked if I could use it for an intro and he was perfectly fine with it and told me the basics on how to make it.

I had an idea of what I wanted it to look like. It took a good amount of looking for the perfect sounds and effects but it finally came together nicely (IMO).

I'll explain my simple process. (I know it could be better but be nice lol. My girl was getting bored while I was throwing this together.) It was made entirely using only Photoshop and Sony Vegas.

1. I started with a good [background image](http://imgur.com/a/JdesE#0) from a post I saved a while back.
2. Made a similar font and effect in photoshop. Split it up into 2 images because it's 2 words. Added blue background for blue screening.
3. Decided about 6 seconds is a good length for this intro
4. Decided I wanted the theme to make it feel as if you were at a ""scrapyard""
5. Found a standard [steel pattern](http://aluminumstock.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/aluminum-diamond-plate.jpg) and overlaid it on top of the BG image at about a 2% opacity.
6. Used an continuous
7. Used smoke effects to the left and right of the video via [Video Copilot](http://www.videocopilot.net) as well at around a 5% opacity.
8. Used [NewBlue](http://newbluefx.com) transitions in Vegas for when the text goes in and out.
9. Faded in the beginning and faded out the end
10. Rendered it in 1080p and put it back into the timeline
11. Then I added added sound effects (these were hard to find and i had to edit them to make them sound like I wanted)
 - Constant background noise of machinery drilling
 - Hammer hitting and anvil for when the text ""hits"" the screen (found and edited the sounds from a Lord Of The Rings: Making of the weapons YouTube Video)
 - The sound the drill makes when it takes bolts off a tire (found and edited the sound from a nascar YouTube video)
 - Added a crackling fireplace sound effect to go along with the ""blacksmith"" theme.
12. Next I took the video and used keyframes and cropping to twist and zoom so the smoke, potentially lowering the quality)
13. Added slight ""Film"" FX to make it look like it came off a film roll.
14. Manually darkened corners with a filter and blurred them in to make it less noticeable in a newly created top layer to the timeline

15. Re-rendered and [THIS IS THE FINAL OUTCOME](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wVVqNYVUPXY). Check it out in 1080p.

So. I have about 500 GB of about 120 events. Each individual event is ~3-4 GB, and when I play the unedited version the event plays in full screen. Some of my events were cut into multiple files, and this doesn't work with my job's website, so I have to merge and compress each event into 800-1200 MB .mp4's.

I figured this process out myself using Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 and Adobe Media Encoder CS6

What format should I choose? Most likely it would be a custom format, but it creates a black frame around the top and bottom of the video. I have dabbled with Android Tablet 720p 29.97 as the size is a little smaller and the frame is full, but the time taken to complete the compression is significantly greater. Quality isn't the biggest concern here, though it obviously factors into the importance. Video needs to be visible, but not HD. If someone could with greater video editing knowledge could shed some light, I would be very grateful. Ideally walking me through a custom setup, if not just let me know the best preset for my situation. Thanks!

1366205793.0,1cj4j3,VideoPad Video Editor - a basic user question,renational,7,1,2,"my edit needs are simple; take about a dozen minute spans of footage from an hour long video off a wide range of file formats and screensizes (lightworks is terrible at this - it's too picky).  VideoPad does what I need but has one tragic flaw which triples the amount of time it takes me to get any work done (besides only using one core - it's free so i can't complain).

the three basic buttons for setting a start point end point then copying and pasting that selected footage from to your storyboard works as follows;

#Ctrl + . : Set input point here
#Ctrl + 
#Ctrl + e : Add clip to sequence

so I should be able in the Selected File Preview window to set the input output then add the clip to the end of my storyboard sequence, so there is no need to mouse around to position it and set a new storyboard endpoint.*

only in VideoPad it does not allow me to work this way.

what VideoPad does is after I add a clip it greys out the Add clip command and button, then i have to hunt through an hour of video to find the area of the file i left off and only then can i designate a new input output point so the Add button is active again.

i imagine there must be a way to clear/reset the input:output points so the Add clip button refreshes and comes back ready for your next clip selection - but the only way to clear/reset those input:output points that I can find is to reload the original video file all over again into the preview window.

this is truly frustrating.  why would anyone design a program that makes you start all over again to simply get to your next area for clip selection.  I can only assume there is some setting or usage finesse I may not be familiar with, so I'm hoping someone here can help me out.

Imagine you were word processing a 100 page contract and every time you cut&amp;pasted a paragraph to a new area, yet that's exactly how VideoPad seems to work.",,False,,t5_2ri0h,1366209537.0,,

In the past, so I've only got it on my desktop. This  limits my editing abilities, since I have to be tied down to edit. Also, I'm kind of ashamed to say that I don't own Premiere Pro, and I would like to actually buy some video editing software. 

I'm pretty well bought into Adobe as a brand. I'm a user of Lightroom and Photoshop. I've used Premiere before. I'd like to stay in that universe. 

**SO HERE IS MY QUESTION

Should I fork over the money for Premiere CS6 or whatever the newest version is

* Basic editing of 1080p 30fps frames from my Canon 5Dmk2

* Audio syncing. I like to record external audio on my Zoom H1. I don't care if I have to sync it manually

* Basic color correcting. I'm used to manually setting White Balance and watching it, I just want things to line up and be pretty unified in a journalistic way. 

* With my experience with photo editing

* Fine control over where effects like visual/audio fades start and end

I know the premiere I had can do all of this

Here's the setup I'm running: Dell XPS 13"" 128GB solid State hard drive (I don't store any files on the computer. It's purely editing) Windows 8 64 bit, I'm very wary of how much space things take up, though, so I would like the lighter/cheaper elements if possible. 

[Here's a video I did on Premiere. It uses just about all of the features I would need in a video editing software package.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HIqlCD10e8I)

I had a lot of mixed thoughts while putting together shots and had a bazillion transitions with a ton of short shots but that ended up seeming odd and tacky and I preferred the slightly faster pace that hard cuts seemed to add while including longer dedicated shots  -because it felt like each shot had more context and reason to be there the longer it was on screen.- It was also as if the dissolves and fades slowed the whole thing down and the cuts made it faster...
  
But, ""well that seemed pretty cool"". I am not one for big productions and ""Oh my god!"" sort of things....  
  
So, too long? What can I work on in terms of transitions and compiling different shots together? What sorts of things should I include/not include in a video like this? What sorts of editing am I missing in this video that I should consider so as to improve it?
  
I have about 8-9 hours of video from the trip, but I just don't know how to fit shots together. I ordered the book [In The Blink Of An Eye](http://www.amazon.com/Blink-Eye-Revised-2nd-Edition/dp/1879505622), and I am dedicating my evenings to learning film making and editing. I have Sony Vegas as my program, and the camcorder I am using is a [Canon Vixia HF G10](http://usa.canon.com/cusa/consumer/products/camcorders/consumer_camcorders/vixia_hf_g10).

I do our guild kill videos in World of Warcraft and this is my first video using Vegas. I primarily used Windows Movie Maker beforehand but the new UI isn't very good and frankly I want to learn something a little more challenging that will hopefully have a better payout!

Anyway [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOHCW64wsL0) is the video in question that I think can have a higher quality. When I preview the video it looks better than what I render and I want to know if it's possible to get that kind of quality from my FRAPs videos.

I'm not sure if part of the problem is that FRAPs creates videos in .AVI. Originally the videos were too dark after Vegas rendered them and I had to apply a level that changes the Computer RBG to Studio RBG. Otherwise the video is unedited except for a little cropping and very minor transitions. Thanks for any help you can give!

I'm new to the world of editing but I'm trying to refine my skill so I just installed Avid on my home computer and wanted to work on a school project at home. All of my footage and SFX are saved on the same external HD. After setting up my home computer with the same settings as those I was using at school (I think anyways...)

As I said, I did something that might make it difficult to re-link the footage. I'm going to try my best to describe how I organized things here:

I originally shot ~ 4, I created individual bins for each scene. Then I clicked and dragged these shots out of their original bins and into their proper ""scene bin"" so that I could quickly find each scene. This means that each of these scene bins contains a random assortment of of shots from each of the four original bins as they are actually saved on the external HD. Is there an easy way to still link all this media to the proper place?

Personally, AVID does have it's place for sure, but I have only worked on a small number of projects, so my mind may change. At this stage I'm looking to have a handle on all of the editing programs.

Having just cut my entire first project in Avid MC and then going to FCPX I am stuck wishing I used FCPX. I just took Apple's three day FCPX course to learn all the basics about the programs and to keep it simple, sliding, rolling and general editing seems to be a lot easier. Now, as I am a beginner editor I haven't started to venture into multicam edits, using after effects/motion or many different formats of footage.

I've watched the Videocopilot tutorials and practiced all the effects… I feel I have a good preliminary grasp on basic keyframes/masking/tracking/3D etc, and how *others* work…

Do you bring one video section in, then put that back into the larger project? Or something else entirely?!

I'm using Vegas Movie Studio for my editor (PC). I want to do a few more things that my editor doesn't do well… masking/tracking in particular.

Eg: within a larger project

I'm thinkng I'll:

* Edit in Vegas as usual.
* Work out what clip needs the smoke.
* Take that clip and open it with AE.
* Track Motion on the city
* Add a smoke video (from Action Essentials 2) to the composition.
* Parent the smoke to the null object. (scale
* Render.
* Take the render result and put it back into the larger project in Vegas.

Does this sound about right?

It seems somewhat complicated

I'm also worried it will lose quality in there somewhere?

That's my main question! Here's some minor ones I jotted down while doing tutorials and googling…

* Audio?! All the AE tutorials ignored audio
* Do people commonly work with multiple composition tabs? I've only really worked with one so far
* The [tuts recommended Rendering to quicktime](http://www.videocopilot.net/blog/2007/06/which-render-settings/)? I don't know much about formats, I'm on a PC, working with Vegas, source-files mainly a mix of MP4 and AVCHD (sometimes a few Quicktime FX), and my end product is for YouTube.

For the past couple years I've been trying to research how to put together a decent video editing machine to make some home movies of scuba diving/surfing/my bands/adventures/etc. using good but relatively basic cameras that are surely sold by the thousands every day at Best Buy around the globe.  I'm afraid to pull the trigger and invest on a home build that seems legit if it may not really hack it when I dig into anything remotely complex.

The following is a draft PC build.  Will this (or something similar) make me a happy as a beginner in video editing?  How far could this build take someone?  Are there any tweaks that would improve this while keeping the cost in this general ballpark?

* **OS:** Due to the nature of my career/industry

* **CPU:** [AMD Phenom II x6 1090t](http://www.google.com/products/catalog?q=phenom+ii+x6+1090t&amp;hl=en&amp;prmd=imvnsr&amp;bav=on.2, 6 cores, socket AM3

* **Mobo:** Something that lends itself useful for potential upgrades - i.e. I've read that a socket AM3+ is backwards compatible with the AM3 processor above

* **Memory:** Starting with 8 gigs

* **Storage:** 2 Western Digital 7200 rpm hard drives running together as Raid 0

* **Video card:** [EVGA GTX 550 Ti](http://www.tigerdirect.com/applications/SearchTools/item-details.asp?EdpNo=41125&amp;Sku=E145-0550)

* **Monitor:** Will any old VGA monitor work for now (more future birthday/hanukkah upgrades to myself) or is this another serious consideration that will need to be planned for immediately?

* **NLE:** I'm up for anything.  I've heard that Sony Vegas relies more on a processor

I find that one of the most annoying aspects of YouTube is the very beginning and end of sports/action/how to videos when someone is fiddling with the camera to turn it on and off.  This tells me that the video quality is easily attainable

And I'm just trying to find the optimal work flow to be able to handle the footage at normal speed and to be able to slow it down

So here's sort of what I've been doing thus far...
1) Run the original clip through Compressor -&gt; keep the frame rate

2) Using this clip immediately in FCP seems to not produce true slow motion...despite what I set my sequence at or actually changing the speed of the clip. So from here I've been....

3) Running the new clip through Cinema Tools to conform it to 24p. This has no overwritten my old clip...so now I....

4) Start a new Sequence....drop the clip in and select YES when it asks if I want to set my sequence settings to the clip. This now produces actual slow motion utilizing all of the 60 frames. So we're cool...sort of.

Right now it seems like I have to stick with a 24fps timeline

     I have been having an issue with a specific feature of Final Cut Pro X's multicam feature and am looking for help/advice. I did a 2 camera shoot that took place over 4 hours and had several long takes approximately 15. What I am attempting to do is to create 1 multicam clip that includes all of my takes. so essentially I am trying to get a 4 hour long multicam clip. I have all of my footage (15 takes) with each camera imported in an event. I set the meta data on all the clips as such (take 1 angle 1 camera 1) (take 2 angle 1 camera 1) (take 3 angle 1 camera 1) all the way to (take 15 angle 1 camera 1) and I have done the same with my second camera and set the meta data as (take 1 angle 2 camera 2) (take 2 angle 2 camera 2) etc. Once all of that is set I select all 30 clips and click ""Make Multi-Clip"" I kept all of my settings on automatic and use audio for sync.  when it is finished I opened the Multicam clip and all of my footage from both of my cameras are there in the right order but only the first two takes are synced.
 
     I thought this might be a glitch so I tried again and the same thing happened
 
     Does anyone have experience with this and using FCP X's Multicam feature to put multiple takes in the same clip? I have done several hours of research and not found any tutorials on this. Only people syncing many angles on one take. Any help will be much appreciated I am getting really frustrated with this and I hope I am just overlooking something. Please advise.

My main concern is that I ended up in the middle where it's not clear if I wanted to do a satire or an actual dramatic trailer
