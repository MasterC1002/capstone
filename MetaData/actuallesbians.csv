It didn't really sink in for one kid who one day went off on another kid calling him gay
I had enough and sent him to the office to talk to our wonderful AP hoping she could make a point. 
He came back later and I didn't really want to confront him at all but thought it would only be meaningful if he had a follow-up.
I sat down next to him on the front steps of a classroom and asked him if he understood why you can't use slurs or generalized references like that of any kind.
We had a good talk about how it might affect the kids that ARE gay in the school. 

He turned his head to me and said
And I said yes. He paused, ""Wait, so you like girls?""
- ""yes...""
""But
I said no and he goes...""Ok...well

A week later, ""If you were gay or if someone went around saying that's so *insert student name* then you would be upset and that's just not very nice, regardless of what you think about people being gay in the first place. We should all just be nice and laughing at people isn't.""

There is however

First of all we want you to realize that we (the moderators) have no control over who has access to this subreddit. We try to create a space that is as safe as possible towards queer women. But reddit simply isn't the place and doesn't have the tools to create a TRULY safe space. There is no way for us to keep people with bad intentions of this subreddit

As such we would like to remind you that such people are possibly lurking around this subreddit. And ask that you take the neccesary precautions for your own safety. We certainly don't want to discourage you from finding a partner on AL

We'd like to conclude with a few pieces of advice on staying safe.

1. Meet in public. We can't stress this enough!
2. Let friends/family know that you are meeting this person. Let them know where you are. Agree to call this person after an agreed upon time. So that if you don't call
3. Get in a video conversation (skype for example) with the person. At least this way you know the person isn't deceiving you about how they look. People can still trick you even after this
4. Get the persons facebook or other social media. It's easy to make fake profiles

**Anyone else have any advice? Feel free to share them in the comments

She's been struggling this year with boys at school and her mixed feelings about them.  All the while, the look in my daughters eyes when she watched her friend, the level of affection they share, it was very obvious to me that they were much more than just friends, and just so adorable together.  We had a discussion after dropping her friend off Sunday evening, and she acknowledged that they were developing into a couple.  

Today, a very short pixie cut, like her friend.  This evening, I was joking with her that her friends at school are definitely going to be making lesbian jokes now that she's rocking her new style.  She said they've all been saying that she and her friend were a couple anyways, so let them.  I asked her, ""So, you're gay"", ""I'm gay.""

1356550166.0,15ha8u,"On dating trans women and ""transphobia"".",Heterogenic,549,136,530,"The subject of trans women as romantic partners (or not) comes up often on this reddit
  
Let's start with some basics:  
============================================
  
__Things which **are not** transphobic:__  
  
* Not being interested in
* Not being interested in
* Not being interested in
  
__Things which **are** transphobic:__  
  
* Not being interested in
  
Trans women are women.  They are often indistinguishable from cis women.  They can't get pregnant, but purely in prejudice.  It's not like not being attracted to redheads or blondes or butches, it's like not being attracted to immigrants, children of blue-collar workers or survivors of cancer.  ""Trans"" is, for the numerical majority of trans women, a history which says nothing about the person.  
  
  
Other common fallacies:  
============================================
  
* I've never been attracted to a trans woman
  
Besides the obvious selection bias
  
If you are attracted to women
  
  
* Ewwww
  
You aren't into penii.  I get it, so you have that in common at least.  But *many trans women don't*, and many of those who do won't for long.  Be careful about using this biased sample to rule out all trans women.  
  
Also, because he clearly doesn't understand how sexytimes work; when I hear a lesbian rule out trans women because of the presence of a hidden penis I feel sorry for her partner, because how superficial is that?  
  
It's valid to be not into penii.  this is
  
  
* Transphobia == evil/mean/bad/poopy.  
  
Transphobia is, any more than it is an insult to be called trans.  
  
I'm a bit androphobic.  I accept and own that, but it doesn't give me the right to say ""all men are evil/rapists"".  
  
In the context of attraction: if you realize you dislike or are not attracted to trans women as a rule, you should recognize that it is *your* problem and not anyone else's.  If you are fortunate enough to have a trans person in your social circle, perhaps you could even try to overcome it. 
  
  
* Trans women are all *X*.  
  
Trans women are all trans.  Lesbians are all women who are attracted to women.  This is a tautological definition
  
  
  
Finally
------------------------------------------
  
The trans women who come in here and start these conversations are often on the most angsty leg of a very tumultuous journey.  Try not to add to their fears with pedantic or broad statements about their future courtships.  If you're 100% sure that you would never date a trans/black/Jewish/butch/immigrant woman
  
When you speak up to specifically exclude trans women from your romantic prospects *in a context defined by courtship* (ie: LGBT spaces)
  
I now live in the Boston area, which has become the norm).  The lesbian community is one, and these conversations are why.  I get a little sad about that sometimes.",,False,,t5_2rch0,,http://www.reddit.com/r/actuallesbians/comments/15ha8u/on_dating_trans_women_and_transphobia/

So I asked my girl on June 13th to marry me and she said YES! here are some pics on how I did it. It was a slight production that she describes as ""a fairytale"". I wanted to thank each and every one of you ALs who said such kind and inspiring words. Find your best friend

She was blindfolded and taken to an undisclosed location. This is what she saw when she took her blindfold off. During this I had our song playing in the background.

Thats me standing at the end with sparklers. 
Then she got to me and I handed her one.

I drop down and my friends light off like 100 fireworks! This is the moment I wanted captured during all the planning.

After she finally dried her tears and realized what happened she said yes. (took her like 20min to say yes through all the tears)
We are so happy together :)

I want to tell you how perfect you are to me. Your gorgeous hair, your terrific lips.... and that's not even an eighth of the wonderful things that I love about you. That's only a fraction of your outer beauty.
I can't even begin to tell you about your inner beauty. Partly because you've heard it all before, your intelligence, your passion, your unconditional support. I am so crazy lucky to have you in my life, and even luckier to be able to call you mine.

I am so in love with you. I don't ever want you to think that I'm not. I don't ever want you to think that I'm sick of you, because you'd have to do a hell of a lot (and you haven't done anything yet to make me consider it.)

I love seeing my ankh around your neck. I gave it to you because I want you to carry a part of me with you everywhere you go. I'm sorry if that freaks you out.

I can't wait to fall asleep by you every single night

You're my best friend. You always will be. I am honoured to be able to call you anything more than that. You brighten my life more than anything.

I can't wait to hug and squeeze you and see that gorgeous smile again when you're done with that silly time-consuming final.

I love you.

I am currently seeking a girlfriend, because I didn't choose to be bi anymore than they chose to be gay. I've been on there for maybe a month, and sometimes I vent on /r/bisexual, but they already know all about this.

It is /r/actuallesbians which has the tendency to upset me. Today on here I read about lesbians feeling ""rage"" towards girls who can ""blend in"" and about how ""being bisexual is perfectly acceptable, wouldn't date them"" as though you are an exception! I would say the majority of lesbians don't want to date us. I know this subreddit caters towards women who have no romantic or sexual interest in men, but your sidebar welcomes us :(.

I don't like coming on here and reading justifications for ignoring bi women. Seriously. The fact that you don't like us is enough. If someone wrote

Straight married guy here.  I really like lurking around this subreddit as I love to hear your stories of acceptance

I wanted to share a neat story that just happened with my 7 year old.

Andrew and I were watching TV when this Expedia commercial came on....

(watch this commercial first if you haven't seen it already
http://www.youtube.com/watch?list=SP1F13DA942F400D82&amp;feature=player_embedded&amp;v=ThzdsnXeE28

We have never really said anything to him about same sex marriage

He was wondering what the commercial was about.  So I rewound

I only asked him ""tell me what you think"".

He said ""It's different"".

""What's different?""

""Two girls are getting married and kissing"".

""Yeah

""No.""

""Has anyone ever told you about men liking men

He seemed puzzled by this.

""No no one has talked to me about this.  Is it wrong? Why would it be wrong?""

How proud I was to hear this reaction!  I made sure not to set him up for anything but a pure answer without any inkling of how I felt about this

We then spoke about how of course, weight, etc. that this is also no reason to treat anyone different.

Then we had a good conversation about how proud I am with him for coming to that realization all on his own and for thinking critically about it.  We talked about how my good friend Dan likes men, tax benefits, and other benefits because we are married, but Dan does not and cannot until we pass laws saying that men can marry men and women can marry women.  He was even more puzzled.  Much more puzzled than what I had expected, even though he has never heard anything negative or positive regarding marriage equality and gays in general.

But the word ""gay"" or ""lesbian"" never came up.  I'm confident that he still has no idea what either of these words mean

We then talked about how as long as two people love each other

I can't tell you how proud this makes me

Growing up in the 70's and 80's, of course, but it's just so refreshing to hear the opinion of someone growing up in our modern times adopting a view completely independent of any outside influence, and his reaction was amazingly in favor of equality....to the point that he was even puzzled why on earth no one else would share this view.  Had I been asked the same question when I was 7, I'm not sure that I would reacted the same way, so we've come a long way!

I was nearly in tears with joy.  I'm a proud Dad!

Just wanted to share my wonderful experience with this nice group!

Brian

I just wanted to let you know the story behind the gifts that (Z) gave you today. Yesterday, unprompted by me. As soon as we got home, he got started. He spent the entire afternoon working diligently on the gifts, wrapping them with care and minimal assistance from me, and creating cards to accompany them. He must have worked on this project for two hours straight, without taking breaks or losing interest, something which very rarely happens at our house! I wanted to tell you all of this because this is the very first time that (Z), has done something like this

---

My heart swelled and I made him a thank you card with Batman giving him a thumbs up because that's one of his more consistent obsessions. He is such a sweet kid along with the rest of my students. I love them all.

I just wanted to share something that made me happy before the holidays.

More and more frequently I've been seeing posts on this subreddit that use the word 'retarded' in a derogatory way. Tell me, fag, dyke - when people use these terms in degrading ways, it hurts. We cannot perpetuate the hate. Using words like 'retarded' as demeaning slurs is simply unacceptable. Let's clean up our language and spread the message that everyone is beautiful, just as they are.

Girl keeps looking my direction but I'm not going to give her the satisfaction of eye contact. We are about to leave for the next bar. I need to walk past her to get to the door.

I put my hand on her lower back and say ""sweet heart

Wiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiinnnnnnn! Thanks awesome lesbian. You gave me a line that destroyed a homophobe.

I, I haven't had much experience with girls other than making out and the occasional roaming of my hands down south. I've never fully explored a woman's body until her but I still felt less of a lesbian because I was still unsure of what to do. We've been together for a couple of months now and I was never able to make her orgasm. I always stopped in the middle of what I was doing because I thought it wasn't going anywhere. But the other night was different. She spent a few days with me before school started back and I promised myself I would **not** let her leave without me making her orgasm. 





I woke her up to sex in the middle of the night and of course she obliged. I promised myself that if it took me forever to make her cum then so be it because I did not want to give up. I ripped her underwear off and went to town with just my mouth and fingers alone. Never have I ever had anyone call out my name. Never have I ever had anyone put their hands on top of my head moaning at me to not stop. And of course never have I ever made a girl cum before.... until now.

I'm 29 years old and it took over a decade for everything to come together.  I came out to my parents at the age of 17 and they promptly shamed me right back into the closet.  I was able to be out in college but feared entering an actual relationship due to my parents negative feelings about homosexuality.  I opted for one night stands and short flings.  I fell in love my junior year and when we were still together at the end of my senior year I attempted once again to come out to my parents because I wanted them to meet the woman I was in love with.  My father basically disowned me and while it tore my mother apart she didn't stand by me either.  Confused and alone I took a job that allowed me to move out of the country

While there and bored at work I would frequent a lesbian entertainment website and make small talk with gay ladies around the world.  I ended up randomly talking to a girl who lived in my homestate.  What started as jokes about the people and the area we had grown grew into us talking about everything for hours on end day after day.  With 2200 miles between us we never imagined it would move past friendship.  

I came home to visit friends from college and made a point to go meet the person I had been talking to for months.  There was an instant connection that could not be ignored.  I went back to California and after several more months and much apprehension of moving back and living close to my parents and all the painful memories I took a leap.  I found a job and an apartment and started dating the person who I now consider the love of my life (2 years together).  

I was able to reach out to my parents and after one very tearful night they opened their arms and hearts to me once again.  My father apologized for everything and held me in his arms and sang the song he used to sing to me as a child.  ""If I had to choose just one day, that one day, that may, that summer"" (lyrics changed because I was born in may).  For the first time in over a decade I was able to bring the woman I love home to meet my parents and while it was a nervous moment for everyone involved, everything was wonderful.

Really, body and spirit? Are you lazy and boring? Do you have the ovaries to ask someone out and risk rejection? Are you attractive? Are you a good friend, a reliable person, a compassionate human being?

I speak from experience here. I have never been a player, however, dated enough women and have gained the following insight in my hoary, aged state: No one wants to date a trainwreck. We're all a little screwy, sure, but If you're waiting for a mythical femme (bc apparently that is all anyone wants now) in shining armor to ride to your effed-up rescue on her unicorn of undying devotion, you are going to be one sad

Get a job. Get a bike. Get hobbies. Get educated. Get to a new town. Get involved. Get active. Get confidence. Pretty soon, but a woman who wants YOU and who wants to DO YOU because you're attractive and cool and interesting and you have your shit together. 

IF straight girls are your singular interest, while maintaining your own awesomeness. And you must accept that the odds are like 10-1 that they'll dump you for some dashing broturd if they get bored for 30 seconds. That's what you sign up for when you date straight girls, so be prepared, my little dyke scouts. 

Anyway, our desperate gasps from the void. I get that. But, there are LOTS of ladies in the world, some of whom are just waiting around for someone like your very best self to tickle their fancy and to possibly tickle some other things too. Stop whining, start getting your shit together and go get 'em, raptors.

""You're so gay. I know you're gay. You're a faggot."" and then *spit on me*.

After she said that, I was so mad). My coach and everyone on the sidelines was pretty pissed at me for losing my head, but the ref decided not to card me (honestly, I should've been carded) since the other girl had been beating on me the whole game.

So about ten minutes later, and this is the conversation that follows (the nasty girl was #13 on her team):

me: Just ignore her. This girl's a bigot and a homophobe.
#13: Wow! That's pretty judgmental!
me: Uh
#13: I did not! When did I say that?
me: 'You're so gay. I know you're gay. You're a faggot.'
#13: Well you don't have to be so judgmental. It's an expression.
me: I am gay
#13: I didn't mean it like that. It's just an expression.
me: Just like ""nigger"" is an expression?
#13: Yeah

And then she ran away to some other part of the field like a fucking coward.

Then the teammate that had been talking to her before that conversation came off the field. While she was off, I had only told about five people on the team about my sexuality (though honestly it's pretty obvious by looking at me) and planned on telling more as it came up in conversation. I'm a freshman, so it's my first year playing with this team.

Luckily

So it all worked out better than expected in a way. It's not really how I wanted to tell everyone

**TL;DR girl calls me faggot

1323202929.0,n2wfu,My Awesome (Straight) Best Friend vs.  My Homophobic Aunt.,clemka3,159,10,18,"Long story warning*****

I've been friends with my best friend (I'll call her Ash) since 6th grade. When they moved to middle-of-nowhere Southeast Mississippi, besides my dad, to stand by me through it all. Most of my other friends and family came back and apologized, or tolerate it, but she never left. That was a big deal to me. 

Anyway

Side-story: I have over 20 first cousins and, even though her 4 kids adore me and I work for next to nothing, she couldn't have me babysit until I decided that I wasn't really gay and repented. She said that she still loved me but that her kids were too impressionable and young to be exposed to the sin of homosexuality (as if I'd ever talk to 5 year olds about my sexuality). 

So I hadn't seen my cousins or aunt since June, ""Yeah, why?""

No answer. But she had an odd look on her face. 

We ran across and I got four giant bear hugs from four adorable little kids. The oldest, ""Stay here and catch candy with me! I want to stand by you! I missed you! Why don't you come babysit me anymore?"" All while clinging to me. It kinda broke my heart. My aunt was friendly but looked a little coldly at Ash. She asked ""Who is this? Your...friend?""
 I said, put her arm around me...overly ""friendly"". 

Then she told my aunt, Kate means a lot to me. More than 'family' means to most people."" 

I was shocked. 

After a few minutes

In front of tons of people I know

I turned so red that I could barely keep walking. She just casually led me into the Chinese restaurant, together, and ordered us two cokes. 

She's threated to do this before when people were being rude or staring st us, I'm not above holding your hand. Give them a damn reason to stare, homophobic assholes.""

I almost cried. The fact that she was willing to put her reputation on the line, to support me. 

Anyway

I'm pretty lucky to have her as a best friend.
