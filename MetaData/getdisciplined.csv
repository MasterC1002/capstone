I'm a bartender during the night at a popular club (I live in a tourist

My question is

I currently exercise regularly (lifting weights at the YMCA), really. . but not something I want to wake up and work from 9-5 on before my real job. I also eat quite clean and avoid drinking most of the time, unless it's a special occasion like a buddies birthday.

So my tl;dr question is this: **how can I productively fill my time for this summer

Obviously my first step is waking up earlier. Have been reading tips on that from this subreddit (just discovered this yesterday). Any help you guys have would be greatly appreciated!!

1364647053.0,1basf8,Weird trick that worked great for me.,madplayshd,616,68,55,"I heard this from another redditor and thought he was joking first

Basically, you simply do it. So how is this different from just doing it? Well, you dont only do it for difficult stuff, but for *everything*. Before you get up to order another beer, count to five. Before you shut down the computer and go to bed, count to five. Before you stand up and pee, count to five.

This way your brain starts to associate 'counting to five' with the impulse to do stuff. The trick here is that counting to five is easy, for example. Not anymore. I count to five and stand up. Works every time. Actually, I am now at the point where I would get up without counting anyway, but I still count, to reinforce the counting. I sometimes even have to restrict myself not to start counting just because a weird idea pops into my head.

Discipline is basically like a muscle. If you lived like a total slob for years you cannot expect to change into arnold overnight. If your goals are unrealistically high, it becomes more and more easy. Your discipline grows and you can now start to work on bigger stuff!

Another nice thing with this technique is that it helps you focus on discreet, you break it down to 'get up in the morning' 'brush teeth every evening' 'clean the house every week'. And by reaching those small goals, you not only start to feel good about yourself, suddendly you solved your big problem.",,False,,False,t3_1basf8
1373969869.0,1iel81,"The hidden enemy behind all failure - The urge of Anxiety and the ""Dopamine"" Craving",becomingmanofsteel,610,87,81,"Maybe you are a writer

Or maybe you are a programmer

You have to research a lot

You open the internet browser

If you are a writer you begin to doubt yourself about your credibility and start getting depressed. 

If you are a programmer you begin to doubt yourself about the architecture of the product. What if the product comes out all wrong?

Before you know you have started doing something that makes you feel good. It can be eating

*What is the **""hurricane""**?*

It is an urge. It can be anxiety, disgust etc. 

Our brains don't like feeling uncomfortable. Everytime you are attempting something beyond your skill level or doing something you have never done before, they will destroy your time before you will know it and stop you from working. 

*What is **""dopamine""**?*

It is a feel good chemical secreted in the brain when we enjoy something. It can be a movie or an experience or even your work. 

It gives a high that lasts for a short period of time. But the next time you attempt the same activity

Read the above paragraph again

So if you are getting a dopamine fix by watching porn

If you are doing substance abuse to escape from the uncomfort of taking responsibility for your life. You have to ingest more and more quantities of the same to get the dopamine kick. 

*The **""See-Saw""** of Life*

The more you get caught up in the ""hurricane"" (feeling afraid or depressed or anxious)

It also works the other way around. You want a dopamine kick by using a certain thing. To maintain the same level of high

More drugs will waste more money and more time. More porn and masturbation will waste more time and more money.

And even a little discomfort of anything will drop you into the ""hurricane"". Yes

Hiding these behaviours will lead to more anxiety and fear. And you get caught up in the vicious circle. 

This ""hurricane"" and ""dopamine"" are the two sides of the same coin. Its head's I win and tails you ""lose"". 

One more thing to remember is that all this behaviours are habits. These habits waste your time and make you weak. You are the average of your own habits. For example - 

Out of a 24 hour period - your emotional state distribution may be - 

* 7 hours sleep
* 4 hours hard at work (in a flow)
* 2 hours angry or negative
* 2 hours anxious or afraid
* 1 hour lazy
* 2 hours depression
* 1 hour exercise
* 5 hours dopamine binge (internet or/and partying or/and movies or/and substance abuse)

These are habits. Just before you waste time

*What is the **way out**?*

It's a plain old thing called ""mindfulness"". It is not rocket science. 

It's being aware of your own thoughts, you begin to recognise the urges as they start to rise. 

It is a skill that is learnable. The more skilled you are in observing these urges

The choice to do the important hard work that builds your skills or wasting time on the internet. 

The choice to help someone or waste time feeling despair and depression. 

The choice to bravely make a difference or being a coward (and watch porn). 

*How to learn the skill called **mindfulness**?*

There are numerous teachers and institutes that teach it. I chose [this place](http://www.dhamma.org/) since they taught it for free

Just remember this skill takes a lifetime to master. You will just be able to learn the basics in 10 days. 

You can also read this book [Mindfulness in Plain English](http://www.urbandharma.org/udharma4/mpe.html). But just reading it won't help. I would recommend going on a course where you will learn it from a qualified teacher. 

And no mindfulness is not Buddhism

*Will I get something if I practice ""mindfulness"" or I will just loose all my favourite emotional states?*

You will find a few emotional states increasing in time duration and intensity. You will be more equanimous

""Inner peace"" is a term that represents the state of mind when it is in the above four emotions. Please note that ""inner peace"" can make you very uncomfortable and painful when you are helping others and solving their problems. The point is not being anxious or afraid or negative. Problems of all kinds (death, separation or hard work) are painful. 

So gradually your emotional habits will change and these will become your major emotions. 

*What is being ""equanimous""?*

An equanimous person does not gets subdued by failure or gets too happy when succeeding. Such a person works in a calm

Maybe it is you when you wake up and make breakfast for your kids. Maybe it is you when you are working in your job and solving problems. Maybe it is when you are vounteering in a non profit in work that changes lives. 

This emotion is a part of you. Mindfulness would increase this part the most. 

The practice will also increase in small amounts compassion and sympathy. You will find yourself doing random acts of kindness for family and strangers. You may find yourself actively volunteering for some cause. And you will feel the pain of the others around you.

*How has it helped me?*

Change has been gradual. There have been ups and downs. When I started, finished college, got a job, paid off my debt, quit my job and become a freelancer. 

I am currently struggling as a freelancer. I am quite prone to anxiety and fear attacks. The above two examples of the writer and the programmer are taken from my personal life. 

This is a brief snapshot of my habits before 4 years. 

Before Mindfulness - emotional habits over a period of 24 hours - 

* 6 hours sleep
* 0 hours hard at work (in a flow)
* 4 hours working/studying angry or negative
* 4 hours working anxious or afraid
* 2 hours depression
* 1 hour exercise
* 3 hours anxious on internet (searching for magic bullet or just random reading)
* ~4 hours dopamine binge (gaming or movies or porn or just with friends)
* 10 mins meditation - mostly mantra meditation
* 0 hours volunteering

After practising mindfulness for 4 years - emotional habits over a period of 24 hours. 

* 7 hours sleep 
* 6 hours hard at work (4 hours in a flow + 2 hours)
* 0 hours working angry or negative
* 2 hours working anxious or afraid (generally when deadlines are to met)
* 15 mins depressive thoughts
* 1.5 hours exercise
* 3 hours anxious + dopamine binge on internet (searching for magic bullet or right architecture or being a perfectionist or just random reading)
* 30 mins dopamine binge (mostly youtube videos) - gave up gaming and porn
* 1 hour - 2 hours Vipassana meditation (Sitting meditation and being aware of breath
* 1 hour - 2 hours - volunteering (A few times a week

I am still learning mindfulness. I have made some baby steps over the past few years. 

One important thing this practice has made me realise that I am completely responsible for myself - physically, I do go down on the rabbit hole of the internet searching for the magic bullet about anything related to coding or architecture or others. Old habits die hard.)

*So there I was.*

It was late afternoon. I had gone through all of my youtube videos and blog posts about how to stop procrastinating. I was ""prepared"" to get work done. After a particularly productive morning

I shuffled around my apartment, and setting up my work space. Only after every miscellaneous object was put back into place, leaving me no other small tasks to complete did I realize. Oops, I did it again.

I was running out of time, and I really had nothing to show for it. It's not like I was busy with *friends* or anything. My chronic procrastination was getting the best of me. 

Despite everything I had done that morning to set myself up for success

I took a second to recognize my emotional state. What was it that was keeping me from moving? Then it hit me. **I'm obsessed with failure**.

---

*Why you're probably here.*

If you're like me

---

*Change your focus

It's a really simple thing that you can do

1. **Notice when you get that scary feeling in your chest.**
Once  your brain starts to remind you off all those times you screwed up, and accept it. *Mediation and yoga are a great ways to learn how to do this. Try [this video](http://youtu.be/0o0kNeOyH98) and see how you like it.*

2. *The Trick*: ***Think about how it will feel once you accomplish these tasks.***
Your thoughts have ""gravity."" When you think of your past failures, believe it, and eventually do it.

3. *Clock in.* By this time you should start to feel a little excited at the prospects of completing the tasks. Take a few minutes and just feel good for a little bit. Smile :). You're ok. **Block off a set time to begin working.** Be generous with the amount of time you give yourself to just chill

4. Simple. **Start.** Once that time comes **set a timer** for about 20 minutes. This will be your tool of the trade. Here's a simple [online timer](http://www.online-stopwatch.com/countdown-timer/), focus ONLY on writing down the steps to completing your project. ~~Over~~Estimate how long each substep will take. Decide which ones you want to complete during your block time.  Work in blocks of 20-25 and give yourself 10-15 minute breaks. 

---
*You are on your way*

Know that you're not going to be a workbot immediately. It's going to take some repetition and a few unproductive days

If you practice something similar, **please let me know if this worked for you.** If it didn't, I'd like to know that too! I'm considering starting a blog, documenting my journey from ""hot mess"" to success. Feedback will help me improve my posts. Thanks in advance!

You should workout more).

* **2. Read books**

It started out as only 15 minutes a day, training etc. By reading books you'll become smarter, sharper, more interesting and learn from the experience of other wise individuals. Through reading, you will discover ideas and certain mentalities that will further enhance your life, and you will expand upon them to create what you may call yourself. 

* **3. Keep a journal** 

Either buy a book you can write in with pen or use the computer to keep a journal. You can either write down a few lines on what happened that day or, mark down the date and write. There are times where I am really tired and nothing really interesting happened that specific day so I just jot down a few words, and other times I can write several pages on different thoughts, ideas etc. Get your thoughts down on paper. If you want, you can add a quote to every post and reflect on it, as I do. Always write down the best positive experience of the day. You will find yourself being more aware of the positive things that happen throughout the day by doing this. If not for yourself, do it for your kids and grandchildren. If my mom or dad were to keep a journal throughout their life I would read every single bit of it. Your children and/or grandchildren would want to read yours. 

* **4. Sleep more**

Go to bed earlier

* **5. ~~Spend less time on the computer~~ Spend less time being unproductive on the computer and instead do things that matter**

Limit you time on the computer every day. Spend more time with friends, i.e building websites, making art etc., then of course this does not apply. My point being is that people usually does not spend their time on it like that, and use it as a distraction, as I did for several years.  If you do creative and wonderful things on the computer, I would not dream of denying you that. However,,1362145588.0,t3_19f1im

There's nothing worse than coming home after a stressful day of whatever to a trashed room. Whether you're the type who throws their clothes all over the floor

It might seem overwhelming at first. That pile of clothes will take at least an hour to hang up. If I pick up the plates

1. Your room is (or should be) your slice of the world which offers you peace and comfort. It's such a good feeling to come back from work, whatever and opening the door to your room to find a made bed and no clutter. I'm sure many of y'all lead stressful lives, so why should something so easy to control become another stressor? Whenever my room is messy, it's just another reason to get down on yourself. Save yourself the trouble. Clean your fuckin' room. 

2. Your room is a reflection of yourself. Again

3. There have been so many times where I had let the state of my room get out of control. In one particular instance, my bed wasn't made, the whole room smelled a bit, and my bathroom was a mess. My roommates decided to have a party when I had to study all night, so I was unaware that people would be going into my room to use my bathroom. I was mortified. How many people had seen my room like this? They must have all thought I was a huge slob. I felt like crap. You'll never know who will see your room or what they will think because of what they see in it. Save yourself the embarrassment, clean your fuckin' room. 

4. It is a simple way to make yourself feel good. Do you feel like you haven't been productive today? Do you feel gross or uncomfortable in your own room? Get up and clean. Just start doing it. Start small. Pile up the plates, max) you'll be done. The reward is a space--your space--that is there to comfort you and keep you relaxed. Reward yourself, clean your fuckin' room. 

5. Getting in the habit of always keeping your room clean helps you live an overall disciplined life. Wake up, so I chose to clean my room in the 50 or so minutes I had. I felt productive and proud, as well as motivated for the rest of the day. Live a disciplined life, clean your fuckin' room. 

I hope this wasn't too patronizing, it became clear that keeping a clean room was essential to living better. You might feel overwhelmed with the idea, but what has always helped me was to read things about being motivated or disciplined. That way I kind of get ""high"" on the idea of living a better life and become instantly charged to do *something*. Cleaning your fuckin' room is a perfect something. Just fuckin' do it.

**Here is my update. 23 Feb 2013 One Year Later**

In February I was in the process of idea generation. I tried EVERYTHING. Web design for businesses, PPC advertising, building my own niche sites, building affiliate sites, I considered buying a hotdog cart and selling hotdogs, I thought about creating the ""next"" reddit. Lots and lots of ideas. With the overarching intent of creating financial freedom so that I would not have to work a soul-draining 9-5 as an Accountant(I have my degree in Accounting).

In June of 2012 I finally hit on an idea that had potential. Create a website and youtube channel that combines fitness and gaming. This played perfectly with who I am and what my passions were. I've probably spent a good 20% of my entire waking hours playing video games

* [Here is a screenshot of my earnings for that May and June (the first two months Healthy Gamer was live.)](http://i.imgur.com/q96qani.jpg)

Please don't take this post as a boastful post. My true intent here is to show some DOCUMENTED PROOF of the effectiveness of the principles I wrote about in that thread in Feb of 2012.

**One year ago this time I had - almost no understanding of how to build websites. No knowledge of how to edit video. No knowledge of how to be successful on youtube. No skills in speaking in videos. No connections online aside from posting in internet forums.**

What I did have was an intent

And obstacles aplenty there have been. In September of 2012 I got REALLY depressed. Things weren't going as I had planned/hoped for Healthy Gamer. My earnings were plummeting. Diablo 3 - the game I had covered almost exclusively was dying. Guild Wars 2

I started losing all of my discipline. Was fapping 3-5x a day again. Was staying up until 5-6am and not waking up until 3pm in the afternoon. I become completely anti-social and literally lost my confidence overnight. I didn't make any updates to the website or youtube channel for about 2.5 months.

But I did eventually pull myself together and get re-disciplined. It started with meditation. I am of the belief that meditation is like that swiss army knife. With meditation

So I started meditating again regularly. Then I set goals again. Then from there it was an explosion of discipline and motivation. I've woken up at 5am for the last seventeen days straight. Have been able to create constant content for the website and youtube and actively improving the quality of each post. The website really is at a point where it is primed for exponential growth. I have done two interviews for local news stations who liked my idea of helping gamers become healthy.

It's been over 120 days since I've watched porn and more than 45 days since I've fapped. 

Looking back on this last year I would say that it certainly has not been easy. It's taken a load of effort. But it's been absolutely worth it. Day to day you will have ups and downs. You need to stay focused on your overarching goals and realize that human beings naturally to have good days and bad days. It is natural to have swings in your mood. It is natural to have swings in your motivation.

Consider on the other hand, and even then you are constantly trying to improve.

As minimalists we have said we will remove all garbage from our lives so that we can focus on what makes us happy and brings meaning to our lives -- yet so many of us are drawn to the low hanging fruit.

I've seen many people on this subreddit say they spend their time playing video games

Have you ever wondered why so many people ask ""well if you don't watch TV what do you do?"" ""Aren't you bored?"" -- people who want to quit playing video games have to ask what they could possibly spend their time doing instead.

What people are really searching for is the low hanging fruit. This easy steady drip of happiness. Their question is

I myself have struggled with this. I want to quit video games, but what do you do that doesn't take so much work?"" -- I mean who really spends a whole day wood working or walking? They must fill the rest of their time somehow? Where is their easy drip?

Now imagine for a second. What if there were no easy drips? No easy way to get a steady stream of happiness? What if all your happiness and satisfaction and meaning had to be worked for -- hard effort must be applied to everything you do before the happiness will arrive.

You might sit on your ass all day and drink beer

You will find that you will still seek happiness and especially a deep satisfaction with your life. And so you don't sit there blind waiting for something easy to show up

You find these hobbies

Each week you will achieve new accomplishments

Eventually you get addicted to these bigger rushes of happiness, video games, or other things.

Addendum:

I think we experience this addiction to hard but satisfying activities on some level.

You might spend most of your day in front of the television

You might be a runner

Ask these people

I'm sure you have something in your life that you feel the same about. It's the deep happiness and satisfaction you feel that makes you so protective over this hard hobby.

We all have these addictions to activities which provide us with bigger flows of happiness

What I am suggesting is that if we can remove all of the easy drips of happiness

Picture whatever it is that grants you so much happiness right now

Now imagine if every moment of your day was spent doing activities like it which granted you the same amount of satisfaction

Each day would hold 10x the amount of happiness, month, and year were well spent.

Here it is: The heuristic with which I regularly torture myself looks like ""I am happy when I improve"" and ""I am unhappy when I stand still"". Until today I think I truly believed this rationally too. Happiness is being your best. The effect of the heuristic can be seen in that I regularly feel very bad that I wasted time. It can also be seen by my enormous effort to improve. Now the question is: Why on earth would I really become happy when I improve

It looks like lots of improvement is haltered by my sadness, when you are able, to think that you are bad for standing still. Stop thinking you did wrong yesterday, last month, last year. You were not wrong, you simply stood still, and that is ok, and if being happy involves stopping to slap yourself for not improving

In another perspective you might say that the first improvement of your life and happiness is to stop blaming non-improvement.

1366915998.0,1d3mdw,Problems with waking up on time/getting up in the mornings? Here's the solution,throwawaysdlfjdlsjfl,305,45,43,"[If you don't want to read the wall of text

Typical scenario: it's 1pm by the time you finally drag yourself out of bed, running late. Whatever your particular situation is, you're pissed off at yourself and the fact that you can never get up on time, and that it's always such a struggle.

First off, or laziness, or some personal flaw/failure. it's easy to feel like your personal weakness is the problem, and think that by punishing yourself for it, it will resolve the issue in the future. that's the default response that people have to failure, in general. however, that response is incredibly ineffective at creating helpful changes. so, because they are only an emotional response, neither of which is conducive to achievement.

so, ambiguous goals. you think ""i'd like to get up on time tomorrow"" the night before, or you think ""fuck, i feel like today is wasted, i wish i had gotten up on time today"" during the day, but these are not specific enough goals. ""getting up on time"" is a very vague goal, and vague goals are useless because they don't have specific conditions of success or failure, or identify when you've been successful

so start with a very specific goal. for example: ""as soon as my alarm goes off tomorrow, you will instantly know if you succeeded or failed- if you succeed, great, you've got it. if you fail, great, now you are closer to pinpointing the problem, and can truly understand WHY failure occurred (but remember to leave emotion and blame and self-punishment out of this

now that you've set a goal, so if i do this, i'll avoid that feeling 3) if i do this, i'll have time to have a nice breakfast, long shower, etc., whatever motivates you. REMEMBER THESE

next, i am making the decision to do this right now. i know that i will have to combat [identify common excuses you use to stay in bed/not stick to your goals]. i know it will be hard at first, and i may fail, but i realize that blaming and getting upset at myself for failure will never help me, and instead i should look at failures as valuable information to use to correct the failure, and that i want to FIX the problem, not merely blame myself for it if it happens."" tweak this to whatever you need

now, think of your REASONS and how much you WANT it, you have to know WHY you're doing this, so that you can combat the voice that's saying ""just 5 more minutes"" or ""i don't want to get up"" or a thousand other excuses that will try to talk you out of doing anything difficult.

this all is a good start

TIPS:

1. Drink water the night before, but it works great

2. Make the habit of getting out of bed IMMEDIATELY when your alarm goes off. don't event think, and you don't give the inner voice a chance to talk you out of it. after just a few days, it will be so automatic that you'll be out of bed and standing up without even thinking about it, every time your alarm goes off. practice this the night before, by lying in bed pretending it's the next morning, and jumping up when you hear (or pretend) your alarm goes off, and you'll be amazed how easy it is to do the next day

3. Put your alarm far away. no need to go crazy here, you either need to get more sleep, or make significant changes to your life, because you are not motivated at all by what you're currently doing with your life. waking up should be the best part of your day, because you get to go back to doing what you love. if you aren't spending your life doing what you love, i suggest your realize that you only get ONE chance at life, you don't get a re-do, this is it, then don't worry about it. as long as YOU feel that you're living the way you want

4. Always get up, and never let yourself get discouraged. you need persistence, because eventually, even if it takes a week, you'll realize that you aren't going to let yourself off the hook, so you may as well just stop fighting it and get up on time. if you know that you're GOING to get up eventually, it's a lot easier to realize that fighting it is only counterproductive.

5. Sleep in multiples of 1.5 hours- for most people that means 6hrs or 7.5hrs of sleep a night (9 will cause issues, then put yourself off peak by sleeping more. this matches circaidian rhythms or some shit like that, doesn't really matter you can look up the science and stuff if you're interested, but the point is that you can feel more rested off of 4.5 hours of sleep waking up right on time than you can off of 8 hrs but waking up off peak. try it, and it will blow your mind. give yourself 15 minutes or so to fall asleep, and calculate your time that way. 

6. Buy a space heater and a timer. Set it so that it heats up your room before you wake up. You can use this two ways: 1) if your room is cold, or 2) if you really need a drastic measure, set it so that it will be blazing hot in your room by the time you want to wake up. that way, instead of your bed being a nice warm comforting place that you want to stay, it will be a goddamn sauna of sweat and 'oh god get me out of here right now'. basically a space heater is just a way to make what you want (being out of the bed) more desireable, and/or what you don't want (being in bed) less desirable.

7. Put a light on a timer to turn on about 5 minutes before you wake up. The light helps make your body realize that it's time to get up. also, plus it 'feels' more like you should get up when it's bright out

8. Go to sleep and wake up at the same time every day (or as often as possible). This may be inconvienient for many people, you may find that it's worth waking up early even on days you don't have to, simply to keep the trend going, because your body will very quickly adapt to a sleep schedule (just think of how fast you adjust to jet lag), and you'll begin to wake up right around the time your alarm goes off every morning. also, going to sleep at the same time every night will make that easier too. our bodies LOVE schedules, and will adapt to them quite readily

hope this helps

After giving up alcohol

Those conclusions can be boiled down to a pretty simple hunch: if you drink regularly, how insidiously, it's working against your goals until you try going without it, at least for a little while.

I don't mean to sound like Carrie Nation's hatchet here, you don't have to be hitting the liquor store three times a day, or spending your weekends in the drunk tank, or puking in the bathroom at work, to at least pose the question of whether your life might be improved by the absence of alcohol. Especially if you're a part of this subreddit, looking to improve your life through conscious effort.

Alcohol is a cheap thrill. This is true as a simple matter of brain chemistry. It hot-wires your brain's reward system and drives off with it. And whereas your brain normally tends to cooperate with self-discipline, or connection with another human being, alcohol turns that equation on its head. Those positive activities become relatively less rewarding; the carrot at the end of the stick gets smaller.

For me, to take possession of my emotional states, in every aspect of my life. I no longer struggled (as much) to not overeat and to exercise. Books and articles I had been meaning to read for months were finished and placed back on the shelf. I felt productive and engaged at work, instead of bored and put-upon. I realized how many relationships I had been neglecting or taking for granted. It was like the volume was suddenly turned back up on the rest of my life.

And that's without even talking about the surge of energy. This is something people talk about a lot in connection with sobriety, bleary, twitchy insomnia. I wanted to be up and about and getting on with my life and doing things. If I'm being honest, it felt a little like that first hit of cocaine, except this was my body creating that feeling naturally. My days suddenly seemed to have more hours in them. 

And that brings me to my final point. Consider how much time alcohol costs. Consider how long you had to work to make the money you're drinking. Consider the hours, spent feeling, if not hungover, then just kind of off, sluggish, down. Consider whether the bars and liquor stores you patronize are places you would consider spending a nanosecond if they didn't have alcohol. Consider whether the Good Times you had with your drinking buddies seem nearly as good in retrospect as they did at the time. At best, it's all time not spent working towards your goals.

My point here is not to claim that everyone who drinks is an alcoholic

At the very least, or for two weeks, or for a month, or whatever makes sense to you. I promise that at least some part of the experience will surprise you. And if it turns out to be harder to give it up than you thought it would be, know that [help](http://aa.org/) is closer than you might think.

I'm currently a student in my 2nd year of Economics at university. In school I was always amongst the best in my class, getting more and more lazy, not doing my homework etc. 

But when I started university, I got even lazier, especially since I've been living alone. 

My first year went okay though, except for the finals.
But this year, and barely studied for the finals. Result: I failed my first semester.
I now need to get a good average grade on my second one to compensate, I still am not motivated, and if I keep on going like this I'll fail the whole year.

Also, does his assignments, asks questions, goes further into every chapter, and yet still manages to go out and have fun. And I feel really stupid when sometimes he asks for my help for an assignment or something, and I have no idea what he's talking about because I didn't even open my book. I just don't wanna be the girl who doesn't understand anything, who's gonna fail her year... and I certainly don't wanna ask him for help (because he tends to be slightly patronising sometimes).

I don't know, going on r/funny or Facebook... I used to force myself to go to the library (where I'd do some really good studying) but now I always find reasons not to go...
So here's my question: how can I find the motivation I had before? How do I stop being lazy/procrastinating?

I read the book Overachievement by John Elliot and he suggested creating more chaos in your life to help sharpen your concentration and productivity. This principle is based on the fact that the best achievers in life have been in the midst of a performance ridden with sickness (tiger woods), and used these to sharpen their focus. I experimented with this and it turned out to be a tremendous success. 

I loaded up my schedule based on constructive decisions. Let me give you an example. My main goal is to retake the GRE so I can get into Physical Therapy school.

1357519148.0,1638in,How Green Tea Made Me Superhuman,LoveandFreedom,309,90,68,"Although most people don’t realize it

This is my story of green tea

In 2007 I started working full-time for an education consulting company that was chock-full of caring, eating healthy, non-violent communication, &amp; occasionally crystal healing.

It was a wonderful, asking them how their life could be better, &amp; confronting their limiting beliefs.

All my co-workers were doing the same thing. So it was essentially a boiler room operation

One of the many benefits of this job was that it forced me to examine my own life more closely. I had been struggling to get into a meditation practice for years — I knew intellectually that meditation was the right thing to do

I knew all these good things to do: I just lacked the willpower to do them on any sort of regular basis.

Luckily

I started drinking green tea.

I started drinking a lot of green tea.

You might think that this would be a totally innocuous life change

The apparent cause of this change was reading a short article that presented evidence that Japanese men who drank 4-6 cups of green tea daily had reduced rates of cancers of all kinds. This isn’t the article in question

When confronted with a cancerous cell

I remember thinking: “Ok

And so I did.

It was as simple as picking up a $2 box of green tea bags from Trader Joes and double-brewing two tea bags in the morning as soon as I arrived at work, especially since I left the tea bags steeping until I finished the full 12 oz mug (a practice that many tea connoisseurs would surely frown upon; I, however, grew to love the bitter, acidic, over-steeped taste.)

It was the simplest of habits

The caffeine gave me a nice, when my brain automatically decided it was time for a nap.

This habit, since evidence suggests that ascorbic acid increases the bioavailability of the catechins.) It became my ritual in the same way that some people’s ritual was to hit up Starbucks for a double espresso each morning.

And it changed my life.

First, but important. Secondly, and vastly more important, it demonstrated to me that a healthy life  habit could be put on autopilot — literally, that once this healthy habit was established, it gave me more energy than it took for me to maintain it — i.e., it was now adding more benefit to my life than it cost in terms of time or mental effort.

That one example was all I needed to convince me that I could follow this procedure to turn my entire life around.

If I could become master of my habits, in essence, superhuman. I could rise above my own frailties, the ill health and time-wasting blocks to performance that had plagued my life till then.

This idea was

The rest, and divide it up into 5 Tupperware portions. This put my healthy-eating choice on automatic for 33% of the meals I would eat during the week — and from there, it wasn’t  hard to automate my breakfast and, to a lesser degree, dinner. (For years, it was quinoa, bell peppers, and grass-fed buffalo meat for lunch

Next up was meditation.  After struggling for the previous 5 years, I opened each day with study of various wisdom texts. The year 2012 included a 10-day Goenka Vipassana meditation retreat and the stunning and reassuring realization that an infinite wellspring of creativity was waiting for me in the silence of meditation. This is the reason I recommend meditation so strongly to everyone, and especially to creative people: you lose all your anxiety about “production” of your art when you realize you can always “go to the Well” to get more inspiration &amp; guidance.

Next I automated my gym attendance, some of the deepest peace I have experienced mentally has come after this double-hit.

The magic of these habits is that they become automatic

This additional time “at work” when no one else was around allowed me to absolutely crush my targets and goals

Understanding how to hack healthy habits into my life literally turned me from an average, while bringing me into a life of deeper peace, serenity, and calm as a benefit.

It was this foundation of healthy habits that gave me the base from which to leave this same company at which I had learned so much in 2012

So, or eventually. Consider these the best investments you will ever make in yourself.

Take healthy eating, you are spending more money up front, but almost certainly reducing your health care costs into the indefinite future — as well as getting the up-front benefit of better health, better energy, healthier teeth, more stable moods, &amp; etc.  Up front investment

If you want to be a superhuman

Start small. Anchor your new habit to an existing habit (like getting up in the morning). Repeat it until it is automatic. Then add something else.

It only takes one to start.

&gt;**Comfort matters**. If you're hungry, sleep and make time for fun.

&gt;**Nurture discipline.** Build a routine of positive and negative reinforcement. If you want a child to eat their vegetables, or working in a team - social pressure can influence Rex.  

&gt;**Incite emotion.** Your reptile brain responds to emotion. That is its language. So get yourself pumped, for a while. I use dramatic music (one of my favourite playlists is called Music to conquer worlds by). Picture the bliss associated with getting something done, or the horrors of failing. Make your imagination vivid enough that it shakes you. We use similar tricks on children for a reason: ""brush your teeth or they'll fall out"".

&gt;**Force a start.** The most important thing you can do is start. Much of Rex's instincts are to avoid change

&gt;**Bias your environment.** Rex is short sighted and not terribly bright. If he sees a Facebook icon, turn off email. Have separate places for work and fun, and ideally separate computers (or at least accounts).

Nobody is able to permanently sustain a habit that makes them feel bad. If you find motivation to do something like eat raw broccoli every day for dinner

If doing something makes you miserable

People are able to pick up and keep ""good"" habits only when it feels good to keep them. The only people who work out every day are the ones who like working out.

Furthermore, your body, your life, are all way, way, too big to possibly be controlled.

You can't make yourself do anything. You don't call the shots - your *self* does.

But this is good because you don't need to! Humans are the only thing that try to will-power something into existence. Entire mountains

If you really want to influence how things go, feeling inferior to all those motivational speakers and /r/getdisciplined OPs who exercise everyday and run five successful businesses simultaneously - then it's likely you're being pretty hard on yourself.

Give yourself a break! Cut yourself some slack. You're good! There's nothing wrong with you. Everything's fine

In their article [""The Role of Basal Ganglia in Habit Formation""](http://people.duke.edu/~hy43/role%20of%20basal.pdf) Yin and Knowlton mention that it is well established that goal-directed behaviors can form habits. They use the example of flipping a light switch because we predict that we will achieve our desire of illuminating the room we are entering. But sometimes we flip the light switch habitually, to the point that the program need not be suggested by the prefrontal cortex, i.e. it requires no volition. For tasks which are especially difficult to perform we experience this process as a reduction in willpower required to begin the task.

This is clearly great news since it means a task which requires significant willpower

The key insight from the video is that by merely thinking about actions  we are able to strengthen the associated neural pathways from their beginnings in the prefrontal cortex all the way to their destination in the peripheral nervous system. If this is true for motor programs like playing piano and finger exercises, or sitting down to study? In the same way that actually triggering the selection of a motor program in the basal ganglia and performing a particular behavior causes neural pathways to be strengthened, I posit that merely thinking about performing the behavior has the same effect, (albeit to a lesser degree as the video indicated) ultimately reducing the willpower necessary to perform the behavior.

When we make a plan for what we would like to accomplish in a certain period of time and think through it in order to make it easier to stick to, instead think ""Next I will sit down at my desk and work on chapter 5, numbers 1-20. For each problem I'll try to solve it the best I can, then go back through the chapter and look at examples to see if I was right. If I'm not I'll try to see what I did wrong and fix it before moving on to the next problem."" Vividly visualize walking through the entire plan a few times to increase habituation, the more the better obviously and presumably there will be diminishing returns with each repetition.

I'd like to add two more tid bits of information that I think are useful. First, there are a couple of good apps you can use to track progress when trying to acquire daily habits: ""Habit Streak"" for android and ""Chains"" for iphone. You enter tasks then they track how many days in a row you've completed the task to form a streak/chain. They help by allowing you to compete with yourself to beat your all-time best and by accumulating pressure not to break the chain as it grows and you don't want to throw away your achievement.

This post is a follow up to my previous one in order to be more clear and more practical.

You need to step back and look at the bigger picture. Look at the cycle in its entirety. You look at some element in your life (your money, etc) and think “I don’t like this shit, this shit needs to change now.” And then you come up with a plan to make it go away. Because you can’t do it in a day, you commit to establishing a habit.

Next, before finally slipping up once. When you do, you promise you’ll make it up tomorrow. You do or you don’t. Either way, the slip ups increase in frequency until the whole project withers and dies. And then a moment comes where you realize what has happened.

You slam yourself back in the other direction, sleeping in, etc. Then that dies down and everything returns to how it was before you started. It stays that what until you begin again.

This is a periodical cycle that we’re all involved in. All of us are at one point or another in this process regarding some aspect of our lives.

**TL;DR: We constantly (valiantly) begin habits that fail.**

This happens again and again and again. What makes some habits stick and not others? What’s the deciding factor?

For one, your dedication, or your heritage.

It’s your degree of acceptance. Acceptance is what makes it or breaks it.

Suppose you’re a smoker. You read about all the terrible things it does to you and you become afraid. You get on yourself to quit. You come up with a plan, just like you did ten times before.

You are afraid. You are looking at your current situation

Whatever you press against will press back. When you press hard

Say you’re way too fat right now. You look at yourself in the mirror and say “No.” Right now

Now all of your admirable effort is expended as wasted energy. It’s just friction. You push and push against your fat, how long you’ve been doing it, how much success you’ve attained. It’s all going to come crashing down eventually.


**TL;DR: If you begin by rejecting things the way they are

Now here’s the ugly part that 9 in 10 people who read this will reject.

If you want to create lasting change

Any action born of rejection will bear no desirable fruit.

Instead, I could still find a way to be happy.”? 

If you try those phrases out

Instead, and enough time to take care of itself?

Because if you can, but now your actions will come from a new place. There will be no desperation behind it. It will be much more productive and sustainable.

If you can truly accept everything as it is, then, really, the problem will take care of itself.

**TL;DR: Acceptance is the missing element in all failed attempts at discipline. You will not attain your desires by rejecting your present moment. If you can chill out

1369663758.0,1f4yam,Slow and Steady wins the race: How to use SMART goals to become more disciplined,bitsnbobs,174,28,15,"**TL;DR:**  It is easy to be impatient and want to achieve a goal rapidly but this requires setting large ambitious targets which require unsustainable amounts of willpower to meet.  In the long run it is much more important to be patient and set achievable targets which you consistently meet and allow you to habitualise certain actions.  There is a system of setting these goals called SMART (one explanation http://topachievement.com/smart.html) which outlines the how to set effective goals.  Aesop's fable about the tortoise and hare is what all of us should be aiming for!  I'm glad they teach that in school but I wish I had truly realised what it meant...be patient and play the long game.  I realise all of this might be obvious to you guys but then again maybe it isn't because it wasn't to me - I kept failing because my targets were too big.  Keep shrinking your targets into you have a 100% sucesss rate - then gradually build them up.  Good luck!

 
**My story:**


It is becoming common knowledge now (at least on here!) that your willpower at a particular point in time is a finite resource
From my experience slow and steady wins every time.  I posted a while ago about my experiences in academia (http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/11ial7/selfdiscipline_matters_more_than_iq_for_academic/)and how the people who got the top marks every time were the people who were the most consistent with working.

A while ago I set two goals – one was to learn the 3000 most commonly used Spanish words and the other was to get fit and lose 20 lbs.  I have been tracking my weight using an app called libra which plots a trend line of your measurements and calculates stats about past and predicted weight loss.  By the way I would really recommend using an app if you are losing weight because it allows you to make so good inferences about what walks and what doesn’t.  My graph shows that I lost a lot during some small periods but for the most part I just stayed constant.  The trouble was that I was setting goals of losing 2-3 lbs a week but that over time this required too much discipline and eventually I would burn out.  Even though I was happy with my weight loss  Libra told me I had only averaged 0.5 lbs a week over the whole time.  I realised that if I had just made a simple commitment of losing 1lb a week I would have doubled my weight loss theoretically by now.  1 lb a week is a fairly easy target and would only require me to create a deficit of 500 cals a day which could be done by reducing 250 from diet and the rest with a relaxing walk in the evening for an hour – hardly a large commitment!  I’ve been doing this for a few weeks no and I’ve lost 4 lbs which might not seem a lot but it required basically no effort at all – just a simple habit.

The other goal I faced a similar problem.  Spanish is very similar to English and I found that I could learn about 100 new words a day, like with the weight loss, even though I’m making slower progress it requires very little effort and has become a habit for me now just to get up and learn those words.

The basic principle behind all of this is how you set your goals and there is a well known system behind successful goal setting called SMART:  Specific, Relevant, Time-bound.  By making your goals achievable the compound effect will be much greater because you won’t burn out.  Furthermore, research has shown that since habits are executed on autopilot they don’t require self-control, and since SMART targets are easier to meet they become habitualised easier, leaving willpower left over for you to allocate to forming new habits!",,,,

I also did some more fun formatting with colors and stuff.

**Time**

I have no specific time of day to do the daily goals listed in row A because I have a very open schedule

**Just Do It**

I really hate to be boring, to stretch out my body, to take my time in the morning"" and so on.

**Enlightenment**

I am trying to learn not to move towards goals, is a lot more important than the past or future.  Brad Warner talks about this in his book Hardcore Zen and I studied a little bit of it in a philosophy class.  The lesson is that the past creates who you are now, and the future is created by who you are now.  Therefore, by enjoying and focusing on the present is a state of enlightenment.  Well, maybe that's not exact, but that is my interpretation of it.  So please be here, now.

**Honesty**

I like to be an honest person and I do hope everyone wants to be honest as well.  Something that is core to trying to be an honest person is being honest with myself.  I don't think there is any better way of knowing that you have a good relationship with yourself without honesty.  If I eat two skittles, ""what am I gaining from lying?""  In reality, I am gaining an unhealthy habit.  So I stop.

**Injury**

I have been trying to work through some of my goals with a lower back muscle pulled.  It does hurt, but with this strain I had to sit in childs pose and stretch a little that way.  I did hate being immobile but if I tried to push it I would just hurt myself more.  Another motivation is that if I cannot do one task, why not do a little more of another?  Reading the books that sit on my shelf due to school, or my reading-intense English major, is one of my summer goals.  I can just pick up and read double or triple my daily goal on a day I cannot workout or do not have access to the tools I need for another goal.

**Travel

One reason for a break from goals is injury.  I didn't worry about my goals while I had this back muscle injury and I realize it is stupid to worry about my goals through any health issue that comes up.  I would say that this includes the passing of loved ones and your mourning, but still strive to do what I can.  If I think an off schedule is going to really throw off my groove, I try really hard to keep going with the goal in some way.  But I really don't want to worry about changing things for a little while unless it might screw with my motivation to complete goals.

**Lead to Happiness**

If a goal doesn't lead me to happiness

**""The secrets to life are hidden behind the word cliché.**

*  *Now* is the time.
*  Today is the first day of the rest of my life.
*  Happiness is a choice.

I live by these cliché ideas and I do believe in them.  Yeah

It's become so habitual and ingrained in my mind that I literally cannot stop going on, especially my siblings

It started from playing online games, and now it's become my whole life. I do everything on the internet and simply never turn it off. Everything revolves around the internet for me. I believe this addiction is ruining my life. I have tried so many things to quit, but I simply don't have the discipline to quit. Literally for the past 6-9 months of my life, I have thought about quitting 3-4 times a week, but I never have.

I've been trying to abstain from using the computer/internet altogether, so I can't do my studying without it, and therefore I become too tempted to surf or do something else. I just want to be able to overcome the addiction completely, and then be able to start using the computer/internet moderately and with control. 

This is one of the hardest obstacles that I have ever tried to overcome in my life

I am here because I have no where else to go. I have tried everything

1363477305.0,1afp4x,Please help. I'm letting my life just fall apart and I don't know why. ,,146,23,64,"I need advice.

I’m married with two children and am currently earning my professional doctorate.  I have three school semesters (including the present one) left before graduation.  I am one of the lucky few who have a coveted, dream-job lined up. But there’s a problem.

I was offered this job this past August. To get such an offer I put forth a gargantuan effort that completely exhausted me: many flights, I returned to school and told myself, “I need a break.”

First I took one weekend off, then I never studied, then I bombed the semester. Luckily, I became very ill around exams. I would have failed anyways, but since I had a documented illness I was able to blame my poor performance on my health. My future employer bought it and I still have the dream job lined up.

However

* Decide I want to play chess. Spend 10 hours researching chess books and order $400 worth of chess books off Amazon.

* Spend 3 days planning a healthy diet and starting P90x. 

* Spend a week ripping 90+ cds to FLAC.

* Watch all 13 seasons of King of the Hill in 8 days. 

* Read “Getting Things Done

* Spend 20 hours straight on Reddit.

* Make 50 servings of soup and freeze it.

A week ago I realized if I didn't pull my shit together I was going to fail this semester and lose my job offer. This would completely derail my life. [edit: we'd probably lose our house, and move back in w/ family]. I told my wife that she had to take the kids and go to her parents so I could power through all this work and get my shit together. She’s a great person, said she understood, took the kids and left me alone three days ago.

Since then I've done nothing. I just keep doing unimportant shit and cannot start working. I’m in a rut and just cannot get out. This has lasted 8 months. I need help. I need to start working but I cannot. This has never happened to me before; I've always been a hard worker. What can I do to get my shit together?

**[edit:] This is the first time I've asked for help. I feel truly lost. I've sent my family away, I'm starting to feel really fucking desperate. I don't know what to do.**

***

**[edit 2:] Last night I made breakfast and coffee and put it in the fridge so I would be ready to start in the morning. I had planned to get up at 6am, here, about writing out my goals. I also thought about neolduser's comment:**

&gt;A true sense of your self-worth. A true and lasting motivation will not come from within yourself. It will come from your relationships with your family, if you are religious, with God. Further focusing on yourself, beating yourself up for your flaws, trying to pump yourself up because of your potential and past accomplishments, and other inward facing tactics will, in my experience, they do not define you. You should also probably seek professional help

**This may sound dumb

&gt; ""You will get up, and finish a cup of coffee. Afterward, when you're ready, you will walk over to the picture, think about your family, and put on your slippers. Once you put on your slippers you will turn on Tannhauser (a 200 min. opera recording) and study without moving until the opera is over. If you do can do just that, for your family

**I just finished my coffee and cleared off my desk. I've set a timer for 45 min. so I can have some time to clean up this room. Once the timer goes off. I'm going to look at the picture, and do work for the first time in 8 months. See you guys on the other side.**

In these studies, etc.) provided immediately or two small rewards if he or she waited until the experimenter returned (after an absence of approximately 15 minutes).

1370970685.0,1g4s2w,Cutting your losses.,,127,18,24,"I'm not sure if this belongs here

Looking back during those days I would spend playing a competitive  online game for... the entire day, I knew that I spent the prior day, week, and month doing almost nothing but gaming, and I knew that today would be yet another wasted day. I didn't like gaming every day and wasting my time being competitive at something that was totally useless, but I continued doing it anyway. Why?

There are of course going to be multiple reasons, I've already wasted almost all my time, so what's the point? I might as well waste another day."" It sounds ridiculous when you clearly articulate it, but that was essentially my excuse. That was my excuse for procrastination, and putting things off for yet another day. 

This thought pattern was so deeply embedded that I extended it to my entire life, and my low self-esteem caused me to think to myself, ""Well, I've fucked up too hard already and wasted so much time, what's the point? I don't even think I'm capable of doing X anyway, it's too tiring, and it would take months

I know this analogy isn't 100% (and I know a gambling addiction is more serious), moments of exciting gratification, but toward the end of the day, he would start losing. But rather than cutting his losses, he says to himself, ""Well, fuck it, might as well keep going.""

Every day, ""I hate it, but every day I tell myself maybe it will be different this time even though I know it's unlikely. I've already lost tens of thousands of dollars. What's another $1000? It doesn't matter anymore. Even if I tried to invest the money somewhere else, it's too hard, and it would take too long. I'm not even good at investing, I'd probably lose it anyway no matter what I did. The small wins are exciting, every day, I get so caught up in the action that I forget everything for just a little while longer.""

This is bullshit self-deception though. Not only is it obvious that the odds are against winning over the long-term, why would that justify gambling another $1000 away? 

In fact, this makes $1000 even more important. If you justify losing money with prior lost money, the cycle will never stop, you will simply lose money until you're dead. 

It's similar to the way I was spending my days. Instead of waking up with money, I just caved and said, ""Fuck it, what's the point, changing is too hard. My friends are moving on with their lives and becoming adults and starting to forget about me, and I'm just sitting here masturbating. It's too late to change anything. I don't even have it in me.

*Even though it was originally written about fapping

&gt;""The key to stopping this behavior is understanding the root causes of it. There seems to be a mantra on this board that basically tells you ""just don't fap""

&gt;It took me about 5 months to realize what I was doing wrong, there is something underneath this behavior. When the cravings come up, it is a sign that your body is getting out of balance...your brain has been using procrastinating as a way to shift emotions. It has been using this behavior as a way to bring equilibrium in your body. **In essence, your brain has been using procrastination as a drug to escape reality and forget / cope with the stresses of your every day life.** 

&gt;So how can you beat it? Well its quite simple really. You just have to make your life worthwhile without this behavior in it. You have to fall in love with the person that you become when you don't procrastinate. In essence, not just stop a behavior. The behavior is clearly meeting needs that aren't being met somewhere in your life. Once you find those needs and start fulfilling them in healthy ways, you'll realize that you never needed this behavior to begin with. 

&gt;I'll give you an example from my life: I used to be a very sedimentary person, I have managed to drastically change my life. I started to exercise, I started reading more, started going on daily long walks, started to eat better (no more junk food), I stopped watching tv and movies so often. I started to study harder, etc. 

&gt;**I did not realize it until recently

&gt;The recovery process is two fold (with a ton of in between steps but you'll figure those out if you do this): 

&gt;Step one is to make your life worth living, and for that, you really have to love your life. The more you enrich your outside life, the more ammo you'll have against the cravings. 

&gt;Another thing you can do is create affirmations. These are short positive statements that you read outloud to yourself every morning and every evening...in the form of ""I am..."". An example would be ""I am proud of my accomplishments"". You can mention your relationship with god in these as well. You might think of it as a pile of nonsense

&gt;Once again

&gt;Step two: Once you get to a place where you really love your life, and that is not where you want to be when your cravings are beating you to a pulp. Stress will make the choice between choosing life and this behavior a lot harder to make. My solution to this problem: Handle your business quickly. Don't leave stuff till the last minute. Get the work out of the way as fast as you can. Make it your first priority, not your last. **Get the stress out of the way so that you can leave room to do the things you love to do. The things that you've fallen in love with. Then the choice becomes ""living a fulfilling life, or escaping"", and you will find that making that choice is significantly easier.** 

&gt;In my personal life, and so now I have dug a hole for myself that I am trying desperately to get out of. If I can get my stress back on track, then this will become easier. The reason why I relapsed most recently was because I left myself the choice between doing difficult mathematics for 7 hours, and escaping reality. As you can see, for an addict, it is very difficult to get out of this choice without caving, especially when you have bad cravings.

1369604892.0,1f3omk,My exam advice for learning essays and derivations whilst an undergraduate,,112,14,7,"Hi r/getdisciplined

I've just done two very tough exams

The two modules were very different and required a lot of learning, we were supposed to do essays on the topics, include extra reading and show, in short that we understood the topics. I think that a good method for learning for this style of exam may be important to many on r/getdisciplined. So here's my advice.

My style of learning was to prepare answers that would do well and then learn those. Below are my tips for 1. creating the answers

**1. Answer creation:**

**1a**. *Speak to your colleagues.* Class mates are best and speak to more than one. Once you find out what everyone else is doing you will realise that one

**1b**. *Go through the lecture notes.* Your lecture notes are meant to guide you

**1c**. *Question spotting.* Find which questions have come up before. Write down all of these questions and ADD any questions of a similar style that could occur from your lecture notes. When adding questions make sure to be as broad as possible within the framework the lecturer has provided. Look at exercise questions that have been set by your lecturer and compare these to previous exam questions

**1d**. *Read around the topic.* To get a good answer for your topic you need to show some extra reading. This may come in the form of academic journals or books/online resources. When reading academic journals focus on the abstract

**1e**. *Plan for each possible question within allocated time* Following from 1c: exams have a set layout that a lecturer will tell you before it comes up. Work out how long you have for each section then.

**1f**. **Structure.** *Structure* This is to be combined with your planning. Each essay should have a structure and one that you can relate to quickly. Being dyslexic I find this tough to do. My method is to initially brainstorm points and then, I had to write a literature review on a certain topic. I brainstormed all papers that I could think of and some important points. I then wrote the papers in chronological order, this made sense as each built on the next though an order which works for your essay is what you desire. I then came up with the recurrent METHOD, FINDINGS, WEAKNESSES/ANALYSIS way of breaking each paper down. 
Now this method must change slightly when you don’t know what question will come up. It is key here to make your answer flexible enough to cut out waffle when asked a specific question. For instance: say I had a question explain the Economics of Labour demand

**1g. Colour**
I think this is the most important thing I could recommend along with timing. Buy 10 felt tip pens all of different colours and a stack of A3 (it’l be the best money you spend). Make sure you have bright visible colours that are distinguishable from each other and black.
Now say you have 4 topics to learn, orange = 3 brown =4. On top of that I use Green as difficult to remember, pink as vital, and Black (and black only for this) as the journal author and year of publication. I then construct my answers in their major colour, but bracket each title, sub title in a green cloud and extend a line from it to the bottom of that subsection (then repeat cloud). Big subsections have a big green square and prongs on the outer side of them. I can see nearly all of my notes when I’m in an exam through this method of learning.
If you have graphs then draw the graph axis in its section’s colour. 
Also, as is the persistence change section.


**2. Learning answers:**

**2a**. *Timed Answer* Firstly write your answer using the same equipment you’d use in your exam but looking at your coloured notes whilst timing the answer with a stopwatch. You’ll see very quickly whether you need to cut things or not. If you do need to cut things do so

**2b**. *Record answer* on your phone or on a recording device record yourself

**2c**. *Re-write answer 5 times* The first time you do this look at your notes for 10mins before
For number 4

**2d** *Difficulty with a specific point* If you cannot remember something then use the **look say cover write check technique**. Do it in that order and repeat until you get it

----------------------------
And that should be enough. I’ve found that with the above


I hope some of it is useful.

TL;DR
Read the italics and look at what you think is appropriate for you. Focus on **communicating with others

Edit: Final point, but always remember any 'I can't do it' attitude is never 100% correct. To relieve stress I cut caffeine from my diet completely, even green tea. I meditated for 15-30mins every morning see here: http://www.audiodharma.org/series/1/talk/1835/ and I always ate decent quality food (cut anything that would spike my day but end in a low ie fast food).

Work on yourself. 

Work on your vision. 

As you change people who have known you for a while will make fun of you. They will try to stop you. They are threatened by your transforming into a different person. That is too bad. You stick with your vision of what you want to be. Lock onto the idea that you can be that. Be patient. Know that it is coming. When you work out

See what you want, be in alignment with that vision. Do things that are only moving you towards that vision. You can't live in the dream career you want, while holding onto a job you hate. You can't have the ultimate relationship while you are dating someone you don't want. You can't get massively healthy without staying in the alignment of the diet and work out that you want to be. 
Do not focus on the people around you. If you have to focus on anyone


Comprehend this. Know for sure that what you want is possible. If you don't believe it's possible, but don't know how. If you can see how immediately, your vision is too easy. You want a vision that is so exciting, that many different ""How's"" show up continually. 


Be willing to trust and know that the thing you want is doable and HOLD that vision. You will suddenly be shown many different ways to get there. When those ways show up, and now you do. This means there are many many other methods that you can't see right now. Be excited only that the sky is the limit. 


Stay open to more. What you know now is nothing compared to what is possible. Be willing to admit you know very little


Envision the type of person that you want to be and then ask yourself, let go of those things. This spells out to yourself or the universe, or god or whatever you want to call it that you are willing to trust and take a leap of faith. You are proving that you don't need to hold onto the old ways. You are willing to move forward and make new ways. 


You are unlimited. 

Trust this. The second you think ""Yeah right"" you've already lost it. You are infinite


Here is the most important part. Actually do this. If you read this and get inspired and then tomorrow you do what you did today


This isn't just some thing designed to make you happy. It feels good to read


The reason that I write this kind of stuff over and over and over is because I am constantly discovering what a transformation feels like. When people just post positive stuff


Just like this. You have to actually do this if you want the thing. IF you don't do this

This is real. This is not just another positive BS post. 

Show up and prove to yourself that this is real.""

**Background:**

- Got a BS, had fiance cheat on me and I lost my shit. I was suicidal, depressed, and bat shit crazy. I spent 2 years being nothing. Dropped out of school, wasted all of my savings, started being a bartender, and became an mmo addict and alcohol addict. MMO ended about 1.5 years ago. I've given up smoking weed for 2 years, I drink a six pack maybe once a week. I quit the bar industry, and I've had the same living situation

**Finances:** 

I have a job that pays all my bills and allows me $100 a week to spend and $100 week to save. It would be more but gas is fucking expensive, or local restaurants/movies that are within a mile driving distance. I have $1200 saved. I just got 2 additional certifications to be a personal trainer, and applied to 15 positions, having call backs at 7 of them currently. I've already been on 5 interviews, with another later today, and several next week. I was recently designated to be promoted to be full time, meaning most work will be telecommuting, and work from home, $400-500 for gas [fucking sucks

**Problem:**

This morning my roommate of 3 years just told me he's moving out. His work is moving him to another  area. I can't afford to keep this place on my own as it is $1200 a month plus ~$250 bills [less during winter, as it is $750-800, and about $150-200 bills. I just spent $1200 on 2 personal training certs [I passed both and am certified,] $900 on new tires yesterday, and I have $400 car insurance in 10 days. I have no one to co-sign, and my credit is not good enough at this time to. I had asked a friend about 8 months ago if he wants to move in together, but he has saved nothing in 8 months.

Every place I've looked at wants first and last month up front, or at least $1500-2000 at minimum.

**Solutions:**

If I get one of more of these jobs I can maybe swing it. Most of them have me doing 2nd/3rd/4th interviews. One of them has me paying $200 for an additional certification that they will pay back in one year [corporate gym.] One of them has a 2-3 month “internship” process where I don't know if I'll be getting paid. I'll still be able to work my normal job at minimal hours

I can live in my truck, and it's 4 college aged kids. I cannot move in with any family. No one lives within 4 hours of me, and I cannot ask anyone for money. My GF has offered for me to live with her, but I do not want to do that, as I would still have to store all my shit, and it would be the same thing as me living out of my truck, just having a place to store my clothes. She's a student, and has to have her parents help her

I have a Samsung 40'' I can maybe get $400-500 for, the computer I actually need for work, but will obviously do me no good if I'm homeless.

I/we eat out about once a week, but I will be homeless in 48 days if I can't get a strategy and execute it perfectly. 

**Advice:**

I'm at a loss. I'm in crisis mode. I was on a track, volunteering, and spending as little money as possible. I have goals, I follow them, and do the best I can to execute as efficiently as possible.

Does anyone see anything I can do? I don't care about things. I will sell them. I have a few clients I already train a few nights a week as I was trying to build up a business. I've applied to 15 positions. I'm trolling craigslist in my free time for anything I can see. I have a current alcohol certification but I don't want to go back into the bar life

I don't know what to do, and I will be in the red in just a few short weeks. I feel like all of my progress will be undone and I will be homeless. This was supposed to take 10 minutes to write up, but I've wasted almost all of my lunch doing this. 

Strategies?

And when I say ""wasted"" I'm not even talking about time spent watching movies or playing games. When you're doing those things at least you have an objective.

So

To that end I've developed a few key principles that have helped tremendously. One, it's going to go off and knowing that forces me to go to bed earlier rather than say ""fuck it I'll just sleep in"". 

Two, workout, work, write, video, etc. When I finish a task I put an X next to it and go on to my next task.

Three,then month goals. Each week I figure out what I need to accomplish that week to move closer to the month goals. Each day I figure out what goals I need to accomplish that day to reach my week goals.

All of this has lead me to becoming productive as a motherfucker. Today before I went into work at 9am I managed to read, and put together a video to upload this afternoon.

I've been subscribed some time now to his subreddit, I want to explain a few things that people seem to be missing. And I think this applies more to the people who have the lack of discipline effectively harming their (future) lives. 

For me, or simple life things that need to be done. If I can get away with it, I will. Noone is there to stop me from doing otherwise, and people close to me have a hard time understanding.

In the past, do your things as soon as you got time for them, go running or even walking every day. It seems so simple. *Just do it* is what I thought. I felt/feel weak and spineless. People around me don't seem to deal with as heavy as I am, so that really makes you feel you are just being a baby about it. 

All right. Stop that.

You lack discipline. It *is* a serious matter. In some if not most cases, you won't like it. I know I am not speaking for everyone, but most of you/us will try and not work for it. It's like an addiction. Why be difficult when you can be lazy and not put in effort? It's so much less strain on your brain! So why fight it?

This is what your brain tells you. You see, warm. You reason your way out of it, despite it being unhealthier, physically and mentally.

The exact same thing is happening with our discipline. We reason with ourselves, you have to fight really damn hard. 

The reason I am telling you all this is because you need to know it won't go away within a few days. Weeks. Even months. You have to think long term. You have to *understand* where the core problem is coming from. Yes, but you just gotta do it. I'm here to get discipline. Other people can do it, so can I. That is all there is to it."" Which is partially true, but not a permanent solution. 

For us people who deal with this severely, you first need to *prioritize*. To realize what the problem is before you can be thinking about a solution. And you need to give it time. Forcing it on yourself to want it within a week or month isn't going to cut it. For some people yes, but not for the people dealing with this heavier then others. 

For example, and someone to (positively) help me and check up on me. Having someone getting angry at you or punish you for not doing what you should is not the right way. You have to start to understand your situation and get yourself used to it. You are here because you want a change.  

Find a loophole

**Expect it to be the hardest thing you have ever done, just do not underestimate it is all I am saying. Try and find the reasons *why* you postpone and procrastinate. In most cases the answer will be more difficult then you think.

1. Its a program that you can blindly follow and see results fairly quickly (60 days) if you are going for fat burn. Insanity isnt big on strength but P90x is. 

2. The quicker results help me keep motivated.

1354955148.0,14hp3l,Tip of the week (#1)- Compartmentalize.,StavromularBeta,95,7,22,"Hey all. 

I figured I'd give doing a weekly tip a try. We are all trying to achieve self discipline in our lives

anyway


**Compartmentalize your life.**

I am a college student (I assume the majority of you guys on here are). For a very long time now, and we have a pretty big library with lots of tables and desks to sit down and study at. The atmosphere is very quiet, and everybody tends to be engrossed in what they are doing.

I have started doing as much of my school work as possible in the library, I am keeping work and play in their own individual compartments, with as little crossover as possible.

I have found there to be a lot of advantages in doing this. I study much more efficiently, and leaves more time for relaxing, and doing the things that I enjoy. When I keep all my work in one specific place, it starts to become habit forming. When I am at the library, I am in work mode. When I try to do work at home, it is always difficult due to the sheer amount of distractions. At the library, there is me, and a wall of silent faces. I tend to not be distracted

This leaves my house as a work free zone

Do you guys agree with this? disagree with this? have you tried it, and if not, can you think of alternatives to obvious places like a library?

The problem is
I pop back and forth from Facebook to Reddit to Amazon to Craigslist to my various fitness sites (ie Fitocracy). But

I am a product manager for a small software company. I should be guiding my development team, I could really improve my income since I get commission on every new sale. I just am NOT motivated. I can't seem to stop surfing.

The company I work for is good in many ways. My boss does not hover or even direct. I am totally left to manage myself. They provide food and all kinds of side benefits. The let me set up a gym and treadmill in the office to support my fitness program. They even let me bring my dog to work. I can come and go as I please. They treat me very well. Why can't I return the favor by doing what I should be doing? It would benefit them and me both. 

What the fuck is wrong with me? How do I get myself on track? I've been in this work rut for years now.

And yes, I found the people most knowledgable about losing weight were fellow fat people.

[EDIT] Thanks everyone for the really great comments and suggestions. Boiling it down to a 3 things so far.

1- My job doesn't interest or challenge me.
You are correct. It's a rather boring job that just doesn't offer what I really need, I do have a greater than average ability to define what my job really is. SOLUTION: Sit down, create some goals and define my position better so I know what I'm doing and where I'm headed. I really don't want to give up my perks, so I need to make the job interesting. It's in my power to do so.

2- Focus. This is really related to #1, share it!) SOLUTION: Daily to do lists, small rewards for completing tasks and make sure I start out productive instead of using the first hour to coast.

3- Kick my internet habit. I spend too much time, I just may turn to work.

2. I got and maintained a high GPA

Lack of sleep can affect me to the point of suicide idelation. But even knowing that, I can't seem to get into the habit of sleeping early.

* 2. Doing the things I need to do.
Apply for internships, or maybe I'm just lazy. I don't know myself enough to figure this out, and maybe someone with more personal insight can help me.

Also

* 3. Working out and being fit.
I've tried to start this habit several times during high school and college. It just never worked. Fitness is a completely different lifestyle than what I am living right now.

I am posting because I feel worried. Time is passing very fast to me

I lose myself all the time. I burn away all my free time, playing games that consume me. This eats up hours of my day. Hours that I need to use for studying, having a fit lifestyle, going outside and making friends, and making my life not feel like shit anymore (the depression).

I remember during the last few sessions with my therapist (the sessions had to end, and my life. I feel like it's out of control sometimes. I don't like how I need to send my headphones for repair, and I've been putting it off for over 6 months, and if I've done it sooner I could be using them right now. I don't like how I've never had a girlfriend before, or gotten laid, or did anything impressive like all my friends.

It was a pretty good film, but that isn’t the general appeal of him to begin with. He has a baby face and he is as smooth as silk. Considering the period which this movie was shot, although I have a couple of extra layers on me then he ever will I’m sure. But in the excitement of post-cinema dreaming

A few days of mentally going over the images in my head and I became really ashamed of myself.  For all the time I wasted on wanting so badly to have something, I found that a good number of other people do the exact same thing. At least once a day, I can find someone who feels they are entitled to something that they don’t deserve.  

Ever since then, and it is so hard not to throw everything out and go to Mcdonald’s and get a double quarter pounder and a large fry and just gorge myself until I’m “happy.” It’s been a real struggle to ignore the pangs that say ‘sleep in’ or ‘we’ll do that tomorrow’.  Tomorrow only comes because the world makes it. I have still yet to convince myself that I will never look the way I feel that I deserve if I don’t get in there and actually deserve it.    

Entitlement is an epidemic. It stops people from acting like human beings in the face of adversity, not given away. The things that matter in life are this way, why isn’t everything? Maybe there are a lot of things in the world that just don’t matter. I know I can say that there are things that I have lost interest in because they just aren’t necessary anymore. It’s hard to not feel entitlement. It has become the American way of life, but I think that it’s necessary if we ever hope to transcend into something that we can truly be proud of. I know I still feel entitled today, but not as much as I did when I walked from the theater a few weeks ago. I still want to look as good as Ryan Gosling, and hopefully, with a lot of hours of work, I will know that I have earned it. That is a feeling that entitlement can never replicate.

So, we make progress, so each day we can be a better version of ourselves than the previous day. But how do we stop identifying with the former, inferior versions of ourselves?

Let me get more specific. As a kid

I'm 21 now, but I'm pretty muscular. I also did boxing and kickboxing for a while, so I can handle myself. Now here's what happened earlier today. I was going grocery shopping to a shop 5 minutes away from where I live(different neighbourhood than when I was a kid, but way worse). I stop at the ATM, get my money out, and just as I was about to head towards the shop a guy come up to me and says something like: hey man do u wanna buy a watch? He pulls out a fake rolex and says that he can make me a good deal. I say I'm not interested. The guy keeps following me asking if I got any friends who want to buy a watch. I say no. He asks me if I got a cigarette. I say no. Just as I'm about to enter the shop, he asks me if I can give him some money. Again, but I kept going. Now, I was afraid. This version of myself knew that I could take him

So I go into the store and buy my food. On the way home, put the food in the fridge and go back on the street to find the guy. I looked for him for half an hour... while fantasizing about his ribs cracking against my knuckles. About grabbing him by the neck and punch him and punch him and punch him and not stop until I see some blood. Unfortunately, I didn't find him.

1364128748.0,1awssj,The road so far: some of the changes I've made in my life,Vuril,79,5,14,"Hi guys
Over the last weeks I've made some significant changes in my life, I can also inspire or help some of you guys who are struggling with the same things I've struggled with and still am.

I've been struggling with myself and my habits for a long, did volleyball 2x/week, hanging out with friends every now and then. However, every spare moment I would spend on the computer: mostly playing videogames, but also fair amounts of watching series or browsing the internet. I guess I can be happy that MMORPGs don't really appeal to me, I'm mostly a single-player gamer, constantly downloading new games
For a couple years, but there were still times I didn't need to play at all. During the holidays, when I didn't have a laptop with me, I could read books whole days without any urge whatsoever. And when I was busy with other things or had a deadline coming, I had days that I didn't play and didn't miss it.  
However, the thing I did whenever I didn't have anything to do at that moment. And I started procrastinating; I think I have an instinct for guessing how much time I need for certain tasks, so I would procrastinate up to the moment I had just enough time to finish it (though never enough to actually satisfy the perfectionist I do have in me). I started skirting the edge more and more, spending less time on my study, but I still got very high grades, so I didn't have any extra motivation there to change my ways.  
Of course I had nagging parents that kept saying every once in a while that I needed to stop procrastinating and that I was addicted to the computer. However, I did see it myself, but I couldn't talk to them about it; I thought they wouldn't understand; it felt too painful admitting I had a problem to them; I wanted to fix this myself and didn't want to rely on other people.  
After this had been going on for a couple years, but always ended up back where I was before.

Until some months ago
I started with an internship, I was very tired, mentally and physically. I had to find new ways to reload and relax and didn't have time any more to waste it on things I didn't need.  
Because of this change, but I also saw why I still had to do them.  
- It was my way of coping with negative emotions or feelings. When I was playing a game or watching some series
- It was just easier; most of the things I wanted to do instead
- I used the gaming to fill a void; whenever I had a spare moment, it always felt like I achieved something.   

But I realized these weren't true:   
	- It might give me instant gratification, if I would study or do other important stuff, I would feel genuinely good about myself and like I've accomplished something that day.  
	- Procrastinating didn't solve my negative emotions or make them disappear, keeping the system going.  
	- Because it can only cause more negativity, connections with real people. Perhaps it's like throwing acid in a deep hole; it seems like you're filling it with something, but all it does is burn and make it deeper.

Over the years
- Meditation. For my birthday, but I'm glad I persisted. In the moment, it can be very relaxing, just focusing on your breath or body and to leave all your worries for some time. But in the long term, I noticed some other very big changes. I became much more aware of my thoughts and my urges, which is indispensable when you want to change and do what you need or want to do. And I also started noticing the world again: flocks of birds flying through the sky, the snow on my way to work, and found my senses back. This was very important for me
	- A diary. More than 3 years ago, write by longhand for three pages, whatever is on your mind). I followed that a couple months and it helped me enormously in creating quietness in my mind, by getting all the random thoughts out of my head and allowing me to actually think them through. Since then I've failed at this habit many times because I simply forgot or got busy, but I also kept starting again because I found it's so valuable. I've written in different formats (writing longhand,  Word, 750words.com, they have all their own strengths
	- Most Important Tasks (MIT). This is a concept I've learned from Zenhabits: every morning (or evening before you go to bed, even if it's just for 1 minute, before you start with anything else. Everyone can do that right? But by actually starting, you're making a start at beating your procrastination, and from there you can expand. Right now, I pick one or a few tasks every day, that I know I can complete. If I've done those, it doesn't matter
	- [Beeminder](http://beeminder.com). This is the one thing that has been the basis for all the other changes to succeed. Without this, so you can make it as hard or as easy as you want. The changes will only go into effect 7 days from now though, so that you can't weasel out of your commitment in the short term. It has integrations with various different services (GitHub, Withings, Trello, RescueTime, Gmail) and you can schedule daily reminders to mail or SMS if you want to. Their business model is that you commit to pay for their service if you derail from your goal (the first one is free, as long as you stay on your road, started exercising more often and reduced my email inbox to zero from 1500+ emails). By starting slowly and with the extra motivation and accountability, and they helped me a couple times when I had problems).  
	- [Trello](http://trello.com): here, and from there I can then drag them to my Done list, which keeps growing and growing. I have even set up a goal in Beeminder, to automatically keep track the amount of MITs I completed.  
	- Change your unproductive routines. Every morning, and adding in a short meditation), I already start the day with a more productive mind-set and the need for the internet fades away.   
	- Organise the bookmarks for websites you visit frequently in folders. I used to spend much time checking some sites again and again (e.g. Facebook, Feedly, Youtube, news sites). I realized some sites are very important for me (Trello, Beeminder, my online diary), so I put those together in one folder. By organising a few of the other sites in another folder (Gmail, Feedly), I can create some moments during the day that I allow myself to check those sites

A very important thing I've found: don't try to change too much all at once. Most diets fail because the people didn't make any lasting changes in their life, maybe a few weeks or months, but you'll probably end up just like with a regular diet: back at square one.   
Instead, something not too big or too hard, that you know you can do. If you managed to keep that habit going, maybe try expanding it a little more after 1-2 weeks. And then maybe try adding another habit, and another after that, just try to keep improving yourself. Maybe you won't see the results as quickly, but in this way you'll actually have a chance to succeed. And as long as you keep moving forward, if you actually took the time to change and didn't try to rush it and fail miserably.

All this isn't to say that I'm perfect or anything. A couple weeks back I realized I hadn't actually played any games for some time and I realized I hadn't really missed it; in fact, so I'm still struggling with Facebook or Reddit or watching series every now and then (and I have to admit I have played some games for a short time again), especially if I'm experiencing stress from something. However, I feel I have built a framework by now that keeps me on track and allows me to intervene if I'm going back hill again.

Well
If you've read all that (or some of it)
And if you have questions or comments


Tl;dr: don't try to change too much all at once, picking a task to do every day, Beeminder and Trello.

What will you regret more

What will you regret more

My desk job is killing me, in theory, I have a creative job, they aren't my ideas, my aesthetic). I decided a year or two ago that my life purpose was to make things and yet food is the only thing I have been making. I have all these dreams of making things and yet I go home and barely do anything. We watch movies together, and that's our together time? That isn't good enough. I want to see sunsets together. I want to stay in shape together so we can live our lives together for a long time. I want to paint, build, design and then MAKE IT. Ideas that stay in a notebook do nothing to change the world. Creativity is like anger

I make a lot of excuses, or I'm tired. This is bull shit. Limitations are the birthplace of creativity, so stop fucking fighting it or you really are a lazy person who gave up after a good run at college. No better than the high school quarterback who is still stuck in high school, you still dream of college where you did well in your classes, but now this is the real world. You have to work and that's never going to actually pay the bills and tap all your creativity. At least not yet. Stop lying to yourself that you are a certain kind of person, when, if you look at how you spend your day YOU ARE NOT BEING THE BEST YOU CAN BE. 

I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired OF MYSELF. I make lots of plans of wanting to do something but don't always do it, that's the answer.

My boss already told me that one thing they look for in moving up is involvement in the community

Ugh

1) Get out of my credit card debt. I'll achieve this by:
*Making my own lunches every day
* Walking to and from the office every day instead of taking the bus
*No non essential clothes shopping (I'm saying non essential because I'm quite sporty and it might be I need some new sports clothes. Anything that's just trendy or fashion shopping is out)
*Buying my travel cards on a monthly basis instead of weekly 


2) Do Cardio 5 times a week. This can be either:
*Running
*Cycling
*Workout DVD


3)Read for an hour every day


4) Set my alarm for 5:45 every day and do not hit snooze. This will probably be the hardest because I am terrible and not hitting the snooze button. I want to be able to use the time in the morning to get my day organised, have a tidy in the flat.  This will also mean I have to go to bed earlier since I still would want to get my 7/8 hours sleep. 


5) Draw

6)No soft drinks (soda) or Crisps (chips)

7) 20 minutes cleaning every day. Either at home or at work. (Doesn't include laundry or loading/unloading the dish washer)


I'm hoping that by October these habits will be second nature to me and I'll be able to do them without even thinking about it.

Many moons ago there lived a young warrior in a small mining village. He
dreamed of marrying the Chief’s daughter. Her beauty was legend across the
mountain villages.


Each year during the Spring Solstice the Chief would hold a banquet in her
honor and allow suitors to vie for her hand. And each year the great
warrior suitors would leave the banquet disappointed and confounded. For
the task which the Chief put them to was an impossible task. How does one
eat an Elephant?

Great warriors from across the land again gathered during the spring
solstice. The enormous pile of roast elephant sat all but ignored in favor
of more exotic delicacies as all the warriors had given up on the Chief’s
challenge many moons ago.

As the night wore on the Chief noticed that a young warrior had seated
himself next to the enormous pile of roast Elephant and was taking steady
determined bites. The dancing started
old men and women returned to their huts and still the young warrior ate.
The moon crossed the night sky and still the young warrior ate.

The next morning the Chief saw that the young warrior still sat at his
post
night the pile of roast Elephant looked unchanged in size.

The aftermath of the banquet was cleared during the day and still the
young warrior continued eating. The Chief ordered that the roast Elephant
be left for the young warrior.

The young warrior ate through the day and the second night.

The next morning the Chief called for all of his villagers to gather around
the roast. “My good villagers
deep and resonate voice. “Today my daughter marries!”

The crowd hushed. “But no one ate the Elephant”
slightly intoxicated villager.

The Chief
warrior who was still diligently attacking the roast. “Stand young warrior
and tell me: how do you eat an Elephant?”

The young warrior stood. His stomach visibly engorged. He took a deep
breath and then said in a proud and calm voice
time.”

“My dear villagers
entire Elephant. I was looking for a special warrior who had the grit and
determination to tackle any problem
who would never quit once he set his heart upon a goal. And today I have
found that warrior”

——————————————————————————————–

I wrote this story to help illustrate for you one of life’s most important
lessons. Every task
And with that attitude nothing in life is impossible.

Think about your health goal. Is it daunting to imagine all of the workouts
and nutrition changes you’ll have to make over your lifetime to reach your
ideal body? But what if you stopped focusing on the total task and instead
look at the very next bite. What is the one thing you must do today that
will bring you one step closer to your end goal? How difficult is it to go
to the gym ONCE? How difficult is it to eat well

We can only ever do one thing at a time. Remember that. And then let the
stress of all future events slide off of your shoulders. We will all reach
our goals

Take care and have a wonderful day

One night I thought I was never going to make it and I was planning on postponing my exam. I went on the Pre-med subreddit asking for advice and some guy was like

It was about 1:00am when this happened and I couldn't sleep because I was so angry

I then did something I've never done before, so I decided to channel all I was feelings into a letter to myself, since I knew that the inspiration I was feeling would be gone by the morning.

I took to a Word document and in about five minutes was 3 pages deep into a letter that I poured my feelings into. I told myself about how years of failures and weak attempts had lead to this point and that I could reverse it all by acing this exam. I outlined how all I want at this point in my life is to get into med school and that the only person standing in my way was myself. I urged myself that nothing was worth not doing the work I needed to do and that although everyone I know has said that med school is a pipe dream for me

I ended off that letter stating that 42 days separated me and the MCAT that could more or less decide the rest of my life and that how I chose to spend those 42 days was up to me. I saved the file as a PDF and put it on every single one of my electronic devices; my phone, everything.

Every day since then I wake up and read that letter to myself and it reminds me exactly how I felt that night when some stranger on the Internet told me I wasn't good enough to meet the goal I set for myself and I remember all the feelings I had when he told me this. That sets up my day to use it to its full potential and whenever I have any doubts in myself I just go back and read that letter I wrote to myself and all my doubts quickly go away.

I write my MCAT on August 28th and I plan on reading that letter over 100 more times between now and then in order to ensure my success.

I encourage anyone else struggling to reach a goal to do the same thing and write down their mantra with their motivations and goals and then read it every single time they feel like they won't get the job done. I promise you nothing is more satisfying than remembering why you're doing what you're doing. If I end up getting the score I want on the MCAT

1370933271.0,1g3u6e,A Theory About Success and How to Achieve It,WAMF,80,17,28,"OK

Becoming successful is a war of attrition which can take years to win:

Lets pretend that “success” can be a purely-objective quality that describes your overall life

-	Overall attitude, etc

-	Health/Fitness level

-	Having meaningful friendships/relationships (quality over quantity here)

-	Financial stability/security and economic freedom (not to be confused with wealth)

-	Overall intelligence/knowledge

Now, according to the criteria listed above.  Even if you enter this world under the best of circumstances (wealthy family, no genetic problems, good parents, high IQ, etc), you are not going to be successful without striving to be the best person you can be.  For example, this won’t necessarily make you healthy or stress-free.  External factors can only go so far in shaping you; thus it’s ultimately up to you to make yourself happy, and learn to be a better person.
	
Since none of us are born successful, here’s where most people get it wrong:  As soon as we start doing well, we have a tendency to become complacent and stop improving ourselves before we realize our full potential.  As an example, many of the “popular” kids in my high school never really went anywhere in life after graduating.  The “hot girls” and “jocks” mostly just went to mediocre colleges for meaningless degrees, since they had already become content with their status as the “cool kids.”  Unfortunately, it’s not just the top of our adolescent society that burns out, but rather the overwhelming majority.  The middle and lower classes are largely made up of people who haven’t realized their full potential
	

As an alternative to this, I was a nobody.  Even though I was at the top of my class academically, I was scrawny, shy, and had very few people I could call friends.  Most of my free time was spent buried in books, and I was a constant subject of ridicule in the classroom.  However, as I entered into high school, and as much as I love them, I was tired of being unhappy with myself.  My grades had always been good, since it was one of the few sports that you didn’t have to try out for.  Even though I was by far the slowest kid on the team (during freshman year) and it never made me “cool

Now, I have no debt, and I have a guaranteed career (doing awesome stuff, nonetheless) for the forseeable future.  I’ve got a fantastic group of trustworthy friends (both in and out of the military), I’m in the best shape of my life (and still improving), and most importantly, I have eliminated almost all stress from my life by focusing on things that are:

A)	Important

B)	Under my control

…and “tuning out” what isn’t.  Am I perfect?  Of course not.  I’m still embarrassingly awful with women and I can be extremely passive at times

IN CONCLUSION:
What I’ve come to realize is that it’s not really all that important how well you’re doing or who you are, but this is exactly what will doom us to mediocrity.  The way to succeed in our society is to maintain a long-term positive attitude and keep improving yourself and your life even after your peers have peaked and begun to settle down.  

TL;DR:  Slow and steady wins the race

Thoughts and comments would be much appreciated!

I thought I was very smart- I am, and get the GPA required to apply to my choice of university. My math, physics, chem, and bio scores are all perfect. But because I was in a dark place at the time, the state university still rejected me without any reason other than that they didn't like my writing. Now I'm back in my home country with my mom.

I decided to stop searching for reasons- when I would set goals I would tell myself that I had a reason to be anxious so I would worry and it would all go downhill from there. But I realized that even though my uni had rejected me and everything is back to base 1

I told myself ""BE realxed, I am relaxed."" I tricked my mind's obssessive want for reason onto itself. I can't wait or find something or someone to SAVE ME- that's just a figment of my imagination that I had created way into the future- that will NEVER COME BECAUSE THATS NOT HOW IT WORKS. I have to, this instant, BE, thus FEEL, thus KNOW. I repeated this mantra for a couple hours in my head and for the first time in years I feel a sense of difference and see a light at the end of the tunnel.

The next time you do dishes, onto your towel. Dry each plate meticulously, ensuring there isn't a drop of water on anything. Put everything away without making a single sound. It's like therapy. It is amazing how involved you can get into such a ridiculous little thing, and how nice you feel afterwards.

Try to live an entire day perfectly. Wake up, with the total purity of each tiny activity his number one priority, as if nothing else matters.

Ok. Almost two weeks of listening nature wille studying and I have to say that I cannot think in a better way of relaxing and concentrating with sound. Anyways I want to share some things about this subject that I had discovered:

 First, you don't start moving your foot by the rhythm, and you don't think things like ""wow, how good is this bass player ffs!"". There are other benefits that I can get from ""nature music"": the best recordings get you a feeling of deepness and texture, they take you to some other (calm) dimension where you really can focus and, (hopefully) they reproduce a great range of sound frequencies that go trough deeb bass (like storm and waves), mid frequency (like some animal sounds or water flowing) and get till the clear high frequency of the birds song. Some of them even have a permanent white relaxing noise as can be the sound of the rain. This range of frequencies actually give your mind a sort of an all-rounded massage while neutralizing other ambient noises from your working place. The problem I found here was:

- The majority of the free ""nature music"" sources from internet **are not HD stereo recordings**... Unfortunattley many of them are not even recordings! 
- Many are just a **3 minute track repeated 20 times** (that makes you know the recording and
- Other are just **a computer program that generates aleatory nature sounds**. This one makes me feel frustrated, you just have to stop the track.
- Finally some of the real 1h stereo recordings **just don't have the quality you would want** to reach that natural range of frecuencys that would let you enjoy the nature and be so damn relaxed...

With a little more research I found that there's some people (usually sound tech pros or some kind of wild life professionals) that really make an effort to record **real HQ nature stereo recordings** that have a wide range of frequencies and dont repeat a sound for the entire track. THOSE ARE MY HEROES! 
But has any professional good work, and I would be pleased to give you some feedback after listening

Lastly here you have some good links as an example of the job of this quality ""nature music"" recorders

The problem, almost miraculously

If you really want to make a change then start small. Do one thing every day for sixty-six  days (some studies have come out to show this is the time it takes to make something into a habit) that you know you will be able to do. It could be as simple as not eating potato chips or doing light exercise. Heck, make sure to do it diligently and not let up. Start with something stupid and easy but stick to it. Once you get used to being able to do something on a daily basis and actually follow through, you can then pick something a little more challenging to tackle. Now, developing one good habit every sixty-six days may seem slow at the moment, but developing self-discipline is not something that can happen overnight. Some people live their entire lives as slaves to their bad habits whilst searching for a quick and easy solution. Don't look for shortcuts and don't believe the snake oil salesman armed with cute quotes and empty advice. Inspiration is never a substitute for methodical, hard work and patience.

Demon Days by the Gorillaz has been one of my favorite albums since its release in 2005. There have been few constants in my life since then, and listening to the album brings back a number of memories from a good portion of my life. That being said, know so very little about the album. I know a good number of the lyrics, but not enough to understand the messages of the songs.   

The more I listen to this album that I’ve heard a couple of hundred times, I would find similar subtle touches that I haven’t noticed yet.   

That list was made solely for the purpose of me learning more about something that I loved. This, at least none that I can remember now. I can only assume that the list was buried under something more fun or relevant at the time and was ever recovered. There is a folder of such lists on my hard drive. One contains recipes I have meant to find and try. Another a list of piano songs I were to learn once I got a keyboard and learned to play. The keyboard sits under a growing layer of dust in what we call the “junk room” now. My drumset is there as well.  

Somewhere along the line, I have finally found a number of these lists, and I am ashamed that I so many are still relevant and unfinished. I still wish to try to write a list of rules to follow in order to survive a horror movie. I started on that project over 3 years ago and have yet to break a single page.  

I know I am not the only person with this issue. Gym memberships go through the roof during January, if any, and stopped coming altogether. I have worked customer service for the past 4 years, and a good number of people I speak to  simply refuse to take responsibility for their actions. There I so little accountability in our personal lives that these slack standards have made their way into our public lives.  

We, it is an easy task to assign something that is more important ahead of something that seems trivial. I will admit, my financial stability and safety is not dependent on me writing a book making fun or horror movies. That isn’t the point. I said I was going to do something and I haven’t done it. We all do this, every day.  

The new year is only ten days old, someone has given up on a resolution or a goal they have set for themselves. It certainly is hard to lose weight. It’s hard to trade bad habits that make our lives convenient for good ones that will, in time, enrich our lives. Among all the goals on many people’s list this year, they have all forgotten the most important goal: Be more accountable for your actions. Even a little progress on this one goal will nurture every other action in your life.

I have lived my life so far without putting all that much effort into anything. Partly it is because I have not needed to, the more I realize that this has caused a lot of fuck ups and has really affected my life.

For example, whatever. But a few years ago I stopped taking the piano lessons I had been taking since I was 6. Not because I don't like it, but because I just wasn't practicing enough. Pieces that I would honestly be able to master in a week if I truly applied myself would take months for me to play them well enough for my teacher to think it was good enough to move on, and I realized that I was just wasting his time. 

In elementary/high school I could easily breeze through anything that I could finish in class

This might just seem like a procrastination problem but it is more than that. Even when I finally 'get down' to dealing with what I need to do it is like my brain just shuts down after a while and then I'm done for the day. It doesn't matter if it is doing something that I really want to do or if it is something I *just* “need” to do. So even after I have pushed through the procrastination itself, and I know the only way to get better at it is to actually draw, but watching tutorials on Youtube of people drawing better than me is a lot less work, so that is what ends up happening.

I'd love to spend literally all day single mindedly focused on doing something

Recently I have been genuinely trying to improve myself, goals, rules, plans, whatever, it just never works because I just ignore them. For example, I had set up a deadline (July 1st) for a personal project I wanted to accomplish that was definitely within my abilities, but only enough to do a fraction I can spend great deals of time thinking about all the things I would do to accomplish it

Yesterday I had 2 goals written down that I wanted to accomplish. One was to spend 0 to 30 minutes on Reddit the whole day (I basically use it as a second Google or Wikipedia, nothing.  That day I woke up with a bad headache that lasted a long time, so obviously I used that as an excuse to not organize. A terrible one, considering it was bearable when sitting still without moving my head, which was all that was required of me in the first place.

I want to lose weight. I need to stop eating bad food but I always convince myself ""Just one more day. Tomorrow, not today, today I should cheat, tomorrow I wont.) 

My parents never explained to me how to find problems in your own life, except for losing weight. 

I don't have patience

I know that if I continue these habits, and with that logic, I turn back into a sloth. 

There was only one time in my life I started to lose weight successfully. I convinced myself that if I lose weight, I could have climbed mountains if I knew there was going to be some dry humping at the top! The drawback was that I fell in love with the dude. The amount of times I had to remind myself not to cheat on my diet was extensive. And I had to remind myself of the rewards of sex constantly for motivation. **Damn it, this worked!** I lost **80 lbs**. Can you guess what happened next? He ended up moving, and I gained all of my weight right back, like a yoyo. 

I realized not to do that again based on two reasons. One, that isn't enough.

I have 3 things on my list for this hour that I HAVE to do by 2:55.  If I finish them early I can just chill out and relax until then.

Starting at 3:00

The point of this exercise is to constantly reevaluate your progress.  By spending 5 minutes every hour to plan out your next 55 minutes

Even when you're playing games or socializing

What I like about this is that it offers you flexibility by giving you time to relax after you've accomplished everything for that hour

The only problem I've experienced so far using this method is when I set goals that are too lofty for myself for that hour.  While it is possible to transfer them over to the next hour

I will post more results about the 55-5 rule as my experiment continues.  I need to move on to the next task on my list now so check back in a bit.

EDIT: so far this rule is working. I was just at class so I couldn't do it for the previous hour

EDIT #2: Another common enemy of these kind of ""timed"" plans are distractions.  I've had quite a few since I started this experiment today, after you deal with your distraction, don't feel pressure or anything!  Just finish the items on your list and wait for the next :55 to begin planning.  Otherwise just relax and chill out.

I'm a 3rd year undergrad student in university and this summer I'm doing research under a professor. The work that I'm doing is not hands-on (it's math so I'm not in a lab, etc.), so I only meet with my professor once a week at most. The work is to be done on my own time, so I get to make my own hours and don't actually have to go into school to do my work. He doesn't care when or where I do the work, just as long as it gets done.

But

I just can't focus or something. I start to read a paper, online shopping, watching tv, or laying in bed. When I'm working and I remember a video I wanna watch or a song I want to download, it's like I have to do it right at that moment. I try to ignore the thought and keep working but I just can't stop thinking about it and have to go do it right then (thus interrupting my work). And these are the days when I actually start to do any work at all - there are some days when I don't even bother looking at the material.

Also likely relevant: I've been depressed for a little over a year. I think that this is relevant in that it is very hard for me to motivate myself to do anything. I also don't handle stress well. When I have too much work piling up or the work seems too hard

So, and I feel guilty about it. I respect and admire my professor so much and a portion of my paycheque comes directly from him… but for whatever reason this is not enough to motivate me to work.

&gt; The best way is always to stop when you are going good and when you know what will happen next. If you do that every day … you will never be stuck. Always stop while you are going good and don’t think about it or worry about it until you start to write the next day. That way your subconscious will work on it all the time. But if you think about it consciously or worry about it you will kill it and your brain will be tired before you start.

Basically when you are forced to leave what you happen to be working on, you will know exactly where to pick back up. Like Hemingway says, your subconscious will know where you left off and it will continue to do some computations. All of the computing your subconscious has done on the task will then percolate up whenever you choose to start that task back up.

1352320639.0,12tehw,I need help getting my life together and I feel stuck,,53,4,19,"Hello

I am 19 years old, I wasn't doing the work, and I was afraid. I was never good at school and college was overwhelming for me.

I believed the reason why I felt overwhelmed is because of other issues. I set goals/needs/wants over my education

I dealt with being overweight practically my whole life, I hated myself, I hated my body, and I blamed everything bad that happened to me around me being overweight. Around 11th grade, I started running with my school and it was very successful, I lost around 60 lbs and I felt great, I even ran a marathon! but after the marathon I hit a slope, I gained almost 20 pounds back and that was around the time I started smoking weed.

Fast forward to the beginning of this year. for roughly 7 months I did nothing but smoke weed with friends and I had to quit, eat and hate myself. I got back on track around the beginning of the summer with running and eating well and I managed to push my weight down to 155 (roughly 8-10 lbs in waterweight) This was because I had my brother pushing me and doing exercises with me, after he stopped doing it with me, I stopped doing it.

Fast forward to today. I weigh 168 lbs, I don't care be really muscular, I want to lose my body fat and I can't seem to keep the motivation because growing up I was never taught discipline, and I feel at a total loss. With all of this pent up in my mind, it is really affecting me and my future, I feel unmotivated towards everything.

 I used to be an avid gamer, and with the desperation in my effort to pass time, I fall back on weed.

The over arching problem I believe I have is I am unable to self discipline myself, but there is no authoritative ruling that would discipline me when I stray off from my goals, I never had that driving force growing up and now that I'm 19, when I mess up, I just tell myself whatever and that i'll do better next time without any repercussions to my actions

All I have been told through life in order to get through this was to ""Just do it"" and I cannot do it that way.

What I'm looking for by making this post:

Advice/steps on how to discipline myself
Someone to talk to about my progress, and when I'm feeling unmotivated, have them motivate me, (Since graduating high-school, all my close friends have moved far away to other schools and I've since lost a daily contact with them :/)

I have a number of personal, practicing guitar, learning to meditate, and reading books. I also intend to cultivate better sleeping habits, and get a solid 8 hours per night. I really thrive on that amount of sleep.

Here's what my average weekday looks like

**8:00-9:00** wake up

**9:00-9:30** breakfast

**9:30-10:00** walk to class

**10:00-2:30** class (4.5 of 10 work hours)

**3:00-6:00** homework/study (7.5 of 10 work hours)

**6:00-7:00** dinner

**7:00-9:30** moar homework (10 hours complete)

**9:30-11:00** I guess this is my free time?

**11:00-12:00** get ready for bed

So, play my guitar, meditate, or just sit still for 2 seconds to recharge. I never step foot off my campus. Also note that I have not had any meaningful interaction with another human.

(not titled)



It’s time to make a commitment to improving yourself.

You’ve been stuck in these pointless cycles for more than long enough.

It’s an off balance way to live.

And stopping and looking

You need the discipline to do things that are good for you.

Avoiding; cowardly immature evasion.

This is the core symptom of your problem. 

The core of the source of that symptom could be that you’re running 
away from something.

What you’re running from is shapeless and still unnamed. 

A day could come where you look far enough inside and face it.

But right now it’s time to stop the bleeding

You know what you need to do.

Or at least you know the direction to go.

The high points when your resolve is limitless.

The low points when life seems a useless exercise; a semi-conscious 
haze with no meaning.

Every second you waste in this malicious

It will wear your will away and with it the years will go too.

The path out is in part learning to concentrate. 

You’re scattered.

A broken mirror image of what you know you could be.

You know how to pick up the pieces.

You know how to become a whole person.

You've tasted what lies at the end

And it is sweet.

And it is worth it.

When I was younger, it was all in my brain already.  I had a 5-page paper on something due in high school and literally typed it with my head craned to the side while watching the Knicks on TV.  I got a 95.  

And then I took my first AP course...okay, but stayed afloat until the AP exam.  3 out of 5.  I kind of got rattled by that experience, but then sort of realized I should probably study better.  

Then AP Physics came around the next year.  The night before the first test I spent an hour the night before doing what I thought was good studying.  I got a 50.  Out of 100 (in fairness, I know, but maybe one of you have something that parallels this experience).  

This spilled over into my habits/interests as well.  Songwriting, but as an adult it's been more regret than satisfaction.

When I was younger I rationalized it by labeling myself as ""slacker,"" and that was from an adjunct professor who clearly was disinterested in teaching and I later learned gave everyone in the class an A.  The momentary happiness I felt when I got that grade evaporated when I talked to classmates about it.

***GET DISCIPLINED FAQ***



Welcome to r/getdisciplined! Please look through the FAQ in case any of your questions have already been answered. Don’t have any questions? Read through it anyway


**What exactly is r/getdisciplined?**

Get Disciplined is a subreddit of similarly-minded people who recognise that there are areas in their lives that need work on, isn't for the grumpy army colonel that yells at soldiers to do more pushups, but instead discipline is simply “Training expected to produce a specific character or pattern of behavior”. And that is simply who we are in this subreddit, a bunch of people that through habit and training are trying to bring about positive change to our lives!

**Okay

Well

However if you do simply just want to build some discipline through some small little “drills”

1. Set and stare at a wall for 10 mns. Don't close your eyes

2. 10 mn rule. If you find yourself with a spare ten minutes

Will add more of these as I come across them

**Why do you guys have a rule about having to post more than just a link in a post?**

Because we care about the quality of the posts in this subreddit. We also want, then please do it at r/GetMotivated!



**Please note as well** : there is no place in this subreddit for cynicism. If you don't agree with someone or something in this subreddit

Why is it so good to control yourself

Perhaps discipline is just a way to survive in this world. I think that this is the only way to look at it. Looking at the top posts, not making enough money to eat, etc. 

For why else would we need discipline? There is no downside to a messy room, we think about the potential problems- a friend unexpectedly comes over, we lose our homework in the mess- and that is why we do it. 

As for getting to a goal of yours, but they have convinced themselves that they cannot be happy until they fit that mold. 

Perhaps we should really look at the structures of our world. The incessant checkpoints we have to meet everyday to continue. Clock in at 7, and yet, it is its greatest enemy. For without time, there would be no need to force ourselves to do something everyday. But there is never enough time to do all that we want to do.

Perhaps some of us do not choose discipline

Maybe we should look at discipline differently- lack of discipline is not because you are a weak man

I want to live my life

That there's a better way to go

And move, produce.  
Put your 4 and a half billion year brain to use  
Eliminate all your distractions and let loose  
I am positive that there is creativity inside of you

That we are all capable of making the world new.

Is watching tv and fuckin around really all you know how to do?  

When we were kids
Turn us into a fighter and light our eyes with fire  
Make us play hard

Are you telling me that the joy was all fake  
That we are all on this earth to just make

Being your own boss seems fun until you realize you still have to get stuff done, or just find yourself doing less than you wish you had, this problem applies to you.

A simple solution is to work in a team that can keep track of each other. This is why startups with multiple founders are more likely to succeed. But many of us don't have easy way to form such a team.

That's where my idea comes in: Form teams of people working on unrelated things. Other people don't need to participate in your work to make sure that you do it. Checking that you did what you said you would is simple. And you can provide the same service back to them.

Having someone to track your productivity

But my issue now is that I have this spare time that I can't fill with anything.

Read *The Demise Of Guys* by Philip Zimbardo and I'm in the process of selling most of my video games (and re-confirmed my unhealthy relationship with porn)

My question, what are some good habits to pick up to fill my time with? Stuff you guys/gals picked up or do currently. I keep my space clean, quit smoking (weed+tobacco), eat relatively well and my lifts have been going up. I want to start running soon, but that's really the only thing on the horizon for me.

I'd like to start a discussion on the lack of accomplishment felt after achieving ones goals. I would also like to include some background info leading up to my current situation. Any feedback would be greatly appreciated, I at least had a chance to vent.

I left school when I was 16 years old. Why I left is a mystery to me now

When I turned 18 I started receiving social welfare and moved into my own place. Most of my friends were taking a year off before going to college so it became a second home for them. I don't think a day went by without some form of partying going on. This is when I started using cocaine

One day when I was 20 years old I had a horrible experience after walking home from a party. I had taken quite a few pills that night along with some cocaine and whiskey and when I got back home I lay down on my bed and began to feel my heartbeat become increasingly erratic and I couldn't breathe well enough to call out for help

I must have passed out because my next memory is waking up the next day and bursting into tears

It has been two years since then and I haven't taken any drugs (including cigarettes) since the day I spoke with my mom. I started eating well

I pushed myself really hard to get this far, where I feel happy, but on those days I can sometimes become distant and dull in the blink of an eye.

That wraps things up. Thank you to anyone who took the time to read this.

I find that in today's society it's really easy to have your attention scattered over many different areas.

Also, education....

Okay... in my opinion

**1. Find out why you procrastinate**

This is a really important step that I think is often under emphasised in alot of ""How to Stop Procrastinating"" posts. If don't know why you procrastinate

In the case of myself, playing video games, reading books etc, basically anything that let met escape my current situation/reality. Even though I did, later on, end up enjoying that school, I had already started forming the habit that whenever I was faced with a situation that I found uncomfortable or stressful, exercise etc...

In my opinion, but nevertheless, find out why you procrastinate!

**2. You have to want it bad enough**

I'm not a big fan, as it isn't real advice at all, so I'm not going to do it.

Personally, like me, procrastinate even by trying to find that perfect pomodoro technique, image, motivational quote, productivity app (the list goes on) that will get them to stop procrastinating &amp; work. However you just end up motivated, at the most, but not enough.

The ONLY thing that I've found works is that I have to want it bad enough. Full stop, but if you dont want it bad enough, you won't find a way and therefore it wont make a single difference! You will just keep on procrastinating!

How do you get to that stage of wanting something bad enough, it's often because I want to eat breakfatst bad enough, before I have to start work. And I want to work, because I badly want to achieve more and more in life.

**Sum it all up**

There are a whole lot of other smaller steps that really do help, you will achieve it. If you don't have the willpower, you won't achieve it.

I had nothing to do that day. We ordered pizza, and generally had a damn good time. And I looked at that drench and thought ""wow, i was a part of that.

**A little about me**

I used to be a subscriber in /r/getmotivated. I really liked the sentiment, this appears to be a more mature, fleshed out version of that place, so I hope there are people here who will appreciate what I have to share here. 

I'll start with a confession: I suffer from what I think is a lack of discipline. I have for at least 7 years, great SAT scores, astoundingly good psych evaluation that landed me in Mensa, and top-of-the-line GREs), so I went many years without the need to learn discipline. Didn't do my homework yet? Do that three hour calculus assignment in the 10 minutes before class and get all of them right. Didn't study for the test? Didn't need to. Always the first one done on examinations of any kind, always able to pull Herculean demonstrations of will out of my ass in order to meet any last minute deadline. 

The problem is that things can't stay like that forever. Life catches up with you. I once read that [intelligence is like a knife](http://maxkle.in/your-high-iq-will-kill-your-startup) in that you can rely on it early on because it's such a huge advantage

I briefly sought counseling in 2005, however, I started to notice that it was harder and harder to keep up. I started omitting reading assignments. When I waited until the last minute to do a paper, I was finding that I could barely finish on time. 

I hit my PhD program two years ago and it felt like I had literally run into a wall. *Everyone* around me seemed more industrious. It was and still is hard to keep up with everything. I started going back for counseling and I'm now on several medications that greatly help my affect and give me a head start on getting my act together

The problem is that *no medication can give you discipline*. No matter what you take, and have breakfast. Nothing can make you do the things you have to do to pay the bills. No substance can force you to form good habits. You have to do all of that on your own. 

How? What is the real root of the problem? How do you fix it?

**The Science**

A short while back

It turns out that willpower might be the singularly most important aspect to human behavior. It's definitely measurable and it's drained by so many things that we never even think about. You think you only exert willpower to make hard decisions? Wrong. Deciding what to watch on Netflix or what to eat for dinner can be just as bad as

Willpower is strongly linked to glucose. Are you hungry? Don't expect to force yourself to the gym, which leads to lower glucose, which lowers your willpower, which lowers the chances that you'll adhere to your diet. 

The environment, your brain is trying to resolve those concepts and it's using up your willpower to do so. 

We think we're *so* in control of ourselves, rather than sugars and starches) so you can have an even supply of glucose and a steady source of willpower. Write down *everything* you can think of that you need to do, even if you just store that list somewhere you never see it (I like to tuck these things away in an Evernote document so that I know they're recorded, but I don't have to see them every day and get overwhelmed). Clean your place of living, because research shows that sitting in a messy place makes it *much* harder to make decisions and makes people much more likely to give up on tasks that require the exertion of willpower. 

---

**Further reading**

These aren't pop-psych concepts or trite, you can read about them and I *implore* you to do so. Here are my recommendations:

* ""Stumbling on Happiness"" by Daniel Gilbert: I don't like pop books that aren't supported by research

* ""Willpower: Rediscovering Mankind's Greatest Strength"" by Tierney and Baumeister: Baumeister is pretty much the original nexus for willpower research and this is a book co-written by him very recently. It's accessible

* ""The Science of Fear"" by Daniel Gardner: This one isn't about discipline

* Kahneman and Tversky (absolutely anything): These are the two guys who first pioneered the idea that the brain was a fallacious place, but somewhat readable by the general public. You could also check out original research by these two, though it's much more difficult to digest.

I kind of have a problem. Most of my friends would say that I am a very peaceful guy

When I was in middle school, I was alone, too (no friends). ~2 years ago I finally made some friends and I decided to try to let the positive feelings out, which was quite hard for me after a few years of isolation. Unfortunatly there also comes the urge to get in a fight which I have avoided quite well, because most of the time, we mostly met at the local pub, played games and had fun. But recently, who does have a few friends that I kind of feel attracted to

And this is where my problem really starts. I do feel a certain aggressivity in the air, I nearly got or got in a fight. Some random drunk (and aggressive) guy tried to hit on one of the girls and she stated a clear no, but he ignored it and remained persistant. He didn't touch her or anything, he only was standing in her way and stared at her. And then I started to stare at him and after one or two minutes he took notice of me and asked me what my problem was and I should stop staring at him. I kindly told him, to keep her alone, but kept staring at his eyes and he stared back and told me it's none of my fucking business. This went on for a short while, and suddenly I there was a rush of happiness or insanity, but suddenly I started smiling and he definitly didn't like it. He seemed stronger than me, I would be down for good, because apparantly they didnt want any troubles. Btw: they tried it the whole time

I kind of felt bad afterwards because I really enjoyed this confrontation. Can you help me with dealing with years of piled up hate and aggressiveness without getting into any trouble? Because I don't want to be like this.

I feel lost, sleeping in, not mediating. My legs barely function and google tells me its fatigue from either anxiety or depression. I do not know if its depression making its way back, malnutrition (even though I'm eating a balanced diet most days) or if its something worse neurologically . I am always fearful and getting started on any tasks takes an enormous amount of effort as well as twice as long to accomplish as any other person. My mind always feels foggy as if I'm operating at half speed and my want to better my thoughts and intelligence are replaced with useless subreddits and one movie after the next. Being alone scares me terribly as I cycle through negative thought after negative thought and means of meditation, positive reinforcement and youtube videos to help break my perspective and thought patterns. I've avoided alcohol like the plague but my want to do drugs only ever increases. I believe its my want of escapism the same way I use to be addicted to video games and pornography. I've stopped both with incredible difficulty and replaced with workouts and reading. At times this feels like a mistake but I'm seeing better use of my time in the longrun yet this time feels wasted even after 'accomplishments' have been made.

All I want to do is find a purpose. A meaning to my life and to bring my goals back to fruition but I feel lost to do so. A want and need to do great things but the lack of a support system to do so. My inability to help myself and better my relationships with my family due to my negligence of egotism and isolationism. I never feel as if it's enough. Ever. All I think about are the failures and trying to gain gratitude for my semi normal situation doesn't even register. Hell

Getting my mind

I've made strides one day at a time by keeping a healthy work out schedule; usually 5-6 time a week. The fog tends to lift after I get the workout in but the positive effects of the workout are soon lost. Eating a healthy diet or a least trying to of foods rich in tryptophan(fish, and isolated. I'm friendless and it sucks when I sit down to think about it. Any type of activity I can imagine to socialize to make friends has to revolve around alcohol and it bothers me. It's not as if I'm advocating being above alcohol but I feel social norms dictate drinking in order to have a good time and to make those who wish to be sober or at least a sense of sobriety feel insecure and diminished. Drinking only makes my thoughts worse in my mind and I do not want to pursue things that would inhibit my already delicate mental state. Elanor Roosevelt says ""Do one thing that scares you everyday"" and to me accepting my fears of rejection on this subreddit was one of them. Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated.

1347495274.0,zsmsb,Staying disciplined in your fitness goals and other goals in life,FWS02,37,1,4,"I stopped by here per a general


I've spent much of my life as a relatively sedentary individual.  I never got to be *severely* overweight, and even through my twenties, I never got to be more than 20-25 lbs overweight.  Even so, I was a terrible athlete growing up as well... anything with a ball, I was bad at.  All together, working out and being active just wasn't worth pursuing to me.


My dearly departed father neglected his health for his entire life.  At his heaviest, rarely took time to enjoy the vast joys in the world outside our family’s home, and wrapped up every conversation about introducing adventure into his OWN life with the words “when I retire”.


My father’s physical ability to take part in many of the joys of life was further limited by adult-onset diabetes in his 40’s.  Then


The tragedy of my father’s life and his passing so close to retirement has guided the trajectory of my life in my 30’s more than any other event in my life BY FAR.  The power of this lesson was further cemented by the early passing of my fiance’s father
parents of coworkers and others in the orbit of my life – all of these within a 12 month span.


To me there was one clear takeaway: **Do not let inaction rob you of your health or your ability to enjoy life NOW


My father’s passing was the spark… the initial motivation to start working out.  Not really knowing anything about fitness at this point


It was HARD… really hard.  I had pain and cramping in my feet and calves that made me want to quit early on, just to get it in.


I noticed a drop in weight, and a **HUGE** increase in energy.  But, as this subreddit banner hints at, my motivation was not yet a discipline.  I needed something else to push me forward.  I latched onto another challenging video workout series and completed that as well, but these series were short and didn’t really offer any truly *longterm* goals for me.


I started reading and learning more about fitness


Over the course of the last two years, a 6 ½ mile leg of a Pittsburgh Marathon relay team, [Run For Your Lives](http://runforyourlives.com) and, my proudest achievement: [The GoRuck Challenge]( https://www.goruckchallenge.com).  An 11 hour, 21 ½ mile endurance event that opened my eyes to what I’m truly capable of.


*NOTE: I can provide a group photograph of my medals and patches from these events as proof if anyone would like*


It’s so easy to start working out only to lose focus and lose motivation.  I’ve done it many times in my life, in a way be just as easy.  I’ve kept it going strong for two years now.  For me, it’s involved booking something on the calendar that *intimidates me*.  A concrete, non-refundable commitment that says “this is coming, whether you’re ready or not.  So get off your ass and get ready.”

This same logic applies to other adventures in your life.  How often do we have drinks with our friends and say “someday
d to do that!”  “Yeah


Fuck that!  Book it.  Make the call… make the plans… PLAN IT.  Book it.  Make these memories NOW.


In the last few years I’ve had more canoeing, backpacking, wine tasting and other adventures than I can count.  My fiancé and I take camping trips at least 6-8 weekends a year now.  I manage a poker league with my friends… it’s a REASON for us 30-somethings to get together every few weeks.  It keeps us involved in each others lives, and is a great platform for us to plan new adventures, *together*.


I’m not saying everyone should get into mud runs, having concrete commitments locked into the calendar galvanizes my commitments to better health and a better life.  Put something scary and/or exciting in front of you, COMMIT to it (come hell or high water), and let that be a light to guide you.  Hopefully this is of value to someone.  It’s served me well thus far.

**TL;DR** – The death of my father opened my eyes to the pitfalls of inaction and started me on the path towards a healthy

I'm posting this review to this subreddit because I love the community and I feel you all would receive it well and benefit from this book the most. I'll append edits to this review if I find anything else in my notes or if people would like more information in the comments.

As a disclaimer

**The Good:**  

One of the things that I dislike about a lot of self-help books it that science is always placed to the side in favor of anecdotal data. This book is not like that at all. It uses relevant studies and relevant data to explain the actual neurological conditions that make us do what we do

For example, eating, etc) to make us feel better. Yet after a few hours they tend to make us actually feel worse which is because the dopamine only affects the [reward system](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reward_system). Thus once the reward has been achieved, we no longer feel satisfied. This dopamine system was compared to the chemicals (serotonin, GABA, and oxytocin) which are released when doing activities such as exercising, playing sports, spending time with family/friends

There were so many more of these breakdowns of things that humans do but this was just an example. If you love to know *exactly* why we do the things that we do and how to change that

**The Bad:**

There weren't a lot of bad things with this book. I would have given it five stars but I felt like there could have been a few more chapters. Currently I have a hard time pinpointing what I felt was missing but if I'm sure that if I gave it another read I'd be able to.

**tldr;** It was a great book and I'd definitely recommend it if you were looking to read more about willpower and motivation.

Anyone know economics?  When supply meets demand, business begins.

In regards to discipline, and life expectations are the supply.  They are the businessmen that come out in the morning and say ""I have dreams for sale!  One dream for 1000 days of work!  Another dream for 3 years of effort!""  

Your energy, coming to the marketplace each day.  Sometimes there's a lot of buyers (when you get a good night's sleep, your mood levels are good, your stress levels are low, and your motivation is high).  That's great right?

Not necessarily.  Because sometimes there's a lot of buyers

What happens then is that these bigger goals and dreams go out of business

Instead, I don't need that 6 figure salary after all, I'll be satisfied with just 5.""  Or, ""All I want to do today is play games.  I have that game boss that I want to defeat.""   Or the worst is, ""I don't really have any goals for today.  I just want to chill out, relax, and enjoy the pleasures of life.""

Now you may think, everyone needs a break.

But the problem is, when demand increases, so does supply.  And when supply increases, the price begins to drop.  

Suddenly

So the goal of discipline is twofold - the first is to keep the big dreams and goals from going out of business.  The second is to keep the buyers coming in and willing to make the big-ticket purchases.

Now how do you get this to happen?

Let's introduce a third party - the VEHICLES.  

The buyers are out there, others have a 1-hour drive.  

In fact, on private islands, or even out of the country.  It can take them hours to get to the marketplace, but when they do get there, *they* are the ones who can make the big-ticket purchases.

Hence, horses, rafts, and there's fast vehicles - airplanes and spaceships.  Now, who do you want taking your buyers to the marketplace everyday - horses and camels, or jets and rockets?

The vehicles represent another important factor to get your buyers to the market place - and these are the HABITS.

You might have some good habits already.  Brushing your teeth, etc.  These guys may not take the buyers all the way to the destination, but they definitely make up part of the commute.  Without these guys, the big buyers may not even be able to reach the airport.

But they're not enough.  Until you develop the killer habits that you need to succeed

So let's say you decide to invest in a fast jumbo jet. This is probably a killer habit - something like

However, but it is not a fuel.

What is your fuel?  Attitude.  This is going to sound strange

Attitude - your attitude towards life

So in the end, and push out the toxic and lazy ones.  You have to stimulate the buyers to leave their homes and go to the marketplace, each and every day.  You have to invest in vehicles that go faster and farther than the basic ones.  And finally, you have to find the fuel - the fuel for your vehicles.  And you can't just create fuel - you gotta find it.  

As the government

You have a body, sometimes you’re down.

If you’re down, but it will be artificial and you’ll just crash harder and longer later.

Don’t use techniques or drugs to manipulate your body. Stop trying to squeeze so much productivity out of it. The harder you push yourself

Instead, don’t panic, don’t force yourself, just rest. Move when you’re ready to move.

The key is to carefully choose what you do when you’re up. What do you do? Do you do your most important work

Riding the emotional/chemical tides of your body while applying your energy towards your most important activity is real discipline. Sapping your body entirely of all its strength until you feel empty and dead is not. Carefully choosing how you spend your energy is better than trying to be more energetic.

TL:DR – Stop applying drugs and techniques to keep yourself disciplined. You’ll just crash. Instead, and apply your energy to your most important activity. This is the key to installing good habits and permanent change.

I got just about the best possible luck of the draw on life that I can imagine within reason. White upper-middle class male, real intellectual talents. I got into (early) college at fourteen, which, since I've only had one year interim, might be the most amazing thing I've done in my meager time here. Say what you will about social maturity, most of the kinks ironed themselves out pretty quick, but it did cast light on a pretty interesting problem that had been hiding hitherto inside itself.

Quite simply, I generally just let it slide. The quote up there is, in this fashion, partially true: instead of regret, motivation faded into denial and occasionally depression and cursing of the loins whence I sprung if I was unfortunate enough to get shown up by someone else.

Recently I got my first D in a class where I actually was completely confounded for most of the goings and didn't talk to a soul until far beyond the critical point. I have reason to believe that this won't be repeated, well, discipline beyond the most basic of social matters. Especially, I feel I lack what it takes (I guess the metaphorical fire) to keep going when, as they say, the going gets tough, or any stretch thereof.

That got me to thinking, what do you want to achieve in life (or what did you use to want for that matter), and how far along are you?

As for me, and got fairly far with that, but not all the way. I didn't like the lifestyle of a classical musician, especially being poor. I decided to switch paths to becoming a professional designer. Making that change was the hardest thing I've ever done, because I had to be a beginner again and give up getting the positive feedback from people for playing music all my life. Anyway, I've stuck to it for about 3 years now, and I can't say I don't regret it on occasion, ""why did you switch"" or not getting that recognition for achievement in music. 

My dream now is to have my own design agency. I work towards it little by little, life did not turn out the way I imagined, but I keep working towards a goal that I'm not even sure will make me happy when I achieve it, or if it is even possible. Maybe I started too late, etc.

Anyway sorry for the longish introspective story. I truly hope my honesty and candor however short inspires you to also write candidly about your own stage in life.

1355643068.0,14xmpd,Tip of the week (#2) - Embrace Failure.,StavromularBeta,29,1,4,"Evening all. Hope you all had a good week of achieving goals, with long library and gym hours- I can’t remember the last time I saw the sun.

This week’s tip has drawn its inspiration from the many times I haven’t succeeded this week. See, and missing my regular workout, I thought a little bit about failure and its importance in our lives. Thus, I bring to you:

Tip of the week (#2) - Embrace Failure.

If I were to hazard a guess, or form today. From a dope-fuelled eating binge, to not finishing a workout, to something as small as slipping on your shoes instead of undoing the laces -what **would** your mother have to say about that- we all fail all the time. The trick to failure is understanding how to work with it, how to take advantage of it, and how to use it as a powerful tool instead of the curse it can seem to be.

Without failure, different food. Maybe you were trying to lift too much. Don’t skip the next day out of fear that you will give up again. Why did I lose focus, and waste a whole day instead of studying for that important midterm? Maybe I need to be in a space that allows me to focus. Maybe I should get rid of some distractions. Maybe I should try different methods of studying. Why did I just eat an entire box of cookies when I am trying to cut weight? Maybe I should let myself eat a few cookies occasionally; maybe I shouldn’t be buying the cookies in the first place. Maybe I shouldn’t go grocery shopping hungry.  Don’t give up on your diet because of one slip- instead, use that slip to strengthen your resolve to reach your nutrition goals. Don’t take away negativity from your failures, use them as a tool. Don’t fear failure. Embrace it and learn from it, and that will give you the power to get yourself back on the right track time and time again.

When you really think about it, I probably wasn’t aiming high enough.

Now, and if you do, why? What are your thoughts on using failure as a tool instead of trying your best to avoid it?

Tip of the week (#3)- clean

Every single one of us can relate to these three tenets- we make messes, from hoarders- a TLC staple- to shows where old Scottish ladies clean your house. We are, as a society, obsessed with organization and cleanliness and all that good stuff. If you haven't already, it's time to jump on the bandwagon.

To start off your purge, you might not even notice. They say to feel rejuvenated, you should throw three things away. A good technique for clothes is to hang everything a certain way, and flip the coat hanger around when you  wear something. If you find that in six months something hasn't been warn, take it to a thrift store. 

Hopefully now you are down to the essentials, the easier it is to stay organized. Don't develop complex organizational systems, they never work. Keep it simple. 

Finally

Now, take stock of your belongings and, at the very least, get rid of three things. This small 15 minutes a day will help you streamline your life, and enable you to be more efficient.

Today, 2013. For the next seven days, I will not watch any TV, play any video games, watch any YouTube videos, watch any porn, browse reddit or do anything of that nature. My goal is to get a head on my school work, increase productivity

I have made two long term goals for this summer semester: get an A in both of my summer classes and to start working out regularly. For the exercising, but they move extremely fast and I have gotten a bit lazy. I am doing well in them, a b in macro and an a in the online class but this is not good enough. I need an a in macro and I need to be substantially ahead in both. Maybe that will happen this week. 

This may seem like overkill, where I scramble to get it done). Every time I chose the difficult option, I become stronger. Every time I chose the easy option, I become weaker. I have become weak, and that is not okay. This week I want to grow stronger


Okay I forgot a few things. I do not think that those leisure activities I listed above are bad things. They are not these evil monsters our generation of degenerates has ruined our lives with. Many of them are passions and hobbies of mine that I enjoy and value deeply. The whole point of this is overkill. It is supposed to be difficult. Why? To show I can do it. Also, I am aloud to do social shit, as long as I have gotten my work done for that day. I have become even more scared of social situations. I have become so scared of socializing, I lost touch with a few friends. In addition to socializing, I can read books and do other self improving activities if I have gotten my work done.


Edit: I encourage you to join me. Pick something then go all out for a week. Why? To show that you can. If you are thinking ""uhh I don't think I can do that"" or ""uhh that sounds like a good idea but it sounds like it sucks"" then you really need to join me! Prove that you can.

I have a part time job in which i understand my role and its importance so I work hard at it, however it is simply a job for the sake of having a job and I only work 3 times a week with 3-4 hour shifts.

I laze around the house in trackies and a dressing gown most of the time currently ( admittedly its due to the house being ridiculously cold, cleaning or otherwise is done for me, i game too often for it to be called a hobby. i do not work out other than a weekly game of basketball i do with friends on sunday's, training's are not included in that. 

I smoke marijuana and have it under control, which i would like too ). My friends are similar in their partaking, yet most of them are motivated and have clear goals in which they wish to achieve.

i have a goal, when it should be **as soon as possible.** My uni schedule is only two classes over three days ( though my Maths and Physics for Games class pretty much takes up about the effort of 3 classes to get outstanding work, yet still i only do the minimum ). It's not a lack of wits as to why i only do the minimum, just a lack of applying myself.

This one talks about the fact that the feeling of motivation comes and goes just like any other emotion.  What we really need to get things done consistently is discipline and strong

- [Continuous improvement](http://redd.it/scair)

This one talks about improving slowly

The key idea behind this one is that you can form discipline for difficult tasks by making them easy FIRST and slowly building up.

* Post using the provided formats and share your story. 

* Read other reports and success stories to inspire and motivate yourself.

* Report regularly to hold yourself accountable. Meet other people and set up support networks to motivate yourself when needed.

* Provide positive feedback to others and help solve problems when needed.

 **TL:DR – You will remain miserable as long as you believe that success or fulfillment is just around the corner. Fulfillment, your goal will eternally recede into the horizon.**

If you are dissatisfied with being fat

It doesn’t matter how much will-power you have, or even how determined you are. If your action stems from dissatisfaction, it will only deliver more dissatisfaction.

If you are waking your ass up and going to the gym every morning, more frustrating until you give up. You cannot win when you are fighting yourself.

When creating permanent change in your life, rich, healthy, influential people already felt good before they did what they did. What you create is a reflection of how you feel.

This doesn’t mean to resign and stop trying. Nor does it mean to give up on yourself. You can create your life in any way you wish – it’s your god-given right as a human. What it DOES mean though

Maybe make a list of things you’ll miss about being a smoker once you stop smoking – and at least enjoy smoking as long as you’re doing it. You won’t be able to smoke later when you stop smoking

If you relapse and eat a box of Oreos or spend $200 bucks on something stupid

This isn’t bad advice


You’ll remain stuck as long as you’re having a bad time

You can have it all. You can be every bit as successful as you’d like. But stop waiting for it. Look for it Now. Get your head out of the future and bring yourself here, it’s coming.

This article is from Harvard Business Review and is purporting the benefits of meditation for business professionals.  An extract:

*""Meditating daily will strengthen your willpower muscle. Your urges won't disappear

The essence of the article is that since meditation requires you to focus on something simple like your breathing but your mind inevitably flits to other matters.  Meditating trains your mind to focus and be disciplined by resisting distracting urges though the practice or returning to your breathing when your mind wanders.

I guess I'm just so easily discouraged by what I write. Not because I'm a bad writer

***

In the end of 2012, and I looked around and decided to start setting some serious goals for 2013, (not something vague like ""Get my shit together"") and I'm wonder who's coming with me?

**Should you get serious about setting some real goals?** - It's been said many times that if you fail to plan you plan to fail

&gt; ""For 24 years I was 'going' to lose weight. But, it was only when I did that that a goal became a reality and I lost the weight"" - [Goals 1 of 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ae-VJ_lauCw)

&gt; ""The people who wait for changes out there before making changes in here are the ones that will end up [like biscuits what fail to rise].  The rule is simple 'You do it now'."" - [Goals 2 of 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kiQV0oTyd98)

&gt; ""You can't make it as a wandering generality

**How would you get serious about setting goals?** - Most of this is adapted from [this article](http://www.goals2go.com/articles/zig-ziglar-goal-setting.htm) 

**Part 1.** Dream - figure out all of the possible things that you would like to do.  Think big. Spend a week working on this so you can wring your brain like a dish rag. During this next week devote at least two private sessions to dreaming. We want you to create a Dream List filled with ideas. Your list should include at least 25 dreams about what you want to be

**Part 2.** Why? -  After you complete your list, then it's not a dream and it won' become a goal. Cross it off your list.

**Part 3.** Question - Ask the following five questions of every dream on the Dream List you created last week.

1. Is it really MY goal?
2. Is it morally right and fair to everyone concerned?
3. Is it consistent with my other goals?
4. Can I emotionally commit myself to finish this goal?
5. Can I ""see"" myself reaching this goal? 

You must answer ""yes"" to all five questions for each dream

**Part 4.** Categorize - Ask the following seven questions of every dream that remains on your Dream List (or goals list). Will reaching this goal . . .

* A. help me take a step forward in my work?
* B. make me healthier?
* C. make me happier?
* D. win me more friends?
* E. give me peace of mind?
* F. make me more financially secure?
* G. improve my close relationships?

Now if you can't answer Yes to at least one of these questions for each dream

After asking the questions posted part 4 you will have eliminated some of your dreams. Actually, you're better off without them.

**Part 5.** Time Range - Separate your remaining list of goals into one of three categories: Short-range (one month or less to achieve this goal)

Remember: Some goals must be BIG to make you stretch and grow to your full potential. Some goals must be long-range to keep you on track and greatly reduce the possibility of short-range frustrations. Some goals must be small and daily to keep you disciplined. Some goals must be ongoing. Some goals (i.e., education, etc.) may require analysis and consultation to determine where you are before you can set the goals. Most goals should be specific. A ""nice home"" is not as good as a ""3,000 square-foot, Tudor- style home with four bedrooms, three full baths, and two living spaces.""

**Part 6.** For the goals you are going to pursue fill out one of these [goal setting worksheets](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/11885920/Goals%20Worksheet.doc).  And be really thoughtful about it.  

Be sure to work each goal through the process of the chart. Be selective. You may not be able to work on all of your goals at one time! Don't over do it. Don't overemphasize one area. If you only have time to complete one or two goals for the remainder of this year

**Part 7.** Setting the goal - Everything else was just determing what is the right goal to pursue

***
**The Dream of What You'd Like to Achieve**:

- Specific - What is the desired result? (who, why, how):
- Measurable -How can you quantify (numerically or descriptively) completion?:
- How can you measure progress towards completion?:
- Attainable - What skills are needed?:
- What resources are necessary?:
- Are you prepared to make the commitments necessary in order to achieve?:
- Realistic - What obstacles will you face?	:
- Time Certain - What is the date you will achieve?: 
- Final Goal (Begin goal statement with ""I'm so happy and grateful now that…"" state goal in present tense: ""I am.."" ""I have…""

-  Exercising intensely has given me the strength of will to push through when I am finding something difficult.  When I make an aim to run a certain amount I am not getting off that treadmill until I have done it.  This is useful when you are doing a challenging task - you can just power through and not give yourself a choice!

-  Dieting has helped me fight that little voice in my head which tries to tempt me to give in.  This has always been a bigger problem for me than powering through because you basically convince yourself that giving into temptation just once isn't just a big deal.  Unfortunately

The other change which I have made is to really start of at a low, I am learning spanish vocab using a frequency dictionary deck on anki (definitely recommend this btw!).  In the past I have tried doing 100 words a day but after a few days I burn out.  So instead I started at 20 words and every week I increase the number by 10%.  This gradual change in difficulty hasn't been noticeable at all.  I have just started doing this with running as well now and it's working out great!  Part of the reason I fail at being disciplined is because I set myself tasks which require too much commitment for my current level of willpower I think.

The GPS was old, and it stopped working. I followed a few cars that had kids in it, and I managed to get there on time.

I start taking the test, but the test would be canceled and not graded. I half heartedly did the test and went home. I was so depressed. I rested, and took a break from this project. I watched some TV and played some games. I got some food, and went back to work.

1366825593.0,1d0tzn,Any one else find they perform better when competing?,GetCompetitive,27,6,14,"Hi Guys

I have been thinking about competition and how it related to discipline

Whenever I look back on my life, and if I saw someone coming close to my level I would go into studying like crazy to maintain my position. Even better yet, if I was ever knocked from the top spot, I was even more motivated to get it back.

The problem is, but although somewhat correct, it is not particularly motivational. In fact, it may be quite unmotivational. I just don't seem to do to well with the 'soft touch' abstract motivational/disciplinary techniques. They work for some, but I just dont respond very well to them in the long term.

I think it really depends on the person. I could imagine for some people being in competition would have the opposite effect. Don't get me wrong, but I tend to find their effect is only temporary. Theres nothing outside of yourself to keep you on track. Once the initial burst of enthusiasm has died down you are back to square one. The same for the various disciplinary techniques here. Many of them are very good and practical tool, but there just doesn't ever seem to be the motivation to keep at it 24/7.

Nature has ingrained us to compete with other people. Whether it be for food

Ideally, is maybe putting together a buddy system or maybe just creating a group. All it would require is some sort of shared goal and parametres which are agreed by everyone. Just a nice it of friendly competition (of unfriendly if you respond better to it ;))

So for example, as we are exploiting that competitive drive to improve ourselves).

Naturally, as its not the goal of 'winning' you are striving for, but the goal of doing whatever activity it is consistently. So if you cheated, as cliche as it sounds, you would only be cheating yourself. There may be some goals where you can actually give objective evidence of your activity, eg those running GPS phone apps, or if its to write 500 words of a book or something. Those sorts of competition are even better as its measurable. For stuff like 'study for 2 hours per day' it may be harder to verify, people who would cheat are just cheating themselves. If anything it would spur the other person on even more

I suppose it would be simular to those trackers that people post here from time to time where they award points and things for each day they do all their stated goals. However it would be 2 or more trackers, point systems, etc.

getting back to working on your goal

i am reading this because i currently have no enthusiasm for reaching my set goal. i realize that i am in a completely different mental state than i was when i set out to achieve my goal. my excitement has been replaced by apathy- but the fact that i am reading this means that i still want to achieve my goal, i am one of the few who, despite the temporary hardships and failures, refuses to give in and quit. i may be at my lowest point right now, but the mere fact that i am reading this means i have NOT given up on my goal- and the fact that i haven't given up on my goal, even at my lowest point, means that i will be certain to achieve it. this will get me through the worst of times, but reading this will serve as a reminder of the way i felt when i first decided to achieve my goal, that shiver of pure excitement and euphoria that i had when i set my goal in the first place. it will all return when i climb out of this hole. i am beginning to displace negative thoughts with thoughts of success, and goal achieving CANNOT simultaneously exist in a mind filled with thoughts of fear

[DO IT]

now that i have cleared a bit of space in my mind, and never give up.

[DO IT]

now i am beginning to feel the gradual return of those same feelings i had when i made my goal; of excitement, and want them to return. i WANT to keep working towards my goal. i WANT to achieve it. i WILL NOT let failure, feeling low, or external circumstances stand in my way- i will find a way around ALL obstacles, no matter WHAT. i will NEVER give in to defeat. the fact that i am reading this at my lowest moment is testament to my true DESIRE to achieve my goal, no matter what. even though i may go through dark times, i will ALWAYS come out again, hold you back, i resolve to expose him whenever he tries to sneakily trip me up, and feel a swell of pride and satisfaction come over me

I'm using Evernote to keep track of my system. In one note I have a table with two columns

For example: 

* study for 2 hours - 15 mins of game time

* study for 4 hours in one day - 1 Netflix episode

* wake up before 7 AM - 15 mins of game time

* wake up before 7 AM for five days in a row - take half a day off

* get more than 90% on an assignment - add £15 to the game budget

(I'm a university student in case people are wondering)

I keep track of the rewards I have earned in another note. When I spend them I alter the note.

I've tried to make it pretty balanced. I know that if I make it too easy I will just exploit it, so my reward for going to those is to have half a day off (when I have time off I allow myself to do whatever I want, even if I don't have the rewards to spend, but I'm not allowed to gain any rewards during that time). I can choose to save up the rewards for however long I want.

I would appreciate advice

I've got a lot of unpaid bills and fines mostly because I don't have the discipline to save any money but instead go out spending. I have no money in my savings.

I've got a baby coming in a few months and I really want to get myself in a position where I can spend time at home and see my baby while being motivated to work. I'd like to quit my part time job and go full self employed. I'm in the IT field and can usually work from home or drive to a clients house.

I also watch a lot of videos on Youtube - series put out by people I like. I started doing this but realised I was coming home, etc. Now I feel the urge to always watch them, even though they distract me when I need to focus on things.

Since I was about 12 I have had this problem of becoming more tired and lazier every day. I think it started from staying up all night and playing video games instead of going out and getting things done.

Now at 20 it is really killing me when I am trying to have my business grow and I need to put in the effort to become successful. I have trouble waking up and getting out of bed at a reasonable hour and throughout the day I ""need"" naps. While I try to get things done I get one small thing done and then go back to a break instead of focusing throughout the day at the different tasks at hand.

Any advice on how to get over this would be greatly appreciated.

Some info:
Generally fall asleep at 1am try to wake up at 7am usually manage to wake up at 9:30am if I am lucky

I have tried to use the sleep cycle app to help wake me up better.

I have tried cold showers to get my body jump started. 

I workout every morning and try to exercise throughout the day. 

I forgot to mention I am also on the paleo diet and tried drinking a gallon of water a day.

1368009765.0,1dxar8,Courage's Column #3 - Creating an ultimate goal list,TheCourageWolf,23,2,4,"From my first column I had this question

&gt;Do you have any guidelines on how to create good goals?

I'll cover the answer to that here.

When you're coming to create the first draft of your goals list

**Step 1 - Grab it all**

If you could have everything you wanted

If you could change anything in your life

What would you change about

your body

your finances

your relationships

your influence on others

your career

your impact on the world

All your dreams and desires, the mansion, the life, the fame - whatever you want.

Set a timer for up 20 minutes and write non-stop all the things you'd like to achieve.

**Step 2 - Prioritize**

Written down everything you've ever wanted?

Good.  You can't have it all.

Go through the list and ask yourself the question

**""How much better would my life be if I already achieved this goal?""**

I personally used a 1-10 scoring system where 10 was basically ""living the dream"" 4 was ""about the same as it is now"" and anything less than 4 was ""worse than now!"".

**Step 3 - Sort**

Rewrite your list with the 10 stuff at top and the 1 at the bottom.

**Step 4 - Condense**

You're probably going to have some overlapping goals.

For instance:

- own a mansion

- own a superyatch

- ferrari

- overseas holidays

- retire at 35

All of these are wealth related goals

- lose weight

- get a six pack

- bench 200 pounds

Are all fitness related.  I'm sure you get the idea.

**Step 5 - Pick your projects**

I like to think of big goals as projects.  You can break them down into smaller goals or milestones and set time lines and allocate blocks of time during your week to work on them.

Also if someone asks you ""What are you doing"" and you say ""Trying to get rich"" you might get an odd look but if you say ""I'm working on my wealth and investment project"" I bet you'll come off as more mature.

But as you block time during your week to work on these projects you face a problem, but it seems like if you can't put in an hour a week into a project it's probably not worth it.

The idea is to start with maybe one or two projects

**Step 6 - SMART goals**

Really I think putting the hours in to your projects is the recipe for achieving them but if you want to go a step further with your planning you can make your goals SMART

Specific

Measurable

Attainable

Realistic

Time-based

The idea is that you make sure your goals fit these criteria so you can measure your progress to ensure you're heading towards your goal and it wasn't too crazy.

**Step 7 - Make them part of you**

Add your projects to your inspiration sheet.  Keep them with you everywhere you go and make sure you read over them often!",,t5_2uzju,False,,Star,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1dxar8/courages_column_3_creating_an_ultimate_goal_list/

So take advantage of that split second of clarity, instead, just do it. Close your computer, get up from your desk or out of your bed and do the first thing that comes to your mind that will get you closer to your goals.


You **will** return to Reddit. The fog will come back but each time that moment of clarity will last a little longer because you gave it strength and purpose last time around. And with each cycle

I just happened to see what I got for those classes and it was 2 B's, 1 D, and 1 C. Not the best grades. I convinced my parents to go back to Uni for the next semester and my slacking followed. I managed to get my gpa up, but only a measly 2.18. That's where I am now. I wanted to go back to Uni just because I didn't want to be home. I will not be able to go back to any college next semester missing the deadline for any other colleges and deciding not to go back to Uni for my own good.

As of life in general, and unmotivated s.o.b. I spend most of my free time playing any kind of game I can get my hands on, just to keep time going by. I wake up at around 11am-12pm and I don't even brush my teeth. I just get a bit of food to get the taste out of my mouth (gross I know). I get continuous lectures about my life and myself from my parents. And they're right, I've done nothing good with my life ever since I went to Uni, even before.

Back a few years, and one incident, put dirt in my hat and glove. I was defenseless and just cried to my dad. I was out of baseball for good, until I was taken to another league (surprisingly better). This happened to be the time I was also a senior in high school. I was enrolled in both the High school team and other league team and I resented the H.S. because they were a bunch of jokes. I didn't get along with anybody on the H.S. team, nor a bunch of the others in the league (only until later). Thing is, I didn't really want to do any baseball that year, I was pressured by my dad because I didn't make decisions myself. During that year as well, costing over $1

Today is the time where I have to make a decision. I have no job, not going for a career there. I have no phone due to rage from my parents (good thing), I'm restricted when they're here, but I do whatever I want when they're not.

I know I am to blame for all that has happened to me. I have wasted so much of there money for college (around 30k), move to Canada, and just live life from there. That's the master plan. But with all that is going on so far, that plan just doesn't seem... probable. I have done a few things to change my perspective on life. I hated going to the gym, but after going a few times with my brother to Planet Fitness, I quite like it and want to get a membership myself. I have tried to cut down on game time, hardly playing my Xbox, trying to pick up a few books along the way.

So my real questions would be...
1. What can I do to change my life around? Starting from the little things
2. Knowing I've messed up in college in both grades and money
3. Does it look like I'm a failure in my life? I feel so bad that I've done absolutely nothing to make myself better in life and now I'm paying for it.
4. Are there any tips to make my dream of Psychology and Canada a reality?
5. Would the US Reserves be a viable option to even think about? (I honestly do not want to do it

**Do you have a written list of goals that you look at at least once a week?**

This is a pretty clear question.  You either do or you don't.  Ask yourself and give an honest answer.

I asked myself this question a few weeks ago and realized that I had various old goal lists on my computer and on bits of paper in my files but I didn't have a single list that I looked at frequently.  I had a list on my phone

That's changed now.  I got myself a piece of paper and started a fresh list.  I keep it in my back pocket at all times, I note it on my bit of paper - it's not just about goals but about habits I could improve, areas of my life that deserve more attention and random motivational thoughts.

When my bit of paper gets full

The thing about written goals is that everyone knows they work but few people have them.  It's one of those things that you really only ""know it"" when you ""do it"".

So you'll come away from reading this and I will either convince you to have a written goal list that you carry around with you or you will decide that this post is just rehashing old goal stuff you already know.

Your move.

This pattern causes at least two secondary problems. First, the pattern causes the desires to stick around longer, since we've learned we act on them inevitably. 

Solution: In short, you have to learn. No one can really explain how to let go, it's something you have to experience yourself.**

I can't stop thinking about the unbelievable amount of time I've wasted. I'm scared that even if I work my ass off now... it's too late.

Can anyone else relate to this? Would love to hear from you.",,t5_2uzju,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1i95lo/does_anyone_else_still_feel_bad_even_after/
1373691803.0,1i7bqv,Too many goals?,JapanCode,20,2,15,"**PS: VERY LONG POST! Sorry! I was writting and the words just kept coming. Wasn't expecting it to be so long haha!**


Hello. I have a question for /r/getdisciplined ! Do you think I have too many goals?

First a little back info about myself: I am a 19 year old guy, then I did a 1 semester and a half of [CEGEP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CEGEP) after which I dropped out because I had no idea where I wanted to go in life and I felt like I needed a break. Few months later in October I got a full time job in the backstore of a major retailer, and fastforward to today and I am still working that job. I absolutely do not regret taking this time off as I've grown a lot and learned a lot. My current plan is to keep saving money s othat in march/april I can go to Japan for 2 weeks, and then start back CEGEP in august 2014.

Now to this post

**Goals I am currently working on**

* Be in bed at 1 and get up at 8:30

To explain this one a little bit, but usually that ends up in me browsing reddit/youtube for too long. I am getting better though, I often get to bed at 1:30 instead of 2-3.

* Learn Japanese

Well I don't really need to explain this too much. I've started learning japanese 2 months ago after wanting to learn the language for a while and I'm going to visit there next march/april and plan to go study there as part of a study abroad program for university. All I can say here is that the amount I do everyday isn't calculated in time but in how much I do

Also another part of how I'm learning japanese is immersion. A good way to speed up the progress of learning, but I obviously don't have the opportunity to immerse myself all that much. That being said, I do enjoy watching anime and reading manga, especially if it helps my japanese!

* Making Let's Plays

Now this might seem like a weird thing to put on here, an excuse to not drop gaming. But this is a good thing! How? Well first, making Let's Plays helps me with my spoken english. As I've said, my native language isn't english. I've had a lot of written practice, and while I am nowhere near perfect, I can easily hold conversations with native english speakers. On the other hand, I've barely had any spoken practice, I hope to create a need for me to speak english, because I will be doing this by playing games. Another thing, because that's the only way I will manage to maintain an entertaining commentary. So by playing videos games

* Guitar

Now this one is a bit vague, but most of the time I play more than that and thus I get better. I also make guitar covers on youtube for two reasons. The first one is just to show my friends and family what I am learning and playing and that I actually AM still playing. The second and biggest reason is so that I can look back and see the progress I've done. I remember when I made those videos I did a few years back; I thought they were the shit! But now I think they are shit! :p 


**Goals I have yet to start working on

* Lose weight / get in shape

Now this maybe I should've put in the goals I'm working on but really I'm not. When I started working, but I've stopped loosing weight months ago and have stayed stable here. It is time for me to do more exercise outside of work and slowly change my diet to something a bit more healthy. Which leads me to my next goal...

* Stop buying junk food at work

Like I said, well, unhealthy. So I want to try to stop that. As for the second part, sometimes I will go and buy.. let's say, a salad. But because of it, I end up not eating all the food I brought for dinner. Sure the salad was healthy, but so was my dinner, that money saved would've been able to go towards my trip to japan + my studies. 5 bucks might not seem like a lot on the spot; but it adds up!


**CONCLUSION**

Now back to my question; do you think I have too many goals? I definitely have enough time to do these things, and what is gonna be repercuted (is this even a word?) the most if I skip a day? Usually the answer is Japanese; that is always my #1 focus. After that, it's a total blur and everything seems to be on the same level of important-ness. My problem is that even if I have the time to do all of this, I often end up lacking the motivation / discipline to do this. And also, when I get back to school, how will I manage to go to school, do my homework/studying, commute, or be able to ask a question that will make me realise what my real question is (not that this isn't a real question

Well either way

Hey

I want to discipline myself and be able to fit 90 minutes of study into my routine. Now I wake up at 5am and have to leave at 650am for uni. 10 minutes for breakfast (I never skip my oats) and 10 minutes to dress and get ready. That leaves enough time for some nice study to get done. I usually sleep at around 10-11pm and am refreshed at 5 am. I am doing a science-based degree and my subjects include psychology

Only problem is; I can't bring myself to do it.

If try to start

Some main things I need:

- to be able to keep myself awake at that time
- to psych myself up in order to be able to study 
- to be punctual and not slack off


Some questions:

a) should i start off small e.g. 30 minutes of study or should i try to implement the larger 90 minutes of study?

b) should i use the pomodoro technique and try to do three sets of 25 minutes study + 5 minute break?

c) What type of study should this be; revising notes, doing calculation questions?


p.s. I thought of posting this to getstudying

Can anyone please help me with a step by step method outline of how i can  break this barrier and start this schedule?

So through what I perceived as an herculean effort I got myself out of bed and into the shower. It was only when my shower suddenly turned cold I really woke up.

I think my alarm woke me when I was in the middle of a so called deep sleep cycle and it made it therefore harder to get up on time. 
Tonight I'm turning in earlier so that my natural waking up time is more in tune with my alarm.

Some commenter have suggested

For everyone having trouble with sleeping on time: read a book! I've been trying it only for two days but I really think a smartphone keeps you awake. Research suggests that the backlighting of the screen stop the production of melatonin

We need discipline if we are going to put in the consistent and dedicated work required to achieve our goals.  I used to associate the idea of discipline with strict timetables, this was unsustainable.

The problem is that if you have a remotely busy life then you can expect to have any number of random events happen which can throw you off schedule.  At points I have had to study late at college, all at irregular or unexpected hours.  The problem I experienced was that I had tied my discipline in with various parameters such as the time of day or location, and due to these events these parameters had changed.  I would have a notion of a “morning run”, or reading before bed, but then when these were no longer possible for some reason I would give up on the habit, “fall off the wagon” and completely regress.

Your life isn’t static, then switch to something like swimming.

The key here is thinking practically and making the best of a situation rather than expecting things to go perfectly and falling apart when they don’t.

1. Share how we are getting disciplined.

2. Ask for advice on getting disciplined.

**Outline**

- Goal.  What is the end product of the discipline you are aiming to achieve?

- Plan.  To know if you are being disciplined you need a daily plan

- Execution.  What things can you do to help you carry out your plan daily? 

---------

**RPM Method**

Need to add how you will measure your results and also measure how well you are carrying out your plan.

For example if you a learning a skill

For weight loss you can measure your weight (measuring the result) but you can also measure your exercise and diet (energy expenditure and energy intake).


**Result**

- What result do you want?  Be as specific as possible.

**Plan**

- What is your daily/weekly plan for getting this result?

Losing weight: do exercise X 30 minutes every day

Study: 1 hour self study on weekdays

- Do you have a plan that someone else has followed and obtained the result you want?

Losing weight: couch to 5k

Study: one mentioned above or something in /r/getstudying

**Motivators**

- Extrinsic motivators: Why do you want this result?

Losing weight: increased confidence, positive attention, increased stamina.

Study: increased knowledge

- Intrinsic motivators: What do you enjoy about the task itself?

For losing weight

For study, enjoying thinking through problems and content you are study.  The process of writing out notes by hand, or maybe even enjoying group study with classmates.

**Measurement**

- How will you measure your result?

For losing weight this would be measuring your weight and tracking it.
For study this would be your exam mark.

- How will you measure your performance?

For losing weight this would be measuring your caloric intake and expenditure through exercise.

For study this would be the number of hours you have studied this week.

(There's a fairly concise TL;DR at the bottom

I'm a 26 year old dude. I've been composing music and playing instruments since I was like 6, If I'm honest with myself, this is clearly not what my actions are showing.

I live with my mom, in which I express intending to risk my financial future in the sake of concentrating all of my efforts in creating great music. My rationalization comes from being in such a comfortable and rare position in life right now, one in which I don't need to work to survive (thanks to my parents); plus the fact that I perceive myself (others as well) as being exceptionally talented. This mix generates in me a sense of duty, and I like it.

But there's a problem. The truth is, is by envisioning big financial rewards coming from my music, in the future. But I think this has been a mistake, cause now the act of composing carries a big load: my financial independence. This has generated lots of anxiety over the years, and in consequence, serious procrastination.

When I finished high school I thought about pursuing an academic career in music, but they supported my decision. After about six months of waking every morning at 2:00 o' clock and spending every afternoon drinking beer with my band mates in the studio, I accepted the truth: I was making music, and it was good; but I wasn't spending ALL of my time and effort in doing it; not even nearly. So I went back to college and graduated last December.

During college, but it wasn't enough to make a living; so I stuck to my plan.

I've been working on a music project for about 3 and a half years now, because I love making music, but I'm freaking addicted to this procrastination crap. So I'm beginning to think that risking my financial future for it might be worthless, because I'm not getting it done.

Last week, but the schedule is a nightmare. I would be working from 9 to 9 or even 10 o' clock at night. I accepted, but I yet have to talk to some people to make it official.

I'm profoundly worried about not having enough time to make my music

I know I will be able to be fairly disciplined at this job

I've been telling myself that this is not a death sentence. That I could quit whenever I want

What scares me is that I might get to comfortable in the job

Should I try it out, artist life I've always dreamed of?

TL;DR: I want to spend my life making music in purely artistic terms

This illness has been with me for so long that over the years I stopped thinking of it as ""depression."" It was simply life. For as far back as I could recall, even as I appeared on the outside to be living a reasonably decent life. It seeped into every corner of my existence, preventing me from feeling true joy no matter how content I seemed, to others and to myself, on the surface. I could not experience the apparent happiness of the people who surrounded me and loved me, though I wanted to desperately. I began to suspect that happiness was genetic, like a good singing voice, and there's nothing to be done for those of us who fall into the former category. 

I found comfort in food and in other sensory pleasures. Drugs appealed to me naturally. I abused anything that could help lift me temporarily out of the agonizing dullness of my existence

I have never treated myself well. I abused my body and mind, I despised the person I was, and saw no reason why I should be kind to him. He could die, for all I cared. 

And I thought I would, and in all likelihood by my own hand.

When I was 17, but I had never been all that committed to it, and thus the therapy proved mostly ineffectual. I went in this time fully expecting it to be the same. 

Except something was different. I had matured emotionally, I found myself opening up to this man, one of the kindest men I've ever known, and out spilled, like water breaking through a dam, years of pent up anguish. It was then that I realized how desperate I was for a cure. With my therapist's help, I began the long process of understanding, my demons. This in part meant consenting with his request that I give antidepressants another try

It's been three years since then, and I have only recently begun to enjoy the fruits of my labor. But oh how sweet they are. 

Around a year ago I had a stunning revelation: I did not hate myself anymore. In fact, welcoming place, full of wonderful things I had never before dreamed could be mine. 

My progress in therapy had illuminated for me the path to lasting happiness; a path paved by hard work and simple, whomever they may be.

I now rejoice in discipline. I have beaten bulimia, and am confident in my ability to abstain from using it in the future. I am making an active effort to develop more meaningful relationships with the people around me. I am even beginning to fall in love with someone, a sensation more powerful than anything I have ever felt. It is a little terrifying, to be honest, but in a good way.

I am careful not to be swept away by austerity. I reward myself when I feel I deserve to be rewarded. I never let a workout routine or a diet get in the way of my enjoyment of life. Spontaneity is your friend. If an old buddy from high school calls me up

It is good to be proud. It is good to be in love with yourself. There is no shame in love. Never forget that.

1373182800.0,1hskqc,I'm LARPing Towards a Better Life,morningsaystoidleon,23,6,12,"OK

I enjoy using techniques like the Pomodoro (look it up if you don't know it) and the NOW Habit (basically adds structure to the Pomodoro thing), and it needs to be exercised.  

I was playing a video game the other day and I thought that it'd be awesome if life worked like an RPG; every time you completed some repetitive action

So I decided to design something like that for myself.  I've written out my game below

**Assigning Value to Everyday Tasks**

I opened up a spreadsheet and, with 10 being the max.  

For example

In another column, it's worth 700 points.  Obviously, some of these point values are arbitrary.


**Leveling Up**


I needed to earn 100 points in a single day to get to Level 2, and I need to take more positive actions and complete more positive goals to get to that next level.  However, I'm also becoming more organized, more in shape, and more productive every day, so while I might not level as frequently, it's never out of reach.

I can level up more than once per day, but I need 110--it gets wiped back to nothing for the next day.

**Reward System**

The important part is the instant gratification.  It's the way we're wired, I take $20 from my bank account and spend it in a fun or creative way.  If you're on a tight budget, you might treat yourself to a few hours of some activity that you enjoy.  

Anyways, probably because it uses a simple reward system to make tasks more attractive.  

I've also added other stuff to make it a little more complex.  For instance, but 10 points if it's nonfiction or a classic.

1349995007.0,11c1v1,Psychological Self-Help by Dr. Clayton E. Tucker-Ladd,ThereIsNoJustice,18,4,4,"http://www.psychologicalselfhelp.org/ (A free

You will likely want to read chapters 4, almost like a textbook. Would anyone like to do weekly discussions on the chapters relating to motivation/discipline? (Or post what helped you in this thread) 

This preview will give you some idea of what to expect:
&gt;Motivation is trying to reach our goals. But, as discussed in chapter 3, although that is a critical step. It is common to wish for higher goals than we are willing to do the work to attain. We want to be a lawyer but goof off in high school. Many college students with a 2.7 GPA want to become PhD’s. We want to be a star performer but don't like to practice. Even when trying to better ourselves we may lack the motivation. For example, Rosen (1982) found that only half of the people in a self-help program completed the work. Those who stuck with it got good results (overcoming their fears). Similar results have been found in toilet training of children and self-administered treatment for premature ejaculation. Likewise, Schindler (1979) reported that only 17 of 60 subjects made full use of an assertiveness book. What determines these vast differences in motivation among us? Why are some of us fantastic achievers while others take the easy route? We don't know for sure (but see learned industriousness later), but having explicit goals and certain attitudes help.

&gt;Life goals set our sails and give us a push, healthier and less stressed or emotional. However, there seem to be certain life goals that harm our mental health, e.g. ""I want to have the power to control or impress people."" Wanting to be close to and good to others is associated with better emotional health (National Advisory Mental Health Council, 1995). Likewise, seeking to improve your skills (""mastery goals"") results in feeling good about trying hard and in increased effort when an obstacle is met. But wanting to beat others (""performance goals""), such as having a winning season in football or being the best student in your math class, giving up when starting to lose

&gt;In any area where we are hoping to self-improve, you should explicitly describe your goals in terms of very specific behaviors. Danish, Petitpas &amp; Hale (1995) provide examples of specific behaviors in sports psychology:

&gt;Physical skills--""I'll do 3 more sit ups and 3 more push ups this week than I did last week."" Cognitive skills--""I'll develop some self-talk that should reduce my fears and improve my batting."" · Gain knowledge--""I'll learn more about exercising to prevent my back from hurting."" · Courage--""I'll practice batting against a very fast pitcher for two weeks

&gt;Positive objectives are usually more motivating than negative ones, not something imposed on you. Mastery-oriented people, realizing success depends on their skills, become more selfdirected, work harder, achieve a higher level of performance, and get more enjoyment out of the activity. In contrast, ""performance""-oriented people are more likely to strive for attention and view beating others as a ""life or death"" matter (in this case

&gt;Challenging-but-achievable goals are themselves motivating. On the other hand, you can achieve it"" nonsense). Since challenging but realistic goals require us to stretch and grow, they must constantly be changed to match the conditions and our ability. We are most motivated when we feel capable, responsible, self-directed, respected, and hopeful.

&gt;As discussed in attribution theory later, an optimistic, high achieving student may seek out friends who value and reinforce his/her successes in school, he/she frequently re-lives in fantasy his/her past accomplishments and dreams of the future, and he/she may relax with friends before an exam. This is called ""illusory glow"" optimism because such a person nurtures and protects his/her selfesteem and confidence. They expect to do very well, they work very hard, they enjoy their successes, if they should fail

&gt;On the other hand, at least, anticipates a variety of possible stumbling blocks. He/she works very hard, preparing especially well for the anticipated difficulties. He/she uses the high test anxiety and stress as motivators, not as something to avoid, and then takes an ""I expected it"" attitude towards the rare failure that does occur (and with anxious excitement systematically attacks the next challenge). This strategy is very different from the pessimistic student who ""bad mouths"" him/herself after a failure: ""I'm such an idiot,"" ""I'm so lazy, and perform more and more poorly until eventually becoming a total pessimist who has no hope,,1349998548.0

[Part 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/10jkkd/my_thoughts_on_the_economics_of_discipline_long/)

Part 2: Willpower, and discipline

So let’s say you wake up one morning and you have no energy and no motivation.  Ack!  This means all of your buyers decided to stay indoors today

But what if you have a job interview or a test right now!  These huge businesses are in town today

That’s when you call in the emergency team – these are your police or firefighter departments.  Yes

What do the police and firefighters represent? Your attention.  Well, all under your employ.  Everyday you send various government workers to various places – help repair the vehicles and keep them maintained, or help set up the marketplace so that the businesses can start doing business in the morning.  

So on that important test or interview day when you have no energy (buyers)

Of course, I know you want to stay home and sleep, but if we want to keep the economy alive, you’re gonna HAVE to come out.”  

So how do you have enough money to pay these policemen?  

You’re going to need *money*.  And that’s what willpower represents - willpower is the amount of money your government has to spend on the various sectors of the economy.  The more willpower you have

The only problem is you only have a limited supply of willpower.  Willpower is different than energy and motivation (your buyers).  Willpower does not regenerate every day.  In fact

Without willpower, you won’t have that emergency task force waiting at the ready to bring your buyers to the market.

So now you’re asking, how do I get more?”  

That’s what brings us to the most difficult part of this entire equation:

Taxes.  

You’re going have to tax the hell out of the participants in your economy if you want to maintain your bank of willpower.

But the key is to tax smartly, the former.  You want LESS of those transactions happening, and more of the latter (subsidize that shit).

No one likes taxes.  When you tax something, and you’ll lose all your willpower.  

But how exactly *do* you tax those not-so-good transactions and vendors who are damaging your economy?  

The answer is discomfort.

Yep

But realize this: without discomfort, you will never feel that sense of incongruency that “pushes” you into reaching for more.

The more uncomfortable you are, you can choose – do you tax it a lot, or do you tax it only a little?  

I say

And so by feeling uncomfortable, you’re going to add to your own willpower.  Think of all the times when you indulged like crazy, and then the next day you thought “shit, today I HAVE to get something done.”

At the same time, but don’t feel too comfortable – you still have a lot more to do.  Every time you feel comfortable about your life, your willpower will not increase, and will get depleted quickly.  

So maintain your levels of willpower (money) by constantly feeling discomfort about your current situation.  That way, they’ll be well-able to deal with it.  

Of course, when we’re getting so little benefits from this idiot government?”  

That’s when you have all kinds of these fucked up situations like depression, where you have no businesses willing to open shop.  If you’re TOO uncomfortable with yourself, you might just end up destroying everything.  

So

I am stuck in this endless cycle. I have observed, and why I seem to consistantly make the same stupid decisions time after time, even when I know better. Let me break down to you day by day how my life seems to folding out every week so far in this semester.

* **Monday** - Usually had a really good weekend before, when I wake up Monday morning, I'm tired and not looking forward to another 5 days of work. So what do I do? I decide to first check my Gmail, then my Facebook, then Youtube, Reddit etc, instead of just starting  studying. This seemly, innocent procrastination quickly spirals into a full blown day wasted by procrastinating, it is so hard to stop

* **Tuesday** - Disgusted by the disgusting way I acted/lived on Monday, watch what I eat, and even often catch up with friends nearing the end of the day. Overall a really great day that I wouldnt mind copying &amp; pasting to every day of the week.

* **Wednesday** - Wednesday rolls around I am still on a bit of a roll from Tuesday being such a great &amp; productive day! I get to work almost on time, I start procrastinating a tiny bit by tiny bit, each time I reigning myself in, but I start to feel my willpower drain away.

* **Thursday &amp; Friday** - And then there is Thursday followed by Friday. Both days seem to be a lot like doing sprints. I will do a good amount of work, with the occasional catching up with friends.

* **Saturday &amp; Sunday** - Finally the weekend has arrived, the joy of living, has arrived with it. Even though my mind is constantly being nagged by the thought of all the work I need to catch up on due to my procrastinating through the week, I still manage to have a blast of the weekend, really enjoying myself &amp; getting out a lot. You feel alive, and suddenly all the problems that weighed you down throughout the week seem so flexible  However the worst thing is that at the end of every week, I come to a point where I promise to myself that the week is going to be my 'bitch' (sorry if annoying takes offense, and that I am going to  own it and not repeat the mistakes of the week just ending. Sadly though


Rinse &amp; Repeat. So this has been happening for almost 5 weeks now, once again, failure of today, as I am writing this.

I know that I just have to decide not to do it. I know that I need to make sure I don't turn on my computer first thing on Monday, and that it is becoming easier for me to make the same mistakes, fall in the same rut,  week by week.

Sure some of you are going to just say “Just DO IT” or “Just DON'T DO IT”. In theory that is true

Or maybe I am just looking at this all wrong. Maybe somewhere there is something that I have missed, discipline &amp; motivation will be the only things that will help get my crap together. There is no single answer tip or trick that will stop my procrastination and its nasty repercussions in my habits – only willpower....... Sadly, willpower seems to be like an emotion for me, it's here one day, then it floats away the next.

I, Facebook, Youtube, etc. as you want, while still not letting those sites waste away your life. The method is still in a very rough shape, and I give you no guarantees that it will work. It needs a lot of further work and beta-testing, but I hope that you will find it useful and that you can help me with its further development. 

I will next describe the practice and then try to explain where it comes from and the principles behind it. It applies only if you spend a lot of time browsing using a computer and a mouse. When you browse on your phone or tablet you will have to come up with some appropriate alternative.

This is step 1 of the practice (that is all I have so far). It is as follows: Every time you touch the mouse with your hand you note in your mind **touching**, when you scroll - **scrolling** and when you click - **clicking**. You do this *always*, regardless of whether you are working on your computer, or just having fun. If it is too difficult at first, then you can say those words out loud, but only at the beginning. It will get easier as you keep practicing.

This method is based on a certain Buddhist meditation practice developed by the Burmese monk [Mahasi Sayadaw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahasi_Sayadaw). You can read more about the practice [here](http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/mahasit1.pdf). I learned it on a meditation retreat that I visited one year ago. There we were supposed to note in our mind every action that we do throughout the day and do this with as much detail as we can. 

So why should this work? I find that certain activities make my mind get into some kind of a auto-pilot mode. Such activities include computer browsing, reading engrossing books, daydreaming etc. When I get into auto-pilot mode, I lose control, while my automatic habitual behavior takes over. I lose track of time. When I finally get out of it, I feel as I have woken up from some sort of a dream-like state.

The purpose of the practice I described above is to prevent getting into auto-pilot mode. You remain fully conscious while browsing Reddit, etc. As you continue practicing you will see that your mind becomes sharper, and that the resolution with which you perceive the world and your own actions greatly increases. You start noticing your cravings as they arise. As you see them, you will get the ability to decide *rationally* whether you should follow them, or not. When a person is rational, they do not do anything that would lead to their own harm. So when you decide that browsing Reddit is harmful, and that you should write your homework instead, with very little effort and with practically no resistance. The only negative side is that if you practice diligently

I hope this helps you. As I said this method needs a lot of further work. For example it might make sense as a step 2 of the practice, which would be steps 3,4 and so on, one might add **watching** (a Youtube clip), **reading**(a Reddit post), **wanting** (to click on a link, to write a comment, **intending**(to do what you wanted to do) and so on.

So a little backstory here, doing homework socializing, life was good. I had a fairly early midterm in one of my classes, which was a prerequisite to a certificate I really really wanted to do... And I bombed.

And from then on the spiral begins, like for 5 days straight and pretty much ignored the other midterm for another class on the next day because I was doing fine in that class. And I pretty much got the same score on the second midterm.

This is when the bad stuff begins, and I know i studied harder than anyone I knew in that class. After this point I pretty much went into a hole, staying on my computer all day just playing games and not doing work or going to class because I was so disheartened with everything in school. This whole spiral has continued for the rest of the quarter (I am on the quarter system instead of semester) and I don't like myself like this, I really don't but I honestly have no idea how to pick myself back up. Before I was a healthy guy who enjoyed going to the gym and socializing and being there for my friends and being successful in all my classes (I had a 3.6 GPA but lets see what I get after this quarter) while still being an avid gamer. Now I am an unhealthy, chubby, lazy guy who sits in his room playing video games and not seeing any of his friends. I need to change and I want to change and I want to pull myself back together. I am basically reverting back to my old ways before I lost all my weight and changed myself immensely. I was obese, lazy, sat all day on my computer and just a plain slob.

1351858822.0,12ie6q,(first post) Seeking advice on building good habits/discipline while chronically ill/in chronic pain,candlesandfish,15,0,8,"Hi all

I've been trying for years and years to get everything together and get things done, if other people drive me (and I'm careful) and on the odd occasion my health will let me do the things I want to). I'm 24.

I've got ME/CFS - Myalgic Encephalomyelitis, and my energy levels are limited, as well as waking up with inflamed nerves everywhere pretty much every day. This adds an extra dimension to the 'I don't want to get out of bed' that I have to fight. Bonus points for the fact that I usually feel better once I get up, get moving, and my brain is distracted from the pain, which doesn't go away but is just backgrounded. Logically I know I should get up, but I am literally fighting my body's screams of GO BACK TO SLEEP AND DON'T MOVE BECAUSE THEN IT DOESN'T HURT. And then I finally do get up and try to do things.

It's very easy, although not necessarily *in* bed - I can make the bed and sit/lie on top of it and do things. If I am careful, I can do things like cook, sew (I make my own clothes a bit), stitch (almost all chronically ill people pick a handicraft to stop us going nuts, embroidery is mine), read or do some work or even cleaning/tidying

I'm looking for advice on how to get progress done on certain activities (especially if I can apply it to new things as well when they come along) given my limitations - it's not just a case of convincing myself to get up in the morning or 'just do it'. I *am* capable of achieving SOMETHING though

I figure you guys have done the motivational stuff I've been trying for ages

Here are the things I'd really like to start doing:

- getting dressed every day (being an invalid and not having to go out of the house means I often don't get out of my pyjamas for a day or so)

- saying AM &amp; PM prayers (I'm Eastern Orthodox Christian (Greek Orthodox etc) and we have a set practice of prayers, PM 15min, and mostly I'm just lazy/unmotivated/feeling like a zombie)

- getting something done towards each of my goals each day

goals:

- cleaning/tidying my room - there are piles, books (although this is slightly better now that I've acquired a second bookshelf), a giant mound of worn-once-but-not-dirty clothing, boxes, a box of stuff I cleared off my dresser which is miscellaneous, as well as other Misc stuff. It needs to not be on my floor, and stay off my floor! 

- get back into cooking - I love to cook, since one of my parents usually will, but it would be nice if I did. Even if it's cookies, or cake, or marmalade. Bonus points if it's dinner.

- get through my 'to be read' list

- get something done on a paper for college that was due in may but I have medical extensions for. It's now got so far out from semester that despite my acquiring books

mini-goals: 

- finishing cutting (almost done) and then sew up a dress that's currently on our living room couch (cutting: 1 hour

- sew dress #2 that I have fabric for (cutting: 1 hour

- finish sewing a pair of pants that have been half done for about a month

I left school at 16 (normal age for the UK) with pretty decent grades (11 GCSEs grade A-C) but then it all went downhill from there. I went to college but I felt like I had no direction and I didn't know what to do with my life.

1373980177.0,1iesn1,Make it hard to be lazy,,15,1,4,"This seems like a really simple thing to do but it's really helped me a lot. 

For example
 
If I want to get past this, I sometimes get the code wrong a few times and it is immensely frustrating. 

One of the reasons why I spend so much time on the internet is because of laziness. I don't have to spend any effort at all and I'm addicted to instant gratification. The effort to reward ratio is extremely high. Essentially, it is often just easier to pick up a book and read it. Rather than waiting 10 minutes to access more sites, I might want to do something else and completely forget about the (usually trite) thing I've been looking at. **The productive option becomes the lazier option**. My laziness is turned into a form of discipline. If I see myself becoming more disciplined/less lazy in the future, I will still be doing the same things.
It also reminds me that what I'm planning to do is something I don't really want to do on an intellectual level so it's harder to fall into that trap where you lose hours and gain nothing. 

Some other stuff I do is to put my laptop in a small cardboard box and fill it with books. Close it

I used to wake up and go on my laptop straight away but that doesn't really happen any more. As someone who used to spend hours on the internet each day

There are still times where I binge on the internet but not as much and I'm hoping that this system will generally still work. There are some things I still need to work through with this but I'm pretty hopeful about it; It's something that's worked for me when so many other systems haven't. The main problem is 'forgetting' to put my laptop back once I've done everything that I needed to do or reactivating IE/disabling leechblock because I really want to continue reading just one thing and I swear I'll come off it as soon as I've seen it

I'm sure you can find ways to apply this to your own problems. For example, maybe change your password to some ridiculously long randomly generated character sequence, write it down on a piece of paper and put it somewhere where you have to physically get up and go looking for it. If you want to get extreme, write different parts of the password on different pieces of paper and separate them. Of course this runs the risk of you losing the password forever.

It seems to me that I have a choice. I could simply strive to spend as much time as possible working on my projects, then I can still reward myself afterwards. 

However, results are the only thing that actually matter. If I work for six hours straight, but accomplish nothing, that time is wasted. Hopefully, tomorrow I can be more productive. Additionally, with this ideology, if I am tired and have a lot on my mind and I do not believe that working will be productive at this point in time, because I probably wouldn't have achieved much anyway.

**Arguments in favor of taking the TIME approach:**

* Variations on ""skill is simply a direct result of sheer amount of time working on said skill"". E.g. ""practice, ""if you want to be a good artist, draw all the time"", ""stop wasting your time reading tutorials on how to paint and just PAINT"", the 10,000 hours idea. 
* It leads to less stress and takes less willpower to tell myself ""just sit down and work for two hours
* Not working because I feel like I'm in an unproductive state is just a poor excuse. If I really want to achieve results, don't feel like it, etc. There will never be a time when I can't think of some excuse not to work, so doing this will end up with me basically never working. 
* Oftentimes it simply cannot be helped that a project requires lots of time before noticeable results are achieved. If I don't allow myself to spend four hours working and have nothing to show of it, I'll feel guilty for not achieving as much as I feel like I should have a lot because of the planning fallacy. I will end up 
* Allowing myself to ""loosen up"" and not constantly worry about the fastest way to achieve results might result in more creative outcomes. 
* If I were following the results approach and I were, I would probably put less care into each one than I would if I were to tell myself that I will spend ten hours drawing and be happy with however many I make. This seems like it would lead to a) an inferior product and b) stagnation, because I would not have the focus and attention to detail that is required to improve my drawing skills. 

**Arguments in favor of taking the RESULTS approach:**

* While it is true that pretty much anyone spending massive amounts of time working on something will eventually become good at it, for example, has stated that he hasn't improved at art at all the whole time the comic has been running, despite spending like 4 hours a day drawing, simply because he's been focusing on improving at storytelling and humor instead. Believing in ""10,000 hours"" truisms on blind faith seems silly. 
* If I can focus on achieving meaningful
* It's silly to spend time working when I'm tired, and then I'll feel bad. It would be much better for my mental health if I simply watched TV when I felt tired, and the boost in happiness would more than offset the small drop in productivity. Plus, I've seen a lot of material that claims ""80% of your progress comes from 20% of your time"", ""you need to work smarter, not harder"", ""working less can actually boost productivity""
* If I regularly allow myself to spend four hours working and have nothing to show for it, doodling and ""thinking"" for long periods of time)

As you can see, but then again, not necessarily. Perhaps I can find some sort of compromise that takes advantage of the benefits of both approaches as much as possible, while also minimizing the downsides of each. 

So what do you guys use? Is there any good literature on the subject? Is time or results motivation more likely to put you/people in a state of flow? Is there a good way to combine the two?

I want to describe a modification of the chain/Seinfield method for learning a new habit. I have been practicing it for about two months and so far it seems to work.

The chain method is as follows: You mark on your calendar every day when you do activity X. After some time a chain forms. Then your goal is not to break the chain. 

Unfortunately for me, ""It's no big deal that you didn't do X today, you have done it for so long already."" But then I break the chain again and again, and eventually I realize that I haven't done X for weeks.

So this is where the modification comes in. You pick a sum of money **S**. This sum should be small enough so that you can still live comfortably after spending **4*S** each month,W*S)**, where **W** is the number of whole weeks that you have managed to keep the chain since your last relapse.

The post is about how you can only achieve goals efficiently and effectively but most important

**1. What do you want to achieve from this?** Well you want motivation, what If I don't want to post a picture anymore? Where the hell do you go? I suggest you go to /r/GetDisciplined GM is for wolves, you come here, we'll kick your spartan ass and turn your profession into a warrior. Now back to the main point, what do you do after all this? You got the motivation the discipline, was it worth it? Yes maybe, no for some but it will be trust me. Just set up a goal, finish college, the most important part of setting up goals is the small ones, wash dishes

**2. How do I do it?** If you read the post on the link in the earlier parts even if it's just tl;dr he included then you have a good idea how to do it.  But if you don't, clothing, bathing and many more. How did develop them? through time? Yes, but I assure you, you got those habits within the first 30days of doing it. Same concept goes for quitting gaming/smoking/drinking. Stop for a day, you'll crave. Continue for a week, you'll urge. Finish a month, you'll make the rest of your successful life count. tic toc mate.

**3. Track your progress.** Well I'll feel bad if I'm working my ass off and I don't see results. But do I ever give up? Nope. The term ""giving up"" is something other people say. Up to this point you are now a warrior. A shining shimmering, No surrender. That is Spartan law.""
You see? That is one bad-ass quote. And there's a scene in the movie where they kill some Persian and make walls out of its corpses, you making those corpse walls are your habits, moving closer and closer to Xerxes is your progress. Xerxes is your long term goal. But that slimy fucking hunchback spartan traitor is your demotivator, he will make you weak and ultimately defeat you. King Leonidas showed him mercy and spared his life and little did he know that It would be the same reason that would kill him and his men. But nooo, you won't do that wont you? Don't back down even if you get demotivated. You fall hard, you fight. You get up, you fight. You don't give up. There is a thin line between the difference between death and defeat. Death is when you quit

**4. When you finish your goals, he almost finished that 5k in record time and he almost finished his goals. Hey, that was the goal in the first place. To run, you didn't exactly surpass those goals or accomplished them as planned but hey, I told you in the first place, I'll teach you how to run for those goals. And my ohh my, here you are running for them. Awesome. Now let's get flying, well If you wanna reach your goals further then you should put more effort into it! If you already reached you goals then damn it, you can do anything. That's the secret. Men have asked questions before that they found the answers to themselves and they searched for it. Socrates didn't have the internet. They strives to be better

You sit in front of the computer

Suddenly someone interrupts you

Worse

You look back at the day with mixed feelings. Sometimes you justify that you were productive or sometimes feel awful. 

---------

Our brains and bodies are wired to seek comfort. 

Exercise is uncomfortable

Creative or Important work is uncomfortable

Standing up for something you believe if uncomfortable

Seeking comfort is the default state of the mind. It will make you physically and intellectually lazy and bring untold misery if you let it. 

Seeking comfort -&gt; Gratification now

Enduring discomfort and pain -&gt; Smile of satisfaction now

--------------

**What really happened inside the brain?**

Whenever we find something difficult or uncomfortable

**How does the urges help us?**

This default state of mind worked very well in the hunterer-gatherer society. It helped us avoid wild animals

But

We still feel uncomfortable doing certain kinds of work because of any of the following : 

* it is hard and you don't know whether it is the right way
* we lack skills
* the fear of what others will say about our work
* any reason you can think of

It is good to have fear, creative work etc. 

**What is the connection between urges and productivity?**

Everyday you get a finite amount of time - 24 hours and a finite amount of willpower. 

The willpower gets depleted during the day. And is at its weakest when you are tired or sleep deprived. 

If you are on an internet binge in the late hours of night

On the other hand

----------------------

**How to deplete willpower as fast as possible?**

* Avoid the work that is important. 
* Seek out what's new on social networks like facebook or reddit. Distractions are a very good way to deplete willpower. 
* Consume lots of food. Since a major part of your body energy is spent on digesting food
* Consume lots of information. Your brain will be entertained and stimulated by all the TV shows or youtube that you watch. You need more and more dopamine to trigger the same feeling of satisfaction in your brain. You have to spend more and more time each day. 
* Don't block uninterrupted times of day for completing the important assignments. They will be done when they are done. Then you can waste your finite willpower doing unimportant tasks. 
* Watch advertisements

------------------------

**How to increase willpower?**

Good sleep

Good sleep - Being tired and sleep deprived reduces your willpower and you give in to urges more easily. Good sleep refreshes you mentally and physically. 

Exercise - Exercise make you more energetic

Meditation - For a given period of time, emotions and sensations and do not react. You get better at watching the urges and observing them. You are building a counter habit to the natural comfort seeking one. Personally I do [Vipassana](http://www.dhamma.org/) meditation. 

The counter-habit of observing urges and not reacting helps to conserve the willpower. But you are not 100% perfect when you start the habit of meditation. So willpower will still get depleted

Please Note : The willpower will still get depleted during the day as you do work

**How to be more productive

* Schedule your most important work in the mornings. Block a 2 hour or 3 hour time chunk without any distractions or interruptions or email or internet (if possible) and *complete* it. Do not cave in to your primitive mind despite what it says. 

* Congratulate yourself if you take action once on the above point. Now make it a point to do it every single day. 

* Similarly block chunks of time to do other important tasks and don't get distracted. By the way

* Whenever you make a decision to do something, estimate hours and block your calendar.

* Resist watching TV or advertisement boards or youtube videos till the evening. These are designed to tempt us and distract us. Advertising is the art and science of tempting

A big thanks for reading so far

* [Vipassana](http://www.dhamma.org/) meditation - I personally practice it and have good results
* [Eat the Frog](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1576754227/) - Brian Tracy

------------------

tldr; 

Some of my notes while reading the Willpower Instinct - 

What helps build up  willpower -

1. Meditation

2. Good Sleep - 7 to 8 hours a day

3. Not fighting or avoiding negative thoughts or behaviours

4. Surfing the urge

5. Replace habits

6. Understand dopamine addiction

7. Reverse dopamine strategy
 The 10-minute strategy of doing something or not giving in to your craving.

8. Pre-commitment - Sometimes it is good to burn the ships and keep fighting.

9. Social Proof - If more people are doing it you tend to do it too. Find out groups of people who are doing what you would like to do. 

10. When trying to form the target behaviour and escaping the undesirable one

1) Stop watching Television. I never really used to ""watch"" TV, the same old shows, the same jokes, over and over again. Turn it off.

- Something good that has come from doing it. It no longer prevents my mind from wandering, more motivated to do something. The days a longer, especially when I don't have to work. The Earth is pretty loud once you start listening to it.

2) Stop with the Porn. I'm sure this has been said before but it's pretty bad... /r/NoFap is in the sidebar. This is something that takes a bit of brain power

- Good things to come from this. In addition to the television being off, this meant more sex, but also there wasn't pressure to have sex in a particular time bracket between two shows or before a show or after a show or before the game etc etc. 

3) Stand. Up. Straight. Take a good look at your posture in the mirror! Mine is terrible

- Good things to come from this? One word, take pride in yourself and stand tall. I've gained probably 2.5-3 INCHES in height just by standing up straight.

I think of it a lot like fighting. I probably relate a lot of things to combat because I know a lot of boxing, sometimes you do plateau, but that is really just an illusion as you are actually getting better but at a much slower rate. If you stop training, you start getting worse.

The same thing can be said for discipline. It's something I work at, invent my own systems etc... Now I'm a fairly goal oriented guy, and I've achieved success in many different areas of my life, but being disciplined is STILL a daily struggle for me. 

There are still days where I catch myself just blowing the whole day watching TV. Yeah

**Tip 1: Write it DOWN!**

Buy a small notebook/journal and note down your thoughts, I didn't believe that writing down ideas, thoughts and day planners would help me. It just seemed that I am going to waste my time writing down stuff when I can just do stuff. But in the past 7 days, I've entered in a journal entry everyday and made a day plannar for tomorrow the night before, every. day. By writing something down, you get it out of your mind and onto paper. It gives a great feel of ""getting it off your chest."" I would recommend that if you are trying to get disciplined, buy a small notebook and start entering journal entries and making to-do lists.


*What to write down in your Notebook/Journal*

* Write down 5 things that you liked and 5 things you didn't like in your day (EVERYDAY). It is very important that you are honest with yourself because lying to yourself isn't a good way to start getting disciplined. For example, write it down. If you helped a stranger, write it down.
* Write down what you are going to do tomorrow, and C - for least important tasks. The key is to complete at least **ONE** task each day for 7 days. Then two tasks each day for the next 7 days and so on. However, never start a B task if you an A task and never start a C task if you have a B task. I've been doing this for the past 7 days and it helps a lot. This way you can finish important tasks, instead of finishing easy tasks and feeling like you did a lot in a day, when really you just did few easy tasks here and there. In my experience, the first few days, I completed only 1 task a day but the feeling of ""getting it done"" made me want to do more tasks. So I began doing 2-3 task in a day. When you complete a task, I get this great feeling of success and always get a great smile on my face and immediately want to begin my next task. Lastly
* You can also write down whatever you feel you need to talk about. 
* (Optional) Also you can write down the **Goal Of The Day**. Underneath the task list



Now I am *no* expert at this by only going at for 7 days

All of these supplements out there are exactly that, healthy

 
The supplement industry has a very aggressive marketing strategy, the guys or gals with the physique of a Greek God. They lead you to believe that if you take product x, y, or z then you too will look like that. What they fail to include is that this model has busted their ass day in and day out, taking who knows what, or even going completely natural in the gym to get their body. It wasn’t the product they are endorsing, it was their hard work and lifting the weights that got them into that photo shoot, it really doesn’t matter - the body of the model was made in the gym

 
There are a few reasons to supplement that I agree with. Taking a pill to make up for a deficiency you can’t get elsewhere is one of them. My wife hates fish, and that was a battle I was not going to win. During my deployments to the Middle East we all would take some form of supplementation due to the fact that the food we consumed was horrendous, and I’m pretty sure not fit for human consumption. So supplementation is sometimes necessary, but to think for a second that by taking Hydroxycut, your fat is going to melt away and your Abdominal muscles will miraculously appear is absurd.

 
Get in the gym and do the work, Deadlifts, KettleBell, and Pull ups, these things are not always on the top of your ‘I want to do’ list. This mentality will create a disciplined mind that gets stronger every time you exercise it. By making your brain get you into the gym when it can come up with a hundred reasons as to why you should just sit down and watch Dexter or Homeland is not an easy task. Just like working out is not an easy task, but in the same way that your body will improve aesthetically and with more power capacity, so will your mind. As your physique starts to come together

 
If you were to take the surgery route you bypass this entire step of training the mind. While you may have an external improvement

 
We only have one life and one body, Friends, and Family.

i keep playing the game and i notice that the time it takes me to press the restart button is shortening
And I noticed that after I stopped playing I was more edgy and even couldn't finish reading a short article.
so it made me think if i can't stand the frustration in a 60 sec games how can i stand the frustration of trying to accomplish work\projects done(and in that point i couldn't).


so i kept my old challenge of trying to reach ""amazing speed"" as often as possible and a new challenge


i couldn't believe how frustrating it will be to not hit the restart button, and that's something I rarely do.
only when we have to confront how we feel and try to pass that frustrating  feeling/adjust that feeling can we approach more daunting task. 


I've gotten better at not stopping in the middle(in Bejeweled haven't stopped for a couple of months)  and am more able to confront frustration . I still play Bejeweled blitz but a lot less
one more thing i am able to decided **i will play only 1 or 2 games** and than stop.
that is a big thing for me

Since than I decided to find a more challenging game 
I'm trying a game called dominion(based on the cards game).
And it's 1 vs 1 so I hope I will see how it goes.


Now a disclaimer: I still procrastinate
In the beginning the game might consume your time and it will seem like you are moving backward in your goal to be more disciplined, tips and is this method even any good for other people? 


 My belief is it can help build **FRUSTRATION STAMINA** witch is important in finishing tasks and not giving up in the middle of them.



So I’m going to give some more specifics for those who try it:

1) Decide a game that will be your challenge

2) First time you try it the game has to be short(60 sec -5 min).
Tetris

3) First time: the game can't be you vs other player but you vs the game

4) Better to have more than 1 challenge(some mid game challenge like”amazing speed”).

5) YOU START A GAME

6)notice how you feel



if you are able to play with out quitting in the middle when you are losing 

in the beginning try to decide i will play only 1 more game or 2 more. and quit playing even if it will be just 5 min .
my suggestion add this only after you are able to handle you frustration.




**TL;DR**: start playing a game and challenge yourself to finish it no matter how frustrating you feel.




edit: grammar/formatting.

added rule 6 cause it seems the main reason to play wasn't clear enough.

added something i forgot to add about being able to decide how much to play.

During my time at university and subsequently my first year working at a company, and the Bill and Melinda Gates foundation, as well as many smaller things. I fell in love with the idea of using my life to help improve education where I grew up.

During the same period, I am alone and striving to make games that will be played alone. The whole reason I loved them in the first place was the shared communal experience and friendship. How fucked up is that?

The thing is, and the next most time consuming thing is time wasting internet habits, mostly browsing Reddit and Twitter. My personal life feels completely out of balance. Every day, I long to be part of some sort of group doing interesting work. I long to be with my friends again to share experiences with them, but we are all scattered to the wind. I have returned to my incredible levels of insecurity and shyness that I had at the start of college, and I feel helpless to change my situation even though I know I'm not. If I didn't go for daily walks and coffee breaks, I'd probably lose my mind. I'm crunching on a game I don't really care about

As a fix, I read helpful subs like this one and /Getmotivated and some days, I feel genuinely like I've got it all figured out. Then, I descend in to mental chaos again the next day, feeling like I've received feedback from way to many incidental sources of information. An ideology I picked up in Jiro Dreams of Sushi conflicts with a podcast I listened to, all the while messing with some thoughts I encountered while reading the Steve Job's biography. There is no one to bounce my ideas off of, to test my beliefs with

Whenever I try to talk to my girlfriend or family about it, and like I've lost my voice. I need to change this situation, I need to use my body and be with people I love and I need to help the world be a better place than I found it.

For every good, my accomplishments don't seem real. I'm just firing them off in to the digital ether to be liked and @'d on twitter and tumblr.

One thing I noticed about myself is that I'm awful at keeping on top of things in the summer.

 During the school year (I'm in college), to clean, to take a nap, to go to class, to do my homework, to study, to exercise, and be with friends without any problem. 

Here's the situation. It's summer now. I'm moping around and normally, or associate with the fellas over at /r/trees, if you get what I'm saying.

However, drinking, or smoking. It makes me feel lazy and unproductive. I sold my PS3 and I might play a game on the computer for 15 minutes, but then I'll get bored of it, I cut back on drinking a whole lot, I MIGHT have a couple drinks if my friends are out getting completely shit faced, and I've cut out smoking 100%

I want to make more of myself and do things that I want to do to better my life

So what I'm asking all of you at /r/getdisciplined to help put together a schedule for me. What I'm looking for is at this specific time: Wake up. At this specific time until this specific time: Go to the track. Something I noticed that also helps is challenges.

-Cleaning the house

-Exercise (I run at my local track and do smaller work outs at my house)

-Do personal development

-Learn Guitar (I love music so much

I'd wake up every morning and think ""what kind of fun is going to happen today?"" and I'd have fun doing everything, and go for hikes every day. I could go up to anyone and have an amazing conversation as well. As I like to put it, I was glowing. I've been like this before that, and I always seem to shrink back to baseline a couple months after achieving a major accomplishment.

1372872075.0,1hktyd,Measuring your goals...? Join me...,OnlineCourage,12,1,13,"I just found this subreddit today while searching for an online support group for people who want to wake up early.  First off

The human race is bound together by the common struggles within our own minds in regards to emotional problems, exercising or other problems.  For me personally, I have had trouble motivating myself to consistently get up early over time - for around 10 years.  

On the other hand, harsh temperatures where the clothes around my face are full of ice at the end - no problem.  I have consistently been able to finish in the top 2% of any fun race or athletic event that I have run since 2007, and I am slowly trending upward in performance despite the fact that I am now older (30) and should theoretically be in less shape than in my early 20's.

Because of this

Now - what I would like to do next is conquer my inability to get up early.  This is something that I just started tracking on my spreadsheets at the beginning of this year.  I have still not gotten the hang of it.  My original goal was to try to get up at 4AM every week day.  I call this

So anyway - I was able to pull a Tim Cook sporadically over time but never with any consistency worth mentioning.  More recently

What I would like to do, it's more about what works for you and then sticking to that goal] 4) why you think you can reach your goal consistently, as close to 100% as possible, but at least 80% 5) why you can be trusted to fill out your cells honestly with the time that you got up

This spreadsheet will be a dictatorship with me as the controller/leader.  There will be no collaborative system with a board that votes on how it is run.  You can always keep a backup copy of your data on another sheet and start your own sheet.  Why?  Because this is the only way to maintain order and discipline for those who really consider it an important part of their life.  I promise to you that I will maintain the spreadsheet and kick out other members who are not consistently collaborating and updating their wake-up times and are going inactive: that will be the benefit for you to join my spreadsheet - no one will be dragging you down and you can rest assured that it is a serious exercise.

I also received the grades for this semester

Today's primary goal is to continue working with the list of goals I created yesterday. I will consolidate similar goals


**The initial goal list:**

* Create a video game I'm proud of
* Have success selling a video game
* Have enough money to live comfortably and not worry about the price of food
* Make my father proud of me
* Read at least 4 books a month
* Get fit
* Lose the stomach
* Maintain an exercise schedule
* Hold a job
* Make people happy
* Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable
* Maintain a stable body shape
* Have nice clothes
* Able to retire at 40
* Have a job I don't want to retire from
* Get off welfare
* Become a productive person
* Don't live a life of mere existence.


**Consolidated:**

**Work:**

* Create and successfully sell a video game I'm proud of. 
* Make people happy.
* Able to retire at 40

**Mental:**

* Read at least 4 books a month.
* Become a productive person such that I will not live a life of mere existence.

**Physical:**

* Maintain an exercise schedule

**Material:**

* Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable.
* Have nice clothes.
* Get off welfare

That's not too bad. Now I will need to rate each goal on how much it will improve my life. I will be using a rating system in which I assign each goal a value from 1 to 9, 9 being very helpful to my life.

**Rated:**

**Work:**

* 9 - Create and successfully sell a video game I'm proud of. 
* 7 - Make people happy.
* 7 - Able to retire at 40

**Mental:**

* 8 - Become a productive person such that I will not live a life of mere existence.
* 6 - Read at least 4 books a month.

**Physical:**

* 9 - Maintain an exercise schedule

**Material:**

* 9 - Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable.
* 8 - Get off welfare
* 5 - Have nice clothes.


It seems I did a fairly good job picking helpful goals. Because I want to focus on improvement, along with some new goals. These will be used as a metric to monitor my progress, but may not necessarily be things I strongly desire. Speaking of metrics, before we turn these into projects, let's make these goals a little more specific. If I'm going to be measuring my progress, I need to know what I'm measuring to.


**Specified:**

**Work:**

* 9 - Create and successfully sell a video game I'm proud of
* 7 - Make people happy. Get positive feedback from my video game from at least 5 different sources.
* 7 - Able to retire at 40

**Mental:**

* 8 - Become a productive person such that I will not live a life of mere existence. How the hell do I quantify this?
* 6 - Read at least 4 books a month.

**Physical:**

* 9 - Maintain an exercise schedule. Exercise at least 4 times a week.

**Material:**

* 9 - Own a house where I'm far enough away from people to be comfortable to not hear their daily activities. 
* 8 - Get off welfare

That's not perfect

**Projectified:**

**Work:**

* Make a video game

**Mental:**

* Be productive during the hours of 8 am and 4 pm.
* Read

**Physical:**

* Exercise

**Material:**

* Don't spend frivolously.

It seems that to accomplish my goals, **read**, and **exercise**. I should be sure to do one of those things **during the hours of 8 am and 4 pm**, and when I earn money, I **don't spend frivolously**. That almost sounds simple. It probably is simple, but it is difficult as well. I have to make a video game I like that sells. That's no easy task. Yet, this process has made it very clear of what activities I need to perform to fulfill these goals.

My recovery was going well beyond what others expected. With medication and my dedication to improve my life and make up for the last few years that I lost






Prior to this diagnosis (January-March 2012)

For the remainder of the semester my marks had gone from the low 50's to the mid 80's. So I came back to high school for another semester

This year

After that semester, but also learn new skills and education on my own. In the short time, I've managed to become fluent in French, while still learning Spanish and German. I've started to learn coding, which is going great and I am basically just studying and participating in things that I have interest in.

It's April 2013 now. I applied to Toronto for Engineering along with Western and Queens

I had sent a letter regarding the issues I had faced and what my plan was to recover from the illness that affected my marks. This letter was sent to my first time applying in 2012

However, but time is ticking and unless nothing new comes up at the end of April, I'm sure that my chances of acceptance are now slim.

So now I'm confused at what to do now. If I do not receive any acceptances

Hell, if it comes down to the worst, I'd like to know what others would advise me to do at this point forward (as a contingency plan). I may also speak to my councelor if I can contact her, but at the moment, looks like I need some comfort and advice from Reddit.

It's happened to me before, you got to know what you're doing and why – otherwise why is it worth it? How do you guys figure that key part out? I have discipline but don't know where it's worth spending it. I love too many things. I want to play violin professionally (I’m not a freaking prodigy but work my ass off). I want to be a filmmaker (but I've made only 3 short films and could be a lot better). I want to write short stories, a history book, scripts. I want to be a teacher someday in the far-off future.


HOW DO YOU CHOOSE? I’m sick and tired of spreading myself too thin. I've been told I show glimmers of talent wherever I go. My film professor says I have ""the eye."" My violin teacher says I pick up things far more quickly than her other students do, film, writing). I come alive in the editing room, glowing with excitement as I piece together stories; I dream about violin-playing and feel my day fulfilled after a hearty practice sesh; I love painting a canvas of words and ideas and other worlds.


The trouble is, I’m sure I’d feel more passionate about it too. I’ve considered my core values and tried to match them up with one of these paths, but it seems irrelevant. I just have to choose, but I also am worried about money and success. I do have to fend for myself now after college, and I don’t want to get stuck with something else just for the money. I want to choose one of these paths and make it my life. I think I’d die if I had to give up my violin – I’d be happy being a teacher although I’d want more. A part of me also withers thinking about not making films anymore – it’s been my dream since hs, but I’m not sure if for shallow reasons. Could anyone offer some advice?

Whoever was responsible for coining this phrase was certainly not talking about enacting change.  They may have been talking about a friendship, pitfalls, frustration, and a complete lack of self-esteem. Otherwise, there would be no need to change, now would there?  

We are now two, and I am working on my goals that were abandoned last year. Paramount is the goal to get into shape. As is par for the course, I have waited until nearly the last minute to work on losing weight, something I have always wanted to do, and now I am stuck in 2013 at only a few pounds shy of 250. At times, I feel as though I am actually stuck in time due to my girth. I know this is a ridiculous notion, but it’s a real one nonetheless.   

Let me just say that Zig Zigler is an exceptionally motivational man. I couldn’t make it halfway through a youtube video about his enacting change lectures without the urge to run away as quickly as possible. So naturally, my throat throbbing like a mad cock, and now I can’t seem to shake a cough. My legs are shaking, barely sturdy enough to hold my weight as I walk across my house, and upon closer inspection, my head seemed to have adopted the throbbing once seated in my throat. Let me reiterate this, there is nothing even remotely pretty about change.  

However, we truly are the most pathetic species currently living. Granted, I’m not making a case for humanity here, far from it, but at least there is some comfort (however bleak) in knowing that there is a reason we are all so fat and lazy. I’ve spent the past month or so on a number of sub-reddits looking for answers, motivation, and others that are struggling the same as I am. I have found plenty of the latter two, too

The idea of change is the most beautiful concept ever conceived by mankind. It means that, but the possibility will always be present, even if it is so far away that it seems invisible. That in no way means that the process itself is something worth admiring for its radiant glory. Its often sweaty, obscene, and downright hard to witness.   

So here I sit, I felt the burn of my sides reach deeper under the panging muscle and set ablaze my hatred for the idea of change. If not for it, I would still be comfortable, sipping on tea or coffee, eating myself into a larger pant size, without care or even notice.   

But alas, but that isn’t the point. I will be happy with the result. My happiness is not in the process, but in the result. That is where we all must look. That is where the beauty truly is.

Just do it.

Heard this before? I have, but I couldn’t sit down and do the work. It was very frustrating for me (as I’m sure many of you will commiserate – the hours sitting staring at a wall, fucking around, watching deadlines edge closer, handing in really crap rushed pieces of work…)


I talked to people a lot about this problem, 'You just do it!'  You've just got to do it. Just got to make yourself do it. Just, just, just... yeah, but HOW?


I never got a different answer. It started to piss me off. Feeling like the use of the word 'just' insinuated that this was somehow easy or intrinsic.  And I shouldn’t be having a problem doing these things


Like just 'doing it' had never occurred to me? Obviously there is another step in there that some people are missing. I have been hunting what that step is for ten years.  In between waking up, and the rest of my day.... something happens. Something that causes other people to just get on with it.  But it didn’t happen with me, and so I couldn't get out of bed. I would feel tired and sorry for myself and reset my alarm and skip class and sleep in and lose time. What was the difference? 


These days I think I’ve finally figured it out. ***For me, so I essentially sabotaged myself - not really trying, not trying hard enough, not giving things a go... what was the point if I couldn’t anyway? So the thing that happens between wanting to do something, and doing it, is the solid belief that you can actually do it.  But how do you get that?


Well I didn’t find this answer first and apply it with pleasing results.  It happened the other way around.  Over the last ten years my life has gone from really, university marks, job opportunities… and now I’m getting out of bed an hour early some mornings to exercise, and in my third year of studying medicine.  Which is incredible for me! 


However I find that as my self esteem improves


So looking back it makes sense for me, taking out the rubbish, studying a bit at home, and most importantly getting up in the morning to exercise.  I’m a lot more positive about the results these days as well – I don’t expect to be perfect straight away and I know that complete self-discipline is the long term goal that will take lots of practice. 


Anyway, how to develop self-confidence? Although I am doing that steadily, I have no idea how it’s occurring.  Might be worth thinking about a bit more.

Hello everyone.

I'm taking 15 months off because I just finished my exams and I don't feel now would be the best time to start a study and commit myself to another 4-5 years of something while I have seen so little of the world.

So there it is

I've already seen [this thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1e5ko0/productive_ways_to_fill_the_day/c9x3g6x). 

What I am looking into right now is language courses in foreign countries (I'm Dutch). To be able to pay for these 2-3 month periods I shall be working 3 times a week, but I will still be spending most of my time in Holland at home, so I'm looking for advice on that period.


These are some things that I thought would be good to try:

*Work out every day that I don't work (I already do this anyway)

*Learn to cook

*Read (philosofical) books

*Master Lucid Dreaming


**My main goal for these 15 months is to expand my horizon &amp; become a more complete/developed person in all ways so I can feel more comfortable choosing a study for next year.**

1364424989.0,1b539z,[POST 2]: My road to getting disciplined and to living a better life.,,11,2,1,"*When you start lifting weights, 20


Another 7 days have passed since I started this challenge to getting disciplined, in the past, have stayed up a single night to do work (unless it was finals week). The only time I ever stayed up was to browse reddit, youtube subscriptions and/or play video games. Now, I stayed up to do work, which paid off so greatly. Just few days back I received my grade and I ended up scoring a perfect score.


However, I was ready to rock and roll by the time weekend rolled around. Before bed on friday, I put together all my notebooks, notes, papers, pen and anything else I needed to be productive. But then, as I woke up late on saturday morning, it was already ~1:50pm. Then all weekend I avoided work. I didn't touch a single note on my study table. Instead


Then on Monday, it is better than before I started this challenge. The problem is that when we try to become disciplined or just motivated to do better. We get that rush at first and we do a lot of work and get a lot of stuff done. But then it all runs out and your back to the same person you were before. I think we push ourselves too much the first week and then just want to do nothing the next week. 


Again, we make a habit out of unproductive things. And in order to get disciplined we have to start small and every small step counts. Before this I would never make my bed when I woke up, now that’s the first thing I do even if I wake up late.

[Post from last week](http://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1apuld/post_1_my_road_to_getting_disciplined_and_to/)

**TIP 2: Small steps make big changes!**

Before this challenge when I was trying so hard to get disciplined. I pushed myself way too hard for a day or two and then gave up because I would get exhausted and didn't want to put up with it. I even made task lists before but they would just roll around in my bag and be forever forgotten in time. Last week, i'm going to do the introduction then 15 minute break. Then do ..."" The funny thing is that when i finished the introduction, I took like a 5 minute break and went back to work. It was actually an interesting topic that i kept going on to the next part. You should also try doing this. It works with any task or goal. Start with a small step.


*Don't look at the task as a whole


* Start by breaking down the work you want to do. If you can do the task next week but want to get a head start then start by doing half of the task today.
* Your gonna get demotivated and get lazy but when you feel like you are doing something your not suppose to
* Keep pushing even if you think your not making progress. Every little bit counts towards the big reward.
* Take breaks frequently and keep working towards your goals.
* Lastly


**Failure is inevitable


Well this has been ~14 days for me. I am motivated to keep going and keep learning from fellow redditors and other bloggers on the internet. Still got tons to learn. Now my goal is to come up with a basic everyday routine and weekly routine. I want to start working out, get disciplined mentally and physically.

I will start off by describing how my life is now and will then outline what I am going to do.


I am a 22 year old computer science student


Sleeping in is another bad habit I have


Yet another bad habit I have is smoking


Finally I am a bit chubby


Now that I have described my present situation this is how I am going to get out of it and change my life:


I am going to change 6 habits over the next 4 months And I will track my progress by posting weekly updates on the respective subreddits most relevant to the current habit I am changing.  Below is the list of habits I will change and the subreddit I will use to provide updates on.


1. Getting up at 7 am every morning           - [/r/GetOutOfBed](http://tk.reddit.com/r/GetOutOfBed/)
2. Stop procrastinating                            - [/r/Productivity](http://tk.reddit.com/r/productivity/)
3. Stopping smoking                                - [/r/StopSmoking](http://tk.reddit.com/r/StopSmoking)
4. Implementing GTD into my Life               -[/r/Productivity](http://tk.reddit.com/r/productivity/)
5. Exercising everyday                             -[/r/Fitness](http://tk.reddit.com/r/Fitness)
6. Eating a more balanced and healthy diet  -[/r/Fitness](http://tk.reddit.com/r/Fitness)


I will spend 30 days conditioning each habit except the Procrastination habit which will take about 6 weeks. The reason I am using different subreddits to update my progress on each habit is because the readers there will most likely be going through something similar and will be able to hopefully offer better advice and feedback. The numbers in the list above are the order in which I will start each habit change. To begin I am going to tackle the sleeping and procrastination habits at the same time and that starts today!.


Sorry for the really long post


**tldr;** I will be changing 6 habits over the next 4 months and will be providing weekly updates on my progress using the subreddits listed above.

**Edit**
These posts outline exactly what I am going to do for my first two habit changes:

The best thing you can do for yourself is simply being active. Physically active. Physical activity releases endorphins into your brain meats. Endorphins make you happy and

I have recently started a process that I’m calling “mathing.” If you’ve ever seen Adventure Time then you know that they use math as a synonym for awesome or cool. The point is to make yourself more awesome today than you were yesterday. Step one, a few little leather bound notebooks. One of these is your “physical activity” journal. In this journal you will write down every physical activity that you do. Jogging, push ups, pull ups, sit ups, racquetball, practicing a martial art, because that’s where I waste the most time. Now, new happiness.  

Another important part of this is to set goals! Start your first week with doing a few sets here and there, jerking off, or whatever it is that you do with your life. Record the number in each set and the number of sets, as well as the specific type of exercise. (e.g. push ups: standard push ups 1 of 25, 1 of 20, wide push ups 1 of 25, close push ups 1 of 25) Note: you are going to want to make some short hand notation.  Once you’ve done a week go through and total up your exercises. I count different types of an exercise all as the same exercise, do you think you could have done more? Add 50 – 200 to next week’s goal. Do you think you couldn’t have realistically done more but after this week you probably can? Add 25 – 100 to next week’s goal. Make your goals realistic! I can’t stress this part enough. That’s the entire point of the first week without a goal

Optional: I started with just a push ups goal, wide grip, and standard, or hybrid, grip so as to have an even spread of gains. 

Your other notebook is your food journal. Write down EVERYTHING that you eat and drink (aside from water) in the best measurements you can. You’ll notice that once you’ve written in a meal and you are thinking about going back for seconds, not only do you have to put that you ate more food, you have to cross out the healthy portion to replace it with an unhealthy portion, this is where the punishment comes in. This one is best kept as the little leather bound notebook as they are easier to carry around. Keep it with you at all times! Try to eat a bit healthier every day. I know I sure as hell don’t want to see “Taco Bell” written in my food journal.

Now you are healthier and happier and less able to give fucks. Congratulations!

Optional: I have several other goals that I’m setting, beat my roommate at racquetball, relearn C, and teach myself basic Topology. I will keep as much of this stuff recorded as I can. I may also start recording my study time. I find it a nice way to keep myself accountable for my time and to avoid spending too much time on the internets.",,False,,False,t3_zofn8

The problem is that I practically slog through my learning. I accomplish it

**A detail of my day**

-Wake up at 5:30 A.M, and relax for 20 minutes prior to leaving the house at 6:40 to head out for school.

**School breakdown:**

Pre-Calculus Honors

Physics for 80 minutes due to lab

Orchestra

Health(joke class)

AP US History

AP Language

AP Chemistry for 80 minutes due to lab

No free time in school except twice a week.

**At home:**

-Eat good pre-dinner at 2:15PM (I eat lunch in a class)

-Relax 2-3 hours or do homework right away cutting down on relaxation time.

-Learn until 8PM.
     -This consists of various online college courses, business, economics, math, etc..., programming, learn German and anything else I can fit in.

-Work out (90+ push-ups at once

-Read fiction novel of choice for 1-2 hours.

-Meditate prior to sleeping

-Overall sleep time = 6-8 hours



**To note:** 

I don't have procrastination issues (homework

I've slowly recovered from a year-long depression (almost ended in suicide if that's of relevance) a few months back and I currently emotionally feel the best I've been in a very long time

No weight issues

****
I just lack some energy and focus as result of said lack and wondered if anyone had any tips to overcome this hurdle.

A possible hypothesis of mine is that I completely lose momentum in some way.

Any advice would be welcome and I thank each and every one of you in advance.

I just started eating kind of whatever the night I came back when I was fixing dinner, and afterwards, I felt guilty, so guilty.

My parents are loving and caring people

Then we have my dad who is a health nut

I felt kinda ""blah"" the next day so I said ""whatever"" and just ate whatever was easiest to make.  Come monday I'm back on the grind.  Back at school and feeling better with the gym time I'm putting in and the food that I'm eating.

**Here is my problem-  I'm a huge Ravens fan and I'm going home to watch the SB with my family.  I'm pretty sure we won't be doing anything fancy, because I know that the support from this sub is pretty high up there.  I'd say it's pretty close to /r/loseit to be honest.**

1351042728.0,11zct2,Weekly Ask &amp; Share Thread,TheCourageWolf,10,1,4,"My plan is to make this ""Ask &amp; Share"" a weekly thread where we can:

1. Share how we are getting disciplined.

2. Ask for advice on getting disciplined.

**Outline**

- Goal.  What is the end product of the discipline you are aiming to achieve?

- Plan.  To know if you are being disciplined you need a daily plan

- Execution.  What things can you do to help you carry out your plan daily? 

---------

**RPM Method**

Need to add how you will measure your results and also measure how well you are carrying out your plan.

For example if you a learning a skill

For weight loss you can measure your weight (measuring the result) but you can also measure your exercise and diet (energy expenditure and energy intake).


**Result**

- What result do you want?  Be as specific as possible.

**Plan**

- What is your daily/weekly plan for getting this result?

Losing weight: do exercise X 30 minutes every day

Study: 1 hour self study on weekdays

- Do you have a plan that someone else has followed and obtained the result you want?

Losing weight: couch to 5k

Study: one mentioned above or something in /r/getstudying

- Make it a positive

I would suggest framing your second result in positive terms. Instead of writing ""stop hitting the snooze button"" write ""I will get out of bed as soon as my alarm goes off""

**Motivators**

- Extrinsic motivators: Why do you want this result?

Losing weight: increased confidence, positive attention, increased stamina.

Study: increased knowledge

- Intrinsic motivators: What do you enjoy about the task itself?

For losing weight

For study, enjoying thinking through problems and content you are study.  The process of writing out notes by hand, or maybe even enjoying group study with classmates.

**Measurement**

- How will you measure your result?

For losing weight this would be measuring your weight and tracking it.
For study this would be your exam mark.

- How will you measure your performance?

For losing weight this would be measuring your caloric intake and expenditure through exercise.

For study this would be the number of hours you have studied this week.

Currently, I work part-time for my father, and I do other miscellaneous jobs throughout the week. This is a big burden for anybody and it leaves little time for social life, but I am able to keep my grades high and I have become extraordinarily productive. Here are some tips that I use throughout my day/ week

* Sunday Funday: Sundays are the most important day of the week hands down. This is where you get all of your homework laid out for the week, especially with school, to spend one Sunday setting up every week's worth of homework for all of my classes so I don't have to scramble. Plus, this allows Sunday to give me a head start on my school work to ease my workload during the week...This pays off. Sundays are also when I do my cooking for the week, making PB &amp; J's and freezing them, etc.. Anything to make my week easier I do it.

* Lists, but I also do a daily list the night before each upcoming day. This includes homework, meetings, and anything else. I use an outline format and my co-workers often notice that I am constantly making outlines which helps me to avoid missing any small details. Now, I have read many articles about being productive and how to keep yourself from being overwhelmed, lists are key to this and there should be a way you can use them to keep yourself from staring at it like ""holy fuck"". Make 1 list in its entirety of everything you have to do. Then, you can use small pieces of paper and put each individual item on the piece of paper and put them in the order they must get done. This gives you a couple advantages, 2) you are able to add notes to each item which helps you remember past thoughts and create more ideas for it

* Motivation: Probably the hardest part for me as well as many others. It's just kind of self-help for the first 3 weeks, and start being productive. Straight up. Yeah, all of my friends are partying or having so much fun, but I am doing something better, I am doing something that is going to help me for the rest of my life and can only help me and never hurt me. Just look it at like that. There is plenty of time for fun, but that comes later. I'm learning that as I go along and have been learning that since I was younger when my dad wouldn't let me take off of work on my birthday, now I expect to work everyday and holidays because it has become engraved.

* Studying French
 * Operate a side business

No mystery there. The problem is getting form where you are to where you want to be

I don’t know what the hell I’m doing. I mean that in a lot of ways. I don’t know what I want to do (I’m a university student and I haven’t declared my major). I don’t know how to best do the things I enjoy doing (writing fiction). And – most importantly – I don’t know what I do with my day.

I'm going to monitor time spent on the internet, amount of sleep, (possibly) amount of exercise, and (possibly) diet. I’ll use this information to figure out what I’m currently doing, what I’m capable of, and then, to test different strategies for making myself more productive.

My goal (far-fetched as it may right now seem) is to be eventually capable of putting in eight hours of focused work a day. This isn’t eight hours of manual labor (I currently work part-time washing tables); this is eight hours of focused, or programming). I’d like to be capable of working hard for sixteen hours, if need be.

I’m going to use RescueTime to monitor my computer usage. I’m going to track TV and work time by hand, I may then record additional data, but I’ll try not to overwhelm myself and burn out. Again, the goal is to gain insight into what I’m doing with my day, and then to move on from there. And then I'm going to post that information.

I’m all too aware that the act of monitoring might influence my behavior or make me feel shit enough about myself to inspire preference for ignorance over information. (I’ve quit calorie counting before because I felt bad plugging in certain foods. Multiple times.) To combat this

I don't get a lot done; I already know that. Trying to change that is going to require knowing what I want

I figure I would share my process as how I do it. There really isn't any special trick other than just ""doing it"". But I can make other peoples' lives a bit easier .....

**History:**

My problem when it comes to losing weight is lack of proper discipline. I tend to overeat healthy foods. It's a bitch when you eat healthy but still can't lose weight. Given that my days are very hectic and busy

The only way I managed to lose weight previously was to count calories. But that's a bitch right? It sure was. I struggled for few years but thanks to Reddit

It clicked. It was absolutely true. I realized that all my past accomplishments were due to ""buckling down and getting shit done"". I was determined to figure out a practical system on how to lose weight by counting calories while minimizing all inconveniences.

Here is my system. I'm sure it's nothing really new...

**Planning**

I use MyFitnessPal.com to determine caloric requirements based on my weight

I split my my day into 3 meals

I make ""meal templates"" using Google Docs. The idea behind a ""meal template"" is for me to simply plug in ""1900 calories"" into the spreadsheet and the formulas will spit out the weight/quantity of each ingredient required to complete that meal. Each meal is also properly balanced on the macro-nutrition level (50% fat

Once I plug the 1900 calories/day into my selected ""meal/snack templates"", 3 meals * 4 days = 12 meals. 2 snacks * 4 days = 8 snacks. 

What you now have is a shopping list of ingredients to buy. The beauty of this is you know exactly how much to buy of everything. No more wasted food! I found thought that you typically need to buy a bit extra.

**Process**

Preparation is key! I prepare all ingredients - cutting vegetables

I split my kitchen counter into 3 sections:
* Left = Containers/tupper-ware
* Center = Digital weight scale
* Right = Ingredients

I have about 20 equal size containers for food. They are all placed usually in a 4x3 grid to the left of an electric scale. I simply pick one ingredient and I equally distribute it into all containers. I do this by placing the container on the scale

I try to run an ""efficient kitchen"". I always look for minor adjustments to speed things up. Here an example:

*Empty the garbage bag/container prior to starting. It's annoying to have an over flooding garbage in the middle of cooking. Keep the trash can out and next to you (not underneath the sink as usual). It's very easy to toss non-edible items (e.g. stems) straight into the garbage while cutting/preparing when it's next to you. You're also cleaning up at the same time.*

Tools are your friend! At first you will not have many. That's OK. Identify what repetitive process you may want to improve. If your tool is shitty

* Peeling avocado: http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kuhn-rikon-all-in-one-avocado-tool/?pkey=e%7Cavacado%7C8%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C5&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-Feature_Recipe_Rule-_-
* Non-stick pans
* Proper cutting knives
* Mandolines - amazing for cutting vegetables very quickly. http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/de-buyer-deluxe-dicing-mandoline/?cm_src=AutoCatRel
* Kitchen Mixer - amazing for mashing up avocados. http://www.williams-sonoma.com/products/kitchenaid-artisan-stand-mixer/?pkey=e%7Cmixer%7C36%7Cbest%7C0%7C1%7C24%7C%7C8&amp;cm_src=PRODUCTSEARCH||NoFacet-_-NoFacet-_-NoMerchRules-_-
* Electric weight scale - make sure to keep spare batteries. Last thing you want to happen is for the scale to die while in the middle of packaging food.

**Summary**

Here is a time break down as of today:

* Planning: 10 min approx.
* Purchasing ingredients: 1 hour
* Cooking: 2.5 hours approx
* Cleaning: 30 min

So in about 5 hours I have everything done and clean. I know this seems a lot and probably OCD-like. It's not. What I've done is basically:

* Prepared all my meals for 3-4 days
* Pre-calculated calorie requirements for weight lost
* Bought near exact amount of ingredients
* Freed up plenty of time for next 3-4 days
* Properly balanced meals
* You don't have to waste time counting calories every day.

I'm not the biggest fan of cooking for solo purposes. So I constantly look for areas to improve.

* Playlists are your friend. The time investment to set up a few good playlists can pay dividends. This avoids sitting there fiddling with your iPod looking for the right song. Set up playlists and title them by mood or activity instead of genre; 'work', etc.

* Non lyrical music is awesome. There have been studies that show it's basically impossible to NOT follow the lyrics of music or spoken words. Our brains are hardwired to key into language. But you don't have to punish yourself to listen to instrumental music; whatever genres you like now probably has offered some great instrumental only music

* Look for medium intensity music as well as high energy workout music. I enjoy some nice driving electric blues

* If I'm in a lazy or lethargic mood just putting on some pump up high energy music feels forced, picks me up, and elevates me to motivated or positive. My favorite example is the Overture of 1812. Over the ~15 minute piece it starts slow and gradually crescendos into that awesome finale (seen V for Vendetta?) that never fails to encourage me. A lot of classical music does this for me because I feel like I follow it on a much more emotional level and that rising format is common for symphonies.

* Association is a powerful mental tool. If you listen to the same song every day right before your brush your teeth,,False,,t5_2uzju,False,,True

Don't know what to do, being a tool for easier procrastinating. Even tho I sounds ironic: I was and am always on the look for solutions. But these solutions are running thin. Impending doom. Tick tock. There are a lot of more factors which I probably forgot to mention, but I am ~~a bit~~ emotional right now. 
This is how I reflect back on the issues I am facing

When I was ~3 and my brother ~6 my mother committed suicide by taking an OD of prescription drugs. She was manic depressive for the largest part of her life. As I was 3, but you never know If that's an projected image of a retold memory.
My dad worked at Sony at that time
He worked as a taxi driver and a bar keeper later on. He developed a increasingly stronger alcohol addiction. Why? He developed this for the same reason I used to like weed for all these years. It stops the feels.

Fast forward ''the same old shit'' to about 2004-2005. 
Woke up by a loud screaming ''COME DOWN NOW''. Me and my brother rush out of our rooms to open the door to the stair that leads downstairs. The moment I open it a wall of smoke hits my face. Adrenaline and *survival instinct* kick in. I don't know exactly what happened after that. But I do know at a certain time I walk in the wrong room (the room the fire started) because well

I run around in my underwear ringing people's doorbell saying ''my house is on fire
Got into hospital, we were really lucky. We could have all died if it took half a minute more. 


There is much more to this. For instance

I personally became very unmotivated at school

Everyone was obviously traumatized. My dad started to drink more. I started having one bad repeating dream about an previous event. These dreams had an ''alternative ending'' ~~ifyouknowwhatimean~~.
Now, in a situation were I see no solution. 

My dad has COPD
All in all

We tried alcohol clinics, but it's like he's implying I should kill him. **Obviously I would never do this** **IWOULDREALLYNOT**
Even tho I had similar conversations during the years

Before I move up to the last bit I want to make sure you know this. 
I am not looking for money, moving on. 
I now have about 600 EU for 22 days. My dad has no money and is buried in debt (inb4 they come to take stuff). He's gonna need money for his addictions
And money is not even the main problem here. Its my dad his mental state. I don't know what to do. I have people IRL where I talk about these things. Everyone offers to help in some way. ''Well if there is anything i can do...'' But the problem is

Maybe here, anything.

In tenth grade, and trust me, when I got those report cards, I was one of the happiest kids ever. It wasn't all pretty however. That year, I was pretty bad socially both when I played video games and when I was a grade maniac. Furthermore, whenever, I had something ""terrible"" happen to me during the grade maniac time, I had an anxiety attack. Still

My attitude with school in general was kind of interesting as well. I would try to make everything absolutely perfect

During the summer after tenth grade, I just felt really depressed and thought I was a loser. I also had terrible acne and that made me depressed as well. Furthermore, I had an insomnia problem which affected me greatly in the next school year. 

Contrary to the summer, would be a giant pitfall. I missed school for three in one week at the end of the first month and went to a psychiatrist who gave me sleep meds. I didn't take them since I was a dumbass. After missing those three days, my life went downhill. I regained my depression, didn't hang out with friends, and my grades started tanking. I had several delusions most likely due to a lack of sleep. For instance, I thought me and one of my teachers secretly had a ""thing."" A couple months later after a terrible incident where my delusions were at their peak, I started taking the meds like I was supposed to. I finished that semester with three B's and three A's so it wasn't terrible

This semester was completely about me trying to regain my edge in grades. I looked up a whole bunch of articles about self-discipline, I still wanted to work on my discipline where I could make great grades again. The truth was, my ""relaxed"" period wasn't very relaxed since I was constantly anxious about my future. 

Lately I have realized that the difference was in my mindset. When I was successful, not the ""delusional"" one) which was good. However, I procrastinated a shit ton. That's where I stand now-- a procrastinator who wants good grades but a healthy life as well. Maybe it's not possible. Maybe there's not enough time in the day. One thing I do know is that I waste a lot of time on the computer, so hopefully there's a chance.

So I've always been bad at sticking to to-do lists, sticky notes, you name it. But I found a new way.

Maybe it won't work for everybody but instead of having throwaway bits of paper that I use for to-do lists (which I can easily throw away if I fail to do everything and forget about it), ""Oh yeah, I did that, hurray!"" or making you feel bad for not doing it and the reminder to do it is inescapable because it's in this little book that you can carry around with you everywhere. 

And if you're like me and you don't want to fail and not be able to cross something out

I'd like advice on how to achieve 68% in my exams given my difficulties that I would also like to share. I do quite a stringent course which I have found overwhelming at multiple times both in workload and in the work content. Being overwhelmed has led me to procrastination which is my 2nd problem.

I have three months to get myself to a point where I can get 68% in these exams. It is possible

Hard work is something I'm happy to do

Cheers guys
