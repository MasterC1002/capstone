The same way Wal-Mart serves the public. Private business owners have their customers at heart. The government just cares about getting tax money. They're greedy. They don't offer what people want, or not and go their separate ways.

Big government of officials at the whims of the people are somehow *more greedy* than **Wal-Mart**

Why: American gets over 80% of its oil from within the country from American Oil Companies. The Oil Companies in America have this country by the nuts, but continue to raise the price, which hurts the Proletariat, or the middle class. In many ways, these oil companies have monopolized themselves, and have gotten their way into our government through the Republicans. There must be something the government can do against this. Nationalization? It's an amazing concept really, and I'll take you step by step.
How: You take the top three Oil Companies, if the powers be, this would get rid of a middle man, so to speak. Make gasoline free at the pump, (or at a lowered price such as less than a dollar a gallon.)
Benefits: Not only does this lessen the strain on Americans who are in need of transportation

I don't want you to just believe me. I have given you links so you can scrutinize my argument fully. Check up on me. Am I making this stuff up or exaggerating? Every effort has been made to use unimpeachable sources of primary data, which is a Chilean polling organization whose work features regularly in the Economist, Wall Street Journal and New York Times. Let's get mythbusting!

**The Accusation** Chavez led a coup. It is often remarked that Chavez led a coup in 1992. Two example is [this](http://www.nytimes.com/2002/04/13/opinion/hugo-chavez-departs.html) New York Times article and [this](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/key-events-in-hugo-chavezs-rise-to-power-and-presidency-in-venezuela/2013/03/05/8a4dddcc-85e1-11e2-a80b-3edc779b676f_story.html) Washington Post article. Conveniently, the majority of Venezuelans were living in shocking slums. By the 1990s, quality of life indicators for ordinary Caracas residents were  below Port-Au-Prince, Haiti. Between 1970 and 1997, workers' incomes declined by [50%, while poverty doubled between 1984 and 1991](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040274?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101776675521)

President Carlos Andres Perez, to the point where Caracas residents were spending, on average, 25% of their entire wages on bus fares.  (Jones, B. [“Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362578797&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=hugo+bart+jones) p. 116) Food riots broke out and Perez sent the army in. 3 days of terror ensued. The LA Times, Bart Jones speaks of Red Cross workers being gunned down in the street, “mass graves” being filled with “mutilated corpses”, B. [Hugo!](http://www.amazon.com/HUGO-THE-CHAVEZ-STORY/dp/1847920055/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1362578797&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=hugo+bart+jones) pp.121-124) Much of the army leadership was deeply shocked at this. They began to gather around a young Colonel called Hugo Chavez and conspired to rebel against the President. The rebellion of 1992 failed, Rafael Caldera was essentially forced to release Chavez just 2 years later. After getting out he immediately began to organize for a Presidential election.

**Myth: Partially confirmed**

Myth 2- The Venezuelan economy is a shambles. In [this](http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-oil-giants-squeeze-chavez) Guardian article, show a different story. Venezuela's GDP has [more than tripled under Chavez,](http://i.imgur.com/CyeLEvC.jpg) while net national income [has also nearly tripled.](http://i.imgur.com/gKd5YBs.jpg) Meanwhile, both the [United Nations Development Project](http://i.imgur.com/cdaFIOv.jpg) and the [World Bank](http://i.imgur.com/eKaova1.jpg) agree that unemployment has dropped from over 11% to under 8%. When asked themselves, Venezuelans have the [highest confidence in their economy of any Latin American country.](http://i.imgur.com/QtZ7L3x.jpg) Venezuela's external debt has [dropped precipitously.](http://i.imgur.com/rJSNmaS.jpg) Meanwhile, Venezuela's stock market is the [best-performing](http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2012/dec/31/venezuela-best-stock-market-2012) in the [world.](http://www.tradingeconomics.com/venezuela/stock-market) You may have heard stupid Chavez is causing massive inflation, [but the facts are the opposite](http://i.imgur.com/uSq7BFY.jpg). One year before Chavez took office

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Chavez is a dictator**
This one is so ubiquitous I won't give examples. 

Voter turnout in Venezuela in the October 2012 election was above [80%](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election, voter turnout in Venezuelan elections has increased by 135% (1998 turnout: [6.3mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_1998), 2012 turnout:[14.8 mil](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venezuelan_presidential_election,_2012). That means almost two and a half times as many people vote nowadays than in the 1990s. The number of registered voter has risen by over 70% under Chavez.

Jimmy carter and the Nobel Peace Prize-Winning Carter Center recently stated [“the election process in Venezuela is the best in the world.”](http://therealnews.com/t2/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=31&amp;Itemid=74&amp;jumival=8935#.USvSHnMnty4) The European Union Election Observation Mission agreed, [2/3 believed they were.](http://i.imgur.com/BdT8eFj.jpg) Venezuelans rate their democracy the [second best in Latin America](http://i.imgur.com/MWs264L.gif). Venezuela has by far the most politcal parties in Latin America, and confidence in them is the [highest in the region.](http://i.imgur.com/c7B0Me0.jpg) In 2002, [80%](http://i.imgur.com/6uRqNRB.jpg) of Venezuelans believe their vote influences policy. Venezuelans were asked to rate their democracy from [1-10](http://i.imgur.com/an0pd2n.jpg) How does Chavez do it, it must be because...

**Myth: Chavez Controls the Media** There appears to be an authoritarian dictator crushing freedom of the press in Venezuela. We read about it all the time. How many free outlets are left?

As Mark Weisbrot has shown in an extensive study, and by virulent, Le Monde Diplo calls it [“hate media”](http://mondediplo.com/2002/08/10venezuela) while Richard Gott in the Guardian says the largest station, RCTV is a [“white supremacist channel”](http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jun/07/comment.venezuela) and JMH Salas reports that they regularly assault him with words like [“sambo, thick-lipped monkey” “ape”](http://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/30040277?uid=3738032&amp;uid=2129&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=70&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21101777011571) (Chavez is the first-non white President) In contrast to what we read, Venezuelans believe there's [about as much freedom of speech as there is in Spain](http://i.imgur.com/hD8PQxY.jpg) **Myth: Busted**

**Myth: There are food shortages in Venezuela**

Actually, eggs and pork](http://imgur.com/agUo7ym). Child malnutrition has dropped by [2/3 in 10 years](http://i.imgur.com/OeoP3DQ.jpg), too. So, are there food shortages? Look at this [anti-Chavez blogger's post](http://daniel-venezuela.blogspot.co.uk/2007/05/food-shortages-in-venezuela.html) He shows that food shortages mean the most popular mayonnaise is gone, but there are clearly 4 or 5 other brands still available. Again, white sugar is gone but there is plenty of brown left. Only one brand of powdered milk is left. The reason for this is Chavez instituted price-controls and gave people jobs, increasing their purchasing power. This meant for the first time in their lives, you can find out a lot about how the media see ordinary people. In the 1990s when children were dying from malnutrition

**Myth:** Venezuela is the most dangerous place in the world

There can be no doubt that there are many murders in Venezuela, “yes” dropped from [49% in 2000](http://i.imgur.com/SRufLZk.jpg) to [28% 2010](http://i.imgur.com/3u0luhO.jpg). Your chances of being a victim of crime have dropped by half while your fear of crime has spiked 6500%. 

**Myth: Partially Confirmed**

**Myth Hugo Chavez is anti-semitic**

The entire case for this comes from a quote where Chavez spoke ill of “those who crucified Jesus”. When read in context, those who betrayed Che Guevara, etc. [Here's a pic](http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5645) of Chavez meeting the leading Rabbi in venezuela. I might add that this is common tactic of the US elite. A New York Times search for [“Nicaragua anti-semitism”](http://query.nytimes.com/search/sitesearch/#/anti-semitism+nicaragua/) shows no hits for 130 years, a slew of stories between 1983-1986, when the left-wing Sandinistas were in charge, then nothing for 25 years.

**Myth: Busted**

**Myth: Hugo Chavez loves dictators like Saddam and Ahmadinejad .**

Most of the reports of this come from the time when Chavez went on a whistle-stop tour of the oil-producing countries. The day after he met Ahmadinejad, and his visits were laying the groundwork for an agreed reduction in oil drilling, in order to stabilize prices. 

**Myth: Busted**
**Myth: Chavez is an Isolated

Chavez was the first President of the [Pink Tide](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pink_tide), saying [""A victory for Chávez is not just a victory for the people of Venezuela but also a victory for all the people of Latin America … this victory will strike another blow against imperialism.""](www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2012/oct/03/why-us-dcemonises-venezuelas-democracy). President Correa of Ecuador has called Chavez “a guiding light”( Jones, B. “Hugo” p.420) [Here's a pic](http://paginadoenock.com.br/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/Kirchner-Evo-Lula-Chavez.jpg) of the Presidents of Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina with Chavez, and [here's](http://i.imgur.com/iaubmdb.jpg) what the Argentine public think of him. When asked which country they admired the most, Latin Americans chose [Venezuela by a considerable margin.](http://i.imgur.com/nOaLC5T.png)

**Myth: Busted**

**Bonus Myth: The People are worse off under Chavez**

Chavez instituted a national healthcare system which had performed 225 million consultations by 2007 alone. (Cannon, from 1628 to 19571 by 2007. 50,000 Venezuelans were given free operations to restore their sight, between 1 and 1.5 million were taught to read for the first time (Jones p. 8) Health expenditure per person [has tripled](http://i.imgur.com/PriJgse.jpg) According to the Gini coefficient, venezuela went from the most unequal country in Latin America to the most equal. An AC Nielsen/Datos report showed that, from 2004-2006, [97.6% of the population grew in income.](http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/2794)

Venezuela is one of the most vibrant democracies on Earth

For me


Venezuela is certainly not an ideal society by any means, as people like me are forced to spend their time correcting and replying to nonsense accusations.

Honestly

edit:
To the people comparing the military with the revolutionary militia

while I do admit that my original post was a tad too emotional/frustrated

 the problem with the military is basically like this

1. The top brass says jump

2. This unquestioning loyalty is not even seen as a ""necessary evil""

3. The military is waging a war between the working class, but the same happens on the street he gets 20 years in prison. In both cases a member of the proletariat killed another, the only difference is in the first one he killed someone in the interests of the bourgeoisie.

4. It doesn't have to be this way, for as a class we all share the same interests

5. To top it all not only does the military perpertrate the tyranny of the bourgeoisie over the proletariat

&gt; Yes

&gt;If I should steal something from you, if possible, because the law forbids stealing. It says that no one has a right to take anything from you without your consent.

&gt;But your employer takes from you what you produce. The whole wealth produced by labor is taken by the capitalists and kept by them as their property.

&gt;The law says that your employer does not steal anything from you, the law says that he does not steal anything from you.

&gt;But did you really consent?

&gt;When the highwayman holds his gun to your head, because you are compelled by his gun.

&gt;Are you not compelled to work for an employer? Your need compels you, under the capitalist industrial system you must work for an employer. The factories, machinery, and tools belong to the employing class, so you must hire yourself out to that class in order to work and live. Whatever you work at, whoever your employer may be, it always comes to the same: you must work for him. You can’t help yourself You are compelled.

&gt;In this way the whole working class is compelled to work for the capitalist class. In this manner the workers are compelled to give up all the wealth they produce. The employers keep that wealth as their profit, so he can go on producing more wealth for his employer. Is that not cheating, robbery?

&gt;The law says it is a ‘free agreement’. Just as well might the highwayman say that you ‘agreed’ to give up your valuables. The only difference is that the highwayman’s way is called stealing and robbery, profit making, and is protected by law.

&gt;But whether it is done in the highwayman’s way or in the capitalist way

&gt;The whole capitalist system rests on such robbery.

To socialists: if you think feminism is a central part of socialism, it's /r/socialism.

Why should we be any different? Is that really in the interest of socialism?

1322768778.0,mwhmc,My life as a manager for one of the world's biggest corporations: FedEx Ground.,ryan_meets_wall,133,14,88,"So it is 2 30 PM here on the East coast, like sending food aid around the globe in times of crisis. 

When I first started my job over 2 years ago, 6 during Christmas season. I hated it for a while, but I got quite good at it and began to enjoy my job. I was being paid ten dollars an hour plus a 1 dollar bonus for showing up every day. That is how hard this job is. People come in and leave after a few hours because they realize they aren't being paid nearly enough to do this job. But I digress. I enjoyed my job, and I was good at it. I eventually switched shifts, and spent time loading ""pups"" small trailers that are loaded front to back. I got so good at my job, in fact, I applied for a promotion and became a manager. 

Before I became a manager

FedEx Ground has certain minimum standards that are required to be met, people who load trucks are expected to load 400 packages an hour. The size, weight and all of that do not matter. 400 an hour, minimum, for just ten dollars an hour. Now, factor in that you cannot damage the packages, you must pack the entire truck and make it neat, well you have a recipe for slavery more or less. 

That used to be me. Now, its acknowledged implicitly, starve). They know I know how impossible this job is. because I have been there. It does not matter. All the meanwhile, I am expected to not help as much as possible, to handle as few packages as possible. Because after all, I just ""manage"". So, the end result is that people who are working another job or going to school, end up working their asses off for nothing. The only thing they get is a handful of paid vacation days and health benefits that are taken out of their paychecks

All the meanwhile people who do not even TOUCH a package are making huge amounts of money off these people. The worst part is FedEx is anti-union. 

I hate that I have this job now. I had no idea it would be like this. My boss always tells me the package handler's world is tiny, etc. I hate it. And I have a son on the way, and every day I know one day he will have to work at a job that makes him feel like he is worthless. And I hate it. 

I am an anarcho-socialist. and every day I have to against what I know to be true as a socialist. I am coming to hate myself for it, but it has been building. If FedEx is a measure of how great capitalism is, and capitalism a gauge on human advancement, then we have gotten nowhere in the last 300 years. I am just exhausted with this illusion, and needed to share it. ",,False,t5_2qjii,True

Since then Nepal is growing leaps and bounds with the rights of economic health of its people. Yes it is not a paradise and is still pretty unstable

* Nepal is a secular democracy
* Full citizenship for indivudals who consider themselves 3rd gender (not perfect
* Abolished Haliya
* Life expectancy at 5 is higher that the rest of south Asia
* Inflation is reduced to 7%
* real GDP growth of 3.8% 
* Literacy has increased from 54% to 65.9% since 2011
* The country's GINI coefficient has fallen from 41 to 35 between 03 and 2011
* Nepal gets only 0.1% of its GDP from foreign investment- average of similar counties is 1.9%
* Decline in stunted/wasted/underwieght children under 5 since 2007
* Primary enrollment has jumped from 74% in 95 to 90% in 09.
* The Community Forestry Program


Nepal is a resource poor country with no ocean ports and is hemmed in by authoritarian  China to the east and a right-wing India to the east. It has a long way to go- in health, anyone with personal experience?

When I decided I was a socialist, and seems like a very logical one in my mind. It seems that my problem now is understanding how so many people come to the exact opposite conclusion. I don't understand how they can view the way in which this country runs, and then say that system is not flawed. Something in my mind does not compute this reasoning. Is it because they have never actually taken the time to think about it(and let someone else do the thinking for them), or do they refuse to acknowledge what is actually happening in their surroundings?

---

Dear comrade

Larisa Boyar, as protest demonstrations were due to begin, these 'Dissenters' were grabbed by police directly from their homes. By 7.30 in the evening they had been sentenced to 15 days' immediate detention.

**We urgently need protest emails and letters to be sent to the embassy in Britain and to Kazakhstan. Details of where to send them are at the end of this email. Also attached is a Campaign Kazakhstan petition which could be used on May Day protests. Finally we will be organising a lobby of the Kazakhstan embassy in London on Wednesday 2 May at 9 am. Please attend if you can.**

At the 'trial'

This court decision is politically motivated and is yet again evidence of the authorities' persecution of oppositionists for their beliefs.

At the demonstration there had been about 40 people who came from Shymkent. They had  been there to highlight the problems of people being harassed by banks over the loans they had taken for homes. Guests of the 'Dissenters' also included workers from the corporation

Over the past week

The most active members of Socialist Movement have had criminal proceedings initiated against them with fines imposed of up to 300, ""Zhanartu"" - Ainur Kurmanov and Esenbek Ukteshbaev – have been pursued by the authorities of Kazakhstan and have had to go abroad.

Thanks to the international solidarity of socialists

**Release Larissa Boyar and the activists of the SMK!**

**Drop all charges and stop harassment of the 'Dissenters'**


Yours in solidarity

Hannah Sell

Socialist Party (CWI England &amp; Wales)

First of all

This past year Socialism has really grown into me and I'm really sure that it is the best ideology there is.

But I don't know much about ""real socialism""

You may have another view on socialism and that's why I ask you guys to educate me about what socialism means to you


***The ""real"" text***

In Sweden socialism is getting more rare for everyday and for me who has grown up in a safe

""You want to raise taxes to steal our money""

""You support censorship""

""You support the soviet dictatorship you fuckwad""

And those two last quotes are those who makes me mad.

I will tell you a story about how socialism got big in Sweden

In the early 1930's a bunch of workers on a factory in northern Sweden decided to demonstrate together against the continuing wage cuts. At this time

6000 workers went demonstrating together against the wage cuts. The only answer they got back was bullets

[Read more about the ""Ådalen Shootings"" here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%85dalen_shootings)

This event caused a great political debate in Sweden and The Social Democrats got an extremely high level of trust by the Swedish people

My question is: Why do moderates call us ""communists that supports censorirship"" when the whole ideology mainly is all about the little mans right to demonstrate

The whole Social Democratic Party got support by standing up for the little man's right to use his voice and demonstrate.


One thing more

George Orwell is a great inspiration for me. Many moderates in Sweden constantly call the Social Democrats for causing the ""1984""-society. They love the book ""1984""


**TL;DR Moderates murders the Swedish working class and accuse Socialists to support censorship


I want to learn more about socialism, now the moderates are tearing down this society, making everything more superficial and selfish.

Have you ever been accused for supporting Soviet just because you are a socialist? Whats your answer to them?

Do you agree with what I'm trying to say or am I completely lost? (Wouldn't surprise me

Please have indulgence of my bad English (not even sure if that line is right..)

And please

Have a good day


**Edit:**

**I do really appreciate every single comment here

**I never thought this post was going to get so many answers and big attention.**
