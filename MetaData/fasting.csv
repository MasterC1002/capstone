Since meats are the hardest to digest

My starting weight was 165 and today I am 140. I didn't lose a pound a day on average as I had expected

I actually started trying to lose weight back in the beginning of December, I plan to eat clean 6 days a week and have one cheat meal each week. I plan on sticking with the 23/1 schedule and eating a balanced but satisfying meal every night. I'm going to stay as far away from added sugar as I can. Inevitably, some sugar might sneak into some meals (say if I go out to a restaurant and they serve tomato sauce that has some sugar added to it). I'm going to limit my fruit intake to 1 piece of whole fruit a day. Yes, I know that fruit is healthy for me. But my main goal for now is fat loss, and it is pretty hard to do that when fruit is basically pure sugar. 

In addition to my meals, stopped medication for the fast). I'm also going to take a multivitamin and a fish oil capsule daily. Also, I'll be starting my hormonal birth control pills again which hopefully won't set me off track too much. 

I'm going to get my cholesterol and TSH tested on the 18th and I'll report back to you my findings. I am so excited to see my cholesterol level drop. Before the fast my total cholesterol was through the roof for someone my age (no family history or anything) and my triglycerides were pretty bad too. I've read online, read this article http://www.gaianstudies.org/articles4.htm.

I made this Reddit account (my first) to tell you about my fast




First my stats:

Male

32 years old

5'11""

Starting weight: 187

Ending weight: 170




**Day One**
Though I kept hydrated and drank a moderate amount of coffee, lethargy, etc. Hungry, but not terribly so.

**Day Two**
The toughest day for me. Less of a headache but serious hunger. Lightheaded. Felt a slight bit of ""dislocation"" that I sometimes get when sick -- a sort of distance from my movements and actions. Nothing spacy or out-of-body -- not that severe -- just a kind of weird otherness. Greatly tempted when my mom brought over her slow-cooked Chinese short ribs but I stayed strong.

**Day Three**
Woke feeling great. No headache, buoyant, filled with calm well-being. 

**Day Four**
Another hard day. What got me wasn't hunger, love cooking, love eating, and missed it. Went for a long walk to distract myself. Grew exhausted and weak. Went to bed early.

**Day Five**
Like many others

**Day Six**
Like day five

**Day Seven**
Same as day six. 



**General Observations**

- Dreams: I not only slept poorly (which I guess is common) but had a number of bad dreams. Not nightmares, leading to Dave Five, which were hilarious and happy.)

- ""Clarity of Mind"": A lot of posters note feeling ""clear-headed"" at points during their fast. I never experienced this. Maybe it comes after more days of fasting?

- Boredom: I never realized how much time is taken up by eating, I often felt bored, which almost always led to thought of food during the first four days. (When I fast next, I intend to plan for this.)

- Gas: This is a bit gross -- but even on Day Six I was still letting loose small farts. Some were wet




In summary, two notches off my belt, and had the most delicious salad I've ever tasted for dinner tonight. Definitely plan to do it again.

Stats: Female, SW:149lbs, longest prior fast was 4.5 days.

Day 0 - The day before my fast I actually ate very little

Day 1 - Worked all day at a desk job, but nothing too bad.

Day 2 - Weighed in at 146 pounds.  Didn't do much except some walking and that made it hard to keep my mind off of food.  Headaches were worse but the more water I drank

Day 3 - Weighed in at 144.2 pounds.  Did a lot of heavy cleaning in my old apartment (scrubbed the bathroom, I think it was due to my sore legs.  My goal for the rest of the day is to drink a lot of water because when I'm not thinking about it I often skip hours without it.

Day 4 - Mondays suck even when you are eating, for the most part a fast is a challenge.  It's hard waking up knowing that you will at times feel tired and weak throughout the day, so it helps to keep the end in sight.  I'm halfway there!  I drank a black grande iced coffee from starbucks this morning and it really perked me up, maybe even too much, so I'm gonna hold off on coffee for the remainder of the fast.  I forgot to bring a water bottle to work today so I've been making hourly trips to the water fountain.  Hunger is currently non-existent.  I have a breathing condition that I've had since high school in which I have trouble breathing out and make an occasional wheezing sound.  It has gotten a bit more prominent since the fast began but it usually acts up during exciting and stressful situations.  I'll be back tomorrow for another update! 

Quick nighttime edit - Its a little past midnight and the acid reflux/heartbearn is pretty brutal.  I've been sipping water

Day 5 Morning update! - Last night was really rough so I made the somewhwat hasty decision to drink half a can of swanson fat free low sodium chicken broth.  This is about 12 calories of broth so i realize my fast was compromised at this point but I figured that it was better than giving up.  The pain was so bad that I decided that if conditions didn't impove in the morning, I'm proud of myself for pulling through despite the broth cheat.

END - Well, it wasn't as bad as I thought!

So far I have experienced very minor hunger that usually subsides when I drink water.  I expected to experience the keto flu, which really surprised me!  Normally I snooze my alarm a few time and it takes a lot of will power to jump out of bed, but today I hopped right up as soon as my alarm went off.

I have many reasons for my fast:  I have had an alcohol problem for a long time, that form for no apparent reason.  I believe they are a manifestation of stress built up in my body...stored toxins and other crap that my body just couldn't get rid of during years of excessive drinking and eating garbage.  I've been really healthy the past year or two however, and eat fairly clean, but the lipomas have no gone away.

It is my hopes with this fast, deep healing phase and consume the cysts as a form of energy. I have read other people's experiences and have reason to believe this will work.

ALso, and not drinking and the majority of the lipomas started shrinking on their own...only to come back when I fell off the wagon and started drinking a lot and slowed my exercise.

* 16/8 - [Sure Fire Fat Loss](http://www.leangains.com/2008/06/sure-fire-fat-loss.html) (leangains)
* 19/5 - [Fast-5 Diet](http://www.fast-5.com/)
* 24/256
* 7-10 days

The basic premise is always the same: reset the body's ""need"" for food at specific times and retrain your appetite. Just like Newton's [laws of motion](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton's_laws_of_motion), your rhythm. ~~~Especially around the holidays where seemingly every desk has an extra bowl of candy.~~~ Here are a few things that may be useful during your own fasting:

Tips for before the fast:

* Plan on eating whatever you have on hand and check the expiration dates now.

* Depending on your goal of health, you may not wish to do an easy transition. Instead, feast up! This is your last meal before you get back to eating so you might as well try to pack it in.

* Tell anyone you wish to know you are fasting

Tips during the fast:

* It's important to remain positive and surround yourself with inspiring things &amp; media that which is mood and energy enhancing. 

* Stay busy! Invent a reason to do something where you won't feel distracted or tempted.

* Drink lots of **cold water**

* Fast with someone else - this can keep you from breaking early just considering that you have someone else fasting.

* **Always carry water, or a full glass within sight. ** 

* Water Water Water Water

Tips on after the fast / breakfast:

* Depending on if you are doing a true water fast or a modified version

* Bragg suggests a salad as your first breakfast

* Don't overeat

* Take it easy! No one is likely to snatch your food away. Don't forget to drink plenty of water during and after the transition.

I've lost a lot of weight over the years and credit fasting

* A 3 day fast is useful

* Weigh yourself at the same time every day to get an accurate reading. A good day is a half pound lost, etc.). The point is to not get overexcited or discouraged. *Remember, it took a long time to gain that weight and it's going to take time to lose it.*

* Don't get too caught up w/water only fasts. Instead, that's still a fast, albeit a juice fast. There are no rewards of great fasting and it's not going to be comfortable all the time.

* Have a colon plan. If you are over 30, and help your body to heal itself.

* Come up w/a plan on when you want those 20 pounds off, that's a decision to make (it's ok either way). It's up to you on how hard you want to make this.

* Carry a water bottle everywhere

* Get plenty of rest.

* Laugh

* Go ahead and post to complete step 1 (deciding on a goal and sharing w/us). Good Luck!

1375463788.0,1jkpg2,Testing my willpower -A keto girls 23/1 IF to strictly a water fast journey.,_pishposh_,20,1,33,"I'm posting this because I'm thinking about food and trying to keep myself occupied in a somewhat productive manner.  Im 27, weighing in at 196lbs and started losing about one pound a week.

On Monday, which wasn't that often. I drank a lot of cold water (100+oz/day) as well, to prevent headaches and other yucky feelings. 
Exercise:I did a 3.5 mile walk and then ate a small dinner within my 6-7pm hour until I felt full.

Tuesday: 177.4lbs. I used to weigh this about 2 years ago when I cut out fast food/milkshakes, with my lack of willpower, I fell back into my comfort zone and started 'treating' myself whenever I wanted. But enough about that. Exercise on Tuesday consisted of a 7min HIIT, silly dancing/running in place and bench presses. 

Enter Wednesday, was grumpy all day. Ate dinner around 6 and stayed up too late. Weighed in at 175.6. 


Yesterday (Thurs):
The scale read 174.8 and I fit into a pair of size 12 designer jeans that I haven't worn in the last two years. Surely
Exercise: I ran further than I have in years and completed a 2.5 mile run/walk.

My entire life, I turned around, put it back and told myself I could do this. No food _pishposh_, not today. I had a slight headache around 10pm but that was also probably because I was staring at the computer for too long. Drank more water, went to bed.

Woke up at 6am this morning without the alarm (which never happens)

My mind has stopped racing and is clearer than it has been in months (former ent here). The only thing I'm really contemplating is how long I want to fast for. I have no fears of getting ill from water fasting, I'll try for 7 days. Then, maybe 10. Maybe I'll keep going to 30, who knows. It's a pure willpower test for me and I'm pretty sure if it comes down to eating food or my physical appearance and inner happiness, food will always lose. I have the extra fat to burn (at least 30-40lbs) and the courage to push myself, so I think I'll be at least seeing that 7th day. 

Rambles:
I still don't like looking at myself naked in the mirror. I'm 27

About a month ago, messaged me as a volunteer to mod and it got me thinking about the future direction of this subreddit. I’d like to broaden our focus to not just include food but “abstaining and/refraining from” anything, in other words, fasting in general. For example, you could skip reading reddit for X time, that would a fast. Right now, our X time might be measured in milliseconds

We've come a long way in a short time since I was the only reader. We have inspired each other to know how to successfully start and complete a fast and what to do in between. **Fasting as a growing lifestyle is undeniable.**

I do a 16 hour fast each day followed by an 8 hour eating window.  One thing I've picked up on is to not stress getting food in your stomach right before you begin your fast.  If you're not hungry

Also, eat a little bit more, but I guarantee you won't be hungry.  

Keep busy.  I know it's a really common tip

Break the habits that cause you to eat.  I used to go right to my cabinet where I keep all my food and just look in every time I came up from my basement.  I used to get food, I made a point of not getting anything (even though I did open it).  Now I make it a point of not opening the cabinet.  

Drink a lot of water.  It helps.  That's all for this one.

Learn the difference between being bored and being hungry.  I never understood the difference before I started fasting.  I *knew* sometimes I wasn't really hungry

If possible (given your schedule) eat a serving of vegetables and drink water about 15 minutes before you eat your meal.  This way your brain has had time to send the messages that you've eaten all over your body.  I don't know if this is commonly recommended

Don't keep foods you know you can't turn down.  As you get better self control

I was very skeptical of whether or not fasting would do anything for me

I was 20 years old and knew years of unrelenting acne and excessive perspiration was a sign something wasn't going well. Since about 16, but how many more years would I have to suffer? Honestly, I really didn't expect fasting to do anything note worthy to my body, but it did.

December of my sophomore year of college, dairy, cereals, nuts, fruit and vegetables were eliminated/introduced into my diet (in that order). During the first day of eating nothing, I had to swish water in my mouth to eliminate the awful taste before drinking any, and my armpits were wetter than normal (which is really saying something).

I woke the morning of the second, but I went to bed that night with dry armpits :) Over the course of the next few weeks, I stopped using my perscription-strength acne creams because I had no pimples :D A month later, and I had very clear skin and never had pit-stains, all without applying any creams or anti-perspirants! 

I now do a water fast for 36 - 48 hours once or twice a year, but not the way it used to be or can become if I wait too long to do a fast. As a biochemist, I try to look at this scientifically, but I struggle to find an answer why exactly this happens. Some friends think I am crazy, others think I am a genius and rush off to try something similar. No one has gotten results like I have, but then again, none of my friends have done exactly what I do.

Firstly, I began to feel unwell/nauseous and eventually vomited mere stomach acid. It was a rather unpleasant experience and frightened me into immediate re-feeding, thinking something was terribly wrong. I (think I) recognize now that I’d overextended myself that night swimming lengths, and probably my muscles produced lactic acid which, coupled with the acid already present from lack of digestion, served to throw off the pH of my stomach, the solution being to rid my stomach of acid = my body decided to vomit. I’m wondering, and what exactly was going on at the time? I don’t want to be afraid to pursue activity/exercise

Secondly, right? It would indicate struggle in some way, wouldn’t it? What are some signs I ought to stop? What are some signs I must address something but with a simple fix that would allow me to continue the fast (e.g. the symptoms of a simple depletion of some nutrient or other that, by supplementing, I could dispel and move on from)? In essence, I’d like to know which symptoms would tell me to stop a fast and which would simply tell me to address some need and continue?

Thirdly, any insights, tips, or resources?

Lastly, so I thought I’d link it again in case anyone has not read it and wishes to. It’s well-written and abated my initial hesitation to try an extended fast.

Edit: Broke my fast on Day 12, my older brother and his girlfriend showed up at my doorstep unexpected, a 7-hour drive. ""Surprise! We're only here for a few hours, picking up a dirtbike we're buying from someone on the internet. Let's go to dinner!""  Now, if it were anyone else, I'd either admit my situation or make some sort of excuse, but my brother wouldn't understand, what's the harm? I'll break the fast and then resume in the morning, high-carb...let's just say I had been really pleased with my progress and now I hate myself for ruining it and actually making things worse.

Plan is to start again tomorrow morning; and I endeavour (again) for this fast to be 21-days long, and I will update here every-so-often.

Since starting the water fast, should I choose to eat, I am never more than 30 seconds from being able to do so. Thus for me, fasting is a particular form of control that I have not previously experienced.

I am posting here because I could use your support and backup. I've never been this committed and it feels good. Good enough to want to share. I had this idea, or some similar site and share as much as you can about what you are doing, so, after a while, you have some people who ""follow"" you and in turn, it is much harder to fall off the wagon, when you know someone is rooting for you. Well
I sure would love to talk to like minded people and share experiences with them.

Let me tell you what my nutritional strategy is.

**1) Eat healthier**
I have already adopted

**a) Eat more protein.** LEAN meat, and I'm a big fan of any and all beans.

**b) Eat smaller meals.** Its amazing how little the human body needs to be full and working in proper order

**c) Cut down on the sugars and carbs.** Anything that has flour or sugar on it

**d) Eat more fruits and vegetables.** Not too hard

According to my scale I've lost 4.5 kg in about a  week.

BUT I will not be content with just that. I am looking to integrate fasting. I am working in my willpower and feel like 5/2 is the way to go for me right now.

I was looking into ways to integrate it into my daily life

I got one question though,tea and coffee, if I'm not mistaken.

Wish me luck!

I've previously done a 14 day water fast, but 10 is the minimum. My goal with fasting is weight loss, gaining willpower, and getting in touch with my body.

My water fast isn't truly just water, and mio in my water. Maybe some broth if I'm going crazy. I will also be having vitamins when I feel my body really needs them. 

To get ready for the fast

Today is day 1

Day 2, but I can imagine it will be funny for a few days. I was so so low last night, and I feel really good today. Gotta remember to keep drinking; I'm not doing a dry fast, and I've got to keep my health up.

Day 3, and I don't trust their palates haha. Going out to buy a variety of tasty teas.

Day 4, hunger is starting to stop, energy is super high and sleep is minimal. 

Day 9, sore throat, sneezing, coughing, and major stomach troubles. Like I've had the stomach flu. A lot of burning pain in my stomach and rushing to the bathroom every hour. It's been like this for days now. I had surgery on my stomach a while ago and I throw up blood every so often. I know I have ulcers and I think they're acting up, thus the burning pain.

The first day was easy and I didn't have many cravings. 

The second day

The third day I felt much less hungry, my leg had a fierce pulse twitch and sleeping was hard.

The fourth day was really hard. I had no set day to end the fast as I was playing it by ear, but the hours passed by very, very slowly. I went to the grocery store to acquire coconut water and avocadoes and the smell of bread nearly did me in. I reminded myself that I'm gluten free anyway and gluten-free bread is gross compared to real bread and I carried on. In the evening, I lacked energy and found concentrating to be really hard. I've had the same issue with the ketogenic diet, where my brain never really adapts to running solely on ketones. I had bad dreams and tossed and turned all night.

The reason I was interested in fasting was the documented benefits of reducing inflammation, one stone, you know... I decided to hold off on the medication (for now) and see if I could address the issue myself.

**Edit (End of Day 2, I did not go to the gym like I said I would.  I think it was the feeling of being tired that made me not want to go as that is a side effect of your body switching completely over from carbs to fat as energy.

**Vitimins (Why I'm taking them)**

http://www.imagebam.com/image/e28709245682046

First off, this is rare but something you should be aware of when doing a long fast.  In other words, your heart will spontaneously beat super fast at an uncontrollable rate or super slow at an an uncontrolled rate.  I take Vitimin E for skin elasticity, hoping to reduce stretch marks and excess skin.  However, skin elasticity depends on age a lot more than anything else.  I take the 1 a day multivitimin just in case I might have missed anything else important and the Omega-E  fish oil just because I hear that it's good for you.  :)


**Edit  (Day 3, I'll time it to see how long it lasts.  So far, I have noticed that hunger/food cravings for me would stem from a time of stress especially if I'm playing a competitive video game.  

**Edit (Day 3, I know.  After that I did 3 sets(12 reps per set) of deadlifts at 100 pounds, 3 sets of pulldown bars at 100 pounds, and 3 sets of pushups at 20 each.  Came home and weight at 204.6, which I attribute to the 3 bottles of water I had during my jog at 16.9 ounces per bottle but I am still expecting to be under 203.1 by tomorrow morning after I pee.  I'm not a professional so if someone has a better resistance training routine, I'm all open ears.  I need to do some type of muscle activity to remind my body not to use it as energy.  Also, I did experience a slight need to eat something after my 2 mile jog but it only lasted for like a min.  I just headed off to the weights after that.

**Edit  (End of Day 3, I was able to cut somewhere around 2.3 pounds.  I can say I was only hungry once today and that was after my 2 mile jog but there has been some temptations of food being all around me, especially leftover poboy and fries on the table.  Smells so good but when I got on the scale and saw that I lost a pound after my workout, it gave me more motivation to continue.  Sorry poboy, you don't beat me today!  Tomorrow, I'm expecting the same results as long as I exercise.  Also, taking a picture now to post at the end.

**Edit (Day 4 Morning, not tired, alert, and energetic.  First thing I did when I woke up was weight myself again, this time at 200.6 pounds which means I lost a pound in my sleep again.  In case some are wondering, I did weight myself before I took a piss and I have never in my life pissed a whole pound of water away.  In fact, my scale never seems to register the weight of my piss.  This is interesting to me as the record keeping from day 2 to end of day 3 would suggest that a majority of weight loss happens in my sleep and after exercising.  I know that both sleep and exercise increases HGH proteins for fat burning but then I also know that fasting in general does the same thing.  What I don't know is, off to day 4.  Hope I make it!


**Edit  (Day 4 lunch time)**  I'm going to break my fast.  Yeah


**April 3**  After my fast ended, I ate 3 large bowls of Pho in a day and gained most of my weight back but what I found interesting is that it seems to me that a lot of weight lost in those three days were probably related to carbs as your muscles and liver holds carbs.  When you eat carbs, your body binds carbon molecule with the water that you drink and stores it inside of your body which is what I believe where the weight came from after eating those 3 bowls.  When your muscles and liver run out of places to put the carbs, it will overflow into your gut and other unwanted places in your body.  I believe those 3 big bowls of carbs was more than my muscles could handle as I am sure I could feel some of it being deposited in my gut but maybe I just imagined it?  I believe my weight was 209 the next day after I ate those three bowls.

Anyway, I'm suppose to first fast, then eat 15 mins before my workout, and finally eat a normal meal.  My fasting and meal timing has been a little sporadic but I mainly eat everyday but only after 3pm which means I basically skip breakfast and lunch.  For dinner, I just eat lots of protein because I read that your body doesn't use the extra protein.  You just end up peeing it out.  My dinner has been mainly fish as I like the taste over beef, pork, or chicken.  I just feel that if I'm going to eat only once a day, I am down to 202.6 and I only go to the gym 2 or 3 times a week.  My weight-in for my bet is tomorrow and I've fasted all day since my weight was on the borderline from the other night.  I know from my previous fasting experience that I can drop 2 pounds of weight in a day so that's what I'm doing to ensure I make the cut for tomorrow morning.

**April 8**  My weight in for Dietbet was a few days ago on April 3.  It took two days for them to verify everyone's weight in and I won 66 dollars.  I bought into the pot for 35$.

* 3pm - Preschool soccer. No problems with energy.
* 5:30pm-8:15pm - Class. I had coffee. It was hard because it falls during the dinner hour and I usually grab some cheese cubes and pepperoni slices to tide me over until afterward. My husband and I also usually grab wings at BWW after class on the way home

* Coffee. I typically drink 1-2 cups a day but cut down more each day during a fast; I find as my body cleans out

I'm just curious why someone would do a medically unsupervised 30 day water fast? Or maybe

Maybe I'm confused on what a 30 day water fast consists of here (I've heard people say they are water fasting ... but find out they are actually eating or drinking calories. To me, I've honestly never have heard anyone suggest that unless they were on the old pro-ana/mia websites. I have read absolutely zero literature on fasting that suggests 30 day water fasts (edit: this is false. I should have inserted ""medically unsupervised""). Everything I've read suggests nothing longer than 7 days, max. Most suggest 3 days. If you do the month long ""fasts"", books I read suggest getting that 800 cals through juicing or fruit/veggies. 

I really am not trying to attack. (I do have preconceived notions if your answer is purely to ""lose weight""). But I'm curious about other reasons (like religious or spiritual, I'm curious about what literature you've read. Or what influenced you to go the fasting route to detox.

* Day 2: Kept hands and mind busy as much as possible no real hunger pains to speak of.
* Day 3: DAS HUNGER
* Day 4: same as day three in every way but one
* Day 5: Woke feeling pretty dam spry with no hunger and only a slight tinge of head pain day went well.
* Day 6: today: same as day five no hunger and a nice little increase in energy did smell fresh baked bread in the supermarket and that kinda felt like someone shanked me but fine other than that all is well.

I want to be &lt;200lbs by the end of the fast and i think i can do it. i have lost 12 lbs already i know most is water weight but even having the weight of me makes me feel better and more confident.

While very overweight I am very active so not too much was water weight as I had experienced in the past.  Back in December my A1C came out 5.2 and as long as I stay in the right direction food/exercise wise my diabetes battle is over with me victorious.  I am not on any meds as my blood pressure and all are normal.  I have completed a 7 day water fast back in March 2012 so I kinda knew what to expect.

The first 2 days were typically difficult however not too bad.  I did work out on day 2 as normally I work out 3-4 times a week.  Got really tired at the end of the workout and decided I had done enough and it was time to let my body catch back up with energy.

Days 3-5 were fairly typical

Day 6 I started feeling really hungry again.  I was feeling bad both mentally and physically.  Urine was dark orange

I am not sure what was different this time other than it seemed maybe I did not condition myself enough prior or something.  I think my liver must have been making too much bile or something to have caused such dark urine.  I made sure to drink plenty of water.  I did make sure to eat veggies the 2 days prior to beginning the fast.  

I feel fine now(2 days after) however I am itchy all over and still have orange urine so I am not sure my liver has returned to normality.  Overall I feel fine

This was my experience going almost 6 days water fast.  I am curious if anyone might have any insight on why day 6 was rough?

As we know, ideally in moderation. However, often fasting depletes the body, causing a baseline deficiency.

I'm no newbie to fasting - I've been implementing a combination of LeanGains and EatSTOPEat for a long time now. What I'm not used to is being sick. I only get sick once or twice a year, but in retrospect, that only seems to do good in the short-term.

I currently am in my 6th day… Getting tempted every day
I have been a binge eater ever since I recovered from anorexia.

Now I go anywhere from 115-125 from constant binging/restricting.

After a day of trying to eat clean

Now the problem is
My original intention was to fast for about 20 days

I know that I will be able to eat healthy
But I am still scared that I will binge every day.
Every day is a constant battle with an inner voice in me.
I do not know what to do… What should I do?

I currently have lost 10 lbs from 122lb. I was 112 last night.
If I eat though
I have noticed as long as I am below 115lb

Now my question is
I promise myself and to God
Do you guys think I will be able to keep the weight that I have lost..?
Or do you think I should keep on fasting (with a risk of binging every single day) for about 2 weeks?

I don’t know if this makes sense.. I just feel desperate…

I went out to a fondue restaurant on Friday and it seemed to have opened up a binge door for the rest of the weekend. 

TMI Sorry Last night was so bad for me I woke up almost every 10 minutes because I was so gassy and needed to use the restroom. I was not even sure I woud be able to make it to work today as I do tech support on chats all day and was worried about the bathroom.

Needless to say I went to work and drank lots of water and some jasmin tea as well as black [Pu_erh](http://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEQQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPu-erh_tea&amp;ei=zZtsUdj4B_K40AHLmICwBw&amp;usg=AFQjCNGW9viZ8ZOfaj2V0Ik48yYn6UpmcA&amp;sig2=yj3bFqhWBjtqxzl0o7BHbg&amp;bvm=bv.45175338

Well here we are 8:31pm and it appears that I have gone a full day with fasting so I decided to see how far along I can go. I read up on the benefits of fasting today and am setting a small goal of 5 days. I am not sure if I will be able to go that long but I will take it one day at a time. 

Here are a few of my questions. I am sorry if they have been answered before. I am kindda cranky atm due to lack of sleep and I want to make sure I go about this right. 

1. Is it ok for me to even drink teas while I am fasting? If so are black tea ok or should I really stick to green teas. I only drink real tea from tea leaves so is it ok to use some fruity one as well? I do not like sweeteners so I will be staying away from those but what about lemon wedges are they ok in there?
2. I normally take a multi vitamin daily to make sure I get all my nutrients is it ok to continue with this?
3. How safe will it be for me to go full keto once I decide to be done with this fast?
4. I am feeling somewhat of a fait headache so I will be going to bed but is it ok to take Ibuprofen if it gets to be too much?
Thanks for your input it is much appreciated.

How did it go? Surprisingly well in fact. As it as been said everywhere, for the sugary taste.

I ate cottage cheese and a fistful of nuts before workout. Did a body attack session + weight training. I was worried about hypoglycemia to be frank. But I didn't encounter the slightest warning sign of it. Of course the weight training

After that I ate a post workout meal, eggs, veggies. I almost had to force myself to eat as I wasn't really hungry. The worst part? Forcing myself to drink a protein shake before going to bed.
And today? Back to fasting

26 year old Male

5'10 215lbs (Heaviest was 234lbs when I started the warrior diet)

I am just stuck at 215. I cannot stand counting calories and I think that is why I am stuck right now. I am considering going back on the warrior diet to shed the last 15 lbs. I am a pretty built guy with thick legs and broad shoulders. I do have a spare tire I am trying to get rid of by July 12th for a beach trip.

I was in the gym before work but had recently quit when I got a new job that demands so much and on call rotation. I have a wife and a kid and totally exhausted when I get home from work. 

I haven't really done a water fast before but I was very accustome to the warrior diet because that is how I mainly ate while in the Marine Corps. It was just too hot while deployed to Iraq to eat during the day. I didn't realize it but that is basically the warrior diet.

My theory here is that the servings of cream in a delicious cup of coffee dispersed over this 24 hour period will help keep me from getting hungry or feeling deprived.

Now because heavy cream is almost entirely water and fat

Would I remain in a fasted state for the majority of that time? Does anyone know of any research of fasting with small amounts of fat?

Been lurking for a while and generally it seems all my questions are asked (and answered by other people). 

I am trying the alternate day fasting approach i.e.

Monday Wednesday Friday and Sunday I eat 500 to 600 calories in the space of 4 hours usually in the evening
The remaining days I fast for 16 hour and count my calories but generally wind up between 1800 to 2000 calories on those day.

This approach has been working great till now and I am down 7 Kgs and more than 4 inches off my waist in 38 days.

I have tried a low carb high protein diet in the past and have managed to lose a significant amount of weight but i had to quit that on account of a severe gout problem. 

Now I have a sharp pain in my foot and I am assuming it is gout. I am trying to eat healthy and don't have any meat on the fasting days. I also have a lot of water ( between 7 - 8 litres ) daily. I have just started having a lot of green tea as well. Anything else I should be doing to help the gout pain.

Also I have having sleep issues i.e. I am sleeping 10 hours plus daily and cant seem to wake up in the morning and am exhausted daily.

Since then, but my wife makes our bread from scratch with whole wheat. I also eat occassionally a potatoe or some other simple starch. For the most part, though, it's just been meat and vegetables and fats and other healthy food.

I have read

**So for those who have studied this much more than I have, or thoughts on the long-term effects of intermittent fasting?**


I'm seriously considering never giving this up at this point. The mild hunger pains don't even begin to compare with how amazing I feel.

A nice side effect is that I've gone from 200lbs. to about 188lbs. in three weeks. At least 4-5bls. were lost within the first couple days

My weight loss should be more controlled at this point, I'm definitely still shedding pounds at an alarming rate.

---------------------------
**Day 1:** Really difficult.  I haven't been doing any form of fasting for at least 2 weeks and I always break my fast this way within 12 hours, and I'm determined to complete at least four days (as that seems to be when most people start feeling better).  Overall I want to say I'm determined to get to 17 days but it's feeling a little crazy!

**Day 2:** A little better today, I've actually been very productive and only slightly irritable.  I've been having a lot of coffee and water, and I know that it's advised against but I have a lot of 0 calorie/sugar drinks.  Trying to have them as a last resort!  I wanted to note about the coffee, and perhaps this is common sense - when I have my usual coffee, heavy cream, and Splenda, I feel exhausted almost immediately after consuming.  Just having coffee and a bit of Splenda is affecting me the way I think it's supposed to?  Feeling energetic afterwards.  I also had one piece of sugar free gum, I started counting after I noticed it was still going.  haha. I also noticed I've been grinding my teeth since about 12 hours in?  I don't realize I'm doing it most of the time - has anyone else had this issue?  I did fall asleep at 12 last night as opposed to the usual 2-3.  I'm confident I can make it to tomorrow morning
