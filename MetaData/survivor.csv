There were actually about 50 Survivors there, Panama, Cook Islands, and HvV signed by people from those seasons: http://i.imgur.com/GUP64Wp.jpg And then I got the back of a poster signed by everyone else: http://i.imgur.com/iLoPm6o.jpg And yes, Billy made the crossbones in the middle....


So here are some of the standout interactions I had with people:


Corinne- She was seated next to Phillip the Specialist


Jaime (Survivor China)- I told her I felt so bad about her fake idol, and their son was with them, loved that!


Sandra- I congratulated her on being the only two-time winner


Yau-man - I told him how sorry I was for Dreamz not giving him the car back. He said it's alright and he was so happy and awesome. 


Ozzy- was the only person all day who wasn't friendly at all. A friend of mine went too and she said the whole time she talked to him


Jane (Nicaragua)- definitely the most interesting conversation all day. I asked her if it was true if Sash really did break the rules


Bob (Gabon)- The woman behind me told him he looks like Bill Nye the Science Guy so much. Bob said he has been mistaken for Bill Nye twenty seven times. 


Aras (Panama)- I congratulated him on winning the first time he played and said I hope he does well next season. He said ""me too. fingers crossed."" Then I asked if he liked playing more the first time or second


Fabio- He talked about how everyone on his season got along pretty well


Terry (Exile Island)- He said that he was supposed to be on Blood vs Water next season


Erik (Micronesia and Caramoan)- We talked about Reddit and how he wants it to become the more popular site for Survivor fans over Survivor Sucks


If anyone has questions about how any of the other tons of Survivors were

* Then Cochran wins the freaking challenge... followed by excessive celebration... followed by Cochran explaining that no one else would get away with such a celebration

* Then we move on to strategy

* Then we move on to Corrine - a returning player who ought to know better - being unable to keep her mouth shut and fucking up the entire anti-Stealth plan.

* Then we have the renewed Stealth-R-Us alliance, one of the best executed blindsides since a string of them in FvF1.  If the editing was accurate, it was done quickly, secretly, and with minimal discussion.  Everyone recognized what needed to be done, and did it.",,self,Brenda,

 Before I introduce myself, an award that you should truly receive every year. 

 My name is Jono. I have watched Survivor since day one. I have listened to every interview I could get my hands on, I would have auditioned every year since season one, and I have kept myself in shape just in case such an event occurs. 

 The reason that I am writing is because of the recent, verging towards hatred. I consider this to be an ignorant and foolish way to approach someone who has as much experience, care, dedication, and love of the game of Survivor as you must have. 

 It is my intention to distill out the basic essence of what this rabble is attempting to state

There are two subjects that I will be broaching. The first is the narrative nature of a show like Survivor. Above anything else, or spark, to make the show worth watching. 

 The most brilliant narratives have always been the ones that emerge naturally from the game. I go all the way back to season one; Richard Hatch, that it was your hope that Rudy would win the game, and when Hatch won, you thought the game was finished. However, the exact opposite happened. The preconceived notion that a former marine winning Survivor would be the most powerful narrative fell by the way side as a homosexual corporate manager who created the first alliance in Survivor history rocketed to the top. His story emerged as the narrative arc of the entire season. 

 In recent seasons it has become apparent that the emerging storylines are beginning to be put aside in favor of a preconceived notion of what the narrative should be. The most telling evidence of this is the near elimination of Brenda and Erik from the narrative of the show in favor of screen time for Cochrane, win. 

 The thought process to this is very clear. By showing more of Cochrane it is your hope to create a star, while also setting Cochrane up to return again, and be a long time mainstay of the show. 

 There is a difficulty to this line of thinking. At its core, even if he lacks the ability to articulate why this is the case. People are naturally repelled by what they subconsciously perceive as untrue. 

 So, and completely nonstrategic. The frustration is that many of his secret scenes revealed a far more acute understanding of Survivor then the show itself revealed. It revealed a narrative of a person who could very well win the game. His injury, which was apparently ongoing and also explains his desire for food, adds an element of tragedy into the game, because Erik stands as a figure who was within striking distance of victory, only to have it taken away from him in a twist of fate. 

 By not revealing Erik's narrative in order to thrust Cochrane's into the foreground

 The ultimate reality is that it is clear that you don't care much for a certain type of player. You have stated it explicitly. However, there are many people who find those figures fascinating, if not the main reason they watch the show. 

 By pushing them into the background, or Shamar. These people are not stupid, or mistaken in their views. They are following their hearts, and by rendering the people they love invisible, or inconsequential to the overall structure of the narrative, you unintentionally insult them, and diminish their interest in Survivor. This is why people are reacting so abrasively. 

 I do respect that this is, it should be apparent that those who love Survivor desire something deeper from it other then the mindless entertainment of other reality shows. The gimmicks, explosive characters, and forced conflicts reveal a compromise to the essence of what the show is about; a group of strangers creating a society on an island, and voting one another out with the winner being judged by their peers. I have witnessed a steady decline away from the social experimentation and dignity of the show into a form of side-show entertainment. 

 This leads to the second subject. I feel that this tenancy has emerged because of the natural stagnation of the strategic element of the game. It has become very clear that the natural strategy of the game is to create an alliance of five, and then ride two alliances within the five to be assured a position at the top. You have stated this strategy yourself, and it has made for an extremely stagnant strategic game. This stagnation evolved completely naturally as people, through the years, figured the game out. The solution that you seem to be resting on is to have big personalities, and characters who will act in erratic ways as often as possible. In this way you hope to shake the game up and make it interesting watchable television. 

 I wish to encourage you to take a different approach. I have watched all of the seasons of survivor, has been season twenty five. The three tribe format should become the new format for the show. This simple structural change will have major implications for the strategic nature of the show, and will always result in difficult situations and choices for the players involved, without relying on them to be erratic or unpredictable people. 

 The three tribe format has, and attempt to leverage their own small group into a better position. Larger groups will be picked apart by two smaller only to have one of the two smaller break off and target their former allies. This type of situation will result in a completely new way to approach the game, and would spark a new era of Survivor. In such an environment, it would be completely unnecessary to fill the game with kooks, and explosive personalities. The natural emergent storylines that would emerge from a more unstable structural game would be brilliant, and above all, more honest. 

 It is my sincerest hope that you will return to an era where the narrative of the game is more important then the narrative of an individual person

At last night's tribal

Instead

Why? Multiple reasons

Had he been more covert about it, which was to sacrifice himself to make sure that both idols got played. It gives his alliance a much better shot when next week's tribal council rolls around if the smaller alliance of three has no idols to use to wield power to flip the others.

Don't get me wrong

BUT...

For as much as I've thought this Stealth 'R' Us thing was total bullshit, at his own expense, and got rid of the threat to his alliance to give them a better shot at making it to the end.

It's the one beautiful and selfless thing I've seen him do on Survivor

My friend Nate's wife wanted him to have a birthday party where we played Survivor.  I begged her to let me help plan it and delay it until July when my wife and I were in Michigan.  We had a solid 6 months of planning.

After seeing a post on /r/survivor that Erik was auctioning off his shoes he wore on Fans vs Favorites 2 for his girlfriend Dana's charity Project A2.  I knew I had to get these shoes for Nate's birthday.  I won!  What started as a text joke to Carla that we should invite Erik and Dana to come to the party ended up being a very real and serious idea.  After I won the shoes

The game was played at a house on Wolverine Lake MI.  We had access to use three backyards and the shore of the lake.  There were 16 players.  8 fans of the show Survivor and 8 newbs who knew nothing about Survivor (except bi weekly newsletters we sent out).  I was able to host the game and Nate's wife Carla came up and created majority of the challenges.  The game lasted over 9 hours and involved plenty of beer.  Spectators said they enjoyed watching the entire game and all the players had the time of their life.

We got pictures and video of all the challenges but we're still waiting for people to upload them.  I began creating an album so you guys could see some of it. The whole time I was hosting the game

My wife came in second and the her best friend Alyssa (a newb) won the game 6-1.  She donated all of the prize money to Project A2.  Lots of descriptions of the challenges and players are in the album.

Being the host of the game came second nature to me.  I've seen every season multiple times and I've wanted to throw a Survivor game for over ten years.  I didn't have to practice what I was going to say in the game, acted in challenges and played the game.  My wife who knew NOTHING about what we had in store for this game, was a completely different person when playing this game.  Even though we only did this over a day, we're still talking about what would have happened if alternative scenarios occurred while she played.  

Without a doubt we're going to play this again next year.  It's going to be bigger and better.  I can't reveal anything for 2014 because we want to invite /r/survivor to audition and play next year.  I can say that it will take place over 2 days instead of 1.  Erik and Dana said they would be willing to come again. Judging by the look on their faces

I will keep you guys posted on updates as soon as I get more pics and vids.  It really was an awesome time.

Now this happens every season unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that most moderators of this subreddit are inactive. There have been two spoilers posted in the last couple days that have gone over 15 hours without being removed. This is completely unacceptable. After the mishandling of the Clayburn incident earlier in the year, in which the moderators went against the collective majority and tried to force Clayburn on us, and the ridiculous amount of reposted topics in recent days,  it has become increasingly clear that those currently in charge are incapable of doing the job to a satisfactory level.

 One of the things I adore doing with survivor is writing up lengthy, at some point. I've really been holding off on this season for two reasons. A) The pre-merge game of this season was particularily absurd. B) The merge itself was particularily chaotic, and there were just too many unknowns. I feel like the game has stabalized now, and it's worth doing. 

 Warning: I guarentee this will be long. There will not be a TL;DR. Hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoy writing it. 

 Oh

http://imgur.com/TsdfhkP 

I'll start with the guys who I think are sunk. 

Reynold: This guy seems like a really nice guy who messed his game up extremely early on. Getting into an overt alliance of four is just an extremely bad idea that exploded in his face. Since then he's really been trying to make something happen

Malcolm: I straight up think Malcolm's own cockiness cost him this game. I think he looked at Dawn and Andrea and thought ""There's a nice old lady and a dumb blonde I can manipulate."" He did not respect these players and it's going to cost him hard. They played him big time. 

 He does have a super secret idol that only he knows about. There is no way he doesn't play that next time. His best case is to take out someone like Andrea

 Unless Malcolm starts winning immunities left right and center

Eddie: This chap really hooked onto the Reynold train and it's just been his downfall at every turn. Eddie definately holds the opinion that being a strong, and he's expected special treatment because of it the whole time. This, to me, is the heart of the failing of his game. He sees himself as a natural leader and expects people to listen to him, but it's just never been that way in this game. 

 His only saving grace is that he is working with Andrea. While he did vote against her last tribal, he might step into a useful pawn position for Andrea, but that's the extent of his game. 

 My gut is telling me that Andrea will try to keep him around after Malcolm and Reynold go, which it won't, she'll give him up. He served his purpose with this last episode anyway. 

 My gut tells me Eddie goes home after Malcolm and Reynold. 

Sherri: I like Sherri. I really do. But there's just no way Eddie goes and Sherri doesn't. I definately think there's enough of a push of ""Favorites to the end"" that they're not going to be interested in keeping a fan around for someone to use as a pawn. Phillip is the controlling player here

 So, Reynold, and Malcolm are already done in this game. Baring some kind of immunity run, or idol mania, I just don't see how it goes any other way. The Favorites are showing every sign of sticking it out to the end, and that means eliminating the Fans, and anyone who allied with the Fans. 

 The Favorites

 Andrea: I've been pretty impressed with Andrea

 I'm glad she convinced Dawn to stick with Michael. It was the strongest move

 The question now is how does she find her way into the final three. What I've really been liking about Andrea is her fluidity. Right from day one she's made it a point to work every side and work every angle she can. This means that there are a few avenues that she might take to get into the final three

 I think Andrea is extremely aware what the sub-alliance structure of the ""Stealth R Us"" alliance. Her first target is going to be Dawn or Cochran

 If she can manage to convince Phillip to take out Dawn, that's how she gets into the final three with a winning vote. She'll be sitting beside a buffoon that no one will vote for, and someone who didn't do anything the whole game. It seems to be her best shot at winning. 

Phillip: The tragic aspect of Phillip is that he's actually playing a good game. The problem is that he has such a repellant personality that no one will respect it. You just cannot win the game by pissing people off the whole time and declaring yourself the best. 

 Phillip is going to act in his own best interests though

 I honestly don't know who Phillip will target first. I think he really wants to sit at the final three with Brenda and Erik so that he can be the only one left with claim on the strategy aspect of the game. 

 I can see a situation play out where Phillip and Andrea target Dawn and Cochran

 If this plays out, without question, play the stronger strategic game. There is a thresh-hold to how much a player will take the ""I played a strategic game"" arguement before ""You were a fucking prat"" overrides it. Russel Hantz proved that twice, and Phillip, if he makes it, will again. 

Dawn: I'm in love with Dawn's game. I don't fully understand the crying, but I'm not convinced it will be enough. 

 Her first target is probably going to be Andrea. I can see a scenario in which Brenda and Erik vote along with her and Cochran to make that happen. The problem is that

 Survivor has a long history of middle aged women placing fourth. Everyone just knows that if you let a middle aged woman into the final three, you're going to lose. 

 And I strongly believe Cochran will turn on Dawn if it comes down to it. While this time would be a bit more personal of a betrayal

 I see Dawn making it to fifth or fourth before going. If she makes it to the end, but I have a hard time seeing it. 

Cochrane: I actually think Cochrane's in the best position. I don't think he'll be the first one targeted come the final six

 Like Dawn, in which case, he was screwed from the get. 

 I think Cochran's final three strategy is Him, who are essentially doing the same thing at this moment; floating. 

Erik/Brenda: These two are just laying low and biding their time. I think this is a perfectly valid strategy

 I think Erik is banking on the idea that he's going to get to the final six and be able to go on an immunity run. This was evident when he chose to go with the Favorites alliance instead of jump ship with Malcolm. He just looked at the competition, a nerd, an injured hot lady, and a regular hot lady, then three strong men any day."" Brenda is probably thinking the same thing. 

 I do think Brenda is hoping she can just slip in to the final three Sandra style. ""Just send home anyone but me."" 

 In the end

 Still though

Conclusion: While it would make for excellent television, and they vote out Andrea. 

 In a funny little twist of fate

 Imagine that scene. Erik and Brenda together

Erik: So... who are you voting for? 
 
Brenda: I dunno. Who are you voting for?

At the end of the day, and he's posed to execute that plan. 

 Final Closing Thought: All of this could be tanked by idols and immunity runs. It's just possible that one person is invincible the whole time. Or even a couple people just get picked off because of idols. That's what makes survivor great. Anything can happen. 

Phew! Big long one. If you got this far

1360891309.0,18jy5q,Week One : Power Rankings,CharliePancakes,56,3,16,"20 . Francesca : She made history last night by being the first survivor to be voted off first twice. She probably isn't the worst player ever but she has always played to hard and never knew how to be patient and quiet.

19 . Allie : The last person brought into the cool lunch table alliance she has also been the most obvious member (despite what Reynold intended) by her night time behaviors with Reynold. She also lacks the physical ability of the boys and Hope is a pre law student with Southern charm who was also a charter member in the alliance. If a cool kid is going it'll likely be Allie.

18 . Brenda : Brenda was immediately recognized as a threat and most of the favorites haven't made any contact to her. She was Francesca's right hand woman. Although she's good in challenges but so are Erik and Brandon and they are both perceived to be far less strategic and intelligent than Brenda.

17 . Brandon : Brandon may have attempted to start a sequel to the Mikayla saga with Andrea but luckily it failed. None the less he was good in challenges and people found themselves surprisingly liking him. However between spearheading the anti andrea alliance

16 . Erik has already shown himself to be subtle and observant to what is going on coupling this with his challenged prowress and you have a dream survivor player. Unfortunately I'll have to put Erik this low because he put himself on the wrong side of the numbers despite knowing what was up. However the fact that he is not intimidated by other players like he was in his last season is a beacon of hope for our favorite ice cream scooper.

15 . Shamar : Shamar has had some very peculiar behavior so far. He did well in challenges. Refused to do work at camp. Got in a fight. Then invented fire winning the tribes respect. Shamar is a huge wildcard which could either benefit him or screw him over. However Shamar does seem to be somewhat aware to how he's perceived by the damage control he's done (usually right after he upset or shocked someone).

14 . Hope : Hope was quickly added to the cool lunch table alliance but that is more a negative at this point. She will be picked off early on in the alliance simply because of Reynold and Eddie's physical prowress.

13 . Julia : Let's be honest Julia wasn't seen much this episode. She's under the radar and in an alliance of four (actually 3 + 2 maybes) so I guess kudos to her.

12 . Eddie : Eddie does not seem aware that this is Survivor not the bachelorette but either way he will likely be kept along simply so that the Fans can compete against the favorites in challenges.

11 . Sherri : Pretty much Julia's entry but her out of Survivor credentials have me thinking she could be a real threat.

10 . Andrea : Andrea received 4 votes yesterday and has drawn suspicion from everyone except her true foursome alliance. Dawn and Cochran are already suspicious of her and she's been caught double dealing. Luckily for her she's in the core with Phillip and he probably see's her as his greatest ally. Interestingly enough Andrea and Ralph are the only Redemption Island contestants that Phillip didn't seem to have any true malice for (except for maybe Ralph being a Zapatera).

9 . Reynold : I had high hopes for Reynold and he's been half meeting my expectations. He's been great with challenges, intelligent, and charming.

8 . Matt : Matt seems a lot more low key and humble than I would have expected a Lex/Rupert hybrid to be. He doesn't seem to be too good at challenges but between his alliance with Michael and his hardwork attitude he will be around for a while.

7 . Malcolm : Malcolm had a very quiet episode. However he was perceived by the Francesca alliance as being very tight with Phillip. He did well in the challenges despite losing immunity and being under the radar is probably for the best because it's the opposite of what Russell does. Knowing Malcolm from last season he is likely employing his fall of an empire stategy that he did with Swan on Phillip. Meaning let them think they're the leader

6 . Laura : Outside of Michael Laura seems to be the most observant of the fans. She's already in an alliance to target the cool kids and with numbers she should be able to have control.

5 . Phillip : Say what you will about him but he's actually played well tonight. He didn't get in a fight over crispy rice

4 . Dawn : Cochran was right we can all see a new Dawn. She isn't bitter and is all about business and making the right moves. She and Cochran will decide on who goes on the favorites tribe and she may be more dangerous than people assume.

3 . Corinne : Corinne seems to be the second most liked person on her tribe to the point that Francesca suggesting her name might have killed any lingering thought of joining in her war against Phillip for good. Corinne is a core member of Stealth r us 2 and should be around for a while.

2 . Michael : Michael is easily the best fan. He knows what to do

1 . Cochran : He was nervous,,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,True

----------------------

Hello /r/survivor

I've noticed some people have to watch the show on a delay or have to wait more than a day. I wouldn't mind streaming the entire finale + the reunion show for the community tonight.

The only downside is I live on the US West so I will be 3 hours behind the East.

I will add a countdown to the stream once I make sure everything is ready to go. This is my first time streaming so pray I don't run into issues.

I am running a test stream right now. Please check it out and let me know if any of you have issues.

**Countdown:** Over

**Stream:** [Offline](http://twitch.tv/redditSurvivor)

^2 I will add a countdown timer for when the stream starts within the next hour or so.

The reason for this? Unbalanced editing. Yes, 8/19 players didn't get a single confessional. But we did get to see Phillip introduce all 6 members of his alliance to the cameramen. Now I like Phillip, but some balance would be appreciated!

The following is just speculation

[](/s ""Another huge issue with unbalanced editing, and does not have a shot at winning. Based on the editing alone, for the favourites we can easily say that Brenda and Corinne have no shot, and Erik is essentially in the same boat. For the fans, Julia has no shot. All three (or four) could make it to the merge, but none will win. Why? We've barely seen them. There's no way a winner would be so non-existent in the first three episodes. Now you could argue that Natalie White didn't get a confessional until episode 4, she was on a season with Russell, Reynold has the most

To clear up any potential confusion: what I mean by schoolyard pick 'em is each person picks the next, either by a reward challenge win, or by random draw, or some other concoction.

Also: Considering challenge performance will not actually be as important as a strong social game, Todd, MAYBE EVEN SOME WOMEN?!?! (hah, right... women... good luck selling that to the producers).

Challenge-Throwing: Many people have been voicing concerns about the possibility that a team would be strongly inclined to pick strong players not in their alliance and throw the challenge to get rid of them.  Rather than reply to each of these people, therefore any strategizing would have to take part beforehand, and it would all go to shit if the other team picks one of the necessary components to the plan.  On top of that, Exile Island plays a factor.  If the other team decides to send to Exile Island the player you threw the challenge to vote out, then you have to target one of your own.  What if he has an immunity idol? Accepting the possibility of a combined reward/immunity, why give up reward and put yourself at risk of elimination at the same time? How big would your alliance have to be? 12? 14?  You are really counting on the loyalty of THAT many people?  Really?  REEEEALLY??? No smart player would EVER consider this strategy with so many variables.  The end.  

Any season that had tribe swaps put people in MUCH BETTER position to throw challenges, it was to eliminate somebody who was a burden to camp-life, not a strong player.  In conclusion: challenge throwing simply would not happen, and even if it did, it would add a new strategic depth to the game that makes the boot order far less predictable week to week.

**Analysis #1: Which seasons are the top ten seasons of Survivor?**

Let’s say you’re interested in the top ten seasons.  The order/ranking of these top ten seasons don’t much matter to you (stick with me, it still falls in the top ten range, and counts equally as a season that was voted as the absolute best.  So with that explanation, the top ten seasons based on r/Survivor's votes are:

10) Season 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands) – 46 votes  
9) Season 17 (Gabon – Earth’s Last Eden) – 47 votes  
8) Season 1 (Borneo) – 52 votes  
7) Season 13 (Cook Islands) – 55 votes  
6) Season 6 (Amazon) – 60 votes  
5) Season 25 (Philippines) – 68 votes  
3-tie) Season 15 (China) – 82 votes  
3-tie) Season 16 (Micronesia – Fans Vs. Favorites) 82 votes  
2) Season 7 (Pearl Islands) – 83 votes  
1) Season 20 (Heroes vs. Villans) – 85 votes  

Looking at the other end of the spectrum

17) Season 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire) – 25 votes  
18-tie) Season 3 (Africa) – 20 votes  
18-tie) Season 4 (Marquesas) – 20 votes  
20-tie) Season 11 (Guatemala – The Mayan Empire) – 18 votes  
20-tie) Season 21 (Nicaragua) – 18 votes  
22) Season 14 (Fiji) – 14 votes  
23) Season 22 (Redemption Island) – 9 votes  
24) Season 24 (One World) – 6 votes  
25) Season 5 (Thailand) – 5 votes  
26) Season 23 (South Pacific) – 4 votes  
  
  
**Analysis #2 – That list is fine and dandy

Okay, and each vote for tenth-best season only gets one point (you can do the math in the middle).  Under this method, here’s r/Survivor's weighted top ten:

10) Season 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands) – 247 Points  
9) Season 17 (Gabon – Earth's Last Eden) – 269 Points  
8) Season 1 (Borneo) – 279 Points  
7) Season 13 (Cook Islands) – 291 Points  
6) Season 6 (The Amazon) – 301 Points  
5) Season 25 (Philippines) – 324 Points  
4) Season 15 (China) – 480 Points  
3) Season 7 (Pearl Islands) – 507 Points  
2) Season 16 (Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites) – 609 Points  
1) Season 20 (Heroes vs. Villains) – 662 Points  

As for the bottom ten....

17) Season 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire) – 115 Points  
18) Season 4 (Marquesas) – 109 Points  
19) Season 3 (Africa) – 101 Points  
20) Season 11 (Guatemala – The Mayan Empire) – 76 Points  
21) Season 21 (Nicaragua) – 68 Points  
22) Season 14 (Fiji) – 46 Points  
23) Season 5 (Thailand) – 23 Points  
24) Season 22 (Redemption Island) – 20 Points  
25) Season 24 (One World) – 18 Points  
26) Season 23 (South Pacific) – 9 Points  
  
  
**Analysis #3: Nope

I admit, will you buy the argument that everyone who responded at least knows what their top season is?  Alright, so let’s take a look at **just the votes for being top-ranked** and see what the data tells us (too many ties to rank):

**0 votes:** 5 (Thailand), 21 (Nicaragua), 22 (Redemption Island), 23 (South Pacific), 24 (One World)  
**1 vote:** 2 (The Australian Outback), 11 (Guatamala – The Mayan Empire), 12 (Panama – Exile Island)  
**2 votes:** 6 (The Amazon), 26 (Caramoan – Fans vs. Favorites)  
**4 votes:** 8 (All-Stars), 25 (Philippines)  
**6 votes:** 15 (China)  
**7 votes:** 17 (Gabon – Earth’s Last Eden)  
**11 votes:** 1 (Borneo)
**18 votes:** 16 (Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites)
  
  
**Analysis #4: Wait

Haven’t forgotten about that one!  Here’s the tally for that question as well:

**0 votes:** 3 (Africa), 9 (Vanuatu – Islands of Fire), 10 (Palau), 12 (Panama – Exile Island), 15 (China), 16 (Micronesia – Fans vs. Favorites), 20 (Heroes vs. Villains)
**1 vote:** 1 (Borneo), 11 (Guatemala – The Mayan Empire), 17 (Gabon – Earth's Last Eden), 18 (Tocantins – The Brazilian Highlands), 19 (Samoa)  
**2 votes:** 4 (Marquesas)
**3 votes:** 14 (Fiji)
**6 votes:** 21 (Nicaragua)  
**7 votes:** 23 (South Pacific)  
**9 votes:** 5 (Thailand)  
**17 votes:** 24 (One World)  
**42 (!!!) votes:** 22 (Redemption Island)
  
  
**Analysis #5: Screw you and your basic analysis.  Give me the data and I’ll come up with my own conclusions

Well, here’s the answer matrix from the first question: http://i.imgur.com/ZqRCI5Y.png
  
  
**Analysis #6: Not interested in the raw data anymore.  With the recent events going on

Sure, here’s a map of where the 100 responses came from: http://tinyurl.com/n5rmo4n Personally I wouldn't be surprised if some IP forwarding was happening (I'm looking at you Mongolia!), but thought it was worth sharing to see the geographical spread of where the responses came from.

There wasn't anything truly unique to this season, merge at 10, final 2. This season was a standard game of Survivor.

**The Winner: Richard Hatch**

Episode 1 quote, wiped out the entire opposing tribe,took all four members of his alliance to the final 4, and still maintained jury votes. 

**Characters**

- **Richard**: The FNF, and strategic game. 
- **Kelly**: Was in the alliance
- **Rudy**: Always on the chopping block early for being bossy and abrasive. The island chef who had little strategic game, not so much.
- **Sue**: The only other real strategic player this season. Lies and goes against her word from day 1. Stays strong with the alliance until the end.
- **Greg**: The ivy league nature goofball. Inventor of the ""nature"" phone. An all around great character
- **Colleen**: America's first Survivor sweetheart. Started playing the game one tribal too late.
- **Gervase**: Completely out of his element. Couldn't really swim
- **Jenna**: Innocent
- **Sean**: The inventor of the ""Super-Poll"" fishing rod. Voted alphabetically

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: This season of Survivor starts with the castaways being able to take anything and everything off the boat. Pretty straight forward

**Pre-Merge**: Pre-Merge is mostly a story of people surviving on an island. Almost all time is spent focusing on camp life, and Kelly form the first alliance in Ep4.

**Merge**: The merge at ten has 5 Pagong and 5 Tagi members left. For the first 3 votes after merge the pieces are there to get Rich out

**Final Immunity**: One of my favorite final immunity challenges ever. Stand on a log while keeping your hand on the poll. No skill

**FTC**: A surprisingly unbitter jury(excpet Sue). Seemed like it could fall either way going in. Kelly's answers seem to do little to help her cause, he was the deciding vote.

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- Gretchen and BB start fire with glasses on day 2. Something contestants still struggle with in current seasons.
- Greg invents the nature phone
- Greg builds some highly efficient rat traps
- Greg builds his ""bachelor bird nest"" that he sleeps in on the side.
- Richard Hatch walks around naked.
- Gervase makes the comment
- The first vote after the merge
- Jenna doesn't get a video from home. This was actually pretty sad.
- Colleen
- Greg's fake crying exit after being voted off.
- The first Pagonging. A tribes extinction has only happened like this two other times with the Sook Jai tribe of Thailand
- Sue's FTC speech about Snakes and Rats. Classic and still one of the best ever.

**What if/Why Moments**

- Why did everyone consider alliances unethical? Everyone eventually realizes it is the way to play the game
- What if Sean didn't vote based on alphabetical order? This really comes into play Ep9. Kelly disbands from the alliance and throws a rogue vote at Sean. Colleen, Sue, Rudy vote Jenna. Alphabetically it is Sean's turn to vote for Jenna, but he repeatedly says he will change if he senses she is in trouble. He votes for Jenna, eliminating her. Even in the voting booth he says ""Maybe you will get 1 or 2 votes but nothing major. After this vote Sean realizes his voting strategy might be dumb.
- At 7, and Rudy. This was sort of the last chance numbers wise, and things were lining up. Kelly was feeling immoral being in an alliance, and was on edge with Sue for growing closer to Pagong. Unfortunately, Sean and Gervasse still weren't 100% convinced their was an alliance going on.
- What if Kelly takes Rudy to FTC or what if Rudy wins final immunity. Personally

**Underlying Themes**

- **Greg &amp; Colleen**: It was the first hint at a romance on Survivor. The two later claimed to have played it up
- **Alliances**: The word first surfaces in Ep4 as Rich, and immoral. Kelly who is in the dominate alliance often has second thoughts and claims it makes the game no fun. Everyone eventually realizes alliances are necessary, but it is too late.
- **Who would go home next?**: In 2000 when this was live

**Interesting Season Notes**

- Castaways get a little bit more luxuries in early seasons including, and other comforts.
- Fire was rewarded in the form of water-proof matches not flint.
- The first reward challenge didn't happen until Ep3.
- The word alliance isn't mentioned until Ep4.
- Jeff doesn't throw his arms up and shout ""X wins immunity!""

**Controversial Topics**

- It has been rumored that producers pushed for Rudy to stay in the game longer,000000 it is a big deal.
- Gervase is given a floating device to help him swim in an early immunity challenge. I am not sure if this would fly nowadays. Hope he learned to swim for Blood vs Water.

**Overall Season Rating**

In my opinion this season is great, but that would still be practical today. He was an all around good player who had strong social game, smart strategy, good camp work ethic, and smooth tribal answers. He dominated his season from start to finish and was a very deserving winner. Dude should have paid his taxes though...",,False,t5_2qhu3,True

Based upon what other in the thread say, but I know someone threw out Phillip's name as well.

**Brenda** - Clearly was targeting Andrea.  And the editing showed it several times

**Dawn** - Seemed to be ok voting for Andrea

**Cochran** - ??

**Phillip** - Originally suggest Andrea to Brenda

**Erik** - Ended up voting for ~~Phillip~~ Fillup

**Andrea** - ""Phillip

**Sherri** - ??

*******************

**How was everyone's game affected by last night's TC?**

**Brenda** - It may just be wishful thinking, Andrea loses a lot of her power.

**Dawn** - Still hard to tell.  Cochran made a comment about reassessing whether she would be a good one to take to the end.  I still think she is too well liked (although I have no idea why) for anyone to want to take her to the end

**Cochran** - I don't think his game has changed at all from last night.  He continues to be able to run surprisingly under the radar

**Erik** - I don't think we can read anything into his vote for Fillup.  I think he was just sick of Phil and was ready for him to be gone. Despite that vote (and the previews for next week)

**Andrea** - Besides Phillip, she's lost a lot of her power.  Combine that with Brenda clearly targeting her - and having Dawn to go along with her - and Andrea is in trouble.  Her best long-term game plan is to try to replace Phillip in Sherri's life.

**Sherri** - She's still just a pawn with a reasonable chance to get to the end, I think she was lucky to survive last night's vote.  I *think* Malcolm's plan (or at least hope) was that SrU would turn on Sherri when they realized Eddie wouldn't be going home. She would be a fairly obvious target since she was a late addition.  Malcom was hoping SrU would move in that direction, allowing him to keep both HIIs and not play them.  Since it didn't work out that way, Sherri ""won"" in the sense that she didn't go home, but she is still unlikely to go anywhere in the game.

**Brolliance** - Last night was a hail mary that didn't score a touchdown and, but being down 6-3, their days are numbered.  To stay in the game, they need an immunity run (either challenge or HII).  If possible, Reynold and Malcolm will be the first to go.  If that happens, and Eddie is the last Bro standing, it could mean interesting things for both his game and Andrea's game.

******************

**Bold Prediction**

I think Brenda, and argue that's wrong.

This season has been edited to be all about **Stealth**-R-Us.  If Brenda is able to remain in **Stealth** mode for 28+ days and then start maneuvering things to get to the end, and her **stealth** game, makes me think she may have a much better chance that we've been lead to believe.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1cltqo/lets_talk_about_the_whispering_at_tribal_council/

We've had Exile Island, Heroes vs. Villains, Fans vs. Favorites, All-Stars, Med-Evacuated Players, Racially Divided Tribes, Battle of the Sexes

But what new ideas are left to mine?

I listened to this year-old podcast from Amazon's Rob Cesternino and Tocantins' Stephen Fishbach  in which they fielded suggestions on how to ""fix"" Survivor. You can listen here:

http://www.podfeed.net/episode/The+First+Ever+Survivor+Think+Tank+-+Stephen+Fishbach+on+How+to+Fix+Survivor/3447795

Their favorite suggestion was a recommendation based on a twist from a foreign version of Survivor: ""The Black Vote"", knowing that they have a black vote cast against them.

In all honesty

But what other suggestions would you have for doing a unique season of Survivor?

Here are my four:

1) Honestly, merge at ten, seven-person jury, final two, more survival-based challenges like the old S.O.S. challenge, etc. 

2) It's an individual game from the start

3) A season of pre-merge boots. It's hardly an original idea

4) An off-shoot of #2, they draw eggs. Whichever castaways have the red eggs are the captains, and they lead off a schoolyard pick, where each chosen person then picks the next person for their team.

The challenge goes on as expected, as you're not always going to be able to accommodate your friends. It can also force disparate figures in the game to work together. 

However

An individual game that's played in 3-day increments. On the first day, everyone meets on the beach to choose buffs again. It's a game in which tribes are constantly reshuffling, potentially throwing alliances into chaos and changing the balance of physical power in challenges, avoiding Pagonging by keeping tribes in flux.

Of course

1. Ensure safety for one tribal council because everyone thinks that I'm playing the idol.

2. Make everyone think that I definitely do not have the idol.

3. Raise suspicion of everyone else in the tribe because it seems as if someone found the idol

4. Build trust within the tribe. I could go around the next day asking everyone if they knew anything about the fake idol and then assuring them that I believed them 100% when they deny involvement. Which would be true.

- Surprise start. Contestants are tricked into starting with only the clothes on their back. More on this below.

- Looting rewards. The tribe that wins reward gets to pillage one item from the losing teams camp. 

- Outcast Tribe. The first six people voted off return to compete in an immunity challenge on day 19. By winning the challenge two Outcasts are voted back into the game by their fellow Outcast tribe members. 

**The Winner: Sandra Diaz-Twine**

- Note: In season 20 Sandra goes on to become the first and only two time winner of Survivor.

Here are some quotes to give insight into Sandra's strategy...

- ""I'm just glad it's not me...Let them duke it out...let them kill eachother off. As long as it aint Sandra I'm happy.""

- ""She'd vote out her best friend or her worst enemy. She would go to the next level with five people she hated, I'll vote for them.'""

- ""There are always bigger fish to fry...if someone needed that extra vote

Sandra is the only hispanic to ever win Survivor, can not be overlooked. Consistently buying herself three more days led to new opportunities for further progression in the game. Sandra is also one of the most underrated speakers. She can lie and create a convincing story without thinking twice, as well as deliver smart tribal council answers. Her ability to speak spanish immediately helped her tribe. This, and her tribes early dominance took away any threat of her being eliminated early due to being physically weak. Sandra forms the tightest pre-merge alliance with Christa and Rupert, and is never in danger of going home. Sandra is able to stay in the majority until Rupert's blindside at 8 left. IMO this is where Sandra truly shines and puts to rest any notion of coattail riding. 

**Characters**

- **Sandra**: A complete non-factor at challenges

- **Lil**: Eliminated third

- **Jonny Fairplay**: A masterful liar and manipulator. He did an excellent job at keeping his closest ally, but whatever it is funny! He gets in fights, has great confessionals, and actually played the game very well. Lied about his grandma dying.

- **Darrah**: Lazy around camp

- **Burton**: Thought he was the leader of Drake

- **Christa**: Tight alliance with Rupert and Sandra

- **Rupert**: One of the most well liked Survivor's ever. He took on the role as Drake's leader and preached for Drake unity. Tried to use the strategy of ""I'm the food provider

- **Savage**: The leader of Morgan and there best strategic player. Wanted to always keep the strongest members around. He really let the Outcast twist effect his game and it cost him. He also wore his suit blazer during confessionals which was pretty cool.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Surprise! The game is starting and you only get the clothes on your back. Each tribe is also given 100 Balboas (~$100) to purchase any necessary supplies at a local village. Sandra is the only person who can speak spanish and it gives Drake a huge advantage. Morgan is scattered everywhere with no plan and leave their raft unattended, fishing spear, rice, beans, fruit, 2 live chickens, booze, 2 machetes, and 2 cooking pots. This actually equates to more starting supplies than any tribe has ever received. Morgan on the other hand gets no where near as much and leaves the village before spending all of their money. Best start ever!

**Pre-Merge**: Savage, Darrah, and Tijuana control the majority at Morgan. Burton, Shawn, and Michele think they are the majority at Drake, but actually Rupert, Sandra, JF

**Merge**: The Outcasts are voted back in just before the merge, and giving Drake the power. With 8 left, JF rallies the remaining Morgan and Burton to blindside Rupert. This gives Fairplay, Burton, Lil, and Darrah control until 5 when the three remaining women take out Burton. Basically a completely unaligned, stand alone final four. It's blindside after blindside and alliances are only temporary. This is the first season that every single person is really trying hard to win the game. 

**Final Immunity**: Balance on a raft in the ocean using your hands and feet. A nice mix of focus and endurance. Sandra quickly drops out and JF immediately tries to strike a deal with Lil

**FTC**: A semi bitter jury, but she was criticized for riding coattails as well as not properly representing the boy scouts. Sandra stands by her strategy, saying she has no regrets, and that she was her own player. Lil's questions and answers continuously come back to her wearing her scout uniform and she even admits to riding coattails, being weak, and having a bunch of regrets. In Lil's final remarks she finally stands up for herself and tells the jury off for their heavy criticism. Sandra has a strong answer for every question and scoffs at the accusation of riding coattails saying ""Rupert was gone early. Who did I ride? I'm here not them.""

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- Osten tries to start the adventure with two bottles of alcohol.

- Osten suggests Nicole and Tijuana flash the local merchants for money at the fishing village.

- Morgan tribe sprints up and down beach looking for perfect camp site.

- Burton opens a coconut and only shares with Shawn and Michelle.

- Morgan tribe doesn't use their map and wanders around looking for water.

- Drake tribe modifies their clothes. Rupert makes a skirt from Christa's dress. Sandra makes shoes from leaves. Burton and Shawn continually rip on Rupert about his dress.

- Morgan men get naked at first challenge.

- First loot reward Sandra decided to take Morgan tarp. They tell her ""take it down yourself""

- Shawn loses the fishing spear head. Rupert is pissed.

- Drake finds the buried treasure

- Burton

- Fairplay goes to tribal drunk.

- Michele is supposed to act like she can't do the gross food challenge

- Rupert takes care of his pet snake Balboa until it dies. 

- A pelican strolls into the Morgan camp and Osten freaks out and wants to kill it.

- JF and Shawn get in numerous fights over Shawn's work ethic at camp.

- Osten quits on day 19. First time someone had ever quit.

- Burton and Lil are voted back in on day 19. First time contestants have ever returned after being voted out.

- Savage gets taste of his own medicine when he asks Lil

- After Rupert is voted out

- JF lies about his grandmother dying.

- Sandra eavesdrops on people's conversations from the bushes several times. She brings Tijuana with her one time to over hear JF and Burton talking final 3 plans that go against what they had promised her and Darrah.

- At word scramble immunity challenge

- Sandra hides all the water cans, knives, pick axe, spear, and goggles. 

- Burton wins reward at 5 and take JF because he would be more fun

- At the reunion JF says

**What if/Why Moments**

- Why does Trish try to get Rupert out pre-merge? It was too early. They still needed him for food and challenges. Trish was even in the majority with him. She could have done nothing and made the merge.

- Why does Rupert believe Lil is with him so easily? After he knew JF and Burton were plotting something

- What if Burton and JF stay with Darrah and Lil? They had final four in place and it would mean Sandra was gone at 5. Instead the guys want to turn on Darrah

- Why does Burton take Fairplay on reward with him at 5? The answer is Burton was sick of going on rewards with people he didn't like and thought Jon would be more fun. At this point Lil still wants Burton and her to the end

- What if Lil takes Fairplay to FTC? Lil is almost guaranteed to win. This was the biggest mistake since Colby not taking Kieth and it cost her.

I will post each season of Survivor as individual comments and people will reply to each season comment with their own personal favorite contestant from that season. If you see your favorite


Here are a few rules to keep this simple and civilized. 

* Please include the full names of contestants that you are nominating. If they have a nickname

* Your downvotes will have no affect on the outcome. I will be picking the top contestants based solely on how many upvotes they have (I have RES so I can see how many upvotes/downvotes a post receives.) **Ignore this. See EDIT 3 as to why. I'm just keeping this here so people who previously posted will know it changed**

* Only players from their original seasons can be nominated. All-Stars and HvV will not be options to nominate from and for the seasons with new and veteran players (Guatemala, South Pacific, and Philippines) only the new players can be nominated.

* If you wish to give a reason behind why your nomination should be upvoted make it a reply to the nomination post and do not include it in the nomination post itself. Example of what not to do given by /u/pshah1225: JT because he's hawt. (The comment's logic would deserve a downvote




I will wait a few days for the votes to come in and then I will get the bracket set up. 

EDIT: Please feel free to base your nominations off of the contestants games in all seasons they take part in

EDIT 2: If you see your favorite already listed

EDIT 3: It was brought to my attention by /u/Alley-0op that the upvote/downvote ratio shown in RES isn't entirely reliable

EDIT 4: You should also check out the thread organized by /u/pshah1225. It's basically the same thing we're doing here but it's for the most entertaining Survivor contestant. http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1669lk/lets_find_out_who_people_consider_to_be_the_most/

EDIT 5: I think it's time to start making the bracket. The votes seem to be trickling in and the nominations have stopped altogether. I'm officially calling the nomination period as over. Your choices will be input into a bracket and you will have the option of voting between pairs of contestants

The first ever tribe swap! On day 13 three members from each of the tribes are switched

**The Winner: Ethan Zohn**

Ethan was a very solid all around player. He was handsome, but is fine until they are reunited at the merge. Ethan doesn't have any big moves in particular that put him in the FTC, but played smart the whole 39 days. Of the three members of his alliance he was the one loyal to both. When Tom and Lex turned on each other in the end, Ethan stayed safe in the middle. Ethan also brought back a box of cookies from a reward for the tribe. This scored huge brownie points at the time.

**Characters**

- **Ethan**: Good looking and really nice. Once he got in the power alliance he was never in jeopardy.

- **Kim J**: Her game was all about staying loyal to the original Boran tribe. That and winning the final two immunity challenges got her into the FTC. 
- **Lex**: The leader of the Boran tribe. Formed the power alliance with Ethan and Tom on day 2. Did a good job forming bonds with everybody
- **Big Tom**: Everyone's favorite goat farmer. You could only understand half of what he said
- **Teresa ""T-Bird""**: So nice
- **Kim Powers**: This seasons cutie. Originally a part of the lazy young Samburu
- **Frank**: The military man who was on his own safari. Had no social game
- **Lindsey**: The leader of the lazy young Samburu tribe

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Here are all of your supplies, Samburu breaks almost all of their water gords/pots which really hinders them pre-merge.

**Pre-Merge**: Samburu is instantly split 4v4 by age and work ethic. Meanwhile Lex

**Tribe Swap**: Day 13 has the first ever tribe swap. Silas is instantly screwed being on the new Boran tribe with Frank and T-Bird. Lex, Tom, and Kelly are able to learn that Lindsey has past votes against her and when the votes are deadlocked at tribal, that becomes the difference. 

**Merge**: The merge starts with 6 original Boran members and 4 original Samburu, Ethan, and Kim J make up the dominant 4 and dictate most votes. It looks shaky at times, but they do manage to get it to a Boran final 4.

**Final Immunity**: Stand with one leg on each stump while keeping a hand on the idol. Survivor reuses this as a final immunity challenge several times. I do like this challenge as it is almost solely about focus and willpower. Kim wins and takes Ethan to FTC.

**FTC**: Definitely seems to favor Ethan going in, the swing becomes Lex who had a close relationship with both finalists. Ethan seemed to have had this wrapped up though.

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- Samburu creates fire on day 2 from a telescope lense that is included in the first aid kit. Meanwhile Boran fails to realize they have the same supplies.

- Clarence takes two cherries instead of one.

- Clarence stays at camp to take care of a dehydrated Diane while everyone else goes to the waterhole. While away Clarence opens a can of beans for him and Diane. The tribe is furious

- The first Samburu tribal is deadlocked 4v4

- The young Samburu ask the older tribe members to vote for Lindsey since she already has previous votes against her. The older members instead target Silas as a big screw you.

- Lindsey is suffering from dehydration and Linda walks up on her. Not to make fun of her pain

- Big Tom &amp; Lex remove a tick from Lindsey's ass.

- In the first immunity challenge after the tribal swap

- Clarence gives the chickens an ultimatum

- Frank tries to communicate with an elephant by swinging his arms and canteen.

- The tribal Clarence gets voted out, Lex has decided Kelly cast the vote against him and decides to send her home.

- Big Tom gets a massive boil on his neck.

- Frank &amp; Brandon win a movie dinner date reward.

- At the auction Ethan and Tom combine money to win a mystery item that is pancakes, he won't eat the ham!""

- Kim J bathes downstream from elephant poop and Tom has some funny confessionals commenting on it.

- Tom has some funky smelling feet/boots.

- At tribal Lex refers to being voted out as ""a walk of shame"". The next tribal Kelly

- Tom's FTC question of ""If a hyena walks into our camp

**What if/ Why Moments**

- What if Kim J is voted off in ep3 or ep4? She cost her team in challenges early by being older. If Boran loses an immunity she is the one on the chopping block. 
- Why does Brandon vote with Boran and send Kelly home? At 9 people left
- What if Kim J flips at 7 and goes with the remaining Samburu to eliminate Lex and his alliance? This is one of T-Bird's many strategies to try and advance herself. She had a lot of good ideas
- What if Lex doesn't win immunity at 5? Tom and Lex's relationship is starting to boil over
- What if Lex and Kim join Teresa to vote Tom off at 5? After Lex wins immunity Teresa tells Lex how Tom has floated his name around
- What if Kim takes Lex to FTC, Teresa, and Brandon. If either guy wins final immunity they both eliminate Kim. In FTC I think Ethan comes out ahead as everyone liked him, while people grew impatient of Lex at the end.

**Underlying Themes**

- **It's Africa!**: The contestants are constantly reminded of their harsh locale over the season. This season has more dehydration incidents than most with Diane

**Interesting Season Notes**

- The tribes started with partially built boma fences around their camp. This and Gabon are the only seasons that future any prebuilt structures. 
- Ep7, scissors with Clarence.
- Ep8
- Ep10 is the first sighting of Jeff saying the full ""Lex wins immunity!"". Even then it is a little half assed and still not a consistent thing by the end of the season.

**Controversial Topics**

- The final 4 immunity challenge is the tribe mate quiz challenge. Lex gives a correct answer that is ruled wrong
- The voting tiebreaker: This season sees two deadlock votes. The first happens at Samburu's first tribal. With no previous votes possible the tiebreaker becomes a survival quiz

**Overall Season Rating**

I personally have this season ranked around the middle of the 26. The location of Africa is bold and really cool, never once receiving a vote against. He put himself in a majority alliance from the beginning and successfully sticks with it. Ethan did a good job of building relationships with jury members while keeping his integrity. A solid season winner, but nothing special. I personally rank Ethan somewhere in the back half of survivor winners at 15-26.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1hbzhn/survivor_3_africa_breakdown/
1372478032.0,1haklf,Survivor 2 Australian Outback Breakdown,SurvivorNut27,39,11,13,"**New Twists**

42 day season. The only season to extend beyond the standard 39 days.

**The Winner: Tina Wesson**

Definitely no winners edit here. Not even a confessional until ep2 and almost always talking about camp life. Tina actually cost her tribe the second immunity challenge by failing to eat the gross food. Surprisingly though, but Tina convinces Colby to vote with them on the basis of ""who is most deserving"", sending Mitchell home. After the merge, her, Keith, Colby, Elisabeth

**Characters**

- **Tina**: Preached for the most deserving to stay. Formed great bonds with the Kucha members that later made up the jury.
- **Colby**: The first time we see the cowboy and certainly his best appearance. Wins the final 5 immunity challenges and 3 of the final 4 rewards. Absolutely dominant.
- **Keith**: The island chef who couldn't cook rice. He really pissed people off over rice and it cost him in the end. 
- **Elisabeth**: She was so well liked she made it to final 4 and was given a job on The View to talk to America.
- **Rodger**: Just a great guy
- **Amber**: So upbeat and optimistic it made people like her. Also an insight into Amber's Survivor strategy: get really close with whoever is the vocal leader of the tribe. This season her and Jerri are one of the tightest twosomes.
- **Jerri**: Strategized from day 1 and it made people not like her. She was rude to a lot of people and it was the cause of her early exit. I think her growth as a person/player is the greatest in Survivor over her 3 seasons.
- **Alicia**: One of the strongest females to ever compete. When Kucha lost the advantage she was quick to go. 
- **Michael Skupin**: Good leader and solid food provider from day 1. Was the leader of the dominant tribe up until his evac. Definitely deserving of a second chance.

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Grab whatever supplies you want from a crate

**Pre-Merge**: Ogakor is splintered by Jerri and everyone is competing over Colby's vote. Meanwhile

**Merge**: In a 5v5 merge, Kucha quicly loses control of the game at the merge. Voting generally follows the pattern of ""who is most deserving"" with Colby, Tina, and Keith dictating things.

**Final Immunity**: A quiz about your tribe mates. Wow. The worst final immunity challenge ever. Wrong place for this kind of challenge.

**FTC**: Up for grabs going in. Totally unbitter jury. Tina really stresses that she came in with a strategy and executed it. Colby meanwhile gives lackluster answers, while Tina attempted a last stitch attempt at connecting on a personal level. Not saying any of this changed any votes, but at this point in the game everything is important. It is a little surprising Rodger votes Colby, while Jerri and Alicia vote Tina. Somewhere in there is the deciding vote.

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- 2nd challenge Rodger has to jump off of a cliff and he can't really swim.
- Jerri accuses Kel of having a secret stash of beef jerky. Her, especially when HII come into play.
- Jerri calls Keith out for not being able to cook the rice properly.
- Ep3 Mike begins his quest to hunt a pig. Everyone's confessional mocks him about having no chance. Ep4 Mike runs down a baby pig and stabs it to death.
- Ep4 has the first voting deadlock in Survivor history. The tiebreak is revealed to be previous votes against
- Kimmy &amp; Alicia get into a fight over when to kill the chickens resulting in the infamous Alicia finger wag.
- Kimmy apparently doesn't bathe because she thinks the river is dirty. Skupin has a few hilarious confessionals commenting on her hygiene.
- Kucha tribe discovers the chicken feed is secretly delicious and constantly makes it as a snack.
- Skupin falls into the fire on day 17
- After poor food rationing the Barramundi tribe is forced to trade Jeff all of their tarps in exchange for more rice and fishing hooks.
- Rain floods the camp washing everything away

**What if/Why Moments**

- What if Tina is voted out on Day 6 for costing her tribe immunity? It is not unreasonable to think of
- What if Skupin doesn't fall in the fire? He for sure make the merge
- What if Colby takes Keith to FTC instead of Tina? Consensus seems to be that Colby wins. This just wasn't Colby's style though. He didn't feel Keith deserved it and was legitimately happy when Tina won.

**Underlying Themes**


- **The wildfire**: A wildfire was raging across the Outback just miles from the pre-merge camps. It didn't play much of a role
- **Colby &amp; Jerri**: Jerri was in love with Colby, and Cirie, use their past relationships to their advantage. These two instead make it a priority to eliminate each other. You could also argue that Jerri gets better in every one of her seasons, while Colby slowly deteriorates.
- **Who is the most deserving?**: Colby saved Keith early on because he felt he deserved to stay. Jerri

**Interesting Season Notes**

- Castaways are given their personal items right away again. Colby brings a huge Texan flag for instant shelter.
- Ep3 Immunity challenge is the first time upon winning a challenge Jeff shouts
- Ep6 has the first blindfold challenge in Survivor history. These are always great.
- Ep7 is the first time we see the individual challenge of ""stand on this poll in the water"". This is the challenge that gets Jenna and Heidi naked in the Amazon. Keith wins this challenge.
- Ep10 has the first Survivor auction

**Controversial Topics**

- The voting deadlock tiebreaker being past votes against. Such a bad way to break a deadlock

- Colby took some coral from the Great Barrier Reef while on a reward. During the same reward the helicopter pilot flew over protected bird rookeries.

**Overall Season Rating**

- Men vs Women! The two tribes are divided by gender to start the game. Playing into this

**The Winner: Jenna Morasca**

The youngest person to ever play and to ever win at the time. A swimsuit model in a season of battle of the sexes and she knew how to use it. She often came across as spoiled and vain, Heidi, and Rob, but that was short lived. From the final 6 on Jenna is in danger and had to win the final two immunity challenges to make FTC. She was the last women standing and played a loyal game through out which helped her in the end. 

**Characters**

- **Jenna**: A lindslide win at FTC and a surprisingly strong challenge competitor. Used her sexuality like crazy.

- **Matthew**: This guy loved his machete. He really excelled at the survival aspects of the game

- **Rob Cesternino**: Witty one liners, but it also cost him in the end. 

- **Butch**: The principal who brought the ""Believe in yourself"" banner. He was obsessed with collecting and storing firewood. He was loyal

- **Heidi**: Intelligent, and had a tight alliance with Jenna.

- **Christy**: The first handicapped person to ever compete on Survivor. Being deaf put her at a communication disadvantage which led to her not fitting in well with the women originally

- **Deena**: The only non-beautiful to have anything going on strategically this season. A bit bossy and was elected leader of the original Jaburu. She got caught conspiring to take out the Beautiful Alliance and was taken out. 

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Tribes are divided by sex and given boats to paddle to camp. At camp awaits 5 big water jugs already filled with fresh water, kerosine, manioc flour, and personal machetes for everyone. A very uninteresting start besides the gender divide. 

**Pre-Merge**: The women of Jaburu are a mess from the beginning. Sleeping on the ground the first night, Jenna, Heidi, and Shawna the majority. The only saving grace of Jaburu is that they actually won challenges, which is actually worth a lot since they were facing a tribe of all guys. The Tambaqui men on the other hand have a great camp life going on, but keep losing challenges to the women. 

**Tribe Swap**: The long awaited gender interactions. It starts off even with three men and three women on each. On Tambaqui

**Merge**: The men go into the merge up 6v4. Roger, but Alex, Rob, and Matt have aligned with the Jaburu women and get rid of the sexist Roger. Prior to this Survivor was all about getting to the merge with numbers and staying loyal until it is just your tribe left. The Beautiful Alliance of Alex, Jenna, Heidi, and Rob dictate the next couple of votes until Rob flips again and takes out Alex, with the voting help of Matt and Butch

**Final Immunity**: Hold a tribal headpiece above your head

**FTC**: Jenna says she played morally

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- At the very beginning

- The first night both teams just talk shit about the other tribe.

- Rob's magic 8 ball. So many questions about hooking up with the women.

- The guys are so cocky and lose the first challenge becuase of a balancing beam. Is a balancing beam the big gender equalizer?

- Joanna freaks out over the immunity idol and doesn't want it in camp because it goes against her beliefs.

- Joanna confronts Christy and puts her hand in her face.

- Women's tribe fins a partially eaten energy bar. Jeanne puts the blame on Janet.

- Matt and Daniel speak mandarin chinese to each other.

- Matching items challenge is the first tribe interaction and the flirting is on.

- ""I didn't know Jesus had a vested interest in Survivor...Every picture I have seen Jesus is a guy

- Shawna breaks down and wants to quit

- Alex hits himself in the forehead with a machete.

- The disgusting challenge of ripping meat off the pig with no hands and spitting it out.

- Heidi and Jenna get naked for peanut butter

- Matt constantly sharpens his machete. Everyone thinks he is going to kill them.

- Butch gets bit on his finger by a ""dead"" piranha.

- Heidi gets bit on the knee by a spider. Huge swelling and she can't walk for a couple days.

- Christy pays $340 at the auction for her letter from home after not buying anything else and never going on a  reward. Jenna then starts to cry that she was outbid so Jeff puts the letters back up for bid and Jenna gets her for $120. I thought this was ridiculously unfair to Christy and a bitch move on Probst's part for caving into Jenna's tears. Back at camp

- Jenna and Heidi don't help with building a new shelter because they are the next to go.

- Everyone gets drunk after the loved ones reward. Butch possibly soiled himself in the shelter?

- Jenna gives up her immunity necklace to Heidi at 6 left. This is the first time anyone ever gave up immunity.

- Butch's obsession with collecting firewood leads to the Jacare camp burning down.


**What if/Why Moments**

- What if the older women and Christy take out Shawna, and that it would get even worse when the guys became involved. Something like this was the only way a non-beautiful person was winning this season.

- Why does Christy waiver at 6? She just has to agree to vote out Heidi

- What if Jenna doesn't win immunity at final four? She goes home that night leaving an all male final 3. All the sudden Matt is on great terms with both guys. A Matt and Rob final might be the most likely outcome here. Same thing at final three.

- Why does everyone love Jenna so much? She was lazy and whiny

**Underlying Themes**

- **Men vs Women**: Could a group of women possibly survive in a rain forest and compete with a group of men? This cast and the gender separation also led to a lot of sexual tension.

- **Jenna and Heidi**: They formed the tightest alliance of the season and one of the strongest women duo's of all time. They were both ridiculously good looking too and used it to their advantage. 

**Interesting Season Notes**

- This is the first season to give the castaways flint as a fire source.

- This is the first of three seasons to divide the castaways into two tribes of men vs women. (Vanuatu and One World)

**Controversial Topics**

- There was speculation that Christy did not understand that at FTC you vote for who you want to win

**Overall Season Rating**

**-Go back to Final Two**

I'm more on the side of keeping it at Final 3. Someone mentioned winning the last immunity challenge gives you too much power as you're already going to FTC. On the flip side

**-Equal editing(no brainer)**

**-Reward Challenges and Immunity Challenges. Both are separate challenge.**

While I agree that Reward/Immunity should be separate challenges

**-Three tribes at the beginning of the game**

As of late

**-Director's cut online for each episode**

I'm in full support of this. There is always the casual/hardcore fanbase. Casual's don't care enough for to want to view more while hardcore fans may want to see more footage and strategy. 

**-16 or 18 player seasons**

I'm more on the 18 player side. I support 18 do to medical evacs/players who quit the game. Shit happens and if it happens when there is starting total of 16 players

**-New locations**

Obvious in full support of this. My favorite seasons besides HvV was Gabon and China because of their location. 

**-""Survivor: Classic""**

Don't have much to chime in on this one. More info

**-Exile Island**

Don't have much to say here since I haven't seen a lot of seasons with Exile Island. What I would like to note is that it cuts into the ""Equal editing"" and challenges time. Could be included within the Director's cut.

**-All new players**

**-Redditors are divided on returning players.** 

See below

**-[Rotation for the types of seasons.](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ej5tn/what_exactly_do_people_want_with_a_new_season_of/ca0rp2b)** 

I see no other reason if Survivor were to continue for years to come to do it in this format. Seasons with 2-3 returning players are real boring/unfair. They know to play the game(and sometimes well). Should be included in a(n) All Stars/FvF/HvH. Seasons that had 2-3 returning players, Philippians) had a player in the FTC.(Unless I missed some other seasons that included this format)

The people who are brought back is another debate.

**-""only 1 challenge advantage

Agreed. Most players who get an advantage, before the last challenge. No actual advantage.

**-No Hidden Immunity Idols or make them harder to find.** 

I say keep the HII but make the harder to find. I loved seeing players fight over a clue or trying to sneak it away so no one sees. Maybe one HII where it's easy to find.

**-[Different ways to select tribes](http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1ej5tn/what_exactly_do_people_want_with_a_new_season_of/ca0v6sx)**

1355864146.0,152j69,Jury Analysis Survivor: Samoa,Airmo,33,5,21,"After plenty of discussions surrounding Russell Hantz, but also in control of how they go home. After reading the Funny115 post concerning Russell’s fall in Samoa and giving the season a re-watch, Lisa’s dominance took the game away from her. Jury members constantly turn to their own games as a point of reference to decide the winner. Players that recognize this thrive in tribal council; Skupin’s answer for Carter reflects this beautifully. Essentially

Erik- In the First 27 days recap, Erik was able to make decisions while staying in a position not threatened by anyone’s desire to usurp command. I hope the similarities to Natalie’s game are clear in this assessment. They both dive under an egotistical leader in order to get farther. Thus, Erik’s speech follows an analysis of the finalists’ game play. He asserts that Russell Hantz proudly lied, cheated, and stole his way to the end while Natalie flew under the radar. “But why is Natalie’s game any less valuable than Russell’s?” Erik asks us. In Erik’s mind, Natalie’s game (and his own) is the Holy Bible of Survivor strategy. Thus, Natalie wins his vote for successfully pulling it off. Sorry Russell

Kelly- She outright asserts that she is tougher than Natalie. Kelly claims to have never seen Natalie prove herself in the challenges as she had. As a side note, she re-draws the comparison to Kelly. Natalie recalls the rough conditions they both survived and thrived in. Kelly then asks Russell what he values most outside the game; she claims it’s difficult to look past the crude values he demonstrated on the island. Unfortunately, Russell does not turn to examples as Natalie does. By contrast, he simply states that he values “honour, integrity, and loyalty” to his family is most important to him. Actions speak louder than words, Russell; state you want to win this for your family and you may have stood a chance. Demonstrate how these qualities are reflected in your actions

Laura- Kelly and Monica flocked toward Laura. She was the mother hen of their tribe. After the merge, many similarities to Russell. So, why doesn’t she vote for Russell? Let’s turn to her jury question to highlight the answer. After all, jury members typically have their minds set before tribal council, so their questions reveal more about themselves than they do about the finalists. Laura asks Russell what he learned about her that enabled him to beat her. Russell’s answer doesn’t matter because Laura is trying to trap Russell; like Kelly, Laura doesn’t think she was beat by anybody. John’s flip in the re-vote sends her home; in her mind, it was the weakness of another player that sent her home. Thus, after speaking to Erik at Ponderosa

John- Most people praise John for his ability to objectively view the game avoiding “bitterness.” However, Russell asserts his “control” in the game; he made the plans and executed them. Russell always wanted to avoid putting the fate of his game in someone else’s hands. John’s not going to vote for Natalie or Mick; they put their games in the hands of Russell and rode him to the end. Thus, Russell validates John’s view of the game and validates his flip against Galu to avoid the rocks. We can’t say John simply isn’t bitter and that’s why he voted for Russell; Russell’s FTC speech is tapered to the interest John held in the game. Russell goes through the thought process of his strategy and proves to execute what John only attempted. 

Dave- Watching throughout the season, he allowed others to make his decisions. Dave was in it for the group; if his group made it to the end, he honestly believed he was the “best” in the group and would win on that alone. Unfortunately, his jury question is less than revealing. As a reminder, he asks what the finalists think their chances are. Thus, based on the evidence available, I’m leaning to believe Dave continued to follow the group voting for Natalie. I could also suggest that perhaps Dave thought his game was reflected in Natalie; she constantly refers to the Foa Foa alliance as a group or as “we.” She explains the decisions were made as a group and suggests that she was able to thrive in the wilderness (similar to Dave). By contrast, alienating the values Dave held in the game. 

Monica- Returning to Funny115, so I’m inclined to fall back on this moment as an exception to my Jury analysis. It’s pretty clear that when she said that to Russell, she meant it; she would never vote for Russell after he voted her out. Although it’s also possible that Monica viewed her game as one that would not stir the pot until her back was against the wall. Russell constantly stirs stuff up regardless; he makes absurd promises to everyone portraying an erratic game. Natalie didn’t make a move until her back was absolutely against the wall and she was forced to stir the pot against Erik at the merge. She then just let Galu fall apart on its own thanks to the power struggles exposed by the boot. Maybe Monica saw this and that’s why she voted for Natalie instead of Mick, but it was always clear she would not vote for Russell. 

 Shambo- Throughout the post merge, and Russell managed to beat her in the end. Thus, Shambo describes Natalie using the dirtiest “c-word” she knows: “coattail rider.” Natalie suggests the decisions were mutually arrived at among the Foa Foa, but Shambo believes it was all her and Russell. Russell gets her vote because they share the strategy of in-your-face backstabbing. 

Jaison- To vote for Russell would be to highlight a flaw in his game. With Brett winning so many immunities, Jaison knows he has to go with Russell to the final 3 unless he tries to blindside him at final 5. Wheels turning, Jaison is probably trying to think of what he is going to say to the jury with Russell sitting next to him. But he gets voted out and, in his final confessional, explains that he is only upset because Russell never told him he was going home. Had Russell explained anything to Jaison, whether he say Jaison was a threat or too weak to beat Brett, Jaison would be in the same boat as Shambo. In order to justify his game, he has to vote for Mick or Natalie. The other part of Jaison’s game was to overcome his stereotypes and remain strong; he goes through this thought constantly. It is particularly evident in the First 27 Days episode when we re-view his clash with Ben in terms of living up to the strong image set by his father. Jaison wanted to overcome stereotypes surrounding him by winning the game. Jaison also states earlier in the season that he was very “proud” of Natalie for overcoming the stereotypes surrounding her as a blonde. After she kills a rat

Brett- Coming back to camp with Mick and Natalie after losing a reward challenge, to enjoy the adventure and survive the wilderness. He doesn’t care for assertive strategy, but rather he would prefer to glide by on his own merits. Thus, Russell is out of the equation for Brett. Despite flattering Brett as an excellent young man perfect for his daughters, there is no way Russell will get his vote. Russell was there for the game; Brett was there for the adventure. Natalie and Mick have already bonded with Brett on their picnic, so Russell’s attempts (though admirable considering it is Russell) are too little too late. Thus, Brett awkwardly asks Mick in FTC what they would do on a “bro-date.” Mick doesn’t take this question seriously and instead dances around it before providing a very flat answer that they would “watch sports and enjoy some beers.” He essentially hands Natalie Brett’s vote. 

This came out extremely long and drawn out, he destroys his kingdom handing over to the last (wo)man standing.

Just as in politics, blocs will form in tribes, who have a common goal, avoiding tribal council, rather than post-merge in a individual game. This much I guess we can all agree on. Yeah, sure, people who feel the least included in blocs will always have reason to switch

When **two tribes** merge, perhaps strategically using one or two of the Smaller tribe to pull a move within Bigger tribe, but not before there is some security that Smaller tribe does not get to call the shots. The politics immediately after the merge resemble the American bipartisan political system. Whoever has majority in the house calls the shots. Might work for a country, but if you were to make a TV show out of it... boring!

So what is the difference with a **3 tribe system**? Now post-merge, or perhaps Big Tribe, Big Tribe (iow, equal members), Small Tribe or something of this nature. Now, more like the situation arising a few years ago in the UK, there is a ""hung parliament"", something which is impossible within 2 tribe games. Medium Tribe can convince Small Tribe to join them to eliminate their biggest threat, ""Can these deals with strangers be taken seriously?"" and you have yourself a hectic post-merge political game. Amirite?

**In both All-stars and Philippines, these divided players can perhaps pull other divided players later like Malcolm did with Denise in Philippines, but it lacks that merge mega-scramble.

So this is the way I would do it. Get three tribes of 8 (debatable, not people eating steaks and sliding down waterfalls) so that there is more time for editing tribal councils. Merge can happen by 7th episode, meaning the smallest possible tribe would have two members left, which could still have lots of swaying power in the game. 

Any more tribes than 3 and the editing becomes too much of a problem. 4 instances of people trying to makes 4 different fires

1365787804.0,1c7usq,(SPOILERS) Combining Wednesday Nights episode with the Evicted Castaways Interviews,,32,4,26,"In my office I stumbled upon other survivor fans and we started doing email chains after each episode. After each episode I search out the exit interviews and try to piece together the parts we saw with the parst unaired. I worked hard on my analysis so I thought I would share it with the Survivor fans of Reddit. Let me know what you guys think.

Poor Michael. He really had no clue that he was going home that night. I’ve been reading his interviews and watching the secret scenes on cbs.com to gain more insight into what actually happened between Brenda’s win and tribal council. To make a long story short

So Michael is the only Fan left from New Bikal (purple tribe) and this really should be a huge advantage for him relative to the 3 fans on New Gota...so why didn’t it pan out? According to Michael’s interviews, Cochran and Phillip, with fairly open communication about possibly using Michael further in the game. We never saw anything like that during the show. Before Andrea flipped out and started changing the vote 10 min before tribal, Dawn (he specifically calls her out) approached Michael, told him he was safe, and directed him to lay back until he is needed later in the game. 

We thought he had a great relationship with Sherri before the flip, Sherri disowned Michael. On an emotional level, I understand why Sherri did this, but on a game level...you should never vote ANYONE off who will give you information and secrets. Even if they’re not technically in your alliance, they are an asset to your game. Andrea gets it, and I suspect that’s why Eddie wasn’t targeted.

I also found out that an important swing vote had it out for Michael. Take a guess who. It’s totally unexpected. No, Corinne was targeting Brenda before the tribal swap. Even though Corinne left, Brenda still had a vendetta specifically against Michael and was not willing to work with anyone associated with Corinne (Malcolm, Reynold, Eddie and Michael). Fair enough.

So then Dawn plays Malcolm, this one wasn’t her fault. And I feel bad for her because she will be outed as a snake because her target (Malcolm) is still in the game. Andrea screwed Dawn hard with this move. And that is why, I suspect, Dawn is crying in next week’s previews. When Dawn played Francesca, Julia and Corinne, they left that night and Dawn was able to hide her dirty deeds, but because Andrea kept Malcolm in the game

This episode really opened up my eyes to the reality of Survivor. As good of a game Michael was playing, Eddie and Dawn. Neither of them knew what they were doing but it’s the hard truth. It’s just hard, and a little unsatisfying, to watch someone leave the game without a major flaw or mistake or faux pas (foo-paa a la Phillip) to explain it, especially this late in the game.

With that said, but because Dawn reassured him he was safe (and she thought he was at the time) he declines the offer and presses Reynold to play it for himself or Malcolm. I can’t believe how giving and antagonistic Reynold is at the same time. He tries to bully Dawn and Cochran into his alliance, but is willing to share his idol with anyone aligned to him. And Michael actually states, after Corinne left, Reynold was his best friend out there. I was flabbergasted. It’s just cool to see two young bucks, alpha males like Eddie and Reynold, genuinely appreciate Michael

I also remember

I was off about the Brenda stuff a little bit. Brenda targeted Corinne and Michael told Corinne.

1373682536.0,1i72vz,Survivor 8 All-Stars Breakdown,SurvivorNut27,35,11,25,"**New Twists**

- All-Stars. For the first time ever contestants from previous seasons return to play the game.

- 3 Tribes. For the first time ever there are more than two tribes to start the game.

- Others include 18 contestants instead of the normal 16

**The Winner: Amber Brkich (Mariano)**

Amber ""took it day by day"" and ""never lost her focus"". Her and Boston Rob teamed up on day 1 to form the most dominant pair Survivor had seen to date. Not since the clueless cast of Borneo had the power of the game been so secure for so long. Rob's leadership and Godfather ways gain control early and Amber is all too happy to smile and flirt her way further in the game with him. What begins as flirting soon turns into full island love, the romantic pair of Rob and Amber team up with the other strong pair, Rupert and Jenna, and along with Big Tom pretty much coast to final 5. Amber does get separated from her alliance during the second tribe swap leading to an infamous decision by Lex to keep Amber around to please Rob. Romber lie and backstab their way to their fantasy FTC of facing each other and Amber squeaks out a 4-3 victory by seemingly lying slightly less...

**Characters** It's All-Stars so everyone is an amazing character

- **Amber**: She let her partner in crime take the majority of the blame, under the radar game was the right way to go. 

- **Boston Rob Mariano**: Played one of the single most dominant games Survivor had/has seen, but he showed here that he could do it with the best of them.

- **Jenna L**: Her and Rupert formed a tight pair from the original Saboga and saw it through to final four. She never stopped talking

- **Rupert**: Rupert becomes the first contestant to play back-to-back seasons, no more no less. I think this season was his if he was just willing to backstab Rob and Amber for it. 

- **Big Tom**: Romber's +1 from the beginning. His laid back, gets caught scheming, and goes home.

- **Shii-Ann**: The she devil is back

- **Alicia**: As physically fit and full of attitude as ever. She believed she had final four with Rob, but was really on the bottom of the alliance. Voted least deserving to be an all-star by her tribemates during a challenge.

- **Kathy**: She improved her social game drastically since Marquesas which kept her out of danger early. After Sandra, while not being isolated as the odd one out. 

- **Lex**: Played a strong pre-merge game until one bad decision cost him. Lex decided to vote off his ally Jerri in order to keep Amber around

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: The All-Stars are divided into three tribes of six. There only starting supplies are 1 water pot

**Pre-Merge**: No fire for anyone for the first four days which was pretty brutal. Boston Rob unifies Chapera from the beginning and has majority with Amber, Tina and Ethan. The divide leads to poor challenge performance and having to vote out the first two people of the game. At Mogo Mogo everyone seems to get along, and them winning challenges led to not having to vote anyone out. 

**Post Saboga**: After Saboga loses the reward challenge on day 13, Lex was in control with the support of Kathy and Shii-Ann. Chapera dominates and is so happy that no one even questions where they stand in Amber and Rob's plans.

**Tribe Swap**: A tribe swap just before the merge had the tribes stay the same, while Mogo Mogo struggled to have enough food. After the new Chapera loses the immunity challenge Rob says to Lex, ""You take care of her, I'll take care of you"". Lex and Kathy ultimately decide to spare Amber and vote off their ally Jerri.

**Merge**: Wth Amber and Rob reunited they immediately break their word with Lex and Kathy in order to reform Chapera. Lex and Kathy are furious with the decision

**Final Immunity**: Same as Africa and Marquesas. Stand with one leg on each stump while keeping a hand on the idol. Jenna drops out first

**FTC**: One of the most bitter juries of any season. Rob admits his mistakes, saying her surviving being isolated from her alliance was her big move, and that she stayed focused and took the game day by day. In the end Rob has to continually face the repercussions of his betrayals and can't ever really get past that, allowing Amber to look like the cleaner one of the two and the one whose lies were not as bad. Shii-Ann delivers the only impartial vote of the night and swings things for Amber, who she had predicted to win the night she was voted off.

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- Sue and Rudy drink the contaminated water without boiling it.

- Hatch gets naked for everything again.

- Hatch catches the first shark in Survivor history. He bit a shark that bit him and smashed its head on a rock. 

- The 'build a shelter' challenge basically sums up the pre-merge. At Chapera

- Jenna Morasca quits on day 9 to return home to her dying mother.

- At the blindfold immunity challenge Boston Rob is completely stumped by the cube puzzle. Truly one of the best ever at puzzles

- Big Tom gets laid out during the blindfold challenge. This is what makes these challenges great.

- For the 'build a raft' challenge

- Hatch nakedly rubs himself on Sue during a challenge. It affects Sue over the next couple of days leading to her quit on day 17. She goes off on Probst saying she was, dehumanized and totally spent.""

- Rich gets ""bamboozled"" by Colby

- Rupert is so protective of the fishing spear

- Colby tells Shii-Ann he doesn't respect her game.

- Jerri is the worst offender of talking about food

- Big Tom does the Sue's gone dance.

- While golfing off the back of a yacht during reward

- Lex flips on Cloby/Ethan and knocks out Colby. Jerri gets her Outback revenge.

- Jerri says at tribal that she is an upbeat

- Lex tells Ethan he is going home, ""...I am going to do whatever it takes to get me further in the game. If that means exploiting situations where I have a friend that might trust me, I'll do it. It's business this time.""

- After receiving a jar of paint with no instructions

- Lex votes off Jerri over Amber because Rob said to him

- Rob trades his video from home so everyone can get their letters from home. Smart move strategically

- With 8 left

- Rupert so obviously lays out the alliances during the pecking order reward challenge as he assigns who gets what meal.

- Shii-Ann gets obnoxious with being assigned rice.

- Shii-Ann wins immunity and overtly celebrates which annoys Alicia.

- Alicia's exit interview on Rob

- Rupert only cleans and cooks one fish for himself. Jenna bitches about it.

- Rob and his brother party with Tom and his son.

- Rupert takes Big Tom's son out fishing and he loses the spear tip.

- Rob, and Jenna all run out of matches at the fire making immunity challenge.

- Can anyone understand what Big Tom is saying?

- Rupert and Jenna conspiring against Rob in the woods and Rob walks up on them.

- Rob instigates a fight between Tom and Rupert so they won't think to team up against him.

- At FTC Alicia tells Rob and Amber

- At FTC Shii-Ann tells the jury ""people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones""

- At FTC Tom goes to shake Rob's hand then pulls his hand away and says

- Jerri booed off stage at the reunion.

**What if/Why Moments**

- Why doesn't anyone try to use Ethan? Is it solely because he was a winner? I understand the threat on the original Saboga, and Shi-Ann should have added Ethan as their fourth. Loyalty and trust are so important in Survivor, why would you not use your real world friend?

- Why does no one break up Rob and Amber? Rob goes into a daze when they are separated, Jenna, and Rupert all needed to step up at some point. At least Kathy and Shi-Ann tried. At 6 left it should be Shii-Ann, Tom, Rupert, Jenna vs Romber. At 5 it should be Tom, Rupert, but no one was willing to take it. I blame Rupert.

- What if Jenna wins final immunity? Who does she take? Does she have an easy win now that everyone has an alternate choice to Romber?

**Underlying Themes**

- **Romber**: The alliance was formed on day 1 and the romance set in shortly after. The couple dominated the game like few have ever done. The first island romance led to a live proposal at the reunion. 

- **2nd play through**: It's interesting to see how people changed from their first season to All-Stars. Some people like Tina, came back with a revamped strategic game, while Kathy fixed her weakness that was the social game.

**Controversial Topics**

- Unclear Tiebreaker Rules. The contestants are still under the impression that a deadlocked final four would result in the purple rock tiebreaker. This directly influences Jenna Lewis's decision to flip on Rupert and side with Romber. I feel like the rules of the game should have been made clear to the contestants

- Rupert wins $1, and a bit extreme. To award the same prize based on America's vote as you get for actually winning the game was a bit odd. 

**Overall Season Rating**

All-Stars is the first season to ever use returning players and it shows how cutthroat the game of Survivor can get. Previous friendships outside of the game play a role for the first time ever, the smartest thing a pretty girl can do is follow in line. Amber did this and was able to use Rob as a shield for moves that she also played a role in. While winning an All-Star season is notable, her lack of strategic moves is obvious which is why I place Amber towards the bottom of my Survivor winners rankings.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1i72vz/survivor_8_allstars_breakdown/

1363276102.0,1aafih,So I was busy in Excel last night... (Spoilers),Burkett,26,2,21,"I simulated the tribal swap that the preview alluded to.

**Assumptions:**

* It is a pure 7-7 tribe swap and the contestants are distributed randomly
* Sherri
* Eddie and Reynold are defined as ""Fans - Defectors"" and are willing to jump ship.
* Philip, Dawn, Cochran, Andrea are defined as ""Favourites - Core"" and will stay loyal to one another after the swap.
* Erik and Brenda and Defined as ""Favourites - Defectors"" and are willing to jump ship.

**Method:**

* 1000 simulations in Excel (because I am not great with combinatorics) 

**Findings:**

* Based on *old* tribal lines there is 17.8% chances that the original Favourites are in the majority of both tribes and an 82.2% chance that they are in the majority of one tribe. By default this statistic also implies that there is an 82.2% chance that the Fans are in the majority of one tribe and a 0% chance that they are in the majority for both tribes.
* On both simulated tribes I found the absolute value difference between the Core Fans and Core Favourites placed on that tribe. I then totalled the number of defectors (from both Fans and Favourites) to determine if there were enough defectors to change who had the majority. In other words I tried to see if power was ""up for grabs"".  45% of the time the power was up for grabs on both tribes
* I ran a simulation looking at what if all defectors defected no matter what and since there are two defectors from each original tribe they usually canceled out and the majority statistics followed a similar breakdown to the first bullet in this section. 
* The odd of all four defectors (Erik

**Conclusion:**

I think we are in for a very interesting tribal swap because there is only a 13% chance that we see a swap where the people in the minority don't really have a chance and get picked off (a la Amber if Rob/Lex didn't intervene). I am well aware that I am making some generous/rudimentary assumptions and that anything can happen in Survivor.

1363234820.0,1a9kz6,The Best Survivor Strategy - An Economics Major Perspective,SurvivorTheories,34,10,20,"I've been thinking since hearing Jeff Probst's podcast with Chuck Klosterman. Klosterman made a good point about the fact that

In order to be in a position to win the game

However, a winning contestant should be the optimal choice to go home (Ideally this would be at the very last moment, when they are in a final 2 or 3). The only way a player who had put themselves in a position to win could survive such a vote is either.

1. Avoiding this until the very end

2. Win an immunity challenge

3. Utilize a hidden immunity idol

4. Persuade others to make the sub-optimal decision

However

Many players come into survivor either:

A - making decisions based on things other than a simple question: ""What is the best decision for me to make in order to increase my chances at winning the game?"" 

Example: Any talks of honor/loyalty/integrity for reasons other than jury management. 

or

B – More players than not simply are not intelligent enough

Example: Early seasons

Based on this

Voting

First: Early rounds - vote out weak challenge players to avoid immunity. Therefore

Second: Pre-Merge - Vote out disloyal strategists who might flip. Therefore

Early Merge: Vote out smart players from smaller alliance. Therefore

Rest of Game: Vote out Jury Threats. Therefore, and have played a worse game up until this point than all, but two players.

This is the Nash equilibrium of an ideal player in a sense. Obviously

So basically

Strategy A. They keep themselves in a place within the game up until the end where they follow this Nash equilibrium. (This can be both intentional and accidental/luck)
Or
Strategy B. They manipulate players (or play with those who are playing sub-optimal decision making strategies) in order to not be voted out when they should. 
Or
Strategy C. They win immunity (or play an idol) at a time in which they were the optimal choice

I would say, their game is flawed, because they SHOULD go home. It takes someone else making a bad choice, or an immunity challenge you are lucky to be the best at, in order for you to win.

So with that being said

In many ways

Sandra: The best type of player one can be. Will never be targeted due to her rough personality and poor challenge ability. Has awareness to point out optimal decisions to those who might not see them.

Sophie: Similar to Sandra with rough personality and poor challenge skills

Denise: Played strategy A to perfection. Only mistake is that she acknowledges she would have taken Malcolm to the end

Cirie: Always is a master of knowing where she stands in a tribe and making sure she is not on the chopping block. Great game awareness. Put herself in the perfect position for fans vs. favorites

I'd be curious to know what people think.

1360460516.0,18831h,How would you change the game to make it better?,galanix,33,10,99,"Obviously I know what people find ""better"" will be largely subjective

* **No Ponderosa.** Separate the jury members so they aren't able to talk to one another and influence one another after being voted out. All the information they get should come from when they played and tribal councils. I think it would make for more interesting jury votes and final tribals.
* **No handwritten votes.** Have people select a parchment with a person's name typed on it already or something similar. It's a small change
* **Less sit-out challenges.** One thing I hate is when a team with a numbers advantage is able to sit out their weakest players during *every* immunity challenge. Sometimes we have weak physical players who get away with never having to participate in challenges out of sheer luck (e.g. Abi-Maria). They should have more weakest-link type challenges where everyone has to participate and numbers don't matter. An example of this is an obstacle course a whole team has to run. Or a challenge where people go head-to-head and the smaller team can have people participate twice (they've done this during eating challenges).
* **Bigger money difference between first and second.** Obviously I know from a production standpoint it may not be feasible to offer more money. But at the very least I think they should make the disparity between first and second higher
* **Less food.** Maybe this is just my false perception, people tend to get much crazier when they are starving.

Malcolm knew that three possibilites were going to happen. 1) SRU votes all on him and calls his bluff about having the immunity idol;Malcolm goes home. 2)SRU splits the votes but Erik and Sherri flip to Andrea; Andrea goes home. 3) the situation we saw play out in tribal. Out of these three situations Malcolm was going home in 2 of them. That's too big of chance to leave in other players hands. 

Now here is how he could have saved himself. He should have voted for Reynold. If SRU split the votes like they did Reynold would go home and Malcolm would have 3 more days to find and idol and have taken out a big challenge competitor. If Erik and Sherri had flipped like he thought they would then Andrea would have gone home. I know some would say this would be jury suicide by taking out his alliance member but I don't think that is true

What are your thoughts about this hypothetical situation?


TL;DR Malcolm could have stayed in the game by voting for Reynold

So do we think this is some sort of strategy on her part?  Or is she just lost and doesn't really know what to do

Here's my theory:  Being too much in control the first time cost her, so there hasn't been any need to do anything.  I think (perhaps ""hope"" is more like it) that she is ready to start playing the game as soon as she needs to, but she just hasn't needed to yet.

The danger is that the time that she needs to start playing is quickly approaching, Dawn &amp; Andrea really *are* a strong alliance for the final 4, then she's got to make a move before they get down to 7.  Or, of course, be able to split that strong alliance.

She may also have some pre-show alliance that has never been discussed because it hasn't been necessary.  I don't follow the twitters and whatnot of anyone but Parvati

-Has returning players (more than any season since 20)
-Has players who have quit the game
-Has its fair share of stupid players

All of which were common criticisms of the last four seasons.

However, while flawed gameplay has been the product of interesting personalities and a ""fortunate"" turn of events that let the editors tell the story as we would like it known (the unpopular players have mostly been voted out by this point, and all the flips have taken place to let this happen).

However, while Jeff's insistence on eliminating Penner also killed a much more straight forward flip at the Final 11. We also have Malcom and Denise, who should be all but dead at this point if their respective new homes put two and two together and realized there was no way they would have more loyalty to each other than themselves.

Rather, that is the *main* culprit for a bad season. Because while you can admire the impeccable gameplay specimens such as Brian Heidik, Boston Rob and Kim Spradlin, the Survivor community has also come to something of a consensus that it was their dominance that has made Thailand, Redemption Island and One World some of the less beloved seasons by consensus.

When looking at these three games, these players merely ran the table on immunities while keeping their tribe mates from mustering a coup, taking the goats of the group to the finals and winning the money. 

Meanwhile, and in both the game always hung in the balance every episode. While great players like Parvati and Russell controlled these games for the majority of the home stretch, neither was truly in such a commanding position that their win was inevitable and obvious. When we look at non-All Stars seasons such as Amazon and Tocantins we see the same thing; groups of competent players who exerted enough control to be successful, but never enough to remove suspense (though the best player in both of those seasons lost).

- The start of the game is a whole bunch of new twists! 20 contestants, schoolyard pick, double elimination. More on this below.

- No merge: For the first and only time in Survivor history the tribes never merged. Instead

- Fire-making tiebreaker: In the case of a deadlocked vote

- Exile Island: Exile Island makes its debut appearance in ep10

**The Winner: Tom Westman**

Tom was a strong, winning 5 immunities, but showed that you can also play a strong, controlling strategic game and still be well liked. Forming the game's most solid alliance on day 2 with Ian, and Katie (and Steph), Tom was in a power position from the start. Together with Ian, they make up one of the strongest duos Survivor had/has ever seen. Adding Jenn and Gregg as part of their alliance ensured that Tom would never be in any danger at Koror. Tom took on the leadership role at Koror not only at camp, and it resulted in the biggest Survivor beat down of all time. Behind Tom's leadership, when he blindsides his alliance member Gregg. After a whole bunch of crazy stuff his original alliance of him, and creating subtle back-up alliances such as Steph and Caryn. It allows him always see threats coming

**CHARACTERS**

- **Tom**: The leader of everything Koror. Dominated physically

- **Katie**: Annoying and bitchy to everyone outside of her alliance, and then jump to the next person that makes the decisions."" She did execute that strategy, as she was able to align with Tom and Ian from the beginning, but she had no gameplay to stand on and the jury tore her apart at FTC.

- **Ian**: Tom's right hand man from day 2, ending in one of the craziest moments in Survivor history. 

- **Jenn**: At times it seemed like she was more interested in dating Gregg than playing the game. In the majority alliance

- **Caryn**: Unaligned

- **Gregg**: Strong in challenges and a good strategic player. He is able to control Jenn's vote

- **Stephenie**: The debut season of Survivor's strongest female cometitor. So strong in challenges, but is never able to get back into the game strategically. 

- **Bobby Jon**: Just brute force, and his strength keep him valuable to Ulong, but he loses a fire making challenge to Steph in the end. 

**What if/Why Moments**

- What if Steph is picked to be on Koror. She already had an alliance with Tom

- Why is there no strategy at Ulong? Just because you suck at challenges doesn't mean you can't strategize. No alliances going on at all. Koror's 7th and 8th members have more game than Koror's top people. 

- Why does Ulong suck so bad? They have two of the strongest female competitors ever in Steph and Angie, and either did Tom continuously beating down BJ in alpha male scenarios.

- What if at Ulong final 3

- Why don't Gregg and Jenn flip at first vote after conquering Ulong? They had talked about it, Caryn, Coby, and Janu. This was Gregg's chance to take control of the game, but he was too much about sticking with the plan.

- Why no women's alliance at 7 left? In Katie's words it's ""because Karyn sucks"". Partially true

- Why does Ian jump down and have Tom take Katie to FTC? WTF WHY?! The guilt from Tom and Katie was too much and ""friendship is more important"" according to Ian. Ian's exit has us go from potentially best FTC ever to arguably worst FTC.


**Underlying Themes**

- **Tom and Ian**: Aligned on day 2, both did an excellent job at having good relationships with everyone and complimenting everyone daily. The season was their's from start to finish and Ian's voluntary exit denied us of a truly great FTC, though Tom probably still wins. 

- **Janu's drama**: On Koror, but quickly became a lazy, complainer around camp. Day after day Janu laid and cried in the hammock, not caring if she went home. Janu is the first to quit the ""drown yourself"" challenge and becomes the first person ever sent to Exile Island. After hours of trying, Janu is able to start fire. She enjoys her night on Exile so much she returns to Koror a rejuvenated women saying she had come ""full-circle"". At tribal on day 27 Janu tells Probst there is ""no reason"" Koror should keep her and becomes the 4th Survivor quit, but really just the 2nd behind Osten from Pearl Islands imo if you don't count Jenna (mom sickness) and Sue (violated, humiliated

**Controversial Topics**

- Wanda infamously outs 7 Palau recruits. This was the first season to ever use more than one or two recruits, Ib, BJ, and Gregg were recruited, while Jenn and Ian were Amazing Race applicants sent over to Survivor. After Palau the number of recruits per season continued to rise, resulting in 17 of 20 contestants being recruits in Fiji.

**Overall Season Rating**

Palau makes a strong case for being a top ten season. A fresh twist to start the season, fishing, and roaming area for camp. There is a subtle military/ww2 theme going on, but it doesn't add much. Pre-merge is so one-sided and a majority alliance dominates leading to a predictable final 3 which may deter some, but for me, I loved to see it unfold. This is the most extreme case a season can get to, and I'm glad it happened at least once. Tom Westman plays a style of game that had never won before by dominating physically, and socially. He proved it's possible to be in control strategically and still manage a jury. He won a record 5 immunitties

Cochran would have won regardless, they all had exactly the same opinions about everything and I think that is definitely a result of them being together at Ponderosa.

Cochran.......want to go for a drink? 

I feel like Phililip if isolated would not have thought that way
Without Ponderosa would everyone think voting Brenda out was a cardinal sin?  After all
The end result would be the same but if they were separated you could actually see their personal reactions to the final three.  Not a hive mind developed over drinks at Ponderosa where they were all pissed not to be in the game anymore and formed this narrative together about why the final three suck.


Here is my assessment of the final three
Sherri: did well strategically but was no good socially
Dawn:did well strategically
Cochran: deserving winner

Thoughts?  Hive mind created at Ponderosa or if isolated would they all have the exact same feelings? 


EDIT: ""I feel like Phililip if isolated would not have thought that way

What I mean here is not that they would have voted differently.  Likely they would still vote for Cochran but they wouldn't all ask pretty much the same types of questions or have the exact same feelings about each of the three.  Having them all together at Ponderosa forming a unified opinion on the final three doesn't necessarily change the outcome but I think it makes FTC way less interesting.  If you think of Survivor as a social experiment it's as if they are taken out of the experiment allowed to debrief with each other and then put back in for the conclusion.

The result: After the members of the other tribe are voted out, takes two goats (people who have no chance of winning) with them to the final 3.

Begin rant:

It got me to thinking why we have this recurring theme of Pagonging on Survivor. Then I started to look at the cast. Lately, a few token minorities, and one or two token gay men or women.

It's rather well known that Survivor recruits some of their castaways each season from places such as night clubs or wherever attractive 20-somethings hang out. Lately

Look at this season. Correct me if I'm wrong, interview process, and physicals, don't you think the majority of those applicants would be Survivor fanatics?

Think about it. Colton's love of Survivor was seen as being a big deal. Tarzan and Jonas cried when they found out about Colton leaving because it was supposedly so unique that Colton loved Survivor. Last season, and Troyzans tenacity should be the norm and not the exception. ESPECIALLY, when you are picking 16 people out of an enormous pool of applicants. 

Instead

Maybe if the producers picked people who actually wanted to be on the show so bad that they applied through CBS.com -- you know, half of those 8 or so contestants they are recruiting from night clubs end up being goats. It makes the final 3 boring because the show is formulaic.

Instead, while before I used to like over half the castaways. I think it's due to the disappearing reality element of Survivor. Survivor, like all reality TV, is becoming more unreal over time. I'm sure there's some term to describe that phenomenon, but I'm too lazy to look it up.

1) One idea for pre-merge: you may not play the HII for yourself, Jeff would surreptitiously call on that person to be one of the people selecting a player, and some other winner picks the other.  All non-winners would be sequestered together under some pretense.  That way, winner or loser, the HII holder has opportunity to pass the HII to a member of the other tribe.

2) HII's cannot be played for yourself, voting as usual; Jeff doesn't make this announcement until after votes are read.  If the person saved by the HII receives the most votes, Jeff makes the reveal.  If not,  a) the idol goes back in hiding on the original beach, or b) the idol is somehow(?) given to ""Renee"" for future use, or c) ?

3) Pre-merge - HII clues are hidden in reward challenges.  This would have to be a ""taking turns"" type obstacle course challenge with stations.  For instance, but there is also a sign at that station that gives you instructions for finding a clue elsewhere.  You'd have to walk away from the sand-pit with your team watching, wondering why you're abandoning the challenge to go attempt to retrieve the clue (maybe it could be in an underwater compartment that you have to dive for or something).  Each player has to decide whether attempting to retrieve the HII clue in full view of the tribe and potentially at the expense of the challenge win is worth it, and how much time to divert before losing too much advantage to the other tribe.

4) This one is just a something that popped into my head and I haven't analyzed whether it has merit or not.  Post-merge - Eleven players join the jury.  Instead of HIIs

1354992747.0,14iacj,Applying for Survivor? Why CBS prefers recruits over applicants,,22,4,20,"Have you seen the average application video? Assuming Youtube submissions are representative of most fans

**1)Survivor wants characters**
Describe any iconic player. When you describe Boston Rob, and lives in Pensacol...uh. You say he's dominant, controlling, charismatic, assholish, etc. It's the same with any player. They are defined by their characteristics and not any superficial qualities of boring home-life.
 
Somehow the average applicant seems to think that describing the mundane details of daily life makes them an attractive candidate for the game. They brag about things/places they have been/done/seen as if that is a substitute for who they are as a person.

Older men wax poetic about their kids and white-collar jobs. Older women strive to show how fit they are. College students regale their high school accomplishments and newfound social finesse. Daring twenty-somethings boast how “if I can survive this

Recruits are helpful in this regard because casting can actively select a particular character they want for a cast. Recruits can be a specific role (jock, outcast) instead of a useless ""everyman"". If everyone claims they are “socially, mentally, and physically perfect for Survivor”, then no one is.
 
**2)Familiarity breeds contempt**
Survivor fans are annoying. Some players can turn their encyclopedic knowledge of the game into an endearing quality
I imagine that hearing the (copyrighted) Survivor theme hundreds of times warrants an immediate rejection by casting. The intense discussion of the current season suggests ridiculous self-importance on the part of the applicant; as if casting cares/isn’t aware of anything you can possibly share about the game.

The worst offenders waste valuable application time lecturing about game strategy instead of setting themselves apart as a potential player.Recruits

**3) Storytellers**
Survivor relies on confessionals to see how a player is thinking. What is a confessional but a story? The fact is: most applicants don’t know how to tell a story. They can give fragmented and disjointed segments of themselves playing sports or rolling in the snow

The people that have success throughout casting are those who can sit down and engage strangers with a story. There are exceptions

1353597172.0,13mes1,Penner's strategy,Prax150,24,3,26,"I noticed a lot of people wondering what the Hell Penner was doing saying no to Lisa and Skupin

For starters, and he doesn't trust any of them, but they trust him. If he said, ""sure I'll be in a final 3 alliance with you"" and then circumstances forced him to vote them out, that's 2 votes he doesn't have if he makes it to the finals. This way he can say that he was honest with them no matter what happens, he keeps his hands clean and he's not suckered into an alliance that he might have to break.

But I think it goes deeper than that. Penner's really smart and he's clearly had a good handle on how this game's been playing out. We saw last night (through some great editing) that all it would have taken was one vote (Skupin) to flip the game over again and vote out Malcolm

Pete won reward and he was fresh for the challenge. Obviously it didn't play out as he wanted to, so there's no point going after him. That leaves voting groups of Denise and Malcolm and Pete and Abi that are safe, making Skupin, Lisa, Penner and Carter the potential targets. Carter is sort of a wildcard and while he's a physical threat I don't think they'd target him. 

But the other three? Lisa would certainly be a target for Pete and Abi, instead of being able to get closer to Malcolm, Pete or who ever. 

So not pledging allegiance to Lisa and Skupin could hurt him in the final six, should be fairly straightforward.

So that's how I see Penner's reasoning for what he said to the two when they approached him. Will it lead him further in the game? Probably not,,False,self,t5_2qhu3,False,,True

Kim played, except for Rob on his fourth go-round. She put herself in the middle of five-people, creating two groups of three that each believed they were going to the end. And she told each group that she was lying to the other group. This is textbook winning gameplay and she executed it perfectly. Plus, she was earnest and real enough that even those that she voted out were willing to vote for her in the end.

As for characters, the naive crazy girl who ends up experiencing enlightenment after being voted up (when has that happened, ever???). Troyzan, the textbook ego-maniac. And of course Kim, the collected glue that holds an alliance together for longer than almost any in the history of the show.

The final tribal is often so bad and so full of bitterness that my wife and I literally don't watch it (DVR, this is just my opinion, I think Tarzan's presence at the juror resort really created the calm and reflective atmosphere at the end of the show.",,False,self,t5_2qhu3,,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/tq1qk/well_i_loved_this_season/

**SHOW AWARDS**

**Best Challenge**

- **Final Immunity, while Rudy and Kelly battle for hours. With all of America anxiously watching, Kelly outlasts the former Navy Seal to earn FTC.

- **Final Immunity, an all women final 3 battle it out on the often used challenge. Of the three times this challenge was used, this was the best. All three women last for hours before Kathy loses balance. Vecepia becomes the first person to to ever strike a deal at a final immunity challenge, as she breaks her deal with Kathy and steps off to give Neleh immunity under a promise of FTC.

- **""Contact Zone""

- **Stand on a perch in the water, chocolate, and coke. 

**Best Premiere**

- **Borneo**: Never before had something like this happened. 16 contestants are put on a tropical island with minimal supplies. The first ever challenge

- **Amazon**: A gorgeous cast is immediately separated, but ultimately win the first immunity challenge to send a guy home first.

- **Pearl Islands**: The contestants start with the clothes on their back and are sent to a fishing village with 100 Balboas. The difference in tribes is staggering as Sandra's spanish speaking gives Drake a big advantage. A unique start centered around a pirate theme. This premiere had so many little moments like Rupert stealing shoes, and more!

**Best Final 4 On**

- **Borneo**: Hatch and his alliance all make it to the final four and now have to turn on each other. A great final immunity

- **Marquesas**: The one and only purple rock tiebreaker at final four sends Paschal home. Vecepia breaks a deal with Kathy and gives Neleh final immunity. Our first bitter jury! After a slow season

- **Amazon**: Jenna vs 3 men

- **Pearl Islands**: A misfit collection of unaligned players

**Craziest Nature Moments**

- **Skupin

- **Wild Animals

- **Fire

- **Hatch, then smashes its head on a rock. 

**Worst Twist**

- **Outcasts Tribe

- **Purple Rock Tiebreaker

- **Fake Merge

**Best Twist**

- **Tribe Swap

- **Men vs Women

- **Surprise Start


**TRIBE AWARDS**

**Worst Tribe**

- **Pagong, the Pagong tribe was picked off one by one resulting in the original 'Pagonging'.

- **Samburu, resulting in one of the worst camp lives Survivor had seen. They also broke pretty much all of their canteens and water pots which didn't help in Africa.

- **Sook Jai

- **Jaburu, the Amazon women did win 4 out of 7 challenges.

**Best Tribe**

- **Tagi

- **Chuay Gahn**: Led by Mr. Freeze himself. Not a very strategic bunch

- **Drake

- **Chapera, complete with benches and a swing, and had a family like bond. They stay completely unified taking 6 of the top 7, and all of the top 5. 

**Best Alliance** (These are my made-up names that I use to keep track of them)

- **The Founders, Sue, and Kelly Wiglesworth. All made the final four.

- **The Big Three, and Ethan make the earliest, most solid alliance the game had seen. They take 3 of the final 4 spots and Ethan wins the season.

- **The Fair Five, Neleh, Vecepia, and Sean team up as the underdogs with 9 left and coast to the final 5. 

- **Romber, they had deals with just about everyone at some point, and they both made FTC.

**INDIVIDUAL AWARDS**

**Best Pre-Merge Player**

- **Skupin

- **Shii-Ann

- **Burton, he proves he is a strong strategic player as well as physical.

**Best Runner-Up**

- **Colby

- **Matthew

- **Rob

**Best Hero**

- **Colby

- **Elisabeth

- **Paschal

- **Rupert

**Best Villain**

- **Richard Hatch

- **Brian Heidik

- **Jonny Fairplay

- **Boston Rob

**Worst Strategic Move**

- **Colby

- **Clarence

- **Lex, instead of Amber to please Boston Rob. At the merge, Rob immediately votes off Lex.

**Best Strategic Move**

- **Hatch

- **Paschal, Marquesas**: Realizing they are on the bottom, they flip on their Rotu tribe at 9. Something unheard of at the time.

- **Fairplay

**Best Winner**

- **Richard Hatch

- **Brian Heidik

- **Sandra Diaz-Twine, Sandra lied her way to a blow out win without ever being voted against.

**The Winner: Vecepia Towery**

The first minority winner. Vecepia sums up her strategy in an ep4 confessional saying, than I'm not in it. When drama starts, I walk away."" She does seem to have a high amount of confessionals in the early going for not doing much. I think this is because she is never on camera for anything interesting so they have to go back and get her reaction/opinion. Vecepia is arguably the first person to win by really doing it on her own. She was never overly loyal to anyone other than Sean, and did a good job of forming personal relationships with everyone. She seems to do a great job of telling her group, ""I'm with you"", while clearly separating herself as an individual and bonding with everyone. Originally she puts herself in a good position with Boston Rob, Sarah, but never truly on the chopping block. At 9 people left Vecepia aligns with Sean, and they are able to easily ride this to the final 5.

**Characters**

- **Vecepia**: Stays drama free and waits to be approached for strategy. Pretty much always in a good spot and never in danger.

- **Neleh**: A sweet girl that everyone loves. Is this Elisabeth 2.0? Even her relationship with Pashcel is reminiscent of Rodger. Her game was ""don't cause waves"". She also says ""oh my heck"" all the time.

- **Kathy**: Takes on leadership role early and it hurts her socially. She then mellows out and fits in much better. She was always on the minority and could never find her rock solid ally. The original preacher of ""it should be fair"". She was the founder of the Fair 5

- **Paschel**: The patriotic judge that everyone loved. Such an endearing relationship with Neleh (and Gabriel early). The innocent victim of the infamous purple rock incident. He never had a vote against him

- **Sean**: Wanted to be the alpha male and was never afraid to speak his mind. Forms a tight bond with Vecepia over being black. 

- **John**: The leader of Rotu's power alliance of him, and Zoe. Desperately wanted to be the food provider. Not nearly as smart as he thought he was.

- **Boston Rob Mariano**: The first of four seasons for the Boston construction worker. Shows his strategic prowess from the beginning

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: The least amount of starting supplies ever at this point. Tribes are each given 2 machetes, 1 frying pan, 1 fillet knife, and 1 magnifying glass. No food rations. Jump off the boat with your supplies and paddle 2 miles to shore.

**Pre-Merge**: Completely dominated by Rotu who win the fist 4 immunities and first 6 challenges overall. Hunter thinks he is running the Maraamu tribe because he works hard at camp, and Sarah.

**Tribe-Swap**: Everyone gets a new buff at random. The original Rotu comes out with the numbers advantage on both tribes. Neleh, Tammy, General, and Zoe maintain power at Rotu. Sarah is separated from Rob and her alliance and is the first to go. Kathy comes out the big winner in all of this, as she was never very close with John's alliance. The swap instantly puts two more people under her in the pecking order and buys her enough time.

**Merge**: John is the leader of the power alliance at the merge with him, and Zoe until they clearly lay out to everyone that it's the 4 of them vs the others. For the first time in Survivor, the people on the bottom join together to take out the power alliance at 9 left. After John goes The Fair 5 ride it out until only they remain.

**Final Immunity**: Same as Africa. Stand with one leg on each stump while keeping a hand on the idol. Not the last time we see this challenge either. Kathy falls off first and Vecepia immediately strikes a deal with Neleh that she will jump off if Neleh takes her to FTC. This sorta goes against the deal Vecepia made with Kathy at the previous tribal

**FTC**: Vecepia makes it clear that she did not ride any coattails to get their and that she stuck to her own strategy while preaching her strong personal relationships. Neleh meanwhile praises god, but everyone sort of votes how I would expect. John, Tammy, and Robert are too bitter at Neleh for flipping at 9, and formed better relationships with Vecepia. Those 3 votes plus Sean supporting his longtime ally is enough to win. John is the deciding vote as he seemed to be the only vote that was undecided going in. The difference might have been Vecepia handling a tough jury with strong, confident answers, while Neleh struggled with the simplest of questions

**Craziest/Funniest Moments**

- Sean describes Sarah's arrival on the raft as ""Cleopatra"".

- Maraamu starts fire on day 1 with a magnifying glass. Quickest in Survivor history at this point. Rotu gets it on day 2.

- The original Maraamu start their days with a morning radio show hosted by Sean featuring Hunter on weather, and Sarah on beauty.

- Kathy pees on John's hand after he gets stabbed by sea urchin after several others get stage fright.

- The ridiculous nono bug bites!

- Rob ""The General"" slices his toe pretty badly on a rock. Same episode John gets bit by an eel. You never know when these kinds of injuries will get infected.

- Kathy gets Maraamu lost on a tribe hike. Sarah gets annoyed and wants to go back to camp but can't find her way.

- Sean blows up on Gabriel because the Rotu tribe is work

- Ep5 has the first ever Survivor camp raid

- The final 4 Maraamu members become expert crab catchers.

- Rob gets Zoey to lie to his face about her alliance

- Final 3 Maraamu members find a human skull buried nearby.

- Rob confronts Zoey and gets her to lie again

- Sean has a bad case of the farts.

- After John gets voted out

- Paschel tips $200 on his dinner reward using Probst's credit card.

- The purple rock tiebreaker at final four. Paschel never has a vote against him

**What if/Why Moments**

- What if Gabriel joins Boston Rob, but for Gabriel that should be better than going home. If it stays deadlocked then maybe we get to see the purple rock tiebreaker in action, and then maybe production realizes it doesn't work at four people.

- What if Kathy doesn't win the first individual immunity challenge? Her name is floated a lot

- What if there is no pecking order challenge? Without this challenge Paschel never wakes up and realizes there is an alliance of 4 and Sean goes home at tribal. This likely leads to John's alliance dominating like they thought they were. 

- Lots of what ifs for Kathy at the final 5. If she doesn't win immunity she could very well be eliminated since she doesn't have an ally. Does she make the right decision in sending Sean home? It is hard to imagine a scenario that doesn't involve a deadlocked final 4. I do think she should have broken up Paschel and Neleh, but Vacepia sort of double crosses her at final immunity. 

- What if we have a fire making contest at final four like they were supposed to? Kathy vs Neleh

- What if Neleh takes Kathy to FTC? This is a stretch because Kathy was considered a favorite at that point, she just didn't have the game to win over a jury. 

**Underlying Themes**

- **Location**: Season 4 was originally scheduled to be filmed in Jordan for Survivor: Middle East

- **Religion**: Religion comes up in this season more than any other. Everything is praise god/god is good. Lots of prayers especially by the two finalists. Tammy slams them at FTC for hiding behind the veil of religion while they lied and manipulated.

- **""It should be fair""**: It's the principle that the majority alliance of Vecepia, Paschel, and Kathy is based upon. Leads to a pretty honest and straightforward post-merge.

**Interesting Season Notes**

- Maraamu's water source is a small rocky creek bed

- Fire is never given as a reward in the form of matches/flint this season.

- Rotu wins the first 4 immunity challenges of the season. The largest immunity streak to start a season until Koror win all 7 in Palau

- Rotu wins the first 6 challenges overall. The largest winning streak to start a season until the Drake tribe of Pearl Islands who also won 6. The Moto tribe wins the first 9 challenges of Fiji.

- Ep5 has the first camp raid in Survivor history as a reward for the blindfold challenge.

- Gina doesn't win a challenge until day 13. I'm not positive

- Ep8 had the first ""pecking order"" challenge. Such a good challenge that plays a huge role this season. Also becomes a common recurring challenge in future seasons.

- This is the first season where everyone's loved one is there in person.

- In all of the first four seasons

**Controversial Topics**

- The purple rock tiebreaker. If the votes are deadlocked, whoever draws the purple rock goes home. A fine tiebreaker, but it doesn't work with only four people left! With someone holding individual immunity, and the two vote receivers becoming immune that would only leave one person available to draw rocks. I repeat, it doesn't work with four people! Instead the final four tiebreaker is supposed to be a fire buidling contest between Kathy and Neleh. The producers use the purple rock tiebreaker anyway, making Neleh, Kathy, the producers used the wrong tiebeaker at the wrong time

**Overall Season Rating**

Marquesas ranks very low in my Survivor season rankings. Marquesas is certainly nothing special as a locale and has no truly entertaining characters after Rob leaves. The Fair 5 made for boring tv,,False,self,t5_2qhu3,1372656317.0,,True

**Medallion of Power**: A dumb idea that never resurfaces in other seasons. When played a tribe receives an advantage at the challenge. Advantages like these almost always result in a victory which is too powerful. The Medallion was retired after 4 episodes.    
**Old vs Young**: Exile Island had 4 tribes divided by age and gender, but once merged had no lasting effects.


**Winner**
**Jud ""Fabio""**
- A careful observer may have been able to predict this in episode one. Fabio is the first castaway to appear on camera as well as have the first confessional. Later in the first episode Fabio says in confessional ""I don't care what they call me
- **His Game:** Fabio is on the minority alliance from the beginning with the young people. He is constantly on the chopping block as the one to go not this time


**Characters**


- Fabio: The winner. Definitely played dumber than he was
- Sash: Tried to found the Minority Alliance
- Chase: Biggest paranoid ever. Made his own alliances mad by constantly freaking out over strategy. This guy could not answer a question at Tribals to save his life and it cost him in the end losing by one vote.
- Jane: The North Carolina girl that everyone loved. No strategy
- Brenda: She was in such a good position at the merge. Her problem was she was ""with"" both the people that had HII
- Marty: The only original Espada member with any strategic game play
- Naonka: One of the craziest characters to ever play. And it all ends in a quit?! With a HII?! Naonka was one of a kind...
- Purple Kelly: Purple Kelly makes this list because she may be the dumbest person to ever play survivor. She gets little to no edit

  
**Season Summary**

  
**Pre-Merge**: Pre-merge is dominated by the young La Flor tribe. Brenda, and Sash form the power alliance leaving Fabio and others on the outside. Meanwhile at Espada, the older people have zero clue what strategy is and are playing the game based around who do we like at camp? Marty is the only older person to form an alliance getting Jill, Holly, and Dan who all say, just tell me who to vote. At the tribe swap the lack of strategy from older people becomes apparent as the lose control of both tribes.     
**Merge**: After the merge the theme of this season becomes, Chase, Jane, and Sash had control, but lost it. There was no such thing as loyalty this season, and that helped Fabio in the end as he was always in the minority alliances and never had to betray anyone.


**Craziest/Funniest Moments**


- First tribal for La Flor
- Holly fills Dan's $1400 shoes with sand and throws them in the ocean. In the same episode
- Naonka goes ""hood"" on the handicapped Kelly B. after a reward challenge to get the clue to the HII.
- Jane catches her own fish
- Naonka steals the tribes flour, and fruit because no one appreciated the tortillas she had made. Alina becomes an accomplice by sharing the fruit and is then voted out.
- Marty gives Sash his HII for the promise of 2 more tribal councils. Sash gave him one more and then voted Marty out. 
- Naonka and Purple Kelly quit on day 28
- The Libertad camp burns down. After stacking 3 wooden chests around the fire and going to a challenge the camp is ruined, machetes, among other things.
- Ep13, I'll put it out"".


**What If/Why Moments**


- After the tribe swap why does Alina stay loyal to Naonka and the young people? She was clearly on the outs with Chase and Naonka yet stayed with them to vote out Tyrone and Yve. She is then left with no alliances at the merge and is the first to go. Meanwhile at the La Flor tribe
- What if Brenda, and Naonka stayed strong as an alliance. They then have the only solid four in the game and both hidden idols. In a season of no strong alliances, this seemed like the likeliest one.
- What if Naonka and Purple Kelly don't quit on day 28. Naonka has a hidden idol and becomes a candidate for ""take me to the end, but it would change some things. This event also leads to a Survivor rule change stating that producers can remove quitters from the jury.
- What if Chase didn't suck so bad at answering tribal councils. Throughout the season he blunders his strategy in front of Jeff and the jury, he refuses to answer Marty's ""dumb as a bag of rocks award"" question, actually insulting Marty in the process and losing his vote. Second, Fabio gives one of the best answers to a jury question ever. Naonka, asks him about his mom and his motivation. Fabio responds with an emotional answer that brings Naonka and jury members to tears. With this answer Fabio steals Naonka's vote.


**Underlying Themes to the Season**


- The weather: This season and season 22 RI are filmed in Nicaragua. While seasons 19, and 24 are in Samoa. This seasons rain in Nicaragua seemed to be some of the worst Survivor has seen, eventually causing 2 people to quit. Flooding seems to make fishing impossible and food really runs thin this season.
- The previews for ""next week on Survivor"" became a string of ""what will Naonka do next?"". She stole all the tortilla supplies for camp and people barely even cared. Only Naonka could get away with this stuff.
- Was this season's cast constricted to a tiny camp area? Every time people are talking strategy


**Overall Notes**


This Season is placed in an awkward spot. Survivor was on such a high since around season 13, but not bad by any means. Fabio's laid back style probably hurts him in the standing of Survivor winners though. Imo the Pre-merge lacked any real strategy and the new twist of Medallion of Power was dumb. The Merge was lackluster, and no one player ever really emerged. The winner, Fabio, never had to make a big move, or a real strategic decision. ",,self,,

But, gameplay standpoint I think a good case can be made that Dawn has been *the most critical player* this season. And, if she makes it to the final 3, it's hard to argue that she didn't make the *right* decisions.

Starting right after the merge, ended up being responsible for eliminating Corinne without giving away that she was doing it. If Dawn goes the other way and sides with Corinne/Malcolm, Malcolm, Eddie, Reynold, Corinne and Michael would likely have rounded out the final 6 - a virtual total reversal from who actually made it to 6.  That decision basically set in motion the votes for the next 5 weeks (minus the blindside of Andrea and Brenda).

The next week, but it probably would have worked if Phillip wasn't so bad at hiding his intentions.

This past week, Brenda, and Sherri.

The entire game other contestants have been looking at Dawn and thinking she's at the bottom. The reality is that no one has had more power and been more responsible for shaping the game than Dawn. There is no more powerful position in survivor than being the swing vote and Dawn has been in that position three times since the merge. The only other players to be in that position

If you take out all of her dislikable qualities, especially considering the difficulty of beating Malcolm or Brenda at FTC.

Matt showed some great tact and strategy playing nice with both sides and using his alliance with Michael (that Michael initiated) to control his stake in the vote. I think he could have easily swayed Michael to vote with Reynold, and Eddie if he'd wanted to.

1375317332.0,1jgl83,Survivor 11 Guatemala Breakdown,SurvivorNut27,29,11,28,"**New Twists**

- One returnee per tribe. Former contestants return to compete against rookies for the first time. Something that was a unique twist until the more recent seasons of Redemption Island

- Hidden Immunity Idol. Ep8 marks the debut of the HII. The HII must be played before the votes are read and is never re-hidden. The rules of the HII continue to evolve over the seasons. 

**The Winner: Danni Boatwright**

Danni admits on a Survivor Oz interview that she purposely hid her strategy so that producers could not interfere on her plans, ""I don't know what to do"", ""I don't want anyone to go."", and ""it's such a hard decision"". She is a strong, athletic female competitor which immediately puts her in a good position on her original Nakum tribe. While the men are in charge, Danni seems to be the highest ranking woman on the tribe. After the tribe swap we get to see some of Danni's gameplay. Despite being up 4-3 in numbers on the new Yaxha, Danni votes out her ally Blake to gain the trust of Gary, BJ, Danni manipultes Judd and Steph's relationship to put doubt in Steph's mind and gets her to flip on Judd. Her name is still floated around and she is still the odd one out a little

**CHARACTERS**

- **Danni**: She hid her game strategically

- **Steph**: Returning from the previous season in Palau, and along with her closest ally, Rafe, they are making the decisions of who goes. In the end the jury was made up of those she had betrayed and it cost her. She also came across as much whinier/bitchy than in Palau.

- **Rafe**: The unlikeliest of challenge threats, Rafe does an excellent job at forming bonds with everyone and is in a great position all the way until final 3. He is also affected throughout the game by his morals and doing what is right.

- **Lydia**: Hopelessly optimistic and positive

- **Cindy**: The zookeeper was a fierce competitor. She was part of the Nakum majority for the post merge

- **Judd**: The loud alpha male who had a bit of a temper on him. Forms a tight bond with Steph after the tribe swap

- **Gary**: A former NFL quarterback, but is still eliminated by the Nakum majority.

- **Jamie**: Loud at challenges and paranoid around camp. Jamie was in the majority

- **Bobby Jon**: Returning from Palau

- **Brandon**: A farmer from Kansas who you couldn't help but like. The only male Nakum not to be killed by the opening hike. He wanted to play a straight and honest game


**What if/Why Moments**

- Why is Guatemala the forgotten season? One of only two seasons (One World) to never have a player return, but normally it is the winner who is narrating the journey along the way. Well Danni decided to hide her strategy which led to zero useful confessionals from your winner, which led the season to center around the story of returning player Stephenie (and BJ). The narration turned into a tale about how Steph lost more than anything else, which obviously makes a season less memorable. The cast is another problem. While everyone who made the merge is a solid ""B"" character, none of them are that ""A+"" character that can carry a season.

- Why don't BJ and Steph work together? The two had more of an annoyance for each other

- What if Danni takes Rafe to FTC? The deal was in place, Judd, and Cindy. Rafe also had stronger relationships with the jury on a personal level. I'll still take Danni to win, but I think Rafe gets at least two votes. 

**Underlying Themes**

- **Playing vs Rookies/2nd Chance**: BJ and Steph are invited back to compete in a season of all rookies, which put them comfortably in the majority. Steph came back ready to do whatever it took to win, which worked up until FTC. BJ came back with the same work ethic, but again wasn't the most strategic guy.

- **Surviving Guatemala**: The opening challenge of an 11 mile hike was one of the toughest ever, and ridiculous amounts of mosquito bites. This and the lack of additional food sources led to very lethargic camp life.

- **BJ vs Jaime**: ""Southern people

**Overall Season Rating**

The narration centering around Steph's return and failure, no secondary food sources, no swimming, led to a camp life reminiscent of Africa. The twist of returning players was unique and interesting, but gave Steph and BJ an advantage. Overall, Survivor Guatemala is a bit bland and unmemorable with no crazy events or classic characters, which is why I place it towards the lower half of my season rankings. Danni admitted to hiding her strategy from the cameras which makes it challenging to judge her game. She was clearly a strong female, but the narration would have you believe it was more of a Nakum collapse. In the end

I think this is largely due to the fact that we had a master of strategy (Yul)


**Yul's** gameplay was, while at the same time working the jury votes.  Not only could he easily motivate and manipulate people, but every time there was a confrontation he  managed to play it down.  By the end of any confrontation someone had with Yul, they liked him more by the end of it.  He just deflected everything so calmly and efficiently there really wasn't any big fights.  By the end of a game it wasn't even a contest, and there really weren't even any close calls with him.  His use of the Idol was ridiculous -- he didn't even have to play it to get the benefit from it (though, the Idol was OP that season).  Still, I would love to see him back at some point.  Really impressive to watch (so much so

**Ozzy** also impressed me this season.  I had only seen him in South Pacific.  What impressed me about him was his physical gameplay -- Ozzy straight up dominated against seemingly much larger, but he won so many challenges that again, it was almost a forgone conclusion that Ozzy would make it to the end.  

**Penner** is one of my favorites to play survivor.  He is very eloquent, his problem was he was overtly strategic.  This did not mesh well with many others who were doing the same thing he was, but with secrecy, and those who just wanted an Island adventure and did not want to talk strategy.  His biggest mistake (aside from fostering mistrust from EVERYONE) were the people he allied with in the beginning -- Flicka and Candice.  Neither of them were trustworthy people, and he misjudged their character.  I would have loved to have seen how it would have played out if he stuck with his original tribe.

So all you Tyson, here where you can upvote your favorite ""crazies"" to your hearts content! Because fact of the matter is, as fun as these guys are to watch, chances are, they'll never win survivor.

I will post each season of Survivor as individual comments and people will reply to each season comment with their own personal contestant from that season. If you see your favorite

I will take the top 3 from each season and add them to a bracket which I will post and everyone can vote on. I'll post the link to the bracket in this post and in its own post so it can be easily found.

Rules!

* Please include the full names and nicknames of contestants that you are nominating!

* Only players from their original seasons can be nominated. All-Stars and HvV will not be options to nominate from and for the seasons with new and veteran players (Guatemala, South Pacific, and Philippines) only the new players can be nominated.

* If you wish to give a reason behind why your nomination should be upvoted make it a reply to the nomination post and do not include it in the nomination post itself. You can also comment on names suggested by others users and spark a debate. Debates are good: This is the internet

* I will wait a few days for the votes to come in and then I will get the bracket set up. (Actually

* Feel free to base your nominations off of the contestants games in all seasons they take part in (shit, but they can only be nominated in one post to keep it fair.

You guys might have remembered Survivor Chronicles ORG being advertised here

Let me give an explanation on how exactly a Survivor ORG plays out. A Survivor ORG is an online reality game held on a custom forum, get placed on a tribe, compete in challenges and of course go to tribal council. Everything and anything you would see in Survivor is possible in our game, there is always the possibility of finding a few twists. All of this is done through our forum and AIM but there has been cases in past ORGs of tribes meeting up on Skype. 

The game will last about six weeks but you won't need to be online all the time

We're looking to start in about two weeks so if you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact us at:

- Men vs Women! For the second time ever, and a more accurate splice of America. 

- Double Tribal: Both tribes go to tribal on the same night and both tribes vote someone off. Technically this happened in Pearl Islands after the Outcasts won the immunity challenge

**The Winner: Chris Daugherty**

""I had a dream that I would be playing the game the way I am, because I tell you what...You don't step it up, and you don't start playing the game in your best interest to benefit and go to the end, you'll be sent packing. Going home with a million bucks...That will change your life."" Not since Brian Heidik of Thailand had someone been able to lie and deceive so much, yet be so trusted by everyone. Chris was very good at evaluating situations and not letting any one sneak by him. He always covered his bases and had others to watch his back. When in the power position, Chris handles it perfectly. Chris was a gifted speaker, always subtly dancing around direct questions to give non-offensive answers. He does an excellent job at getting people to feel like they are the ones making the decisions, Chris realizes his only way of surviving is pleasing the women. He realizes the game is never over, seemingly making him the obvious first target on the guys tribe. Instead, I prepared to play the game""

**Characters**

- **Chris**: Constantly lying and deceiving

- **Twila**: Her game took off after she was able to interact with the guys. She played both sides for most of the time saying

- **Scout**: The eldest women

- **Eliza**: A strong physical and mental player. She was on the chopping block almost the entire time, but stays with the women, but then eventually flips to align with Chris. Eliza has a constant feud with Twila and Scout, but is in an alliance with them from 7 on. Eliza played a great game to stay alive and make final four, but ultimately Chris turned on her.

- **Julie**: The biggest flirt of the season, he puts her on the jury.

- **Ami**: The leader of the all women alliance. A strong competitor who got a bit cocky with the power after the merge. Felt betrayed by Eliza who she had protected. 

- **Chad**: A nice, the first to compete on Survivor. 

**Season Summary**

**Start of Game**: Everyone goes through a real rite of passage tribal ceremony. The Vanuatu natives divide the contestants by gender and clearly treat the men as superiors to the women. The men are given kava to drink, 1 pot. Pretty cool start.

**Pre-Merge**: At Lopevi, athletic guys. This gives Chris, Chad, Sarge, Rory, and Bubba the early power, with Sarge as the face of the alliance and Chris as the strategy behind the scenes. The Yasur women are divided by age and work ethic. Eliza originally sides with the older group to give them power. Ami seems to be in the most control

**Tribe Swap**: The tribe swap puts Rory and Bubba on Yasur with 5 women, Chris, Sarge, and Chad decide to take in Julie and Twila, and vote off John.

**Merge**: It could be 5 new Lopevi vs 5 new Yasur, Eliza, Scout, and Twila, realize they are on the bottom of the women's alliance and flip to save Chris, resulting in one of the unlikeliest final fours. 

**Final Immunity**: Hold a bow and arrow in a warrior pose, endurance, a bit of strength. To say Chris was favored in this challenge might be an understatement. Scout goes out first after releasing her arrow. Chris tries to get Twila to step down with a deal, but after she tells him no chance it turns into a bit of trash talking, with Scout obviously routing for Twila. Twila releases her arrow after about an hour. 

**FTC**: Chris says he deserves it because of the odds he overcame as the last man. Twila says she played hard and played to win, calls Eliza names, and won't apologize. Chris gives a  ""sincere"" apology that is the perfect answer, 1-0. Julie breaks down immediately over Chris, still heartbroken he betrayed their brother/sister friendship. Chris again responds well, saying their friendship was true and that he is sorry and hadn't planned on hurting her. Another perfect answer, even getting emotional during it, and involve too many unnecessary apologies. Chris convinces Leann by telling his story of perseverance, 3-1. Chad tosses up an easy question to each asking, match. From there Sarge rips into Twila for lying on her son's name and then tries to use reverse psch on Chris

**Funniest/Craziest Moments**

- On the hike to camp after the opening ceremony

- Chad reveals he is an amputee.

- The men lose the first immunity challenge because Chris can't get across the balance beam. ""In this game you outwit

- Rory gets upset back at camp because the women were celebrating and dancing after winning a reward challenge. 

- Twila tries to stab a wild chicken

- Rory, the caller, yells at him to stop.

- The afternoon before the first women's tribal is so hectic. Eliza, who thinks she is the swing vote.

- Sarge is upset that Rory takes a lot of walks and breaks.

- Twila and Mia get in a fight over camp work ethic.

- At the second Yasur tribal

- Winner of reward gets 24 hours with a native of Vanuatu. Now that's a reward!

- Rory is the caller during a puzzle challenge. He loses control and everyone ignores him.

- The men argue about sleeping locations around the fire. Bubba always takes the best spot and refuses to give it up.

- EARTHQUAKE!

- Tribe's are each told to select a chief. The chief's become captains. One captain divides the tribes

- Ami doesn't want to show the guys their cool camp tricks because she is so pro-women alliance.

- At the first immunity challenge after the tribe swap while waiting on the tribal mats, and Ami hears him, which leads to him going home that tribal.

- Rory plays up his anger after Bubba is voted out. Culminating in a cheesy speech the next day. Actually a great strategy

- Eliza doesn't catch a single pig at a challenge and people were pissed. At a later immunity challenge when pig-catching is used again

- Julie's weird flirty relationship with Sarge. She sunbathes naked next to him

- Lisa says to Ami

- Scout and Ami make Lisa swear her loyalty to them on an invisible bible. 

- Rory breaks the tribal immunity idol as he slams it into the ground.

- The women paint each other's bodies. Julie goes to tribal with a heart tattoo that reads ""Jeff"". Probst and Julie go on to date for a few years after the show.

- Rory is the first to go after the merge

- The pecking order challenge gets fierce with 9 left. 3 guys out first

- Leann and Julie bring back chicken wings from reward. They give them to the girls who run and eat them in the woods while the three men are on the boat. Then they tell the guys they could only bring back the chicken bones. The men love it and are grateful for the little meat. Well played.

- Julie puts doubt in Twila's head by saying the guys promised her the same deal.

- Chris tells everyone that Sarge told him to vote for him. 

- Scout becomes unhappy that Leann and Ami have put Julie ahead of her and Twila. Decides she is going to flip with the guys when she can. 

- Chris, Ami drink a bowl of kava on reward. Chad gets wasted off of the kava and can't stand/walk.

- Chris gives one of the all time great confessionals, she'll snap your neck! You open up your heart, show a women you're vulnerable, then they start thinking with their heart. That's when they open up that back door. That's what's happened this time.""

- Chris stirs things up after Chad is voted out. Reveals Scouts/Twila's plans of betrayal to Eliza and Leann.

- Twila swears to Ami and Leann on her son's name that she is with them 100%. Leann goes home and the promise haunts Twila the rest of the game.

- Loved ones participate in immunity. Chris seemingly going home if he loses. He does lose and his wife starts crying, Twila, and Scout team up and take over majority. 

- Ami has it out with Twila/Scout back at camp after Leann goes home instead of Chris.

- Twila gets sick of people bringing up the promise she made. Goes off on her alliance member

- Chris loses reward by not seeing/using one of his puzzle pieces.

- Twila buried bananas in the ground to ripen and won't tell people where they are. Threatens to let them rot.

- Twila over hears Chris and Eliza talking final two. Causes a fight between Twila and Eliza.

- Twila says at tribal that Eliza doesn't deserve to be in final 5.

- Chris's confessionals are the only true glimpses of how he feels. All live footage and conversations is him lying and being fake to people.

- The stare from Eliza at Chris as she is voted out is priceless. His reaction of 'yea

* We just did a ""favorites vs."" season.  I can't see doing 2 of them back-to-back.

* The logo shows one couple holding hands

* The name of ""blood vs. water""

* The ""blood"" tribe will be family members related by blood (brother / sister, you don't hold hands with your brother or cousin).  The ""water"" tribe will be family members *not* related by blood (married couples, in-laws, perhaps even ""bffs"").  The married couple is the one holding hands in the logo.

* But most importantly

If you have family vs. favorites, whichever couples happen to make it to the merge are going to team up and take out all the single players who make it to the merge.  It is the simplest and most obvious strategy.

And that's because it is so much easier to execute.  To form a 6-person alliance, there's your 6 person alliance.

But now let's look at having family members on the same tribe:

Pairs have always been dangerous in Survivor and every student of the game knows that forming a close and obvious bond with another player puts one, you instantly become less of a threat (and dramatically so) because you now only have one vote... while everyone else essentially has 2.

And this is the part that is starting to make **this concept really interesting to me**:  When you target a couple consisting of one returning player and one newbie, but your real objective is to break up the couple.  And if you're doing that anyway, you may as well vote out the expert.  **So, IMO, this format really puts the returning players at a disadvantage**; which I think is a good thing.

You could still have couples getting to the merge and taking control, there shouldn't be enough couples left to take control.  (And if it is an imbalaced tribal immunity, then it is no different than regular 'ol Pagonging that we can get any season).

I’ve attempted to do this.  I also tried to guess what place a cast member comes in if they do not win.  I do not believe there are any discrepancies, tweets from the cast and Ponderosa videos to gauge votes.

For a while, these are opinions.  If alliances hold true and there is no interference from Erik or Eddie by way of winning immunity, I agree with the popular opinion: we’ll see Cochran, Dawn and Sherri.

**Cochran**

The current jury likes Cochran.  They respect his play and his physical performance.  Additionally, too.  If he makes it to the end, I think he wins.

* Dawn &amp; Sherri - WIN
* Dawn &amp; Erik - WIN
* Dawn &amp; Eddie - WIN
* Sherri &amp; Erik - WIN
* Sherri &amp; Eddie – WIN 
* Erik &amp; Eddie - WIN

**Dawn**

After Brenda

* Cochran &amp; Sherri – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Erik – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Eddie – LOSS
* Sherri &amp; Erik – LOSS
* Sherri &amp; Eddie – WIN
* Erik &amp; Eddie – LOSS

**Sherri**

Sherri has been a lock at 3rd ever since she flipped to the favorites.  Her ex-fan tribe won’t vote for her.  The favorites view her as a pawn.  She’s the only person I comfortably guess is a lock for the final three.

* Cochran &amp; Dawn – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Erik – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Eddie – LOSS
* Dawn &amp; Erik – LOSS
* Dawn &amp; Eddie – LOSS
* Erik &amp; Eddie – LOSS


**Erik**

Erik is a darkhorse.  He’s been described as harmless and non-strategic in exit interviews.  Andrea even said he told her “the best strategy is no strategy.”  But I believe he is doing one of the best flying under the radars ever.  I don’t think he’s even trying to win all the challenges.  I don’t think he can beat Cochran, without Cochran, he wins.

* Cochran &amp; Dawn – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Sherri – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Eddie – LOSS
* Dawn &amp; Sherri - WIN
* Dawn &amp; Eddie - WIN
* Sherri &amp; Eddie - WIN

**Eddie**

Eddie has consistently proved he has no idea what is going on.  He can basically beat Sherri

* Cochran &amp; Dawn – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Sherri – LOSS
* Cochran &amp; Erik – LOSS
* Dawn &amp; Sherri – LOSS

**Before the show starts**

Get in the best shape you can before going on the show.


Learn how to hold your breath for a long time.  It’s not that hard to learn and might give you an advantage in a challenge.


Practice swimming.


Practice doing puzzles.


Learn about knots and practice untying knots.  This is common in challenges and you could have an edge if you practiced.


**Gameplay**

In the beginning of the game


Be ready to adapt your strategy to the current situation.


Don’t trust someone because they swear on their family.  They’re no less likely to go back on their promise, really need you to believe them.


If you find a hidden immunity idol


It’s better to use a hidden immunity idol when you don’t need it


Personal attacks are a great way to lose jury votes and embarrass yourself on TV.


Assume that people will lie to you and break promises if they think it’s in their best interest.  Be ready to do the same.  Don’t tell someone something just because they ask nicely.


Never offer more information than necessary.  It could be used against you later.  Knowledge is power.


Be careful how you answer Jeff’s questions at Tribal Council.  He tries to dig up dirt and get you to say something that will cause drama and conflict (making the show ‘better’


Try to get people to think you don’t have friends on the jury.  They might be more likely to take you to the finals.


Lose gracefully.  Don't go out like a sore loser and don't be a bitter juror.  More great ways to embarrass yourself on TV.",self,t5_2qhu3,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/survivor/comments/1091ff/some_thoughts_on_strategy_and_gameplay/

No one will give you their vote if you attack who they are as a person outside of the game, belittle them, and refuse to treat them with respect.

As I've posted before, I could see Kim or Chelsea preferring Kat on the theory that she's more beatable.
