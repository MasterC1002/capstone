1375501538.0,1jlx34,"On the topic of ""boob armor"" and other related female armor issues.",bigsol81,126,31,69,"Maybe it's a case of confirmation bias or because I've only recently returned to playing M&amp;B, I've seen numerous debates pop up over ""female"" armor

**Boob armor is impractical.**

First, it wouldn't work so well for chain or plate armor. Your chest needs to expand so you can breathe, and you don't want the armor pressed right against you anyway, because it would transfer shock to your flesh and cause serious injury even if it did stop enemy weapons.

Second, and putting a ""valley"" right over your heart is pretty suicidal, as it would essentially redirect attacks right into the center of your chest. Also, that hard steel ridge in the center could do some serious damage if you fell off of a horse, or took a solid blow to the chest from a sledgehammer or other blunt object.

**But it would distract men to see my female form!**

I can assure you that if you're charging at a man with a spear or a sword intending to murder him

Your pretty

**So

I will give many of the female armor supporters one thing: Calradia's not like Earth. Women are capable of equaling men in physical prowess

But what would it look like?

Well, or especially [this](https://dviw3bl0enbyw.cloudfront.net/uploads/forum_attachment/file/67121/20110609000111632.jpg). There are, however, examples of armor made for women that has been proven to, at least, allow for improved comfort for women that are well-endowed.

[This](http://fc00.deviantart.net/fs70/f/2011/044/6/2/female_armor_by_golentan-d39ic16.jpg) is an example of armor a woman might wear. It provides increased room in the chest without sacrificing protection.

[This](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-8oh_I-jTAdY/UOwafCcuW-I/AAAAAAAAZJk/DA-T8x9QEnM/w395-h583-no/tumblr_m28rerx6mP1rty7tao1_400.jpg) is another example. Again

[This](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-4PSEBaO5t6k/UOwaa2RBxPI/AAAAAAAAZJw/TOQrISL9Q9s/w374-h820-no/IMG_0372%255B1%255D.jpg) is probably the most extreme example you'll find that's still realistic (though she would likely be wearing mail under it, of course, that there are no ""boobs"" on the armor itself.

Honestly, and [this](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-Ttdi93y4lRc/UOwkGUNtWVI/AAAAAAAAZLk/RcVkKsdsV-I/w351-h598-no/Snow-White-Armor-05%255B1%255D.jpg) are what you're going to see when it comes to ""realistic armor"" for women, since, with very few exceptions, there aren't many women out there that are well-enough endowed that they would need their armor expanded.

**What about ceremonial / dress armor?**

*This* is about the only time where something like boob armor could (but likely wouldn't) be seen. It would be armor meant to show off ones' wealth, and many other wealthy nobles during Roman and Greek antiquity had armor custom-made to fit their forms, and these armors were often shiny, engraved, polished, and decorated in elaborate ways.

However, so if they were added to the game, I would expect them to be unusually heavy, have low protective value, very high cost, and likely come with some kind of skill penalties as well.

So, wealthy, self-centered noblewoman might wear armor like [this](http://www.freakygaming.com/gallery/concept_art/age_of_conan:_hyborian_adventures/female_sexy_armour.jpg) in a parade or while addressing her subjects, it's incredibly unlikely that she would even set foot on the battlefield wearing it.",,False,self,False,t3_1jlx34

So, soon after I took the town and established a court the Nords raised a siege. At this point, I had only 30 troops vs. 100 enemy troops. All of the other Nord armies were raiding my villages. I quickly sent my diplomat to go arrange a peace deal: I forfeit my independence and I would have to make my way to the Nord king to swear fealty again. 

After I sent the diplomat, and then the peace deal went through. I swore fealty to the Nords and everything is peachy now. However, I was one minute away from losing everything.

But as i was playing the ACoK mod, are quite limited by the game as to how nasty they can be, despite the fact that they were quite evil in the books. Dwelling on this, I thought it would be interesting if, in the next M&amp;B game, they gave the player some options to be really nasty in how the play the game. A few things I thought of were:

- The ability to kill other Noblemen. This is something that has been brought up a few times for the older M&amp;B games too, due to the way they are programmed, but I always thought it would be an interesting feature that, if you captured an enemy lord after a battle, you could then be given the option to behead them, as opposed to simply imprisoning them. This would lead to some possible severe relationship gains/losses between your character  and the other nobility, but it would be great for RP purposes. 

- The ability to raze villages/towns/castles. I have seen that one of the features purported to be in the next game is the ability to build and modify castles, then another feature I would love to see is that, once you conquer an enemy holding, you can put it to the torch and destroy it for good. 

- The ability to use gained controversy as a means to intimidate other noblemen. In the current game, to an extent. In the next game, I think it would be interesting if, once you had gained a large amount of controversy (from all that beheading and torching) you could use that to buff up your persuasion skill. For example, speaking to another noblemen whose nation you are at war with, you might say: ""You should join my side, because if your side loses I will behead you and will burn your holdings to the ground.""

In this post I want to hear your general thoughts about the new Mount and Blade. What do you want to see and what do you not want to see.

Personally I want to have a more advanced commanding system. Don't get me wrong

They could perhaps have a setup before the battle where you can set-up where your units shall be placed

Or you could have like an pause option where you can pause the game in mid-combat and command your units. Cause I feel like I have about 20 seconds before their army reach mine to setup my army and after that it's pretty hard to do effective commands while everyone fighting each other and you are being chased and getting fired upon. 

Steam workshop support would also be nice considering all the awesome mods for the original M&amp;B like Anno Domini 1257 and graphic enhancement.

I would also love to see more open maps to battle on,,False,self,t5_2qzpd,1375232947.0,,True

Though the biggest thing I hope to see is some actual story. Say what you will about Mount and Blade, characters, or any narrative. I want Calradia to feel unique and original, but I also want to keep a sense of mystery and wonder about it.

I want to visit castles perched high above waterfalls, and be memorable. Too much of the game is copy-paste castles and cities. Have them be unique.

I want a better realization of Calradia. This place has been at war for hundreds of years. All of these people are claimants to the Imperial throne, and so on. The place should feel dark, it should feel like it is, has, and always will be at war.

I want a sense of urgency in the plot. Sure

I'll start by saying that I'm enjoying Floris a lot but there is much more room for improvement. This could be a long list but I'd just like to see what can we come up with and maybe one day some of these things get fixed :)

1. Garrison management. We need to be able to select more than one group of units. Mouse selection, in which wave etc...)

2. UI. Floris improved the native UI (reports screen is good) but it is definitely something that has to be in the game by default.

3. Time sinks have to be removed. I mean, that way I don't have to break every mouse when playing with slavers.

4. Impact on the world. The ultimate goal is to have a kingdom (at least for me it is). That should stay complex in gameplay mechanics, communication with vassals and similar stuff should be easy to do, maybe even from anywhere on the map - I don't want to return to Yalen every time I wan't to renew trade agreement with someone, for example.

5. Having more power over vassals. I feel more as a servant to other lords when I'm a marshal or a king. If I'm powerful, all the while I'm conquering half the map without their help and they're getting all the fiefs and money.

6. Territory and city managing system like Medieval 2:Total War has (upgrades, non-military units). Cities should be able to stand on their own and not need me to babysit them.

7. Non-military units should have their own slot in my party. Want to send a message to the marshal? You have to use one of your designated scouts

-The female unit line is very fragile until fully upgraded to sword sisters.

So I'll need to carefully protect and train my troops until they level up.

**What needs to be done**

A comprehensive logistical and economical ruleset for the campaign needs to be made.

A ruleset for various things like retreats and army composition needs to be made for battles.

Logistical, and historical information needs to be accumulated to base the rules and components of the game on.

As detailed maps of Europe around 1800-1810 need to be collected.

-----

**Campaign Ruleset**

Logistics: Rules for troop movement, civilian logistics.

Military: Recruitment, troop movement.

Armies: How armies on the campaign map translate to the battle.

Economy: Simplified national economy, infrastructural improvements.


Battle Ruleset:

Retreats

Player behavior

Two days later the battle started. I bid my men a fond farewell as I took my place to the left of the ladders. The battle was long and my legion earned their name over and over. We stood and we fought the invaders to a halt almost before a stray arrow took me out. Disheartened by the loss of their commander my men pushed the enemy back for a time. 

I assured them I could fight, and only had thirty men left. 

Without their commander though

You control independent armies that happen to fight as allies, so I ordered them to stand still, and made sure I unloaded my whole quiver into their heads every round. After killing off their ~100 strongest warriors this way, I was able to fight them and win.

Another cheap but not cowardly thing I did was, after 3 failed sieges, I ordered my units to stand still, ran up the ladder, and maneuvered to fall over the edge behind the defenders (the defenders left an opening, they only group up when several units attempt to go up the ladder). No one chased me, so I was able to walk back up the stairs, and snipe the defenders. Even when the reinforcements came

The thing that however has finally I think pushed it over the edge into unplayable for me is the size of the faction armies, and how close everything is together.

This screenshot is one example:

http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=150623098

I've literally been dealing with something like the above for 450 in game days straight in game. As soon as a war with one faction finally ends (they seem to go on for an eternity and a half)

In this screenshot, but this has finally killed my desire to keep playing. I counted and this was I think 3650 or so troops attacking my town here (keep in mind this is after 400 of my own troops had been killed or wounded, so that's after their own casualties as well, they originally had more). I was on the other side of the game world when war was declared with this faction again, and by the time I got back (passed at least another 400 on the way back after killing 450 right at the war's outbreak), my town had already been besieged and the battle had gone on for a while. My original garrison was around 500+ troops, almost ENTIRELY top tier. The garrison alone was around 10k a week to pay with 25% pay reduction from leadership. Throw in my own party and I'm basically bankrupt despite having an enterprise in every city (which don't work half the time due to the aforementioned literally endless war). I cannot in any way shape or form afford to garrison anything I own even more than I had.

This is not the first situation like this either, lost it about 25-30 times, literally. If I took it back from them, a 2000+ man army showed up within 6 IN GAME HOURS every time (and I do mean EVERY time), the dust never even settled from the previous battle, and there is no way I could possibly fight the army. The only way I ended up getting anything in the end was to go and immediately take it back after they did and leave a garrison of 0, then just abuse my maxed pathfinding to hit as many things as possible doing this to every one of them to make them run back and forth and slowly whittle them down when they put some of their own troops in the garrisons. My own faction was useless

Beyond that, 2 towns, and at least 2 castles to hit my village). Once again previous statement of faction was useless applies, they'd never help drive anything out or defend.

TLDR: Prophesy of Pendor is a mod where you fight 5000 man armies single handedly that even if you kill them all come back in about 2 in game days at full strength.

The Brits use highly accurate breech loaders that can be reloaded in about two seconds

Despite being far superior on paper the British usually have a hard time winning. If the Zulu's get into melee you will be mobbed and sliced into sausages. It's relatively easy to bayonet the lone Zulu

The mod has lots of potential. The three servers all use AI bots for the Zulus, so that you appear black, but your face clips through and makes you look daft as hell. The battlecries have been replaced, but the British ones are awful and the Zulu ones sound like they've been ripped straight from 60's films. On the whole though it's a solid distraction from the normal modules.

However, then shoot them like fish in a barrel. If you go Zulu they will whine and moan, poll to kick you, act as if you are ""ruining their fun"" just by trying to make the teams balanced.

We joined yesterday and after a while decided to try Zulu to see what it was like. Aside from being really quite fun

We smashed their barricades with our rifle butts, they wept. I gunned down their entire team one round when they built their way onto a 2nd story house's roof and they wiped out the AI. They started to build forts into the sky, abusing the sapper buildings even further, rigging them with TNT so they could suicide rather than let us kill them when they were out of ammo.

They tried kicking us just for being better than them. They changed the map to make it easier for them. This morning a different group of scrubs made up a rule that you cant have more than three Zulu players at once. When we joined, relentlessly, whilst moaning that we were ""ruining it"".

So I come to you reddit, to make the mod as great as it was MEANT, nay, DESTINED to be!

Rodion spent several months with Trimbau, one of the highest tiers of infantry. He followed Trimbau on his campaigns with the Rhodok Republic, accompanying him to battles and feasts alike. At one of these feasts, the daughter of a certain powerful Rhodok lord named Gutlans caught his eye. Knowing that the daughter of the lord of Yalen would never marry a poor soldier, Rodion left Trimbau's army with fond farewells to the Conte and petitioned Doge Graveth for a lordship. Having fought together in several battles and sieges, the Doge was happy to acquiesce. Rodion was given the village of Serindiar, near Grunwalder Castle. 

Now a lord of his own

This inspired Rodion to go to war, one of the great cities of the Nords, and in less than a day put its defenders to the sword. He defended it from the attempts to reclaim it, and was finally awarded it by Doge Graveth, who was impressed by his singlehanded capture of the city.

Now a successful conqueror

Newly married, buying industries in almost every city. Financially secure, Rodion went to Doge Graveth and announced his secession from the Rhodok Republic. Doge Graveth was angered by the fact that Rodion refused to give up his lands, and denounced him. The Rhodok Republic went to war with the newly formed People's Democratic Republic of Grunwalder.

Unfortunately for the Rhodoks, he gave the cities away to the Kingdom of Nords and the Sarranid Sultanate to boost his diplomatic relations with these powerful nations. 

The next two years passed with Rodion defeating every attempt by the Rhodok Republic to attack his lands. Rodion eventually became very wealthy, either. He stocked his castle with almost two hundred high tier crossbowmen and infantry, and also kept a standing army of a fluctuating number between 60 and 120 of high tier troops for defeating invaders. 

Many of the other Calradian nations have declared war on the PDRG

Loving the game, it tells me that ""There is no tactical plan in place."" That sounds like something I should attend to, how would I do that?

Also, is there a way to change which troops come? having 20 archers would be more useful than the 15 infantry, 3 archers, and 2 cavalry I got last time.

I lost the fight but man that shoot feelt so amazing.

1310825623.0,ira89,A Quick Start Guide (for those having trouble getting renown),streamcipher,16,3,16,"I've had a lot of trouble with this myself

1. Start in (or beside) Khergit Khanate. Also

2. Accumulate a group of about 20 Khergit soldiers.

3. Join every tournament you can find, and when your soldiers are fairly experienced, loot every village (and attack every caravan) you can find belonging to an enemy of your chosen kingdom.

And an explanation of the above and why this makes things easy:

1. All Khergit soldiers, along with pathfinding, makes you *very* fast on the world map, very early. Like, 7+ speed. This lets you outrun anything which is a threat to you, and run down anything which is a target. It makes it very easy to hunt down bandits for experience, and also lets you delve deep into enemy territory with little fear of being caught.

2. It doesn't sound like a lot, so you can get good experience from looting this way. Having a small number of veteran soldiers also means you're often outnumbered, which gives you renown when you win. (Additionally, you can recruit a hero character in a tavern and level them up excessively in the medical skills, making it even harder for your soldiers to die)

3. You can out find where tournaments are taking place by asking the Tournament Master in the arena. You can make a lot of money by betting 100 denars on yourself at every round. Attacking bandits should be easy with your speedy group. Helping nobles gains you renown and improves your relations with your kingdom, which makes looting easier since armies are usually protecting the border lands. It also means you can run around looking for caravans and such.

Doing the above is the best way I've found so far to get renown reliably. Most quests that I know of give you +1 renown by the way, please post them!",,False,self,t5_2qzpd,False,,

I have 90 Vaegir archers

I've taken armies down that were 300+ troops without a single casualty. I have begun to forge my own kingdom from the northeast

Right now most of my time is spent defending my castles from my enemy because I don't know how to properly fortify them. I select recruit troops and it just takes my money, I'm unaffiliated with any kingdom, so why is it making my troops Swadian when I'm clearly in Vaegir territory?

Whenever I'm not besieged or destroying my enemy in the field I'm taking more of their towns and castles

I have over 100

My difficulty setting is at 90%.

I was thinking of starting over and building a pure cavalry force

I dunno. Any tips or suggestions on what can spice up my experience? Or should I just resume conquering the world?

(Surely his defeat was due to the absence of his best Vikingr.) So right now I have two days to report to him

EDIT: Well, warned en route to check in with my lord immediately. I find the prison guard, alone, but considerably better-equipped than I am. Since I can't figure out how to actually request to visit with a prisoner, I had no choice but to try to kill the guard and free my Konungr. 

The jailer screams for help, and he fell shortly thereafter without even wounding me. I rushed into the cell, and saw my commander, frail from malnutrition. I thought that he would recognize me for the risk I took to save him (for my own ends, of course), but he only asked what was going on. I told him to fight, and we ran into the streets.

Unfortunately, three headed for me and the rest toward the staircase nearest Ragnar. I pull out my bow and begin sending arrows toward them, but two archers elsewhere on the battlements made that difficult. As I fell back behind the keep, I saw Ragnar, standing where I left him. I feared for his safety, but comforted myself with the knowledge that he was at least six times stronger a warrior than I.

Sure enough, the Konungr had acquired a blade, and began to cut the soldiers down, each in a single blow. Shaken from his stupor by the thrill of battle, Ragnar surged up the stairs to slaughter those archers. Meanwhile, I'd only managed to kill one soldier and wound another, and my shield could not take more abuse. 

Trusting my Konungr to distract the archers, I filled them with arrows, or at least their shields. But it was enough to break one guard's shield, and that was enough for my blade to break the rest of him. I heard the cries of a slain Vaegir and triumphant Nord as I sprinted to the other staircase, hoping to shoot the final guard in the back as he climbed after me.

Sadly, and I had no choice but to turn and fight. My Konungr was standing over the second archer, unmoving. I grew furious at him for not rushing to assist me, his finest and most devoted vikingr. No one else had dared break him out of prison. No one else had killed four times mrore Vaegir in every encounter than he had. And he would do nothing, and let me fall? 

No.

These thoughts occurred even amidst the parries and ripostes, and saw an opening. I'd dodged the guard's greatsword, and for a moment his left side was exposed. In a flash of steel and blood, my blade sank through the mail and into the flesh, and the guard fell.

Within moments, but he was nowhere to be found. He must have called upon Woden to return him home, and again left me to fend for myself. I headed home to Sargoth, hoping to reach it before sunset, when I will be declared a deserter for rescuing the Konungr. 

As luck would have it, waiting in his cozy castle. I spoke to him, and he made no mention of my noble deed, but welcomed me back into his service. I immediately asked to retire, instead. I have no desire to serve this selfish Ragnar a moment longer. No, I've heard rumors of a man known as the Far-Seeker who seeks to rule over the Nords. Perhaps I will seek him out.",,self,,

1310566966.0,iog8n,Favorite weapon(s) in M&amp;B?,rhiever,16,3,31,"A while back

1. **Awlpike**. What an amazing weapon! I was hesitant to give up my lance for a slightly shorter, it can do enough damage to one-shot about anyone. It also does piercing damage, so it will do even more damage to heavily armored opponents. Lances are overrated IMO; while they do huge couching damage (often 200+), that's way overkill even on the big, bad Kings who probably don't have more than 80 hp. With an awlpike, I can ride around killing enemies like I couched them with the added bonus of not having to work with the huge, *painfully slow* and unwieldy lance.

2. **Morningstar**. Another underrated weapon IMO. Like the Bastard Sword, more damage to heavily armored opponents) AND has Crush Block, which will crush right through an opponent's block (shield or parry) if you swing with enough momentum. The only downside is that it's unbalanced so you can't do feign attacks with it very well, but this is made up for by the big damage it deals. I pull this weapon out whenever I'm fighting enemies with a bunch of shields out, e.g., Rhodoks. This weapon is the biggest reason why Swadian Knights dominate the field.

Basically, Archers and Infantry. But lately I'm splitting it four ways between Cavalry, Archers, Infantry and basically a disposable suicide group. They only cost about 25 denars to hire each time, and whenever I start a battle I have everyone hold position, then have the archers go back ten paces so there's an infantry wall in front of them. Then group 4, literally called ""Fodder"" is told to charge the enemy. Pretty much every time they'll kill about half the oncoming infantry before getting murdered by the enemy archers.

Then I just tell the Cavalry to charge, to the point that they're fairly unstoppable now. Yesterday I got trapped by a rebel uprising of 400 people (fairly low level, but still) and we beat them with 80 dudes.

I have been playing them quite a lot and was wondering what everyone else's best tips and tactics were.

I will go first.

* Holding down F1 allows you to position a flag to which your units will move.

* If you have riflemen

* If you have riflemen, or on top of a steep hill for protection.

* If you have line infantry or guards and are fighting riflemen, and your increased reloading speed counts more. Also, don't be afraid to charge them. You will always win in a melee, even with around 2-3 odds on arrival.

* Don't be afraid to retreat back to your allies. Your men are far more useful alive

* Always be cautious of suprise cavalry attacks. Be ready to group your men close together

* Flanking the enemy can do wonders. If you run your men off to one side of a skirmish between two sides, but much of their line does not have a clear shot at your troops. They will often be distracted by the forces on the front, allowing you to get closer before you unleash your first volley.

* If you order your troops to switch to melee mode when you want to advance, and hence dragging behind the rest.

* If you have cavalry, as well as remaining ready to defend infantry from charges.

* Use terrain to your advantage. Hiding your troops behind a hill can allow you to easily flank the enemy

1.**Arenas.** Melee fights and tournaments could feature multiplayer

To prevent boredom when your friend is romancing or gear shopping, you could continue to play your own single-player game, and only when your friend enters a battle do you join their game. At the end of the battle you go back to your single player game. If you are already in a battle or otherwise occupied when your friend starts a battle, the AI takes control of your character in your friend’s game.


2.**Mercenary Attachments.** In Prophesy of Pendor, or have a high renown requirement. Like I wrote above with enlisting, to prevent boredom you could continue to play your own single-player game, and only when your friend enters a battle do you join their game.

I realise now in hindsight that I was not quite ready at all. My right to rule is around 30, so now I am only at war with the sarranid sultante. I have a few questions/pleas for advice.

Is there any way to relinquish my kingdom and resume my position as a vassal of the Rhodok king?

Have I screwed up massively?

So bandit ambushes are pretty much preventing me from really getting far into the game. I was a vassal last time and was doing fairly well and then I get dropped into a marketplace against five maul wielding bandits at close range. My character is pretty solidly built for combat with 4-5 in power strike, power draw. I have fairly solid armor, ~50 head, ~60 chest, ~40 legs or so. Using a balanced bastard sword and war bow. I have fairly good shield too. But I really can't seem to do anything against so many enemies at once, I just get spammed to death and can't get any hits in between blocking.

I'm Surrealbeliefs.

I post more on the /r/totalwar board but I figured I'd come around here too.

I recently began two new series for Gekokujo and A Clash of Kings. 

Gekokujo: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4YUWpVmAqn1Vjo-6inVBfsAq3P6RRuc

A Clash of Kings: http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL_4YUWpVmAqn3aHtiWPpTAatzXz4z-X5i

Here are the following downloads for these mods as well:

Gekokujo: http://www.moddb.com/mods/gekokujo/downloads

A Clash of Kings: http://www.moddb.com/mods/a-clash-of-kings/downloads

For a little bit of a backstory on both mods. Gekokujo is based in the Sengoku Jidai (Warring States) time period of Japan. It's appropriately more history light and very enjoyable overall. 

A Clash of Kings is based on the A Song of Fire and Ice (A Game of Thrones) series. It's primarily focused on the War of Five Kings. It's a pretty hefty undertaking and with other enhancement mods involved has been a pleasure to play.

Basically, as if I hadn't. I went to Praven to meet Rolf after he helped me, and he told me to ask the tavern keeper about a warrant. I did that, and the tavern keeper gave me the quest to hunt down female bandit gangs. I hunted down all of them, and eventually their leader showed up, and the cutscene played. After that, I went back to Praven, and got my money.

After that, given by the tavernkeeper of Praven."" When I talk to Rolf in the tavern, he says the same thing he did before the quest; to go ask the tavern keeper about the warrant. If I ask her, though, she doesn't offer the quest again. I'm guessing this isn't supposed to happen. 

With no way of getting that done, or it is there to represent the highest glory for the stronger."" I figured this meant winning a tournament, but I've already been through about 12 of those and gotten nothing but money and special rewards.

To preface this, I think a pre-combat/pre-deployment phase would be useful.  What I mean by that is a map room-esque screen that shows the player an overhead of the battle space and the respective deployment zones.  The clarity and accuracy of this picture would be affected by the commander and his companion's respective scouting skills (the aggregate of their pathfinding and spotting skills). It would also be nice if the player could go ahead and arrange some of his units prior to initiating the fight, if I could go ahead and line out my infantry and archers and notify my cavalry that they will be escorting me.  Of course once the battle begins the player would be able to make on the spot corrections.  

Bonus idea:  Another neat feature, drum, and/or horn players that would accompany you on the field and relay your commands once given.  I think it would do two things:  1) it would be aesthetically pleasing to have an entourage and add a layer of personal security; 2) it would add a layer of realism as your commands would be delayed, and the delay time would depend on the distance the player is from the unit being ordered, line of sight, and din of current conflicts.

I am having a little bit of an issue with some of the town quests, just cruising around Calradia trading stuff to make a bit of cash, and I thought I'd take the game to the next level and start taking some quests from guild-masters.  They keep giving me ""kill the local looters"" or ""wipe out the bandits"".

1370951976.0,1g45zw,Do defending enemy archers ever run out of arrows?,TrashWater,11,3,8,I'm playing a new game of warband + diplomacy with PBOD. In past warband + diplomacy game I've used the all crossbow/archer army unload and retreat strategy to wear down castle defenses. But I read elsewhere that if you ordered your troops to hold their fire and waited for the enemy to run out of arrows it was a better strategy because your archers would take less losses with their shields up. Well I tried it and it seemed like they never ran out of arrows. There were a few points where it looked like they were about to run out and then a crazy barrage started a happen again. I'm using 1.143. Did they fix this? I'm actually OK with it since I found waiting to be extremely boring and when the enemy has a lot of archers I'm skeptical the hold your fire strategy even reduces your losses much.,t5_2qzpd,True
