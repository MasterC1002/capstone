I'm going to share one of the most insightful top 10 lists I've ever come across.... It came in pamphlet form at my diabetic nutritionists office - titled ""Diabetes etiquette for people who DON'T have diabetes""    

*  **DON'T** offer unsolicited advice about my eating or other aspects of diabetes: You may mean well, is not very nice. Besides, many of the popularly held beliefs about diabetes (You should just stop eating sugar) are out of date or just plain wrong.    

*  **DO** realize and appreciate that diabetes is hard work: Diabetes management is a full time job that I didn't apply for

*  **DON'T** tell me horror stories about your grandmother or other people with diabetes you have heard about: These stories are not reassuring.

*  **DO** offer to join me in making healthy lifestyle choices: Not being alone is one of the most helpful things for me.

*  **DON'T** look horrified when I check my blood sugars or give myself an injection: It's not a lot of fun for me either. Checking sugars and taking medications are things I have to do to be healthy. If I have to hide while doing so

*  **DO** ask how you might be helpful: If you want to be supportive there may be lots of little things I would probably appreciate your help with. However

*  **DON'T** offer thoughtless reassurances. When you first learn about my diabetes you may want to reassure me by saying things like ""Hey

*  **DO** be supportive of my efforts for self-care: Help me set up an environment for success. Please honor my decision to decline a food choice

*  **DON'T!!!** Peek at or comment on my blood sugars without asking me first: These numbers are private unless I choose to share them. It's normal to have numbers that are sometimes too low or high. Your unsolicited comments about them can add to the frustration

*  **DO** offer your love and encouragement: As I work hard to manage my diabetes,False,,t5_2qhsj,True,,june,t3_mehc8

* Please, and take appropriate amounts of insulin for things like this). I appreciate the concern, but really, I know how to take care of my body.
* If you know I'm diabetic, DO NOT try and push it on me. If I'm low and don't have sugar/glucose on me (and I almost always do), I will ASK. But if my BG is good/high, then I generally don't want to make it go higher with a carb-y snack. I appreciate you offering me something, but when I decline, then please stop trying to push the food on me. I've had people say ""well, can't you just take some insulin?"" YES
* Please don't tell me about some miracle diabetes cure you heard/read about, I don't want to hear about it.

So some years ago, but was not properly trained for it (only for guiding) so she does try to alert him

Anyway back to the transplant. He had been on a waiting list for 4 and a half years almost. A couple days ago, but my boyfriend lives over 3 hours away from that hospital, so they have to call him in advance so he can be on his way already. His brother's car was broken (and obv he doesn't have his own) so he had to call a taxi. Except... false alert, on his way there, the doctor called again and told him with these organs it would not work out. Crap... he went back home.

A couple hours again, because I was googling about the surgery a bazillion times and all the links are purple, and I still can't kick this off my mind. It's related to diabetes, so I figured this would be the subreddit for it (also I must say, this is the friendliest subreddit on whole reddit!!)

2. Wake up at 3 am drenched in sweat. Realize you’re low
 
3. Try to recover glucometer without getting off the bed.  Aim blood covered finger for little tiny strip. Miss two or three times
 
4. Results. 40?! Snack time! Oh yeah!
 
5. Move with perceived lightning speed to the pantry on the other side of the house. Be sure to run into every door way and table corner on your way. It’s best if you can stub a toe or two. Snag pump tubing on door knobs. You’ll need some battle scars for the morning. Do not turn on any lights until you reach your destination! 
 
6. Open pantry and grab the glorious juice box
 
7. Pick some food…..Rice Krispies! Frosted flakes would be better but they will do. Make your way back to the kitchen for the giant bowl and milk. Prepare the cereal. Remember seeing  fudgecicles in the freezer the night before. That sounds good too
 
8. Don’t forget  to put the cereal box away somewhere strange. See apple on the counter, it must stay.
 
9. Bring food back to your bed room
 
10. Blood sugar is returning to normal, roll over and go back to sleep.

I know there are many people that have it worse than me, everyone knows I love joking about the 'beetus... but truth be told, it is always burning in the back of my mind that I'm most likely stuck with this for life. Not a day goes by where I'm not thinking of the consequences I might have to deal with; that I'm more likely to die before the rest of my friends. That I could lose a toe if I step on something. That I could lose a leg or an arm because my sugars go too high. I might go blind. I might go so high that I go comatose, or so low that I have a seizure in my sleep and don't wake up. These are the most terrifying parts of this disease. I can deal with the needles and shots. But not knowing the future is scary to me.


10 years ago I was simply being told that I'd have to suck it up and take shots every single time I eat, just watch what you eat and take insulin!"" I didn't realize that there are things they don't tell you when you are in the hospital. That emotionally, keeping your head straight is worse than the physical pain.

I may not be the best diabetic, will happen. But as of today, my diagnosis anniversary, I am going to look forward to things that I want to do with rest of my life instead of constantly worrying about things that COULD happen. 


It has been a battle, than bring it on. I have been through a lot, and there is nothing I can't handle now. I spent my childhood afraid of the future. Now, I am not afraid.

Strong diabetes management can be a battle for many of us
 

I just ask anyone who wants to participate to please [fill out the survey before the challenge begins](http://bit.ly/xi4BYo). The survey is *crucial*

----
**Goals for the Challenge**

* At least one person experiences an overall improvement in glucose levels.
* Participants as a whole experience better glucose control during this period.
* That some participants continue the habits made during the 21 days after the challenge.

----
**How the Challenge Will Work**
 
 
* Promise **yourself** three weeks of better diabetes management.
 

* Those participating will [fill out an anonymous survey](http://bit.ly/xi4BYo) before and after the challenge. If you are a lurker

* The first week will be used to collect the data and spread the word about the challenge. **The official start of the challenge will be on February 8th**

* I will post a breakdown of the data at the end of the month to show any changes in average glucose levels of the subreddit to see how we did as a whole.


* Those that they are participating in the challenge will be issued [blue flair](http://i.imgur.com/IF8V0.png). 

* If you feel stuck at any point, and free of judgement.)
 
----
**Some Things To Consider**

These are a few minor changes in care that have great marginal benefit:
 

* Check your sugar at least 3-5 times a day.
  

* Check your sugar before eating meals.


* If on insulin

* Be dilligent and proactive with your medication.


* Make more of a conscious effort to count carbs.


* Try not to beat yourself up and dwell on high readings or bad control


* Be open to include more exercise/healthy lifestyle choices during this time period.


----
 
We already have a few people who are on board with the challenge- *awaxa* and myself included- so this is definitely going to happen. Even if no one else accepts the challenge
 
**Please upvote this so more people can see it.** I receive no karma since this is a self-post.

**Remember**: all of the surveying is completely anonymous. We will not know anything about your diabetes unless you openly share this on the forum. 

**TL;DR: I challenge you to make minor improvements in your diabetes care for 3 weeks. If you're joining the challenge

Forewarning: This probably gets a little graphic at the end..... But I wish for nobody to experience what I have.... and if it'll help you than I'm glad.... It's not really written as a ""SCARE YOU"" story.... but as a ""this is the shit I've gone through story."" I was warned since I was a kid.... ""If you don't take care of yourself

I've been diabetic since I was 10

For the most part, and my parents would ask me good questions, and treat me like an adult. They cared, but they stood behind me and watched me do what I had to do.

I continued this up until junior year (I believe) of high school. That year my friend got diagnosed as a type 2 (he was a big over weight). It all started to go downhill from there.

We would leave early to go to lunch (being a diabetic), and it gradually became every day. I still checked my blood sugar at home, and I'd still stop by the nurse's office and check it if I felt extremely low or high and do what I needed to do to correct it.

Looking back

Continue this for another year and then some. I graduated high school at 17

The girlfriend I had at the time

I was carefree and wanted to be more ""normal"". I had an insulin pump, and I wound up checking my blood sugars less and less. Needless to say, it got to be where I'd check my blood sugars *maybe* once a month.

This continued for awhile, I got a job working in a recycling company on 3rd shift. My father worked 1st. This worked out well, because I'd be at work while he was asleep. When I'd come home, he'd be at work. We rarely saw each other.

He'd always ask me ""Are you taking care of yourself son?"" As a naive and stupid teenager I'd get angry at him and say ""Of course..."" He'd ask what my blood sugars were and I'd make up some good number and he wouldn't question me again.

At this point, I'd call the endo and she'd write more.... I'd always come up with an excuse not to make it to the next appointment.

My father knew something was up

I ended up losing my job

My father demanded I pay like $200-300 in rent (I don't remember). I told him that for that price

I get my own place with a roommate and live by my own rules at this point. I check my blood sugars even less frequently... seriously.... everything was by “feel"". I bet I checked my blood sugar once every 2 - 3 months if something felt really fucked up.

This continued for over a year until finally I was out of insulin.... The doctor would not write me another script unless I actually came to visit her.

I visited her, the blood sugar when I checked it in her office was always ""acceptable"" so she never really questioned my care and assumed I was taking care of myself.

Fast forward a year or two more. I was 20. (Diabetes running damn near unchecked for 4 years now). I start having vision problems out of one of my eyes.... I ignored it

I went to Sears and got an eye exam. (I thought I only needed glasses). As soon as I went back and did the eye exam

He left the room, and I would eventually need surgery on it. He told me it was because my diabetes had gone unchecked.

I was still kind of smug at this point

I couldn't feel any of this shit..... The reason my A1Cs were always good was because I had drastic lows that would even it out.

We've been getting a lot of posts lately that ask the community questions along the lines of ""I am experiencing x, do I have diabetes?"" or ""Should I see a doctor?"" The answer to the latter question is generally, ""*YES. You should see a doctor!*""

We would just like to remind anyone seeking out a diagnosis that **we are not medical professionals**. We are just a community of people who are diabetic or know someone who is diabetic. We kindly ask that you equip yourself with a little more information about symptoms

Just remember that everyone experiences symptoms differently, we do understand that some people may be uninsured, anxious, scared or in need of seeking out reassurance from a supportive and helpful community such as r/diabetes.

Therefore, and to also rid the subreddit of some of the repetitiveness we've been seeing lately. So my question to you, the r/diabetes community:

*What are the best resources you could provide to someone who is unsure of whether or not they have diabetes? Or to someone who is looking for a diagnosis in general?*

I will compile a list of proposed links and edit them into this post. Then I'll make a banner at the top of the subreddit that links to this post

I would ask you to please upvote this post (I do not receive any karma as it is a self post) so that new visitors to the community can see this.

Regards

I just finished working a small temporary job at a children's hospital in the Dallas/Fort Worth Metroplex. I won't give the name

Now I don't know how if any of you have ever worked for a hospital, undergo a full physical, and receive more innoculations than I've ever had in my life. I can't complain, it's a children's hospital.

During the health screening the subject of my diabetes came up. The nurse who was working my screening asked how I had managed to cope without insurance. So I advised her that I was self-medicating with Novolin. 

Long story short

They had been supplying insulin, which cost them roughly $250 a visit. Given the number of patients that they see each year with diabetes, the hospital administration estimates that this will save them over 2 million dollars a year. 

This money is going to be put directly back into the hospital

I just thought y'all would like to know. I discovered that Novolin R, at such a low cost, through this subreddit. Had I not come here I would've never known, and that knowledge is helping a local hospital aid several hundred additional children per year. ",,False,,False,t3_1f7zfd

To figure out how long you need to wait between taking your insulin and eating:


1. Check your Blood Sugar (this is a given)

2. Take the first two digits

3. Wait that amount of time.


So for example, and use those as my time. So I would wait 17 minutes after taking insulin to eat my food.

If you don't know what the /r/Diabetes Challenge is

Anyway, but it's finally done. Remember, the data I am sharing with you does not necessarily reflect everyone who participated in the challenge, nor everyone in the subreddit- only those who participated AND filled out the survey before and after the challenge.

----

**Here are the results:**

Average BG Before the Challenge: 150 mg/dl or 8.33 mmol/l

Average BG After the Challenge: 137 mg/dl or 7.61 mmol/l

~~Do the math

[Thanks to Planckover2pi for his input](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/ryla6/rdiabetes_challenge_the_results_are_in_traffic/c4ab65f)

71% of people who participated and gave surveys had lower blood glucose levels after the challenge. However, had still remained in the range of 80-135 mg/dl, or 4.44-7.5 mmol/l.

**[Here is a graph reflecting the progress in mg/dl.](http://i.imgur.com/syJNY.png)**

**[Here  is a graph reflecting the progress in mmol/l.](http://i.imgur.com/4vOwL.png)**

I would say the challenge was success! Thanks to everyone who participated! We learned a lot from the experience and got very helpful feedback in the surveys. We plan on doing this again sometime in the near future

1358298745.0,16nl83,Emergency room visit today - accidentally hit a vein when injecting. Long story and questions inside.,WattersonBill,65,20,45,"Diabetic of 5 years here


Storytime:

Last night I took my normal dose of Lantus, I noticed that the injection site on my thigh wasn't bulging, which it normally does. I also felt no pressure beneath the skin, which I normally do. As I pulled out the needle, the site immediately started to bleed. Not just a drop of blood, but a little stream of it, running down my leg. 

My first thought was ""Shit. I might have gotten a vein or maybe muscle."" So I searched some diabetes blogs and found very little information. Every once in a while I'd find somebody post a story about how they accidentally hit a vein and they went hypo almost immediately. 

So

**1:04am - 140 mg/dL**

""Alright

**1:07am - 131 mg/dL**

**1:09am - 114 mg/dL**

**1:10am - 106 mg/dL**

At this point

**1:12am - 89 mg/dL**

I wake up one of the other kids in my apartment and start to explain to him the situation. I start chewing glucose tabs as quickly as I can. I am petrified at this point. 

I decide that if I can't get my numbers to stabilize

""What if I mess up? Why can't you do it yourself?""

""This is for the moment I pass out on the floor.""

""Oh.""

**1:15am - 74 mg/dL**

I keep eating sugary things. I've never gone below 40 and am barely staying calm. 

**1:17am - 66 mg/dL**

I lose it and call an ambulance. I don't want to wait until I can't think straight before seeking medical attention. My numbers aren't slowing down. I check one more time before waiting for the ambulance outside. 

**1:18am - 61 mg/dL**

For some reason I grab a sack of granulated sugar on my way out and sit on the curb. The ambulance comes, and tells me to hop in. 

He is relaxed and doesn't seem to worried about the situation. We arrive and he is cracking jokes about the sack of sugar. I feel about the same as when I left my apartment. I get taken in and a nurse checks my blood sugar. She says it is 68. She jokingly chastises me for eating sugar and ruining my teeth. The is not appreciated. 

The staff periodically checks my levels and gives me glucose water

Around 3:30 my blood sugar hits 99 and they tell me I can head home. As I'm waiting for a cab

**3:31am - 92 mg/dL**

The cab ride only takes 10 minutes and I check the second I get home. 

**3:42am - 52 mg/dL**

I just about fall on the floor. I am so exhausted and full of disgusting sugary things at this point

I boil some water and pour half a cup of sugar in a mug. I melt the sugar with the water and drink it in one sitting. Nausea is really hitting me at this point. But a make another mug of sugar water with about a third of a cup this time

**3:51am - 63 mg/dL**

**3:58am - 92 mg/dL**

**4:03am - 124 mg/dL**

**4:09am - 148 mg/dL**

I'm not sure when enough will be enough. But I realize that once the insulin is done, but I stay up and keep checking because I know it could drop at any point again.

**4:19am - 170 mg/dL**

I start to get my hopes up about leveling off. I drink a little bit of regular water

**4:25am - 143 mg/dL**

I nearly start crying. I can't handle this anymore. If I start really dropping again

**4:28am - 120 mg/dL**

I feel defeated. I start drinking the second cup of extreme sugar water and debate whether I should call a cab or another ambulance. 

**4:31am - 146 mg/dL**

A little bit of hope again.

**4:33am - 158 mg/dL**

**4:35am - 171 mg/dL**

**4:39am - 196 mg/dL**

**4:46am - 212 mg/dL**

I finally broke 200. I have **never** been so happy to see a number that high. I stay awake for another 45 minutes

I set an alarm for 7:30 am

**7:32am - 240 mg/dL**

Relieved

I check my levels again at 9:30 and noon. They stay between 180 and 240

Anyone else had something like this happen?

Any advice for what to do when this happens? 

I might have over-reacted a bit

1354357246.0,143kkt,This sucks.,barringtonlevy,50,2,46,"Hi guys

I've been T1 for 17 years, managing this shit is just too much. All of my friends and family see as this guy who can  manage throughout anything, as this ROCK who can tough out anything. I've never spoke to my friends or close cousins about the hardships of being Diabetic. Ever. Then days like this when shit just starts adding up, my injection sites are sore, and I just don't want to inject one. More. Time. 

What is a man to do? I'm supposed to be this funny outgoing guy who isn't brought down by anything. Who can I talk to? I just want yo tell my friends and family that this shit sucks. That I hate it. That for a few moments every day since I was five years old I hate life. That injecting myself every time I eat a meal sucks. That I just wanna go out and have a good dinner and relax. Without having to get up and fucking stab myself with a needle every. Single. Time. I. Get. Hungry.

Sorry if I'm ranting. But what is a guy to do when I'm the one who has never let his ""disability"" get to him? Am I not allowed to text my brother/sister/cousin saying ""I fucking hate this."" I never do, I've been living this way for 17 years. Why is it hard now? Why tonight. Why do I feel like crap now? And why is it so hard for me to just text my brother or cousin saying ""being Diabetic sucks"" I don't know.

I don't even know what the point of my thread is, friend. No one should feel like this. And if you're newly diagnosed, please please please, for me, talk to everyone you can about it. Don't create this weird stigma in your head that people will look at you different. Because as I grew up, I realized that the people who look at you different just aren't worth the time. And the people who will be able to support you need to know that you need that support, ever after 17 years, I'm kind of drunk and alone.

Anyways, this is all I know.

To use this script:

1. Open the spreadsheet.
2. In the Google Drive menu
3. Click New
4. Replace the contents of the script with my script (that is

I've had highs, these years have been tough. I've gone through things I could never have come up with in my wildest dreams.

I wonder how my eight year old self would react, up until this very moment. It's never totally out of my mind, as I'm always having to consider so many little factors throughout my days; things like what I'm eating, when I last dosed, whether I exercised that day, and so much more. And sometimes, as any diabetic will tell you, you end up high or low anyways. And that's when it gets frustrating, close your eyes

Yet here I am, and I've done my best to make the most of this reality of mine. I've always tried to joke about my diabetes, and having it has really given me a chance to appreciate life. I've learned so much over these years, and made a difference in so many lives, some of which I would never have known if it wasn't for this disease.

I've made it through one decade, maybe two, or maybe even less. Science makes steps forward all the time, and who's to know what the future holds? Everyday is one step closer to a cure, so I plan to keep moving, step by step, day by day. And finally

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So on a more personal level with you guys, that's for sure, but together we can beat it. This is coming from someone who's had A1C's from 6 to 12. Surround yourself with those who care for you, and never, NEVER, make the mistake of thinking you're alone in this world. Asking for help isn't a sign of weakness, it's a sign of wisdom; to recognize when something is bigger than just you alone. And remember, or just to vent. We've all been there at some point.

So, you can do it. And to those who have had it longer, I salute you. Let's keep on fighting this battle until our fingers bleed no more.

Already I am sick of this question:

""Is it Type 1 or 2?""

I feel they are only asking in order to pass judgement

**(edit: in Australia most people know there is type 1 and 2. Basically Type 1 = not your fault


But it isn't

""How is he handling it?""

Until yesterday I was honest and answered ""Not well

But the majority of time the next thing they say is:

""Well it could be worse - at least it isn't cancer and he isn't going to die from it!""

How do you stop yourselves from punching these people?? So dismissive!

I switched off the conversation and stopped talking about diabetes but it really irks me and I feel I am getting more pissed off over it than I should be.

I've decided that from now on if anybody asks I'll only give banal answers like ""Yeah he is doing okay."" or ""We'll get used to it."" 

My husband spoke to his diabetes educator about this and also about how he feels bad that he feels sorry for himself, with diabetes there is no relief, ever.

I call the front desk and tell them their 'fridge' has frozen my life-saving medication. Meanwhile, every single freaking pharmacy is closed until 9am.

A common problem for me in my early days was buying Snickers' and keeping them in the fridge for when I had a hypo. I'd almost always eat them within a couple of days and when I had a hypo I'd have to have coffee or simply eat/drink sugar
Instead, with sugar, will save you the temptation. For me it's [dextrose tablets](http://www.chemistdirect.co.uk/dextro-energy-tablets-tropical_1_12154.html), they're extremely cheap, fast acting, and come in a few flavours. I don't particularly like the orange flavour ones, so I buy those and keep a packet in my jacket pocket, house and work. That way even if I lose my jacket



* **Seek out Novorapid or any fast acting insulin.**

Novorapid is a [fast acting insulin](http://www.diabetes.co.uk/insulin/rapid-acting-insulin.html), typically within 10 minutes, of injecting and is **excellent** when you have high blood sugar. The problem is they don't usually tell the newly diagnosed about it because it's very expensive and potentially dangerous if you keep it next to your regular insulin, it can also be abused by those who want to eat high sugar foods without immediate blood sugar consequence. If you're sensible and look after your diabetes, none of these are an issue and fast acting insulin is a valuable tool and it's worth getting a new pen every few months for when you might need it.



* **Exercise will help you a thousand times more than any diet changes

The single biggest impact I've had on my blood sugar, circulation cardiovascular and stress levels, all of which are common problems and symptoms of poorly controlled diabetes.
This is a lifestyle change and takes a bit of work and effort to set up

There are some obvious precautions to take, etc, but this really is just about finding a half hour to an hour 3 times per week and committing yourself to working out at those times every week.

Here is [The Couch Potato to 5k running program](http://www.coolrunning.com/engine/2/2_3/181.shtml) which is all you need. Finding or creating your own cardiovascular workout program will bring you leaps and bounds, resulting in stress and lethargy, both of which are now gone. 3 hours per week for me is more than enough to keep me happy and moving forward.",,False,,t5_2qhsj,,http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/vdqo1/as_a_type_1_diabetic_of_10_years_here_are_3_tips/

but seriously. due to the obvious risks involved with experiments

let me start by saying, kids are going to do the drugs. if they are mentally and physically perpared to handle their diabetes during that experience, then they will be much safer.


Now i'll start for real. 

**Weed** - this is a simple one and yet because of a lack of information i went through a tough time in my early years. most importantly, dizziness). i have on many occasions freaked out and chugged juice and then tested my blood sugar and it was not low at all. but big deal! it was the safer choice. 
when i first started smoking, i remind myself that i'm safe and i will feel fine in 3 or 4 minutes.

- always check blood before smoking. its just good to know where you're starting at. 
- be weary of the munchies! obviously being high (sugar) is safer than being low. but often times in a blazed-stupor i lose complete track of how many chips i've really eaten


enough about weed! just be smart - its not really much different than real life.^(its just a lot more fun.)



**ACID**

ok. i was diagnosed at 13 and by age 16 i became very curious about psychedelics. i would read articles and articles in encyclopedias/scientific journals/anecdotes/biographies about the effects of psychedelics. i found it to be profoundly interesting regarding the nature of consciousness. however, and my paranoia i frequently experienced with weed at the time, i thought it was a recipe for disaster. *Fast Forward to college* after i became a regular Toker, and overcame my weed paranoia, and additionally had much more experience hanging out around people who were doing acid, i became slightly more open to the idea. last summer i went camping at a music festival with a kid who, it turns out

this finally gave me the confidence to try acid for the first time and i did so. Here are some things diabetics should know about acid

- it also does not directly affect blood sugar
- taking 1 tab of acid will usually NOT result in visual hallucinations. instead it will likely be closer to an 8-hour adrenaline rush and copious amount of enthusiasm for everything. i highly recommend 1 tab for a first time.
- your attitude towards the trip and the situation you place yourself in (you ""set and setting"") largely determines the results of your trip. I.E. **If you are nervous about tripping with diabetes
- acid will not impair your understanding of your surroundings. for some reason i had this idea that i might not totally comprehend my glucometer or what my blood sugar meant. *this is ridiculous*. i was 100% able to check my blood sugar and respond accordingly. luckily

- make sure you have generous amounts of juice etc readily available. not because you have al likelihood of going low


these are the only two drugs i have done. i plan to do shrooms over the next month or so


please share your experiences with everyone!

EDIT - **Alcohol** because some people brought it up in responses (and rightly so). alcohol is by far the worst drug for diabetics save maybe your classic hard-ass drugs. **alcohol is sigificantly less safe than weed or psychedelics!** in the long-term, when you pass out low, your friends might just assume you were drunk and pay no mind.",,False,,t5_2qhsj,,http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/umnwn/lets_talk_about_drugs_baby/

Even with an a1c of 5.5 (which I maintained for the remainder of the pregnancy)

With dedication to checking my blood sugars, my pregnancy turned out to be actually fairly easy. 

The reward? A perfectly healthy baby boy who I am absolutely in love with. He was 6 lbs 3 ounces (so not large at all). His blood sugars needed to be checked for the first 12 hours of his life and were all normal. He was healthy in absolutely every way and we got to leave the hospital earlier than anyone anticipated because we were both doing so well.

1326212194.0,oay2w,I participated in a clinical trial for a Type 1 Diabetes treatment AMA,mwilliams,39,6,17,"I submitted the below 5 months ago

----

At 25 I was diagnosed a Type 2 diabetic.  However

The study was called [DEFEND](http://www.wtvq.com/health/981-defend-diabetes-trial).

&gt; DEFEND is a Phase III clinical trial looking at a drug, Lead Investigator at the Joslin Diabetes Center/University of Maryland, says the drug is given through a half-hour intravenous infusion over 8 consecutive days. Otelixizumab is designed to target and attack the immune cells that are inappropriately killing the islet cells. Hopefully, that will preserve the body’s ability to make some of its own insulin and extend the honeymoon period after diagnosis.

I was required to sign a boat load of paperwork and do a series of blood work to ensure I had enough islet cells kicking around so the drug could hopefully prevent them from dying off.

Once it came time for dosing, so it was nice to have an office available.  It lasted 8 days, and the dosing took roughly 4 hours.  They put me on a very slow drip IV, sat me in a comfy chair and gave me privacy.  I was able to work from the site, otherwise they had a nice HDTV and video games or whatever to occupy your time.

They provided some meds to take each morning to throttle back my immune system a bit as well as to prevent the symptoms I might get from the drug (flu like I was told).  

Once the dosing completed I was free to go for the rest of the day.  

After the 8 day period I had to return monthly for blood work.  Every third (I think) blood work was a more involved one where I drank a special breakfast shake and they drew blood every 30 minutes over a 4 hour period.  Otherwise they would draw a few tubes and I could be on my way.

Throughout the trial I was also provided a PDA (a Palm Pilot with their software on it) and a meter with test strips.  I had to test at least 4 times a day and the meter transferred the numbers to the PDA which got sent nightly to the study (via a dock that had a cell phone connection).  They provided me all the strips and lancets I needed (huge perk!).

It has been 3 years since I finished the trial and I recently had to leave it (I moved and there aren't any locations nearby which can do the blood work).  There was a 1 in 3 chance I was going to get the placebo and they notified me upon my departure that I did indeed get the placebo.  The nurse I worked with and myself suspected I did.  I felt like a champ throughout the dosing period.

I believe I was paid roughly ~$2500 throughout the span of the trial.  And that doesn't factor in free test strips and lancets for 3 years.  

There has been some success with the trial

Needless to say it was interesting to participate and the perks of getting free strips and lancets was nice! (I have great insurance

I  own a heart rate monitor and will be testing this functionality by working out my resting baseline and also recording the increase in my heart rate during a controlled hypoglycemic episode.

1337883922.0,u34js,Introducing the June 2012 r/Diabetes Challenge (v2.0)- A Collective Effort Towards Better Diabetes Care!,Sippin_Haterade,36,4,34,"Hello everyone!

It's finally time for another r/Diabetes Challenge. This will be the second r/diabetes challenge held on the subreddit so far

So what is the r/Diabetes Challenge? The r/Diabetes Challenge is a challenge for members of the subreddit to make a conscious effort geared towards better diabetes care. It's the same idea as a group of friends encouraging each other to lose some weight

I would just kindly ask all those who are participating to [**please fill out the anonymous survey**](http://redditdiabetes.polldaddy.com/s/r-diabetes-challenge-june-2012) so we can track results. All information is confidential

If you want to see the results of the last challenge

----

**Goals for the Challenge**

* At least one person experiences an overall improvement in glucose levels.
* Participants as a whole experience better glucose control during this period.
* That participants continue any positive habits after the challenge.

----

**What's New This Challenge**

*Questions of the Day*

We will be posting questions that will hopefully spur discussions regarding diabetes management every few days. Some of the questions will be open ended

*""Challenge Buddies"" (optional)*

A few of you suggested that we pair people together so they can encourage and motivate each other throughout the challenge. This could help people stay focused and on course with developing new habits, of course, optional, and there will be etiquette set in place for participants to follow (see details below).

----

**How the Challenge Will Work**

* First

* Participants will [fill out an anonymous survey](http://redditdiabetes.polldaddy.com/s/r-diabetes-challenge-june-2012) before and after the challenge. If you are a lurker

* If you are interested in being part of the buddy system then make sure you provide your username in the survey

* As of now, and the challenge will finish at the end of the month.

* Those that are participating in the challenge can issue themselves [purple flair](http://i.imgur.com/vqcg5.png) (look on the sidebar).

* At the end of the month

* I will post a breakdown of the data to show any changes in average glucose levels of the subreddit

* If you feel stuck at any point, or join the [IRC chat room](http://bit.ly/wubCAs) (where there are many kind diabetics who are helpful, supportive, and free of judgement.)

----

**Challenge Buddy Etiquette**

*Do:*

* Provide a brief introduction of yourself- how long you've been diagnosed

* Be kind

* Try to connect with your buddy every 3-5 days- preferably every 3

* Try to be there for your buddy. This is a two way street. If your buddy is trying to help you out

*Don't:*

* Judge your buddy. This is a judge-free relationship.

* Ask for information that's not relevant to diabetes. Respect your buddy's wishes to stay as anonymous as possible (unless your buddy shares this information without you asking)

* Be rude

----

**Some Things To Consider**

These are a few minor changes in care that have great marginal benefit:

* Check your sugar at least 3-5 times a day.

* Check your sugar before eating meals.

* If on insulin

* Check your sugar at your peak after every meal or snack. That is probably about an hour after the last bite.

* Use that result

* If on insulin or an insulin-stimulating med

* Be diligent and proactive with your medication.

* Make more of a conscious effort to count carbs.

* Try not to beat yourself up and dwell on high readings or bad control

* Be open to include more exercise/healthy lifestyle choices during this time period.

* Try to get in at least half an hour of exercise or vigorous physical activity daily.

I just feel the need to vent


Today I went to my endo for my usual check up and to get my A1c. Turns out my usual endo wasn't there and there was another endocrinologist instead. I had an appointment at 9:00, I tell him my basal units (18u in the morning and 22u at night) all ok, then he asks me how much do I bolus for lunch, I told him there isn't a specific unit I have as it depends on how many carbs I am eating in that meal.


He looked at me as if I were insane.


I explained to him I have 1u of bolus per 5g of carbs (I know, said that what I am doing is illogical and what I am doing makes no sense and where is the science in it. Almost fell on the floor. He told me I need to bolus per ration, if I were to have 1 slice of pizza I would need to have 5-6 units of bolus. I explained to him that the pizza slice may vary, it can come from a rozen pack, it can come from pizza hut, it can come from wherever and they will all most likely have a very different carb content and the system he is suggesting will not work. He then claimed 1 cup of yogurt I should bolus 2 units...once again I asked which kind of yogurt? Activia has 13g of carbs, greek yogurt has 4g etc. He didn't seem to catch on at all about anything I was sayying and refused to listen to me at all. I asked to be switched to Lantus, even once trippled it and fasted the whole day and not once did I get within goal range with Lemevir, I explained I would look at the carb content of the package the sliced sandwhich bread comes in or any other ingredient and calculate my bolus. He insulted me and called me crazy. The nurses had no idea what I was on about either and said it's all done by portions and he is a very respectable endocrinologist. That this is not the way to do it and I need to speak to one of the nurses about my insulin dosages and meals...to strictly listen to what the endocrinologist says (lol no).


He didn't check my eyes
Every single thing I said he dismissed it


Am I exagerating? Am I being a bit arrogant over this and may he be right about some of it?

I became a diabetic at the age of 16 and it was devastating to me.  I immediately came to the conclusion that I was never going to be able to do much of anything from that day forward. That was until my brother gave me a piece of scrap paper with a few names jotted on it.

On that scrap of paper he had listed the names of several successful

6 years later and I’m a healthy

1373472093.0,1i0ixz,[Story Time] Passed out from a Hypo during a music festival.,oh_bother,29,3,39,"Alright

Over this past weekend I was at a music festival in Maryland and had quite a scary hypo event. Full on pass-out, frustrating wake up period. Let's not get ahead of ourselves though, the festival involves a few thousand people at a campground, partying all night, revelry, the usual sort.  Generally I am on staff in this event, this would be my first year as a ""citizen"" so to speak

The first day was all camp setup, supplies etc, and hung out with everybody as they trickled in. The weather was brutal: 90 - 100 degrees, very little wind, maximum humidity. This poses a unique problem for me as I tend to easily sweat off all of my gear. I was in the habit of periodically pressing on my pump site and CGM transmitter to make sure they were there, and to potentially re-stick if either had been threatening to peel off. 

I usually put a sheet of Opsite Flexfix over the CGM site

I returned to camp, and overbolused for it all. This typically isn't a huge deal, I have a massive insulin resistance, so even with a large bolus like that, the corn alone would be enough to lessen the blow of the insulin. Or so I had thought. 

Immediately after calibration I was super hyperglycemic

Oh, and I am not sugar coating or anything I was really not drinking much since I loathe day drinking and I knew it wouldn't help me  hydrate in that heat. 

The next thing I recall is more of a sequence, and when. If I wanted to spend more time writing this I could frame it as I saw things happening and try to convey the confusion but I am writing quickly so let's just jump into what was going on. 

The sun had set, but not 10 mins after that my blood sugar crashed harder and faster than I had ever seen in my entire 20 years as a diabetic. Straight down. In the course of 40ish minutes I went from extremely high (400) to extremely low (LOW). I didn't make it three steps from the tent, I must have keeled over onto the grass just outside of it. 

My tent was off the beaten path very slightly, and couldn't be arsed to lift a dainty finger in aid of my sugar situation. This is where things got weird. Several hours in the ""LOW"" range of the CGM pass, and about 4am I start to come to. 

At first, (so I thought) so it didn't really even matter. I knew I was lying in grass, and thought I was dreaming of being in a huge dark misty field. I had no idea I was at a festival. Some weird dreams go on, I think something about riding an art car or standing on one... Then there was one tree, in the middle of this flat empty grassy misty field...  so here I was in this dream (that wasn't a dream) unable to really do anything but move my head a bit, completely confused. The gravity of the situation started to sink in. I didn't make the connection to sugar at first but I started to see some lights and some shapes, people walking by (we were near a main path). I thought if I could get the attention of those people I could get help. The problem was that I didn't have enough sugar to properly move my muscles, but I knew I had to get there first. ""Oh yeah, fun times. I imagined how easy it would be to sit up cross-legged, I need to get help from the brighter people"".... Still I tried to just

This was probably the most beautiful silhouette I've ever seen, they got medical to swoop in with a golf cart and whisk me away to the nurse station. 

As I said before, they could have given me a logic puzzle and I would have solved it, I just couldn't pilot ME to respond. I said CGM a lot hoping they'd look at the damn thing, but the staff nurse said she had no idea what a CGN was. 

The rest of the story is pretty boring, and the dirt on my face from when I keeled over. 

I owe that medical staff everything

I also plan on taking the girl who found me out to dinner. Also because she is cute.

Is there a lesson? This isn't a morality tale (far from it) shit happens. I'm going to pay closer attention to my CGM, huge bolus at 3pm... nearly 400 at 7pm to... I don't even know -20? In a span of 40 mins (i'll fact check that when I pull the logs). I've never in my life dropped that fast and I am very sensitive to lows.

I'm in my 20s and try to be pretty active on the dating scene. With that in mind

Well, and she was (seemingly) very into it until I took my shirt off and revealed the pump site/tubing and the Dexcom's big ass sensor and site dressing covering a sizable amount of my left abdomen.  She asked what it was, a natural response, and I tried to tell her very quickly and act extremely nonchalant in explaining it and diabetes.  After that, her mood turned and she was all of a sudden very UN-interested in furthering things.  We ended up just going to sleep without anything happening and now she won't return my calls/texts and told me this morning that she ""just isn't wanting to date anyone right now"" which obviously isn't true because she wouldn't have gone out with me in the first place had that been the case.  

Anyways, but it seemed like a done deal until she learned about my condition.  It instantly switched when she saw it.  Needless to say I'm pretty hurt by it, and I know ""anyone who doesn't love you for who you are...blah, blah"" is VERY true, but that still doesn't make it feel any better.

I woke up an hour later feeling kinda low, so I scarfed them down as fast as I could.  On my way back to the couch, I fell over and couldn't move off the floor.

Obviously, but all day today I've been thinking about it and crying about how upset I am over this experience (not acceptable behavior for a 20s male).  Easily my worst low ever, and that's with several years of Type 1.

I'm very happy to see such a positive response with the survey and [the r/Diabetes Challenge](http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/p5i7y/introducing_the_rdiabetes_challenge_a_collective/) that will be taking place the next 3 weeks. So far we have 112 participants from a total of 14 different countries! It's always awesome to see people from various parts of the world who have never met uniting for a cause

I am making this post as a simple reminder that **tomorrow, so bring your A game!**. I know some of you have started a little early and that's totally fine- we needed to have a week window for more people to read about the challenge. Remember, by filling out the survey and saying yes to participating in the challenge, **we have all promised ourselves to make a conscious effort towards better control of our diabetes**. I hope everyone tries their best to fulfill this promise, especially since I believe that any difficulties faced during the challenge will be small compared to the awesomeness of experiencing better glucose levels.

Best wishes to all

I was diagnosed with Type 1 when I was 7. After being diagnosed I wasn't sad or angry or anything. All I remember was that I had been feeling bad for a long time and now in hospital getting injections I was feeling a million dollars.

In the next few years I kept good control over it. Multiple injections a day, maybe 4 years after diagnosis. Animas IR1200 (since upgraded to the IR1250 and now 2020). Diabetes control got tighter.

Problems started about 3-4 years ago. Started getting seriously sick of having to deal with it. Stopped using a record book. Got lazy with carb-counting. It was easy to do this with a pump

I figured out if I ever wanted a day of school I could purposely make my BG high in the morning by disconnecting my pump in the evening. I did this far too often. I lied to my doctors every checkup

**Where I'm at today:** Frankly, second day off this week. My control at the moment is shocking. My docs would probably be in shock if I was actually honest with how I've been handling it. My basal rates are outdated. My insulin-carb ratio and insulin sensitivity factor are even more out of date, I just go by semi-educated guesses of how much I think I should take. Somehow my HbA1c's aren't shocking, they suggest that it's mostly under control. I would assume that's because of some extreme lows cancelling out the highs so overall it looks right, but in reality everything is yoyoing all the time.

I feel tired all the time

**What I want:** I know how bad my control has been lately

* There's no motivation if I feel like shit
* All my good diabetes control habits I once had I have lost
* My basal/bolus rates are so out of date
* I sure as hell don't want to front up to my docs about how terrible my control has been. That would mean fronting up to my family as well
* I can't front up to my family about years of lying. That's just not going to happen

I don't even know why I'm posting here or what I want to get out of it. Just wanted to say this somewhere and I have nowhere else for that. If anybody has advice or help that would be great too. I don't know.

Today I had my one-year checkup.

My average blood glucose for the past six months (including after meals, my average is 121mg/dl - mostly due to me chugging a couple large glasses of what I was *assured* was 'diet coke', and then when I tested it with a diastix was pure sugar... That resulted in a few hours of 300mg/dl and major headaches and shakes, so I tested hourly until I came down).

My A1C is 6.0%

And my cholesterol is 'perfect' according to my doctor.

I lost about 20 pounds in the first two months.  (I could stand to lose another 50).

This was done primarily through lifestyle changes and major changes to diet.  I have eaten more bacon in the last year than I have in the past decade, and with 15g of carbs in a serving I can handle it.  I do allow myself one 'go slightly crazy' day a week where I'll suck up the high and allow bread with dinner or if I am feeling REALLY saucy some sushi.

1357753655.0,169bvr,T2 UPDATE A1C Reduction,bi-fornicated,22,2,10,"Well it has been just over a month since I was freaking out about the possibility of losing my job due to a high A1C. [Original Post] (http://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/13y7tg/t2my_a1c_is_at_81eac_186_need_to_reduce_to_below/) In that time I have been doing a **[3/3/3 keto diet] (http://www.ncl.ac.uk/magres/assets/documents/StudyRecipes.pdf)** 3 Glucose Control Shakes (I used Nestles Boost Glucose Control because I could not find the one listed) / 3+ Liters of water / 3 servings of vegetables.   I also have added a diabetic multivitamin once a day

* I have gone from 261lbs to 225lbs (36lbs of weight loss)
* My Blood Sugar has gone down from 365avg to 119avg.
* My A1C from 8.1 to 6.6

All in all I feel much better; I have more energy and am less tired in the afternoons.  I am sticking with the diet for now as at this point real food makes me too full.  I do “cheat” now and again by having some lean meat for dinner and or a low carb snack.  My boss is very impressed with my dedication to this diet and reducing my A1C.  It looks like I’ll get to deploy in the next few months!

**TL:DR** Not Fired

**EDIT 1**

Thanks for all the support!

Here are a few answers...

The shakes are just low sugar/carb protein shakes, can have a drastic effect on the amount of hunger you get and when you get it.

* Wake up and take 500mg metformin
* I have my first shake between 0600-0730
* I drink lots of coffee
* Second shake around 1200 plus or minus 30 minutes
* One liter of water between 1130 and 1500
* Second liter from 1500 to about 2200
* Dinner is either my third shake and a salad or a lean piece of chicken or fish and a salad (I do my veggie servings all at once) 


**Build in cheats!**
* Work hard to go by the book the first few weeks.
* Monitor your blood sugar often.
* Allow yourself to have a treat now and then
* For me weighing myself helped a lot to boost my confidence and keep me going.
* Get an at home A1C kit every couple of weeks to see how you are doing. $20.00 at Walgreens.

Well
She trusts me. She tests and gives insulin when I am around.
I am also the only one she let in on the fact that she has trouble with her sugars.

I am not completely ignorant. Her pancreas cant produce insulin on its own

I try not to be intrusive or overly aggressive

Another helpful thing I may have forgot to mention, different measuring systems are used for blood sugars.

If, it is exactly like that.

Viagra research started looking for a cardiac drug. It works by relaxing the smooth muscles of blood vessels. The vessels relax and blood flow increases. This happens in the entire body

I am a T1 and I have been taking a half a 100mg tablet of Viagra (50mg) every few days for over two years now and I don't know what I would do if I couldn't get it. I am sure it is helping with my eyes as well. My optometrist keeps looking for problems

Even if you are not noticing any numbness

Personally, I think a lot of diabetics who could prevent or at least slow the onset of neuropathy aren't doing so because they don't know of anything to do. Lyrica only treats the after effects, it does nothing to slow the progress.

Thursday last week, but as the novelty wears off, and the reality sets in, I'm left feeling like I got stuck with something I didn't want.

With shots, or toss it in my pack and go hiking, or leave it in the living room, etc. 

Now, dangling from me, every minute of the day. I can't forget it. And anybody that sees me with my shirt off (summer is coming, after all) Is going to gawk, wonder, or ask. I don't want that.

Anyway, so I've been feeling more sensitive to highs and lows. At DCoA I asked again why I couldn't use the strips for my old meter. In the interest of fairness, I will admit that I was very angry. They were telling me that the pharmacy gave me the wrong strips, which I don't care about. I was missing work to get this sorted out. I felt that they were wasting my time investigating someone's mistake.

The person at the counter told me that they received a letter back in April of 2012 indicating the old strips were no longer covered. I didn't think to ask who sent it or for a copy of the letter. I just accepted it and asked quite bluntly for any meter that works.

I told her that was inaccurate

By this point I'm pretty tired of her changing the subject. I was getting angry, but I went back.

1358773244.0,16zird,"Update -  ""My T1 son's about to go on a pump - any advice or pointers?""",sho19132,22,2,14,"We had our training on Saturday

The morning actually started out with a bit of a snafu - we had arranged a time to meet with the diabetes educator

Once we got back home, but at this point we don't want him operating too much himself - the educator told us about one patient who they had to take off the pump, because he figured out how to open it and started giving himself extra insulin whenever he wanted a sweet snack before dinner.)

I won’t go over all the details of the training here – if you have a pump you know how it works

As part of the training

It was a bit traumatic when it actually came time to do his insertion.  He was excited about the pump, but I took quite a few saline shots when we were getting my son used to his insulin this summer).  

He wouldn’t hold still for the insertion, but I think it was more mental than physical – he forgot about it as soon as I whipped out a new Skylander toy for his being so brave.  He and his brother went back to playing video games, and ten minutes after we did it he just shrugged when I asked if it still hurt.

The night after we started the pump was a little rough.  We had to keep track of him through the night, because we’ve always managed to keep a very tight rein on his numbers.  

After calling the diabetes clinic’s after-hours number around 1 a.m.

The new insertion seemed to fix things.  He was still a little high the following morning

He had ok numbers throughout the day – a little higher than normal

Once the trauma of the first insertion was over

They ran into a couple of kids from his school, he likes to pretend he didn’t even notice it – he’ll say “Dad, when’re you going to do it?  I have stuff to do!”)  Of course, I’m probably going to need to have another Skylander hidden away for when we do the next insertion on Tuesday, just in case.

The first night of pumping was a bit tough for us

All the built in features of the pump are going to make things a bit easier to manage – this is going to let my guy live a bit more like he did before he was diagnosed last summer.  (I’m actually kind of worried it might make things too easy for him – I’ve reminded him a few times that even though we don’t need to give him shots

One thing we don't care for is the built-in meter - we love the fact that it sends the BG to the pump, and it seems to need a little more blood - we've errored out several of the strips because we didn't use enough.  Other than that, though, so far we are very happy with the Animas pump.

These videos will give you the basics of the psychology behind what you are trying to do.  You are ‘shaping’ your dog’s behavior, this is what you want to avoid.

[Classical Conditioning]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ3dLm2j5uk)

[Operant Conditioning]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B8vIbuoktew)

[Shaping]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCUWHP4YDgU)

First of all NEVER use punishments. Ever.  Reward wanted behavior, think like a dog.  How do dogs think? Dogs think like children.  They make simple associations, but do not abstractly make complex associations. (Or maybe they do, but for our intents and purposes assume they have the intelligence level of a child.)  Always wait until he has each step down nearly perfectly before moving on.  Patience and consistency are your allies.

[Intro Video]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nNLJ6OP4Z1A)

[Overview of DAD training]( http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdOJ6PxehZE)

[**Clicker Training**](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15vKqCSNhqY)

Clicker training is beneficial for 2 reasons.  Once the dog associates the click with reward
 
Clicker training is simple.  Click, and do not give the treat before the click as this will confuse the dog.   Consistency is key for all aspects of the training, especially this part.  Do the ‘click, treat’ multiple times in a row in a ‘session’ (like in the video), but also randomly throughout the day.  Once the dog is clicker trained you do not have to follow every click with a treat, but be sure to follow clicks with treats every now and then to maintain the ‘click means reward’ association.

**Picking a Cue**

This part is your preference, like a dog toy or a tester kit, just be sure to never let him otherwise use these objects.  If it is a toy, the only time he touches it is when you are training him or he is alerting you.  If it is a blood testing kit, it is an extra one for the sole purpose of him bringing it to you, do not use it daily as your blood testing kit.

**Blood Sugar Scent**

The dogs pick up on the scent we emit when our blood sugar is low/high.  To capture this scent get some clean rags or dishtowels and wait until your sugars are low/high and rub the rags all over your body

**Associating Scent Rag with Reward**

Next put one of the rags out somewhere around your house somewhere.  This part is a waiting game.  Once the dog shows interest in the rag, click means reward”.  After he gets good at realizing “hey that scent rag is out, if I go smell it I get rewarded” start hiding the scent rag and reward him when he finds it.  This will make him realize he needs to go looking for this scent and it may not be out in an obvious place.  Once he has this association down move on to his cue.

**Associating Scent Rag with Cue**

This will probably be the hardest part.  Continuing the same method as before, and then reward him.  In his mind he will be thinking along the lines of “Hey! I found the rag, man, where’s my reward?” (He will be confused, but this is good.) then he moves towards my arm, BAM, reward.   Then wait until he gets closer and closer to the cue.  Eventually he will be all up on my arm, licking the tattoo means reward.” Once he has that association down you have a dog that will alert you when your blood sugars low.  Be sure to continue rewarding him when he correctly alerts you to a low blood sugar to avoid ‘extinction’.

Edit to add:  So, and started taking Metformin to treat that. It didn't help much, my blood sugar remained consistently borderline, and I went off and on the medicine over the years, depending on if I had insurance and could see a doctor. About a year ago, I finally got solid health insurance, and went to see an Endo for help with concieving. She diagnosed me with Hypothyroidism, and put me back on Mteformin. Because I wasn't ""diabetic enough"", because

I eat betweeen 1300 and 1500 calories a day, no more than 180 carbs per day, with 45-60 carbs per meal.

My little girl has been fuss free at night since about 3 months of age. I've been working late the last week or so. Getting home about 11:30 or midnight each night the begning of this week my wife had told me that the baby was uncharacteristically crying for several hours unable to get to sleep. On wednesday

My wife and I were in a total state of déjà vu at this point. We got a bed right away... the same one we were in when they told us they were calling a helo transport team. We even joked that this room was a bad omen when we first got there... They took her vitals and some blood and in pretty short order the doctor comes in and said they had some ""interesting"" results from the blood test. When I think back to this scene from just a few days ago this is the point where things get fuzzy. To say this came out of left field would be an understatement.  I would have been caught less off guard if the stig came screaming in on a  zamboni from said field. Suddenly all I percieve is the doctor explaining to us that her her white cell count is elevated which was expected if she's got some sort of infection. However, they bring the small tester for a bedside check. This one read 500... again, this may have been as high as that particular machine could go up to. Any hopes that the lab might have been wrong are almost completely gone, though I still had some irrational hope that this machine was also malfunctioning somehow. At this point the doctor says she's sending us back to the PICU we went to before via ambo this time. We decided that my wife would ride with our girl while I ran home to get a bag. Kind of in shock and very much in denial, I floated out of the ER with phone in hand trying to see if these symptoms can possibly mean anything else.... I don't know what the hell I was expecting to find. Short of an article

The last few days have  been kind of surreal, how much our lives have changed in just the last couple of days. We spent only one night in the PICU and got transfered to a less critical peds floor the next day. Our stay here has been as much about education for us as much as fine-tuning a regimine for our little girl. I often talk with my wife about her work. Over the years I've kind of absorbed a lot of information about nursing. Enough so that there hasn't been any terminology or concepts that completely went completely over my head. I understand the role of insulin, how DKA develops when there's not enough, what happens if too much is administered and what can we do to address the situation... still, I'm terrified. My wife works nights, so at some point I'm not going to have her there at night to make sure I don't royally fuck something up.

Apparently this diagnosis is rare for someone her age. It's rare enough in any event that none of the protocols they have in place are geared towards someone her age or size. We're in the unit that specializes with diabetic children, I'll probably find your posts about it in short order, but if you were to post resources you've found helpful to the comments here, I wouldn't hate that.

I've spent the last couple of nights reading up on diabetes. I've not been on reddit for very long and it was only just now that it occured to me to see if there was a diabetes subreddit.

People occasionally pose questions about the cost for diabetes care

For anyone trying to calculate his or her own expenses, and those of you in civilized countries might find it interesting to see what someone in the USA has to spend to treat T-1 diabetes.

A bit of information about my insurance coverage – 

I get insurance through my employer - it is a self-insured plan administered by an insurance company acting as a third-party-administrator.

My prescription coverage has three tiers for copayments based on whether a drug is generic or name-brand and whether the plan considers it to be “preferred”: $15, one at school, one at after-school care, and one in the bag he carries with him.  My son also has problems with car-sickness, so we also always keep Zofran on hand.  The generic version of the drug is cheaper than the required copay so we pay a lower amount for it (it’s usually about $10 for a refill).

My medical coverage also has different levels of copayments, and for that we have a 20 percent coinsurance payment as long as we go to an in-network provider.

My plan has an annual $2,000 out-of-pocket limit with the cost of his hospital stay, so his pump and CMG were covered at 100 percent because we got them before the end of the year.  (If we had waited until the next year, it would have cost us $2,000 for those two things - we would have paid the out-of-pocket max again.)  His testing strips and his pump and CGM supplies were also covered at 100 percent until the end of that first year.

I’m posting this under a throw-away account

If you think the list below is missing anything I should have included,500 into my flexible health spending account – with the additional medical expenses I and the rest of my family will probably have, I’m sure I’ll use it all.)

I was diagnosed at 8 years old, because nothing is ever going to happen to you because you're indestructible, so you just stop taking insulin for snacks or meals. I got over that after graduation and did okay during my first two years of college. Then I moved out of my parent's house and lost a lot of support from people that I know. So I got lazy. It's not that I want to reject the fact that I have diabetes now, it's just that I don't care, I guess.

So I went to a new endo yesterday (change of insurance, ""I know, it's really bad and I just don't know what to do to fix it."" He suggested that I go back to the basics. Back to when I was first diagnosed, and had a regimented meal schedule, and looked at nutrition labels to get carb counts.

I can't believe no one had ever thought of this before. It's so genius. In the past my endo had suggested, but for me, I have to go big or go home. If it doesn't change everything, I'm just going to slip back into my bad habits. I'm starting my new plan tomorrow and I have a really good feeling about it!

Up until now I have been really turned off by the constant visible reminder of my diabetes but it seems that the potential health benefits may outweigh those issues now. I do have a few question first though.

1. Sex. My boyfriend is very supportive and helpful with my diabetes and would never tell me that I am not beautiful because of a pump but I am just concerned that it would make me feel less sexy. I don't want it to be an unspoken turn off for both of us. How do you ladies with a pump deal with this?

2. Bathing suits and swimming. I love to go to the pool for both lap swimming and just lounging and having fun. Now that it's summer time and all the bikinis are out what's the best way to handle a day at the pool? Can the pump be in the sun for that long (I know my pens can't get too hot or they don't work as well)? Also lap swimming

3. Just the general constant physical reminder of your diabetes. I have pretty good control now (hba1c 6.4) but I would love for it to be lower (hence the pump questions) but I also love just being able to be a regular person to most people and not constantly fielding questions about it.

One way of thinking about it is this: Being diabetic is like running a 50 mile race. It's the same race as everybody else
 

The problem is that the bag isn’t always 50kg. Sometimes it’s only 10kg, and grow heavier as you run, making it harder to keep going. And whilst you can carry 100kg on your shoulders for a short time, after a bit you will struggle and need to stop.
 

No one else can carry the back pack for you, when the bag is heavy you don’t want to complain; no one else can feel it, no one can take this bag off you, so they will not know how you feel. And the back pack is heavy a lot. If you were to complain every time life got difficult you would never get a break. So you suck it up, and make the effort to keep up and look like it’s not a heavy load; even when you’re struggling to keep walking under the weight. 
 

Sometimes people expect you to run just as hard and fast as everybody else. This happens even when they can see the backpack, and don’t understand why you ask to slow down a bit.
 

A lot of the time that back-pack is just an extra load to carry, which is why it's so important to have support out there to help us back on our feet if we fall down. ",,False,,t5_2qhsj,False,,

Well, my A1C is 6.9, the first time it's ever been in the 6's! What's most encouraging to me is that I've been taking care of myself consistently for 6 months, that's the longest I've ever gone. And I don't feel myself slowing down, yet!

We haven’t met with an endocrinologist or dietician yet.  As soon as we left the doctor’s office, but I know we can’t wait that long to do anything!  She said that if his doctor called they might be able to get him in sooner.  I spoke to his doctor yesterday evening – he is going to call the endocrinologist’s office this morning to see when we can get him in.

It’s weird, and so it wouldn’t be a big thing for my son.  But this morning it is really starting to kick in that in one very big way my son’s life is going to be different from anything I had expected for him.  This is going to be something he lives with – we’re not going to have any more of our Saturday morning donut store trips, we’ll have to carry the blood testing device when we travel and figure out where we can keep his insulin on long trips, he’s going to have to take shots everyday for the rest of his life.  This is the kid I have to hold down every time a nurse gives him a vaccination.  This is the kid who screamed like he was being murdered when his doctor pricked his finger for a blood draw a few years ago.

 A few hours ago after our doctor called us back.  (It's screwed up how the endocrinologists we've been referred to take patients - apparently they require new patients to be admitted to an emergency room before they will see them.)

1372907017.0,1hm05t,Helping Diabetic Boyfriend,cuddles_mcfluffy,19,2,17,"My boyfriend goes through spells where he takes great care of himself, so he's had a few years of practice but unfortunately missed out on the typical parent caretaking that most type 1's learn from. 

Due to bare bones insurance (and apathy on his part), and terrible care. We weren't dating when he was first diagnosed, so I don't know all the details, but at one point a doctor told him ""oh, well, check once or twice a day and as long as your sugars are below 250 it's not a big deal"". Combined with a typical southern diet and college student apathy towards long-term health, his diabetes was very poorly controlled for many years. Because he's not a new diabetic

We've been dating 3 years, and slowly prodding him along towards change. He finally saw a good endocrinologist in January, switched from syringes to insulin pens which made a HUGE difference. He was super happy, the pens were a new toy, and he was very good about checking sugars and injecting insulin for meals. That went on for about 2 months and his A1C was fantastically better, then he seemingly went ""oh, all better now! Yay, he stopped checking before meals, got back on the right track for a bit

I'm stuck. I force him to do anything, never met any of his grandchildren. I know that diabetes care, even the basics my boyfriend has, is a world of difference from the olden days, but he is setting himself up for very serious consequences in the future. Every time he starts to settle into a good routine, he slides backwards. 

I know it's easy for me to tell him what to do; I'm not the one pricking my finger constantly or giving multiple shots. But I do try to eat the same diet as him, exercise with him, ect. I've even tried bribing him with um...special favors. But if I push too hard, he (understandably) gets annoyed and feels smothered. He just doesn't see diabetes as a big problem. 

Currently I handle meals and snacks at home (I enjoy cooking, help when I notice he's low (I carry juice boxes in my purse...certainly doesn't help the feeling that I've become his mother), sometimes make a suggestion at meals out, and try to take supportive but not overbearing role. But part of me wants to just smack him, take complete control over his food, insulin, doctor appointments, ect. until he snaps out of this. We live in the deep south (America)

What's a good middle ground?

I have never been a good diabetic. When I was young I would sneak candy and bad food all the time. I even got creative...I would stick a spoon in peanut butter and then dip it in refined sugar. Yeh. Judge me because it is justified. Getting caught was somewhat common

Fast forward 25 years. I am now 28. Relatively healthy. I exercise and eat nutritiously...most of the time. My fiance is a big help especially with the food/diet aspect. I stay away from carbs as much as possible. I don't really drink diet sodas (although

However, I have other bad habits and lack of good habits. 

I never test my blood sugar. I have an insulin pump and I just bolus random numbers. My a1c isn't good

I will go to an appointment with an endocrinologist. Lie about my numbers to the extent that I will even fabricate a spreadsheet of made-up numbers and tell them my glucose monitor is in the car or some other BS. I will leave the appointment determined to do better. That ambition will last for about a week and then the ""f*** it"" mentality takes over. My fiance has tried to help, but as soon as she is away or whatever, I usually cheat...a lot.

I know, blah. I don't mean to sound insensitive, but I have heard all of this before x1000. I recall when I was a child that my father took me to a grave where a family member died because she did not take care of her diabetes. It had very little impact on me. It could be because he (father) developed diabetes, too from not taking care of himself, so I just see him as a hypocrite.

* Not here to sell pumps - I'm here to spread some knowledge/information =)
* Not here to troubleshoot pumps - if you're having problems please contact your associated help line
* Not violate EU and FDA marketing regulations - if I feel like your question would do so I'll do my best to answer it
*Not violate company policies and divulge IP - I kind of like my job

Things I'm here to do:

* Answer general technology questions
* Answer questions about the current and future technology pathways of pumps specifically (we can delve into other tech aspects of diabetes care and treatment
* Where the industry (Insulin delivery and CGM) and research is heading
* Where diabetes treatment is heading in the near and long term future (MDI v pumping v closed loop v tissue engineering v genetic engineering)
* Answer any other questions I can
* To learn from you!

I've been diabetic for almost 16 years now, but I've never known (or even met) another T1 diabetic in real life.  It'd be nice to have something in common with someone so they know what I go through on a daily basis, because people who don't have it can only know so much.  I know there are a lot of others out there, but I've never known anyone else to have it, so it's pretty isolating.

What are some of you all's experience with other T1 in your peer group?  Everyone assumes that I got diabetes because I used to be fat, or old folks with T2, neither of which would suit me very well.

Also, which is true, but I've never been able to comfortably tell women that I'm T1 (I'm kinda a former/soon-to-be-former foreveralone type, but I'm overcoming it).  I sometimes feel like god is telling me not to have children, because women (and men for that matter) don't want sick children, but I would be a great father I think...

Sorry for rambling.  Any suggestions advice you guys can give me is greatly appreciated!

I'm 28 and I've been diagnosed with either t1.5 or t2 for the last 6 years. I was diagnosed while leaving the army, told to eat better, I fell off the wagon. Got mad and left it as what I thought it was. A life crippling death sentence. I was used to eating anything anytime. I loved trying all kinds of foods in excess. I was around guys who didn't have this issue all the time. I thought ""why me"" and was mad and just decided to not deal with it. Its now time to pay the piper. 
      
After letting it go for 6 years now I now have a slight issue with sight, cant get it up, and pretty much have no motivation and am a lazy piece of shit.

 I feel like me ignoring this has ruined me . My poor wife,as I cry right now while typing this, probably wont have a father for the better part of her life and deserves much more from me. I always say I'm going to take care of it, but I feel like the sugar runs my life.  I feel like its something that just makes me lazy and demoralizes me. I used to be very energetic. I had to be the Army and was for the year after I got out. After that I just got tired of feeling alone about it, no one knowing and no one caring. I felt like ""Ok live fast and die younger I guess"". I was an idiot.

Today I'm going to see one of my wife's colleagues

First off
I want to stop feeling sorry for myself. I want to blame the sugar for that. Should I? or should I seek some help or just really try to get over it. 

Is it to late for my legs? I feel like if I get a major cut/bruise or break I fear it could be it for that leg. 

Do you feel depressed when your sugar is high? 

How did you change your lifestyle?

How do people deal with starting working out after not taking care of themselves? I'm reeling with pain and soreness after a mild workout. 

I feel as almost if I'm addicted to carbs... Anyone else feel like that?

Are any of my issues red flags for something else that any of you have had?

I'm going to be asking these things to the doc today also but would really like to see what you guys have to say about it.

Thanks in advance for at least reading/commenting if you have.

What is Detective Diabetes?

Detective Diabetes is an iPad / iPhone adventure game which features a main character who has diabetes.  Throughout the course of the game the user makes decisions which, over the long term, increase or decrease the likelihood of diabetes-related complications.  The game’s scenarios are based on dozens of interviews with people who have diabetes.  

The main goals of the game are to: (1) increase empathy for people who have diabetes and (2) demonstrate that short term actions can greatly reduce the long term effects of diabetes.

The game will launch late this year or early next year. We expect the game to be downloaded and played by hundreds of thousands of people. 

The game is self-funded by the seven person team developing the game.

A few times now, he's said something to the liking of, ""ThrownOutNotAway, is your blood sugar low? You might want to check that."" Not only was this a joke based on a disability, but it was completely uncalled for and professional. 

I went to HR to report this

This guy is a complete jerk. His lack of communication skills and the hypocrisy in the work place has caused my blood sugar to go crazy. One day my blood sugar will be low

My bf has had type 1 since he was 6 years old

I have told him what to do if I have an asthma attack and I'd like to know similar about his diabetes.  He's said he rarely gets bad but I've noticed he can get moody sometimes if he's high/low and he's pretty protective about his management and has a terribly bad sweet tooth. He sometimes has to get up during the night and gets a bit shakey.  He gets very sleepy at times during the daytime too.

I also think I should know what to do if something bad did happen as a 'just in case scenario'.  I've heard if he gets too drunk it could cause problems.  It concerns me how much chocolate and sweet things he eats too. Am I worrying necessarily?  Basically I don't want to be a nag

 I realized that I have just over 80 days until my next Dr. appointment
I thought that this would be good motivation to get myself in shape

I also realized that we haven't had a challenge here in about 9 months


* Are you lacking in BG control?
* Are you lacking in willpower to improve?
* Do you need positive reinforcement?
* Do you need a new group of friends that are diabetically aware


**The Challenge Goals**

* Better understanding of Diabetes
* Better understanding of how foods and their macros work
* Better awareness of your BGs
* Better diet/exercise and how it affects you.
* Better data tracking
* Improved communication on the subreddit


**How are we going to meet these goals?**

We need to hold each other accountable. This means sharing things like MFP Food diaries and exercise. 
I realize that not everyone has a smartphone to do live tracking
these things after the activity.

I will be sharing my MFP food and exercise diary, and yell at me for it when I've headed down a carby road.

and Just purchased ZombiesRun https://www.zombiesrungame.com/computercarl/

I also have an imgur account @ http://computercarl.imgur.com/all/ where I host my weight loss pics and some CGM data. It's this kind of sharing that I hope to use to add some friends here and get/give positive support and feedback.



I realized that 80 days is a lot
all of the goals

We already have a few people who are on board with the challenge --  SeanBateman7, I will be doing it.
So... will ***you*** join us in the effort aimed towards better diabetes care and a healthier

**Customer Service**

I want to reiterate my happiness with Tandem's customer service - I've now spoken with 4 different people (and emailed back and forth 3 of them). Each has been unbelievably helpful. They did offer in-person training but since I've been using a pump for 12yrs and I write computer software for a living I decided that I didn't need it. So far I think I made the right call. And

**Supplies**

I've ordered one refill of infusion sets and the process really couldn't have been easier - I just called up, and was done (I chose the Cleo 90, haven't received yet so I don't have a review of those). During the call they suggested three boxes but when I expressed worry about running out they immediately suggested upping it to 4 boxes. My insurance covers durable medical supplies (including the pump) at 100% so I didn't worry about the cost - this may not apply to everyone. My only complaint is that Tandem marked the shipment as requiring an in-person signature meaning someone has to be home to receive the package. After UPS attempted to deliver twice I called Tandem and asked them to put a flag on my account to never require signature for supplies - they did that without batting an eye. Once again, they were willing to bend over backwards to make me happy.

**The Pump - Basics**

The pump is great in many ways and frustrating in a few. It's smaller than my old Paradigm 722 both in thickness and length but does weigh slightly more (not enough to care, etc...

The lock screen contains the current battery charge, that was nerdy, I'm sorry)), and current insulin on board including how long it'll stay on board. If you tap the top-right corner you'll be shown a status screen including current basal rate, last bolus, current carb ratio, etc...

When entering a bolus you can enter direct units **and** BG level - it'll then calculate the correct amount of insulin based on any required correction. If you choose

Basal rates are set inside of Profiles. You can have multiple profiles to fit various activities you do (I'm a lazy, BG correction, carb correction settings, and more. You can, when setting up the profile, duplicate a period. You can also duplicate profiles which allows you to make small changes without having to re-enter every single thing.

**The Pump - Hardware**

The t:slim does have a touchscreen and as such you should be as careful as you would be with your phone. I keep my pump in my left pocket so I don't worry too much about it but I am worried what will happen if I drop it (which I did a non-insignificant number of times with my Paradigm). No screen scratches though.

The reservoir is Tandem's big thing - instead of using a plunger to inject insulin from the reservoir it uses suction to pull insulin from the reservoir and then push it into the tubing. I've found that this leads to faster insulin injection without any discomfort. It also allows the reservoir to be much much smaller (directly leading to the smaller pump size). Although they do not advertise it

A full charge lasts a long time. I last charged the pump on Saturday and I have 50% power left. Were I to plug in it would be back at 100% in 30 minutes. Tandem suggests that you charge it each day while you're in the shower to keep a full charge. But, or my car. Plenty of options and I no longer have to buy AAA batteries. Benefits abound.

**The Pump - Complaints** (yup

So

1. I can turn off insulin delivery just like I would do on my Paradigm **but** the pump will audibly alarm after 10min (might be 15min), I just set a temp basal of 0u/hr (fuck you FDA - don't tell me what I can do)

2. If, if you accidentally press outside of the ""Bolus"" button then the pump will lock itself to protect you from *butt bolusing*. Make sense. The problem, though, is I don't think the counter is reset when I correctly hit an actionable button. For example, if I hit a non-actionable part of the screen twice in a row and then hit an actionable button I would expect the counter to go back to 0. Instead, it seems to stay at 2 and if I hit a non-actionable part of the screen once it'll then lock.

3. If the pump is locked and not illuminated and I hit the home button to illuminate the lock screen then it will turn the screen off after 15 seconds. The problem is that I've set the screen timeout to be 120 seconds. It appears that timeout is not followed when on the lock screen. The timeout does appear to be followed when not on the lock-screen.

4. All priming is pump controlled. Due to the design of the reservoir it is not possible to speed up the priming of your tubing. I use to be able to change my infusion site, the priming is loud enough to be annoying.

tl;dr: It has its quirks but I won't go back to my Paradigm. Overall,False,,t5_2qhsj,1348631333.0,,T1,t3_10hm6p
1347148393.0,zku5k,Stopped using the pump - my life is better,ClydeTjenkins,17,6,28,"3 months ago I discontinued using my medtronic paradigm pump for therapy. My A1C went from 8.9 (in june - fuck) to 7.1 (results attained yesterday). I used the pump for over 8 years. 

Pros:
- It's more of a habit to test sugar --&gt; inject novolog for me. I don't feel injecting willy-nilly. On the pump
- NOTHING IN YOUR POCKET ALL THE TIME
- Get to make some people uncomfortable when you inject in front of them.
- No need for the ridiculously expensive pump supplies.
- ""NO DELIVERY""...not a problem anymore (no mechanical failures).
- Swimming is easier now. Paradigm is not waterproof. 

Cons: 
- Not as easy. More of a process to correct than simply taking a thing out of your pocket and pressing a button. 

This isn't for everyone. It seems like going backwards but for me it is working. If you are having trouble controlling your BG on the pump, some weeks not). Let me know if you ever did this or plan on it! I would be happy to answer any questions.

This morning I went to see my usual doctor to get my perscriptions for my test strips. He asked how many I use a day and I said on average 10 as I eat several times a day and I live a pretty busy lifestyle


He told me checking that much isn't necesary, then I said well if Lantus lowers me during the afternoon that would mean I am overdosing on it and eating to compensate the low, or do you think Lantus magically starts working more effectively when I eat carbs? Carbs = glucose!


He told me I have to stick to certain insulin units a day, that I don't need to test before exercise. I am basically not allowed to live like a normal person, I am only allowed to eat 3 times a day as that is the insulin I am ""programmed"" to use. This man makes no sense. I told him I need to do it the way I am doing it now to avoid complications in the future and in the long run it is better for the public healthcare as they will save money on me from not having any complications if I manage a great control.


He told me an A1C level of 6.7 is ""fantastic"", I doubt we even have them) and that I don't ""need it"" as I am doing fine with my pens...
