1367692866.0,1douzt,Start brainstorming now... we get to build our own samplers. Please make the arrow orange rather than blue.,SecretAgentMang,490,90,83,"There isn't quite a cigar sampler online that really draws my attention.  Of course there exists samplers that have great sticks

That's not to say that we haven't had opportunities in the past to develop samplers from companies... but that always ends up non-satisfactory as the company rarely has the vitolas or even the brands we want to include. Of course taste is subjective and there isn't one sampler to rule them all

Insanemo and I were discussing this issue with the owner of Casa de Montecristo

**He proposed an idea.**

""Talk to the members of your community and see what cigars they want in the sampler - make as many samplers as you would like.  We will put it together at a discounted price

I think we are going to take you up on that offer Sam...

----

Insanemo and I discussed possibilities

**Sampler 1 - The Beginner Sampler**
---

This will be a sampler that will include a rainbow of different cigars - flavors/sizes/etc. - and will be a learning tool for those who want to start smoking cigars or want to have a better understanding of what is available on the market to them.  When they ask, we can suggest the beginner sampler.  On top of that we can include some literature so they can learn about the cigar and the profile, while they smoke it.

**Sampler 2 - Anything Goes (5)**
---

Any cigar that Casa de Montecristo carries is fair game (and trust me

**Sampler 3 - Anything Goes (10)**
---

Same deal - any cigar we want, Opus X's, and Padron 26/64's - high price doesn't necessarily mean superb flavor and quality.

-----

As this progresses there will always be more room for samplers.  What I need you to do now is **brainstorm some cigars you would like to see in these samplers below**.  Make sure you signify which cigar you want in which sampler

You don't need to list out the entire sampler either - if there is one cigar or a few you would like to see in one of the samplers

But make sure you tell us why it belongs in the sampler.

**Remember:** We can make samplers out of all of CdM's hard to find collection

**I will be reposting next week so we can finalize details.**

----

As for what is available - like I said

----

Just to preemptively quell any possible suspicions - Insanemo and I are regular customers of Casa de Montecristo and we host a lot of herfs there (like the upcoming [**September Meetup**](http://redd.it/1d1gjt)).  What we don't do is profit from doing any of this.  Sam appreciates our business and wants us to be able to create samplers with his product. Simple as that.

I don't know the exact details yet

**If you are interested

If you have any comments/concerns/questions

If this goes through and you want to be that special somebody who designed the cutter itself... you can either post your design below or PM me the design. Assume the design will be placed on a [X1-X3 chassis](http://www.aficionado-a-havanas.com/images/xidetail.jpg). Later on we can vote on designs.  (for the design please leave out the reddit alien logo and the word 'Reddit' for legal reasons.  '/r/cigars' is allowed.)

edit: [Here is another Xikar rep expressing interest](https://twitter.com/XikarSWRep/status/226528560209330176).  This was after he asked what design we would use.

edit 2: Insanemo is going to look into having Reddit to allow us to use 'Reddit' and/or the Reddit Alien.

edit 3: We are more likely to get the x1-x3 customized as of now.  It also seems to be the more popular choice of cutter, or a few bucks less.  


edit 4: Wow!  Front page of /r/cigars!  

edit 5:  This is now the no. 1 link in the history of /r/cigars.  This better go through.

edit 6: As I further research Xikar

edit 7: Keep getting intel that Reddit demands profit on items with 'Reddit' and Snoo the Alien.  The designs can't have these.  Keep that in mind when creating your design.

Life happens. Everyone understands that. What makes the difference of a good and bad trader

Committing to trades when there is even a slight chance something might come up.
---

If there is a big event

Not packaging your cigars correctly.

This one is a no-brainer. Cigars are fragile, which may have caused damage to the cigars I shipped. I have learned from that experience and now ship all cigars with some sort of humidification method.

This might be a useful tool for contests, etc. in which voting influence isn't affected by current score.

/u/humanash actually works for them


Fortunately for us, I'll let you and anyone else who wants chime in to see what would be preferred. I could do a small discount across the board, say in the 5% area off everything we carry. Alternatively, I could offer a more substantial discount, say like 15-20% off plus free shipping on what would amount to approximately 70% of our cigar inventory, but would leave out the other 30% of the cigars and all the pipes/pipe tobacco. The cigar selection would be pretty darn good, would include the majority of our most popular brands. Basically, along with a small number of other lesser-known brands and the rare/ltd ed stuff like Opus


Okay, or something to the tune of about 20% off plus free shipping for most things, leaving out only some of the limited edition or hard to find stuff plus General Cigar products. 

Which would you guys prefer?
I'll post comments of the two options

1354116288.0,13xpsw,Proposed Updates: /r/Cigars Guidelines. (please upvote for maximum visibility),SecretAgentMang,187,31,162,"The mods and I have been working on updating our guidelines for the past few days but instead of posting them and calling it a day

The reason for guideline changes and updates was that we didn't feel the existing guidelines were clear enough and there was a lot of content that was left uncovered.  Too many posts sat in a gray area and it was hard for us to determine whether some things were truly spam or not.

Although we are not as recognized as BOTL, we are the fastest growing cigar community with roughly 50 subscriptions a day. While fourth in size now, it isn't impossible to believe that we will one day be the largest community in the world (at the current growth rate).

Because of this, and junk posts, and we as mods not only need to be able to determine what to remove, but we want the community to help as well.

**So our goals for these new guidelines:**

- A one-stop post for all members to see what they can and can't do.

- To give the mods the ability to remove spam

- Rules for Site and Company owners so /r/Cigars isn't taken advantage of.  *These rules also show that they can post within reason.*

So please read through and provide feedback.  Thanks!

**His History as I Know It**

I've had the opportunity to discuss CCC with Jim countless times since the first time we met back in October.

Jim has a family of entrepreneurs  - simple as that.  As entrepreneurs

At some point between the time he started rolling and now

So begins CCC.

----

**Why should we help?**
----  

While I don't review cigars

So instead of discussing cigar band designs and other *froofy* stuff with Jim, and survive, I berated him - question after question until I was satisfied with his answers.  Every time we visited at the local lounge I quizzed him with taxes, crop consistency, production speed, distribution, and his blends in general. I'll give it to him

My remaining skepticism was thwarted when I attended Big Burn Chicago - the first sponsored cigar event in the Chicago area.  While there were quite a few big name companies being represented at the event

Despite my best efforts

It's because of this I have taken time to vouch for him.  Not because I am being paid

- **The Draco**


- **The Swashbuckler**

Both of these blend recipes are a secret to me.  I am waiting to hear back from Jim about the description of each cigar

----

**What is a Build'A'Humidor Giveaway?**
----

Essentially, and after the giveaway is over, we will randomly select four winners to receive four awesome prizes - a pseudo-lottery. 

During the entirety of the event, and the individual who sent them in.  Each Saturday, we will have a post featuring the best packages sent in.

At the end of the event

---


**Prizes**
----

**4th Place**: 5% of all the cigars that are sent in

**3rd Place**: 10% of all the cigars that are sent in

**2nd Place**: A desktop humidor

**1st Place**: A Romeo y Julieta humidor, and 50% of all the cigars that are sent in

----

**Cigars as Entries**
----


There will be a possibility of receiving 15 entries. You will be able to send in a maximum of five cigars

- $5-$10 cigars will be worth 1 entry

- $11 and up cigars will be worth 2 entries

- Anything that we determine to be very special/rare will be an additional entry. (We will determine if it is special/rare when you submit your entry)

To gauge MSRP

**For those who are not able to participate and send in cigars:**

We are discussing a potential third way of entering which would be receiving entries by chipping into the final shipping pot.  It will cost a pretty penny to ship out all the prizes and we might need help!  This option will be revealed later on.

**What isn't allowed?**

- Cubans (we love Cubans as much as the next guy

- Infused (we do not have a separate humidor for infused cigars so they will not be permitted for entry)

- Gurkha (the MSRP on these cigars are ridiculous

- Unbanded cigars.  Your cigar must have a band on it.


----

**TO ENTER**
----

**Send a message to /u/BuildAHumi with the cigars you are entering.**  (Every message received will be responded to

Example:

&gt; *Title: Build'A'Humi Entries*

&gt; - *Joya de Nicaragua CyB Lancero*

&gt; - *Tatuaje Little Monsters 'The Mummy'*

&gt; - *Illusione Epernay*

&gt; - *2012 Oliva V Belicoso*

&gt; - *Padron 2000*

In response you will be notified with:

- If there are any cigars in your list not permitted

- How many entries you will be receiving

- A shipping address to send to

Once you receive the go ahead

(For those who have sent in their list previously

----

**Shipping**
----

It is very important that your shipping method keeps the cigars intact.  Anything that arrives in bad shape will not be counted as an entry

- USPS Small Flat Rate boxes are free and easy to use (**[within the US it is $5.15 to ship if you 'click n print' on USPS's website](https://cns.usps.com/go)**)

- Place cigars in a sealed plastic bag (you do not need a humidity element if you do this correctly)

- Pad the inside of the box with anything to cushion the bag of the cigars

- On a piece of paper

- **[Here are some other great shipping tips](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/1byzx2/water_pillows_have_a_reputation_for_leaking_and/)** from /u/z6joker9

We will be allowing non-US members to join but they will need to cover any additional shipping expenses

----

**Rules and Considerations**
----

We are going to be as fair as humanly possible and to do so we will lay out the rules for everyone to see.  Nothing surprising below

- Must be 18 or older (or legal smoking age in your location to participate)

- For non [+] members

- While you are free to send cigars from your humidor

- We will only allow one package per address

- The moderators of this subreddit are not liable for anything

- Any broken, moldy, beetle-infested and dry cigars will be disregarded and not used for entry

- /r/Cigars moderators are not permitted to enter

- Any cigar that is less than $5 MSRP will not count as an entry

- Each prize is worth 1/1

- We will not pay the return fee for any cigars that are not permissible to the above standards

I didn't bring a lighter with me (TSA regulations)

It took eight matches to get one that would stay lit

This did not occur. As I desperately tried to light another match and keep the cigar from going out, but had burned for almost three inches on another.

I had been constantly puffing on the cigar this whole time, I couldn't taste the cigar, and the sun had gone down. With a heavy heart, I gave up.

This was when I realized that something was crawling over my legs. Crabs had come out of the rocks in the dark, cursing and yelling. A couple clung steadfastly to me, and I continued to yell as I tried to knock them off of me.

I fell on my ass, who had been dispatched because a guest called the front desk complaining of a strange man smoking a substance while yelling curses and flapping his arms around. The guards let me go, with a warning not to disturb the guests.

So here's my plan of attack, and one for those looking to help with [+]s. But instead of doing matching on a one at a time basis, I'm going to set up pairs on Mondays and Fridays.

This way I should have enough time to set up matches and in turn beg for verified members to help out.  Any member willing to help out more than one b/sotl would be amazing and can have all my internet points.

I will post a reminder on the day prior to the matching to hopefully drum up some more peeps to help out.

I was wrong. 
Shortly after signing up for their 250 club in May

At the end of June, I'm really confused as to why I received this when I know I cancelled everything to do with them. I check my bank account, and another freaking $67.45 has been taking out from TC. At this point, I'm really..uhh..upset. Yeah, let's go with that. The next day I get the other package of cigars, a 16-count sampler. I call them after the weekend is over because customer service isn't open during then(who does that?)and after waiting over 10 minutes on hold, I finally get to speak to someone. After a very long discussion and many holds later

15 days later
..what? I call them and fortunately I do not have to wait so long to talk to someone. I ask why I only received that amount back and after waiting back and forth on hold, not $52.45. I sent it back in one box with one return postage, it should be $7.50 taken off, not $14. They go talk to the manager. They say they have to look in the warehouse and that they will call me back tomorrow. Tomorrow. Wow. 

All that to say..don't support them at all. With anything. They are a bad company who lie and steal. I'm so pissed off right now.

We are going to do a **[Salomon](http://en.cigar-wiki.com/Shapes#Salomon)**! This is a size we've never done before, and crate-aged for 90 days. This is premium leaf here boys. We're talking *top notch* Estilo Cubano blend. This is by far our most popular blend with tobacco from Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and it just got a **90** rating in Cigar Aficionado.

We should have pricing worked out by the end of the week and hopefully pre-sale orders too if I can get the powers that be to sign off on this deal. The price will be attractive

Lastly, here's the pitch:

* Think you're a decent graphic designer? Excellent. **Email us**(socialmedia at kretek.com) with your contact information. **Don't** send any comps quite yet, phone number, where in the world you live, and an email.

* Not an artist? You majored in English, **upvote** the ones you like. The top vote-getters will move on to the next round.

I sit here, reflecting over the last 2 months since I have returned to moderating this subreddit.  I think even further to when I initially joined, the community that was, and the conversation surrounding it.  Between then and now, I became a moderator with DosFool, and shortly after we brought on Deelowe (we miss them both, and no they are not dead, verification system, herfs across the world


Since our inception 3 years ago, and now average about 32 members a day.  Based on trends and the magic of statistics, by this Christmas, we will almost double our current members, reaching a little over 11,000 members, if not significantly more.


**What does this mean?**


It means that we are going to get many new aficionados (everyone is an aficionado at their own level), or relating to, the business of cigars**.  Is has not changed since I have followed this subreddit, nor will it in the future.  


We are not a small corner of reddit.com anymore.  Not only are we being noticed more and more throughout reddit, review websites, and cigar CEO's themselves.  Is this a good thing?  Time will tell.  Just like you, I do not want r/cigars to turn into free ad space for these companies, nor will I let that happen with the help of the other mods (and your responsible use of the *report* button).  At the same time, this opens up a lot of opportunity for the reason we came here in the first place: cigars.  Special r/cigar blending sessions are in the works, and we are already seeing reddit only deals, people are going to notice.


I came back to this subreddit two months ago very naive and cocky, I wanted things to go back the way they used to, pre-1000 members, when IRC chats used to be chats in this subreddit, and where the legends (old guys) started their beginnings here. As reviewers, ZacktheStogieMan, xxReckonerxx, elninodiablo, but I know I can't have it


That being said, share their experiences, and perhaps their years of cigar knowledge.  Above all, I am calling myself out as moderator for this one.


There are going to be posts we don't like, by all means.  I can't promise that members will get upset and downvote it, but that is how reddit works.  Find your karma elsewhere because you probably won't find much here. Slackwaresupport has created [r/cigarimages](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigarimages/) where you can post pictures without fear of being criticized.  I could only hope that you wouldn't criticize anyone in r/cigars, and it bums me out that there was a wanting for a split.  Things happen.  No hard feelings.  I have already found myself looking at some of the pictures (tim0k takes the sexiest pictures).


I am sorry for the long read, just as our current well-being is up to all of you; **the aficionado's that have built this amazing community**.


To those that think I am breathing hot air without display of change; I have asked the moderators to step back a few feet and let the community decide how things are going to be ran; through your tolerance and actions.  The mods will continue to direct traffic


What I ask of you is to be open minded, they are great (and provide the best and worst nsfw links).  Get in a Google+ chat.  Talk to other members before you throw something in 6500+ aficionados' faces.


**Above all


With many many thanks

Russ

**THE CAUSE**

/r/cigars and the Leaf and Flame cigar team are gathering the troops to host the biggest cigar raffle in which all proceeds go towards the Movember Campaign.  With special donations from Drew Estate, we have over $2000 of cigars and accessories that we will be raffling off to support Men’s Health.

A few weeks ago the idea was born to create a raffle to raise funds for [The Movember Campaign](http://www.movember.com/); a group that grew mustaches for the month of November to raise funds and awareness for men’s health issues primarily prostate and testicular cancer. Movember focuses on spending the maximum amount of funds on men’s health initiatives and using minimal funds for fundraising and administration. Their total administration cost is 2.1% and fundraising costs are 7.9%.

The majority of the funds collected by Movember are donated to foundations such as the Prostate Cancer Foundation and the LIVESTRONG Foundation.

Testicular cancer is the most common cancer in men between the ages of 20 and 34, and watch this self-examination video.

Once again

I just got off the phone with Ariel Santos

Here's the lowdown:

He can't really match the fantastic deal that pipesandcigars.com is offering us

We would become one of the accounts he manages

He is also going to try to get us an introductory sampler. This sampler would be exclusive to us, i.e. 20 sticks for $60.

We need to work on a list of brands that I can email him in the next few days. These brands would not only comprise the sticks in the sampler

/u/isaidnothanks had a great idea in requesting the brands that appear on the list of restrictions that pipesandcigars.com can't get us deals on.  I think we could build on that list and remove cigars that there is no interest in, etc. 

Please comment with any concerns

I have commented the list of cigars

I expect to have this finalized by Sunday

Thanks

Keeping discussion and knowledge at eye level was our biggest goal for Leaf and Flame.  While we do have some great discussions on r/Cigars, we have incorporated an advanced search feature with a tagging system.  I myself am still getting used to the new discussion style, but we are experimenting with different ways to discuss within threads.

Trading is different on Leaf and Flame, there is an ISO (in search of) and LTB (looking to buy) area. I posted an ISO for a Tatuaje Old Man and the C and within 12 hours had a trade set up with Justforrazors. Instead of using a [+] verification system we have an eBay style rating system.  Once a trade/purchase is completed you are encouraged to rate your trader/buyer/seller.  The rating system is public, so you will be able to see who has good ratings, and who has bad ratings.  

Another new feature includes the greater ability to have discussions with members of the cigar industry.  We already have members of Alec Bradley, Halfwheel, Tampa Sweethearts, and AVO on the forum, with more to come.  For those who are uninterested in industry reps using forums for advertisement, posts like those will be limited to a section called 'Retailer Specials' and 'Industry News'.  We have been working hard on getting more companies involved in Leaf and Flame, with a goal of being one of the most informed

As we continue to build, we will continue to make it the best cigar forum we can, based on what the community wants.  So when you get a moment head over to www.leafandflame.com.  If you like what you see and want to help mold the forum into something great, create an account.  If not, no worries!  We aren't trying to fracture the community, but to provide an alternative way to have discussion and interact with all aspects of the cigar world. Speedgeek, Bitaemo

Always remember to smoke the god damn cigars you love

I've tried tongue scraping, various kinds of food.  The best I've been able to achieve is masking the odours for a few hours at best.

After significant research into what actually causes cigar breath (pyridines primarily along with pyrazines) I stumbled across an activated mouth wash called Smart Mouth.  

It's not a cheap product

The setup:  Smoke 2 cigars in succession in the evening.  Brush teeth

Test breath on girlfriend (who detests cigar breath) and ask if breath stinks.  Do not lead her with any information.

The result?  No trace of cigar odour.  None.  She said my breath smelled fresh and slightly minty.  Not like mouth wash but just fresh.

I'm going to continue to test it out but the first results are encouraging.",self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/136l5s/hate_that_funky_cigar_mouth/

I know that several of you here are just as involved in different subs as you are here and I think that is absolutely awesome.  Today I realized that as we are moving towards the 5

Come on guys... let get serious... This reddit is growing very quickly and these things are going to happen now and again, he’s more than able to take the brunt of this one.  He’s put more information about himself on the Internet than most of us are willing to do.  I've gotten to have some conversations with him and he's a good guy that any of us would probably not mind to have a cigar with.


There are a few directions that we can go from here:

1. Upvote and Downvote: Use them... it was created to make things trend upwards if people like them and downward if they are disliked.  If you don’t like it

2. Post some content, there are several guys on here that are doing a great job and helping several people along the way. 

3. Unsubscribe. Plain and simple. You no longer are enjoying yourself

4. When was the last time that you were smoking with some of your friends and were talking about the “woody notes” or the “grassy scent off of the foot”... you probably didn’t, holy crap she said yes! You tell your friends that. You show your friends your new business cards because who doesn’t love having something with their name on it? Grilling out with buddies and taking a silly picture.  If you’ve ever ventured to the wonderful sidebar you will find this in the first link:


*“I like to think of this place as a virtual cigar lounge where you can share what you're interested in. Since you're here for cigars in the first place, or that school you just got accepted to while you're smoking your celebratory stick (or that girl you broke up with, or the terrible day at work you had that you can console with an always-faithful, ever-relaxing stick)”*
	*BloodOrangeBitters (10-1-2011)*


If we call each other Brothers and Sisters

Please use this to discuss moving forward because I do not want this “lounge” to be tainted by someone that was tired of something that was not hand-rolled by lit by a torch. 

Happy smoking fellow B/SOTL

Post ripped from Mark(N2Adventure) at www.cigarasylum.com 2008.

This has been on my mind for quite some time and only write this with the most heartfelt intentions.

I have noticed something that is a little disturbing to me but really none of my business but as a friend to many

The problem?

I've noticed many BOTLs who are over extended on their credit in the name of acquiring more cigars. I've heard some disturbing balances being maintained on their credit cards, etc... due to large number of purchases of cigars.

I believe that with the amount of discussions in the forums, that it is easy to get caught up in the ""keeping with the Jones'"" mentality but I would be remiss if I didn't express my concern.

PLEASE keep in mind that cigars are a hobby and should be BUDGETED for and is SOLELY based on disposable income. You SHOULD NOT be ""investing"" in cigars - they are a consumable that are susceptible to damage (fire, beetles, theft, etc...).

People talk about a ""cigar budget"" and we all laugh when we blow that budget. But like any other aspect of your life, retirement, etc...

The senseless act of carrying credit card debt just to amass a cigar collect is not fiscally responsible and you are doing yourself a disservice in the long run.

The one thing that I have learned over the nearly 2 decades of being into cigars is that it's is not about the cigars. The cigars are just a compliment to the commaradarie. Yeah

My point?

In the great scheme of the cigar community

So please

Happy smoking my friends.",self,t5_2r090,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/typcd/fiscal_responsibility_and_cigars/

I think something like this would be good for this community too. List all of the popular (and unpopular) cigar sites (CigarBid, CI, Thompsons) and list the pros and cons of each.

It would also be cool, such as the Cigar Surgeon, Robby Ras, etc.

I just wanted to put this idea out to the public and see what you all thought.

I, or ""look what I picked up"".  That is great that you are doing something cigar related, but its importance is lessened without a backstory, explanation of the cigars, a simple review, or anecdote.  We can all take pictures from our phone and do a quick upload, but I believe the majority can agree that it is getting old.


**Proposal:**

Create a self-post with links to the pictures or picture and add some dialogue.  If you received a new box of cigars, maybe trade them?  


Even if you really want that sweet sticky karma that is plentiful within this subreddit (haha)


We are not going to start deleting posts with just pictures, to invigorating conversation.

I post this as I reflect on the important things: human bonds, I watch my friends and their children hold eachother and weep.  You see they were given the evacuation order yesterday.  They had to choose what they could pack in a single car in 15 minutes to be the potential last of their worldly possessions.  They just learned their house is surrounded on 3 sides by the fire and will likely be lost.  The 4 of them--the couple responsible for introducing my wife and I and their two small children have moved in with us.  

Watching and holding them as they mourn for the impending loss of nearly everything they own

I received the following response:

&gt;Thank you for taking the time to let me know about the organizational changes within your R/Cigars group. We too have had some changes at Cigars International. Your previous contact at CI
 
&gt;I would like to take this opportunity to introduce myself. My name is Jared Gulick, it would be much appreciated.
 
&gt;How many group members are in R/Cigars?
 
&gt;Which cigars are you looking to purchase?
 
&gt;How many boxes of each cigar are you looking to purchase?
 
&gt;What is price point you would like to stay within?
 
&gt;Do you have contact info for the individual now in charge of your group?
 
&gt;These few questions will help me in establishing a deal that will be mutually benefical. Again

If we wish to continue pursuing this, but it will be slow going as I don't have a lot of free time during standard business hours to to engage in project leadership.  Second, what do we actually want realistically?  I recommend we use this thread to indicate what we want, both in terms of type of discount(flat rate for a product, specific discount %, rotating deals, etc), boxes

Self post

Update 4/24:  I sent the first request to Jared yesterday evening.  After a lengthy writeup about the sub and the benefits the deal could offer I put forth 3 feature requests.  The requests were for a base discount

Most of the suggestions in the **[Suggestion Box](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/126bs6/suggestion_box/)** were to produce a new type of flair.  While we would love to add these extra things

So for the next month (maybe even longer) we will be automating the [+] trade verification system.  This way we hope that those without their [+] will be able to get set up in trades more quickly.

Another thing we have decided is to make AotM (Aficionado of the Month) more special.  Not only will they have the task of representing the community, they will choose the theme and run the month's trade.  So if you are chosen to be the December AotM, you will set up the trade and theme for January!  (Since I am bringing this up now, Avrus, please let me know if you want to theme and set up the holiday trade).

----

**WHAT WE NEED FROM THE COMMUNITY:**

We need a new moderator! This moderator will take over all verification processes for the time being while we implement an automated trade verification system.  You will take over for Bitaemo in setting up trades and then giving [+] Flair to those who complete a successful trade.  Once the automation process is done

What you need to realize is, I want you to know that greater men than I have done better jobs setting up coolerdors.  The main goal of this post is to get you to grasp that (a) anyone can do it, and (b) it is surprisingly effective. 



**For those who don’t have the time to read the 1648 words written below
---

*1. Choose a clean cooler with a good seal*

*2. Clean and dry it thoroughly*

*3. Line it with cedar

*4. Charge the coolerdor*

*5. Fill it with cigars*


**[Now to turn my Igloo Cooler into a coolerdor]( http://i.imgur.com/usi9tcT.jpg?1)**

---


**Choosing the right cooler**
---



New or used

* **Size**

Pick a size that you are comfortable with.  When I scrounged for my first cooler (60qt) out of my garage, I crawled up into the attic and found an identical cooler.  The two stacked perfectly and sat in the corner of my closet. 

* **Seal**


It is essential that the cooler you choose has a good seal. Check it for gaps, which is pulled even tighter by the two clamps.


* **Cleanliness**

I have gone the path of the used cooler (you don't need to). This is perfectly fine as long as the cooler can be cleaned.  If after cleaning there is any type of smell or grunge


* **Price**


Walmart and Amazon are the only two stores I have ever considered purchasing coolers from.  Igloo and Coleman are going to be the best quality for seal, and durability, so I suggest sticking with one of these brands.  Buying or finding used is always a better option (as it saves $$$), but if you need to buy, do some research and find a price you are comfortable with.

---


**Cleaning the cooler**
---


(Before you begin


Regardless of it being new or used, I use ammonia-free Sparkle (Windex knock-off) and paper towels to **[make sure all the dirt, grime, and dust are removed]( http://i.imgur.com/KHdaoC1.jpg?1)**.  Clean the underside of the cooler lid the same way, and afterwards take a wet cloth and wipe it down, finishing with a cloth to dry the cooler.

There is a special method I take to cleaning the inside of the cooler to insure there is no odor when it is all said and done.  **[Fill the cooler with hot water]( http://i.imgur.com/y49qHr4.jpg?1)** and .5 cups of ammonia free cleaner (per 50qts).  Once again, give the inside of the cooler a good scrubbing with the **[water still in it]( http://i.imgur.com/VTodWsi.jpg?1)**.  Empty out the water and rinse the inside of the cooler out thoroughly with hot water, removing any excess water/cleaner solution.

**Dry it thoroughly.**  


After letting it sit for another hour, and dry thoroughly.  If there are no odors and it is **[glistening]( http://i.imgur.com/GLacnTE.jpg?1)**, move on to the next step.

---

**Turning the cooler into a COOLERDOR**
---


Plastic does not absorb moisture

**1: The Fill and Pray Method**


This is the method of filling your cooler with cigars and hoping that the simple act of being full of cigars will keep the cooler at the precise humidity you want to achieve.   The more cigars in the cooler


**2: Box Tetris**

Keeping boxes in your cooler is a fantastic way of regulating humidity and keeping your cigars organized at the same time.  You can get empty boxes for free (or fairly cheap) at local B&amp;M’s or eBay.  I prefer **[simple traditional style boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/odoMLbr.jpg?1)** as they fit better and are easily stacked within the cooler.

**3: Cedar Linings Playbook**

Lining the inside of the cooler is the most hardcore yet effective way of tricking your cooler into believing it is a humidor.  You can purchase cedar roll for fairly cheap (but I have no idea where).  I used the **[cedar found in boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/YwJGw78.jpg?1)**


All in all, boxes, and cigars I will be placing in the cooler by the end of this post.


---

**Humidification**
---


For those with desktop humidors or Tupperware


Enter **Exquisicat Crystals**.


This is a very cheap and reliable method of maintaining your coolerdor’s humidity. At **[Petsmart you can purchase]( http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.jsp?productId=11256828)** an 8lb package


There are plenty of other methods of humidification which can be found in the wiki or via Google


---

**Charging the coolerdor**
---

This is another area where there are infinite variables on how you can charge your coolerdor


For every 50qts, but time will tell.


Because of space, ensuring that all the crystals are damp with **DISTILLED WATER**.  

*Do not use tap water. Do not use anything else besides distilled water as this is the best solution to use to prevent mold.* **Science.**


Afterwards, I simply use the same method to keep the coolerdor regulated on a day to day basis after all is said and done. 


I then **[place all of my empty boxes]( http://i.imgur.com/JKkYmNy.jpg?1)** inside of the coolerdor with a correctly calibrated digital hygrometer

---

**Playing the waiting game**
---


The next step requires patience.  Every 6 hours or so (or whenever you get around to looking) check your hygrometer.  If it hasn’t reached the humidity percentage you want it to be, and keep waiting.  If it reaches the humidity you want it to be, you are all set.

---

**Coolerdor organization**
---


Stocking your newly constructed coolerdor is the best part of the process.  However you want to do it is up to you, so all of the cigars will be organized in those boxes used to charge the coolerdor (*Wow SecretAgentMang! How Clever!*).



Thank you.



Once I organize the boxes the way I want them

---

**Integrating a fan system (optional)**
---

Integrating a fan system is completely optional. The purpose of this is to prevent humidity pockets from forming in your coolerdor.  Essentially


I don’t want to get into too much detail on this because honestly I don’t know enough about wiring computer fans etc. to give you the best information possible.  There are walkthroughs online on how to get a powered fan into your coolerdor


If you don’t want the hassle of wires, which should last about 2-3 months before the battery needs to be changed.


---

**[THE FINISHED PRODUCT]( http://i.imgur.com/WMEnwrg.jpg?1)**

**Expenses:**

- Used Igloo Cooler (Holds 500 Cigars) - $10

- Xikar Rectangular Digital Hygrometer - $20

- Exquisicat Crystals (8lb) - $14

- Distilled Water - $2

- Oust fan - $14

**Total: $60**

---

If I can do this, it isn’t as pretty as a desktop or cabinet humidor, but it saves you more money which can be used to fill the coolerdor with cigars. 

I hope that this walkthrough has been informative

**Thanks for reading

**1** I used a picture of a cigar in a recent post of mine. The reason I hunted for a picture online was my camera was stolen and I smoked the last two cigars for my review to post. The pictures I had were on this camera and were not uploaded to my servers. After browsing google images

**2** I got a notice to my website that this picture didn't belong to me and that the owner of the picture wanted it removed within 48 hours. This is the email I recived:

*My name is Bryan Glynn and I am the Owner of BGPictures.com &amp;
 CigarObsession.com. A website that your company hosts (according to
 WHOIS information) is infringing on at least one copyright owned by my
 company.*

 *A photo was copied onto your servers without permission. The original
 PHOTO

*http://cigarobsession.com/wp-content/gallery/afdc3/20090909_cigar_0002.jpg*

I promptly removed the photograph and contacted Bryan through email asking him if I could use the picture that I found on imgur until my local B&amp;M got another shipment of the Don Carlos.

**3** Bryan replied with:

Don't contact me again.  You are sorry you gut busted

**4** I created an account prier to receiving this email and commented on his post expressing my apologies for using his image.

**5** I tried calling Bryan before receiving the above email as well to which I was going to apologize to him and let him know I did not know it was his image to begin with. Where I had found the image and email him the link to where it was at.

**6** After receiving Bryan's email

With this said

I did change domain names to www.cigarwarrior.com. There were a number of reasons for changing domains and one of which isn't to duck and try to cover my tracks. I understand I messed up and the appropriate thing to do would have been to wait until I got a replacement camera.


**Edit: For formatting and the following:**

I wanted to add that I am not doing reviews for monetary gain or special treatment from anyone. I don't have adds on my website and not looking for hits to it either.

I link reviews on reddit to cigars that I have reviewed not so you will come to my website

I started the blog after years of smoking cigars with friends. I gained their trust with my recommendations and what I got out of cigars they could relate to. I wanted to blog and bring my thought to paper (or keyboard). The end result is a full blown blog with reviews and cigar events etc.

**Edit #2**

I talked to a regular at my cigar lounge about this (lawyer). He sated since the picture was removed within the 48 hour windows for these actions and there wasn't any monetary gain from his image

I also talked to him about the harassing emails and phone calls from the people on his blog and he stated I can file a harassment lawsuit against him and his website for publishing my personal phone number for malicious and harassing intent and without my consent.

**Edit #3**

Complaint has been filled with my local sheriff's office for removal of content for harassment and no consent to post my personal information.

**Edit #4**

I want the reddit cigar community to know that I don't post my reviews on here to gain anything from it. I like the people I have met and traded cigars with. I love to share my cigar smoking experiences. I have no ads on my website nor do I gain anything from your visit. I know my reviews won't appeal to everyone and that is ok. Just like cigars

Thanks Reddit for the support and the kind pms that were sent.

----

**When?**
----

**Friday

----

**What?**
----

What is this you ask? A giant non-commercial herf that not only supports two amazing cigar lounges in Chicago, and chat with members of the industry. We will stuff our faces, smoke til our heads explode, and probably drink til we are xXReckonerXx obnoxious.

----

**Who is invited?**
----

Everybody.  We have Avrus (aka CigarSurgeon) who has already booked a ticket from Canada.  Other /r/Cigars members that are seriously considering making the journey:

- Speedgeek - South Carolina

- T_Avalon - New York

- Bitaemo - Canada

- TheMcG - Canada

- dlm04e - Florida

- Champster - Mississippi

- VictoryVino - Michigan

Of course we already have a bunch of Chicago redditors like myself, kilrpenguin, Tanavarro etc. that will be there!

----

**Why?**
----

Because fuck you

----

**Where?**
----

**Friday - [Tesa Cigar Co.](http://tesacigars.com/)**

Friday night will be the first leg of the Chicago Meetup.  We are still sorting out details with the owner of Tesa, catered dinner, beer sampling, and cigars will line the evening and well into the night. Afterwards whoever is interested will hit the bars in downtown Chicago.  Tesa is BYOB.

**Saturday - [Casa de Montecristo](http://casademontecristo-chicago.com/)**

Saturday will be the second day and the longer of the two days.  From 12pm til midnight, we will have a rum tasting (pending). Casa de Montecristo is BYOB.

----

**Tickets**
----

**Tickets will begin to sell July 8th**

**There will only be 150 spots for each night - so tickets will be limited.**

And as I was in the middle of writing this, but that is a fantastic deal.


**What you receive with your ticket purchase:**

- A gift bag with 7-8 cigars (3-4 Cigars at Tesa

- Dinner at Tesa

- Dinner at Casa de Montecristo
 
- A raffle ticket for each event (for every $25 you spend at the B&amp;M

- Access to liquor tastings that we are putting together (21 years of age and up)

**What the ticket is covering for us:**

- $15 is going to charity (charity TBD)

- $10 is going to Tesa for catering costs (in theory)

- $10 is going to Casa de Montecristo for catering costs

- (If you purchase the CRA ticket $25-$30 will be going to the CRA)

----

**Sponsors**
----

In order to fill the bags we need sponsors. Currently we have ~~two~~ **three** sponsors, and want to sponsor this event - please PM me.  We are going to make it worthwhile for companies to sponsor the event.

Aside from sponsors we will also have a lot of special guests

----

**Hotels and Travel**
----

We are working on getting a group rate at a Holiday Inn near Casa de Montecristo. A part of the group rate will include shuttle service between Casa de Montecristo and the hotel. It is looking to be $99 a night.

As much as Insanemo and I would like to taxi everyone around all weekend

----

**In closing**
----

There was a reason I published this event 2 months before we start selling tickets.  First of all

Second of all

If you are interested in either

------

**Thanks for putting up with my long-winded-ness!** 

If you have any questions

1344629729.0,y0ism,Cigars and Women,J_H_W,97,23,40,"As a novice in the Cigar world there’s a lot that I don’t know

*She aint gonna be one of them*.

Now, missing the mortgage, or eating hydrox ramen for dinner; but $35-$60 goes up in smoke every week and if it isn’t on fire it’s just waiting to be burned.

There’s something primal about smoking a huge stogie, drink aged whisky even though it tastes like gasoline, or punch that bully in middle school.

*It makes you feel like a man*.

For some of us, a plumbob or one of a million different other things) we came back heavy with the smell of fine tobacco.  For others maybe it was a Father, or a father figure, a baseball coach, a college professor-- someone taught us that cigars were the tools of gentlemen.  It allows a man time to think, to reflect, to gauge his current success (or his recent failures) and to come to a conclusion—if only for a minute that our place in this world is still strong. To have those fleeting moments of clarity (relaxation?) that life is sometimes just about the moment

Conversely, sewing, painting, pottery—whatever it is—they do it because at one time in their life their hero, or their mothers, grandmothers, etc did it too

What I've also learned is that every woman (like every cigar) is going to react different

1. Don’t expect her to understand why you love it

2. Don’t try to teach her why you love it
smoke there’s cancer

3. Pace yourself.  Want to kill a lady’s tolerance for cigars?  Smoke one every night, you may lose your hobby.

4. Keep the smell off you and OUT of the house.  Buy a smoking jacket

5. Tacit agreement is just as good as excitement.  Want to buy a new box of Ligas, or generally treats it like any other dumbass man activity take it as consent, but get out of the house before she can change her mind.

6. Don’t EVER talk about Cigar Bid.  

7. Don’t EVER talk about Cigar Bid

8. If it’s causing animosity or tension cut it back.  No hobby in the world is worth a lonely night on the couch (especially since you probably can’t smoke a cigar there either)

Women are our partners, and bring a certain serenity to life that we can’t find on our own.

Besides, and start making sandwiches.

First of all

Okay sweet

I've been here for a while. The subreddit has gone in and out of vogue for me, and it doesn't mean I'm right... but  it does mean I've read/lurked a lot of posts and noticed trends of this subculture. 

In that time

* The mods have been inactive. Guys, because it seems to be getting addressed - but I support it.

* I have noticed talk of idealism - how some people see this subreddit as best one way or another. There are a lot of different cigar smokers and this sub will always be an amalgamation of the different personalities of those who enjoy our hobby. Some people post a lot. Some post a little. Some will always be noobs. Some will be resident-experts. I am thankful we have such a good

* As a brief extension of that

* Lastly

Look, what I think, is the point of this subreddit: a culture for discussing cigars and mimicking the experience of smoking cigars. The former we have. Questions still get asked and appropriately answered. 

However

I propose that posts like those be replaced with self-posts. You link the picture in the post and explain a bit about the situation. You got a job? Congrats...but doing what? How long were you looking? Tell me a bit about it so I can celebrate with you. 

You got your new sticks in? Cool. What are they? How much did you pay? Why'd you choose those? 

Someone's post the other day asking about favorite smoking places was a great example of this. Open-ended. Facilitated good discussion.

**At the end of the day

-Your Fellow Aficionado (who is only where he is today because of this subreddit)

Edit: To clarify: there are many posts that are VERY important in their current form: reviews, plus-trade pictures (as opposed to monthly trades, which should have some content I think). I think the google hangouts, though I have never partaken, embody my thoughts pretty damn well.

Once we pick a design and get it approved by Xikar, and Xikar will take 2-3 weeks to custom engrave and ship out the cutters.  Once Chris receives the cutters, he will get them out super quick.  Depending on popularity, Chris may open up purchases for this cutter in the future.

For $35 shipped using coupon code **RCIGARS**, and various samplers that have no purpose.  The whole idea of a sampler is to taste variety, and learn not only about the cigar provided, but to expand your knowledge on existing blends in the market.  Big thanks to Sam at Casa de Montecristo for working with us and giving us a fantastic discount, and thanks to my partner in crime /u/insanemo, who helped develop the samplers that we are very excited about (there are three more samplers arriving soon).

I pulled the motorcycle out of the garage, fired up a ROMEO and spent the afternoon in the sun detailing my bike and enjoying a very nice cigar.  

Polished off the day by giving my son his first ride on the motorcycle.....just around the block.  A ride he finished by saying

We grilled some pork chops on the grill.....and parked our butts on the couch for some playoff hockey.

Days like this are few...but MAN they are awesome!!!

At the time, My collection of pipe tobacco was modest and uninteresting, so I instead offered him a strait money for cigar trade. we ultimately agreed that I would pay him $50 and he would send me a good variety of sticks, specifics at his discretion.  after he shipped them, he messaged me saying the shipping was $14.33, this was an omen of things to come. 

when I received the package this morning (via USPS), I saw, not one, nor two, but three gallon ziploc bags filled to the brim with cigars of varying size, shape, color and brand.  I could tell he had overdone it, I wasn't quite sure yet.  

I cleared off a relatively small table in my family room and attempted to lay them all out flat, Alec Bradleys, A few Gurkhas and a good selection of Olivas and nubs on top of a Cain and a La Aurora preferido perfecto.  The rest were brands I (in my little experience) were unfamiliar with, ""decent, but not great"" as he described them. While putting them back into their bags, I took a head count and discovered he had sent me 112 cigars that seem to be worth $300+ dollars, all for the measly $50 I sent him.

Before I get much further...[I stole this idea from here](http://www.reddit.com/r/cigars/comments/qt0ga/request_cigars_for_longterm_aging/).  Credit I think goes to Robotsongs and HillbillyThinkTank in the first instance

So the idea that was offered up in the thread above was this:  get a box of 20 cigars, you'll have 2 sticks left: one for you and one for them.  When I read that thread a couple of months ago I instantly loved the idea.  Initially I thought it would only work with a boy, but I've come to the conclusion over the last couple of months that I'm doing this in either scenario.  I started smoking with my wife and I know that there are a few women on here that smoke cigars, so while the chances aren't especially high that she will want to smoke a cigar with her old man (too busy smoking slim menthol cigarettes and telling me what a dick I am I should imagine) I still want to try.  Absolute worst case scenario, I get to enjoy 18 awesome cigars as she grows up and share the 19th and 20th with my lovely wife.  Hardly a downside!

So in that same thread above, but it's a special box and I want to keep it that way.  My original plan was to give one to my father in the US, one to my step-father here in Ottawa and one to my father-in-law in England as it goes with the theme.  Problem is none of them smoke cigars and I think that the three sticks would go unsmoked and just left to dry out and crumble.  Since I want these to be enjoyed, my backup plan is to give one to each of my groomsmen from my wedding a few years ago.  I gave them each a personlaized flask filled with Glenfiddich 30 y/o at the actual wedding so it follows a theme and at the very least I know they'll each light these up!

So anyway, I'm celebrating with [this badboy today](http://imgur.com/kHTri), [here's the scan of our little alien](http://imgur.com/XWQzL) and [here's the box of My Father's](http://imgur.com/urVzg) that I'll be enjoying over the next 18 years!

**TL;DR Having a baby and smoking a stick out of the same box for 18 years..hopefully smoking the last one with the kid on his 18th bday!**

I received word of an estate sale in a very wealthy suburb near Minneapolis. I was surprised to see that among the photos of the items for sale were several humidors with some very rare and interesting cigars pictures. I steeled myself for battle. Having been raised on garage sale clothing and items for my childhood

I get up at the crack of dawn, it pays to be first) and I am the 4th person in. Score!

I stand outside in the cold talking to the guy that runs the sale. **Apparently** the guy that died was some a writer or editor for Cigar Aficionado!!!!! So I heard. His best friend already got half of his cigars and the rest were up for sale.

When the doors open there is a mad rush for the humidors and smokes. There were whole tables full of humidors and cigar boxes (which were full) and accessories. Rare ones, starts tagging entire humidors. I snag what I can. It turns out I got the best deal because...

The staff looks at this guy and goes ""Hey, realizing he has no idea what he is doing he puts everything back. Punk!

MEANWHILE I snag the choice stuff

They were asking for about $4 per stick **any stick** and in Minnesota with a 70% wholesale tax

They add up my humidor, a rare CigarFest 2012 Colibri cutter, a new fresh can of Xikar Butane, a  box of tiny cigarillos and..as it turns out.....*drum roll* 88 choice cigars from inside the humidor. For $312...

* 1 Liga Privada No.9 Cigar Rights Association Edition

As some of you may know, nor an attempt at persuading you to buy our cigars. (I'll do that another time, ha ha)

I see A LOT of posts on here about such and such deal, bid this, bid that, etc. etc. etc......and I simply just wanted to urge everyone to consider seeking out your local retailer, brick and mortar store, and supporting that local business.  Most of these retailers hold a true passion for cigars and the industry, and if you spend 5 minutes with them, was that the benefits of spending my dollars in these local shops

This wasn't a heavy hearted post.  I just wanted to create some conversation and awareness.  Support your local retailers if possible.   Trust me.....sit down with a tobacconist that has put his money on the line to open a retail store

The box gives a ""you'll laugh, ya

I.... didn't get it....  

Warning: I just started smoking cigars less than a year ago and I am nowhere near seasoned enough to write a proper review.  The following is a description of the events that happened on the night of November 29th

When I went to light the cigar I just touched the tip of my tongue to it.  Wow

I had to sit it down for a few minutes to gather my thoughts.  What the hell is this?  My mouth is on fire... I went inside and looked in the mirror and my lips were bright red.  I took a couple of deep breaths and decided to see if I could muster through it.  

Reluctantly, I have to get at least through 1/3 of one of them right? 

The first third was really creamy from what I could tell.  My mouth and tongue were on fire and pretty numb at this point.  Adrenaline started kicking in and my mind wasn't focused on flavor.  I was just looking at the cigar and thinking to myself what the hell this thing was. Right away it started burning down one side.   

The second third I was getting a little worried. The burn was getting worse and I couldn't rectify the situation.  The creaminess went away but nothing else really came through.  My mouth finally started to settle down a bit.  

The third third really had a nice earthy spice flavor to it as far as I could tell.  I think my taste buds were finally actually tasting something besides burning. The burn issues continued and by the time I was done with it

All in all

TL;DR Tonight I ate a handful of Guatemalan Insanity Peppers and spoke to a Coyote named Johnny Cash.

First

* [Cuban Cigar Website](http://www.cubancigarwebsite.com/fakes.htm) - This is one of the most useful Cuban cigar reference sites out there
* [How the seal should look](http://www.thefinerlife.com/smokers_conner/cuban_seal.htm) - Here are some great details and pictures of the seal. If the artwork and box look good
* [Another useful overview with some helpful pictures](http://www.dutyfreecubancigars.com/fakes.htm)
* [Lastly

As a side note

**Now how do you deal with somebody buying Cubans for you?**

So many people have had their friends or family who don't smoke cigars go on vacation and come back with a beautiful glass top box of Cohibas for their favorite cigar-smoking friend

* If you have any inkling that they might buy cigars but they don't know the first thing about cigars
* If they insist on buying you cigars
* If they **do** smoke cigars

Lastly - even if they're fakes, and taking the bands off is still a risky move. Cuban cigars are still 100% illegal to bring into the US no matter what you've heard.

Hopefully this alleviates some of the fake issues we've been having lately. If you have any questions

One of the young lads asks me what I am smoking. I reply, inside laughing my ass off, and they go on their merry way and the dog is now 8 feet from the parks garbage can that she is barking her non-existant balls off at is if it was R2D2 coming after her.

I figured a reddit pic was in order to document this

One thing that makes it tough to come back is the circle jerk mentality we seem to have adopted lately when it comes to trying new cigars. You probably know where I'm going with this

There was a post recently about a guy taking a trip to a B&amp;M and he asked which LP he should by as if they were the only line of cigars they carried. How can you limit your experience to just 1 stick like that?

How do you do that? By sending one or more of their cigars that you absolutely love!  Make sure you include a note telling them what that cigar is and maybe explain some things about that cigar/s!

**Rules:**

- Keep all shipping details between you and your trade partner
- Message your partner ASAP to set up trade parameters.
- Send at least 1 cigar! (But everyone automagically seems to send a metric shit ton)
- Do not screw your trade partner over. BakersGonnaBake will stop baking and then everyone is SCREWED!

You may access the site at http://rcigars.whileone.com .  I know we setup those PINs with CigarBot, so make sure you're logged into the correct account (I know you assholes have alts).  After logging in, click on Manage Addresses.

On the Address Management screen you should see your username, edit addresses, delete addresses, and if you're verified you can get access to the Search function from this screen.

**NOTE:** All addresses that were imported into the system were set to inactive by default.  If you wish for your address to be visible when someone searches for your username, and click ""Update Address"".  Only one address may be active at a time.

If you're going on vacation, you will not be visible in the Search function.

Just to recap:

* Go here: http://rcigars.whileone.com
* You don't need that PIN you got previously
* You have to mark your address as active to show up on the search
* You can hide your address by marking it as inactive

Finally, go back to http://rcigars.whileone.com .  It can take a few seconds to start up.  If this doesn't resolve the issue, or you find any other issues, please send me a PM.  Thanks!",[BOOM!],False,self,False,t3_1hyfjt

----

**What is a Build'A'Humidor Giveaway?**
----

Essentially, and after the giveaway is over, we will randomly select two winners to receive a humidor filled with cigars that you sent in - a pseudo-lottery.

While one humidor will be a 50 count desktop that I am providing

----

**Cigars as entries**
----

There will be a possibility of receiving 15 entries.  You will be able to send in a maximum of five cigars

- $5-$10 cigars will be worth 1 entry

- $11 and up cigars will be worth 2 entries

- Anything that we determine to be very special/rare will be 3 entries

We will create a list of several brands that won't be allowed (i.e. Gurkha due to MSRP mark-up  and flavored due to tainting of humidor).

In order to stay as fair as possible

**IF YOU SEND CRACKED, DRY, GROSS, CIGAR/S** they will be tossed and not count as an entry - so make sure you ship them well (I suggest putting them in a baggy with a humidification pillow/pack, cushioning the inside of a small box).

----

**Extras**
----

- We will be allowing non-US members to join but they will need to cover any shipping expenses

- While you are free to send cigars from your humidor

- For non [+] members

- Mods are not eligible for entry

- Mods are not liable for **anything**


-----

Please leave suggestions below as we want this to run as smoothly as possible!  If you have any questions/comments/concerns leave them below and I will answer them as soon as possible.

Thanks!

/SAM

Starting at the top of your screen, and trade and bomb 'scores' for your account.  Under that is the Active Trades section.  Each trade is split up by color each with an Outbound and Inbound component (except bomb trades, which only have outbound).

Verified users may click on their trade partner's name to be directed to their address page.  **Unverified users must contact their trade partner to find out their address and discuss the specifics of the verification trade.**

After the sender and recipient columns, Bomb, or Blind Trade).  Bombs will have a trade code in parentheses that you are to include with your shipment so that your recipient can give you credit for your destruction.

Then you have shipment information.  If your partner has shipped

**Unless otherwise decided between the trade partners, and they put ""No Tracking"" or provide a tracking number that is invalid or nonexistent, please contact the mods.

Next is the received column.  Same as the shipped column, you will receive credit for the trade.  When both sides have marked as completed, the trade is done and will no longer show on the Active Trades window.  **If you have any issues with your trade, or receive an unacceptable package, click the Contact Mods link for the associated trade and enter a detailed message.**  We'll review complaints and come to a solution.

If you need to cancel your trade

* In all active trades other than Bomb trades
* You cannot cancel a Bomb trade that has already been shipped (why would you want to?).  Contact the mods if you have any issues.
* You cannot cancel out of a blind trade.

If your partner has requested to cancel the trade

Under the Active Trades screen you have Pending Trades (requests that you have sent out) and Trade Requests (requests that have been sent to you).  You can accept or deny trade requests

At the bottom are your navigation links, and enter a trade code for a bomb trade you have received.

But what I will do is tell you what the CoTM(s) will be.

Yes, but we have a primarily domestic reach.  If I wanted to nominate a Cuban cigar for CoTM, it would not be fair to US residents because they would have to import them illegally.  And likewise, it would not be fair to people outside the US because they do not have easy access to these cigars.  And since this is my show....

For US residents, and isn't made by some boutique that releases 5 cigars a decade.  It is a strong, flavorful, tasty cigar that deserves more respect than it has been given and is one of the best values on the market.

The international CoTM is the Romeo y Julieta Cazadores.   It is one of my go-to cigars when I want that Cuban profile but don't want to be lulled to sleep by Cuban tobacco's comparative mildness.
