 I love archery. I love people who love archery. I love that the sport is getting more popular

Archery is a great sport.

If your kids want to learn archery

If *you* don't know archery

I'm not yelling at your kids becaue I'm mean. I'm yelling at your kids because they're running behind the targets while other archers are firing. Sure, but *you* don't know that.

No

I don't carry around spare nock points

You have abdicated your duties as a responsible parent and handed your child a weapon with no knowledge or instructions on how to use it. I'm picking up the slack.

Stop. Take a moment. Think about what you're doing and what you're allowing your children to do. For goodness sake

A concerned archer.

PS- Put a leash on your dog and don't let it poop in the field.

PPS- On second thought

*EDIT- Parents, or want to ignore my instructions, just get off the range and don't come back. Ignorance we can fix, but stupid isn't welcome. (thanks /u/thinkindude)",,False,self,1366709145.0,t3_1cuusj

1. Be sure that the arm is not fully locked out so the elbow is not pertruding. Its easy enough saying this but some good ways on how to do it:
 - start with the arm slightly bent before drawing and maintain a solid forward 'press' towards the target.
 - be sure that the bow shoulder isn't riding up

2. Be sure you are not over pushing with your front arm. A good way to know if you are is if your arrows constant fly left (right handed archer)

3. Remember to follow through with your shot

4. Bring you head (and thus your anchor) slightly infront of the chest.

5. Open the stances out slightly

6. Make sure you bow is set up properly. Twisted limbs or riser could be a factor.

Most importantly

I'm sure theres a load of other this I've missed but they're the main ones I can think of.

so the other day i took my compound bow to a bow shop because i had to have the string replaced. After they put the new string on, the new string had a different peep sight in it, which i was charged for, (they also didn't serve it) and i never got my old one back. I eventually took out the new one, put a different one in and remembered to serve it.

While i was at the shop, blah.... basically the entire visit could have been summarized with one sentence; ""everything on your bow is set up different than my bow, so i took the liberty of setting it up the way *I* shoot""

ive been shooting for 10 years. I tune my bow so that it shoots where i aim my pins, its what i love to do. I know im accurate as hell with my bow, and after i got it back home to shoot, i had to re tune everything and get it back to how i had it before.

Before I begin, you use your bone alignment and back muscles to support the weight of the bow rather than your bicep/shoulder/any other part of your body.  Doing otherwise may cause injuries, and I am not to be held responsible.

To start off, back stretches, core stretches, etc.  You never want to get into shooting with muscles that are tense.

The first exercise, is a drill for Endurance.  Proceed though your shot until you get to transfer(or anchor if you don't use the NTS), and hold it there for 30 seconds.  Then let down and rest for twice the time you held.  Do 5 of these, then rest for 5 minutes, and do another set.  This will build your endurance, but takes a while to complete.  If you can't hold for 30, do 25, or even 15.  Do what you can do without injuring yourself

The next exercise is called SPT 2, go back down to set-up, and go straight back to holding.  Essentially what you are doing is drawing the bow, letting down, drawing the bow, letting down.  Do this 10 times, rest for 30 seconds, rest, rest for 5 in between.

The final one is called SPT 3, and draw though your clicker by expanding, but don't shoot.  Expand through your clicker for 10 seconds, or expand for 10 seconds if you don't have a clicker, then let down.  Rest for 30, and do it again. 5 or 6 to a set, you decide how many sets.  I recommend at least 3.

If you do these 4-6 days a week, do what you can without injuring yourself.  The idea of these is to work the muscle, not to kill yourself.

Good luck with your training

I haven't tried the Intrepid bow


As others have mentioned in this thread, offering weights from 25# to 60#.

An excellent arrow for the basic Fuse Focus are the inexpensive aluminium Easton XX75.  You can usually get a dozen with field tips and fletching for about $90.  I got mine from a locally owned archery store.  If you don't have a shop nearby dedicated to archery


Now that you've got a bow and arrows,cf.osb&amp;fp=3e2c363e3ac37794&amp;ion=1&amp;biw=1536&amp;bih=824).  It's what I have and I just leave it outside, and maybe remember to cover it up with the tarp I have hanging over the chain link fence behind it if it looks like rain.  It's stuffed with recycled plastic shopping bags, so you could DIY it possibly.

Alternative DIY targets are often made out of old carpet


I recommend taking one or two classes to get your form right at the beginning.  You can then perfect it in your backyard in your leisure time.


I personally prefer instinctive archery, the better your aim got.  You looked at the target, threw it, and watched how the ball flew.  Instinctive archery is the same thing, except you use less effort since the bow does most of the work for you.


I hope this helpful to somebody.  If I can answer any questions,False,self,t5_2r256,1339908800.0,,,t3_v5t54

This is basically just a discussion post, I've been instinctive shooting traditional bows my whole life. I think the first, last, and only time I ever touched a compound was when I was maybe 5 or 6. 

Anyways, it's almost as if I can see a red streaming arc(like this http://www.ziplineinteractive.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/red_arc_music_logo.png) from me to my target, and that's how I shoot. But I don't see the arc because of a sight picture or anything. I can hold my arms as if I'm shooting my bow and see the arc of the imaginary arrow perfectly. I dunno, I guess it's because I've shot so many arrows in my life.

So my question is, or instinctive, but even most instinctive still use their sight picture as a reference. But I'm talking about just from the feeling in your hands and arms, being able to perfectly see the arc of the arrow hitting the target. Anyways thanks.",,False,self,1375247136.0,t3_1jeavy

Are there any other Freemen on here? Interested to know and I think I'll definitely be taking up archery now!

Then I started to hear a sound that makes me cringe every time I hear it; the sound of a dry-fire. If it had just been one,  I started keeping a closer eye on them.

The bow was obviously too much for one of them to handle since he couldn't get a full draw. His friend would then step in and put his arm *through the string* to push his friend's arm back to a full draw.

I pretended to be curious and ask about their draw weight and how long they've been shooting. The answers were ""Um, whatever little girl."" eye roll and called my recurve ""cute"".

I don't so much care that they were being patronizing, but to those around them. The range is in a public park with no one to oversee, so it's a 'shoot at your own risk' kind of place. Archers are left to themselves to abide (or not) by range etiquette and these guys are an accident waiting to happen.

Also


My shots are now much more enjoyable! 

* thanks to the correct form I no longer get slap at all
* thanks to the correct form it is easier to aim
* thanks to the tab my fingers are not bruised and aching after an hour of shooting

I'm only still in the dark regarding how to gauge arrow drop (shooting at long distances) but i'm guessing that when shooting instinctively it's just a matter of getting more and more (and more) practice.

Good luck and have fun shooting!

The specialty store also sat with me and let me shoot a good amount of their arrows to find my size as well as giving me shooting tips. They even invited me back for free lessons.

My interest waned during the last decade or so but recently I've been looking for an outdoor hobby to take me away from my desk job and otherwise indoor lifestyle, the [inclusion of a crossbow in Call of Duty: Black Ops](http://callofduty.wikia.com/wiki/Crossbow), to name a few. As matter of fact


I just finished the second season of The Walking Dead (awesome show by the way), then it got me thinking about bows and crossbows in general and how they would perform in an apocalyptic/survival type scenario where resources are scarce and your very livelihood and survival may depend on them. I'm not the most knowledgeable person where it comes to bows and crossbows, but these are some of the questions and concerns that came to mind for this type of scenario.


Looking at compound bows

**Structure / Durability**

* How much punishment can it take via dropping

* Would a modern compound bow made with the latest and greatest materials be more or less susceptible to damage than a wooden recurve or longbow?

* Similarly

* What would be the best/most durable/most reliable material for a bow or crossbow in this scenario?

* Should other factors be considered other than durability such as weight or susceptibility to high/low/varying temperatures?

* All said and done

* How difficult would it be to fashion a complete bow or crossbow out of wood or other common materials?

**Making Repairs**

* How easy it is to fashion replacement parts out of easily accessible resources?

* How difficult would it be to make repairs with only common or readily available tools?

**Strings**

* What common materials could be used to maintain the strings?

* Would it be possible to fashion replacement strings using common materials or materials readily found in nature?

* Would it be more difficult to restring a bow or a crossbow using field equipment only?
	
**Ammunition** (arrows/bolts)

* Could you craft replacement arrows or bolts out of tree branches and/or other readily available materials?

* Would this hand-crafted replacement ammunition be as-or-nearly as effective as modern manufactured arrows or bolts?

* Would arrows or bolts have any particular advantages in this respect?
	
**Effectiveness**

* Would a bow or crossbow the more effective for hunting or self-defense?

* In self-defense, so it may even itself out.*

* Would there be a significant accuracy difference between high-quality modern ammunition and hand-crafted replacement ammunition fashioned out of wood or other common materials?

* What would be the ideal bow or crossbow for hunting?

* What would be the ideal bow or crossbow for self-defense?

**Unique Advantages**

* Are there any unique advantages that a compound bow

* Are there any unique advantages that a bow would give you over a crossbow

* Are there any unique advantages that a bow or crossbow would have over a traditional firearm? (pistol

Hey everyone
I got the go ahead from RugerRedhawk, but remember this is for noobs, so try not to overwhelm your reader. If your contribution makes the cut, I'll be putting in a list of contributors as well. Feel free to copy and paste any advice you wrote from one of the many first bow threads.

[SAFETY FIRST!! Read this.](http://users.ox.ac.uk/~archery/docs/range_safety.pdf)

**1) I want to get into archery - what should I do?**

Find your closest archery club and sign up for a class. Archery is not necessarily the cheapest sport in the world

**2) Alright

For compound bows

For recurves


**3) What should my Draw weight be?**

Always always always always start with a lower draw weight. Period. End of story.

That being said, the distance between the arrow rest and your anchor point). The weight on most limbs is determined with a draw length of 28 inches. If your draw length is over 28 inches, you will end up pulling a much higher weight. For example, I have a 30.5 inch draw length and 36 pound limbs, but I end up drawing closer to 42 pounds. Another factor is bow length. If you're shooting with a 62"" bow versus, say, a 68"" bow, you'll need a different set of arrows for each set of limbs. Arrows for a 25 pound bow won't be stiff enough for use with the 40 or 60 pound limbs

Once you have all the technical stuff squared away, honestly, if you can't comfortably draw back the bow, you have no business shooting a set of limbs that heavy.

My advice? Get yourself a set of 25-30 pound limbs and really develop a monster form. After that

*Written by [SonicSemae](http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/vke5b/draw_weights_when_is_it_just_silly/c55awld)*

**4) What should my arrow length be?**
Draw length + 3/4"". See question 2 for how to figure out your draw length.

**5) Where can I get a good bow from?**
There are lots of places to check out. Your local archery store is probably best because the people there can stop you from making any foolish mistakes. You can also check out several archery forums on the web

1. Obviously a bow. I would like to use a recurve since it's the most traditional

2. Arrows. Do I buy all the pieces (shaft, or can you buy them already assembled? Does ""per [x]"" mean ""this many come in the package,"" as found in [this link](http://www.cabelas.com/product/Hunting/Archery/Arrows-Shafts/Carbon%7C/pc/104791680/c/104693580/sc/104192280/i/103856580/Cabelas-Carbon-Hunter-with-434-AAE-Vanes-150-Per-6/744967.uts?destination=%2Fcatalog%2Fbrowse%2Fhunting-archery-arrows-shafts-carbon%2F_%2FN-1100022%2FNs-CATEGORY_SEQ_103856580%3FWTz_l%3DSBC%253BMMcat104791680%253Bcat104693580%253Bcat104192280&amp;WTz_l=SBC%3BMMcat104791680%3Bcat104693580%3Bcat104192280%3Bcat103856580)? Is there a certain kind of tip you should use for target shooting?

3. Quiver: Any suggestions? I won't be hunting (right away

4. Anything else? Do I need a fancy release mechanism, or anything else? Dumb question: Is there something already on the bow that you can rest an arrow on, or do you have to buy a rest?

I'd like to share a little bit as to why I decided to take up the bow.  

So I went hunting for the first time this year, an iPhone, and a Remington 700.  The place that I was at was a beautiful plot of about 50 acres of private land with several deer blinds, none as luxurious as the one I ended up in.  They bait all year round, and had already pulled three deer out of the property this season.

So on the first day out, she's broadside to me, giving me a perfect shot and I'm a damn good shot.  I line it up as she stands there eating, none the wiser.  I begin controlling my breathing, calming my adrenaline laced body.  Ten seconds, twenty, thirty, and I'm just watching her eat through my scope.  Two minutes, continues breathing. 

Surprisingly my mind isn't racing, she couldn't have made it any easier for me to shoot her.  Three minutes... I could have shot her ten times by now but something just doesn't feel right about it.  All this time, I'm trying to put it together in my mind, why does this feel so off?

Then for the briefest moment

La Grunta.

(Relevant:  http://kingofthehill.wikia.com/wiki/Good_Hill_Hunting )

Suddenly I realized that was it.  This felt cheap.  It felt handed to me.  I felt like I was stealing this animal's life

I picked up my rifle

I'm not an entirely spiritual person, to get food to feed my family else we go without, I wouldn't care if I killed that thing with a hand grenade.  But that's not where I'm at, and I feel like maybe in this case, I should be playing with a handicap.

The next day I packed up my stuff and went home early (not to mention I'd come down with Bronchitis)  and decided that if I'm going to hunt

Since then I've watched so many videos on archery, and begun practicing at the range.

Last week I finally purchased a used BowTech Mighty Mite compound bow and took it to get sized and tuned.  Took it out to the range and sighted it in.  Two days later

If you managed to read all of that

tl;dr - went hunting with a rifle

I have noticed that a lot of us FITA Recurve/Olympic Recurve shooters like the Horizon and recommend it to archers interested in recurve.

I have shot the bow

The SF Riser is $10 more

First of all, you will get forces that are not propelling the arrow forward, but left and right.  This causes the arrow to behave differently and introduces lateral error every shot.  This will cause excessive vibrations and absorb energy that should be going into the arrow.

With the Horizon's system

Now my second point - the lack of secondary stabilization holes.  This limits the customization that an archer has over his/her equipment.  Without access to the two secondary stabilization holes

These details may seem minor for a beginning or even an intermediate archer

When I was a kid, I'm right handed, though I can do just about any task left handed as well. 

The first test I did for eye dominance, small object in the middle of it, and then closed each eye one at a time and found myself to be left eye dominant. For that reason, I figured I should shoot left handed. 

Then

So then I thought, so I found this test:

1.  Extend your arms in front of you with your palms facing away.

2. Bring your hands together

3.  Choose a small object about 15-20 feet away from you. With both eyes open

4.  Close one eye and then the other. When you close one eye

5.  If the object does not move when you cover one eye

Here's the problem I'm having

What the hell? Is this normal? Do other people have this same issue? Since using a bow will be a new skill to me

I'm also wondering if used, because of the lesser demand for it. Maybe not since the supply is probably less too? I dunno?

Is there anything I can do to resolve this wonky eye dominance thing? Is it even a thing? Wear an eye patch like a pirate? Electroshock therapy? Secret voodoo ceremonies? Haaaalp!


TL;DR Eye dominance test right handed = left eye dominant
          Eye dominance test left handed = right eye dominant
          How in the hell?

EDIT: I found out that I may be part of the population that has no eye dominance. I didn't even know that this was a thing until today. I've found different articles on the internet that claim anywhere between 1% and 15% of the population have no eye dominance.",self,t5_2r256,1367331439.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/1del2h/determining_eye_dominance_im_having_trouble_with/

What I know so far and my related questions:

* I want to go au natural and start with something not compound. Something just seems more appealing about a simple bow. I see that longbows are different than recurve bows

* Any specific models I should consider to get started? I'm not rich

* The archery store I mentioned earlier seems to be the only range in the area. I'd like to practice there (and they offer lessons)

* What alternatives can I arrange to practice? The range is a bit of a drive

* In case this matters to the equipment you'll recommend, I won't rule out joining a club or competition shooting.

Thanks for your help and advice! 

UPDATE: I took another trip out to the local store/range today and they happily let me try a few bows and talked me through some basics. I shot a really basic black deal with only a 15# draw for 10-15 shots. I felt like it was really easy to draw, but I seemed to do worse than I had with the lighter bow. Then again, my arms were not used to this, so I'm sure running another 10-15 shots was going to be harder than when I started. According to the catalog, I can get the Razorback in 20, 25, 30

I used 5/8"" all thread (the bars with threads on them) and some washers and nuts. Four each of washers and bolts and two 2' pieces of all thread came to around ten dollars. I had the wood already

Sorry for the lack of update guys

First off, after two weeks of going to the range, my wife and I have yet to shoot a single arrow. We were given 22# and 27# bows and were told that we would be training for at least one month before we ever got to shoot an arrow. And it makes sense why. The bows they normally shoot with are at least 45-50#s. No way we can pull that on day one and even if you had experience with western archery, the draw is completely different.

**The Draw:** The bow is short, the more the poundage builds on itself, and seeing how far we pull back, it is difficult to hold the draw. The draw itself doesn’t stop in front of your face, but past your ear almost to your shoulder. Not only that but your bow arm is pushed straight out. If you had  a normal recurve and you shot with this bow arm, you’d have welts on your forearm. (Though I’ve seen how people release, because I have no experience with it myself, the anchor is set on your chin and lips. However

**TL;DR:** The draw comes all the way back past the ear. The anchor is set on the pectoral and side of your head.

**The Targets:** It may be difficult to judge the distance to the targets in the pictures, we’ll take proper pictures to show size.) In the center of the target there is a large red circle. This circle is mic’ed from what I can tell because every time a shooter hits a target, the speakers from where the shooters are shooting from clang. It is a definite somewhat metallic clank because when the arrow hits any other part of the target, it’s a soft clunk.

The distance from where shooters shoot to the target is probably the reason why we’re training on bows for a month. There are no close targets. When we’re ready to shoot, that’s for sure. 

**TL;DR:** The targets are big and at least 100 yds away.

**The Thumb Ring:** Just recently, we were given the thumb ring (after a 60,000 won deposit for the both of us) and given sand paper. A little confused at first, we were told in broken English that we would need to make the thumb rings smooth. 

The feeling I had when we were told to make our thumb rings smooth was… for a lack of a better term was awe. Literal awe. Amazed that I was going to put my own work into something I was going to use. Frightened that I was going to fuck it up. (I’m sure if you’ve made your own arrows

**TL;DR:** We get to smooth our own thumb rings after they were fitted. So awesome!

Well

Keep shooting r/archery!

I've been shooting recurve for a few months

I grabbed one of their longbows and shot a few. You can say I was hooked

So here are my questions:

* What are the main differences in shooting a recurve vs longbow? What specific things do you look for in a longbow? My experience has only been with light olympic recurves.

* Is there a certain brand and model that is recommended to start with?

Any assist would be greatly appreciated.",self,t5_2r256,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Archery/comments/16dith/longbow_questions/
