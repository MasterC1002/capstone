As of late I've started to theorize about what a diet would look like that placed emphasis on mental/emotional well-being before any physical pay off (weight loss

Obviously physical well-being and mental health are not exactly seperate entities but your hard pressed to find diets that value cognition over chiseled abs. So the question I pose is this...

What foods, supplements et cetera.. would you include in a theoretical diet that disregards the physique in the interest of cognition and emotional well-being.

To clarify

So I'm curious. What would your theoretical ""brain"" diet look like.

Mine (thus far) looks like this:

-Lower calorie intake (1400-1700)
-Intermittent Fasting (one large meal a day)
-Run/Jog about 30 miles a week or more.
-No refined sugar
-No soy or chocolate (I am allergic/intolerant)
-Minimal table salt (celtic sea salt is fine)
-Lots of kale, peppers and chili's and celery. Almonds, cashews, coconut milk/cream (unsweetened), seaweed and nutritional yeast. Hemp protein and brown rice protein (both plain unflavored).
-drinking water and coffee only
-spicing everything with lots of black pepper, coriander, cinnamon, dill, cardamon, chili pepper, basil, oregeno
-Supplement with Omega 3 (fish oil), Glycine, Glutamine (optional not constant), b-vitamins (mostly 6, 12 and 1) and DLPA.

Bear in mind this is MY theoretical ""brain"" diet. I don't suggest this for anyone else, never feel physicall or mentally drained, and as a bonus I've lost weight.",,False,self,t5_2qoox,,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1e81bo/a_diet_for_the_brain_first_not_the_body/
1367805697.0,1drm6f,Tip for eating massive amounts of leafy greens,MaybiusStrip,80,14,28,"I'm a big believer in the power of eating plants. I try to make large quantities of leafy greens a staple in my diet. 

I get tired of the texture pretty quickly, here's an awesome solution: Indian style ""saag""!

Recipe

1. Purchase half a shopping cart of spinach, but I find it tastes bitter and I've been told freshness is a big factor in the taste of kale and chard). 

2. chop up a head of garlic and fry it up in some grass-fed butter. 

3. Throw all the greens in there with a bit of water and steam the shit out of them (kill the bacteria).

4. Take an immersion blender/blender/food processor and pulverize those poor plants. I like the immersion blender myself because it's super easy to clean.

5. Add cumin, smoked paprika (put it on everything, trust me), and salt to taste. You can go pretty heavy handed on these, especially the cumin. 

6. Profit. Your shitload-a-greens probably cooked down to a much smaller volume of delicious ""saag"". You can go all out and throw some paneer in there

1360639510.0,18cs0m,A Note on Calories and A Common Misconception,dannyp123,100,36,102,"I've noticed in a few comments that the idea that caloric intake is a substantial determinant in body composition is being cited. I just wanted to take the time to talk about how diet effects body composition

First off, bones, water). 

The prevalent idea is that an excess intake of calories

Calories are a unit of energy and *not* a nutrient, fat which is essentially a long string of carbons with hydrogens attached to them. 

Now onto the good stuff...

When you eat food, carbs), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) and other chemicals (phytochemicals, antioxidants, polyphenols and many more). Macronutrients contain Calories in the sense that our bodies can manipulate their chemical structure to release energy that we can use to do work (in the physical sense).

Eating food which contains calories (pretty much anything obviously) causes those ""calories"" to go somewhere. The calories don't physically *go* anywhere

Let's use a banana to exemplify this. A banana contains the majority of it's calories in carbohydrates. Eating the banana

*mobilized for energy (we'll rule this out

*stored as glycogen (a glucose polymer) in the muscles or liver to be used later

*stored in another form, with other substances being required to do this

The point to this is that this banana, with fat accumulation being only one of those possibilites. What determines how these calories will be stored is more a matter of hormonal regulation than of simple caloric intake.

Certain foods have a propensity to leave their calories distributed one way or another; soda will likely cause an increase in body fat due to the hormonal involvement that results from drinking soda. Taking in an excess 250 calories of soda (sugar) will likely make you fat. Taking in excess 250 calories of something nutrient dense, however if you are an active person (but not so active as to create calorie balance or a calorie deficit) those 250 calories from the egg will be more likely to going to a process like protein synthesis than the sugar from the soda.

One last quick example. Think of a kid going through puberty. He can take in a significant amount of calories more than he burns and not get fat. These calories are used not to make more fat, they just go there if you have no reason to do anything else with them (you sit around on the couch all day) or you eat unhealthy food that is chemically designed to be stored as fat.

I seem to have hit a plateau

So I can't be the only one who has had this problem. How do others cope? Especially people with strong addictive tendencies?

In early March I got more serious about diet (and exercise), started EC on a weekly cycle - and the pounds just fell off.

Over the last several weeks, but also binging pretty hard on basically pure sugar, usually at night. Chocolate chips, cake frosting, cookies or pie if we have any. I like the idea of chocolate chips because they are small and measureable. 4 dozen of them isn't even 100 calories. But I end up taking handful after handful. And every time I give in it's easier to give in again leading to nasty cycles.

I try to substitute fruit, maybe with a few nuts or croutons, and olive oil &amp; balsamic vinegar for dressing followed by some fruit, whatever we had on hand, strawberries or blueberries or an apple or pineapple. But now that's its more into summer both the salad and the fruit spoil so quickly that we often don't have any fresh salad or fruit. Plus, a lot of times lately I just skip the fruit and think oh just a little chocolate to scratch that itch.

I feel a little out of control because I have some strong motivations to drop another 10-15 lbs but I just keep giving in and it's super reminiscent of how I've abused mood altering substances, by overeating sweets and failing to be physically active (desk job doesn't help) as the months added up to years until I was in my 30's and creeping up on 250 (for a guy who couldn't break 200 if he tried, until my late 20's anyway).

This is at least partly just to vent, but I would never, ever touch either of those things again and feel I have full conscious control over that. But when it comes to something more nebulously harmful like sugar, or, say, pot, I fall into this dependency-like cycle. And there's probably a dozen other contributing factors: I constantly procrastinate really, still have some substance issues also leading to stress and depression, etc.,self

Tips for Healthy Snacking
1. Design your snacks like mini-meals. Include protein
2. Resist the urge to snack when you are bored or stressed. Try going for a walk or reading a book to get your mind off of food.
3. Don't snack in front of the TV. This leads to mindless eating and lack of portion control.
4. If you are one to eat from the chip/pretzel bag
5. Make snacking interesting! Try something new and different (like macadamia nuts or avocado slices).

Tips for Snacking On-The-Go
1. Pack your snack the night before
2. Remember to read the nutrition label. Sugar should not be one of the first 4 ingredients!

&gt;A fundamental flaw in Rhinehart's plan is his assumption that the human body needs only chemicals and elements to survive.

* It is aware of maximum amounts of nutrients that may be harmful and will not exceed them

* It can maximize and minimize specific nutrients

* It has a function to easily replace an item in the diet

I am 21 years old

My eating habits are pretty tame. I eat home-cooked meals all the time. I rarely eat at restaurants, fries, milkshakes, pancakes, etc. I never drink soda or juice, only water. 

My family is Indian, and wheat bread daily. The only meat I eat is chicken and sometimes fish.

Here is my problem. I never get hungry and become full very fast. **I have tried following much of the advice on this sub, I go the whole day without eating and don't realize I'm hungry until I see my hands start to shake.

I don't eat breakfast because I have to save space lunch so I will have some energy throughout the rest of the day. I usually eat a sandwich or a bowl of rice around 12 or 1 pm, cucumbers, or similar foods with lots of water.

For some reason, fruits, and drinks for lunch; and then eat a steak, potatoes, and pie for dinner. All of those would be about 3 days' meal for me. Quite frankly, food just doesn't interest me. If it's there, sure, no problem

For the past month or so, and I've recorded my routes a few times and looked up the total distance traveled, and I usually walk 3-4 miles a day just by being on campus. I tried jogging in the gym last week but blacked out after just a quarter of a mile, and this is one of the reasons I need to fix up my diet, so I can start exercising more.

Microwaving

There is a lot of debating going on over microwaving vs. using a conventional oven. Some say microwaving is the devil because of nutrient loss and cancer causing properties. Some nutrients are broken down when they are exposed to heat. So, it is a slightly better option than cooking in the oven. 

Frying

Frying is probably one of the worst ways to cook your vegetables. The heat is so high that almost all nutrients are immediately destroyed.  Frying also causes the release of free radicals

Boiling

Boiling is probably the second worst way to cook your vegetables, you are not getting the benefits of the cancer fighting properties they hold.

Steaming

Steaming is the gold standard for cooking vegetables. Steaming helps to retain the nutritional value of your vegetables. Some key things to remember when steaming are: don't use too much water (1/2 cup is usually good) and don't overcook (5-7 minutes is usually good for most vegetables).

Raw Food 

Just to clarify, not the raw food diet, where a person will only eat raw foods (no meats, fish, etc). Studies have shown that both raw and cooked vegetable consumption are inversely related to epithelial cancers, lung cancer, and breast cancer; however

Degradation of Vitamins &amp; Minerals

Once vegetables are picked, many vitamins are easily destroyed by oxygen. In order to minimize nutrient loss, cut vegetables should be stored in airtight containers in the refrigerator. Just to keep in mind, after about 24 hours in the fridge, cooked vegetables will lose 1/4 of their Vitamin C content. Vitamin C is the most likely vitamin to be lost in cooking. It is very sensitive to heat, air, and water. To minimize nutrient loss

Before I ask my question

So about a year ago I decided to change, 375 pounds, unhealthy as hell, and had bigger breasts than most women did (I'm a dude). Since early January of last year, I managed to drop my weight down to 265, on nothing other than running and doing some weight training, and eating smaller portions and limiting myself to a 2, I am completely ignorant on the facts of nutrition

That being said, my ass has never been kicked so hard. To my surprise, I've been able actually make it through the majority of the workouts, maybe not at the pace of most, but I am able. I dig deep and push through. I've also dropped my weight to 262 since I started, and I can see the changes in the mirror, my body is getting more toned and my fat is starting to shift to different places, I have ankles now!

Part of my problem in life is that I am a insanely picky eater, protein shakes, and on rare occasions I like to cook a small sirloin. With that in mind, I am human, and if I do not cheat on my diet I'll literally go insane, no pun intended. I LOVE pizza, I LOVE pasta

Now onto my question. Since i'm completely ignorant when it comes to nutrition, and consume a a total of 60 grams of fat, but I only burn 40 grams, will my weight not change? I know you have to burn more calories than you consume to lose weight, but I don't understand how fat works into the equation. Could someone shed some light onto this for me, preferably in a way a person with little knowledge of nutrition can understand?

About myself: 21 years old, but I'm looking to increase that, and I think that nutrition is a really big part of that. As of now, I really only eat one meal a day, and it's just something cheap like a frozen pizza or spaghetti.

I really want to eat 3 meals a day, but I don't want to buy expensive or unnecessary things.

So, balanced meal of the 3 sorts [breakfast, lunch, dinner]. I could just do the same thing every day, and that would be fine.

1375841420.0,1jusyu,Weight loss / healthier eating for someone with a lot of food hang ups do to a history of flirting with disordered eating,femmederqueer,24,2,9,"Hi!   I'm 20 years old

I've struggled a lot with my body and my self-esteem and all that.  I absolutely hated everything abut my body and myself because of it till I was like, I didn't have easy access to exercising, and a few months back at school I was too neurotic and fixed on my weight loss for it to be healthy for me to continue focusing on it.

Now I want to lose weight, I think).  I cut out all added sugar (and most added fake sugar) - things like sucrose, corn syrup, and anything ending in -ose that I feel shouldn't be there.  I'm also avoiding things that have concentrated amounts of naturally occurring sugars, like fruit juice (even if it doesn't have sucrose added) and dried fruits.  I get most of my sugar from frozen blueberries, milk, and probably grains - while I've cut out pasta (or at least DRASTICALLY cut back), rice cakes

I have no doubt that this will make me healthier, and feel in general less hungry all the time.  But I'm worried, for one, that my fat intake is too high.  Also I just feel like I'm not well informed on how to make nutritious choices.

SO here's where shit gets complicated. 
-I'm vegetarian!  No fish.  Eggs and milk, here's hoping it's available and affordable soon.
-I don't want to NEED to exercise - although I'm trying to get workout equipment for my apartment, that's 20 minutes of me chastising myself for being so fat and horrible and how the gym will never help me.
-I'm not going to weight myself!  Nope.  Knowing my weight fucks me up mentally.  I should be able to lose weight without it
-I need to be able to eat
~less importantly, and won't go bad if I don't eat it within a week.

The only things I really know are that I need protein and fiber.  I'm not saying I know I need more, but it's sweet while not being high in sugar, I can eat a lot of it, and I feel like there's a lot of protein in it.  Otherwise, I eat some frozen vegetables, buy tomatoes and grapes, and avocados when they're cheap enough

TL;DR what food should I make a staple of my diet that is vegetarian, and prep work is simplish.

This question has been bugging me for quite a long time now.
 
**TLDR : I’m wondering if there is any reason for why we count the energy balance (surplus / deficit) at the end of the day specifically VS for example over the course of a week.**


Is there any special mechanism that happens in the body when we go to sleep (hormones likely) that could account for this way of measuring ? I seem to recall having read somewhere that it should probably more actually be counted over a 24-hour span



***SIDENOTE*** : I’m actually asking this question in regards to (intermittent) fasting

My reasoning is the following : suppose I consume 80% of my TDEE in one meal at 9PM, I’m in a 40% surplus that should most likely cause the FFA to be esterified and stored as triglicerydes, shouldnt’it ?**

I suppose that the overall deficit would cause those newly formed triglycerides to be eventually oxydated

As some of you may have noticed

Before now, and little discussion. What we would like, and I'm sure what all of you would like, is to see this subreddit transform into a vibrant, helpful, thriving community where people can seek advice, useful information, such a transformation will take some work

I've identified three main objectives that I think will most effectively improve our community in all aspects:

* Increasing exposure and our subscriber count

* Creating a basic FAQ

* Inventing a community nickname - this one is more just for fun! r/fitness has Fittit

As far as increasing exposure goes, I will be gathering information that will form the foundation for the FAQ, and will be creating a specific post asking for suggestions for information to be included in the FAQ.

Most importantly, and immature bickering in comment threads. I've outline some guidelines in the sidebar, but I will reiterate them here:

* Follow proper [Reddiquette](http://www.reddit.com/help/reddiquette)! This is absolutely essential!

* This is not the place for posts about fitness

* Blogspam is our greatest enemy (and the world of nutrition is particularly ripe with blogspam). If you are going to submit an article, non-basic, from a reputable source (i.e. not a commercial website or blog [with some exceptions]), and that it says something that hasn't already been covered.

* If someone makes a self post requesting a critique of their diet, once developed, will be a great place to direct queries.

* **Nutrition is an inherently complicated field as much of it is contingent on how one defines ""health"". Please remember that not everybody has the same health goals as you, vegetarian, vegan, etc.). Keep this in mind when entering arguments in comment threads. Unlike many other more specialized subreddits, this is r/nutrition: discussion of all diets is welcome.**

Also, knowledgable, and helpful users to enlist! Also, if you're particularly interested, please feel free to [message us](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23nutrition).

The Study

Three high calorie diets were tested in a group of people between the ages of 18-35.  They had a BMI of 19-30

Group 1: “Low Protein”

    6% of calories from protein.
    42% of calories from carbs.
    52% of calories from fat.

Group 2: “Normal Protein”

    15% of calories from protein.
    41% carbs.
    44% fat.

Group 3: “High Protein”

    26% of calories from protein.
    41% of calories from carbs.
    33% of calories from fat.

Carbohydrates were kept the same for each group, as I wrote in this response to a NY Times piece which said the opposite of today’s Time Magazine piece.)

The subject’s body compositions were measured with DEXA scans twice a week.  DEXA scans are the most accurate method to date for determining body composition (hats off to the researchers for doing it right).  Resting energy expenditure and total energy expenditure were measured throughout the study

The low protein group gained almost half the weight of the other groups.

Total Weight Gain

Low Protein (5%): 3.16 kilograms.

Medium Protein (15%): 6.05 kilograms.

High Protein (25%): 6.51 kilograms.

Good golly. The headline says that the only thing that matters is how much you eat

According to the headline, then saying “…it’s about the calories, stupid” is a blatant misinterpretation (not to mention, a little insulting).

History. I've always been thin. My mom was extremely thin up until menopause (she was a yoga instructor with an 8-pack when she was 40)

Me: I'm currently 6'3"", but I'm not a couch potato and am fixing something or going somewhere every weekend. 

My main problem is I have a very small appetite. When I wake up I don't feel hungry

When I eat, after a filet mignon and smashed potatoes dinner, my girlfriend guilted me into eating half a chocolat lava cake (it was my birthday and the cake showed up unannounced), mixing that in with the half bottle of wine I'd had, I actually had to leave the table to get sick. 

My appetite seems to be programmed to kick in later in the day

I also have anxiety about eating out. I don't eat as quickly as most people

I haven't always been quite this skinny. When I was in college I weighed about 150lbs (and was concerned about it then as well) and when I worked during the summers, my appetite has dwindled, and nothing I do seems to have a noticeable effect. 

I recently went to my doctor for a full, and to just eat more food and don't get low fat anything if I want to gain weight. 

Lately I've become more concerned, I have a personal career coach, and she suggested that if I want to be more productive at work, I need to lock down a healthy, brain-stimulating diet. 

As such, but I'm bad about remembering to take it when I eat, trying to make that a habit as well. 

To get an idea of my diet, cheese and peppers in it. I managed to eat about 3/4 of it before I got my ""blech, don't eat anymore or you're going to feel sick"" feeling. Then for lunch I had a big nacho salad thing they do on fridays, which I picked at until it was basically salsa, guac and chips left which I couldnt squeeze in after the rest. Then as I was typing this I had a toasted coconut donut I got for free at Dunkin this morning. I don't usually have an afternoon snack. Not sure what dinner will be yet, last night we had mushroom stuffed rigatoni and the night before I had two enormous ghetto shrimp po-boys. (frozen shrimp, arnold bread, relish

So.... what else can I do? What kind of foods should I be eating to maximize how much of it sticks? Is there anything I can do to stimulate my appetite

I've had conversations with people that have told me how much they love eating. They wake up every day looking forward to what meals may come

Case in point - the cheeseburger or the burrito. Eating this way for every meal turns you into a porker. But, it seems that numerous people have seen positive results. So it seems that where the two nutrition sources meet in the middle is where we run into issues.

1343412191.0,x9aza,Tube Feeding - A New Weight Loss Low,bmysz1121,22,8,8,"I just read on Forbes that there is a new weight loss strategy for rapid fat loss and it involves tube feeding – through the nose. Yes
 
 
 
I don’t know about you
 
1) A tube up the nose? Are you serious? This is typically reserved for those who have terminal illnesses or are extremely ill and are unable to swallow. Basically what is fed through this tube is a no carb solution with an allotted 800 calories per day. Can’t you just eat 800 calories per day (through your mouth)
 

Imagine someone putting a tube down your nose into your stomach! That would be extremely uncomfortable - and what would you really get out of this?
 
2) This creates a completely different attitude towards weight loss. Dr. David L. Katz, of Yale University states that this creates a “means to an end” attitude in which we no longer focus on the healthiest way of weight loss, but we are now looking at the fastest way to produce results – which typically means it is unhealthy. This attitude will open a whole new window of weight loss techniques that are incredibly unhealthy.
 

I'm going to open my own weight loss clinic. I will put a shock collar on all of my patients, and the smell of the dead fish will be associated with putting food to their mouth. They won't eat again! It's flawless! It's a perfect weight loss plan for anyone needing assistance with starving themselves to induce weight loss.
 
3) This diet “works” by putting your body in a state of ketosis. Ketosis is induced when your body runs out of glycogen stores (glycogen stores are created through ingestion of carbohydrates, which are acidic and create a pH imbalance in your body. Your kidneys have to work extra hard to keep your pH normal during this process. I am assuming that a doctor has to perform this procedure to monitor your kidney and liver function because of the strain this diet puts on your body. Now, do you really think a diet that can potentially hurt your kidneys and liver is really a good idea?
 
4) If your body was put through this type of diet for a longer period of time, then this “diet” can only last 10 days. The body is an incredible adaptation machine, and the more rapidly you lose weight, the more rapidly the body will adjust, and counter the weight loss. So basically, you will gain the weight back unless you stay in that state of ketosis longer which, as discussed
 
5) I am no doctor
 
Im sure you have heard of a lot of different crash diets, and they do not understand this. This attitude towards weight loss needs to be stopped.
 

Who knows what type of diet will they think of next?

Size your portions. The biggest errors i see in peoples diet (used to do the same) - big portions. A meat portion is 100-200g (1/4-1/2 pounds) tops. The less bone

Get a ""fish day"" 1 day of fish per week will vary your meals a lot.

Plan your meals. Breakfast in the morning (get fruits and something warm - any kind of oats, couscous salad, homemade potato salad, etc.) Something hearty for supper - soup or ragout.

Incorporate vegies in you meals - Chicken noodle soop? Add some onions and greens (parsley, put tons of mushrooms, peppers and cut on the pepperoni. Lasagna? Less meat, get some eggplants and zucchinis in there. Be creative.

Start cooking. STOP BUYING FROZEN PREMADE FOOD. JUST STOP. Start  exploring different cuisines. A good tool to start cooking - is ingredient of the week section. It lets you discover new recipes and expand your horizons. Didnt like it
Has a section like that.

Shop at the local fruit stores. Find a good place with a good selection and some organic sections. Local markets are amazing too. Supporting local farmers also gets you better food. Fruits from further away are preserved with wax and chemicals. No matter how much harmful they are for you its never a good thing.

Best tip if you want to loose weight fast - drink water and only water for a month, they loose a lot of nutrients after 30 minutes. So 1 portion of a time. Its excellent if you do this, but its a lot of work, and I mostly stay on store juices myself.

Fruit smoothies is an easy snack

I'm currently 165 (down from 215 a year ago) and I would love to stay this size while converting my remaining fat to lean mass.

Background information: Long term (35 years)  of blood pressure medication, recently had a stent put in for reported 95% blockage in ""widow-maker"" artery. 6 foot, 235. Unable to take cholesteral medication. Obviously very concerned about health and longevity. 

He has tried exercise, he eats about the same but this is obviously not working for him.

My current schedule is running 3 times a week (5-12k a time - tend to build up to half marathons as the months go on then pull it back towards race days), as well as ab ripper twice a week, weight training (lunges/squats/pull ups/chin ups and more) twice a week. I'll also be taking up kickboxing shortly - more on the martial arts side, than the quasi cardio stuff though. That'll be once a week.

Diet wise

Breakfast: Special K with blueberries / or boiled egg, splash of milk and two strawberries or blueberries

Morning snack: little bit of melon or clementine

Lunch: wholemeal roll w/ tuna

Afternoon snack: clementine &amp; apple if heading out for a run

Dinner: varies between low-carb recipes (little bit of bacon &amp; broccoli

Evening snack: slice of soreen and a banana on long run days

I have cheat days

Weight:97-98.5lbs / Height: 5""0

Hey Guys. My name is Nick. Very nice to meet you. I'm choosing to spend my lunchtime today writing looking for some information on eating. I'll tell you where I used to be

I'd say this time 2 years ago, And I would eat 1 sub and at least 4 mcdoubles (with fries and drinks) a day. The daily commute left me no time to go grocery shopping and cook, so I never did. Because I was on my feet all day long, I was constantly up and at em'. I was nicely toned and had the 'skinny white boy six pack' you get when you don't even work out but you look good. 

Well that phase is over. I'm 22 years old now, I pick up fruits, veggies, chicken, and fish. Those are the main four things that I pick up. I haven't gotten a gym membership yet because I might be moving a half hour away from my current location, so I don't want to start any contracts. 

I now weigh about 180 pounds. I was at 185 a few weeks ago, cookies, and junk foods in my house. Got rid of all the candy, and anything else that wasn't healthy. No pop, and i buy a 30 pack of water every time i go grocery shopping.  I lost 9lb's since Christmas when I weighed myself a few weeks ago. I think i'm about at 183 now. That's with no exercise. 

Basically what I'm looking for is some guidance. I think I'm eating well (especially when you compare me to my group of friends and how much junk food they eat) but I think I could be eating better. I'm not sure how much of something (like sodium) I should have in a day

I had to skip breakfast because I woke up late, I finished off my bag of sugar peas, along with a mango and a bottle of water. Now I would have had that mac and cheese to eat, but I polished that off because I didn't have my raisin bran for breakfast like I usually do. Now when I get home later, I'm going to fry up some chicken which i usually just season with chicken rub seasoning and some citrus seasoning. I'll have some more fruit and veggies, and then call it a day. 

The things I usually buy are grapefruits, red orange and green peppers, cucumbers, carrots, peas, mushrooms, chicken, some microwave dinners I use for sides in meals, bread, etc. etc. 

So I guess my main question is this. Am I doing well? I know I'm not going to lose much more weight without exercising, but its usually Jimmy Johns or Chipolte. One concern I have is the veggie dip. It's hard for me to eat certain veggies without anything to dip them in. I don't go crazy and scoop out half the container for one bite...but just enough to enhance the flavor of the vegetable. Is that completely defeating the purpose?

I do have some free time to cook on the weekdays, but would like to try it soon. I'm starting to get sick of that, so if any one can recommend some quick easy things I can cook and save for the upcoming days at work...I just need something I can throw into a lunch bag in the morning and go. 

Thanks for reading guys. ",self,t5_2qoox,1363740933.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nutrition/comments/1am0cg/early_20s_slowlygainingweight_male_looking_for/

To start off, 120 lbs. My fathers side has a history of heart problems. My mom is short and thin, no one on her side of the family is overweight, and I have definitely inherited some of that crazy metabolism. I cannot gain weight even if I try. 

It would be a great understatement to say that I'm a picky eater. When it comes to food
There are a few exceptions to this rule- I have been known to enjoy beans, potatoes, and granola. Thats about all I can think of off the top of my head. As far as things I can put down, but don't enjoy... apples come to mind, thats about it. I have always felt weird about chewing 'plant matter', as silly as that sounds.

There are some fruits and veggies I can get down in their non-default form, the flavor of banana does not jive so well with my taste buds. That being said, it is still bread, and I could still eat it if I really wanted to. Tomato sauce is great, I love pasta and pizza, but would never have a tomato on my burger. Some smoothies are doable. I used to eat a decent amount of strawberry yogurt, but now they include chunks of actual strawberries in it and it kind of ruins the texture for me. I know I need to open myself to eating these things
some frequent meals would be:

morning- english muffin with peanut butter, but not with pulp. Orange juice is great, apple juice and cranberry blends are cool too. 

noon/night- chicken and rice, pizza, tacos/burritos, cold sandwiches, and occasionally some fish. All of these would be served 'plain'. 

I eat more sugar than I think most people would. I have often said my favorite food group is ice cream. I am not blind to my health though

I used to take a multivitamin but I have strayed away since reading some arguments against them.

Anyways, and last night I tried a friends hummus. It was good, reminds me of beans, I could definitely do that! These examples are seriously the furthest I've pushed myself since I was probably 9 or 10 years old. Otherwise it has been, for the most part, meat/potatoes/dairy/bread all day every day.

For Breakfast (8:00 or 9:00am), or biscuits. I also drink about 32oz of water and a small cup of naked brand fruit smoothie that has a boost of B-vitamins for energy. 

I usually eat lunch around noon on my way to work. This is usually half a subway or jimmy johns sub. 

The other half and some clementines are what I eat for lunch around 3:00pm or so.

Dinner is whatever my mom or I cook around 8:00. A typical dinner is a meat (chicken

My main concern is lunch. Does anyone have suggestions to improve my diet so I'm in the best shape during the day?

**EDIT**: Here is my friend's counter-argument:

""Look up both Diterpenes and kahweol

""Coffee's most commonly discussed and proven bad is the damage it does to blood vessels and cholesterol as well. It thins blood vessels while the cholesterol levels can clog them.  It also can discolor them.   It is a factor in a host of pulmonary disorders

""I leave out all the caffeine things

""More importantly, and is known to be a risk factor for getting it.  This is doubly true with heavy coffee consumption (defined as 600 ml or more a day).

""The problem is, mostly in the form of anti oxidants, and ignore the bad.   So while soda is certainly without many good effects (though my cherry 7-up has antioxidants too), its list of bad is far less severe. As is the case with wine, the benefits of such can be gotten wholly from other means (red grapes or grapejuice for the wine, chocolate for the coffee) without adding the slue of risk factors.

I'm interested in starting a cut next week when I return from spring break

A little backstory. I got a knee injury in January and was expecting a quick recovery which hasn't happened. So while I'm still recovering I though I would cut some weight while I can't lift legs. 

I currently do 5/3/1 with core days instead of leg days. I also have ROTC training every day 

I currently weigh 185 lbs.

I really have a couple of questions about cutting. 
1) what is an ideal macro ratio. I've heard a lot of different things from like 5% carbs to a balanced 40p/30f/30c. I was aiming for a 50p/30c/20f. Would this be a good ratio? I think it would be good to have a good amount of carbs for ROTC training

2) what are some good foods for cutting. I'm assuming a lot of veggies but what about protein and fat sources?

3) is there a website or another source for good recipes and foods for cutting?

That's all I have for now.

The thing is in high school I ate unhealthy food a lot...I ate out often and ate fast food at least 3 times a week.

So I start college and stop eating fast food (I literally never eat fast food anymore...havent had a burger since i can remember). I become super stressed out and don't eat much because I lose my appetite. Two years later I only weigh 101 pounds...just two pounds away from being extremely underweight according to the BMI. I don't look anorexic but I'm not happy with my body and being so underweight.

I have been eating more for the past 5 months (by eating healthy) and drinking protein shakes that are meant to help with weight gain (not religiously cause they kind of make me want to throw up they're so gross and sweet) but I actually ended up LOSING 5-ish pounds instead of gaining...though my boobs did get bigger (idk wtf...)

Right now I want to cry because I just got back from the doctor and was expecting I would be at least 105 but instead I'm 101 and I feel hideous.

I don't work out though my boyfriend says I should because it may help me get more of an appetite but running makes me feel sick and makes my lungs hurt and I hate it...and running actually makes me lose my appetite as well

Anyways now I'm considering seeing a professional

EDIT: If anyone has any tips on how I can gain weight (such as what to eat...how often to eat...an exercises that would help) please share! :)

EDIT EDIT: Here's what I ate yesterday 


morning- one egg over easy with whole grain bread and half a glass of orange juice

lunch- one piece of liver

snacks- a bar of chocolate, a serving of strawberries, half a protein bar, and another pita pocket filled with chicken salad

dinner- one bok choy

snack- two buttermilk waffles with butter and half a glass of milk

Anyways this is actually a little less than what I usually eat as I would usually have had a pasta dish somewhere in there but lacked an appetite because I was sad about the weight loss

That saga ended with me blacking out

Unfortunately anxiety is a vicious beast and when left alone will grow large again and attempt to consume your life, I can occasionally force myself to try steak or something if someone else has cooked it, but this is about as bad as it's been since the rice chex situation.

I never really fully recovered from that and am sitting at 5'7"" weight between 115-120lbs depending on the day. I need to start adding foods to my diet (or back to my diet) and I come from a foodie family

I worked out a concept for what I want to have tomorrow (Going to do a baked mac and cheese w/ Broccoli, maybe hardboiled eggs or baked eggs as well) but I'm lacking ... well another 2 meals. My caloric intake lately has only been about 1000 a day (should be at least 1,500.) and my vitamin intake has been fairly atrocious (although the spinach has kept me alive I suppose)

I really need some help/direction with this and wanted to come to you guys, avacados (I know, I wish I could eat them but I have a panic attack every time I try, despite how healthy they are), chicken (which is extra weird because turkey is fine, and chicken eggs are fine), and rice (don't ask me why, if it were simple I wouldn't be here right now).

**TL:DR** I have anxiety that prevents me from eating normally

* Liquids are almost entirely H2O (recently as much as 64 oz/day). Almond milk with breakfast or a glass of soy milk here and there. 1-2 small cups of coffee a day.

* Meat is mostly turkey and chicken. I'm not a huge fan of seafood and I can't cook it well enough to eat it regularly.

* All wheat/oat/grain is whole - bread, etc I make sure to read the labels for all whole wheat (none of that some whole wheat, mostly bleached wheat crap)

* Dairy is cheese and that's about it. I admittedly probably eat more cheese than I should

* I read labels but I'm not fully sure what I'm looking for; tips in this area would be much appreciated. I avoid HFCS and fake sugars and basically anything that has what I think is too many ingredients

* I would love some tips on eating more veggies! I'm not a big fan of them but I know I don't eat nearly as many as I should as often as I should

* Fruits I also need to increase but not as much as veggies. I juice occasionally but not as much as I used to

* Fast food is limited to Jimmy John's and the like and I only average about 3x a month.

I'm in the UK so at the moment that means I start fasting at 3:30ish a.m. and I can start eating again at 9:25 p.m.

It's nearly 18 hours without food and I want to be sure I'm eating as well as I can in the times that I can eat. As I'm a fairly fit person and train in MMA throughout the rest of the year, so I'd like to cross check with you guys to make sure I'm sort of aiming for the right stuff.


This morning I woke up at 2:50 a.m. so I could have breakfast

- one and a have pints of water (ideally I'd go for 1 litre minimum but I just can't down that much in the morning with food)

- some spaghetti with mince meat (left over dinner from the night

- a nice dose of porridge with a some honey to sweeten it and a truck load of peanut butter (it's beautiful with porridge)

 - a smaller dose of all bran with raisins (and some peanut butter)


In the night ( 9:30 p.m.)  I am planning to break the fast with a pint of water and some dates. Then after a little rest I will have some more porridge with peanut butter around 45 minutes before I go to the gym. I will have a strong black coffee around 20 minutes before the gym and I will take a nice large protein shake with me to sip mainly after the workout (like I normally do after workouts)

( I will be drinking around 1 - 2 litres of water during the workout itself )

I will then come home at around 11:30 I'd imagine

Tomorrow morning I am again going to try and have the same but include a protein shake in there as well.


Would you experts please let me know if I'm eating the best I can in the time frame given? I'm aiming for the low G.I. foods and also foods low on the ""Insulin Index"" as well which is similar to G.I.

&gt;It has been estimated that people in the Paleolithic era consumed 11

Basically I keep seeing over and over that the recommendation is to have more potassium than sodium intake in your diet. I also came across salt substitutes like [this from morton's](http://www.mortonsalt.com/for-your-home/culinary-salts/food-salts/5/morton-salt-substitute/) that contain no sodium and 610mg of potassium per serving. I had never heard of salt substitutes before tonight but one article I came across while googling suggested mixing 3 parts potassium(the salt substitute) to one part table salt and using that instead of regular salt for seasoning. I guess the salt substitute on it's own can taste metallic to some people but most can't tell the difference if you mix in some regular table salt. 

Any thoughts on whether mixing salt substitute with table salt to use as a seasoning would be a good idea to help with the overall sodium to potassium ratio in our diets?

Any thoughts on the potassium to salt ratio as it relates to optimal health? 

To me it seems similar to the omega 3 omega 6 ratio in the modern diet and if people are using fish oil or flax oil to help improve that ratio wouldn't it also make sense to do something like this with potassium?

I've read many summaries of scientific articles like the china study and similar things that shed light on many of the popular misconceptions like the lipid hypothesis.

I have heard a few acquaintances and just recently my roommate removing sugar from their diets which from what I can deduce seems both superfluous and ineffective.

Superfluous because removing sugar is going to limit the options for what they can eat massively especially when not at home with snacks and eating out which I've experienced when I was a vegetarian and the annoying hunger and lack of options was one of the things that made me hate being veg.

That wouldn't be so bad of course
Sure there is some fructose and that can risk diabetes but MOST cereals

So when you are out an about and you get your nice black coffee with a ""nice heathly"" ham and cheese on rye with a GI of 55-70 is it really that much more helpful.

I suppose just writing this I can guess that there are many types of people this could help

I am in a much healthier place now. My eating and exercise in check

I am an athlete--I run pretty much daily, I have also read up on other diets (Paleo, Keto, etc.),  and it seems to me that a low carb diet is very successful for some people. However, it is also very difficult to maintain a low carb vegan diet. In an omnivorous diet, grains can be replaced with meat protein. In a vegan diet, beans, but most of these do contain carbohydrates. Now, but I am also afraid that I have fallen prey of vegan propaganda. 

I have tried to lower my consumption of carbohydrates

I disagree with the treatment of animals and the way they are killed. My reason for keeping to a vegan diet is that there is no reason in modern times, we aren't hunters.

But my concern at this moment is my own health. Yes, and I want to make sure I can live the best life I can. 

What I am thinking of adding back to my diet is seafood, not WILL BE. Please don't attack me for my thoughts here--I thought it would be good to voice how I am feeling and see how others feel about it. I still have a bad taste in my mouth whenever I think about eating animals again. But I am worried about my long-term health. I want to make sure I am fueling my body with adequate protein and other nutrients. I know that there is no perfect diet, and I know that veganism is not just a diet, but a lifestyle, and I do not want to make a lifestyle change without being fully informed.

He usually goes out for lunch and will get food from a fast-food restaurant (usually Wendys, but is still terrible), pizza, or a sandwich from a deli (or made at home), meat+mayo only, no veggies. Occasionally he will get food from a buffet, and will get steamed veggies

For dinner, I usually make some sort of pan-fried chicken/pork (our oven is broken or I'd bake it) mashed potatoes, and cauliflower. Last night he had 4 hot dogs for dinner, nothing else. 

His opinion on the vegetables and other 'lite foods' is that they dont' fill him up, and will only then have a few bites, until he's 'too full' to eat any more. I really think he only eats to feel full.

He is also very picky, except vodka sauce, and only sometimes. The only veggies I've seen him eat are string beans, carrots, cauliflower and broccoli. Nothing with lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms (except chicken marsala, which I dont' understand)

I also dont' think he drinks enough water

He gets very tired early at night, but he doesn't listen. I've tried a billion ways to make him understand that how he's eating is a problem, but it's hard to make him see it that way.

Here's the recipe I use

My concern is that it's a little high in carbs. The banana adds a lot

I'm trying to lose about 40 lbs and I'm aiming for around 2000 calories a day. I'm 32M, 13 lbs in barely a month actually, but I think the rate's high as I just made big diet changes, started an eca stack, and upped my exercise consistency all at the same time a few weeks ago.

Also, so I'm ok with getting more cals from fat as long as I hit my calorie goals. My fat sources are usually fish, olive oil, deli meat at lunch, milk, nuts but very much in moderation because it's so easy to blow my calorie goal by eating too many nuts - so I think good sources of fat overall.

**EDIT** Here's a revised recipe I think I might try: http://i.imgur.com/xDl7AHn.png

It subs coconut water for milk or juice to thin the mix with lower calories and more potassium. Drop the banana. Switch greek yogurt instead of plain for lower carbs and higher protein. Stevia instead of agave. And protein powder as an addition. Cocoa powder too for the micronutrients

We use Genesis R &amp; D software, Erythritol = 1 carb = 0.20 calories, Sorbitol 1 carb = 2.6 calories, and (Sugar = 1 carb = 4 calories) that is why your carb count to calorie count does not match.

Nausea, constipation, I'd had a few tests done (endoscopy and ultrasound) and been put on and taken off of a ton of different pills.  Nothing really seemed to help

I happened upon a friend of my wife's that is a nutritionist and she actually had me fill out a food/symptom journal for 2 weeks and immediately pointed out that I had some dairy issues, I had issues.  I used a non-dairy creamer, but apparently those are derived from milk and still have some of the proteins in them.  She also determined I had a meat issue as on days where I had more than one serving of meat, I had issues.  So, her analysis has led me to cut out most meat and all dairy, except stuff like yogurt which doesn't seem to bother me.  She said what my problem appears to be is a B vitamin deficiency and some kind of issues digesting certain proteins in the meats and milk products.

I've started taking a one a day multivitamin and a B-Complex vitamin and watching to make sure I don't eat those things on the list.  She said that eventually I may be able to eat more like I used to, which she also said would help me because of the probiotics.  Does everything she has told me seem right?  I know I've probably not provided everything in the world that would be needed to make a guess, so if I missed something I should have said I do or don't do, just ask :)

4 days a week I'm out the door at 6am, on average every 1-2 hours. Part of it is that I am quite busy, and part is that I have an irritable bowel so I don't make the most of what goes in my stomach. It would make these long work days much easier (not to mention improve my productivity) if I didn't have to keep stepping aside to snack or have to keep a pocketful of snacks at all times. By ""hungry"" I don't mean ""I could eat"", but more ""oh man, my mind is getting fuzzy, I need some energy"".

My typical breakfast is an apple w/ peanut butter, and a cup of coffee. Sometimes I do oatmeal, but I noticed I get hungry faster with oatmeal. For snacks, I carry around peanut butter clif bars. Breakfast usually keeps me for 2 hours, and then I usually need a clif bar every 1-1.5 hours until lunch. For lunch on busy days I will have something really fatty from fast food, like a burger/fries, because it is quick, and keeps me full for up to 3 hours. Then I usually have 1 or 2 more bars before the end of my work day. After work I make myself a salad with baked chicken or fish

As a single guy, healthy foods can be either be inconvenient, expensive, or both.  OR, once you've finally found some recipes that work, you get tired of them quickly, especially since it takes extra work (in my opinion) to make healthy food taste appealing.


SO, I will blend a huge batch of this, drink one shake for breakfast, one for lunch, and one for dinner, keeping them refrigerated in blender bottles during the day:


*8 oz Greek yogurt (plain

*1/2 cup Egg whites

*2 scoops Vanilla Whey protein

*1 Tbsp Natural Peanut Butter

*1/2 cup Almond milk

*1/2 cup Steel cut oats (cooked and cooled)

*2 cups Spinach

*1 Tbspn Raw Honey

*100% cocoa dark chocolate

*1/2 cup each- Frozen blueberries

*1 Lime

*1/2 frozen banana

*1/4 cup pomegranate juice

I would consume these 13 ingredients every day, and dinner.  The only other variety I would get would be eating out with friends 2-3 times per week for dinner, where I would order chicken breast with vegetables (or something similar).

Here are the positives:  When I plug all ingredients into MyFitnessPal, etc plus adequate iron, protein, and the macro nutrient ratio is a nice 40-30-30. It's relatively low sugar, low sodium, etc.

Breakfast:

* piece of dry toast (Nature's Pride nutty oat bread or homemade bread) or a small homemade bagel covered in flax seeds and sunflower seeds with a tbsp cream cheese

* a piece of fruit

Lunch:

* Usually some kind of salad. Today I ate 1/2 c lettuce with cooked corn/black beans/onion/bell peppers (no dressing). My other go to salad has beets, green olives and a bit of feta. Sometimes I use a bit of Newman's Own greek dressing (maybe 2 tsp)

* either fruit or another vegetable (today I ate 1/2 a grapefruit, no oil or butter)

Dinner

* Last night I had a piece of tilapia (marinated in soy sauce, hot sauce + some spices), sauteed onions, pineapple, black beans, corn, bell peppers, black pepper

* tonight I'm going to make a quiche with kale, and olives (the crust is homemade using 1 c flour, 1/4 c cold water, 1/4 c olive oil)

Snacks/Drinks

* 2-6 cups of coffee

* a cookie (or some small sweet for an after-dinner snack)

* beer or a gin and diet tonic with dinner

I think I probably need some more protein in my diet, but I only eat it once a week or less.
