&gt;Also known as : AIE (Attention induced euphoria)
This is sometimes referred to as head orgasms

Again

**EDIT:** Thanks for all the feedback, especially considering this is currently the top post in the subreddit and apparently no one did anything about this last time. This seems to be something the subreddit cares about as a whole, so even if this gets ignored, I'm willing to bet it'll resurface again. 

Now

I frequently visit this subreddit and one thing that has somewhat bothered me since becoming familiar with ASMR is a particular description of the sensation in the sidebar:

&gt; Also known as : AIHO (Attention induced head orgasm)

The sidebar is typically where I would assume most people go when they are exploring a new subreddit that isn't particularly run-of-the-mill

While anyone who has explored ASMR a bit would know that the sensation isn't (for most) a sexual sensation, I think it would be a step (albeit small) toward clearing things up.

Additionally, but when searching for ""AIHO"" and ""AIE"" in Google, I only got one relevant result (it was Urban Dictionary). 

Ultimately

TL;DR: No one calls it AIHO or AIE. Saying they're ""orgasms"" helps perpetuate the misconception that ASMR is sexual. ",self,t5_2sbyc,1367425699.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/1dagb3/suggestion_remove_aihohead_orgasms_from_the/

1356024139.0,156bvt,Hi /r/ASMR.  I am a sound designer and I did some research on ASMR speech.  I found some pretty astounding stuff. ,fatjesus,641,83,96,"[I did a podcast on the results if you want to listen](https://soundcloud.com/ashellinthepit/alone-in-the-cave-ep-47-what).

I just found out about ASMR a few days ago, not a scientist, but I have audio tools and an OK grasp on the scientific method so I thought I'd take a crack at it.  

Here is what I did:

I took 5 samples of ASMR speech [Bob Ross](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9sJ4NAugxg), [AppreciateASMR](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pclezy71o9M), and [GentleWhispering](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RVpfHgC3ye0)

I selected a random 2 minute chunk from the audio of each video and then analyzed the length of each phrase and each pause.  For contrast I then did the same with [Bill O'Reilly and Geraldo having hissy fits](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3U9ENaTPLY) and for control I measured the cadence of [Dan Ariely giving a speech on social economics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X68dm92HVI). 

The results were very surprising.  [You can check out the data here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AjfRW9SNkEWKdGliSjFTV04zQW9WWFppTEI4NW1CM0E#gid=0).  Please note I am not a spreadsheet master by any means.

Notable results: 

**ASMR Speakers have uncannily similar pause:speech ratios.**  After I summed up the pauses, and Dan Ariely only pauses 16% of the time.  Also, **the average length of pause for *all 5* ASMR samples fell between 1.16 and 1.6 seconds**. Billy O and Geraldo: 0.19 seconds.  Dan Ariely: 0.42.  

**ASMR speakers use short phrases**, a difference of only half a second.  **The average phrase length of three of the samples were virtually identical**.  I realize a half second can be a big deal in some situations, but compared to Bill O'Reilly (4.7 seconds) the tight grouping is interesting.  

These were the things that popped out most to me.  I would love to do a frequency and amplitude based analysis as well

Hope this helps any of those trying to become ASMR practitioners of some kind--I plan on using the data to add ASMR qualities to sounds I design.  I'd love to hear what other

1335352296.0,srlfv,On why this subreddit is failing,ximina,510,149,146,"*EDIT 2) I just found out a cause of some of the confusion: Many mobile users have never read the side bar! Always read the side bar! Many of the problems with this subreddit could be solved if everyone simply read it.
EDIT 1) I am referring to the people who blatantly state in the comments (eg OP says: ""I don't really get the tingles, but I'm sure others saw them.)

I suggest reading the whole post before commenting, so this isn't a complaint rant and 2- Chances are, your argument was refuted in an area that you skimmed.* 

First off, many videos serve both purposes, but that's not the issue. It's the people who actively upvote and post videos to relax that they don't get ASMR from. In addition, less common ASMR triggers are being called frisson triggers more and more. This is getting super annoying for me as a person who frequents both [/r/asmr](/r/asmr)  and [/r/Frisson](/r/Frisson). Frisson, by definition, is at it's base an emotion (not necessarily sensation), and very different from ASMR. Don't just send all the unwanted content to frisson


So
Allow downvotes again. 
When they were disabled, and I'm not talking about my own triggers. After speaking to my friends, they have agreed that the content has been very hit and miss. There is no perfect system, but I think Reddit's system should be used because A) this is Reddit, not Onlyupvotesland B)The reddit algorithm is intended for large reddits, and should do a better job of pushing new/good posts to the front page than disallowing down voting. It uses the downvotes,

As ofd25 says below (and you should upvote them)
Videos that most would considering soothing and relaxing,000? We need the ability to filter stuff like that out because as it is, only allowing a video to be upvoted enables it to shoot straight to the top. 

Not down voting has not lead to better content making it to the front pages


Let's be honest here: If we could downvote tagless things



TL;DR, the subreddit worked better before, and disallowing downvotes hasn't made any less common triggers surface regularly. With regular complaint threads that are regularly upvoted more than the actual content in this subreddit, and many of it's subscribers unhappyit's time to change something. 

Side note: Don't tell people something isn't a trigger just because you've never heard of it being one, gifs, videos, music and real life. Literally anything everything is fair game! 

Also side note for my own agenda: Why can't we post musical asmr again? I really don't think that it's easy to confuse the two, and frisson has a powerful surge of intense emotion that often gives you goosebumps. To me, they're very different and I feel like I'm missing out on a lot of good content because music is banned. I'm curious how many more music triggerers there are and if we should un-ban it or start a music asmr. subreddit.",,False,self,t5_2sbyc,,http://www.reddit.com/r/asmr/comments/srlfv/on_why_this_subreddit_is_failing/

I remember one of my most powerful asmr experiences was  in high school when a substitute teacher quietly came up behind my desk. I heard her breathing softly as she watched over me while I was busy writing the essay she had assigned us. Then she unexpectedly patted me on my back for good behavior before leaving. 

The experience lasted 5 minutes but the asmr it produced gave me a high for the rest of the day and I could recreate it again and again just by thinking about it. Even now

These videos are pleasant but they don't  seem to produce that intense almost full body orgasm like effect and I think it's because I'm anticipating it.

I was at work sitting at my desk lost in a daydream about something that made me happy (cant remember what exactly). I had slept well the night before

An elderly lady came into the office

She walked over to my desk and sat down. Again, pen, and several small bags of cash (small bills). I heard every rustle of the bags and the soft scratching of her fingertips as she brushed the cloth lining of her purse in search of her coin bag. The coins jingled as she pulled the bag free of her makeup case. (contented sigh)

She clicked her pen. I melted. She began writing out a check using smooth strokes

When she finally finished filling out the check, and reached out to hand it to me. I responded by reaching for it at half speed and with the utmost care. As I took it from her, she softly asked if I would please cash the check for her, as she had some bills that needed paying. I was a ball of goo at this point, but I managed to respond with a low, curteous ""sure"" and asked how much she needed.

She smiled a wry smile, ""I need about tree fiddy."" That's when I noticed she was an eight story tall crustacean from the paleolithic era.

I don't know when that rule was created, and if we uphold that rule for this subreddit, why is there a problem?  I think creating a separate (potentially redundant) subreddit leads to less people being exposed to content overall, and even though there are many subscribers to this subreddit, I don't think the amount of content being submitted justifies a sub-subreddit.  There are only 90 people subscribed to r/nsfwasmr anyway, and there are barely any links.

It it done using two omnidirectional microphone elements placed in the [ears of a human](http://i.imgur.com/CQmpL.jpg), and is experienced properly by listening with headphones.

As far as other stereo methods, [Mid/Side](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound#M.2FS_technique:_Mid.2FSide_stereophony), [Near-coincident](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stereophonic_sound#Near-coincident_technique:_mixed_stereophony), and other variations.  Cardioid, Omnidirectional, and figure-8 polar pattern microphone elements are typically used.

If you're using a portable compact field recorder with built in microphones to record the audio for your ASMR videos, ORTF, or M/S stereo recording methods.

I highly encourage that if your audio recording is not actually ""binaural, then by all means, please label it as such... Also a good idea to note ""use headphones for best experience,"" or something like that...

First
http://audacity.sourceforge.net/download/

Audacity is a free and open source audio editing program.


When you record your video


Now open up audacity and drag your video into the program. It will load the audio file from the video.
http://i.imgur.com/tezF0xz.jpg


Now go to the start of the video and zoom in so we can see the first 10 seconds easily. You zoom in by holding ctrl + up scroll.


Now mark the 10 second area (click and drag to mark). Make sure you only get the unwanted sound.
http://i.imgur.com/Vnuj5of.jpg


Now go to ""Effect"" from the top menu and choose ""noise removal""
http://i.imgur.com/Rw1HAfh.jpg


In the noise removal plugin

Then unmark the 10 second area by just clicking anywhere on the audio track.


Now go back to ""effect"" and ""noise removal"" again.
Make sure the settings look like this on ""step 2""
http://i.imgur.com/09en3mq.jpg

(You can play around with the settings to see what works best for you

Press ok. 

VOILA! That anoying static sound in your video is gone! 
press the play button to make sure everything sounds ok.

Now to save the file

Now


I personally get huge ASMR tingles from tapping fingernails, eating or swallowing food it is a completely different thing. I start to panic, sweat, I feel rage boiling up inside me and I feel that sick like adrenaline feeling, and unless I either leave the room or vocalize my rage, it just does not go away, it is completely involuntary. What is funny is how specific the triggers are, the wet lip smacking with the jaw moving loads then the gulp (I'm starting to get agitated just thinking about it).

I just wondered if perhaps ASMR and this where in an way related? They sound like complete polar opposites.

This is why mammals (and I guess they are finding birds as well) enjoy being stroked, leading researchers to believe the sensation was both calming and pleasurable.

Interestingly enough MRGPRB4+ [is not found in genetalia](http://takashi.mb.jhu.edu/Xinzhong%20Dong%20Papers/MrgprB4%20paper.pdf) (for all those jokers who mistake behaviors with sexual- it is related to the presence of hair and it is *speculated* this neron encourages grooming and bonding.

I propose a hypothesis that the chemicals that activate these neurons are released with the use of soft touch help produce a small amount of the ASMR experience.

(LINK REMOVED)


Update* It appears as if I am going to have to pull the survey soon. surveymonkey.com/ has only one monthly option and its $24 bucks (1000 results). I have no problem paying that but its 15 cents per result after that. I had no idea this survey was going to be so successful. We are at 920 responses and I am going to cap it at a 1000. I have only seen the data for the first hundred but after I upgrade give me a couple of hours and I will extrapolate it into a more usable form ( as some of you noted I only listed 3 triggers and a fill in the blank option so I will need to look it over). So keep taking it I am going to monitor it close and pull the link when I near 1k!!! 

Thanks ASRM Community.

Update 2

So we are at 992. I am pulling plug incase anyone is currently doing the survey.  This got pushed back later in the day so I may not get up the data untill tomorrow morning. I will post results ASAP.

However, she became one of my favorites, and I was frustrated, if not flat-out upset, that we lost her.

This has been a sad trend. Cutebunny992, thankfully) -- they and many more have been casualties of hate and/or misrepresentation.

So I'd like to take a stand and write an article about it. To do that

[TheWaterwhispers has a pertinent video about this] (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BZZMn5lS2qw&amp;feature=youtu.be) and sgcollins makes good points [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TZdaqmz44M) and [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NLJDveCFuck).

If I get the article published, I still think this is a good forum as any to trade ideas and make our community even stronger. I know a couple threads along these lines have been posted in the past few months, but that just shows how urgent an issue this is. If hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people experience ASMR and don't know there's a name for it, I think the ASMR community could be an extremely powerful positive force if we could just understand how to let people know about it more effectively.

Oh, but it's all I got, since I haven't made any ASMR videos of my own. 

Thank you!  

**Edit**: 65 comments so far! I really appreciate it. Of course

Reading all the things you have to say has already given me a better perspective of this problem. So I'd like to synthesize what I've learned and what I'd like to refine:

**1)** Several of you have pointed out it's not so much a question of hate as it is of misrepresentation,"" but that was a buzzword a couple ASMRtists used to describe their problems, so I thought why the hell not, I'll use that word. You've shown me it's more complicated then people hatin': youtubers have myriad reasons for doing what they do, and examining the depth and breadth of those reasons would be interesting.

**2)** A couple of you have suggested I talk to ASMRtists directly and ask their opinions on this issue. This is a good idea, I'm not so much interested in why youtube is a wretched hive of scum and villainy (a dissertation in and of itself) as much as why ASMRtists/ers are constantly getting sniped.

**3)** Some of you have expressed interest in moving ASMRtists off of youtube. Do you think such a thing can be done? If so

**4)** A very common answer is ""They condemn what they do not understand."" I get that some people don't get ASMR

Apparently no one knows why she deleted her account

I think now may be the time to develop some kind online guide to help new ASMR practitioners be better prepared to be successful and not be emtionaly terrorized by trolls.

I think that practitioners should be actively encouraged to consider always turning off comments on youtube if their entire purpose is to generate suggestions. Perhaps there can be a site where people can offer up general scenarios and suggestions that are both curated to weed out trolls and not tied to any specific practitioner. This way someone considering making a new video can simply visit and check out all the new ideas and be inspired without having to worry weeding through abusive comments.

I could also see it offering specific triggers, eye contact, or whatever.

Some practitioners clearly have no problem with the trolls--like me

I think another option is to consider turning off the comments on videos, but none of them would be publicly visible... and I think that is a huge part of the problem...

Anway I am rambling here; I just want to figure out how to do SOMETHING to provide the support for ASMR practitioners so they don't run screaming away from the internet...

Any one else have others ideas?

I am wondering if any of you guys are like me in that they experienced this with much more frequency when they were younger? 

When I was around like the age of 10 people who's voices would not normally induce asmr could very rarely cause it through certain phrases and I would be able to recall these phrases in my mind and experience asmr again with pretty much the same intensity as the original occurance. There was a sort of diminishing return when recalling phrases like this though and after a while they would sort of lose their potency. 

At age 20 though I experience asmr with less frequency and intensity and random phrases from people who wouldn't normally induce it don't seem to ever do it for me any more. I think perhaps an apt analogy would  be that it is like I have gained a tolerance to a drug after using it for a long time
