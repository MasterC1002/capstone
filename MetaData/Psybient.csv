It's a pretty ridiculous idea that travels between different eras/civilizations in a much different way than ""Cloud Atlas"" and much more like a graphic novel reboot of Koyaanisqatsi or Power of Tens or Zeitgeist in a sci-fi realm.

Music will be a primary focus of the film. When I say ""sampling"" something I really think that would be cool for the context of the story, but whether that or original score, I'd be honored and think it would work.  Credit will go to anyone involved in a major way since music is the key and there's very few ""stars"" and even the biggest central character isn't on the screen for more than 20-25 minutes.  Ideally we will distribute the soundtrack, and you get one with the price of the DVD/digital.  ",,False,self,False,t3_12y133
