The program makes a file in %APPDATA% called `bahranisoft.exe` (the creator's website's name) or `extrctr.exe` and forces it to run on Windows startup (the program creates some registry keys to do so).

Keylogger logs can be found in `%APPDATA%\dclogs` and are named `&lt;date&gt;-#.dc` (""dc"" meaning ""DarkComet"" I presume). These are plain text files you may view in a text editor such as Notepad. Inside each .dc file you will find logs of every application you have opened (including the time) and typed or pressed keys in (Skype, clipboard changes, and more. If you've typed any passwords, credit card information, etc., you'll probably find them here with a bit of CTRL+F'ing.

*SSL-independent security; all sensitive messages to and from the server have an extra level of strong encryption (4096-bit RSA to the server
*Secure data storage; all messages on the server are secured with 2048-bit OpenPGP
*SSL-less MITM foiling; after you create an account

What I would like to be able point the magic app to a directory with a ton of MP3's in it...lets assume all filenames are fucked up, like SoundHoud or Shazam android apps do),  identify it, rename it in a specific format, fill out the MP3 information for the file, and place it into a ""completed"" directory of some sort.

I installed their streaming audio recorder program and used the trial. It actually worked fairly well and I was considering purchasing it. Then I uninstalled it because the trial was over. I then needed it again later that day so I tried installing it again and of course it wouldn't let me. They  use sophisticated registry tweaks to prevent you from re-using the trial after it's over. What I realized is that they spew their garbage all over the registry. If you use a program like process monitor

So then I uninstalled again and I thought that was that. A few days later, because when I previously uninstalled Wondershare, it had immediately launched my browser and took me to a ""special deal"" page that claimed I would get a % discount if I ordered right now. Obviously it's an underhanded tactic to grab peoples' money before they forget about the product. I wonder if anyone has actually fallen for that crap...

I verified that I uninstalled all Wondershare products, and their response was to basically go and delete the Helper program. The helper program was installed into C:\Program Files\Common Files\Wondershare, which is different than the main application folder that was previously under Program Files. When I tried to delete the application it gave me an access denied error, because the process was still running in memory. I had to force quit the process before I could delete the helper, and this was after Wondershare had already supposedly been removed from my system (and did not appear anywhere in Add/Remove Program).

No panic

So i go to events and see the event ""  You deleted 39629 files "" but there is no Undelete. No way to undo an event. You can just see it. Utterly pointless.

After a few days of manually undeleting the files I sent a message to Dropbox following their procedure for asking for an undelete. Days later I get a reply that they are too busy to help.

Surely a bulk undelete feature would not be hard to implement and one that would be high on the trust needs of users.

So just a warning to others....

The plugins are still awesome, and I know these problems are fixed in 4.0, but it feels like they are having a reaally hard time keeping up with their [schedule](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4/Beta) (which has already been updated because they were seriously far behind).

I'm particularly concerned about [this](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Platform/2010-12-07#Firefox):

    *  [AT RISK] Finish Firefox 4
          o 224 Firefox/Toolkit blockers 

And the fact that they couldn't keep up with their ""zero reproducible high/crit &gt; 30 days"" bug policy.

I know there are betas

1st time posting here

In short, rather than being forced into then thinking about how you will achieve them.

For example, which opens Outlook (if it's closed) and opens a new email immediately for me. 

Another example to illustrate the goal-oriented nature of it would be if I want to do a google search. Ordinarily, Chrome, click the address bar, type, enter. With Executor, I simply ALT+Z and type ""g wimbledon"" and hit enter. It fires up the program, takes anything after ""g"" as a search string and executes it. Over the course of a day this actually makes everything a lot quicker.

It's highly configurable. ""g"" in the example above is because I configured that. I could make it ""q"" (for query). Or - just as easily - ""w [query]"" to fire up a Wikipedia query. Or ""lastfm [band name]"".

It will auto-search for programs on your machine and also index all files on local and network drives (if you want - I have all this switched off to reduce CPU overhead

I have some useful config strings set up if you want to get started and would be happy to share. 

Typing ""excel"" is much easier than looking for the icon or traversing menus. It also does inline maths

A hard one to find, which is:
Command:
C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\Office14\OUTLOOK.EXE
Params:
/c ipm.note

Hope this is useful to someone.",,t5_2qh19,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/software/comments/1i00cd/executor_handsdown_the_best_freeware_pc_program/

but apart from that


I'd love to love Chrome. It's light-weight and fast

It always amazes me when an otherwise great app limits the users in ways which do not provide any extra value (in terms of performance for instance). The main problem is that goddamn address bar. Using Firefox (or Opera, I should be able to type ""te"" and get there right away - I don't want to look for ""te"" in a search engine! It's completely counterintuitive. 

I'm an active member of a discussion board dedicated to music. Most of the time I read topics which have existed for some time, it takes me less than a second to find the topic I want to read, from among hundreds of those I have visited. In Chrome I always have to wait until it decides what to display, and even if it luckily decides I wasn't about to use the search engine, the process of finding in history is slow and VERY imprecise. 

Say I want to go to a thread about the band Slayer. In Firefox, what I see after typing ""Sl"" is ""Sl - Google search"", then a couple of google results (in this case it displays links to dictionaries...). In order to get to this thread by means of the address bar (to omit going through the entire structure of the board), I'd have to write the name of the discussion board and then see if I'm lucky enough for Chrome to understand what I meant by ""Sl""... Which happens rarely.

/rant

-----------------------------------

**edit:** (I'll copy one of my responses to make things clear):

It's not about convincing anybody. Chrome is a decent browser anyway - it's just that I focused on it's drawbacks that it seems I hate it ;). It's not the case. However, I can't. Hence, the rant ;)

**edit2:** What I meant when I wrote about the bookmarks: Firefox allows me to do this: http://i.imgur.com/vA2u5.png -&gt; everything in a single row: address bar, search. the address bar is still long enough and I have access to my most used bookmarks at all times. saves a lot of space and I don't have to switch anything.",,False,,t5_2qh19,True,,

Windows redraw about 2-3 times slower (e.g. Winamp takes about .7 seconds to fully redraw when called up) but there is no more spinning the fan on every stupid operation that spikes the CPU for a fraction of a second

In fact I didn't modify my existing power plan

**Update 3 days later** For the sake of completeness, and forget full screen in many cases. The worst thing is, my fan still spins up... And (probably due to this crummy laptop), when that happens, it often never spins down again. I have to manually switch to full power (choose the regular power plan) then run some crazy app that heats up the CPU, close it and switch back to Slowpoke. I don't know why, but this forces the retarded hardware to notice the temperature is dropping

Some programs can do it all automatically (Chrome, qbittorrent, EasyPHP, KeePass etc). Some not-so-well-coded applications are even worse (iTunes, Java).

EpicRewind is video capture software that has a key differentiating feature: RAM RollingBuffer mode. This works like an on-demand instant-replay: a game is hooked and the video is continuously buffered in system RAM, encoding and writing to disk only happen when you choose to save a video clip. During video buffering, the contents of the framebuffer are just being copied to system memory X times per second based your specified capture FPS.

Key advantages of the RAM RollingBuffer:

- You don't need to pre-plan a gaming video
- Ideal for MMOs and Multiplayer games where 99% of the gameplay isn't worth sharing and the interesting stuff can happen at unexpected times.

Added benefits:

- One of the best benefits is that it saves you time by eliminating the need to dig through all your saved gameplay footage to find the good stuff.
- Saves disk space by not writing countless hours of video to disk your just going to throw away later after you dig out the highlights.
- More efficient use of system resources by not processing and encoding video the entire time your gaming.

You can find more information about EpicRewind here on our website along with some demonstration videos:

http://epicrewind.com

We are at the point now where we have a usable beta build and are looking for more folks to try it out. If this sounds interesting to you feel free to send me a PM and Ill get you signed up

I pointed out that our testers had expressed concern in the first release that what we'd asked for wasn't exactly what we got. They supposedly understood this and provided a second release that 'met our needs'.

When it was pointed out again....their 'configuration enhancements' weren't meeting requirements they requested a meeting, their part owner (and supposedly) lead ""guru"" developer became somewhat agitated, looked me straight in the eye and said, ""But the requirements are just a guide aren't they?"".

There's not many times in my career I've been speechless - and before words would appear in my head, (and I thought this was worthy of film accolades) said, ""you'll be hearing from our lawyers. DougieMac, call security and have these people escorted from the building"" and left.

**What went wrong

Not so good

1: Hosting code on our domain (deskera.com) was a bad

Learning: github is a better place to host an open source project. No doubt about that. 

2: Code issues and check-ins: It's very easy to confuse prospective users with quick code check-ins. We've decided to have a slow roll-out and a fixed delivery schedule for patches and updates


3: Most users are in the silent majority - we never get to hear from 99% of our users. 


Good things

1: Users love our app

2: Reddit! The help we got from this community was outstanding.

Please feel free to comment and make improvements.

1. In Windows Explorer window
2. Open VLC.

3. Go to Media --&gt; Streaming.

4. Go to Capture Device tab.

5. Select capture devices.

6. Click on ""Show more options"" checkbox on the bottom.

7. Go to MRL and ""Edit Options"" for your command line information.  My MRL says ""dshow://"" and the ""Edit Options"" window shows "":dshow-vdev=Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX :dshow-adev=Microphone (Logitech Mic (Co  :dshow-caching=200"".  Note that the Microphone name was cut off.  I looked back up at the Audio Device Name on the Capture Device tab and got the full name for it and finished it so that it would read "":dshow-adev=Microphone (Logitech Mic (Communicate STX))""  You may have to do this for your Video or Audio device if the name wasn't fully captured.  Add the MRL and ""Edit Options"" lines after the path on your notepad document.
8. Click on the ""Stream"" button at the bottom of the page and then click on ""Destinations"".  Next to the ""New destination"" window click on the ""Add"" button and then ""Browse"".  I go right to the C: drive for simplicity sake
9. Click on the ""Options"" button at the bottom of the ""Stream Output"" window.  Copy the text from the ""Generated stream output string"" window to your notepad document
10. You'll want to change your vb (video bitrate)

This is my final command:

""C:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\vlc.exe"" dshow:// :dshow-vdev=""Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX"" :dshow-adev=""Logitech Mic (Communicate STX)""  :dshow-caching=200 :sout=#transcode{vcodec=h264,height=288,acodec=mp3,ab=128,channels=2,samplerate=44000}:duplicate{dst=file{dst=C:/test.ps},dst=display} :no-sout-rtp-sap :no-sout-standard-sap :ttl=1 :sout-keep

Basically i'd like a program that would let me create a game where the user has to look through pictures or videos or listen to sound files and upon finding the correct one, doesn't really matter.)

Any ideas?

Edit:

* I want to have the ability to scan bar codes from my phone using an app that will automatically look it up and feed me back info.

* The app will then give me a list of things I scanned that I can review (adding expiration dates and stuff) and send to a program in my PC that will create an inventory.

* I should be able to access this inventory from my phone (in case I go shopping)

* The application on the computer/phone should allow me to enter some manual ""Everyday Items"" that I should normally have (e.g. bread, it should be able to notify me when I ran out of an everyday item (well, if I keep track of usage)

* A weekly ""Shopping List"" would be great!

* The application on the computer should be able to notify me a few days in advance if I have something that will expire soon.

* **Recipes!!** I should also be able to create recipes using the inventory or find some online that can run against my inventory and offer an ""Ingredients Needed List"" and/or an ""Alternatives List"" 

* If I choose to make a recipe

* I should also be able to enter my own recipes with my own estimated shelf life that can integrate with the system.

* Also the ability to plan out what meals to make, year. Think about it, your kitchen sending you a reminder that you need to buy sweet potatoes for thanksgiving or some tofu for that one cousin that feels the need to be righteous by not eating meat.

* The interface should be easy enough that a Mac user can use it.

* We could work on it

* Finally, location of items, and allow for better management of food.

Well

Edit: Target audience is anyone that likes to use their kitchen

EDIT2: 2 new ideas. Include tips for handling food/how to cook and also integration with local stores.
