I am in need of a flash mob. I am a chairperson for Stillbrave which is a childhood cancer foundation for the DC/MD/VA area. We have a little girl who was just recently diagnosed with brain cancer that we are helping. We provide non-medical assistance to families that are dealing with this crappy thing called cancer. Well...this little girl hasn't been doing so well. She's lost her appetite (which is fairly normal with chemotherapy) and is having a hard time right now. Tara's dream has always been to be a princess. So we are making that dream come true. We have reserved a horse drawn carriage for Friday May 3rd. Tara's mom is having a princess tea party for her and her friends. Our director, put a glass slipper on her little foot and then take her and her friends for a carriage ride.

Now here is where you can come in and help. We want to make her feel like the most special princess there is. So we want to get a large flash mob of people lining the main street the carriage is going to take holding up ""Princess Tara"" signs and cheering her on.

I mean...who wouldn't want to be a part of making this little girl smile? We want this to be big! We want people cheering and yelling and just going nuts for this little girl. She needs a pick me up so she can fight this horrible disease and go on to have many more of her dreams come true. So who's with me? All it will take is a little bit of your time and enthusiasm.

We'd like to keep this hush hush so it's a real surprise for Tara.

Here are the details:  

When:  Friday

Time:  Lining up around 6pm…we’ll be picking Tara up around 6:30pm
Where:  Start lining up at Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow Rd. (they won’t be able to see us from their house)

Who:  ANYONE!  Everyone!  Bring your kids

If anyone would like more details or to help please feel free to contact me at: donations@stillbrave.org

Also check out our site to get more details about what we are doing: www.stillbrave.org

Thank you all....I've read so many stories about Reddit users coming out to help people like this and I hope I'm proved right about how awesome you guys are :)

Kel


Edit:  I corrected the street name to Brandy.  


***UPDATE 5-1-13***
Okay I've talked with Tom (Stillbrave's director) and have a little more info.  Tara's mom will be bringing her home at 5:30pm.  So to avoid the possibility of them seeing a large crowd out there we are asking that everyone meet up at the Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow intersection closest to Rt. 50.  We want to keep people off of Stringfellow any closer to their until we hear that they've made it home.  At that point us Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will get you all in position.  So we can go from from that intersection back towards Rt. 50 and we should be fine.  We can also have people line up on Brandy Station on the far side.  Don't worry...we will be in Stillbrave TShirts so you all will recognize us.  If you're not sure where to go just find one of us and we'll direct you to the right area.

We do not know what route the carriage will take yet...it'll depend on the crowd.  

***********************************


**UPDATE 4-26-13:  Parking...I've spoken with a resident who lives in that area and there is ample street parking for normal use.  This event might go beyond the normal use spectrum.  So here are the options:  There is a pool on Stringfellow for the community that has a parking lot.  I'd use that if you have really small kids

Both corners of Brandy Station &amp; Stringfellow will be the staging areas.  Stillbrave members &amp; volunteers will be on hand to get you in position.

Lastly (for today at least) are there any videographers out there willing to donate their time to come out and record this for Tara?  We'd like to be able to give her a DVD of it that she can watch anytime she's feeling down &amp; needs a pick me up.  Please contact me at:  donations@stillbrave.org if you are interested in donating your time for this.

-At about 5PM on July 31

-Later

-The next morning (August 1st), 1 broken cantelope, 1 pineapple, 8 bananas and 3 apples.  The larger fruits must have been carried onto the lawn rather than thrown.  They must have been placed between 1AM and 7AM.  My dad set up a trip wire that night (fishing line attached to pans that would fall at make a racket) in an attempt to catch them in the act, but they did not return.  We thought that this was the end of it, since the fruiting stopped for several weeks.

-Today (August 17), a pineapple, and 20 apples.  What odd about this is that we've been on vacation all week, and my mom and brother only got home last night.  The fruit seemed pretty fresh, so it's almost like they waited til we got home to fruit us again.  Of course, it could be a couple day old, since all the fruits they throw keep pretty well.

Our current suspects include:

-some of my brother's friends.  They're the type that would find this funny

-my friends. Seems more unlikely

-Random teenagers who think it's funny (but they're spending so much money!)

-An estranged relative

-Some mysterious benefactor who is concerned that we're not getting enough fruit in our diets

-construction workers (first fruiting occurred during repaving

-neighbors across the street messing  with us - I threw a grapefruit into their yard on a dare about 10 years ago

So, please know we're not mad and are very appreciative of the free fruit.  We just want to know what the fuck is going on.

I'm collecting signatures and support of my fellow Arlingtonians? to get on the ballot; I'm running to make sure the Virginia government doesn't pass anything to impede your use of the internet, or sexuality, and try to work on issues in the recent transportation bill that was passed (like the NOVA-specific .7% sales-tax increase)

In short, and we're seeing if the Republicans would run a candidate.

If it helps my cause, Ruby (on Rails!), bash, perl, html, and css, and enjoy rainy days on my laptop looking at pictures of cats or practicing my mad Zerg skills (platinum league).

* Kabob
* No U-turn allowed more than half the time
* Bus and metro are nice
* Lots to do and see
* If you look hard enough
* Lots of beautiful young professional women, but I've noticed that they are all quite the same; skinny/underfed, fashionable, brunette, look educated, walk with a purpose, wear high boots, most are 5'-6"" and up with an unusual number being 5'-10"" and up (what's in the water here?). It reminds me of an episode of Family Guy when Chris was explaining this type of woman to his boss.
* People love to drive in your blind spot
* Everything I need is within a few blocks
* The only good mall is Tyson's Corner
* Gas is $0.20-0.30 more per gallon
* Grocery bill is higher
* People walking dogs and dog parks everywhere
* Xfinity cable customer service sucks

EDIT: Forgot a few things

* The same street has three names. Sometimes the large sign will say something like ""Braddock"" and the small sign will say ""W. Braddock"". Which one is it motherfucking sign people? Luckily you actually have a sign. Sometimes the streets are at an angle, all you see is ""Glebe"" since the ""S."" or ""W."" is in subscript.
* My GPS (Google Maps on my Android) is often just as lost as I am. When I first moved here it had me turning in circles (""make a right, make a right"" = circle). I once made a dozen lefts and rights in under two minutes and gave up on it and just followed my nose. I now choose to take what she says as an opinion, rather than an instruction.
* People cross the street wherever they feel like
* Doing a quick run to Chipotle or grocery store around 5:30PM? Good luck finding parking. 20 stores in the shopping center

Yesterday afternoon was the worst though. The car was insanely hot inside, it turned red and she didn't want to wait the 45 seconds for the cycle, and we spend an additional 5 minutes cutting through parking lots. 


It seems as though many drivers are forgetting simple slug ediquitte:

- Turn your volume down. I don't care if you want to listen to your strange folk music but I don't want it blasting in my ears. We all prefer to just keep it on WTOP. It's smart.

- Keep the damn car climate controlled. If you don't have A/C

- Clean your damn car

- If you have a carseat in the back

- If you have a small coupe, don't get huffy if someone like me doesn't want to ride in it. I'm 6' tall and have a bad knee. I'm not going to spend 1-1.5 hours folded like a sardine... it's painful.

- Don't talk on the phone

- Don't text. Our life is essentially in your hands. I **will** say something to you if you text and drive.

- Don't drive like an ass. See above.


*That being said

- First up gets first choice of seat. I don't care if you're a woman and the driver is a man. Just because he's a dude doesn't mean he's going to rape you in the front seat of a car. Have some sense.

- Turn your headphones down to a reasonable level. 

- Don't talk on the phone

- Take a shower.

- Don't get in the car right after having a cigarette. you stink up the whole car.

- If you have a large bag

- From /u/woodsbookswater : Don't douse yourself in perfume or cologne

- If you're in the front seat

We live in Northern Virginia
    
**Details of the scam:**    
- He claimed that when the power was restored to our area after the hurricane
- He said it was an emergency and that the equipment needed to be replaced immediately or we might face an explosion/house fire.    
- He said there would be a truck at our home within 10-15 minutes
- When asked if it how much it would cost/how we'd be billed
- We asked about payment
- He provided a phone number 1(888)201-8125 ext. 1604        
    
We were considerably suspicious so we called the official Dominion Virginia phone number and the number he provided.    
    
**What the secretary said at the phone number he provided**    
- The payment was due immediately    
- She knew our home address
- She could arrange the payment to be lowered to $200.    
    
**What Dominion Virginia Power told us:**    
- There was no record of a call    
- There was no issue with our equipment    
- It sounded like a bogus call.    
- Dominion doesn't have a fraud department
    
**Update**    
We filed a police report with Fairfax County PD.    
    
**Update 2**    
The person called back at 3:15 PM asking if the payment was ready. We told them that if they really wanted to
    
**Update 3**    
We contacted Fox 5 News DC. Extremely awesome people there
    
**Update 4**    
Karen Gray Houston of Fox 5 just left after interviewing us about the scammers. She asked about how we handled the situation and one of the things I mentioned was warning people about it on Reddit. She wasn't familiar with Reddit but hopefully they include my sort of shout out. I told her it was an excellent news source! She isn't sure yet if the story will air tonight or later this week.    
**Edit:** The piece aired the same night of the incident. Good work
    
**Update 5**    
The plot thickens... Karen Gray Houston has spoken to Dominion Power about this incident
    
[Airing now](http://www.myfoxdc.com/category/237285/live-newscasts)

So there are two statewide ballot questions.  The first is pertaining to the 'veto' session of the General Assembly.  It allows for a join resolution to delay the veto session by one week (currently it is required to begin on the 6th Wednesday following the close of the General Assembly to only consider vetoed legislation).  My understanding, including Passover.  Anyone against this?  And why?  I'm leaning towards voting for it but I would love to hear arguments for and against it.

The second question pertains to eminent domain and, not to sell it to private enterprises to promote economic development.  This push began after the Kelo v. City of New London decision by the US Supreme Court sided with New London, CT, allowing them to exercise eminent domain to buy private residential property for a private developer to build a shopping center and other things.  My memory is hazy but I was living in CT at the time.  I'm 50/50 on this.  What are your thoughts?

Finally there are the bond questions.  A total of four for parks and rec (not the show!), and storm and drainage.  I'm for this, but, again, would love to hear otherwise!

1352442119.0,12who3,Tales from a Fairfax County precinct,A_Suvorov,47,7,31,"I volunteered to work at a precinct polling place in my home county this year. I thought y'all might be interested how things happen here.

Poll workers start arriving at four in the morning to set up the polling place and the polling machines. We'd all been trained in this to some extent, was open and ready by six.

There was a huge morning rush as everyone tried to vote before leaving for work. This died down a lot in my precinct

This brings me to that the main challenge for us was the fact that there were two precincts voting in the same building. There was huge turnout, one of the two precincts shared its name with the polling place, so everyone who had not read their card thoroughly enough or who had simply used a ""find my polling place"" search thought they were in that precinct. And unfortunately, this precinct had a huge line. So we'd have people waiting in line for 40 minutes, getting to the front, and subsequently learning that they were in the wrong precinct when we inputted them into the computers. 

So basically, to make sure they got in the right line. I helped confused voters by looking them up in the handy AskED device that allowed me to input their name or address and it would tell me their precinct. I walked up and down the line multiple times yelling about the two precincts. A few people got mad at me. And a few of these same people walked trying to not make eye contact with me, having just been informed by the registration people that they had been waiting in the wrong line for an hour. But all in all, we were pretty successful in making sure everyone got in the right line the first time around. Interestingly, the turnout at one precinct was massive compared to the other. There was a huge discrepancy in the lines (often there wasn't even a line for the other precinct) the entire night, even without the people who were in the wrong place. Some people laughed at this, some people seemed frustrated. All the people in the precinct with the short line were delighted. 

Another issue we had was with people who had moved. Some of them had changed their address with the DMV, tip to all you voters, when you move, call both the DMV and the County/state elections office. Make sure your information gets changed *everywhere*.

We only had one voting machine malfunction all night. One of the electronic machines crashed. The voter using it at the time swore that her vote got counted

The length of the lines in the polling place peaked from 5:00 to 6:15. It slowly wound down after 6:15. Everyone who was in line by 7:00 was allowed to cast their ballots. Fortunately

After the polls closed

Also, and all the paper receipts and records. Everything had to be signed by multiple election officers. Eventually, all the results and machines and everything were boxed up and shipped away by our precinct's Chief Election Officer. 

Also

We had one guy come in and ask where he could vote for the casinos. Me and the voters standing nearby laughed as I told him ""Wrong state, turns out the guy was actually serious-the only reason he showed up was to vote for the casinos-and he turned around and left looking a little sad.

Also

Some tips for voters

-The rumors are true. It will go faster if you vote by paper ballot.

-Check your precinct number before going to your polling place. If two precincts are voting there

-Bring a book. The lines may be long.

-Try to make (non-political) conversation with the people around you in line.

-Plan ahead. Make sure you have enough time to vote.

-The elderly and disabled can do curbside voting. Call ahead or send a relative or friend in to ask an Election Officer. It goes fastest if you send a relative/friend in with your ID so that you can be checked in the computer straight away. 

-If you note that there is an Election Officer or Page or anyone else directing people in the building

-And for the love of God

Hello NoVA people.

I need to part ways with one of my best friends, and don't have the money for the $500 non refundable pet deposit for my furry man at my new apartment, and Mom says I can't afford his upkeep, anyway. In addition, I'll be moving in with my boyfriend, who is allergic.

Here's an album of him sleeping in cute positions

He's the coolest cat. A chill orange tabby that loves to run around outside if you have the space, because you can pick him up, twist him around, do anything you want, and he'll just sit there and purr, happy as anything. He's only 2 years old, about.

I am in tears writing this. I am loathe to give up such a one-in-a-million cat, and I figured some cool reddit folks might be helpful...

He'll come with food, even a brand new furminator/nail clipper combo. 

edit: here's another photo of him doing what he does best just today: http://imgur.com/dIta71L

I need help. I have been gathering signatures almost entirely on my own. Time is getting short
If you are eligible to register to vote in VA's 11th district you can circulate a petition sheet on my behalf.

I am running on a platform of:

One law for all: The powerful elite and ultra-rich live by a separate set of rules - things you and I would go to jail for they get off without any repercussions.

End ALL the wars: Iraq, the War on Terror, etc. They are not accomplishing our goals, they enrich and act as recruiting tools for our 'enemies'. They are used as bludgeon to scare the US population into sacrificing our liberties for the illusion of safety.

Civil RIGHTS, NDAA 2012, etc seek to erode our rights in the interest of the security of the corporate/government complex.

Sustainable energy: We will run out of oil as an energy source the moment our energy return on energy invested reaches 1:1. This will happen far sooner than we expect. We need to get ahead of the curve and develop sustainable energy while we have the excess capacity in the system to invest in the development of it.

Stop the looting

Those are just a couple points of my platform. I'm an independent progressively minded individual who believes in basing public policy on data and evidence of effectiveness, I am willing to change my mind. We need more average Americans challenging the powers that be in their own arena: running for public office. My interests lie at the macro level - thus I am running for office at the Federal level with no prior political experience. I am untainted and unencumbered by obligations to special interests or corporate interests.

I want to be a Congressman for the opportunity to represent American citizens and their best interest

I will do an AMA later

What attracted me to Eaton Square was the location and cost- it was considerably cheaper than Avalon

I should have realized how important a good living space is on your overall mental health then.

Avalon wanted a $500 deposit plus a $400 amenities fee- pretty steep considering we haven’t even discussed rent yet. So I went with Eaton Square.

A couple of things about the neighborhood- This is Alexandria, and Spanish music blasting from open windows.

Avalon was immune to most of this, not so much.

After signing the lease and doing the inspection, that it would ‘settle once you move your stuff in.’

My floors weren’t the only floors to squeak, or wake up and go to school.

The road, West Glebe and Mt. Vernon Ave. I heard traffic constantly.

I had noticed that the bathroom didn’t have a fan in it, I didn’t realize until a week later when I went to cook that the kitchen didn’t have a hood vent above the gas range.

A gas range with no hood vent.

Nope

Aside from the possible physical danger, guess what you have?

Roaches. 

But I’ll come back to that.

One of the sheer genius pieces of design in these apartments is that the HVAC vent intake is in the kitchen. So now you’re cooking in the kitchen with no hood vent

I like eating fish and bacon

http://imgur.com/a/Pf9F3#tirQZkV

I think Bainbridge, due to space limitations, they were pressed to find a place to put these appliances- therefore they went in the closet that had the most room.

Well

As one who cooks, old TVs, mattresses, and a mountain of trash bags. If only the management company would invest in one, just one, additional green box, you wouldn’t have things like this:

http://i.imgur.com/SmhYmAL.jpg

With trash piled on the ground like this, stray cats, dogs and one opossum. Thankfully I’ve had no rats in my apartment, but I don’t see how they haven’t been a problem.

In regards to roaches- I'm not going to be the typical disgruntled tenant and flip my shit over a bug. I’ve seen them on several occasions. The first was in the living room

The pest control company was promptly sent but after checking in my utility closet

**The Earthquake and Hurricane Flood**

If you live in Virginia, which sounds like something you would get at Dairy Queen.

It wasn’t evident until after the hurricane (which wasn’t really a bad storm at all, allowing rainwater to seep in right around my living room window.

I mopped up what I could with a towel and walked down to the leasing office to let them know about the damage and that water was coming into my apartment. The leasing consultant that I spoke to in the office said that someone would be sent to fix it.
This. Never. Happened.

Every time it rained

It was over a year before this was addressed
 
**The Bathroom Flood**

Over three days I watched the paint on my bathroom ceiling blister. I realized right away that this was because of some type of leak so I ripped the peeling paint away and felt the drywall- yep

The entire ceiling was wet and soft to the touch. I had no idea if this was waste water so after I immediately washed my hands

A week went by.

After being more than patient, I got an immediate response and someone was sent right away to fix the issue…or so I thought.

The leak was just painted over, soggy, drywall lay covering my floor, shower, sink, toilet- even on my toothbrush (I threw that away).

Again


**The Kitchen Flood**

This was the final straw. I was standing in my kitchen in early February when I heard running water. At first I thought it may have been the sound of the drain until water started pouring from directly above my counter and raining down behind my cabinets and fridge. I had to throw quite a bit of food away since it became waterlogged and again

Immediately I called the emergency line at the leasing office and left a message. I was called back within 15 minutes and was told that the ‘on call’ maintenance was in Rockville

http://imgur.com/u7izjZq

**Other things to note:**

**Common hallways** – are open to the public. The carpet in these areas are often ripped and trash/ takeout menus are usually strewn about.

**Club flyers** – People that live here are going to find a lot of these stuck under their windshield wipers or crammed in their car door window seals:

http://i.imgur.com/zi11fBJ.jpg?1

Although I had this stuck in my door jamb and liked it so much that I've held onto it ever since:

http://i.imgur.com/w4wGWuU.jpg?1

**Closet space** – is microscopic

**Key fob for gym** – I lost mine. I went down to the leasing office in person as I typically do

I came back next week

I came back next week and they still weren’t in and was told to come back the next week. I said no and gave them my phone number and email address

I was never contacted

My suspicion is if this was someone that stole my sister's keys a month ago than they have already got a buyer and the car is probably gone. But I am hopeful. I don't know if they would go and try and sell it on Craig's List. But I figured that would be a good place to sell off parts if they don't have a chop shop

I thought it would be really awesome to cook pho for the homeless one day. I'm not looking to make a profit

I posted this on my facebook back around xmas time and it was well received for people wanting to help and donate their time. Although most people just wanted to eat my pho.

If I was to picture it, others pay and the money goes towards helping the homeless get cleaned up, a bed to sleep, and a shot at a new life.

Here's the funny thing. Technically* I am homeless myself. I would be a homeless person cooking/helping the homeless

*I lost my job back in late August. That's when I started the pho post. Then had to give up my apt in December. Been a nomad ever since. Doing freelance and raising seed money for a startup now, spending a year going for it, so I can live with no regret.

Wrapping up, anywhere it was allowed. I have nothing but time to donate for a good cause. Couldn't there be a way to get a few sponsors to donate supplies and ingredients?

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

**Please do your best to not be late!** Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am. We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lanes. If you do come late

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance).

The veggies in the dishes are especially great here.  I love the shrimp with vegetables.  They have other Asian dishes on the menu as well and even make a pretty good Pad Thai.  The appetizer menu is pretty standard but they seem to put some extra care into preparation so that things always come out tasting fresher than the other places I've tried.

Please try to stop by there every few weeks if you can so that they can ride it out until the road reopens next year.  They do have a good deals on the lunch menu for those of you working in town.  They do deliveries as well.

I have three great cats, unfair to the cats. I travel a lot and two of the cats are fine in the car but the third absolutely hates it.

She's an orange tabby

She loves people and really would just prefer to hang out with a person all day, but she really is a bit needy in terms of attention. All she wants to do is be near you. A 9-5 job is fine as long as you can hang with her most evenings. She likes to ""talk"" to you as well. This is not a cat that will hide when company comes over! She loves meeting new people.

She's absolutely unfazed by dogs but generally not a fan of other cats. This is why I would prefer to rehome her as opposed to my other two cats, doesn't really mind having her nails clipped and doesn't scratch on anything excessively (the few times she does it, I use a water bottle to spray at her and this seems to be nipping that problem in the bud). She doesn't scratch or bite. Really, if she's annoyed, she'll just let out a grumble. As I type this she's curled up on the back of the couch just above my head and purring.

I would charge a fee of $50 to weed out the crazies

I'm open to her being rehomed in all areas of Virginia

Besides that

My boyfriend lives in Alexandria so that would be a good meeting space

[Here's a gallery of pictures of her.](http://imgur.com/a/3tuwv) She would be an excellent cat for a first time cat owner because she's extremely affectionate

* Time:	 	10:00 am - 12:00 pm
* Location:	Blue Ridge Arsenal

The Pink Pistols (an LGBT + friends gun education group) will be meeting on Sunday morning at 10 AM at Blue Ridge Arsenal in Chantilly. We welcome ANYONE that wants to learn about guns and get some experience. You do not have to own a gun at all.

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started. We had a several Redditors show up to the events but could accommodate more.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

Look for the Reddit sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg)
 
Please do your best to not be late! You have to fill out a form to get in and we form up groups before we go in.  If you do come late

The cost is only $10 if you can get into a group with a range member or $20 if we run out of range members.  If you have safety/sports glasses and/or earplugs/muffs bring them.  If not we can usually provide some or you can rent them.

No one that has come to these events hasn't had a good time and learned something.  Please reply here if you will be coming.

* You know those little [clamshell cookies](http://www.donsuemor.com/images/main.jpg) they sell at Starbucks? We provide those to all the Whole Foods in the DC area. You will make these. A lot of them. I hate them

* We also make various tartlets, pain au chocolat, etc. Bakery stuff, pretty much. You will contribute to those.

* We do not do cakes. If all you want to do is ice cakes, an hour after she was supposed to come in) because she just wanted to decorate cakes. 

That's pretty much it. Some experience is nice

All in all, or whatever. 

[This is the bakery I work at.](http://www.leonorabakery.com/www.leonorabakery.com/HOME.html) The number on that website is the number to call; say you heard about it through Virginia. It's at the bottom of the page on the ""Order Now!"" tab/page/whatever. No

So please, that homeless guy that hangs out on the southern side of Sycamore at Washington know that this job is open. I need relief. 

Thank you! You guys are awesome!

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started. All the Redditors that have attended the events in the past have had a great time.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

Look for the Reddit sign to find our group: [Armed Alien](http://i.imgur.com/eFH0O.jpg)
 
**Please do your best to not be late!**  Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am.  We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lane. If you do come late

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance).  If you don't bring a gun of your own please bring $10 for a pool to cover ammo costs of those that bring guns for your to shoot.

The Old Dominion Fechtschule will be starting a new 8-week beginner's course on Wednesdays beginning April 3

As a student in this class you will:
-Be introduced to the study of the longsword as well as unarmed combat techniques.
-Learn the fundamentals of a modern martial art with content derived from the works of German masters from the fifteenth century.
-Benefit from a program with a set structure and curriculum that builds on itself.



*****EDIT*****  Because of interest I have added a second beginner's class running concurrently on Sunday at 5:30pm.  This will allow those with commute problems or who cannot make a weekday evening class the opportunity to study this martial art.  Drop me a line if you'd rather participate in the Sunday class.  Thanks!


***EDIT***  The Wednesday class is now full.  The Sunday class has five slots left so if you would like to get in on this session please drop me a line right away!  I'll begin another session in June

Dear Friend:

In light of your concern regarding the “Stop Online Piracy Act” (SOPA) (H.R. 3261), S. 968. 

As you know

SOPA would authorize the Justice Department (DOJ) to sue a domain or website that “engages in, such as payment processors like PayPal and online ad networks to cut ties with said sites. SOPA would also permit regulators to require Internet service providers to block access to offending sites entirely. 

I have deep concerns with this bill. The broad nature of the language would grant unprecedented authority to the DOJ and could result in regulations that would censor websites and stifle free speech and the innovative spirit that the Internet has been built on. We need to craft and support legislation that strengthens intellectual property rights without compromising the open nature of the Internet. 

On Thursday, the House Judiciary Committee held a marathon mark-up session of SOPA. The heated mark-up provided Members the opportunity to offer amendments which would have made improvements to the bill, but all were defeated. 

The Senate version of the bill, many websites launched highly successful grassroots campaigns urging users to contact their Representatives and voice their opposition to SOPA and PIPA. In a symbolic move, a number of websites, including Wikipedia and Firefox, held a “blackout” day on Wednesday, January 18, 2012, consideration of both bills has been delayed. 

I supported these efforts and encourage your future participation in this political discourse. It is through your participation and activism that more attention was given to these bills and I look forward to working with you and my colleagues in crafting a more thoughtful piece of legislation that balances the need to protect intellectual property while preserving Internet freedom. 

Thank you again for contacting me. 

Sincerely
James P. Moran",,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/ow67p/congressman_jim_morans_response_to_sopapipa_email/

So, I'm not that narcissistic. This is a chance to start smaller groups of friends for those of you who want to find new friends with similar interests. Who knows, you might find some cool people, some people that you can benefit from, or that certain special someone that you are looking for your whole life! (yes, this time I mean me)

Here is a list of the places that will have meetups

* Arlington
* Alexandria
* Annandale - **edit: Asian Food + Karaoke**
* Vienna/Tyson's Corner
* Fairfax
* Centreville - **edit: Event + Shilla/Five Guys**
* Chantilly - **edit: Laser Tag + BBQ**
* Herndon/Reston
* Manassas/Manassas Park
* Woodbridge - **edit: Possible Potomac Nationals Game**

Newly Added:

* Sterling - **Dinner + Activity**

What I need from you:

* 1 to 4 Co-hosts per location
* Ideas from all of you for things to do
* At least 10 requests from people if they want to host a meetup at a different location like Gainesville or Sterling

Rules:

* The co-hosts will decide on the meetups being E for everyone
* I would rather not go for D. Activities or even just dinner would be nice
* I am not responsible for transportation as I doubt I will make it to all of them
* At least one co-host should plan on making one more meetup later

More seasoned shooters are welcome and encouraged to bring their guns to share and bring people into the hobby. If you are willing and able to teach others please bring some lower caliber guns to get them started.

Newbies can expect to learn proper grip, rifles, and maybe even shotguns. While this is a group that started for LGBT gun enthusiasts, we don't discuss personal issues or politics. It's not a ""dating group"" or anything like that. It's just a more or less liberal/libertarian group of people that like things that go bang.

**Please do your best to not be late!** Try to be in the lobby by 9:45am. We'll put you into a small group prior to entering so we can share lanes. If you do come late

Cost is between $10 and $20 for entry (depending upon the number of range members in attendance).

I go to the Blue Ridge Arsenal in Chantilly with the Pink Pistols group once a month on Sunday mornings at 10AM.  It's a laid back group

Pink Pistols is a gay-friendly group but the leader is a libertarian not actually gay.  Last event I went to the straight people outnumbered the LGBT folks.  It's not usually a big group but we'd like more people to come join us.  All are welcome and we never talk about personal stuff.  We are just there to have fun

Experienced shooters are welcome too.  Please bring your interesting guns and some smaller (easy to shoot) guns if you have them. Handguns

Cost is usually $10 but could be $20 for the hour if you can't share a lane with a range member.  Bring eye protection (normal plastic lens glasses are good) if you can.  We can share ear protection with you.  I can transport you from the Leesburg area if you need a ride.

Our neighbors are awesome and we're close with all of them. They're all late 20s - 30 and we all regularly enjoys going to vineyards, as well as just hanging out around our communal fire pit or pool.

You can contact me by PMing me or call my cell at 603 568 5144. 

All the best
Ian 

PS - I'm leaving for Kabul in late December so that is when the lease would start. Also our land lady unfortunately doesn't want pets in the house. ",,t5_2riyy,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/132x17/782_furnished_room_in_townhouse/

I'm looking to sublease my [basement](http://maps.google.com/maps/myplaces?ll=38.884003,-95.677068&amp;sspn=23.875,57.630033&amp;vpsrc=6&amp;ctz=240&amp;z=16&amp;iwloc=A) come October 1st. I was looking for not only a housemate, but someone with whom I might be able to geek out, share a beer on friday night, but also still wants their own space. I figured Reddit would be the place to look first, and I cleared it through the admins
  
  
**A little about me:** I'm 35f, and almost got my degree in culinary arts before I got bored and went for my CCNA. I'm a liberal who is also a former Marine; I was voted 'Mollie Marine' of my boot camp platoon. I have recently fallen in love with Game of Thrones, although Firefly still holds a strong second. Ents are embraced, stoners are not. 
  
  
**The good:** $900 a month including utilities; 25M wifi, but I stream my media server (which you're welcome to) and Hulu via my Wii.    
  
The basement is fairly large: it has a large living space, a microwave, and cabinets down there, there is no oven or stove. You would of course have full use of all common areas upstairs including the kitchen, so a late night pizza fix is no problem. Sharing is completely optional, although completely encouraged.  
  
There is a little shower area built into the washroom, I promise. No throne yet, but I may be putting in an upflush system soon.  
  
It's partially furnished, depending on what my current housemate leaves. I also have linens and pillows and pots and pans, and vacuums and a TVs you're welcome to use.   
  
There is a separate entrance around back
  
Location is awesome. We're about a mile and a half from the Vienna Metro, and the schools fucking rock. My son's middle school is one of the best public schools in the nation.   
  
**The bad:** 

The big one: at least the last 10 years this place has been lived in, this might be a dealbreaker.  If you DO have cats, there is a removable cat door built into the window. 

The place is a little old

The floors are paper thin

The traffic sucks balls, it flat out sucks at rush hour. There are ways to get around, but you're screwed if you take 66.

 We got a few estimates and we were given anywhere between 5k and 6k. Yah… Not gonna happen!

**What Happened and Lessons Learned**

•	We did it ourselves     
We actually got some people to help with the digging and a plumber to do the connections
It was a lot more stressful but cost a LOT less (saved about 4500)

•	Plan        
You'll probably want to plan it out before starting

Make sure you get a permit before starting and of course always call 811 like others have pointed out.

•	New line or fix the old?      
We decided to connect a new one. Especially considering the old line was made of these blue pipes (can’t remember its name) that are banned and no longer in use

•	Copper
We decided to go with copper since we couldn't find the correct PVC/PEX seamless (rolls) pipes, since we could only find copper we went with that.

•	The plumber      
After all the digging

We learned a LOT from this 'experience'. If you have any questions

So, of course.

The reason I'm making this thread in the NoVA subreddit is to post information about your current congressman, it's completely fine for you to talk to your congressman/woman and let him know that you support it). I feel a main reason people don't just email/call in about pieces of legislation is that they don't know how, and feel that it wouldn't be worth the time to find out how or to do it. 

Well, all the information you need to get to the offices/contact them [can be found here](http://wolf.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=164&amp;sectiontree=2,164). For convenince: the three offices are the Washington Office (phone: 220-225-5136), Herndon Office (phone: 703-709-5800), and the Winchester Office (phone: 540-667-0990). For full information including the address, directions, and fax numbers

If you would prefer to e-Mail instead of call

But your representative isn't Frank Wolf? Fair enough, and your current representative. Simply click on the representative's name and it should take to you their page, wherein you can find contact details.

If you haven't already, the more the merrier.

After being confronted by staff the individual immediately went upstairs.  To say that this was news to me would be an understatement.  He also informed me that the doors this person was attempting to open were where they store the liqueur at the Ballroom. So he has now basically accused me of trying to steal liqueur from the Ballroom.  Since I know this is not true and very clearly either a fabrication or someone else in a grey suit I immediately ask to come down to the Ballroom to see the tapes.  This is where he informs me that the tapes had either already been taped over or were no longer working
Now
The whole things seems even fishier than before.


UPDATE #1:  I spoke with Nick of the Ballroom this morning over the phone.  He was very polite and offered to look into what happened.  Apparently AJ was not the manager that night and so he is confused as to what actually happened as well and he is going to find to what happened.  He also offered to have me and my friends back as his guests and would take care of us that evening.  So it seems that something very strange happened with the security staff that evening and Nick apologized profusely and offered to make it right.  

Last evening, got our reentry stamps and went to the bar.  After about two beers I excused myself and went to the restroom downstairs and then stepped outside for a smoke.  It was still relatively early, about 10:30 as the DJ had only been playing for about a half hour.  I stood outside in the rain, had my smoke and then went to go back inside.  
This is where the fun began.  When I tried to get back inside the bouncer informed me that there was no reentry that evening.  This seemed strange to me as the Ballroom has always let people out to smoke and come back in, which was parked in Shirlington.  I plugged it in and waited for it to charge.  As it charged I drove back to Ballston as at this point my friends inside had no idea where I was.  As I drove past the Ballroom I saw them outside smoking and thought “Aha! They will not be able to reenter either and we can then go somewhere else.”  
After I parked I walked up to the Ballroom and my friends were not out front
The manager
Needless to say at this point I was perplexed.  I kept my cool and waited for my friends to come out to have another smoke.  When they did I explained the situation and they asked the bouncer why I was not allowed back in and he stated that he did not know and that he was simply following orders.  
I am very confused as to exactly what happened last evening.
Was there anything I could have done to make this situation better?  I realize that once they make the decision to kick you out you are not getting back in

 TLDR ~ A non-violent, paying customer was denied readmission to the Ballroom after smoking outside and was never given a reason as to why his reentry was denied.

Official press release below.

Pro-Choice Activists Call Cuccinelli’s Bluff: Save Abortion Clinics or Lose Hospitals

An activist working with Oppose TRAP has submitted a petition calling into question the legality of the current regulations of most Virginia hospitals. Taking Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli at his word

In 2011 the Virginia General Assembly passed SB924, the regulations as written by Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli’s office required clinics to undergo extremely costly structural upgrades to parking spaces, hallways widths, awnings, etc. These medically unnecessary requirements come from three chapters of a manual called the 2010 Guidelines for Design and Construction of Health Care Facilities, and are unrelated to women’s health and safety.

These regulations were expected to permanently close the doors of at least 75% of the abortion clinics in the state.1 After public protest and outspoken opposition from the medical community made clear the dire consequences of Ken Cuccinelli’s position

In response

The Board of Health capitulated

The facility guidelines for hospital construction clearly state they are “intended as minimum standards for designing and constructing new health care facility projects.” When it was pointed out that these are not new facilities

Since that time

Now, who could feel uncomfortable being associated with a legal process that has the potential to shut down health care facilities. They cannot afford to alienate their allies in the medical community.

Oppose TRAP appreciates these concerns. “Access to health care is something we all value very highly, political and social consequences are so severe that there is not a real threat to general hospitals. “That is the whole point. It is absurd. Cuccinelli needs to explain how it isn’t or own up to what he has done.”

Molly Taylor Vick notes that participation in the public comment period does not equal support for the petition. “People are encouraged to use their voices to express their individual concerns

She further contends that this is taking the fight to where Ken Cuccinelli pretends it is - in the legal interpretation and application of law. “He must own this.”

Cuccinelli can not selectively apply the law:

If existing hospitals CANNOT be grandfathered in under new regulations

If existing hospitals CAN be legally grandfathered as they always have been

VDH must either act to amend hospital regulations to require current construction code of existing facilities or readdress the issue of grandfathering as applied to abortion clinic facilities.

I hate to let my bed go because its uber comfy but there is no reasonable way for me to get it to CA with me =/.

Bonus: I'll throw in one ticket to Fun. on the 31st if a Redditor buys the bed

Thanks.
