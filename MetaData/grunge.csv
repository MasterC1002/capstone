1346874796.0,zeqji,"""It's never too late."" My trip to Seattle with my aging mother.",my_brother_jed,63,12,12,"Last year I took a trip up I-5 to visit family in and around Seattle with my mother (She's 68 and I'm 35). We live in a shitty little town called Vancouver Washington about 2 and half hours south. We hit the freeway and I asked

""You wanna listen to some music?""

""Sure but nothing too screamy. Can we listen to something good?"" my mother replies. 

""Yeah no problem.""
Every time i take the trip north to Seattle its ritual for me to listen to the ""Seattle sounds"" the whole trip. It's nostalgic and

[I start with Mad Season](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mo2hap15J1I&amp;feature=fvst)

So I begin to tell her about Layne Staley and his story

She loves the music. How could you not?

""This is grunge?"" she asks.

""This is part of it

""I had no idea""

Inevitably the conversation now turns to Nirvana and Kurt Cobain
We listened to the whole album. She loved it. 

So now I am racing through the playlist [Mother Love Bone](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kNS9EeGHz6I&amp;feature=fvst), my experience with the bands and the songs and what they mean to me, and for the first time we speak of my troubled youth and the dark places that i took myself, and how the music helped me cope and perhaps saved my life more than once. 

It's the first time we've ever had this talk. We just didnt speak about it. I'm 35 years old and have children of my own and had thought the time for this had passed. We spent the rest of the trip north speaking to one another about ""that time"" taking pause to switch the playlist and enjoy more music. 

With all the emotions flying around the car and and memories of my youth she breaks into tears while listening to [Alive](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wGiTPgvKktM). 

""I'm sorry Tyler"" she cries ""This song reminds me of you.""
I never met my father. When i was 12 she told me that the man that i thought was my father

We shared tears and music

On the way back to Vancouver the next day when we got into the car I turned on the radio to a local contemporary station thinking that she's appreciate listening to something she enjoys.

""I thought we were going to listen to more of your music. I like the Soundgarden guy his voice is haunting and beautiful

""SURE!"" I'm happy to oblige....I put in [Badmotorfinger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0iOzWxPmNg). 
""Let's Jam!""

My mom calls me from Texas every day (she has since moved away) and keeps asking me for more music and telling me about the bands that she has discovered, Smashing Pumpkins, Blind Melon, Screaming Trees....etc. Her Zune is filled with grunge and other rock and metal that she has come to appreciate and love from our little trip north. She turns 69 years old this year, and her attitude has taken on a certain slight ""edge"". I fucking love this woman with all my heart. I love the music with all my heart. Thank you Layne, thank you Kurt, Thank you Andrew. Thank you for helping bring a mother and son together after so many years.....

It's never too late. 

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the positive feedback. ""One good thing about music,False,self,t5_2r11c,1346966028.0,,,t3_zeqji

I have learnt so much from people posting bands iv never heard before

I have always that little race of joy when someone posts a classic and everyone digs it

I love the fact that i haven't seen one person shot down for their personal tastes and style.

And the consistent epic content that comes through this is seriously uplifting


I feel that this part of reddit is my home where i can kick back with fellow grunge fans and speak my mind upon the music i love and the fans i love chatting too about Grunge as a whole. 

so from one loser to another 

Thankyou.

You can pick some flair that has already been added (there should be a button for it near your name at the top of the sidebar) or you can find and album cover you like

That's all for now.

Edit: I leave this up for a while and do them all at once later.

Edit 2: should have these sorted soon so you can pick whichever you'd like.",self,t5_2r11c,1374592419.0,,sp,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/grunge/comments/1iqzo8/hey_losers_want_some_flair/

Dedicated loser Teeds has collected a few things you might find interesting that we shall be trickling out over the next few days, so throw on some AIC and piss off the neighbours!

Here is the link to the Layne Staley website

Also don't forget to check out the [Sing For Layne](http://www.singforlayne.com/) site which is kicking off 8pm EST (or when this post is 4 hours old).

One thing that will (hopefully) be done is the background of the sub will be changed to a tribute of Mr. Staley. It is in this that I would ask for your help...

We are looking for anyone who can create a fitting tribute to him so we can use it as the background image for the month of april. It can be done in any form from a pencil sketch to some photoshop wizardry just so long as we can get it online. 

Aside from that if you aren't able to do something like that please visit this [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/picrequests/comments/rbu6m/request_from_rgrunge/) in [/r/picrequests](/r/picrequests) and give it a little upvote so it can get some exposure (I receive no karma if you are worried about that sort of thing.)

Thanks again people remember it is you lot who make this place as awesome as it is. If you ever have any concerns or ideas don't hesitate to get in touch.


Edit: [Gotta love reddit sometimes.](http://i.imgur.com/rTleV.png) Please go to the picrequest link above and give user:BobHHowell all the karmas (a quick thank you post would be nice too :P) Still accepting any others btw this image can be our banner but we could still use something for the background or if you just feel like showing your respects in image form we will find a place of pride for it.",self,t5_2r11c,True,,sp,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/grunge/comments/rbuyv/hey_fellow_losers_i_come_once_again_seeking_your/

So it's over

There were so many tough matches but through sheer determination and (on my part) many crates of booze a winner emerges...and it is the almighty and ever rocking **Alice In Chains**. \m/

So how should we recognise them, such as having some sort of awesomely done photo of said kings that we can set on high above the sidebar. What do you think?

So to that end I want to know who the artsy people are

After all it is you guys who make [/r/grunge](/r/grunge) so awesome.

&gt;I moderate several genre-specific subreddits, it's simply a collection of related subreddits that all have a standardized drop-down menu with a complete list of related subreddits, sorted by genre. The more subreddits that join the network, the better it is for everyone.  
The SFWPorn Network has proven that sharing traffic in this way benefits everyone involved. Larger subreddits benefit because their users find out about related subreddits they might not otherwise have found on their own. Smaller subreddits benefit from the traffic sent to them from the larger subreddits. Brand-new subreddits benefit because being part of a network ensures that subscribers will come. Everyone benefits because the wider community diversifies and prospers.
Here are all of the subreddits involved with the project thus far
6.5k - /r/metalcore  
2.7k - /r/grunge  
2.1k - /r/rock  
2.0k - /r/folkmetal  
1.8k - /r/deathmetal  
1.8k - /r/melodicdeathmetal  
1.3k - /r/hardrock  
0.5k - /r/numetal  
0.3k - /r/symphonicblackmetal    
If any of you mod a rock, please let me know, and I will help you set it up.

-syncretic

----------------------------------------------
We will be messing with the colours to make the menu look better/fit with the rest of the page.

The header labeled ""Bands"" is supposed to be for bands with their own subreddit (see /r/AliceInChains or /r/Nirvana for example) so I would ask of you awesome people to either find other related band pages we can link there and if there isn't one and you want to create one (Mudhoney could use one perhaps?) go right ahead the mods here will be glad to help you with that should you need it.

So that's about it I think

Leadbelly was this poor black man in the early 1900s who went to jail a few times for wife-beating and robbery and getting into fights and bootlegging liquor.

Leadbelly became an apprentice with Blind Lemon Jefferson and started recording songs, but none of the commercial recordings he made ever captured his true essence, except for these late sessions. They happened when this guy who'd been following his career for a few years caught him on a two-track tape recorder one night when they were hanging out at this hotel. It's just really cool.
I hope that my songs approximate that honesty. That's what I strive for. He was like the first punk rocker: he'd get into town, get beat up and then go to jail because of it. So it's really cool to hear this music, especially the air of the recordings themselves, because it's so eerie to hear it on this crackly two-track.
But that's what Folkway records are like - they're awesome. They even have the entire Watergate tapes available as a 10-album set. I'm gonna get a Folkways tattoo next to my Black Flag tattoo.""

Quite a character you might say.

This week's(or should I say this 9 month's) album is [""Combat Rock""](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combat_rock) by the punk rock band

This album was released in 1982

I will probably continue to update this every Friday

EDIT: from decman:

I'd just like to add that this is in my personal top 10 albums. Here are some choice tracks to enjoy.

[Straight To Hell](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bkyCrx4DyMk)

[Ghetto Defendant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=raGsgsuPFAw)

[Sean Flynn](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aSWUKOPTt2g)

Combat Rock is a great album showing the variety of music styles that The Clash used (to great effect might i add).

Anyway point is I asked Raerth about it and he suggested we put forward our favourite ""New Album of the Week"" (you can see the section in the link above). 

So folks have at it! Nominate an album *from this year* in the comments and give a few words as to why it deserves the honour. 

**We have ~24h hours to pick one.**

Let's show these larger music subs there is still new grunge that is worth listening to.

Well

Thanks to the idea of u/fullonrapist42

The awesomest drummer (and even nicer guy) ever contacted us back

So, please support this magnificient Euro-merican project by coming along.

We will more than possibly be playing at the Cobalt Cafe in Northridge on the 26th too since we're at it... but that's not confirmed yet.

If you can't make it but our story has moved you

If you're undecided whether or not to go

There are some more tracks and covers in our soundcloud page that you're more than welcome to give a listen.
