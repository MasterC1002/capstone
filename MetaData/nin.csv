It's really interesting to hear the back story of the industrial scene

Interviews with a few well informed dudes gives some pretty good insight as to why exactly Trent Reznor is such a groundbreaking artist.  The best thing about it is that it doesn't focus so much on his personal life (actually only skimming over the details). Instead, some of the thought process behind it, the influence, etc.

I tell everyone who is interested in seriously getting into Nine Inch Nails to start at the beginning.

First of all, moods, struggles, emotions, etc. The better you know the artist, the better you can understand the art, particularly when it’s such a personal journey.

PRETTY HATE MACHINE (1989) - His pilot project. At the time he was working in a Cleveland music studio doing engineering. The manager would let him use the facility after hours to make his own stuff. He said he was trying to make a pop album at the time, the lyrics were still very dark, a foreshadowing of what was to come.

BROKEN (1992) - Written during his battle with his label TVT and later Interscope over his creativity, an influence of industrial founder Peter Christopherson of Coil and Throbbing Gristle, and Ministry frontman Al Jourgensen both of whom he collaborated with during this time. He was even going so far into experimentation as to mess with phasing on the album, hence the warning against listening on mono devices.

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL (1994) - A concept album about a man's descent into nothing. Themes of self-destruction, rebellion, using, ultimately going into hopelessness, misery, and suicide. Trent had already contemplated suicide, and at this time he was an alcoholic and addicted to cocaine, he had isolated himself in his New Orleans’s and Los Angeles residences. The TDS era is when he was basically hitting bottom. Musically he had perfected ""the beauty of dissonance"" with this album. Grating guitars

THE FRAGILE (1999) - Trent's grandmother who raised him had recently died. He was deep into his addiction which had hampered his creativity for five years since TDS. Another concept album, having firmly mastered dissonance, harmony began to make its way into his writing.

The next four albums while still personal were much more fan oriented

WITH TEETH (2005) - After two grueling tours to support The Fragile, started exercising and made peace (as best he could) with his label. With Teeth is probably the most rock-radio friendly of NIN's albums. He not only changed his lyrical and writing style but also his musical style. Definitely not as dissonant as his previous works it still had elements of experimentalism, utilizing unpopular and unusual analog sounds. He also became more political. After the world shocking events of 9/11 and the controversies of the Bush administration, songs like The Hand That Feeds hinted at things to come.
 
YEAR ZERO (2007) - The last album Trent wrote under contract. His mind was now clear for a grand project. Year Zero was released along with an alternate reality marketing campaign that started during 2006's With Teeth tour. Painting a picture of a world he believed we were heading for, war, greed, torture, religion, pollution, supernatural intervention, it reflected Reznor's growing collaboration with Atticus Ross.

GHOSTS (2008) - A completely different concept, no lyrics, just to see what they could come up with. After the success of the web based YZ marketing campaign, and after having dealt with major label BS for so long, Trent wanted to release the album to his fans the fairest way possible. The result, was releasing the first fourth of the album for free in MP3 format online, and offering different versions of the complete album for purchase online, $15 cheaper than if the album had been released on iTunes

THE SLIP (2008) - With Reznor wanting to move on to other projects (including matrimony) he foresaw the end of devoting all of his time to Nine Inch Nails. The Slip was pretty much a straight forward collection of songs and instrumentals. Somewhat like With Teeth in that there was no overall theme

In 2009 Trent decided to retire from touring Nine Inch Nails. The final tour consisted of gigs at various NYC

While this list includes only the studio albums, EPs, live performances, and music videos under NIN's ""halo"" numbering schematic. All of which have a story of their own.

I tell everyone who is interested in getting into Nine Inch Nails to start at the beginning.

First of all, moods, struggles, emotions, etc. The better you know the artist, the better you can understand the art, particularly when it’s such a personal journey.

PRETTY HATE MACHINE - His pilot project. At the time he was working in a Cleveland music studio doing engineering. The manager would let him use the facility after hours to make his own stuff. He said he was trying to make a pop album at the time, the lyrics were still very dark, a foreshadowing of what was to come.

BROKEN - Written during his battle with his label TVT and later Interscope over his creativity, an influence of industrial founder Peter Christopherson of Coil, and Al Jourgensen of Ministry, both of whom he collaborated with during this time. He was even going so far into experimentation as to mess with phasing on the album, hence the warning against listening on mono devices.

THE DOWNWARD SPIRAL - A concept album about a man's descent into nothing. Themes of self-destruction, rebellion, using, ultimately going into hopelessness, misery, and suicide. Trent was struggling with suicidal depression, and at this time he was an alcoholic and addicted to cocaine, he had isolated himself in his New Orleans and Los Angeles residences. The TDS era is when he was basically hitting bottom. Musically he had perfected ""the beauty of dissonance"" with this album. Grating guitars

THE FRAGILE - Trent's grandmother who raised him had recently died. He was deep into his addiction which had hampered his creativity for five years since TDS. Another concept album, having firmly mastered dissonance, harmony began to make it's way into his writing.

The next four albums while still personal were much more fan oriented

WITH TEETH - After two grueling tours to support The Fragile, started exercising and made peace (as best he could) with his label. With Teeth is probably the most rock-radio friendly of NIN's albums. He not only changed his lyrical and writing style but also his musical style. Definitely not as dissonant as his previous works it still had elements of experimentalism, utilizing unpopular and unusual analog sounds. He also became more political. After the world shocking events of 9/11 and the controversies of the Bush administration, songs like The Hand That Feeds hinted at things to come.
 
YEAR ZERO - The last album Trent wrote under contract. His mind was now clear for a grand project. Year Zero was released along with an alternate reality marketing campaign that started during 2006's With Teeth tour. Painting a picture of a world he believed we were heading for, war, greed, torture, religion, pollution, supernatural intervention, it reflected Reznor's growing collaboration with Atticus Ross.

GHOSTS - A completely different concept, no lyrics, just to see what they could come up with. After the success of the web based YZ marketing campaign, and after having dealt with major label BS for so long, Trent wanted to release the album to his fans the fairest way possible. The result, was releasing the first fourth of the album for free in MP3 format online, and offering different versions of the complete album for purchase online, $15 cheaper than if the album had been released on iTunes

THE SLIP - With Reznor wanting to move on to other projects (including matrimony) he foresaw the end of devoting all of his time to Nine Inch Nails. The Slip was pretty much a straight forward collection of songs and instrumentals. Somewhat like With Teeth in that there was no overall theme

Nine Inch Nails final tour consisted of gigs at various L.A. venues across which pretty much the entire NIN catalog was played.

This list includes only the studio albums. There have been many soundtrack releases, live performances, and music videos under NIN's ""halo"" numbering schematic. All of which have a story of their own.

Since retiring NIN in 2010, he has hinted he will release more Nails music in the future...

An event happens which causes the man to ultimately decide that nothing can stop him because he doesn't care anymore. We assume it's the ending of a meaningful relationship (Piggy). 

Eventually

 After this

He cannot trust any women, he has sex with a woman constantly with no commitment (Closer). 

He has a voice in his head that tells him to stop this negativity he's causing on himself

Over time, it's better than being broken and bruised (The Becoming).

The main cause of his downward spiral is brought up again, he doesn't know what to do with himself. So much at once (I Do Not Want This). 

He just.. Snaps. He commits murder with a gun. Violently his built up rage

He feels calm.. It's out of his system. With this out of the way

Not exactly.. Slowly, and end it all. He screams to God, begging to be killed due to his strong regret.. Because he is too cowardly to kill himself. He wishes to be erased from the pages of life (Eraser)

Over time.. There's nothing left of him. He couldn't believe how easy it was

Finally.. His final thoughts are brought into play. Depending on if he did kill himself,False,self,t5_2qhwq,False,,,t3_1dgfie

The link contains a DL for a .zip'ed file of of mp3s
Some tracks worth noting are:

-Sunspots (never performed s far as I know)

-Home (always a treat)

-Not So Pretty Now 

-Deep (It just sounds REALLY GOOD here)

-Dead Souls 

-Suck (I always preferred this live)

-Piggy

-Right Where it belongs (non-album version)

I am fairly new to Nine Inch Nails, discover more of their albums, but I have no idea where to start. Is there any 'route' that would be appropriate? I'm asking this because I'm a big fan of Radiohead, if you learn Radiohead in a particular order of albums, you might get the wrong idea of them. I don't want to ruin my idea of Nine Inch Nails. 
Would you have any advice on how to move on?

So **TL/DR** in advance

1. “Mr. Self Destruct”: On a Sunday morning, well, utterly self-destructive. By the end of the song, the overwhelming impulse to commit atrocious acts of violence has taken over completely, much like the distortion in the song has. Overly angst-ridden teenager has made up his mind. He grabs a set of car keys and makes his way to the garage…
2. “Piggy”: Once inside the garage, as well as justified for the actions he is about to commit. He nonchalantly passes by a police officer, smiling as he does, only feeling more grandiose about what is about to occur. By the end of the song, Mr. Self Destruct has arrived at a local church nearby…
3. “Heresy”: He walks into the foyer of this place of worship, and cackling with a sense of twisted retribution, Mr. Self Destruct begins his rampage – his ultimate downward spiral. 
4. “March of the Pigs”: Running out of the building, the police pull over and arrest the wrong person in a similar car. “Justice” is brought to the city, and now they can all sleep soundly, for everything is alright. 
5. “Closer”: Mr. Self Destruct needs to lay low for a while, he slips drugs in her drink, and they proceed to have questionably-consensual, wildly animalistic and borderline grotesque filthy sex. She lets him violate her, and he feels her from the inside. Again, and again and again.
6. “Ruiner”: After the wild and animalistic
7. “The Becoming”: …No. Mr. Self Destruct – or rather the resurfacing of the overly angst-ridden that had been consumed – is the problem. But there’s nothing the young lad can do at this point. He is in a state of becoming
8. “I Do Not Want This”: The teenager enters a reflective state and a state of desire as he realizes there is nothing he can do to overcome Mr. Self Destruct. But even when he feels the desire for alleviation from his control is strong and authentic
9. “Big Man with a Gun”: In an effort to make known who is really in control, nothing can stop him now. He’s gonna come all over you, him and his fucking gun. 
10. “A Warm Place”: The teen sits down and enjoys one of his last moments of agency, and he knows he has no one but himself to blame. But just as he thinks this, he begins to recall the only other person that had made him feel before. The woman at the strip club…
11. “Eraser”: But as the fond recollection of this woman becomes sheer abhorrence for his own existence
12. “Reptile” …He comes to realize that, his precious whore – she was all he had left, and now he has nothing. 
13. “The Downward Spiral”: As the joint being – angst ridden, accepting the suicidal fate towards which he has brought himself, he slashes his body with the hunting knives attached to his hips, and shoots himself in the head. 
14. “Hurt”: And as the camera pans away from our anti-protagonist

Hello
I'm inquiring to find out how rare the mercer high 1983 yearbook is, [name removed]. They graduated same year, and my uncle gave it to me when I was about 13. At any rate, I'm sure you're aware at what original photos are included within, and I am most definitely open to selling it, as I am aware that not many of these original yearbooks are in existence or in circulation. If either you or anyone you know would be interested in purchasing, I will accept any reasonable offer. Contact me via email when it is convenient for you.

Thank you
[name removed]

Ok, because as far as I know they are not currently in circulation (pretty sure they are - Jay), and the same goes for a few more photos in the yearbook that i havent taken pics of, and I will leave it to the future owner of this book to publicize them or not. In the back there is a whole page of senior signatures, and his signature is included in there. It goes without saying, that this yearbook is well worth it to any collector looking to own a real piece of history.

My apologies, but coming from the standpoint of a fan and being someone who loves nerdy little tidbits, I thought that's an awesome thing to share...

Almost seems plausible with how crazy the government is getting. I thought it relevant when it first came out, but if this keeps up

Best song I've *ever* seen performed at any concert I've been to, as you can see at around 2:00 in. The atmosphere was staticy, everyone in the venue was either incredibly panicked or incredibly excited, and all of it just happened to fall right on one of the eeriest and nerve racking NIN songs there is. The tension in the air was palpable as *fuck*.

There really is no other feeling like it. I've never felt like that before and I probably never will again. It was so surreal. But I'm glad I caught it on camera for the most part.

NIN has literally saved my life at bad times and I would like to help someone in return.

I know Scala isnt fully wheelchair accessible but I will find a way to cope if only I can find a way to get there...

What is gutting is there were fanclub tickets. I left the fanclub (spiral) in 2007 as disabled people were excluded from presales and had to buy separately. No step-free access to a fan meet&amp;greet was the last straw; I left feeling disenchanted. Waste of money as I couldnt access fan events.
