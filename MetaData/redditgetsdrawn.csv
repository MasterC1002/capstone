First of all, huh? One of our artists made it to the front page of [/r/all](/r/all) this morning - I'm pretty sure that's the first time that's ever happened!

Secondly

The purpose of this post is to take your temperature on a suggestion I saw in a comment thread. The complaint is that it's too difficult to find completed works of art

1) It requires a lot more modding to go through and delete unnecessary comments (which will happen)

2) I want to see how you guys feel about it first.

I assume people will have questions for the OP

Some common conversations include: 

- questions about media/material

- critiques on art pieces

Other points of discussion can also be:

- suggestions on pricing for particular works

- any other forms of art and creativity that artists may have and would like to share

- just about anything you want to talk about; seriously it's an open forum

As he often does

He contributed to our [Pose Request Day](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/1acude/pose_request_day_please_upvote_for_visibility/) this week and asked for people who were making sour faces. The results were incredible.

Another favorite artist of ours, and [this](http://i.imgur.com/3vVvSW1.jpg) was bertonnon's response.

In addition to the sour-face thread

""That's adorable!"" and ""You should illustrate children's books!""

1366313567.0,1cmjas,Drumroll please...it's time for our big announcement! Details inside. Please upvote this post for visibility.,ItWillBeMine,109,15,45,"As we mentioned in our last [State of the Union post

One of the recurring comments and requests we get is regarding that of compensation. This is a free sub, the mods here are attached to the artists, and we want to help our artists get the compensation they deserve while keeping things unchanged in this sub.

Solution: We've started a brand-new sister sub

1. Only those who have won Artist of the Week can post there. This serves the purpose of making sure the art posted in that sub is of high quality (or mod-approved quality, who would loathe our list? Have you seen our list?). Accordingly, we'll be adding a new approved submitter each week, as we award a new artist each week, so the pieces will continually change as items get sold and new artists are added. One other benefit of only using our AOTW is that we know them (to some degree), and trust them to deliver art once they are paid.

2. Payments will be accepted via PayPal or Etsy shops only (for now). So

3. The comment threads are not as strict in that sub as they are here. Feel free to ooh and ahh over the pieces of art

4. Both artists and buyers who have successfully completed a sale (actually bought something and/or actually delivered something) will get flair that says ""trusted seller"" or ""trusted buyer.""

5. There isn't much over there right now because I_may_be_dead is currently the only approved submitter - artists

6. Price has to be in the title, etc.

7. Artists of the Week don't *have* to post in the other sub, funisher does landscapes, I believe. So, portraits, landscapes, fantasy...all genres are welcome.

That's all for now! Keep checking back - we're super excited about this

Also, select and post their pieces, etc. We're hoping to have several up by 24 hours from now. :)

Update: So far there are pieces posted by I_may_be_dead and HotDinnerBatman

Double update: We've posted over in [r/newreddits](http://www.reddit.com/r/newreddits/comments/1cmqhs/rrgdgetsbought_a_sub_where_you_can_buy_art_from/) to get the word out about BOTH subs!

Once a month

1. We removed downvotes this month, downright good. Taking away the downvote option seems to have helped that issue a great deal.

2. We've instituted a new rule that watermarks aren't allowed for photos.

3. We recently began requiring verification for NSFW posts

4. Artists

5. Please remember to use the report button when you see abusive comments aimed at either artists or submitters - we'll see the comments eventually

That's all we have! We love to hear your feedback. While it's not always guaranteed that all opinions/ideas will be implemented

Thanks! We wouldn't have this sub without all of you! Remember to stay tuned each Sunday for Artist of the Week and each Wednesday for Theme of the Week. :)

Edit: Here is a tentative weekly schedule of mod posts we're considering

Sunday: Artists of the Week (one artist per week is recognized and featured)

Monday: Model Mondays (Artists can post specific requests for photos they're looking for)

Tuesday: Tearful Tuesday? (This name sucks. A roundup of posts from the last week that didn't get a response)

Wednesday: Theme of the Week (all photos must match a different theme

Thursday:

Friday:

Some common conversations include:

- questions about media/material

- tutorials and technique

- critiques on art pieces

Other points of discussion can also be:

- suggestions on pricing for particular works

- any other forms of art and creativity that artists may have and would like to share

- just about anything you want to talk about; seriously it's an open forum

Here's the skinny: Pose Request Day is a thread posted once weekly that allows artists to request the types of models and/or poses they want.

We (the mods) tried this intermittently for a while and didn't really get good results. So

Some want to see it continue, we'll be posting this thread every Wednesday to see what kind of response it gets. This is Week 2. If you want Pose Request Day to continue, make sure to post a request (**and then please follow through with your art**), and/or check the requests to see if you have one or more photos you can contribute to existing requests. Please only post photos that pertain to the request (if someone asks for photos of nude women and you post a photo of a man in suspenders shaking his fist at the camera, it will be removed).

If you don't want it to continue or you don't care about Pose Request Day

For clarification in terms of the RGD schedule

Every Sunday: Artist of the Week (one artist whose work was exceptionally good over the past week is selected and featured). Posted by myself.

Every Monday: Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts (posts from the prior seven days that did not receive art are listed all in one place - like fish in a barrel!). Posted by ChillPenguins.

Every Wednesday (for the next lil' bit

At the beginning of each month: Model of the Month (one submitter whose photos were awesome is recognized and rewarded - the purpose is to encourage high-quality submissions in this sub). Posted by meeps114.

In the middle of each month: State of the Union (purpose is to discuss current and upcoming goings-on in the sub). Posted by myself.

Enough housekeeping - go go gadget requests!

For those of you who are unfamiliar with this post, and the lurkers/viewers) to discuss the sub, how things are going, and changes that are going to be made.

We pride ourselves on being (at least a little) more diplomatic than most of the other subs on Reddit, such as:

1. Our fancy

2. Our Artist of the Week feature

3. The removal of extraneous comments

4. The creation of a sub for artists to sell their work

5. Our Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts Post :)

There have also been suggestions that we've listened to but have decided not to go with (Pose Request Day just doesn't seem to be happenin'

With all that said

1. Modding. Three out of four of our active mods are having some fairly serious life events at the moment (some good, and the other one is fairly busy as well. You may have noticed that over the past month, faulty posts and comments take longer to get removed. We'd like to add another mod to the mix. Anyone interested? Write to the mods and tell us why you're interested. :) **Please note: ONLY applications that are sent to the mods (via the ""message the mods"" link in the sidebar) will be considered. If they are posted  here, they are discarded. If they are sent to only one mod via PM, they are discarded.** We'll look at applications for the next several days, and maybe one day soon you'll see a new name (or maybe even two?) over there on the list-o-mods ---&gt;

Warning: Modding sounds exciting, so you'd have to ask yourself if you're okay with those things.

2. The report button. Because the sub has gotten so large and many of our mods are so busy

3. /r/RGDGetsBought: What does everyone (sellers

4. Pose Request Day: Nixed. Officially. We are sorry. We may bring it back in the future

5. Up for discussion: Graveyard O' Forgotten posts. Lately many of our hard-hitting regulars have been absent. I am almost beginning to think that there is somewhat of a curse to Artist of the Week

The ratio of artists to submissions seems less than optimal (at least, so the next week we post this big list and all the artists attack it at the expense of the current week's posts, which adds to the problem and creates a big list for next week, etc. 

Graveyard is quite popular and I'm sure many would like to keep it - I'm just musing that without enough artists

6. What is a feature we could add to the sub that would make it more fun for you?

I believe that's all we had for this week! Thanks very much to all of you for being here and for everything you do. There are many people out there who love this sub as much as we do - we've got a great thing going! I really love this little corner of Reddit. Happy Wednesday!

1358437812.0,16r815,State of the Union - please read and upvote for visibility (I receive no karma for this post),ItWillBeMine,76,12,83,"Hi everyone

I've been doing this informally for a while now, discuss possible changes, listen to your likes and dislikes, etc. While it does not mean that any changes will be immediately made, we do guarantee that we will listen to your feedback and take it into account when making future decisions in this community.

So...how are things for you? Artists, feel free to share your likes and dislikes. 

Here are some additional potential discussion points:

1. One artist recently posted a piece, and that's part of what makes it special. However, surely we all agree that the wonderful artists here should be paid if they want to. What do you guys think of that? Should artists be able to link to merchandise when they submit?

2. We would like a way to showcase a gallery for each artist

3. This isn't really a discussion point so much as a new rule (though we're happy to listen to any feedback) - many submitters lately don't get a response on a photo, in order to keep things fresh for the artists and not clog the front page with stale images. What say ye? One of our mods suggested that we could allow reposted images as long as new images are provided as well, so that's another option.

4. We're thinking about removing photos in which the person has a partially chopped off head. Who's excited??? There may be more rules in the future for submitters in terms of photo quality, and I think implementing this rule will actually fix a lot of problems. And by ""problems,"" I mean all those partially-headed photos we get every day. :)

5. Quick review of the rules: I just want to mention some rules that get broken multiple times a day, it doesn't hurt to mention them again, so here we go: 

Users are only allowed to post once every 48 hours. This keeps people from getting too greedy. Pretty girls in particular tend to have good luck and then turn around and post immediately after. Let's give the kids, pets, and not-so-pretty girls a chance too, shall we? ;)

A lot of posters are submitting personal info, even if they don't.

Comments in threads are for artistic contributions only, but hitting on/flirting with submitters isn't allowed. While compliments can be nice, that's not what this subreddit is for. People post here because they want art, and because the line between compliementary and creepy and wanted and unwanted compliments is so difficult to distinguish, it's best just not to do it.

Same goes for abusive comments: ""You're fat, and repeat offenders are banned after being warned. Submitters should feel like they can post here and not get a lot of insults.

And finally, it's very clear. Any art that was truly given an effort isn't removed. If it's clearly a joke and it's terrible, it is removed. Sometimes it's hard to decide what's what, so the mods rely on the community to help. If you see something that looks like troll art, please downvote it. When it gets into the negatives and we agree, we remove it (and sometimes faster than that if it's very obvious). If the person says something like ""I haven't drawn in years, sorry for the quality

Re: treatment of the mods. We understand that few of you will probably agree with 100% of the information on this page, but ideally, in terms of communication, if we have a disagreement, we will all discuss it calmly and come to a resolution if possible. This is a good thing to keep in mind going forward. I always hate it when I see other users being mean to the mods, as all of us really love this sub and work our asses off every day to spend a lot of time here and keep the quality high.

That's all I can think of for now! Please let us know anything you'd like - open forum is open! ;)

Every month, and we often ask for your opinions and thoughts on matters if the mods are undecided/on the fence as a group.

Although there are certain parts of the sub that are not up for change at the moment

With that said

1. CHECK OUT OUR NEW BANNER! Isn't it...isn't it beaauuuutiful? Special thanks go out to yowtfyo (for the idea of celebrating our recent Artists of the Week, ChillPenguins for spending hours on it as well, and I_may_be_dead for ultimately putting the final thing together and getting her up! Yay! Feel free to use this space to comment on how awesome it is. Because it is awesome. 

2. We have a [new Wiki page](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/wiki/index) that contains all the rules of the sub. If you haven't already

3. Here's something we'd like your thoughts on: Pose Request Day. For those unfamiliar with it, we have artists who want to request a particular pose or kind of model. For that reason, we started a weekly Pose Request thread once per week, in which artists could say what kinds of poses/models they wanted, and anyone could contribute said requests. We're pretty sure we're going to do away with this post, though. The mods keep forgetting to post it, for one (Like, when we do forget, the response is really underwhelming. We want to limit mod posts if we can so that it doesn't become too clutter-y around here. So, so let us know if you have any thoughts on this topic.

4. Stay tuned in the next week or so for a big announcement of some very exciting news! This statement is cryptic on purpose. :) We are in the brand-new stages of something awesome that will add a whole new layer to the sub. And that's all we have to say about that. For now.

As always, and we're happy to be here with you to make sure the quality stays high all 'round. I enjoy ""seeing"" so many of you regulars every day - what a wonderful community.

Thanks everyone!

Until next time

One of the things (we think) that makes our sub stand out (you know

Several tips from our subscribers given in our past monthly State of the Union posts have been used to tweak and improve the sub. For instance, which was a user tip. We've completely redone our sidebar, have started featuring an artist in-depth once per week, we now remove filler comments, and we have a pose/model request thread once per week. All of these were due to the feedback we received. So, we do take it seriously.

Not everything about the sub is up for potential change at this moment

1. Tracing. Tracing is a serious bone of contention in this sub again and again, but please feel free to present them below. **Edit: Based on the discussion allow, tracing will continue to be allowed.**

2. How does everyone feel about the weekly mod posts? We've recently decided to discontinue Theme of the Week because 1) the mods kept forgetting to post it

Theme of the Week?

Pose Request Day?

Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts?

Model of the Month?

Also

Your feedback is helpful to us; if there is little interest in one or more of the mod posts

If there are any other burning issues or hot topics

In the middle of each month

We pride ourselves on being at least somewhat more democratic than many of the other subs. For instance, and now we have one! And it's awesome! Another example is our sidebar. One user said our sidebar was too crowded, so we created a wiki for the rules in order to keep the sidebar somewhat more minimalist.

Please note that while we may not implement the specific feedback or suggestion you make (we don't make every single change that's recommended to us)

The normal procedure is for us to present a short list of topics we'd like to discuss. Feedback on other topics is welcome

With that said

1. Would anyone miss the RES keyboard shortcut numbers if we removed them? This is a question from V108

2. We'd like to officially welcome yowtfyo and vatonescu108 as our two newest mods - they've been modding on a trial basis for the past month

3. How does everyone feel about /r/RGDGetsBought? It doesn't seem like it has much traffic these days. Are there types of pieces that you would like to buy that you're not seeing? 

4. Please keep an eye on the rules of the sub. We are in the process of discussing each rule in depth and revising them as needed. We continue to ask that parent comments be comprised of non-artistic comments only, you know, stuff like that. 

5. Artists should feel free to leave feedback (if they want to) regarding why they are not doing a post. This helps OP learn. :) Comments like this will not be deleted, feel free to say it's too blurry and dark, as long as it's said in a non-cruel way.

6. Reminder: Please don't comment on the appearance of submitters. If you wanna insult them or hit on them (or...both?)

7.Regarding discord with the mods, walking 'round the threads, encouraging good art and discouraging bad behavior. If a mod pisses you off in a thread (and I'm talking more to the general commenters and submitters right now, as artists and mods here generally do quite well), feel free to message the mods to discuss it. The way to do this is by scrolling over to the right where it says ""message the mods."" We will then discuss what rule or rules you broke and why those rules are in place. Please note that every single rule in this sub is in place for a reason, which means some situation or situations happened that made clear the necessity of the rule. So, if a mod gets onto you, it is merely to enforce the rules of the sub and to do our jobs.

Anything else on your mind? What do you love about the sub? What irks you? Speak now,False,self,t5_2tjl7,1371567088.0,,,t3_1gl4io

* ""I want to practice on the facial structure at angles.""

**Warning: This post is hella long and contains one ton of information**

For those of you not familiar with SOTU, we also pride ourselves on being somewhat more democratic than other subs, as we have been working with our regular and new users for the past year to make this sub into the great place that it is. This thread is a place for us to share subreddit news with you and to ask your opinions on potential upcoming changes.

In the past, our Graveyard thread, Artist's Lounge, our simplified sidebar, and our removal of non-art-related comments. However, please note that we can't and won't take every single suggestion and make it happen, so please don't take it personally if your idea is vetoed.

This thread is not a place to bash the mods. So

With that said

The first bit to talk about is all of the crazy growth we've experienced this month. /u/Tru_Fakt, which resulted in us going from 14k subscribers to 18k subscribers in ONE DAY! Again, it took more than a year for us to reach 14k subscribers, and we got 4k subscribers in just one day. It was without a doubt one of the craziest, busiest days we've experienced in this sub. You can read more about that crazy day [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/redditgetsdrawn/comments/1jvqc4/modpost_attention_everyone_we_are_on_the_front/)

As a result of that post, we're averaging closer to 110 people in the sub at any given time. So, say hello to your neighbor, as s/he may be a new person.

The bad news is that this has resulted in a lot of extra work for the mods. Thank you to all the regulars (and to all the new folk with the inclination to read the rules) who have been monitoring threads for us and using that report button. We appreciate it!

The good news is that the influx has brought quite a lot of amazing new artists! Oooooh, and our regulars are continuing to improve and/or trying out new things as well - it's been like an eyegasm up in here lately!

So. That was the traffic talk. Thanks for listening.

We've had some staff changes in the Modhouse - vatonescu108 helped us out for a while and created some AWESOME scripts that make our lives easier. She's no longer acting as a mod

We did add, so right now it's essentially removing all non-imgur posts for us, which is fabulous and takes some of the workload off of our shoulders. We plan on programming (?) it to do more things in the future.

We've had many suggestions that we should take after /r/photoshopbattles' format. For those of you who are unfamiliar with it, because 1) we want the focus in this sub to be on the art (and we're actually feeling a bit more protective of the art now that the sub is growing and all the non-arty folk are coming in and making all their non-arty comments), and 2) we would still have a great deal of work to do, as the mods would still have to go through all those comments and delete the ones that break other rules, such as insulting submitters, creepin' on submitters, asking for or providing personal information about submitters, I'm kind of gently preemptively squashing that idea

But wait

First, ""Please draw us from our honeymoon to Hawaii,"" and things like that. GENERAL location information is now allowed, which makes submitters happier 'cause we're not taking down their posts, and makes us happier, 'cause we have one less thing to do. However, please don't say in your title or thread that you live at 4752 Coral Drive, not even first names. Any other personal information that you want to give, is done at your own risk. Remember this is the internet

Next! 

We used to prohibit watermarks as well, and 2) people were submitting photos with watermarks that were large, distracting, and/or that ran right across the center of the photo. Now that we're allowing location info, watermarks are also now allowed. If the watermark is distracting, we figure the artists will take care of that by ignoring the post.

We've also taken out two rules that were related to photo quality. We don't enforce photo quality, we don't want to remove all cropped-forehead submissions, for example, because some people out there can do great things with a cropped forehead (that means you, I_may_be_dead). We did add a section on photo quality to our FAQ's, though, to hopefully continue to encourage users to post interesting and clear photos.

Seventy-fourth reminder: **Tracing is allowed.** I can't even tell you how many times I've seen someone rudely announce that a submission was traced, yeah, duh, of course it's traced, it's not like I was trying to hide that it was traced,"" and then what follows is a debate over the merits of tracing as a learning tool. If you trace, you do that. It is not prohibited. It may save you some trouble to say along with your comment that it was traced, do not say rude things to someone who does. As a beginner myself, when I actually draw angles and shapes in the way they are supposed to be drawn. In addition, please.

The mods are getting tired of breaking up tracing dogfights in the threads. We are going to start removing people who cause those disturbances. It happens way too often.

Submissions Reminder: With the flood of new users, and then reposting, sometimes with an alt account. That makes us cranky because it adds a ton of work for us to constantly run v108's fabulous scripts and remove all the sneaky folk with their sneaky, jumping-the-queue submissions. So, reminders for the new people:

* You can only post once per every 72 hours. It will be okay. I recommend spending that 72 hours watching Breaking Bad on repeat

* Deleting old posts is not allowed. We often hear that artists started on something for someone who deleted his/her post. Don't do that! We ESPECIALLY don't like it when you delete an old post that an artist contributed to. 

* Reposting photos is not allowed. If a photo was ignored, read those rules!

Whew! This was a lot of information. It's been a busy month.

Don't forget that we still have /r/RGDGetsBought. We want to keep RGD as a free sub

Want to sell your art but haven't been selected as Artist of the Week yet? Well first of all, anyone can always post in /r/artstore. Third, I've noticed lots of people buying and selling art in /r/forhire. So, feel free to try those avenues as well.

In other news, who will find the good models themselves. :)

So...what's going on with you? :) Let us know what you love, if you don't have much to say, feel free to leave us a funny gif. We love funny gifs.

Thanks to the artists, and the commenters who give love to the artists. We love this community and it wouldn't be what it is without you.

Here's the skinny: Pose Request Day is a thread posted once weekly that allows artists to request the types of models and/or poses they want.

We (the mods) tried this intermittently for a while and didn't really get good results. So

Some want to see it continue, we'll be posting this thread to see what kind of response it gets. If you want Pose Request Day to continue, make sure to post a request (and then please follow through with your art), and/or check the requests to see if you have one or more photos you can contribute to existing requests. Please only post photos that pertain to the request (if someone asks for photos of headstands and you post a photo of yourself curled up in a ball with something like, ""Maybe this will work?,"" it will be removed.

So

Every Sunday: Artist of the Week (one artist whose work was exceptionally good over the past week is selected and featured). Posted by myself.

Every Monday: Graveyard O' Forgotten Posts (posts from the prior seven days that did not receive art are listed all in one place - like fish in a barrel!). Posted by ChillPenguins.

Every Wednesday (for the next lil' bit

At the beginning of each month: Model of the Month (one submitter whose photos were awesome is recognized and rewarded - the purpose is to encourage high-quality submissions in this sub). Posted by meeps114.

In the middle of each month: State of the Union (purpose is to discuss current and upcoming goings-on in the sub). Posted by myself.

Enough housekeeping - go go gadget requests!
