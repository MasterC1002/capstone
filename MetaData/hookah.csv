This place has a much friendlier vibe to it, doodles they made, funny hookah bar signs, and yeah, memes (though, those I can personally live without).

I will use the number of people who filled out the survey to see how many people are actually interested in it. In my last [thread](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/veavi/hey_rhookah_its_your_friendly_mod_jaxspider_with/) only 20 or so people replied. Out of 4000 if only 20 people want to do it

So please

Thanks once again.

Jax 


P.S.

Edit: okay so there's definitely some interest!!!! I have wednesday off of work so I'll make a video and post it!
Until then I'll tell you guys about my fixed burns.
So, you want to make sure the grain is running the same way or it will stick out. I'll go into this more in the video on wednesday.

Some of you mentioned linoleum there is no hope. I have renters insurance and I was suprisingly enough covered for the damages i had to my kitchen floor.

So the new place I'm in I got really lucky. We have a big old dump thing in our complex and i was walking by it and i saw carpet pad sticking out of it. I think to myself if there be carpet pad there must be carpet!!!!! I was correct. So

Additionally if you have carpet with really dense short hair you're gonna have a bad time. The fluffier the carpet the better.",self,t5_2qkma,1362961569.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/19yw2t/i_burn_carpets_a_lot_and_ive_gotten_really_good/

[This post](http://redd.it/1i3tkj) from /u/Vopogon is spot on. There have been posts coming up like this every couple months now and it seems a lot of the community agrees with them.

If the majority of the community feels like this is not a friendly environment it means one of two things to me:

* Either
* Or they are part of the problem.

We have banned a few people

We fix the problems by having good discussion drown out the circle-jerks and the rude responses. We fix them by down-voting comments that don't contribute and reporting comments that violate the rules...

What I am getting at here and what I have been saying in different ways for a while now: 

**We become more active

I don't care if you smoked your first hookah yesterday, or discussions. Do not let other members of the community deter you from participating, there are very very few absolutely wrong answers in hookah.

TLDR: Want a better community? Participate in it and treat each other the way you want to be treated and the few assholes will be buried by good discussion.",self,t5_2qkma,1373641506.0,meta,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/comments/1i5lue/an_edited_note_from_our_friend_arnold/

A few friends and I are starting our own hookah company. We have been long time smokers

We have developed a few prototypes

As graduating college students, and dissatisfaction.

We understand that this won't be an easy undertaking as the market is saturated with KM's, while we love the handmade quality of many of our Hookahs, a lot of them have been going down hill very fast from bad welds, leaks, things suck in our stems, poor purge valves, and etc. We just don't understand why its so hard to make a quality Hookah at a great cost anymore.

Our current concept and the prototypes we have been working on are based on this: CNC precision machine top and bottom sections of the stem, while providing a great value to our customers we would need to manufacture 1,000 stems for the initial run.

Our main questions follow: How often do you guys purchase hookahs, quality, etc. We greatly appreciate your opinion on this! Thanks.

EDIT: Thank you everyone for your input! I have not replied to everyone, I'll be sure to add pictures of our prototypes (maybe a video?), right now they're rough but our latest design is going on the machine by next week! I will personally keep you guys updated as we hit bigger milestones.

1375831065.0,1juggr,Beginners guide to E-Cigs/E-Hookah,Medicwine,81,19,33,"I've noticed that not many people in /r/hookah know much about electronic cigarettes. I thought I'd write up a big thread comparing the two. I'd just like to start this off by saying if you're interested in using/buying ecigs you should definitely head over to /r/electronic_cigarette for more information. 

Here's what I hear being asked most: How does the vapor compare to hookah smoke in terms of flavor and quantity?

Well to start off

Vapor production depends on your device. Right now I'm using a k100 mech mod

Well what about taste? Hookah produces a more earthy/tobacco flavor. If you get some lemon-lime shisha it still has that shisha taste. E-cigs are *straight* flavor. Some devices produce clearer flavors than others, but keep in mind that even those are going to taste more like a tobacco pipe than a hookah. 

[edit] I'd like to add in here that ecig vapor has something that hookah smokers arent going to be familiar with. Throat hit. Good throat hit is something ecig users strive to achieve. You know that back of the throat feeling when you leave a coal in the same spot too long and it burns? Its essentially that, ecigs have a heavier hit and take getting used to. 0% nicotine juices dont have that, but I'll get into that later when I recommend devices. 

**Getting into E-Cigs/E-hookah** 

For the sake of explanation I'm going to assume that you, but thats not what I'm using this section of the thread to teach you to do. If this has sparked your interest, feel free to start a thread in /r/electronic_cigarette and ask questions there. 

Here's my recommended setup for those interested in using ecigs as hookahs. Keep in mind that you should absolutely shop around. Usually vendors are not associated with manufacturers. You can get deals on equipment by simply finding a site with a lower price on the same model. I buy all my equipment from [VaporBeast](www.vaporbeast.com) but feel free to just google the device name and shop around. 

Newb/Low-Level:

[Ego Battery](http://www.vaporbeast.com/eGo-Battery-900-mAh-p/32-0061-001.htm) - Small, inexpensive

[Evod](http://www.myvaporstore.com/Kanger_EVOD_eGO_Bottom_Coil_Clearomizer_p/krev.htm) - fits ego nicely

Medium Setup (I've used ecigs/ehookah before and I like it but I want something better than most) 

[iTaste MVP](http://www.vaporbeast.com/Innokin-iTaste-MVP-p/36-0090-000.htm) - Variable Voltage, sturdy and reliable, really good battery life, usb port can be used to charge phones/ipods

[Boge Cartomizers](http://www.vaporbeast.com/Boge-Cartomizer-Low-Resistance-2-0-ohm-Stainless-p/62-0123-054.htm), put something that holds liquid on the outside of the tank, and you wont have to fill/replace your cartomizer. 


**Juice**

So if you smoke hookah but dont ever smoke cigarettes, but have your roots in hookah, get most of your juice in 0nic and get at least one bottle of 6mg or whatever the lowest above 0 the site has. Just keep in mind throat hit can be harsh if you directly inhale the vapor the way you do with hookah. Hookah goes in this and comes out thick, but vapor goes in thick as well. I recommend mouth inhaling and then inhaling the vapor from your mouth. If that ^makes ^any ^^sense

Buy all your juice from www.mtbakervapor.com. Trust me. They have excellent customer support

But what to buy? Well first off you might be tempted to buy a bunch of fruit flavors or sweet flavors. Imagine the only liquid you were allowed to drink for a month was kool-aid. It might be some [awesome kool-aid](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/ecto-cooler-e-juice-baker-vapor/) but you're going to burn yourself out when want something like a soda or a coffee. My all time favorite flavor is the Mtn Dew flavor from MBV (just checked

Grab some fruit flavors in your favorite fruit, but vaping mint flavors was like chewing gum. Just flavor, no gross tobacco. Thats NOT what tobacco flavors in ecigs are like. A cheap tobacco flavor I tried changed the way I vape forever and got me hooked. I didnt realize it would be so delicious. Its hard to describe until you've tried it, but its almost like coke as compared to orange soda. [555](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/555-e-juice-baker-vapor/), [RY4](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/ry4-e-juice-baker-vapor/), or standard [Tobacco](http://www.mtbakervapor.com/nicotine-juice/american-tobacco-e-juice-baker-vapor/) are all amazing flavors.

www.vapedudes.com is another great site

**Feel free to ask me any questions

If you're even the slightest bit interested

For that I recommend 4 things: (some of this might be obvious for most of you

1) By far the most important advice: Do NOT pack the bowl too tight, leave it fluffy and free.

2) Do not fill the bowl all the way to the top. Leave a thin layer so the foil (or the Lotus) does NOT come in direct contact with your shisha flavor. It can touch a bit

3) Don't KILL the hookah. Sometimes when I see a group of guys smoking a hookah, the shisha bowl will get WAY too hot (especially with 3 coals) and it will start to burn.

4) Blow into the hose every few minutes

I'm sure there are other things that I'm forgetting

I highly suggest not doing this. Soda pop and Tin cans are lined with a spray on plastic called BPA. This plastic will leach and is toxic when heat is applied. On energy drinks like Rockstar, especially Rockstar, you will notice a bronze or gold tinge to the can's insides, this is the spray on BPA plastic lining. 

Source about BPA: http://www.saferstates.com/2009/03/bpa-in-soda-cans.html

BPA wiki: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisphenol_A

So please for all that is holy

If you can not afford a typical windscreen simply use tin foil. [Something simple like this works wonders](http://i.imgur.com/al1c8h.jpg). I use 5 layers of tin foil and poke 5 holes in the top with a pencil for airflow. Feel free to experiment and fine tune to your liking. 

**I mean no ill will towards anyone about this

Smoking Hookah Tobacco itself isn't healthy and we don't want to add a toxic plastic to our chosen poison. 

**You could be saving someones life.**

Thank you also to BearsAreDangerous for really making me type this all up even though you inadvertently had no idea.

First, thought I could get off of reddit for a while I stepped down. The rest of the mods graciously let me return! Yay! So... er, Hi.

##Wiki now available!
Over my time as a mod here, or some information be added to the sidebar. While, I feel that has served us well, it can very quickly become cluttered with old threads and old information. On top of that the subscribers had to rely on the mods to get around to it. To remedy this we have started to set up [our very own wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/wiki/) and added a handful of active members as approved contributors. To begin, our goal is to move, update, and expand upon a lot of the sidebar information into the wiki. I started by moving our [vendors list](http://www.reddit.com/r/hookah/wiki/vendors/). 

Until we get a little more structure going we are going to stick with approved contributors only. As things progress we will loosen those restrictions and allow contributions based upon karma and account age. If you feel you would really like to contribute to the wiki at this time please message the mods.

###I want to add to this a little more and touch a little bit on /u/tangiers [post from last week](http://redd.it/1bxtoh).

With this wiki we mods expect that it will be used for factual information presentation. This will not be a place for brand opinions

Re: the wiki and the sub - **Hookah is an extremely subjective pastime and there are very few *wrong* ways to do it.** 

People will often ask questions that have been asked before. People will buy products you think are terrible, but at the end of the day, this is a community to share in the enjoyment of hookah and to lend a hand. This is not a place to treat people poorly because they are learning, or they have a preference that isn't the same as yours.

Thanks!

EDIT: I can't spell and need to move wiki/venders to wiki/vendors sorry!

A few months ago my friend was smoking hookah and for one reason or another the coal fell off and burnt a hole in their carpet straight through to the wood. It was pretty bad, cut out a little filler spot and just glued it into the burnt area.

The landlord was none the wiser and they kept their security deposit!

Just thought I'd share with you guys in case you're stressing about carpet holes and whatnot. Hope it helps!

I like what I'm seeing here and I hope to continue to see it. 

So far

* ~~12~~ 13! new hookah purchases (KM's, Regal, Mya!)
* Lots of shisha and coals! (Yay Tangiers!)
* New hoses
* Homemade hookahs (Tron and Pinnacle)

Regarding shisha, Fumari and Tangiers. You've helped with packing, coals, smoking, and overall had a generally good attitude about it. Keep it up!

2 other things!

To those who have just got their hookah, jojo9913, gnuworldorder and others. I would love to see your new hookahs in action!

I thought I'd risk it and give you all the update. It's been a long time coming (mostly because I've been busy) but here's the results:

1. On April 10 I ordered 2 KM Hookahs and 30 KM Hoses from their site. The hookahs were valued at $46.99 and $63.99
2. I received confirmation of the order on the same day, it was decided that Western Union would be the easiest form of payment.
3. A few minutes after agreeing to send payment via Western Union, so the shipping for my order would be $200. At this point I cancelled the order for the cheaper hookah, and said I would stick to the $46.99 hookah and the 30 hoses, with a total being $163.99.
4. I sent the payment on April 11. On April 12, April 16.
5. On April 18
6. Towards the end of May (exact date not available) I received a package in the mail from Egypt. It was the hookah, but can probably update later. Also, the hookah did not come with any grommets.

TL;DR: They did not ship the ""$0"" hoses, better off sticking to local vendors.",,False,self,t5_2qkma,False,,

[Order 1](http://i.imgur.com/PuiJhAN.jpg)

Now, they sent an email asking what the invoice number was. Nothing happened for 5-6 days so I made a new almost identical order.
[Order 2](http://i.imgur.com/gevbYjS.jpg)

I used my friends card to pay because he owed me some money. I figure okay all is well the shipment is on the way now.

But then
[Bank statement](http://i.imgur.com/H2gAVEP.jpg)

Okay this sort of mess up is understandable. They did go to that convention and maybe they were backed up enough to take almost 2 weeks to do a re-charge. I noticed on the website my order had been invoiced but not shipped. 

On 7/24/13
[Order 1 ""Refunded""](http://i.imgur.com/FsSvDyC.jpg)

[Call to 5star](http://i.imgur.com/mHW2w0w.jpg)

They asked me for my invoice number, alright.

It took one day to go from pending to nothing on my credit card statement.

Everything should be fine at this point. My second order is shipping

Unfortunately
[Returning shipment to sender????](http://i.imgur.com/EN8pORq.jpg)

They decided to stop the shipment on my second order

That second order had a different invoice number and was a slightly different order

I called them up again to ask why they stopped shipment on my second order and he talked about how my original order didn't go through (the one from 7/14) and then hung up immediately again. This guy does not like staying on the phone apparently.

What would your guys opinion be of a monthly fee subscription service that shipped you shisha/coals and trials once a month. The cost would be tiered starting at 20$ per month ~~up to maybe 100$ (given how much supply you want delivered)~~ *or two/three flexible payment options*.

Also, and more.

Would you be interested in it? If so

I'd also like to mention... if there was interest here. Although it is a small community subreddit, hand-in-hand with you guys and what you want.

So I work at a hookah bar and tonight this guy came in who was very insistent upon only smoking American shisha. So I went over a few flavors we had with him and he decided he wanted straight fantasia Cuban Mojito. So when I went inside (I was working out on our patio) to make his bowl I mentioned it to my coworkers. It turned out that this guy had sent back at least four different bowls the last time he was there because he didn't like fruity flavors and only smoked American made shisha, but he was thoroughly convinced of this and disgusted by anything un-American in the tobacco world. 

When I brought his bowl out to him he sent it back claiming that is ""wasn't fruity enough"". After we established that he didn't want fruit... Frustrated and angry that he wasted yet another good bowl made with expensive shisha we decided to say fuck it and made him a fruity bowl with our Al Fahker shisha. When I brought it out to him he liked it and kept smoking it. When he asked me what it was I made up a name... Starbuzz Lubricant, X on the Beach, 4play, etc).  

He thought it was great. So that's what we're going to make him again every time he comes in.

I'm a guy who liked to be 100% sure of something before making accusations. I came back home
I noticed a woman working, and she told me that she would call her husband. A few minutes later, she walks up to me with her phone in hand and asks me to talk to her husband. I explained my situation in a calmly manner, and when I mentioned that I conversed with Coco Nara and they identified that the product was a fake, he then became very hostile. He shouted things like:  
&gt;""How can they be fake when I buy directly from the company?""  
&gt; ""Please tell me how I have them if they haven't been around for three years?!""  
&gt;""There's fucking people like you who come in here thinking they know everything
&gt;""I sell this product at four other of my smoke shops and there's been nothing wrong with them.""  
&gt; ""Curse word, blah blah blah.""  
&gt;""I want you to take your money back
 
The entire time, and that they requested the name and location of his shop to do some investigating. I wasn't planning on snitching on his smoke shop until he decided to act hostile to me and ban me from his store. I honestly just wanted to return the new box (minus 3 coals) and get my money back.  
I handed the phone back to the woman
The store was located in a crap neighborhood, I probably won't ever buy from that store, and I'll do my best to tell my peers not to either.

""Not sure what you mean

 Of course I'm a vendor and I like hookah. I have been smoking hookah for many years before dreaming of getting into this business.
 I would bet that I smoke more hookah than anyone in the industry other than Eric of Tangiers.


 About vaping
 I have an assistant who, and when I take him to distributors he has been schooling them as well.
 With that said


 About the ehose, distribute, and run the business side of it? I think they are pricey, but for getting a comparable vape it's not much more, especially with it's output.


 Now I know they like to bash Starbuzz over at HP
 What? What they have heard from other members that post blindly? What they read regarding court cases? Those records aren't detailed. What rumors they heard about them and any law agencies? Seriously what do they know? Do these people know what it takes to create a business of such magnitude?


 I will tell you what I know about Starbuzz


 They came out with a new style of shisha when your only options were AF


 They came out with unique flavors and mixes that were never available before.


 They started to get copied left and right


 They continue to bring new flavors to the market all the time.


 They continue to bring new products to the market, only have been improved with better materials and specs like a wider downstem.
 This week they launched the Starbuzz E-hose


 They employ hundreds of US workers


 What have the other brands done for the hookah industry and the US economy?



 I had a conversation with Eric of Tangiers once about how impressed I was with his operation. In addition to putting out a fine product Eric pays rent to an American landlord, materials from American companies. It's amazing how much this one guy spends, not makes, in our economy.



 You should think the same about Starbuzz.


 Now about the e-hose, if not, no hard feelings. I won't have one in my hand where ever I go, but I will/do own one now. """,,False,self,False,t3_1k68bk
