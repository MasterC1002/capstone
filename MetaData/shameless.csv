How about some more lines from my man Liam.  He has been killing it over the past couple of weeks.  Great to see his character start to get more of a role in this show.  And Carl was also fantastic in this episode in dealing with Liam as well in trying to get his new parents to avoid adopting them.

On to the meats and potatoes for this episode and I was hoping for a little more with the way it was all set up.  I thought it was a great opportunity to add some more drama with all of the kids being sent into different homes and being split up even if a few of them were still paired together.

1365366935.0,1bvegd,(Spoilers) Figuring out the meaning of the episode titles.,,21,5,10,"Hey guys. You may or may not remember, so here goes! Also

Let's get started.

**S01E01 - Pilot**: The traditional name of a first episode of any new TV show. 

**S01E02 - Frank The Plank**: This was the episode where Frank woke up in Canada after Jimmy dropped him off there. I believe they referred to him as ""Frank The Plank"". If not

**S01E03 - Aunt Ginger**: Self explanatory. This was the episode where Fiona found out about Frank burying Aunt Ginger

**S01E04 - Casey Casden**: I don't remember. That one's up to you guys.

**S01E05 - Three Boys**: Doctors were concerned about a lump on Frank's scrotum

**S01E06 - Killer Carl**: The school Carl goes to (went to?) demanded to see his parents

**S01E07 - Frank Gallagher: Loving Husband

**S01E08 - It's Time to Kill the Turtle**: This one's up to you guys.

**S01E09 - But At Last Came a Knock**: Maybe something to do with Monica turning up? That's about all I got. 

**S01E10 - Nana Gallagher Had an Affair**: This was the episode where they found out that Ian wasn't Frank's son. Frank said something along the lines of ""Nana Gallagher Had an Affair""

**S01E11 - Daddyz Girl**: I'm pretty sure that rings a bell when you read it. If not

**S01E12 - Father Frank

**S02E01 - Summertime**: I think it's pretty self explanatory. It's summer, blah. 

**S02E02 - Summer Loving**: I don't know

**S02E03 - I'll Light a Candle for You Every Day**: Frank wanted to get some woman's (they called her butter face) pension

**S02E04 - A Beautiful Mess**: Probably something about how that woman found out that Fiona fucked Craig Heisner (sp?), and Lip tried to find out Jody's dirty secrets. 

**S02E05 - Father's Day**: Something about Lip being the father of Karen's baby

**S02E06 - Can I Have a Mother**: Frank's mother was released from prison

**S02E07 - A Bottle of Jean Nate**: No idea.

**S02E08 - Parenthood**: No idea. 

**S02E09 - Hurricane Monica**: This was the episode where Monica came back into town to fuck shit up.

**S02E10 - A Great Cause**: I don't know.

**S02E11 - Just Like the Pilgrims Intended**: This was the episode where they celebrated Thanksgiving...and their Thanksgiving took a turn for the worst. Their mother, who clearly wasn't Lip's, and had Down Syndrome. 

**S02E12 - Fiona Interrupted**: This one has haunted me for a while. I have never been able to figure out exactly what it means. I just remember Lip moving back home, and Frank and Debbie breaking Monica out of the hospital.

**S03E01 - El Gran Canon**: Frank's new nickname. 

**S03E02 - The American Dream**: Fiona tried to live The American Dream by throwing a club party, and always will be poor. 

**S03E03 - May I Trim Your Hedges?**: Lip offered to trim some woman's hedges (her name eludes me atm), as she claimed. 

**S03E04 - The Helpful Gallaghers**: Lip saving Mandy's brother

**S03E05 - The Sins of My Caretaker**: In this episode, believing that she couldn't tell anyone anything about it, however, she discovered that the nun was writing a blog called ""The Sins of My Caretaker"", in which she gave a detailed account of everything Sheila had said to her.

**S03E06 - Cascading Failures**: Things took a turn for the worst in this episode. Fiona found out that Frank called CPS

**S03E07 - A Long Way From Home**: No idea. 

**S03E08 - Where There's a Will**: The Gallaghers battled their cousin

**S03E09 - Frank the Plumber**: Earlier on in the season

**S03E10 - Civil Wrongs**: A play on ""Civil Rights"". Frank became the face of the Gay Rights Movement

**S03E11 - Order Room Service**: Frank and Carl bonded. Frank explained that when he was a kid, they went to a hotel, ordered room service, and watched porn on the television. Frank got caught, and told Carl to celebrate, by telling him to 'order room service.'

**S03E12 - Survival of the Fittest**: Possibly something about how Frank is in the hospital

Well, fill in the blanks. Or correct the ones you believe are wrong.

I have to say it was great, Fiona was totally lovable (as she should be), the brothers played off each other perfectly, it was really nicely done. 

The last episode was ""Holy Shit"" all over the place. Call me crazy but I've never seen a show take things that far. The ""ice fishing trip"" was heart wrenching. Hell the guy seeing the entire office watching the video hurt a lot too. To think it all started with an apple falling on the floor. 

The sex scene itself was, I loved it. I like most things about the show. 

It would be fun to psycho-analyze all the characters. 

So as for the UK show, events...

I'm only 10 minutes in, or will I find it ""toned down"" from the Showtime version? 

I'll give the show a few episodes

Also, season 2 has 10 plus a Christmas special. Unless they consolidated the 17 episodes down to 12, but I can't see that. 

Also why the hell doesn't this board have more people? ",self,t5_2sctv,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/shameless/comments/o2igr/how_closely_does_shameless_usa_mirror_shameless/

Obviously, I'm wondering if there's going to be some sort of subtle reference to the Game of Thrones series in each episode of season 2. Eunuchs feature prominently throughout the series. One of the main characters is a eunuch.
