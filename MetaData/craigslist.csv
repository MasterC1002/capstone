Ok. Let's be honest. I came into the restroom, and could probably accommodate Huckleberry Finn, Jim, and several steamboats. I get it. Congratulations.

I entered the restroom, nay, dripped, into the urinal. You know it. I know it. I was finished long before your manly stream was done, and you cast a sympathetic look my way. Possibly, you were worried that my prostate was enlarged by cancer or some other disease, and that it couldn't adequately squeeze my bladder. You probably pictured my dong as being a feeble man-gina

Well listen to me you self-satisfied prick. I can piss with the best of them. I can let loose a flood of a magnitude that might require God to come down from on high and warn some motherfucker to build a boat and grab some fucking animals. Forty days, even though I didn't REALLY need to go. I didn't count on Mr. Firehose Dong being right next to me. I didn't expect that someone with a urethra the size of my thumb would be punishing the porcelain one urinal over. So don't feel like you're superior to me, man. In fact, count this as an invitation. Meet me in the restroom on the west side of the building At 1:30 pm on Monday and I will UNLEASH HELL on the urinal. I will expel a stream of urine that will cause barn animals in the next county to flip out. Bring me a terrorist and I will water board that motherfucker with my pee. You will see rainbows in the geyser that flows from my pee hole. Let's do this. ",,False,,False,t3_90nl1

It's a Friday, *Craigslist*. Now, you just can't wait to be able to share a genuine LOL with the Reddit community, so you, in the midst of soaring workplace productivity, click the link.

Then it happens. You see the following text on your screen:

Your head falls to your cluttered desk

**Mystery Box - $40**

Alright jerks, a model kit, some CDs, movies and computer games, some other stuff? That sounds like a reasonable guess. Little shredded up bits of paper supporting an assortment of tin cans missing their labels? YOU DON'T KNOW, STOP GUESSING. WHY WOULD I CALL IT A ""MYSTERY BOX"" IF I TOLD YOU WHAT'S INSIDE, IDIOT?

That said, because there's NOTHING to see here. Let your disgusting imaginations and filthy money run wild somewhere else on this god-forsaken website. Next, I'm sure most of you are saying ""why is this gai askin for 40 bux for a box of stuff??? is this guy retarded?? lol"" I WAS JUST ABOUT TO TELL YOU WHY IT'S FORTY DOLLARS, RETARD. For one, you're not just getting a pile of crap in a green Loblaws bag. You're getting ALL of the following:

- Over $100 worth of things that I'M STILL NOT GOING TO TELL YOU ABOUT
- An authentic corrugated cardboard box
- One poem about a topic of the buyer's choice. It will be written in doggerel verse or iambic pentameter
- Decorations on the box made to your specifications
- A list of the best restaurants in downtown Toronto. Only applies to people who don't have a palate that's crap
- Similar fun as that one website
- If you hate everything in the box
- The breathtaking rush of a risky investment
- An epic tale of a wonderful box to tell your grandchildren about

Better send me an email fast about your interest in this amazing offer, but consider this: has your life gotten so grim that you want to negotiate with a heavily-medicated lunatic about a box that might contain 5000 origami cranes made out of old Polish newspapers? That's what I thought.

For all of you intelligent enough to see a once-in-a-lifetime offer such as this, then weep bitter tears of disappointment because you will never be the proud owner of this box. If you're afraid that you'll have to interact with a man whom aliens instructed to sell his most valuable possessions to keep the spiders from overrunning the earth; I promise that I will be mostly clothed and won't discreetly spit out the olanzapine when the orderly isn't looking on the day I meet you. I mean, I'll try not to spit it out, but I'm only human.

Hope to hear from you soon! :)

I haven't given a single person my PayPal email.. which begs the question: how exactly would I be in danger or scammed if all I gave these people was that email?  There's technically little chance they can hack in or care enough to brute force my account.

I run a DJ company in Harrisburg

Fast forward to December 2010

1. Tried posting Text only ads with no graphics
2. Created new account with new email
3. Posting at a different IP with same account (diff. location). Flagged

4. The ultimate attempt to get past this... (actually did this twice) NEW account, text and graphics, different image hosts and everything.  This attempt would have made me look like a completely different person to the system and they STILL GOT FLAGGED.  With different everything, including ad and title.

At this point I have no idea what to do.  If the ad still gets taken down when im a complete different person to the system and the ad is completely different with different wording and everything i have no idea what to do.  If anyone could shed some light on this that would be great

Ive used my girlfriends phone number, dads phone, brothers phone, friends phone, and grandmas phone.  So any foolproof thing would be great im running out of phones haha.

edit: this is being posted in harrisburg
Also my ads are being removed from different areas other than harrisburg, state college, york, and lancaster.  I am currently testing an ad in Iowa for shits to see if that gets removed also. Trying to narrow down what could be causing it.  The Iowa ad is very basic text only from the account that is completely fresh in every way.

Moving on, I was stupid to not check on the spot and open it there at the meet. I go home and open it, surprise! Killzone 2 disc inside. The box was shrink wrapped (not hard to imagine he had access to a shrink wrap machine at work or something), and the cover and even the manual was Heavy Rain. Only the disc was Killzone 2. I've texted back to the guy but no reply (didn't hurt to try). I want to believe this was an honest mistake. I can only see two circumstances for this case: he either accidentally put the wrong disc in before he wrapped it or someone else did and he got it from them. Either way, he lied about it being new. Upon closer inspection, the disc is in fine condition but the box does have very small dents in a couple places. My best bet now is to just sell it (I see other posts for about $10-15).

I am looking for a room in an apartment. I thought I found a nice place. I met the ""landlord"" who lives in house. His CL ad was detailed, Facebook, etc. Seems legit.

A few days later

**Red flag #1** He says ""Please submit a check for $1000 security deposit tomorrow morning."" 

Umm

I googled some more about Craigslist scams. Seems like a popular one is for scammers to ""lease"" an apartment that doesn't belong to them and one in which someone else occupies. Advice: ask to see the deed to the property and also look up records to see who's paying taxes on the property. Unfortunately

**Red flag #2** He responds ""Please come over tomorrow morning to read and sign the contract and to submit your check.""

I understand it's the weekend and he should have the right to show other prospective renters the place. But he's still trying to take my money immediately...

**Red flag #3** I called him back, said that *I* raised red flags for *him*, and said that it was completely unheard of to ask property owners for their deeds. He hung up.

Is this a scam?

Damn


edit
I conclude that this guy is indeed a scheming asshole.

I am seeking a new love.

It's spring

Once the thrill of falling in love hits your system look out! You're alive again. I want my soul to be infused with the bounces and bubbles that effervesce from the thrusting

I want a man who wants to get lost in the passionate chasm of love. A man who enjoys the slow, velvet grip of romantic obsession that makes you refuse to ever pull out of the embrace of new emotion.

A nice young man between 26 and 29. (I like em a little older;-). Please be sweet and lovable and smell awesome!
Race and height don't matter.

I am a woman ready for something new!
And let me tell you

I am over $24
.
I am disease and drug free. (Did have gonorrhea 3x but it is fully treatable and is ancient history) I have not touched Oxycotin in over 17 weeks and am glad that whole six year ordeal is over. I have sworn off of the meth and my word counts

Anorexia and bulimia have been on again

I have 4 children. Each is a beautiful treasure individual to his and herself. All of them have ADD

I love my six dogs and 3 cats, 2 canaries, 3 ferrets, 3 hamsters and 11 guinea pigs. Animals make life so much more full. But they got me evicted from my last apartment and newspaper training them is so much work. We are now living with a man named Mel who is challenged with mild Down's syndrome and H.I.V.

I have been unemployed for a few years now. Welfare only goes so far so money is tight. It is hard for me to find work because I threw out my back 2 years ago and have trouble with the physical constraints of working. I have been working towards my GED for a few years now and hope to have it by 2014. I was at a job in a warehouse for a toilet manufacturer when I slipped while carrying a returned urinal.

How are you doing today? Great I hope. I got the information and I am pleased to inform you that  it has been forwarded to my Associate to issue out payment to you immediately. You will be having an excess Check which will include the cost of the apartment for the First and Last month and my daughter's travel expenses ( Tickets and Bookings ) as well as other arrangements. As to make things easier for her in order to prevent further delay. Once you have the check you are expected to deposit it for clearance and it won't take more than 1-3 days I suppose before it clears into your account.Once it clears

Having a check issued out to you and another to my Travel Agent will demand two clarification from me by your Bank and the Bank of my Travel Agent and considering the fact that am being time conscious as my doughter have to be in the united state the soonest possible, please do not hesitate to ask.

Once we got him home and the vaccines wore off, he is the exact opposite. He is full of energy. OMFG, so much energy. And he is dumb. My god, this is the dumbest cat I have ever dealt with.

He's sweet - oh, he likes people - all kinds of people. He likes food. He likes playing. He loves paper bags, plastic bags, window sills, watching birds, sleeping in sinks, and generally annoying the living daylights out of everyone around him. Oh, it's his now. Did you take more than 2 seconds to open a can of cat food? Well

The only thing he DOESN'T like is the vacuum cleaner

He doesn't smell great. Sometimes he gets really excited and creates a smell that's a little like tuna fish. It's not pleasant.

What a catch, feel free to contact me. He comes with a litter box, a month's worth of wet food (you can try to feed him dry food, but you will regret it), a carrier, and grooming tools. He's housebroken and everything, but my god

I assembled what appears to be the decent offerings on craigslist for beginner bikes as of this moment in time. I'm hoping to find a riding buddy.

Anywho, that's titled, that I thought was a ""good deal"" for a beginner, leaving out immaculate but somewhat pricey ones, bikes that will tempt you to be stupid (which you won't survive if you're new on a bike, don't kid yourself) or bikes that are going to hit someone in the wallet hard if they drop it and have to sell it:

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2686915149.html

This isn't very old, as I learned on a very similar model, and if you're looking for a way to break into motorcycling, I recommend starting with a scooter like this one, so you learn to keep your eyes front, how to steer and turn with power, etc. I also have a tiny 50cc 2-stroke bike, and can be modified to do some fairly ridiculous things. Check youtube. I've seen these go 65+ mph. It's nuts. That's my top pick.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2708815412.html

CM400t's are entirely bulletproof, it's pretty low on power, and has been described by a lot of people I know as a great starter bike. This is my second pick.

http://philadelphia.craigslist.org/mcy/2709296158.html
This is another good priced, same power (ish), and has a lot going for it. It's a reasonable bargain.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2724789720.html

This is the kind of bike I ride (but not mine. Mine's red). It's a bit too powerful for a ""beginner

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2722784266.html

Yes, but it's about the only reputable sport bike on there for any price approaching $1,500 that I can find. It has been dropped, so be careful, check the turn signals/mirrors, make sure they match. If they do, it probably wasn't that bad.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2684568165.html

250's normally go for a lot of money, and the fuel economy is simply not great. It is the perfect size for a beginner, though, and it's a classic style, and the low mileage is great news for those afraid to get dirty with their new bike. Check the tires for dry rot, as when you're dealing with that low of miles, typically it's been dug out of a shed, with everything else being an afterthought. It has been dropped.

http://delaware.craigslist.org/mcy/2690775636.html

This is on the larger end of what I'd recommend

No EXTRAORDINARY pickings
