1343377131.0,x8m22,My Mostly Failed Mysterybox Experience,SenorCabby,51,8,36,"First and foremost


A few months ago I posted that I was looking to make my first trade. After quickly receiving a couple responses, I sent three boxes...and received one. For the one I received, I'm grateful and have since thanked the sender several times through the course of talking with her. One of the boxes came from overseas and got lost somewhere in customs, which is understandable and the sender has been in regular contact as we try to sort out its loss. The remaining box was never sent, and the sender was in regular contact with me until I confirmed the box was sent. Since then, I've never heard another word from her. 


This exchange was something that I looked forward to, I guess I got just that. But if people just wanted free shit, then they should just say they wanted free shit. Hell, I wouldn't mind sending some stuff. I feel cheated out of excitement and some other intangible emotion that comes with not knowing what to expect from a stranger. But in another way, this person proved exactly what to expect from an anonymous stranger. In this case, she stated she was a 20yr. old gamer girl from Indiana. 


Below is a list of the included items and the description included for the larger items.


-	1x Sim City 4
-	1x Seven DVD
-	1x Innova Sidewinder Distance Driver
-	1x The Art of Final Fantasy IX
-	1x Pride and Prejudice and Zombies
-	1x Pirate ducky rubber squeak toy
-	1x Bud Light table tent (picture frame)
-	1x No Hunting sign
-	1x Pewter dragon figurine
-	1x Tiny plastic trophy
-	1x Sharpie pen
-	1x Sharpie liquid pencil
-	2x Glow sticks


Sim City 4 - Enjoy! Hopefully you don’t have this already. I had an extra copy laying around. I believe it only has two discs.. If it ends up not being complete


Seven DVD - When I thought, enjoy. It’s creepy. If you have seen it, I’m impressed!


Sidewinder - This is one of my retired discs. I know it’s not in the best condition, especially if you’re just starting out. Take care of it, and don’t hit too many trees with it! 


Final Fantasy IX Book - This has been in my collection for years. I thought a gamer girl would appreciate it. I know it’s obviously out of date


Pewter Dragon Figurine - When I was younger, I found them and thought you would appreciate one as well.


There's no hard feelings here, but after zero communication after repeated attempts, and nearly two months of waiting, I feel it's a lost cause. 


To the newbies, don't get our hopes up in vain.

4. [**Here is the guide to successful trading.**](http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/p92if/guide_to_successful_trading/) If yooth follow that

5. Scams are in the deep minority, so you're trading at your own (albeit extremely low) risk. Keep an open heart and open eyes, and don't be afraid to ask for documentation that they actually sent something.

6. You do not have to use your real name if you don't want to. That's a concern for some and it's perfectly valid. Turn your username into a name or just add ""LLC"" after it and make it a business. This may not apply to all postal services and it may not apply if you use a credit card.

1328260436.0,p92if,Guide to successful trading,happybadger,41,5,22,"I need to put one of these up now that we're actually getting some user influx. 

**Making a post:**

- The most important thing to consider in your title is your location. Not only do shipping costs vary wildly between countries

- Context is another good thing to include. Things like your sex, these are all things which give an idea of what you're going to send. 

- Here is an example title and subtext from my perspective: [Title: 20/Male/France, poetry, and music geek, European cook, gamer, and bohemian. I'd prefer to trade with someone in Argentina or Uruguay!]

**Setting up the trade:**

- If someone messages you or comments, but use account activity and gut feeling as your guide rather than arbitrary numbers). You are trading at your own peril here, as the mods don't have the tools to help you if it goes south. Avoid trading with new accounts or very inactive accounts as a rule of thumb.

- Don't be pushy or overly specific. It's cool if there's something that you'd like to receive or that you can't receive (like if you're allergic to nuts, as there's likely between several hours and half a day between you and your exchangee, and some of us only visit at specific times. Be calm and courteous and your exchangee will hopefully be the same. 

- Don't demand real-world identities. Some of us are totally okay with linking our usernames to our real names, very obviously not my name (""Happy Badger"" in Romanian), and have never been returned to me or rejected by customs. Just write ""Reddit"" as their surname. 

- The logistics of this are a bit tricky

- **Make note of anything you cannot receive and why.** This cannot be stressed enough. If your immune system hates you or there are cultural, it's your responsibility to speak up for yourself. 

**Readying your package:**

- First, even if they've not mentioned it. Don't send pork to Muslims, even if it's a really good meat.

- Your exchangee may not share your sense of humour. I can't really enforce this, and if it's really bad I'll probably end up banning you from all of my exchange subreddits and passing your username and the thread off to all the other exchange subreddits.

- Make it personal. You're sending your life in a box in exchange for another person's life in their box. Where are you from? What do you do? What fascinates you? What kind of things do you find beautiful? Mix CDs of your favourite music, that one sweet or soda that you grew up craving, a recipe that your family swears by- these are things which turn a box of cheeky things into a box of sentimental things. Achieving a good balance between the two makes it all the better, as they now have something to play with and something to think about. 

- Please don't include illegal drugs. To save my own arse I have to ban any users which send illegal drugs. If you decide to ignore this warning

- Package everything securely. All couriers are bad. All couriers will beat your package like an Irishman's wife. Wrap things in a way that ensures they won't break. It's also a bad idea to include things which may break

- Fill out all customs forms as accurately as possible. This is very, and don't give them any reason to open your package. 

**Receiving your package:**

- Give it a few weeks, but do ask for a tracking number (NOTE: The receipt number sometimes functions as one. They will always receive a receipt when sending the package through a post office) once just so that you're aware of the status of the package. 

- It's a good idea to have your exchangee include a package note which tells the courier where to put your package

- Please make a picture post showing off your package's contents. This does two things. First, they're pretty much the entire reason I made the subreddit. **If you make a picture post, please censor the shipping label.** Any identifying information is fair game to anyone viewing the photo, and there are some sick people out there. Black out names, addresses, and tracking numbers. 

- Please message the mod(s) with a link to a picture post of your package by your exchangee. I'll(we'll) give you an AK-47 for that,False,,t5_2stth,True,,ak47,t3_p92if

So much cool (and Canadian) stuff - I hope my box doesn't disappoint!

The Walking Dead comic is awesome - I love the show and was not even aware there was a comic (I don't really know much about comics).

I assume ""How To Be Good"" is some sort of user guide to being Canadian (or maybe it's a novel - either way

Rum?  Seriously?  Rum?  Fan-freaking-tastic.

Some awesome buttons.  A few snacks.  One of my sons (a huge hockey fan) has claimed the flag and it's already hanging on his walls.  A kick-ass scifi post card.

The beach photo reminds me that I haven't been the beach lately and need to go.

The USB drive ... let me plug it in right now ... Um ... AWESOME!  Music galore.

Rum and music?  My night just got planned (and since my wife works tonight I don't need to share

1339104337.0,uqg86,I'm frustrated. D: ,SimplyDisastrous,28,3,11,"I have set up a mystery box with two other people and both have just dropped off the face of the planet. 

I got half way through setting up the box for the first girl and she stopped responding to my messages. So I didn't finish it and answered another girl's request to do a trade. 

We talked for awhile. I got the box finished and we agreed to send it out on the same day (so we could get them about the same time hopefully.) I go to message her to make sure the day we picked still worked ( I was on my way out the door to ship it and thought I should double check) and she's deleted her account. 

So that didn't go out. 


Now I have a box ready and nobody to ship to. So if you are a female (Sorry it's kinda geared towards girls) and want to SERIOUSLY trade. Please let me know. 

At this point I kinda prefer someone who has done this before. Just so stuff like this doesn't happen again. 

I'm willing to send you any kind of proof that you need to show that I have a box ready to go. 


I've really been looking forward to trading and I'm kinda bummed that my last two fell through like this. SO let me know. :D 


EDIT: UPDATE: 

I found someone guys. :D Thank you so much for all the offers. :) It means a lot to me that so many of you were  willing to help me out. :)

I can't wait to read the books, eat the candy, take a bath, and show off the rest of my haul! (and right now, my cat is trying to eat the tissue paper, so you even made him happy. seriously, he's going crazy right now)

Here's a quick run-down of the contents:

2 books (The Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan and In a Sunburned Country by Bill Bryson)

2 cds (one by Hawksley Workman - and the inspiration for TheDeliciousWolves' username

tea! I can't wait to try this - and it gave the entire box and delicious smell

Candy Cane bath salts

A recipe for carrot cake - I have to be honest, so I'm totally going to make this for him for his next birthday!

Field Notes memo book

Godiva chocolate candy and a caramel apple pop (!!)

4 totally fun stickers (including R2D2 :)

A flower for Rememberance Day (Nov. 11 in Canada)

The blowout card - ah

And a What Would Honey Badger do pencil!

I'm currently an English teacher in Japan. On monday nights I run an english conversation class. 
I just recently learned about mystery box and told my class about it. I also asked if they'd like to try it as a group. 

So here's what would happen. 
They gather a few items and put it in a box for you. You send me a box back and we open it together. 

The group consist of 7 adult students. They would all pitch in one or two things. So you wouldn't feel like you have to cram a box for a whole class. Just a few magical things. 

Mind you

Anyone up for it? PM me. ",,t5_2stth,False,,ak47,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/mysterybox/comments/txfa3/mystery_box_from_japanspecial/

1339380703.0,uvhc8,Desolator001 deserves more than an AK - a HUGE internet hug!,foolish_enthusiasm,23,2,11,"I am absolutely in love with everything that this amazing Redditor decided to send me!

I opened the Ron Paul sticker-ed box to find a cryptic message that said ""The flashdrive explains everything!"" and proceeded to find my favorite item in the box - a [teddy bear](http://i.imgur.com/L7CwY.jpg) from his highschool with his mascot and colors

I watched the flashdrive and at first the only thing I could find on it was a video of him bathing a cat. That didn't explain anything to me and I sat there wondering what context I was missing...then I realized there was a text doc as well and *that* is what would offer the explanation!

Well the explanation and the contents of the box blew me away! Not only did he send me three awesome books (we both love to read and now I can learn a new language with my English/Spanish dictionary, but also a local magazine (the 4/20 edition :P) that despite living near the area, I hadn't heard of. 

I got a bunch of candies and gum! I was *just* saying that I really needed some Rolos before I got them in the mail!

He also included a Game Informer t-shirt that's super soft, a Magic card, some D&amp;D dice (I've played D&amp;D a couple of times and loved it!), some incense, &amp; what I thought was weed upon first glance, but actually turned out to be a locally grown herb that can flavor meats, or be used in teas. It also helps with lucid dreaming and relaxation. :)

I got a lighter and some matches

**AND** he included... A [GAMEBOY ADVANCE](http://i.imgur.com/jx1UT.jpg). With batteries &amp; with a game

This Redditor was excellent and truly deserves a second box from me. I swear - I want to put together something else for him. ...Maybe for Arbitrary day.... 

Either way - this is someone that needs his AK!

I'd like to point out that this is not meant to make anyone angry. Lets try to look at it from an adult perspective and if you are upset by it

I have some items from Victoria's Secret. They were for an ex

Important bits. The sizes are 36C and Medium. You must be able to wear these sizes! If you do not fit these sizes do not reply. 

None of it has been worn, lesson learned). So, I can't return it. Thus, a giveaway. 

I would like proof that you can wear it and those who send an image with my handle in it /u/gkss will get bonus points for proving you are who you say you are. I suspect this may be where some of the complaints begin, as I'm sure many of you can attest to. This is a very generous gift, we're talking triple digits worth of things. So, I'm serious about the ""it must fit you"" rule. 

PM me for details and I'll be happy to try to help. 

And, sorry to anyone offended by this. I'm trying to turn something not fun (a break up) into something fun (the giving of a gift or two). I hope you can respect that. 

Edit: I have 4 interested ladies. Only one has pics confirmed. Just a small update. Each has been incredibly nice. Despite the negativity in comments and in down votes. So

Edit2 - 06/08/2013 - I have my two recipients. I've let them both know, in a slightly different way :)

1340878996.0,vqgj6,LooneyLopez deserves his AK and here's why!,syxtfour,17,2,4,"http://i.imgur.com/cy5EQ.jpg

As you can see we have a wonderful assortment of items here

-an I &lt;3 New York t-shirt

-a very lovely NASA pin

-a wind-up toy robot (extra neat since I collect wind-up tin robots. This will fit in nicely!)

-a clone trooper toy

-a couple of JSA figures (complete with backdrop)

-some promo material for Marvel vs Capcom 3

-a green patch which is very mysterious as I have no idea what it's from or what it symbolizes

-a tiny skateboard

-a deck of cards (which shall be added to my collection)

-a classic balsa wood airplane kit

-my very own marching band gloves

-a Hollywood postcard with some kind words on them

-and some new reading material for the throne (handy


Now LooneyLopez, I received my box and was blown away. I realized instantly that I couldn't send you the piddly little box I had made, so this weekend I'm going to my storage locker and fishing out some neat stuff for you. I'll be mailing it out on Monday-ish and you should receive it by the end of next week.


Thank you very much, TAKE IT!",,False,,t5_2stth,False,,

A letter
Collared shirt (Microsoft logo
Electronic Musician (June
Kokomo sheet music - Straight from 1988
B-52s - Hot tracks! ""Roam"" is my jam.
""The 360 Leader"" book - My old job involved reading leadership books. This reminds me that I'm happier not reading leadership books.
Guitar picks - Personalized! Now I know that ForMoreBestPower ""came to play guitar and bang my mom!"".
Garbage Pail Kid card - I collected these
A mixed CD from a dubious source - I'll refrain from saying much (due to its source) so I'll just say that I listened, since that's a song I've been hearing all my life from cheery Celtic bar bands.

Much of this stuff will get passed along to friends and family that can make use of it; some of it will get absorbed into my stuff.

It is for the best if this time, unless happybadger concurs, this is how it will work: If you want to become a mod, you will copy/paste the below application in a comment and answer them honestly. I'll check your background, and there are the following requirements, again, unless happybadger concurs:

* Member for at least 3 months
* More than 10  posts between 11/20-12/20
* Not be an asshat

So here's the application:

**Why should I be a mod?**:

**Experience:**

**How does the AK system work here?**:

**Someone reports that they sent a box out and it arrived at the destination and the recipient hasn't sent anything out nor has he replied at all. What do you do?**:

[Unpacking the mystery box - a nice letter on top.](http://i.minus.com/iVVQC0bMZ6LZ0.jpg)

[The overview.](http://i.minus.com/itiivYwy0R0m.jpg) Sweets, books, DVDs, postcards, buttons, pictures, some jewelry and a 2$-bill from the US mint in pristine condition. Awesome. Even cat pics!

There's also some incense in there, though.

[Some more details](http://i.minus.com/it0Z4KA8zWZaI.jpg). Books and DVDs, and sweets. 

One of the highlights - my daughter with the [scarf](http://i.minus.com/iUFxtj22C89Ee.jpg) and the [bobble hat](http://i.minus.com/isi29OjPWFCZf.jpg). She likes both of them

[Sweets and buttons](http://i.minus.com/ibfNxah8beHpXT.jpg). The question for me is: Do men turn gay if they eat these things?
