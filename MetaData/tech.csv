Technologists would pirate MS products left-and-right, including Microsoft. Their business of repackaging the same Office suite year after year was lucrative, and their company yielded the richest CEO on the planet. Microsoft was happy, people who used their products personally were happy, businesses were happy. Everyone was happy.

Then came Windows 95. This was the first time Microsoft introduced *The Registry*, and required a DRM key to activate when it detected enough hardware had changed out from under the OS-layer. Technologists did their best to adapt, but it started going downhill right **there**.

Fast-forward to today. I'm wondering what I'm still doing supporting Microsoft software. When a hard drive starts to go, which nobody is making money through direct development and sales, able to do this simple, rudimentary task, and the most cutting-edge Windows technology has lost it? Why, after Google lit the path to righteousness by selling ads around their free (as it should be) software? Why is it seventeen years later, and I'm still hopeful that the ""Fix startup problems"" option on my Windows 7 disk will actually *fix startup problems* instead of wasting a half hour of my time?

My bedroom has blackout curtains to keep out the streetlights, so I turn that face down too (somehow this has silenced my alarm before, which sucks). Recently I got a portable AC unit specifically to stay cool while I sleep, and it has a blue backlit control screen. Even if I cover the screen with tape, the light seeps out through all the cracks in the case.  

Worst of all is my laptop. It has lights on the back to show that it has power. It has a little light on the front to show that it has wifi (this blinks constantly). So, the power cable lights up blue to show it's getting power! My ps3 and sound system have little red lights TO SHOW THAT THEY'RE OFF!

***
I have a laptop that was preinstalled with Windows 8. Once you learn the trackpad shortcuts and get used to the new start screen

#I've downloaded the Ubuntu version 13.04 64 bit disk image and burned it to a CD-R. From the disk I ran `wubi.exe` and selected the normal computer reboot option, after reboot, after I clicked Ubuntu at the OS selection (it did register this time) Windows Bootup Manager gave me an error saying that it couldn't load the OS because it was missing the file. The complete error message was as follows:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Starting Windows didn't succeed. The reason may be changing software.

    To solve this problem:
        1. Insert installation disc of Windows and reboot pc
        2. Choose language settings and click Next
        3. Use Repair

    If you don't own this disk contact with the administrator.

    File: \ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr
    State: 0xc000007b
    Information: Could not load application or Operating System because of the lack of the required file or errors in this file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
I tried again and it gave me the same error message. I figured it either downloaded or burned wrong

 Again

 Again

Again

Well, it could still be buggy and they may not have been able to fix it yet. I downloaded the Ubuntu version 12.04 64 bit disk image this time instead of version 13.04 and burned it to a different CD-R. With high hopes I ran `wubi.exe` and during boot up, the disk didn't run. No surprise there. You know the drill by now. Again, the same dreaded missing `\ubuntu\winboot\wubildr.mbr` error from Windows Bootup Manager. Sadly, the Ubuntu through-current-operating-system installer does not have support for Windows 8.

So by now I know that there's an issue, an issue far beyond the control of how many times I tried installing the Operating System. I had heard of a suspiciously unrealistic-sounding new feature to Windows 8. A new feature, supposedly implemented in 2012, called Secure Boot. Curious, I opened Windows Powershell and ran the boolean command `Confirm-SecureBootUEFI`. I was hoping for the familiar, bright red ""`The term 'Command-Term/' is not recognized as the name of a cmdlet, function, or operable program.`"" or at least `False` or `Cmdlet not supported on this platform`. The terminal processed the command successfully

^^ಠ_ಠ

^^^God.

^^^Damnit.

For those of you who don't know, you will most likely never be able to load up a new operating system the easy, normal way. For context, imagine that crazy ex girlfriend that you broke up with. Now imagine her with a knife, a lot of ropes and chains, padlocks, and a dark soundproofed basement. Now name her Windows 8, and imagine trying to break up with her for this hot

Yeah. The people who yell at sheeple for supporting Micro$oft

I'm pretty sure that Secure Boot is the issue I'm having when trying to partition my harddrive. I realize that I could always back up my files, but I don't want to completely lose Windows 8 until I'm familiar with Ubuntu and know that I want it.

So, attempts to help, or even just had the intention of helping.**",,False,self,t5_2qh48,,http://www.reddit.com/r/tech/comments/1hdxc0/question_trouble_installing_new_os_on_windows_8/

1370971217.0,1g4swv,An idea of how to defeat government surveillance once and for all,dingoperson,8,3,5,"Defeating government surveillance once and for all: An idea


**INTRODUCTION**

Here's my idea. Please note that I am not inherently opposed to the idea of government surveillance of any kind. Detecting people trying to blow up buildings is a good thing. 

Unfortunately it turns out that the people this tool was entrusted to just couldn't control themselves. They just had to push it, it has to go. 


**THE BASIC PREMISE OF MASS SURVEILLANCE**

Let's be a bit reductionist and imagine two avenues. 

One avenue is stock surveillance. You gather up a database of everything someone has done in their life. Then you correlate that information. If they reach a particular score

Another avenue is flow surveillance. You scan people's communications in real time to pick out key words. Certain phrases will flag you for suspicion. 

Regular efforts to obscure communication are self-defeating without a critical mass. If you are the only person encrypting your communications



**HOW TO STOP MASS SURVEILLANCE**

You work to reach a point where a lot of people have on their computer a utility that uses a small amount of bandwidth at all times to randomly send illicit and suspicious content to everyone else with that utility

For example: Bob wants to transmit a message to Adam: ""drugs are at my cabin"". Bob's utility will already randomly connect to people based on randomised user IDs transmitting messages about guns, celebrity names etc. But he specifically sets it to transmit this message to Adam based on Adam's specific user ID. Adam has set his to store any messages received from Bob specifically and discard any others. An external observer cannot know if the connection was made randomly or intentionally.

What about incidence analysis? If communications between Adam and Bob are far more regular than random chance? You just need to mimick regular communications with randomness. The utility might randomly attach to particular user IDs and transmit only to those for a while. For a period of time it may get fixated on certain terms (""undetectable knife"") and use those a lot. It may use a small bit of space to transfer entire documents. The goal is just to mimick intentional behavior as closely as possible by randomness.



**HOW TO REACH CRITICAL MASS**

Good question. Drive-by downloads? BitTorrent clients? Highly useful utilities developed by volunteers? Short-lived public attention? Who knows.

I swear that I don't do anything dangerous or stupid or whatever with any devices. I don't do anything wrong! That doesn't matter though

I had an iPod touch. Froze the first day I owned it and many times after. It wasn't just a bad one

Then I got a keybo phone

Then I got a blackberry 9860, and then after a couple of days of dealing with that, it suddenly got really hot. Too hot for me to hold. Then, when the battery finally died I plugged it in and charged it and it worked for an hour before it crashed and flashed the red LED, lit up the trackpad, and flashed an hourglass on the screen one at a time until the battery died again. I called help numbers, talked to my local electronics people, no one could figure out how it went from a functioning

I got a replacement phone, they told me that it must have been a surge of power that fried the battery when it was charging. Except how did I turn it on to begin with? The new battery works okay, the phone regularly freezes and I often find myself restarting it. I didn't have bbm for two weeks once, it just disappeared and came back. Other than that, I still use it.

At some point

I have an awesome laptop that has almost never failed me. Once the screen did stop working in spots but they slowly ""healed"" themselves. Occasionally the internet connection fails when everyone else in my house has no problems. 

Then 6ish months ago I saved up and purchased a samsung galaxy player 4.2 for myself. I love it. It has always worked perfectly

My family won't let me share their electronics because they don't want me to ruin them. Once, maybe 10 seconds when it froze. My friend thought it was hilarious. The phone started working again after my mom restarted it. 

My aunt doesn't use technology, otherwise she kills the watch. I've never worn a watch, but I'm thinking I would do the same. So, what ever this is seems genetic. 

But really, scientific explanation.",,False,self,t5_2qh48,False,,

Here's some background: 

At my place of employment there is a significant amount of down time and I often use that time to study for school. Those that directly supervise me have no problem with me using my laptop and plugging in my Sprint U600 USB card to access the internet for homework purposes. However

So my question, so it would only be an issue if it is indeed possible to record when the internet connection was in use.

""Apple was always an innovative company, but because they opened the platform and thousands of companies (both hardware and software) became interested in spreading the system. Apple Mac was keen on doing everything itself. The result was a good, but pricey system, that could only compete with the multitude of Windows apps in some areas. It became the product for a small, niche market.

iPhone and iPad is on the same way. They're innovative, and Apple bans everything that would risk its total control (see Adobe Flash, limited carrier and retail distribution, forcing of iTunes etc). The obvious enemy this time is Android, another open platform that mimics the innovative products of Apple, but with much more and cheaper (often free) content. People may want an iPhone, but will buy Android. Only time will tell, but when everyone will have a smartphone, until Jobs fights with the world instead of cooperating with it.""",t5_2qh48

1.  Be able to watch Netflix
2. Be able to watch flash videos in a browser where no HTML 5 alternative is available (e.g jwplayer
3. Work with my [wireless keyboard/mouse combi](http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/01/aplus/detail-page/B005DKZTMG_K400_FOB_US_lg.jpg)
4. Powerful enough for HD resolutions (preferably 1080p)
5. Be affordable (roughly £50/$80)

**Desirable requirements:**

1. Be able to play a local files from an external hard drive
2. Have a really nice unobtrusive interface
3. Be really small 
4. Be powered by USB
5. Work with VPN (really no biggie

See with my current set up I am plugging my gigantic laptop into my  TV which is a less than ideal solution, with the laptop being in the middle of the floor and the charger and HDMI cables running all over the place, I simply can't tolerate it much longer. Secondly, the laptop has a home, with a second monitor and speaker setup in another room, I would quite like it to live there and not have to worry about carrying it from room to room.

Unfortunately from what I already know and from what I have read about while looking for a solution it seems like there is no perfect solution. I have basically at this point only considered Raspberry Pi and Android sticks.

Raspberry Pi however doesn't seem to be a good solution for me because Linux vs. Netflix (although it is working on Ubuntu and other Debian babies, which for tin foil hat reasons I would rather avoid.

The Android stick seemed like a perfect solution, they seem to have a really inferior performance. Which I am absolutely gutted about.

Finally, I would be tied into a third device, which may not always be charged on in my front room, I don't really want that, but if I could watch all the things I want to watch on it I would still consider, however (I'm not certain on this one) I believe there is only a few apps that can run on it and a flash enabled web browser certainly isn't one of them.

The plan is to run RAID 5 over these, or if any other good rackmounted NAS-devices are available? Also, what filesystem would you recommend me to use in an environment mostly using Windows, but also with a couple of Linux servers a Linux-HTPC.

What is the cheapest way for me to get from VGA(F) output to HDMI(M) Input? 

If the above is too pricey would it be cheaper or even possible to get from VGA to RCA?

Provide links if you have any please.
