One idea I had was a weekly thread about which tracks had been released

For the time being I made 5 pages:

* **Artists**

* **Labels**, etc.) so I settled with their (or the artist it belongs to) youtube page.

* **Podcasts**

* **AMAs**

And here's where you come in

Edit: [direct link](http://www.reddit.com/r/hardstyle/wiki/index)

Edit 2: Of course if you have any questions/suggestions feel free to post them in the comments!

Edit 3: Since there are a lot more labels and artists than I imagined (what was I thinking), Scantraxx and Brennan Heart, Coone, DBSTF, Frontliner, Headhunterz, Noisecontrollers, Zatox on the labels and artists page respectively. So now you still have a list of all (all the ones we can think of atm at least) labels and artists but if you're new you can check out the arguably most popular labels and artists right off the bat.

A easy list of all new and old tracks of artists!

I want to hear more hardstyle in short amount of time.
No more searching if there are new tracks and if you missed a few.
Most tracks get released after one year they had been played



I could use some help in doing more artists. If **you want to help**

1372154427.0,1h12jd,The Hardstyle Vacation Review,squareuss,12,2,10,"So i thought you guys might enjoy gf and my hardstyle vacation review.

i made a view pictures and videos and would like to share it with you :)

so i´m currently upload my whole videos/pics (about 6 gigabyte) so i have a little timespace to write my story ;)

On 14th of June @ 22:00 we went by car from austria(linz) to the netherlands(amsterdam). 
After checking in

Hardshore was really awesome and the Therarecords-Stage was such a killer :) 

**Pics of Hardshore:**

[Part 3](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vCQ0SGJUKeM&amp;feature=youtu.be)

Hardshore was really awesome but we have been extremly tired of all the long way without sleep (friday 06:00-saturday 24:00 without sleep was very hard) so we had to leave a little earlier but we got a nice sunset on our way home to the hotel - [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/mnPkne3.jpg)

Then we spent Sunday to Friday in Amsterdam and enjoyed our freetime at the ocean - [Pic](http://i.imgur.com/MQogBku.jpg)

So there it was

Parking place and everything went very fine and good, finally.

For all who are interested in prices 1 Token = 2

Saturday was really really awesome....prefix &amp; density killed everything standing at blue stage such an awesome set :) As you all know adaro killed red stage

There was only one very big disappointment...on saturday we thought...""meh frontliner again? the same set will come up, qdance you bitches fucked me really up....hope they post a video of the sunday firework after gunz for hire because this was really awesome :)

Sunday was strange: rainy, stormy, sun, rainy....we put together our stuff and went to the car to bring the first things back (another night in the tent was unacceptable :D ) and after that we went to blue stage (like every day, best stage on defqon) eating some noodles, drinking a drink an watching hard driver like [THIS](http://i.imgur.com/j7OFkN3.jpg)

Then we enjoyed the rest of the day and after the gunz for hire set + fireworks we went back to the car and yesterday @ 14:00 we finally arrived back home such a good feeling in your own bed :)

i was just listening to a D-Block and S-Te-Fan thrillology mix and got lost in a euphoric reflection on my life. I got into it at first, the specific feeling of contentment i felt. It was (Im not alone by calvin harris and deadmau5) then i thought about how i used to watch defqon, edc, and other edm shows on youtube and dreamed of going to a festival. Over the years, I have been to PLENTY of shows. I thought about all the people ive met at shows, the spiritual connection between me and my best friends (and random people) during sets. anyways... there came a time when i was listening (eyes closed, HQ headphones

sidenote: i get alot of anxiety, im still outgoing person and always look for fun. but i feel a sense of being held back by stress. school, work, home life, etc. but ill analyze my stress and realize that its not a big load. but yeah, i feel like ive always been ""held back"" by an ""invisible wall"" if that makes sense.   

the reason why im posting this here, you got fired, you flunked out, you lost someone close, whatever it be... life has a lot of beauty out there. sometimes its hard to find the beauty, sometimes the bad out weighs the good. but does it really?
