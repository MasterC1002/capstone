LanHUB is a software suite I developed to make the hoster's life easier


Tournaments,  achievements, tallies and filesharing tools are just some of the features that help events of any size.  Text messaging, barcode, and paypal account support help larger events save time. I'm always open for more feedback, the point of LanHUB is to make YOUR life easier and have a fun-filled event!


So


LanHUB and tournamentHUB is already in use in 6 recurring events annually as a private testground


I'm already in talks with LanPartyEh

If you're planning to or have run an event

This may be downvoted to oblivion for advertising. Hefully not though

TLDR; Free Lan Party software to download when its released

**For more information**
Check out the [facebook group](http://www.facebook.com/pages/lanHUB/184330371033)

**Edit:** As requested, neither will ladder support or free for all matches. Those will be added after release. At this point I want to make the code as stable as possible. If time allows, i'll add them back on the checklist.

**Edit 2:** Here is a post outlining the new features as of May 2011. This might give you an idea of the UI until the webinar hits! [Baselan 21 LanHUB changes overview](http://allyourbaseonline.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=23720)

1356175354.0,159zgg,I made an intranet for our lanparty and I published the code on GitHub. Feedback would be awesome!,Risse,35,5,8,"&lt;https://github.com/Krisseck/Lanparty-Portal&gt;

So

Warning though

Much more documentation can be found at the GitHub-page

Demo site: &lt;http://demointra.urbanlan.fi&gt; username: admin

Why I built this in the first place? That is a great question. There is a couple of reasons.

I feel the current lanparty intranets are bit lacking. ALP-website doesn't seem to work at all. LanHUB looks alright

The main reason though why I built this though is tracking users at the lanparty. So, click ""Admin""-picture, click Seatmap) you can see everyone on the party. The search is also awesome. Just type the torrent-asshole's IP address there and it pulls up where he is sitting. Works other way too, if you need to find some guy on the party, type his username there and his seat lights up.

I am planning to have much more functionality on the website

Phew, anything, I would really appreciate it! We are having our own lanparty in one week, so I am expecting to find a TON of bugs then.

* Held at the Monroe County fairgrounds

* 24 hours long

* $20 entry fee

* Dinner and energy drinks provided for free

* Free-to-enter tournaments in the hottest games (keep an eye on our site for more information about which games will be chosen)

* Thousands of dollars in generously donated sponsored prizes

I have been organizing this for the last 5 years. At that span of time

Now Generation A was my ideal crowd. Everybody always had fun

Generation B was a mix of both. Some people go to brag hardware, when I say we play a bootlegged MW2, we do; when I say we play a bootlegged TF2, everybody does.

The previous 5 LAN Parties have been very hard for me - I swear. I keep a stiff upper lip whenever somebody says ""Good job organizing that LP, only 20 percent of the crowd joins and the game is short lived due to the small amount of players. Sometimes, nobody even joins!

When I look around and observe what people are doing, some are crazily leeching files, some are just talking and shit. This only infuriates me but I restrain my self from any sudden reactions.

The previous LP was the worst

To be honest, then it's time to do something.

I don't think I have the motivation to organize the next one.

* Have you ever experienced something at a LAN that other LANs should pick up on.
* What is one thing organizers definitely should not do.

* What would your ideal lanparty look like? (features, competitions, sales, prizes, sleeping accomodations, etc. anything provided by the organisation) (please try and stay a bit realistic, giving every participant a new gaming PC is not.)

I'm a PC gamer, HoN, Dota 2, etc.

* To people that have to work - I feel ya.  I work 40hours a week so I understand that.  It would definitely be on a Saturday/Sunday.
* Parking around me is free
* Royal Oak is awesome
* Additionally

If you REALLY think you could make it in the next week or two (next weekend

As I said

I'm thinking that this weekend (6/12/12) would be the best for the most people here.

So far I've seen a lot of interest for LoL and for some FPS.  Not much for D3 or SC2

You FPS'ers, whatever.  

Also

**Edit Thrice**

Dreamhack this weekend.  I'm not sure if that would make it the perfect weekend or the worst weekend for a lan.  On one hand

Ok everyone.  Here is what I think is going to happen:

A lot of people want to do this immediately

You will want to bring your console/PC/whatever and maybe some deodorant.  People start to smell after a 12 hour+ lanathon.  Snacks would also be good.  I'm going to buy a bunch

When you have a small LAN of friends (10-14 people) it's relatively easy to get people games and get them all playing the same game.  Once you cross the ""16 person"" line

In my mind this is caused by 2 factors
1) They don't want to play the game... but why are you even at a LAN party if you're not going to play the multiplayer games that everybody else is?
2) They don't have the game... I tend to stick to easy-to-install free multiplayer games in this case (Savage 2
3) They're shy and don't want to ask for help... and they don't know how to find the game on their own.

I am from Gator Gaming, we have an average of 700 people attend each one. I hear that there are sponsors that roam these boards so I thought I would ask here as well as through email and applications. If you aren't a sponsor then you can always attend for fun.

GatorLAN is huge LAN tournament event at the University of Florida. We at Gator Gaming are extremely passionate about eSports and host 2 GatorLAN's per semester with a minimum attendance of 700 per LAN. Our LAN in April 2012 had the biggest turnout ever with over 1000 people attending.  There will be tournaments in Starcraft 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops,  Super Street Fighter 4, Ultimate Marvel vs Capcom 3, Super Smash Brothers Brawl &amp; Melee, NFL Madden, FIFA, Tekken Tag Tournament 2

All tournaments are free to enter and prizes are given to top competitors. The tournaments will follow the most recent competitive rule sets from MLG and EVO tournaments. The event runs from 4PM to 12PM and all tournaments are ran on the day of the event. PC and FPS tournaments are bring your own equipment. We provide the equipment for fighter games.

We promote these events throughout the year in various ways. Our GatorGaming email list serve has over 1100 emails. We do tabling through the year

Sponsorship opportunities include but not limited to: Web banners, booth space and banners at event (banners are extremely helpful and effective as we put it at our registration desk so every person entering the LAN will see it), mailing list announcement (over 1100 people on mailing list), posters/signs throughout campus (over 50,000 students at University of Florida), and local newspaper coverage. We can also name our events the ""XXXXXXX Starcraft 2 tournament"" or ""Starcraft 2 by XXXXXXXXX"" if XXXXXXXX wishes to sponsor a particular tournament. We will be giving shoutouts to all of our sponsors throughout the LAN via loudspeaker, and during the award ceremonies we will announce prizes donated by sponsors and tell the attendees to check out the sponsors. There will be streaming for many of our tournaments and in the streams

The types of prizes we usually get from sponsors that we distribute to winners include: PC hardware, promotional items such as t-shirts, posters, and pens. 

I won't leave my name here but if you want to contact Gator Gaming for more information about the LAN check out our facebook page. And if you are a sponsor PM me on reddit and I will PM you back with the proper email.

First - Thank you for reading.

I figured this was the best sub to ask, but we've previously failed to deliver file sharing (and I really want to!). I will most likely be hosting more events in the near future, so I don't mind putting in some time to learn (except full time EE student). I have extra computers for testing/server, managed switches, ect. I don't mind testing a couple programs before the LAN, but I would really like some suggestions to go off. 

**TL:DR** **Need appropriate file sharing solutions**

~30 person LAN this weekend

-managed switches

-I can make them load software

-tournament features not necessary

-preferably free

-DHCP preferred

**EDIT**: I **really** appreciate the feedback from this everyone! The switches [cisco 3500/2900 bought used] are rather smart

For starters, still learning as I go. When I'm done with all of this, I promise I'll do my own tutorial for future people like me!

Since [I guess] I want ADC, StrongDC++ for clients and DSHub, ADCH++, ADCH++ GUI for hubs. 

D-Lan

FAP - for what it is

**FINAL EDIT** A big thanks to all!! I love the warm welcome and help I've received in the sub, though it's old). We were only getting around 10Mbs though, which isn't bad I just expected a little more (probably my cables :p ). I'll continue to test other solutions such as D-LAN and FAP, while I also got in touch with the LanHUB and look forward to testing that as well.

Guide-lines:

1.  Game must support (8) players either co-op or vs (co-op would be nice)
2.  Game can be through steam but can not cost more than $10
3.  Must hold the interest of 8 players for approx 10 hours.
4.  Must be playable through LAN or Internet with support of all players through just ONE IP!
5.  No turn-based
6.  Must run on 3 to 4 year old hardware!  Think core2duo ""era"" with probably circa 2008 vid cards that could definitely not run SC2

Preferences:

1.  Game that has character advancement/development.  I think this would keep our interest.  A game like Dung Defenders is a perfect concept for us but only 4 players so nixed for 8-player LAN.

2.  No FPS

No:

Demigod/LoL - been there

Minecraft - We are not ""creative"" people

Considering:

Torchlight II - if only six players show vs eight

Terraria??? - I haven't played this but it looks like it might be great character building

Serious Sam II - but only as a switch later in the night when we are too drunk to focus on an exploration type game

1358476263.0,16sjem,Has anybody ever tried to host a participation-based LAN tournament that spans the entire event?  ,TheSambassador,12,0,16,"I've hosted/organized LAN parties for years

The LANs that are the most fun, and it's this giant shared experience.  LANs that I go to which consist of 1 CSS server and 1 TF2 server up, then a bunch of random people playing WoW or LoL, just aren't very FUN, at least for me.

I, though I understand that some people love just LANing WoW or LoL all night.  Whenever I get those people into a new game though, they almost always enjoy it.  I haven't found anybody who has HATED Pirates, Vikings, and Knights.

I'm curious if other LAN organizers have tried to mitigate this

* Full game list posted before the event
* 1-2 ""official"" games going at once
* I keep track of, and maybe other stats (like overall time connected, their score, etc.)
* We have raffle prizes going that only the people in the current official servers can win.
* At the end

People still don't HAVE to play in the official servers if they hate a game

Starcraft II is taking a prominent role at this LAN party

Other tournaments on deck this semester include Team Fortress 2 (6v6), so there will be a more competitive atmosphere than at previous BSG LANs. The cost is $20 (pre-pay only), and dinner on Saturday and breakfast on Sunday are both included. We'd love to see you in Mount Pleasant for an awesome weekend of video gaming!

On the other hand I have the option of going for three d-link des-3526 and 3326's which are 24port 100mbit with gigabit uplinks. These are fully manageable with snmp.

Our university has good wifi coverage, so I'm hoping that router will hold up (lan only, no internet access with this setup).

For game distribution, so a question would be, would sharing the games folder on the network and letting everyone copy off of it be the fastest method, or just handing it around to people be best?

I'm just going to request people bring 2 litres/chips so we will have some snack food.  

Potentially we will have a laptop available for dedicated server hosting

But, and we're planning to be there the whole event. So one of our major concerns is money. We're only students, so we don't have unlimited money. How much money would be a good idea to bring along, wanting to buy food 3 times a day, sodas, coffee etc. And how much should we bring in reserve for, say, games or new peripherals? 

Next thing is security. We're two people bringing tower and 1 monitor each, and a tower without K-Slot, but with holes such as watercooling holes for running the wires through. 

Lastly, where can I put it? Or will it just have to live under my desk for the duration of the event?

The party itself will be held in a rented cottage 2hrs north of where we live. We are going to this place to Ski

There will be 8 people attending

So I ask of you:

* What can we do in the ways of TV / Monitors? I've looked at renting TV's for this purpose, which is definitely usable, but everyone else is a laptop user without such equipment. And as I mentioned, space is at a premium so bringing our own 42"" flat screens and lugging them up is not an attractive option.

* What are some games that we can play 8 player split-screen on a LAN? This group of friends regularly gets together to play 4-player local Halo, that's only one game. What about COD or Battlefield? Do any of them support such a set up? And is there ability to include bots in any of those games?

Looking forward to hearing any suggestions you may have.

Thanks

So I'm thinking of doing a LAN Party at my school and need help on figuring out how to set-up the network for it. I've started looking into switches since I would like everything to be hard-wired for one

I've done a fair amount of research and learned that layer 2 switches are not capable of DHCP

So I guess what I'm asking is for the amount of people I'm hoping to have what type of switch would I need? Would a layer 2 switch work just fine? or would I need to connect my wireless router to it? Or would I need a managed switch?

Thanks for any input! ",self,t5_2rggr,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/lanparty/comments/144ybg/lan_network_help/

I have done lan parties in the past but this one has some special issues.
 
I just recently moved to this new house and it is out in the middle of nowhere. my only source of internet is wifi hotspot from my cellphone.

 I am planing on having 8 laptops 4 desktops and 4 ps3's the laptops don't have to have internet but it would be nice if they could so people could browse stuff

the desktops will be running steam games like killing floor. they don't need internet to connect to each other and play games but they do need it to connect to steam servers for achievements and such.

 so is there some way I can have a wireless router connect to my wifi hot spot to provide internet to the laptops and desktops? 

or is there some other way i can get this to happen? thanks for any help.

I'm in high school so times people can meet are horribly limited (I tried to do D&amp;D but no one could ever show up) and when I find a time everyone can go to I run into a these problems. A. People can't bring their computers. I don't know if there is any way I can have them convince their parents that they can bring their computer with them. I offer to provide monitors but that still doesn't cut it. The other problem is that they still want to come when they can't bring their computer (I don't know how that would work.)  B. Games. I try to make a balanced list of cheap games with a easy learning curve and not too violent. I even offer to help pay for games but that doesn't even help. Parents say they can't play the game or that they can't get any new games. C. Computer isn't good enough. I don't get this as they are already people who play pc games.

I work for a school within Birmingham as an ICT technician that will be setting up a stall for the forthcoming Christmas Fayre which will take place on the 7th of December 2012. Just as a course of gathering information and some insight I was wondering if anyone within the community has had successful experience in trying to obtain merchandise, LAN parties for social events.

A year ago when we first started this venture

The school has gone through a tremendous revolution and its setting up events like this that helps to strengthen the bond of student teacher relationships. As well as gathering support from the life blood of gaming industry that we all hold so dear to our heart.


We are using about 60 machines over two class rooms with the partition wall being removed  for a duration of three hours. There will be four projectors used showcasing the games so they can be viewed by visitors. As its a secondary school we cannot play anything above 16 age limit.

We have the following games available: Halo, Need for Speed Most Wanted and Fifa 12. Any help in sponsorship would be much appreciated.

Here is a picture of the smaller event that happened last year.

* 1800 5th July -&gt; 1800 9th July
* £50
* Good facilities
* 30/80 places filled so far
* I will be your bitch all weekend

After a lovely little LAN which was slightly cramped but very easy to get to in north Bristol

* Limited indoor sleeping
* On site bar (I'm assured prices shouldn't be too far from £2.50/pint)
* Nice on-site toilets
* Spacious seating for ~80 people
* Consoling specific area
* Plenty of parking

Aside from the obvious gaming which is most certainly going to happen, and I've decided that the best way to do that is to spend the weekend being everyone's bitch. Free hot drinks delivered to your seat? No problem! Cooked breakfast (subject to a few quid changing hands) to wake up to? No problem! My well practised voice is at your disposal if you need to find some people to play games with, and I can normally suggest a game or two if you're out of ideas and don't fancy whatever we've got scheduled. Anything else you can think of I'll at least consider doing.

We're aware of the venue being a little difficult to get to by public transport

* Create a Steam community group. All PC gamers should have Steam already even if you don't like to purchase games with it. Steam is a very useful social networking tool that you can also use to host events.

March 2nd - 4th: 200 Person LAN @ Atlas networks datacenter
[http://g.co/maps/crfvg](http://g.co/maps/crfvg)

**200 Person LAN:**

After selling out in /hours/ of my garage LANs I got to thinking... There hasn't been a large scale LAN in Seattle in a very long time. So me and a few LAN buddies got together and after countless hours of searching we finally found a venue in downtown Seattle and can make this happen!

**Cost is $45**
(We are running this at zero profit. Any excess $$ will be donated to charity. Likely Child's Play since we all have close ties to Penny Aracde)

Full 48 hours!
Start is 5pm on the 2nd
End is 5pm on the 4th

**JIMMY JOHNS sandwiches provided on Saturday! **

You get 32"" of table space and 3 amps of power. If you need more space or power than that then you are welcome to buy multiple seats.

A seating chart will likely come later

**WHAT TO BRING:**

Computer
Monitor
Keyboard
Mouse
Power strip (no daisy chaining power strips please)
Cables
Headphones (no speakers allowed)

You can also bring a cooler (as long as it fits within your space under the table) as long as there's no water ice.
Additionally you can bring your own chair if you want

**PARKING:**

We have 50 spots reserved in the Starbucks Center parking lot out front for attendees
(We tried to get more but they needed at least 60% left open for the business in the Starbucks center that are open on the weekend)

**NEARBY HOTEL:**

Need to sleep? Yeah... I know... Sleeping at a LAN... Lame... But some of us are getting old!

We might have an area set aside for some crash space. It wont be a separate area though so LAN noise will likely interfere.

But if you want to get a hotel there's a Silver Cloud Inn .8 miles north
[http://www.silvercloud.com/seattlestadium/](http://www.silvercloud.com/seattlestadium/)

**DIRECTIONS:**

Google map link to the Location:
http://g.co/maps/crfvg

To get to the actual LAN space is a little more complex.

Go all the way to the end of Lander St, You will eventually make it to a small parking area. That is the Load/Unload area. Entrance to the LAN is on the loading dock (you will see the gathering of geeks).",,False,self,t5_2rggr,False,,

* Can I play on the server computer?
* What kind of equipment do we need to network 5-6 people?
