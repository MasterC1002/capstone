**Do Not Consume Water Order for the water districts of Long Beach and Mill Neck Estates.**

-------------------------------

**Tips For Dealing With The Aftermath** via [r/Sandy](http://www.reddit.com/r/sandy/comments/12by8f/tips_for_the_upcoming_weeks_months_from_a_gulf/)

* **Contact your work ASAP** to find out when you will be next scheduled. After Isaac I was back at work within 2 days.

* **Traffic signals**: If there is no power to a traffic light
Home owners: Tarp your house ASAP

* **Documentation**: Take pictures of the damage immediately, misc. stuff that went under water. The more you can prove, the more you will get from your insurance.

* **Repairs**: Do not do any major repairs until after your claims adjuster has been there. Let them see the damage first hand.

* **Contractors**: Make sure any contractor you are going to use is licensced, they will be out in force. Do not pay the entire lump sum up front. Double check any work that they do, it is your house, make sure it is done properly. If you are unsure about anything, do not be afraid to speak up.

* **Self contracting**: Unless you know what you are doing, they may require you to do it before they release any more money. Protect yourself by getting somebody that knows what they are doing.

* **Gutting your house**: Doing it yourself is a good way to save money. It's cheap to get a sledge hammer and bust out sheet rock if your house flooded. It's also a great way to relieve stress! Just be careful not to knock down load bearing walls! Also if you are thinking about re-doing your floor plan and get enough money from the insurance, make sure that you have a dumpster though, you might get in trouble putting house debris like this in regular trash. If you do get a dumpster, watch it like a hawk, other people will try to use it to avoid paying for their own.

* **Electricity**: You might be out of power for a week or more. Please be patient.

* **Disaster food stamps**: Check your local media to see if there is a pre-""approval"" process that you can fill out to try to save a little time when they are released. Also if you do not meet the criteria

* **Debris**: Again

* **Fridges**: If you are without power for more then 24 hours, so I didn't bother to document it. Check your insurance papers to see if you need to document it.

* **Insurance paperwork**: Chances are good that you won't be doing anything tomorrow

* **Difference in damage**: Flooding is water that came from the ground up, but it was. Expect inconsistencies like that.

-------------------------------

Great information from [FLDJF713](http://www.reddit.com/user/FLDJF713)

* Below I've listed some tips and pleas I give that make all of 911-services easier for us to operate in.

* Cars in your driveway. If it's on the street

* If you are asked to leave, only police will remain in service in evac areas. Power will also go out most likely.

* Plenty of shelters out there for you

* If you are driving wherever, if we are responding to some kind of emergency, simply move to another lane and out of our way. Seems pretty like common sense.

* Generators go outside your house and as far away as possible.

* If power goes out, and you choose to stay, your house will not be attended to by the FD if a fire starts. Better not take that chance.

* Got gas? Store it outside and in the open. Don't let fumes build up.

* Charge all of your gadgets. Don't let the kids play Angry Birds.

-------------------------------

**Emergency Numbers:**

1351913334.0,12jsyl,IAMA Lineman for LiPA,LiPA_Lineman,47,12,46,"Hello

I'll start with an **overview of the system**

The powerplants generate 3 phases electric at 22000volts (22kv). It's just a way to get 3 times the power per rotation of the generator, that's why you'll see 3 wires running together at the top of the poles (but not touching each other or the neutral.  That's bad).  So, it's generated at 22kv and is then stepped up to 128kv or 69kv for transmission to the substations. There it's stepped down to distribution primary voltage (7620v or 2400v). These are the wires you see on most main roads on the top of the pole. This is what you tap into to power the transformers on the poles which in turn drop it down to two 120v legs. A transformer will feed about 10-20 houses.  So you might not see us, we might be 10 miles away, but we are working on the wire that feeds your home.  There could be several problems on the line that eventually leads to your weatherhead, you'll only see us when we're finishing up the last 5% of the repairs and finally restoring power.

**How we systematically restore the power:**

I've seen a lot of funny ideas about how we apparently triage customers and hook people up based on the customers need. Yeah, but they all have generators. We'll send out a serviceman to see if they can do anything to get them back on, but that's not what's tying up crews. Your restoration is not being delayed because of hospitals and other more important customers. They often comeback on first because they are closer to the feed. They're big customers and they usually take three phase transformer banks. They are just in line with what gets turned on first. We'd have to go out of our way to keep them off when restoring power to a town. They're just situated better; better engineering to minimize their outages.

So, we just pulled fuses at the main road to isolate those side streets (single phase lines) and kept moving on those main, three phase lines. That's why the number of outages drops so dramatically in the first few days, we simple cut off the problems that caused the circuit to lock out and turn everyone else back on.

Now, we prioritize these based on how long it will take and how many customers it will get back on. If there is a single phase line feeding 100 houses and all we have to do is cut down a tree and put a couple sections of wire back up, that's a no-brainer. We do that right away. Like-wise, if we need to replace a pole and transformer and run 2 sections of secondary (120 volt wires for the house) and we'll only pick up 3 or 4 customers, that is going to be the very last one we do. That is a job that will take 5 or 6 hours. We could turn on 500 customers in that same time.

**Etiquette:**

Ok, they'll turn 120v from a generator into 7620v on that down wire), the last thing we want to do is energize a primary wire hat some kid could touch. Unless you have a wire that is actively sparking or setting something on fire, don't tell us about it. Report it via the annoying automated phone service. If it's something that we can fix, we will, we will always look around before we energize the system. If you saw the problem, we saw it too and it will be addressed.

We are not a tree trim service. Never

**Never**

Don't ask for an estimate of when your power's coming back on. The answer every time in going to be, we might not have been there yet, or it might be a different circuit and we're not going there at all, another crew is working on it.

Please just try to be nice. We've been on mandatory 16-hour shifts since Sunday and it's not going to stop for a while. We literally have 8 hours to go home, and be back at work. We have linemen who have lost their homes and many who still don't have power or hot water themselves. We're fighting to get gas in those 8 hours too and I'm staying up tonight to do laundry so I can go another 7 days. Guys whose homes took damage are doing whatever repairs they can during their sleep time.  And a week into storm restoration is when we start getting threats and actual physical assaults and people blocking the road refusing to allow us to leave, etc.  So, we tend to get on edge after a bit.

That's about it. Hopefully this helped clear up some of the FAQs. If anyone has any questions

Edit:  Formatting.

Edit 2:  **Breaks:**

I didn't mean to make oir work day sound so dire.  Inba regular 8 hour shift we get a 15 minute break and a 30 minute meal.  After 10 hours we get an additional meal.  Different crews do it differently, head out and grab coffee/eggs on the way (that's the break).  We work for 5 or 6 hours and then take lunch.  We work until about 9, return to the yard, clean and stock the trucks and take our ""meal"" from 10-10:30.  I'm usually home by 10:40.  So, the day is busy and the work can be hard, but it's not too taxing or exhausting.  We just don't have time to do anything but work and sleep.",,self,,

We are supposed to be free from fear of illegal search and seizure without a warrant derived from probable cause. From DUI checkpoints, the 4th Amendment has been trampled time and time again. Well, the news about phone monitoring and PRISM is the anchor which broke the camel's back. 

Some of us are just plain old fed up and we are going to let our displeasures be known. Please join us as we try to educate, and exercise our right and obligation to peacefully protest an ever reaching government which is intent on maintining the status quo of control. 

Our first meeting is Weds night at 8 pm in Washington Sq Park, informing, dyving up tasks and more.  Please join us as we take our inalienable rights back.

Looking forward to meeting you.

Please be aware! Even though there will be alcohol there, we just need to make sure no one gets in trouble. 

**TL;DR:** Stop being lazy and read it

I am sorry for the wall of text though, so I'll get back to everyone ASAP. I'm looking forward to getting together with everyone~ 

**IMPORTANT!** Date is set. Anyone who is going to come, so if everyone brings at least one thing it won't be expensive at all, so I'd really like everyone to at least try to bring something to the meet-up. Thanks! 

Also, so maybe we could all bring our bathing suits or something. There's a lot to do~

**Update: Who?** I did a headcount. So far we'll have ~30 people coming to the meet-up. Just... Wow. I'm super excited! Also, but I'm clueless about the charcoal. 

**Update #2** It's tomorrow everyone! We're so close and everyone's been so cooperative. I mean... Look at the list

Also overrated is All American Burger. To me it tasted like big White Castle Burgers. Never been a big fan. I guess it's comparable for the price.

Underrated is Thom Thom in Wantagh. The steak I had there was really good and the spicy shrimp was amazing. Bit of a limited menu and a higher price point but the food was amazing. Never even HEARD of it prior to eating there.

Legally speaking, the whole story, right from the very beginning:

Oct 2011 – 
My birthday.  An old friend is in town and offers to buy me a beer for my 27th.  He had taken the train in

I get pulled over on Montauk Highway by a cop who claims I was “serving all over the road”.  He puts me through some field sobriety tests and then finally gives me a Breathalyzer.  

I blow a .04.  Less than half the legal limit.  Home free

Wrong.  The officer then begins to accuse me of smoking marijuana (I hadn’t).  He suddenly starts saying that he can smell it, but finds nothing.  But no big deal, he goes ahead and arrests me anyway.

At the police station, without a trial (yes, this is legal and par for the course apparently).  Thinking I have nothing to hide, as I had kept my drinking to a minimum and hadn’t done any other drugs, I let them take my blood.

I spend my birthday weekend in a jail cell and get arraigned on Monday morning.  I’m being charged with DUI.

Dec 2011 –
After many postponed court dates
The test also detected “Less than 1.0 mcg/L Tetrahydrocannabinol, and if there is any amount in there whatsoever, you are legally considered “under the influence”.

There’s also this little stipulation in the law that nobody seems to talk about:  apparently

Therefore

A long and costly legal battle ensued

September 2012 -
After many months of court dates and costly, or Driving while Ability Impaired, a traffic violation that is considered MUCH less severe than a DUI conviction.  Phew!

So it seemed I had gotten lucky (finally).  I was sentenced to a $800 fine and a 90-day suspension of my license.

It was finally over... at least that’s what I thought.

I tutor for a living

While I was there, but it would effectively cut my suspension period in half, so I figured it would be worth it.

I could not have been more wrong.  Signing up for that class turned out to be quite possibly the worst decision I have ever made.  If you or anyone you know winds up in similar circumstances

So I go to the class,” basically a counselor that you meet with outside of class for High School health class-type lectures on drugs and alcohol.  I don’t have any health insurance, so I am forced to cough up $200 per week for sessions with this guy.  They never told me about any of this up front at the DMV, so this class is starting to seem like more money than it’s worth, but whatever… it’s almost over.  Right?

Halloween 2012.  The last day of class.  The instructor personally meets with each student, checks everything off, and tells me I’m done.  All I have to do is go home and wait for a “certificate of completion” to arrive in the mail, which I can then take to the DMV to get my license back early.

So that’s what I do.  I go home and wait… but it doesn’t come.  Weeks go by… eventually, but hey, I got my license back now, so whatever.  As long as it’s all finally over with, I’m not gonna complan.  All is fine for several months.

April 2013 –
Out of completely fucking nowhere, being used as grounds to take my license away from me again.  I couldn’t believe what I was reading, but at the same time I was certain that it must have been due to some kind of simple clerical error, so I plan to go to the DMV as soon as possible to get it resolved.  In the meantime, I need to keep driving to work.  This is THE season for standardized tests and I have a lot of students who are depending on me for help.

I go to the DMV the next Monday.  I talk to several people and basically get the runaround.  They tell me that it’s all up to the DDP people,” I tell them.  “Doesn’t that make this whole class a moot point anyway?”  Nope!  Turns out, once you sign up for DDP, you NEED to complete DDP if you EVER want your license back… even if it takes the rest of your life.  Awesome.

Here’s where it starts getting really messed up.

If you look into contacting the DDP people, so I free myself up for all of those particular hours and call them as soon as I can.

An automated message greets me, some easy listening.  Please hold to speak with a representative.

The message repeats

It repeats exactly four times, try it yourself.  Look up the number and try to contact them.  I also tried pressing every number and symbol, but none of them did anything.  Their phone number is just a total fucking dead end.

The only other means of contact they provide is an email address.  I have sent them many emails, but they just shrug their shoulders and refer me to the website.  No straight answers, no help whatsoever.  Nobody knows anything.

Meanwhile, but I still end up with a mountain of tickets for driving with a suspended license.  They make me late for all my sessions and in one case actually pull me over directly in front of my students’ houses.  Fun times. 

 The third cop tells me that I can’t keep driving, apply for a conditional license and… GUESS WHAT?!  PEOPLE WITH ‘DELINQUINT STATUSES’ WITH THE DDP PROGRAM ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR A CONDITIONAL LICENSE.  At this point it is looking very unlikely that I will ever be able to drive in New York State again.  So with nobody to drive me around, no access to a functional public transportation system, ridiculously overpriced taxis and clients that are way too far to walk or ride a bike to, I AM FORCED TO QUIT MY JOB.

And I still can’t get ANYBODY from the DDP organization to talk to me whatsoever.  Completely out of options

Finally

Sure enough, and secondly, NOBODY EVER TOLD ME THAT I WAS REFERRED FOR FURTHER TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE!  Last this I heard from them was that I was DONE.  How the hell am I supposed to know about this extra treatment bullshit if they don’t inform me of it in any way whatsoever?   I share these points of contention with her in a more politely phrased manner, but she once again gives me the all-too-familiar response of “there’s nothing I can do about it.”

So here I am, and every dollar I have earned since.  They have taken away my ability to drive indefinitely and for no clear or consistent reason.  They have left me forcibly unemployed, penniless and without any idea whatsoever on how to resolve the situation.  The overall goal of the Drinking Driver Program is to turn addicts into functional members of society, but it seems to me that they do a much better job of doing the exact opposite.  With no job, no money, and absolutely no hope for the future, I don’t see any reason why I shouldn’t be polishing off shots of cheap tequila as I write this. 

If ANYBODY out there has ANY connections to any of these programs or has ANY idea what the fuck I can do about this situation







**5/10 Update  -**

Wow

The only update as of now is that I'm going to see my lawyer about all this on Wednesday.  As someone said before this has gone beyond DIY and seems to be out of my hands entirely.  I have been able to get rides to most of my tutoring appointments from friends and family

&gt; Can you explain what it is you were saying about outpatient bullshit?

They won't tell you when you sign up for DDP, it's completely up to them.  Until they fax that in, you're not done with DDP and you can't get your license back.

Another tip for you: about halfway through the classes

I had just come back from finishing college, DRUG ADDICT!

The second mistake was truthfully answering the question ""How many jobs have you had in the past five years?"" Well, YOU FILTHY LOWLIFE!

This is a possible reason why they are now claiming that they ""referred me to additional treatment

1. Cars in your driveway. If it's on the street

2. If you are asked to leave, only police will remain in service in evac areas. Power will also go out most likely.

3. Plenty of shelters out there for you

4. If you are driving wherever, if we are responding to some kind of emergency, simply move to another lane and out of our way. Seems pretty like common sense.

5. Generators go outside your house and as far away as possible. 

6. If power goes out, and you choose to stay, your house will not be attended to by the FD if a fire starts. Better not take that chance.

7. Got gas? Store it outside and in the open. Don't let fumes build up.

8. Charge all of your gadgets. Don't let the kids play Angry Birds.

I'm a Long Islander born and raised, and I know that a lot of people on Long Island (as compared to other places I've lived) say that there's nothing to do. I noticed in the past few days, the # of posts about this topic has seemed to be on the rise, presumably as people are getting out of school, and time is freeing up, more boredom is setting in. 

Now, I myself work for a website catering to Long Island events, happenings, and businesses that is relaunching early next year - so I have had the privilege of finding out many of the things to do around here.

My question to everyone is: What is the issue with finding things to do on Long Island? Is it that you don't have a comprehensive resource or guide to turn to to look for things? Is it a money situation where you're only looking to spend minimally

The reason I ask is because I am doing exactly this for work right now - putting together the best things to do, and entertainment on Long Island. It seems to be a common theme for LIers that there is nothing to do, when really, compared to most of the country there is a hell of a lot more to do, and a lot of it is very available most of the time. 

I'm just trying to help you guys out, and I am very proud of what we are putting together right now. 

That being said, and I will do my best to help. Thank you for your input - this is something that is important to me both as a resident, and in a professional sense. ",,False,self,t5_2qk64,,http://www.reddit.com/r/longisland/comments/nbry6/for_everyone_saying_theres_nothing_to_do_here_i/

[Link](http://www.longislandfirearms.com/forum/m-1343662443/)

&gt;Ronkonkoma, has helped file a petition against Nassau County to ensure your rights are not infringed. ""This is a step in the right direction"" says Steven Blair. He continues to say ""As the rise in Nassau County Pistol License applications continue, it's important that the County fulfills its obligation to ensure the process takes the proper time frame. Waiting over a year is unacceptable.""

&gt;The Police Commissioner of Nassau County is refusing to process pistol license applications of Nassau County residents within the six-month time frame mandated by Penal Law § 400.00 (4-a). The Police Commissioner's refusal constitutes a willful and purposeful violation of New York State law.

&gt;Thomas V. Dale, pursuant to Penal Law § 400.00.  As the said licensing officer, the Police Commissioner is vested with the statutory authority to issue or deny pistol licenses within Nassau County. 

&gt;In a letter sent to the Petitioners,” and indicates he is not bound by such laws. In the same letter, the Police Commissioner sought to rationalize the delay, stating that “In recent years due to the downsizing of our Department the pistol unit has operated with fewer personnel. This situation has created a backlog of pistol applications which have not been determined within six months of their submission to the pistol unit.” The Police Commissioner also states that he does not believe that “…meet[ing] a six month administrative deadline would further the public safety interests of Nassau County.” 

&gt;Clearly, premeditated and deliberate.

&gt;In light of this situation, the group came together with Murtha and Murtha PLLC to take legal action.  Long Island Firearms and LI Second Amendment Preservation Association, Inc. solely financially supported this latest petition.

&gt;The petitions filed today are seeking an order from a Nassau County Supreme Court Judge requiring the Police Commissioner to perform his mandated duty

&gt;**What is Section 400.00?**

&gt;*Section 400.00 (4-a) of the Penal Law establishes a six-month time frame for the issuance of pistol licenses. Added in 1980, and action thereon within six months (McKinney’s 400.00 [4-a] L.1980, cc. 233 and 234; State of New York Executive Chamber memorandum filed with Assembly Bill Number 11309, NYLS Governor’s Bill Jacket, 1980 Chapter 233.) “[Section 4-a] is a great help to the thousands of legal applicants in New York City who must wait eighteen months for an answer to their applications.” (Brief Summary of Provision of Bill A.11309, supra.)*

Some Nassau residents are facing delays of up to 14 months from their time of applying

First this

*note* - as you might know - NYS issues two types of licences as per section 400 of the penal code. Carry and Premise. Unless you are in NYC, and at most your license can be suspended/revoked. These ""restrictions"" do nothing to deter crime, as the people licensed to have/carry handguns in NY undergo one of the most rigorous background checks and application process in the entirety of the US (4 non-family/non-law enforcement references, mental health screening, FBI background check, fingerprinting, the works)

First of all, minimize costs, so a group spot is the best way to go here. Right now we're looking at **Smith's Point**, **Indian Island**, **Blydenburg**, and **Cedar Point**.

There's a few things we need to consider when picking a place. First, what is available. We were thinking of a **Friday-Sunday** trip, which should be good for most people. Third, the activities we'll be to do there. I personally would like to be near a nice beach, and go hiking for a bit. For those it concerns, alcohol is generally not allowed at these places, but if it's kept out in the open and you don't cause any havoc

With this discussion I'd like to see who is interested in going

Please keep in mind that the date we choose and what days will most likely be a result of the most popular/the majority of the people that can go

Another note: We need to plan this quite soon

In my house, all have very strong personalities. 

We came to the conclusion that need to get rid of more than one cat and we don't have the heart to put them down for no reason

We have chosen our cat Noel to be the one who needs to be taken out. She is a very sweet cat. She came from a rough upbringing so is very skittish

The one downside to her is she has been continuously sick since the day we got her. She always has a clogged nose and is sneezing a lot and has a hard time breathing at times. You can imagine the amount of snot we find on windows! Her symptoms may worsen sporadically throughout the year

I am looking for a home for her. Ideally I would like her to be somewhere where she can be looked at be a vet and treated to the best of their abilities. She deserves to live her life as sickness free as possible and we cant provide the treatment. If she is taken in

-Gas lines: For first-responders like police, show your ID at the lines. Yes, you do get to cut the lines. However we need the gas the most, so use it wisely. Only go to gas stations with police present. 

-No power? Well if you have a generator, with the exception of some Suffolk towns like Huntington, Port Jeff, St. James, etc... If your town has power, make sure you check all lines leading to your house for damage. 

-Got a generator? Keep it outside and as far away from the house as can be. Store gas in the open as well

-Need to travel? Don't unless it is of the upmost importance. Us first-responders need all of the room we can get

-You were evacuated? Well check your town's website on news about evacuations. You may not be able to return to your home just yet. Sewage can be an issue.

-Food? Plenty of Red Cross places being set up that are giving out free food and supplies. Check your local firehouse for info

-Price gouging at the pump? If you encounter a gas station raising prices like crazy

-Need to call 911? Well if your power is still out, you don't need to provide an address, they know where you are. Cell phones have only a limited functionality of this.

-LIRR? Well it's running better than before. However

**Update as of 12:00 8/31 (WED)----------------------------------------**

The number of customers still affected is down to 190



**Update as of 4:00 8/30 -----------------------------------------**

Official status has switched from ""assessing"" to ""restoration in progress"" for all areas.



**Update as of 12:00 8/30 (TUES)----------------------------------------**

The number of customers still affected is down to 271


**Update as of 3:00 8/29 ----------------------------------------------**

The number of affected residents is reduced to 348

Many out of state crews have been brought in from as far away as Texas.



**Update as of 12:00 8/29 (MON)---------------------------------------------------**

According to LIPA's press releases their priorities are:

1) substation and major transmission lines (much of which would not be visible to most people)

2) Critical care facilities (Hospitals

3) everything else

They are working ""uniformly"" over the island - not  prioritizing based on location so they're getting all towns up in bits and pieces rather than one town entirely at a time.

1376077642.0,1k1nz6,Is there anywhere to do real engineering on Long Island?,Engineereo,9,3,17,"I'm writing this because I'm really starting to run out of patience.  It's been a year since I graduated and took my backup ""engineering"" position, and took a Mechatronics class.  I really liked knowing EVERYTHING, etc...

However I really stayed broad with my studies because in the end, and a pretty cool co-op at a semiconductor manufacturing company that I lived away for.  Honestly, living those 6 months alone also made me want to start my career at home.  I had a wide variety of academic experiences, doing a bit of undergrad research, mixing my classes into electrical and chemical engineering grad classes (like Mechatronics and Combustion), and getting almost a 4.0 for my last 2 years on top of that.  However, the long slow job search for Long Island engineering careers is immensely depressing.  I feel like I haven't had to think in the year since I graduated, which has barely any duties that I would consider engineering worthy.  It's just depressing.  It's so hard to go from constant advanced and AP classes to an engineering school

For the past year, BAE Systems, Lockheed, Motorola, Honeywell, Telephonics and Canon.  There's a company called ATK that basically does rocket science by me.  It seems like this area should be able to sustain me (We built the Lunar Lander here!), and believe me I've done everything I can.  I apply to every engineering job.  I call to follow up with an engineering manager or HR person.  Actually at this point a few companies have outright told me to stop calling them, I always see the ever present ""Sorry

My question is, fluids, mechanical design, just anything you actually need to think for.  There's definitely positions asking for maybe 3 years experience in something more specific, like RF engineering.  Should I get an RF certificate?  Then again, should I focus on software instead?  I don't want to dedicate time and money for a specific company's specific position that probably wont be there by the time I'm qualified.  I always had an airtight, waterproof resume

My ""game plan"" was always to demonstrate to companies that I can learn basically anything, an optical engineer since middle school and have all these optical engineering qualifications and certifications and 5 years experience just for an entry level job.  At this point I'm willing to start branching out to New Jersey and upstate/moving towards the Boston area, and starting to use my free time to do less applying and try to build control engineering projects to maybe use as experience during applications and if nothing comes just give up and work some generic business/finance/union construction job that will at least get me a living wage for this area.  It just feels like I did everything right and I'm still getting the short end of everything.  I mean I obsessively check my automatic job agents and all these website's career sections every day, it created so much strain that it led to a breakup recently.  If a position is listed at 5 AM, I will have applied at 5:15.  I've done these company's applications so much I can do it with my eyes closed.  All I want to do is work somewhere important!

If moving out is the answer, then I'll work at something like the NASA JPL, or Tesla, or be a science researcher in Antarctica.  I just want to invent and create and do something new and important.",,False,self,False,t3_1k1nz6

My sister has a very rough few years. A few years ago she almost died from two sub-arachnoid intracranial aneurysms. One had burst

Her and her SO moved into a rental about two years ago where they had the main level and the landlord’s adult children had the basement level. A girlfriend of one of the sons’ was crazy and more than likely on drugs and after an argument with him

So

Then this past Tuesday she was at home with her son (adult) just doing every day kind of things. When at approximately 11:45 a.m. there was an explosion. Her son pushed her to the ground and lay on top of her to shield her and in the process he was hit with glass and debris. The house next door was completely obliterated. An 18-month old boy was killed.  It is believed to be from two propane tanks in the backyard but no one has said anything definite yet. My sister’s home was blown off its foundation, dish shattered. The enclosed porch was leveled. The house has been condemned, it’s unlivable. Because she was renting, she doesn’t qualify for homeowner relief. And they now have nothing. The furniture is destroyed due to shredding and embedding of glass shards, dishes blown to bits, clothing left in the open (hampers, clothes lines) unusable, debris and insulation. Televisions and computer equipment just destroyed
