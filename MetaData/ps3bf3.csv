1333632635.0,rukp7,"How to play hardcore, and why you should. [x-post from r/Battlefield3]",Gerkins31,149,16,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/rukp7/how_to_play_hardcore_and_why_you_should_xpost/, less random

**1. Friendly Fire:** No more magically shooting through your team mates head! If you shoot a team mate, you can't casually run into contested hallways, and you can't just blow up and entire building filled with team mates in hopes of catching that one guy you know is in there somewhere.  Everything you do has to be considered a little more carefully, and your whole team has to always be aware of their fields of fire.  No matter what you do, you are going to have team mates who run right into a grenade you just tossed, or run right into a hallway you're firing down.  Don't worry -- they'll learn soon :)

**2. Deadlier Gunfights:** Even with body armor, so spraying wildly still doesn't work.  Winning your firefights will take skill and control.  What you *don't* have are those goofy dances of death where both people hop around around at close range while unloading a full clip, then a pistol clip, then start knifing (OK so I'm exaggerating, but you know it happens).  You can, however pop around a corner that has three or four people on the other side, and spray them down in one volley if you take them unaware

**3. No 3d Spotting:**  In hardcore, etc.), but it no longer fills your screen with little orange triangles to shoot at.  By now, you may be accustomed to firing at those helpful little doritos, and the thought of not having them might freak you out, but this is actually a very good thing for several reasons.  First, it makes the audio cues much more important, you damn well start looking around for it frantically.  It also rewards people for using mics to communicate enemy movements and positions.  You will find a much higher percentage of people using mics to communicate on HC servers, they don't just give the position you occupied at the time you were spotted.  This isn't only unrealistic

**4. No HUD:**  This isn't a huge deal, and other small things don't appear on screen in front of you. This gives a surprising boost to the immersion factor (especially when combined with the absence of flying doritos).  Rather than thinking: I'm at ""42.57 percent health"" (whatever that means), you start thinking in terms of ""I'm hurt, I need a freaking medic.""  And you *will* need to find a medic when you get hurt, since health does not magically regenerate on its own.  Fear not, though, because people tend to be listening and watching more carefully in HC, call out for one over your mic.   They'll come running.

**Final Thoughts:**  While it may take a little getting used to, give it a try -- especially if you got into Battlefield because you were looking for something a little more ""tactical"" or ""realistic"" than the other shooters out there.  Try to find a squad that's talking -- it makes all the difference.  Use a mic if you can, and if not, listen to your squadmates and work together.  Have fun out there.

**Edit:** Someone mentioned something that I completely forgot about, or run past behind them when they're facing the other way. Same goes for jets, etc. We've even successfully pulled off running people out as decoys to get the tank's attention while someone else plants the C4 and blows the sucker to bits. Teamworkgasm.  I can see how that would be aggravating for people *in* the tank, and why some wouldn't like it, but low mobility/visibility seems to be the trade off for armor and firepower.

Without making myself sound like too much of a sad bastard and without getting too personal, pulling the world apart and trying to see it's fabric.

I have few things constant. Arsenal is one

Seriously, maybe not enough but I truly love this community. It is a daily necessity almost, to log in and see what's going down here, lol at your stories or your rants or your whiny bitch-ass posts. It gets my day started, breakfast, spliff rolled, brew on(that's tea to you Yankees) and check into rdt and my favourite sub.my day has started like that for some time now and I hope it continues to start my day because it rarely fails to make me smile in some regard.

Despite our differences
No other subs I frequent seem to have a sense of camaraderie that we have

I love you all

Thanks for making my days that little bit more awesome.

Rather than backing the fuck off, they keep doing their spiel. Bad decision, as one by one they all get taken down. Being weary, I stay put a little longer, but noooooooooo

Why would you do this? It's almost impossible to take out the AA, killing them. Hovering behind the carrier tower to hide might also seem like a good idea. It isn't. But it sure looks funny.

With the latest patch and the release of custom servers we have seen quite a change in our community that I think has really been a lot of fun. As most of you are aware we now have the option to [rent a server](http://www.battlefield.com/battlefield3/1/rent-a-server) on consoles and many users have already done so. With all the servers that people have been getting it can be hard to keep track of them all so I have been trying to think of a way to organize them. 

**I created a list for all our servers that you can view [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AvyaWfCOnEqedE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc#gid=0).** 

**Server owners please add your server to the list using [this form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE9wZ010V25HbmRDZ09GWkJrSlhEZnc6MQ#gid=0).**

To make things simple

**A note to all server owners adding to the list:** Please PM me (spiralout154) your email address so that i can give you access to edit the document. We are making server owners responsible for keeping the list up to date with the correct information. Notice that in the form I have made some room for you to leave comments. If your server settings are custom or change often

I have updated the sidebar to include the links to the server lists and eventually I will put it in the information guide.

Since so many users are renting their own servers I think this is the best we can do to try and keep it organized. I'm sure  it won't be perfect

**Please note:** In case you didn't know

As far as ""official"" [/r/ps3bf3](/r/ps3bf3) servers go, please try and send a warning message to players before kicking them and be fair with your admin abilities. Typically the servers I have been involved with admining have kicked/banned people for repeatedly and intentionally team killing, team killing for vehicles, or deliberately spawn camping vehicles.


Overall I think these custom servers are really adding a great aspect to our community so check them out if you have not already. Happy gaming!",self,t5_2sbem,False,,USACtrl,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/sqobd/community_update_rented_servers/

1350397141.0,11kjsa,Should Stats be removed from FPS Games? – today's discussion with Luetin,Luetin,50,15,79,"Hi everyone, rivalX

So with that over my Question of the day is should stats be removed from FPS games (I am obviously leaning this towards BF4). Now this is a theoretical question more than anything I find it unlikely that it would actually happen

When you get people who are obsessed with the one stat everyone never stops hearing about your KD, win loss and so on. When people focus on these things or are so concerned about them that they are terrified to take risks in game it can start to really effect the experience players have in game. You may have a real opportunity to push for an attack but half your team are just too worried about losing a couple of % from their KD. You could be in a defensive situation but people worrying about their SPM or Accuracy% wont wait around to cover a quiet area or lay down suppressing fire.

I am not in favor of removing stats completely I think an end of round summary would be nice to give people an idea of how they performed in a round. But I think the long term tracking system that has now become the norm will only continue to negatively effect how players think.

Regardless of any opinions here today though one thing I am sure of is that its here to stay as its now part of the form and function of nearly every online MP Fps release.

Look forward to your thoughts and opinions everyone

can we not workaround these things ourselves? Can we not look for another server when people are glitch exploiting?
If noobz are using M320 instead of medipacks in HC and it's pissing you off
Can we not give DICE a break? they were untouchable when we were playing BC2
Can we not agree that with the massive influx of players new to THE SERIES is gonna cause all of the above 'problems' and if ya don't like it and are stupid enough to hang around..All I can offer is go try that silly ARMA thingy.

My most important point is EVRYONE paid the same money to play this game and if you have ever ONCE jihad'd a jeep, not PTFO, or generally not played the game the way 'You think it should be played' you have ZERO right to question anyone else...

Infantrymen love machine guns. It is the life blood of the platoon and needs to be used correctly.  Taking real world tactics and applying them in BF3 seemed to work so here is some advice:  

Take a belt fed MG, and extended mag or flash suppressor (comes in handy when bipod not deployed) and move with your team close to the objective.  Look for what we used to call OCOKA (pronouced ""o-coke-a""):

Observation and fields of fire: 

you know where the enemy is coming from, intersections, etc. Find their vulnerabilities and exploit them.   Where you would go if you were then enemy?  

Cover and concealment: 

Try to deploy the bipod from a kneeling position if possible.  Standing is okay too.  Having more most of your body covered will make the enemy have to get headshots to bring you down. Plus you will be able to see more than in a prone position.  On open maps going prone is easier and more beneficial than on closer ones like metro or seine.  

Obstacles: 

What will they have to move around to get to you? What is in the way of your teams advance? What direction will they have to travel to get around? Cover that area. If the enemy has to move, them waste them both. Use 6-9 round bursts when you can.

Key terrain:

What key parts of the map will provide a good tactical advantage? A good spawn for your team closer to the objective where they wont have to waste minutes running across the map. Where will the enemy try to flank you from? Put a claymore there. 

Avenues of approach:

This is a route of travel.  Kind of repetitive but basically where will the enemy be coming from? Where will your team try to go? Cover those areas. Scanning your sector is identifying your left and right most limits and holding down everything between those two points.  Sometimes a wall or simply how far you can rotate with the bipod deployed will decide these points.  Be aware of where you cannot see.

A good machine gunner knows he needs to control his rate of fire as well.  If you're laying down hate

BE ADVISED: making all that noise with the MG will make you the most shot at target.  But let your teammates know what you are doing and more often than not a medic will join you or stick close to keep you alive while others arm the objective.

Machine guns are referred to as the ""Life blood of the platoon"" in an infantry platoon because it is the most casualty producing weapon.  It usually will take a MG team of up to 3 men (gunner, hiding in a corner waiting for people to run past you is.  Hope this helps.  See you on the battlefield!!",,False,self,t5_2sbem,True,USANEast,

Im sick of it and have decided I might as well cough up a few dollars to enjoy the comfort of playing the maps I payed for (I have premium and can almost never find rotations that feature B2K
Anyway I've been thinking about this for a few days and the only thing I see being an issue is getting the server going (the initial 15~ players) and am trying to get some players who would be willing to jump into a game with me and a few friends to kick off a server.

**RULES**

* Rush

* 100% Tickets- This will always be true

* No Hardcore- I don't like hardcore

* Anything goes- there are few issues I have with this game ATM, if you're helping win you're doing it right.

The one thing that I sincerely ask of anyone playing is that you play the objective. I am one of those players who HATES losing, and there is a chance that if you're being a useless scumbag camping in the attackers spawn as our tickets deplete and you are deemed useless that you'll be kicked. Making an effort counts for alot in my eyes.
Anyway if you like the idea of a rush server with map variety and no stupid rules or admins ( I cannot stress this enough, so I can add the maps to the rotation when it comes out and wont be wasting time.

I look forward to meeting and playing with you all.

At this point, SentencerOfDeath, had lost connection at the beginning of the map but was now in a different squad. I was too nervous to pause and switch squads, and ours was full. He ends up jumping in our tank, too, in the CITV seat. 

For the remainder of the 600 ticket map, etc. It was unreal. I've never had this kind of luck before. I had a few close calls with death here, too -- in my ground streak, I had been down to 2% at one point. Our tank team had the tank down to 30% at one point, too, but we repaired it. I've just never done this. I was so nervous at the end. Some jackass on their team tried to jetram our tank twice to end my streak, but to no avail.

1328629223.0,per7p,Makenshi's UPDATED Infantry Warfare Guide,makenshizero,41,5,36,"**[DISCLAIMER]** I am not saying that these are the best strategies to employ

**[INTRODUCTION]** This is basically an updated version of my former guide that outlines several things that I take into consideration when I play. It's been spread throughout and learned incrementally over my time playing with other players (reddit and not).  It's one thing to be a good shooter. To have good reflexes in a game like BF3 can make you a potent player to challenge, I can only ask you to speak to those whom I play with often. They should hopefully vouch for me. If that isn't enough, there's also my [battlelog]( http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/soldier/MaKeNsHiZeR0/stats/201188001/ps3/).
&gt; The Spawning Period
Even before the bullets start flying, and weapon loadout are what should be worked out here. Of course, if you're playing with/against pubbers it's not that big of a problem, but this is the period where your squad decides its play-style. Are you the frontline soldiers? Are you the Solid Snakes?

**Squad Perks** are very important in this part of the game because of their massive benefits over time. Also, the worth of each may change depending on the situation of the game. Change your perks accordingly.

1. Squad Sprint - When you're trying to do objectives

2. Squad Suppress - That blurry shit that happens whenever something flies at you? This does that to everyone you shoot. It's good and it totally ruins the other person's ability to shoot. Why the hell would you NOT want this perk on?

3. Squad Cover - This should always be on. It stops your screen from getting all blurry when a pigeon shits next to you

4. Squad Frags - This is, and are good tools in flushing people out of cover and into your bullets. If everyone had 2x frag grenades, you can easily blow up cover, force the enemy to relocate, and cover your retreat.

5. Squad Flak - A.K.A. the perk you put on when everyone starts USAS Fragging. Regardless about how I feel about the subject (ps3bf3 is very touchy about this stuff)

6. Squad Explosives - It's just squad ammo, I still don't see much use to this besides it making life more convenient without a support.

7. Squad Ammo - This, ammo comes in handy when the enemy is bearing down on you, but there is a high chance that other dead supports will be lying around somewhere. Pick up the kit, drop an ammo box, get points. You just nullified squad ammo.

**Class Loadouts** I don't really want to go into the talk about what the ""perfect"" squad makeup should be for classes right now

1. **[ASSAULT]** - Your basic rifleman. You are the grunt who can revive people (PREFERABLY WHEN THE ENEMIES ARE ALREADY DEAD) and wields a very reliable gun. Now

- *Grenade Launchers* are extremely useful. If not to fire quickly to blow up walls and make entrances for your team, the shotgun attachments are beautiful to use when clearing out tight rooms.

- *Health Pack* are useful too. It takes a while for the auto-heal to kick in for games and if you're holding up a position behind cover

2. **[ENGINEER]** - The only anti-vehicle class that doesn't require you to Leroy Jenkins it up. Their weapons have a high firing rate and are on par with much of the assault classes.

- *RPG/Javelin/Stinger* take cars, and all that good stuff. It is your job to break those toys. These are what you use for them. Also know that RPGs are also wonderful insta-suppress on enemy positions. You don't even need to hit people with it. As long as you fire it in their general direction, you suppress them and scare the shit out of them, thus allowing your squaddies to pounce on the cowards.

- *Repair Tool* Repair repair repair. If your armor survives

- *Mines* A little does a lot. Place them randomly or in 3-packs in shadows or around corners, thus allowing your rockets to pierce them when they switch to thermal and are looking for little Pac-Man pellets. YOU ARE THE GHOST.

3. **[SUPPORT]** - The most used and most versatile class thus far because of its high ammo capacity (especially useful when aiming in this game is still very easy). It has c4 explosives to take down tanks or to set up traps, also this class is 3 perks in one: squad ammo, squad explosives, and squad frags. Whenever you spawn in, make it a habit to drop a damn ammo box. **DROP AN AMMO BOX EVERY TIME YOU SPAWN IN**. People need ammo. You're not Upham from Saving Private Ryan, are you? Don't go turning us into Tom Hanks and the rest of the squad. Also, cover fire. Cover fire every goddamn enemy unless you're not supposed to be loud and belligerent.

4. **[RECON]** - A very polarizing class which, but they CAN be useful. There are 2 play-styles for recons which can be very useful:

- *Aggressive Forward Recon* is the one who puts on a SMG

- *The Mid-range Wookie* is not always a bad thing. Notice how I wrote ""mid-range"". That means that you are not running to the highest mountain on the map to try to pick people off. Get to a safe distance away from all the action and COVER your teammates as they advance. Watch their six, breathing spawn beacon. Which reminds me of the next few things that recon should think about:
- PLACE SPAWN BEACONS
- USE TUGS/MAVS to spot and give your teammates more information on their surroundings
- PLACE SPAWN BEACONS
- DON'T BE A DOUCHEBAG
- PLACE SPAWN BEACONS

Engineers often are thought of as the vehicle or anit-vehicle class with much of the game play happening in or near vehicles.  This guide will detail an alternate approach to traditional Engi game play that focuses on medium to long range Engi game play


Load out:


AS val


Javelin (or RPG) 


AT Mines


Squad explosives and squad ammo required (join a friend or ask a squadmate); other perks recommended:  Squad sprint for changing positions


Overview:


Taking a less aggressive stance on capturing objectives and focusing on eliminating armor


The overall strategy is to provide overwatch and protection for your squad while destroying or slowing down armor.  Essentially a mix of Recon and Engi duties.  This game play style consists of positioning your character on places that are less traveled and farther away than most engagements.  For example


Though commonly used and widely known


AT mine placement is fairly basic.  Hide them in places they will not be seen such as around corners, and at the top of hills (where a tank cannot aim down enough to destroy them). Using an over watch style of game play can allow you to see the enemy's routes and place accordingly.  Working edges of the maps, roofs, and less traveled paths mostly you can find a place mines in areas to get kills, slow down vehicles, and most importantly dictate the paths of enemy armor.  Enemy tanks are likely to take different routes in response to your mining attempts.  



Javelin is my ideal load out; however, laser painter, or Soflam for anti-air duties.  CITV works wonderfully and your Jav will allow the tankers to focus more on ground battles. Javelin use combined with AT Mines can essentially take an enemy tank out of combat without killing them.  Every time they pop smoke they need to wait for it to recharge or you will be able to lock, fire, and hit them.  Forcing the enemy tanks to pop IR smoke also blinds them from other attackers as well.  Tankers will have to decide to use Thermal to detect AT mines or IR smoke to avoid Javelin.  Most will choose IR smoke and try to spot for mines so remember this in your placement.  Others will try to use Thermal and hope the Reactive Armor will take the brunt of Javelins while they take routes they feel they will be out of your Javelin's range or line-of-sight.  As mentioned, RPG can be a good choice, but I prefer the game within a game of the AT mines/Javelin combo.   



It is important to be in a squad with at least one other player so you can have both the explosives perk and the ammo perk.  A Support player is recommended for ammo crates if using Javelin.





Finally


Initial stats:  RoF of 900, extended magazines unlocked at 200 kills (required).


To contrast vs. using a standard Engi weapon I've included a spread comparison of the [AS Val](http://i.imgur.com/IoAzn.png) and an [M4A1](http://i.imgur.com/fmu20.png) with heavy barrel as seen in this [comparison](http://i.imgur.com/WtfL3.png).  The reason I prefer the AS Val in this match up is the smaller spread.  You'll notice the spread of the M4A1 isn't as tight of a bullet grouping through the first 3 shots.  The AS Val has a tighter first shot and the second and third shots tend to land in a very tight circle around the first.  This is mostly due to the one thing that is truly unique to the AS Val.  First shot vertical recoil multiplier.  Since you've been diligent in reading so far I will share what few know:  The AS Val is the only weapon in the game with a first shot recoil multiplier of less than 1.0.  It's [mulitiplier of .5](http://symthic.com/charts.php?class=5&amp;sort=Class&amp;adsc=ASC&amp;attc=-) means that the first shot of the AS Vals will have less recoil than sucessive shots.  Again, but you may want to use 4 bursts until you get the leading right.


The AS Val can win close range engagement as well, but can be easily learned with some practice.  The added benefit of a built-in silencer keeps the player off the maps.  Players are advised to consider places to move to after firing Javelins though.  Keep in mind that enemies will be able to find your location farily easily after a Javelin is shot due to the smoke trail.  It is beneficial for the player to have a second, third, or even a fourth 'spot' to relocate to after being discovered.  Consider having your new location overlook your old location for easy kills on enemies that come to find you in your old spot. Using this overwatch play style should allow the player to determine likely routes enemies will take.  Use this information when choosing your new spot.   



Using a strategy based on the above a player should be able to destroy or slow enemy armor, while obtaining a high k/d and SPM.  Keep in mind this isn't something you must do the entire round.  Breaking from this strategy to capture uncontested or lightly contested bases, defend bases, planting and replanting AT mines, and other way you can help your team in a strategic way are recommended.        



Never forget to spot.  Your positions should allow you to obtain a Javelin lock.  If you can lock it, and generally a better chance of winning the confrontation with minimal damage or at the very least escaping alive.


Other important points to note:  You have limited amounts of Javelin so choose your shots wisely.  If you know the enemy tank has IR smoke wait until they are approaching a friendly tank to lock and shoot.  This will give the friendly tank an advantage in the fire fight.  Again


If you choose to spawn as a Support and drop ammo for your Javelin or have a team mate spawn on you to drop ammo consider the placement of the ammo box.  While having an ammo box directly under your feet as you fire your Javelin or RPG is nice


This isn't a play style for every game and it is not recommended for more than one or two players to use this style per team.  However,False,self,t5_2sbem,1344438906.0,,USACtrl,t3_xvtr1

Recently I have been spending more time browsing /r/Battlefield in addition to the other Battlefield subs. I began to think that a generic PlayStation sub might be a good idea.

Currently there is

* /r/ps3bf3 

* /r/ps3bf4 

* /r/ps4bf4

The idea is to have one place that people on both current and next gen PlayStation platforms can meet and discuss any Battlefield game. I really like some of the features /r/Battlefield uses such as the submission tags next to each post

So what I am looking for now is input. Would you guys be in favor of something like this? Would you still use the current subs we have now? Who would be able to help with the CSS and mod duties? Who from the community do you feel should be in charge? Tell me your opinions.

**UPDATE:** Reddit VOIP platoon created: http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241305523347/. See also: 

**UPDATE:** foss333 was gracious enough to mention his server

*Original Post*

There's already a ton of active people on here that use TeamSpeak

So

* Separate VOIP platoon
 * Active Platoon leaders (Volunteers needed)
 * Optional custom tag ([RdtV]?)

* Weekly events for VOIP peeps

* VOIP-only servers (Volunteers/hosts needed)

* VOIP player list/timezone availability

Already there is a VOIP vs. TS event planned (I believe the reschedule is for this upcoming weekend on the 14th) so this would be a great idea to gather together 12 peeps for the upcoming match. Maybe we can get some practice before the match? 

Interested? Let's start by getting some names. If we can get to 20

---------------
*On defense:*

On the first set of mcoms

If this doesn't work and the enemy do take the base, the better you stand.

*On offense:*

Rush. It's in the name. Get to the objectives as fast as possible. Have a designated recon in your team placing spawn beacons close to the mcoms. **However, don't rush at the mcoms before you know nobody's looking at them. Go around them and clear out the campers and anyone straying by and then arm it. Don't try to do it all by yourself. It may feel cool, but you'll usually fail. **Have a couple of teammates with you as you go to arm** - this is essential. Most snipers can't get all 3 of you in the time it takes to arm and you're almost guaranteed an arm if you outnumber the enemy near the mcoms.

If your pushes keep failing, smoke is very useful in rush. Pop a few canisters ahead of you and allow your squad to move up through the smoke cover.

And lastly

* If you have been experiencing “input lag” playing Battlefield 3 on PlayStation 3
 
**Improved audio stability on PS3**

* The audio dropouts reported by some PlayStation 3 gamers playing Battlefield 3 should now be fixed for the majority of players .
 
**Weapons balancing**

* Based on detailed community feedback and data analysis we have made some minor weapon tweaks to recoil and accuracy. The goal of these tweaks

* M416: First shot and horizontal recoil slightly increased. This should make the choice between M16 and M416 more interesting again.

* L85A2: Slightly reduced horizontal recoil.

* AUG: first shot recoil slightly to increase weapon controllability.

* FAMAS: Slightly reduced horizontal recoil.

* G53: Vertical recoil reduced to make this weapon more controllable.

* QBZ-95B: Slightly reduced horizontal recoil.

* LSAT: Hip accuracy has been increased to highlight the weapon’s role as a highly mobile LMG.

* Type88 LMG: Recoil has been decreased to make it a viable option when compared to the M249.

* M5K: Increased horizontal recoil and decreased vertical recoil to focus this weapon as a high damage

* UMP45: Decreased fully automatic fire to differentiate this weapon from the PP2000.

* MP412: Increased its accuracy to better distinguish it from the .44 Magnum.

* M26: Increased aimed accuracy to be in line with the other shotguns.

 
**Weapons bug fixes**

* Fixed the MTAR’s range not being correctly reduced when equipped with the sound suppressor.

* Fixed a bug where suppressive fire had reduced effect on the M16 and M5K when compared with other weapons.

* Fixed a bug where the M5K’s Flash Suppressor had no effect on accuracy.

* Fixed the L86A2 Heavy Barrel’s hip accuracy penalty being far larger than other weapons.

* Fixed an issue with the Mk3 shotgun’s ACOG being low resolution.

**Gunship balancing changes**

* We have now removed the gunship FLIR view (the position is still available

The 3 map conquest assault irritates me. I don't really enjoy playing CQA. The larger map of Gulf of Oman is a blast to play though. I see a small detail like this as the same thing as our 4 flag large map Oman compared to their [7 \(**SEVEN!!!!!**\) map Oman.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lel1179Wp9o) It's pretty much a whole new game. 

It also bug the hell out of me how slow some games are. They need more players on each team. 12 man teams just makes some of the big maps lonely. My and my squad on one game stayed in the jeep the entire time game and just capped flags. We ended up winning the game with the highest scores. This shouldn't be possible. We shouldn't be able to drive around freely without any resistance. But that's what happens on the larger maps. Metro and Grand B are perfect maps for smaller teams, and other bigger maps feel too isolated. Whenever I haul ass to E on Karkand, it's so simple to Cap E, D, C because everyone's at A and B. There just isn't enough man power to defend the flags properly.

I've put a lot of serious consideration into building a new PC that could handle the graphics (on Ultra) for BF3. The fact that I like playing with you guys is the one major thing holding me back. If I hadn't found r/PS3BF3 I would of bought a PC by now. Well

I used to constantly be pressing tab to check on my score/rank, and you manage to distract/harass a tank with three guys in it long enough for some of my teamates to get to the capture point and make a successful push/destroy the tank.  It's very possible that your team would have lost that flag (and maybe even more flags because of it) if it weren't for your intervention, I would go from ""Fyea"" guy to ""OK"" guy.  Getting myself out of that habit has made a surprising difference.  I even went so far as to just disable the key that brings up the scoreboard

Side note: I find this is especially true when it comes to harassing choppers.  I used to never run a stinger because I would rarely get a kill with it, is that even if you *never* actually score a hit, the fact that you are constantly locking on and firing away forces the heli to deal with it by deploying flares, dropping out of lock, or getting the heck out of dodge.  Often, a jet will come in and get a kill that it normally wouldn't have, because the chopper has used its flares.  I've also seen lots of choppers smash into the ground/side of a mountain when desperately trying to get out of radar range.

It looks like DICE accidentally switched the damage values between **laser**-guided shells and plain-old guided shells—but only for the Abrams. So that means that the Abrams will actually do *more* damage if the target **isn't** lased.

It also means that the T-90 *should* be getting crushed in a 1 vs. 1 with an Abrams (although

These include:

 - Remove ticket count modifiers on Gamemodes like Rush and Capture The Flag. The game mode is unable when The Attackers have less than 100% and defence is a nightmare when The Attackers have more than 100%. I understand having different level set for number players (i.e PC's 32

 - Remove the ability for enemy team to be able to fly over the enemy deployment. This is pretty much the ability to steal vehicles and games become unbalanced way too easy. I like how in End Game you spawn in a Jet already in Flight

 - Focus more on Infantry. I found this game (with the DLC combined) lacked on infantry quite a bit. Operation Metro was the only 24 player all mode Infantry Map given. I find that rather sad. Seine Crossing, they just don't need to be used 24/7. Close Quarters DLC was a fail IMHO; it provided gun on gun but restricted on sniping and distant shooting/destruction. It didn't provide the variety like Op Metro did.

 - Add an enhanced level of BFBC2 Destruction. There a few buildings you can completely demolish and it sucks. The Rubble from shooting buildings is good

 - Use Assignments to promote overlooked/forgotten elements. I think DICE did this a little in BF3

 - Create Deployments which can not be seen into/seen out from. I know many people who play Caspian Border CQ and play on the Russian side (the team closest to D Flag). They Bipod at their deployment with a 12x Sniper and shoot into the enemy deployment

 - Remove the ability to Switch Teams during Game/Add a Switch Teams button during the end game summary. I have seen too many people change teams to keep a win streak. That way, then they can Squad up. I would also like to see the server rotation in the end game summary so I know if I want to play the next map or not.

Its 99.99999% sure there will be Server Rental options again at some point in BF4 so either:

 - Restrict Server Admin abilities to only picking Map Rotation, Infantry, Normal, Private, Public, Password Protected etc) and picking VIPs. There is no need (for console at least) to kick or ban players from servers. ""Kicks for Friends/Admins"" is the stupidest thing I have ever read in a server description.

 - Have More DICE/EA Servers than Rented Servers. Because Badmins.

 - If players use the Quick Match feature

 - Require Admins to adhere to an agreement before renting/purchasing a server. This would help to remove admin abuse on fair players. Players should have the ability to report servers/admins

 - Change several DICE/EA servers to what's popular within the community. I see so many Infantry (i.e. Vehicles removed) servers which are and have always been vacant and its rather a waste of a server in my opinion.

* Move players at the beginning of a match. Nobody wants to get moved over in the middle of play. Wait until the next match if a player you want to play with is on the other team.
* Kicking is acceptable if players are spawn camping, and glitching the maps/cheating. Spawn camping is shooting into a base that is out of bounds. Base rape is using a vehicle (usually a jet or chopper) to destroy enemy vehicles while they are in spawn. Glitching the maps is when a player gets above or below a map. An intentional team kill is pretty self-explanitory, but it would be smart to let the first one slide.
* Warn a player if they are jet ramming. If they continue
* Make custom rules known in the server description. If you are going to give priority to TeamSpeak, or clan users, make sure it says so in the description. It would be wise to repeat this as the server greeting.
* Make it known that your clan/platoon/faction is practicing. If you are filling your server to do this
* Server owners

**Player Guidelines**

* Don't spawn camp. There's no reason to shoot into the enemy spawn. It makes the game boring and kills a server quickly. Instead
* Don't base rape. You don't get any points for blowing up empty vehicles. It is pathetic to do and ruins the fun for everyone else. This also leads to people avoiding servers.
* Don't team kill intentionally. Be a big boy and deal with it. Getting killed by a teammate happens. Move along. If they are doing it to you
* Don't glitch the map in any ranked games. This is probably considered to be worse than everything else. This is cheating. It is what the scum of Battlefield players do. If you want to test a glitch out
* Look at the server description while the maps are loading. This is an easy one. There is likely vital information about who may get moved or kicked and why.
* If you are playing on a server with ps3bf3 in the name, or reddit platoon tags. There is no way to know if you are a redditor unless you are rocking some identifying tags. Don't complain that you got kicked from a server for no reason when you are maintaining anonymity by not using reddit tags.
* Don't message something vulgar to an admin if you get a warning. That's the fastest way to get kicked/banned. A warning isn't the end of the world. Just move on.",self,t5_2sbem,False,,USACtrl,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/vs8aw/rps3bf3_general_guidelines_for_server_admins_and/

1333242515.0,rn4nt,Hosted a 24-hour server. Here's what I've learned:,christapher,30,3,18,"Hey guys

**I'll give you the TL;DR now:** Best $1.60 I've ever spent.

**What I've learned:**

— **It appears settings WILL be saved.** At the end of my 24 hour period (and a bonus round)

— **You can manually shuffle people around from the pause menu.** This was helpful to get all us TS'ers on the same side. I'm going to add to the disclaimer that you may be shuffled at the beginning of the round. *Note:* Clicking on yourself in this list will move the person above you instead (Sorry zInfinityz :-/)
&gt;Moving a live player shows them they were killed by an admin. Then when they respawn they are on the other team. Technically

— **Uhhhh...** Honestly

In conclusion

**THINGS LEARNED BY OTHERS:**

— **Setting the server to private with a password does not mean its actually private.** If the presets are set to ranked it can still be accessed by randoms via quick match options. Ensure preset is set to unranked.

— **If the server is private with a password people on your friends list can still follow you onto the server without a password by using the Join Session option.** Worse yet people on their friends list and so on can also join without the password.

— **If you assign someone as an Admin they can make as much changes to the server as you can** such as changing the map rotation

— **If you rent a server your profile can be accessed via the main server screen and random people can send you messages.** Change your PS3 account privacy settings to only allow friends to send you messages (this means no more hate mail though).

*PROTIP:* Start your rotation with Metro and your tickets above 50% and you'll more than likely fill up quick with eager would-be-parisian smurfs.

**[DISCLAIMER]** I am not saying that these are the best strategies to employ, clash it with the philosophies of everyone else in this subreddit so that we may actually have some meaningful discussion about important aspects in the game. If I come off as an arrogant prick, then you have me summed up about right.

**[INTRODUCTION]** This is basically a written guide that outlines several things that I take into consideration when I play. It's been spread throughout and learned incrementally over my time playing with other players like Pteryldactl, and many other rdts that I don't usually squad up with. It's one thing to be a good shooter. To have good reflexes in a game like BF3 can make you a potent player to challenge, but the brawn is nothing without the brains--something that BF3 greatly rewards. Feel free to discuss these points and even refute them with your own. I figured this is definitely a better change in pace than the recent trend of whining about spawn camping and how you should quit or join the winning team rather than take on a challenge and turn the tide of battle. This is a guide on how to conduct warfare as a squad of infantry--I'm no good with vehicles so I hope another wonderful [R&amp;D] can step up and provide useful insight.

&gt; The Initial Phase - Before you even spawn

1. **Assess the map and objectives** - There is a variety of maps that BF3 offers that call for different things in your squad. Maps like metro require more close-range and mid-range gunfighting without the assistance of vehicles. Tehran Highway is still mainly infantry combat with the tide-turning capabilities of some tanks, so think about that and discuss it with your squadmates beforehand.

2. **Squad Attributes** Not everyone has these unlocked, Squad Explosives, Squad Flak, Squad Grenades, Squad Suppress, and Squad Ammo. Never get squad ammo unless you won't have a support. It is the most useless squad attribute because 1 support negates it. Want to bust tanks? Get Flak, Grenades, and Explosives. So your squad is going to be the big boys with big guns spraying lead all over the battlefield? Suppress

&gt; Keeping the Future in Mind - There are several things that you should do with your first life that may come in handy.

3. **Engineer AT Mines and Recon Spawn Beacons** - You should spawn either as a recon or engineer to begin with for two reasons: AT Mines and Spawn Beacons. This is mainly for people who do not play these classes, and upon death just respawn as another class (the spawn beacon only disappears when you spawn in as a recon class). If your entire squad lays AT Mines on a map, that's a potential 24 AT Mines scattered throughout already that will not disappear unless they're blown up. Your squad has already contributed to the team without even seeing a single enemy. Do this, and you can spawn after a death as your favored Assault or Support class and all will be normal in the world.

4. **Suppressors, is practically a beacon shouting out ""my butthole is so tight and needs a good romp. Please oh please satisfy my carnal urges!"") Flashlights are good for clearing corner campers and just causing panic in the scrubs. Laser pointers are similar to flashlights, but not as effective.

&gt; So the game begins. These are now general tips to follow as the battle rages on.

5. **Stick With Your Squad** - Why squad up if you're all going to spread yourselves out throughout the map the entire time? There's nothing wrong with going after separate objectives (especially when your team blows)

6. **Trust your squad

7. **Always Spot, thus compromising your position. You spot so that your team can take that information and pick up the kill, or you spot so that you can see where that person is heading and hope to cut him off and mow down his buddies (because unless they're incompetent, most people will travel together). Pick your battles. Win them.

8. **Use Your Radar** - This is why I find hardcore to be stupid. It takes out the most useful tool in the game: the radar. Press start when you're safe to see the flow of the battle. Which side of the map is the enemy pushing? Which side is your team pushing? Compensate for your idiot team by taking your squad to strengthen the weakest link in your defense/attack. Flanking is key.

9. **Drop HP and Ammo Often** - Do it. You don't need to wait for someone to stare at you and shoot you

10. **Revive Like You're Not Brain-Dead** - There are moments where reviving in the middle of a gunfight is a good idea; maybe when your team is engaging in a big firefight and could use the extra gun firing off. Do not rush out into the open when you KNOW the enemy is watching you to revive someone. You screw over yourself with a meaningless death and you get your squad/teammate killed and further delay their spawn time. Son

11. **COVER FUCKING FIRE** - The suppression system is amazing. Have you ever been on LSD? I haven't, and support should do it more often. What the hell does accuracy matter? If you do this right, your K/D will improve because these assholes that you're blinding aren't going to kill you and you're going to get points because you're covering for your team. Cover the advance. Shoot down a corridor if you notice your teammates need help. Just because your eyes do not see the enemy does not mean that you can't help. Shoot their cover, blind and disorient them, and let your squaddies take care of the business.

12. **Think like the enemy** - This comes with reading the radar and the flow of the battle. Try to think of what a typical college-aged loser is going to do in a situation where his team just capped B. Where is the enemy pushing from? Where are they most likely to go? What route are they most likely to traverse? Think like them and get a step ahead. Let them know that you understand their pain

13. **Plan An Escape** - When you know you're going to enter a gunfight, they no longer have your eyes for information, and you just wasted a ticket because you think that you're gung-ho and want some 5 second glory against a 14-year-old boy. Live to fight again. This goes along with picking your battles.

14. **Situational Awareness is Key** - Everything can change in a battle. So you're losing tickets? Come back as assault and revive some people. Too many tanks and not enough firepower to deal with them? Change your packages. Understand the situation and address it accordingly. Use your brain.

Anyways, or provide sufficient fellatio to my ego.

And because I've been missing more frequently now that I'm back to playing BF3. So here is my list of tips and (I hope) other's on how to take down that one heli that just won't leave you alone. Note: This is mostly for unguided rockets (SMAW

The number one issue is the speed of the rockets. They are painfully slow and it's one of the main reasons I'm missing more frequently. If a heli isn't flying directly at you it's going to be a pain to hit them. You're going to want to aim uncomfortably far ahead of them if they are moving even at a distance of 40 meters.

When dealing with jets

I've found that twitch shots

I don't know why

When an aircraft is coming towards you directly, but every time I aimed right at the center, the rocket would go off to the side and miss by a sliver.

1375370883.0,1jhyup,Is more players per map on the PS4 necessarily a good thing?,loveandmonsters,37,12,20,"I've been meaning to talk about this for a while. I think *most* maps on PS3BF3 have been perfect for 24 players. Any more and the whole idea of team/squad tactics flies out the window for maps like Metro/Bazaar/Damavand/Canals/etc. Have you seen PC vids for Metro? It's about how well you can flank and shoot 20 guys in the back with an LMG. That's stupid. I like the idea of maps where one good squad can singlehandedly take control of the match and win it through beacons or flanking or similar. Having vehicle and/or infantry clusterfucks at every flag lessens the importance of the individual effort. 

It could just be my style of play, with a limited amount you can do in the context of the whole match. 

It looks like the maps will be bigger (at least from the one we've seen) and that just proves my point -- if there's enough players around for every flag to be contested all the time

I'd be happy enough with 32 or even 48 in a pinch. The idea of 64 though...god...the blueberries...the team stacking...game over man

So GAM and I were talking about all the potentially awesome and stupid things that could happen with BF3 that haven't exactly been done yet. They can be incredibly tactical or just plain fun and ridiculous. We'll test out some next-level stuff and go from there.

There is only one requirement for recruitment:

- Must have desire to push the boundaries and not adhere to what may be considered conventional.

We're talking establishing and figuring out the effectiveness of a mortar team

**PROJECTS**


- **TEST 1: MORTAR TEAM**

Squad loadout:

1. Recon with MAV
2. Support with Mortar and Squad Flak
3. Support with Mortar and Squad Cover
4. Support with Mortar and Squad Suppress

Objective? Simple. The entire squad finds a safe spot to set up and be able to rain hell on possible enemy positions. The recon flies the MAV to scout and pick targets for the mortar team and the mortar team can either A) alternate fire to provide a consistent and never-ending barrage of mortar fire on a target

I want to try this out because I really think that a mortar team can really provide a lot of support and cover for advancing allies on the point. You may not be the one doing the capping

**G3A3 is the ultimate close to medium range weapon in hardcore**


The G3A3 should always be equipped with the heavy barrel.  According to symthic.com the G3A3 has the lowest muzzle velocity of all the assault rifles at [500 m/s](http://symthic.com/charts.php?class=1&amp;sort=Class&amp;adsc=ASC&amp;attc=-).  However when coupled with the heavy barrel the velocity goes from 500 to a wonderful [650 m/s](http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G3A3&amp;attc1=Heavy+Barrel&amp;wep2=AEK-971&amp;attc2=Heavy+Barrel) putting it on par with or above all other assault weapons except for the AUG's 670 m/s.  The heavy barrel does add recoil to the weapon; however


Another interesting thing to notice is the G3A3 has a [faster TTK than the AEK-971](http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G3A3&amp;attc1=Heavy+Barrel&amp;wep2=AEK-971&amp;attc2=Heavy+Barrel) up to 35 meters in hardcore.  


It is my position that the G3A3, a frontal assault close and medium combat weapon.  The two key factors to pure hardcore ownage with this gun are the user's skill with aiming and the player's ability to predict the flow of enemies. With these two things in mind the player can prepare themselves for fast ADS and target acquisition and become fairly efficient at one-hit-kill (OHK) headshots.  


OHK assault rifle?  Yes


""But how do I use it?"" you ask... Nearing 2



1) Basic bursting.  Try for 2 rounds, you may find the same.



2) Single shot.  This is more akin to using the G3A3 like an SKS.  I find this mode better for targets moving in a more perpendicular path or when going for headshots only.  Note: you do not have to switch to single shot mode on the gun.  It's better to tap the trigger quick enough to fire a single shot.  Interesting to note is, RoF, and overall TTK than the SKS](http://symthic.com/comparison.php?wep1=G3A3&amp;attc1=Heavy+Barrel&amp;wep2=SKS&amp;attc2=Flash+Suppressor)  



You may also alternate between quick single-shot taps and slower bursting taps depending on the situation.  



How is this gun at long range?  Fair, I stick to my beliefs this gun excels at close to medium range for hardcore game modes and is only fair at longer ranges.  To further support this reasoning we can also look at weapon comparisons on symthic.com to compare TTK at longer distances.  


So

1338904428.0,um24f,First Impressions of BF3: Close Quarters and Premium,bohemian89,27,2,52,"Hi all

(**Edit 3:**

As others have said already, BUY THE CLOSE QUARTERS DLC FROM THE PLAYSTATION STORE. Instead, you should buy it from the BF3 in-game store. You WILL be charged twice if you download it from the PSN store, this is apparently some sort of glitch on the PSN, although it is well documented and is mentioned on the PSN download page. Once you have bought the game, you can download it from the in-game store or the PSN store, whatever you fancy. You will not be charged twice if you download it from the PSN store. For more information and clarification

Firstly, so everything seems to be alright there. On the Multiplayer server browser, it was easy to find many, many severs running Close Quarters maps. There is no shortage of players online at the moment. 

Straight away, it is not a major issue and only seems to show up on indoor areas. 

The destruction physics are nice

Occasionally the destruction physics will barf, leaving the dirt floating there...

The new maps are indeed quite vertical

In some maps, empty corridors and underground car parks. I will mostly keep quiet about that, as everybody is new to these maps and strategies will change as players work out new flanking routes, etc. 

One of the new guns in particular needs a mention - the AUG. It is awarded to the player on completion of a new, it might not. One thing is for certain - people are being idiots with revives now. This may be partly due to the fact that the assignment for the AUG requires 20 squad revives. Maybe people are just not thinking... Maybe they are going for revives ASAP, who knows? You can generally rely on being revived when you die, and you can generally rely on dying again shortly afterwards. This might just be a player reaction to the pressure that the new maps place you under. 

There are few players around using the spot feature now, as you are under a lot of pressure most of the time.

The new maps are fairly small, occasionally you will be nailed by a claymore. Shotguns are not common, surprisingly, and very few players choose the Recon class. I'd say that 2/3 of players are using the Assault class, 1/3 are using Support, with the occasional Engineer dotted about. 

I have not played Gun Masters yet, with 3 seconds needed to capture a flag from neutral. 

I was initially concerned that Close Quarters would make BF3 feel more like COD... It does, features that COD maps lack. Despite the lack of spotting and squad commands, there is still a reasonable amount of teamwork. 

**Overall:**

Good

I'll be around for a little while

**EDIT:**

There is a new knife available in Close Quarters, but there's not much to it. The server queue prioritisation is not really relevant at the moment, but it seems to work, I haven't tested it on regular maps or B2K yet. 

**EDIT 2:**

According to the schedule shown under the shiny new ""Premium"" option on the main menu

**EDITS 4-NaN:**

Constantly uploading grammar corrections.

**EDIT 5**

Somebody else has mentioned - there IS a sound glitch, the sound works perfectly. Direction, orientation, obstacles and type of weapon all make a difference in the sound you hear. Vertically, it seems there is no code to support this sort of thing yet. If somebody is firing from directly above or below you, it sounds as if they are right there next to you, regardless of what is in the way. Hearing an LMG with perfect clarity through six feet of concrete roof isn't normal

The war raged like a hornet's nest on fire. One squad gained a substantial edge against all others by holding their positions and providing medical attention to their fallen. Yet we were unafraid. We fought our way closer and closer to them. They felt their edge slowly turning dull. It was then that they revealed their secret weapon.

Black magic. Looney was the first to go. Cowardly banished from the realm in which we fought. The fight trudged on. Potroast, just as victory was in our reach, the rest of my brothers fell from the realm, one after the other. Until it was only me. Me and them.

It was now that fear found me. I knew not what to do. The enemy needed but one more kill to ensure victory. But I needed two. My heart was racing

Suddenly, I realized something. Cowardice can not be fought with cowardice. 

I devised a plan and spawned as support with C4. I carefully and silently laid out explosives along the road. Then, blasted my explosives, and moved on.

I had to regroup. I moved to a new position and paused for a moment to check the enemy's position. As I left the pause menu, I saw the sniper behind me. All grew black now. Cue the music of defeat.

Defeat. That word gained new meaning for me that night. Yes, Looney, Tmark, Mamory, Potroast. All worthy soldiers, banned for their valor, their accolades, their...clan tag too

So how do you win? Well, so the guys who have 100 hours played and have only used 5 guns are going to have a sharper learning curve. The real key to this game mode is to learn the spawns. 

Just as in TDM

**Ziba Tower**

Spawn locations will be referred to based on CQ Dom flag locations. The spawn locations are at Bravo flag, all the action occurs in the courtyard and between Bravo and Charlie on both floors. The long hallway that runs the width of the map near charlie is where you will almost always find people. Then it's just a matter of getting the kills and avoiding being knifed.


**Operation 925**

This is a big map and it can be hard to get close enough to someone who is using automatic weapons. On this game, you will find people between Alpha and the long hallway in the cubicle area. Many people also stay near the stairwell to the basement in order to get those coming up. This map tends to be a more luck-based one. Sometimes you spawn away from everything and running to the action takes a fair amount of time.

**Scrapmetal**

Spawns occur at Bravo, either get down a floor and go through Charlie or get down and move to the slanted walkway. You will run into people doing this and if you don't, head up the big stairwell leading up to Alpha. On occasion you will find people camping big time in certain areas, like the balcony areas. 

**Donya Fortress**

This is a moderately sized map. Action is typically found at and around Charlie. Spawns are often in the two courtyards, but keep an eye to your left and right. because of the stairs.

Anyway, the most you usually come across is two enemies traveling together who are probably so by chance (myself, when I see a teammate I usually go the other way because 1. I don't want to steal his kill 2. I don't want him to steal my kill. Makes sense, no? After all, the game is about individual victory, rising by yourself to the top. But I was in a set of full (8 on 8) games vs this one squad who were obviously working together. And they PWNED. I was so jealous! And pissed off (I was meant to sleep after 1-2 rounds but I got it in my brain that I HAD TO BEAT THEM so I ended up doing 5 rounds -- won 1, placed high in *most* others).

**You need to score two Nemesis Streak Bonuses in a row to get a Nemesis Ribbon.** This ribbon shows that where you go

You will obtain a Nemesis Streak Bonus on the fifth time you kill some poor guy without him killing you back. You’ll then earn a Nemesis Streak Bonus for every kill you make on the poor sap if he still can’t get you back. There are therefore two options to earn a ribbon (which is why it’s been a source of endless confusion; goddamn).

**Option I**

You get the ribbon after killing a player 6 times in a row

Kill 5 = first Nemesis Streak Bonus. 

Kill 6 = second Nemesis Streak Bonus = Nemesis Ribbon. 

See it happen in this video: (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWMkef67c2I). It's a terrible video

You’ll get a new ribbon each time you kill that player twice more, etc., until the round ends or they finally get you, eyes red with tears.

You can be shot dead in between those kills as many times as necessary but not by the hand of your nemesis victim. If they kill you

**Option II**

Double the amount of hurt feelings by killing two guys

5th kill on poor sap #1 = 1 Nemesis Streak Bonus.

5th kill on poor sap #2 = 1 Nemesis Streak Bonus.

2 Nemesis Streak Bonus = 1 Nemesis Ribbon and a proud Momma.

And on and on if you’re really mean

Let me know if I got it right

In addition to the servers above, or discuss anything else on their mind. We also have a leaderboard to compare stats and improve our gameplay, a platoon event calendar to coordinate events, and a member map to show where everyone is located!

**Regular Events**

This week was particularly busy, I'm sure you'll find something you like. 

Our next planned event is the upcoming Ultracore Squad Rush tournament for squads of 4 to compete for the title. If you haven't played Ultracore Squad Rush

**Looking for Scrims**

We are actively looking for other PS3 communities to hold regular or one-time scrimmages for a little casual fun or friendly competition. We currently have an upcoming battle this weekend against the formidible JERB crew

**Still curious?**

Feel free to send [our platoon leaders a message](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fps3bf3voip

What was the best way you found to make friends? Did you use the regional platoons at all? Did you hop on teamspeak? Did you check out our [players list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Atws_ujVnGoXdGRvbW5LT0o1MzE2Vkx6VVg0Ql8wWFE)?

Use your imagination.  The US Marines are deployed onto Wake Island.  The objective, casting shadows off the nearby buildings.  A hostile runs by and I line him up in my 4x scope and squeeze the trigger.  It only takes a couple rounds and he is down.  I hesitate for a second as I wait to see if he was alone or if there are others.  Area seems clear so I advance on the objective. 

As I slowly capture the objective, his third pass will surely finish me off.  I see him turning around in the distance. He is flying low and straight at me, he won't miss a single shot this time.  I switch to thermal imaging to get a better sighting of my target.  I carefully aim above him and as he gets closer I wait for him to fly into my crosshairs.  Boom! I fire at the helicopter and send a tank shell straight through his windshield.  Enemy killed.  The helicopter flies right over my tank and explodes on impact.

Just as I thought the coast was clear I noticed that during all the excitement, the objective has been captured and my reinforcements have arrived.  I drive off in my tank leaving a trail of dust behind as I head to the next objective to do it all over again.

So search for:

PS3BF3 - CAN/USA East - Normal - Conquest &amp;amp;amp; Rush BF3&amp;amp;amp;B2K 

It's a good rotation between bf3 and b2k maps. 200% tickets. 

I think it would be fun to have a few different events once in a while. I'm thinking 500% tickets on caspian. Epic battles that last a long time. Get proper squads together to have super organized games. 

I got it for 7 days to see how it goes. I noticed that we didnt have any fully normal conquest servers up. So I figured this would be a welcome addition to our current fleet of servers.

* Join BattleLog and then Join the Platoon for your Region (see list in sidebar)

* Start PSN friending others in your Region - Friend your Platoon Leaders first. Then friend others in your Region.

rdt clan is WAY too big for people to try to friend everyone.  Please limit your efforts to your Region only.  Those Players who continue to join multiple Regions will find themselves booted soon.  They can rejoin

*You will probably want to download teamspeak3 for your computer or phone. More info on that in a day or two.*

**On Wednesday**; 

* check the post for your regions time and timezone in here OR check posts in BattleLog

* Join your Region's Leaders at the designated time by going to the Multiplayer Menu, and press 'x' to join them.

* Anyone who is a squad leader (you'll have a star next to your ID in the HUD) needs to change the squad to 'public'.  The default is 'private' which doesn't help us to gather together.

**RULES**

YOU MUST READ THE RULES FOR THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT BACON BATTLE TO JOIN IN.

For this first match, EOD BOTS for the first hour** unless you are trying to take out a vehicle in which case you can use whatever you need to kill a vehicle.  Figure out how to squad up.  You can change squads if you land with non-rdt's.  After the first hour, go all weapons and work on talking to the people in your squad about where enemies are and how you should be taking flags.

If your Region's game is full

knifing is more difficult and more fun that most people think.  If we do manage to get mostly full games of rdt clan

This week we saw a lot of action on our regular servers

The best of them all was probably our Ultracore Squad Rush event. For those of you who have never played Squad Rush, it was probably the most fun I've personally had playing BF3 in a long time.

Huge thanks to andersonic for hosting and planning the event. There will be many more events like this in the near future.

**Resources**

We currently use three servers for events and general play

* ***Hardcore (US):*** [Smokey Herbs 420 (Epic Battles)](http://bf3stats.com/server/ps3_7e8d827d-a43f-49d8-be70-2580265bc1e8) (foss333)

My team quickly captures every flag but B and I am en route with one of my squadmates.  As I drive over there, my squadmate, just disappears.  Again, dont recall.   So as I am about to respawn

At this point I am finally realizing that something douchey is going on, we were down like 240-140 tickets.  But with a team back behind us, me and my new squadmate (I hope you're out there somewhere) continue our epic under dog comeback and soon have the game back close, then tied and then finally back on top!

To participate, platoon name and intended clan tag using the form below, prior to 11:59 pm EST on 28 January 12.  For the purposes of this contest, players may only join one participating platoon.

Squads will play BF3, have a good time, and submit one image/screenshot of their single highest score attained during a single match. This should be screenshot of the final scoreboard of a match or screencaps of the battlelog of that match from their battlelog (keep in mind battlelog only saves the last 15 so take the screencap soon after the match ends just to be sure) or both. The squad with the single highest squad score in a single match will win.  Some sort of time stamp demonstrating when the photo was taken should be present in the screencap (holding a phone with date/time showing in the photo you take or other cretinous means of verification is acceptable).

**The rules** (simple as hell folks)

At least 2 registered squad members must be playing in the squad for the high score to qualify. This is limited to a minimum of 2 because timings and life things can make it difficult to get together.

While squadding up and playing within your own platoon is highly encouraged

Platoons should identify themselves using their clan tag at all times so opposing players who may drop in know they are playing with their competition.

A player is a winner if their squad obtains the highest submitted score. This will be the case even if they were not present at the time the winning score was achieved.

In cases of only 2 registered squad members present when a high score that is being submitted was captured

Squads will have a bit over 2 weeks to play and record their high scores

Any mode can be played however honest play without boosting is a must.

High scores must be submitted no later than 11:59 pm on 13 February 12 by screencaps uploaded to imgur.com. Links to the screencaps are to be sent by PM to reddit username nerdigurumi. Platoons should wait until they have reached their absolute highest score and only submit their very highest but if there is a case of premature submission

Example scenario clarification for anyone confused about squad composition:

Alpha

Pudge

A winning score is submitted for Platoon A where Alpha and Squint played with a random player and Eazeu. That means that Platoon A (Alpha

1327046240.0,oome3,Hi guys! Please take a look here - some interesting information regarding those of us who play together needs to be announced. And I think an innocent bystander is the best way to do it without any drama. ,dmanwithnoname,27,7,92,"Soundnerd has stepped down as mod here. I don't really understand the state of rdtclan at this time but he owns those subs. He has asked that we no longer associate ourselves with it. He has decided to completly close rdtclanhq which is where the region leaders meet to set up events and rules. 

Regardless of everything - us playing together will not change! Before someone comes and tries to create ANOTHER gaming group to spread us out even more I propose the following:

* Events for us playing together should be posted here in r/ps3bf3. We already do this anyway.

* Region clans should stay together. I think this is the best idea to come out of rdtclan. If you want to take your region and go make r/rdtregion so that you can talk about events and strategy  AWESOME. rdt west already did so. But we should still keep posting events and news here! R/ps3bf3 should remain our core. 

* I have put a lot of time into rdtclan and a bit peeved that everyone had to be so whiny about everything.  Edited: deleted information that really doesn't matter. 

* Mods I hope this isn't a problem. You guys haven't said anything about us posting rdtclan events in here before so us just posting normal events shouldn't make any difference. 

* PLEASE DO NOT MAKE ANOTHER GAMING GROUP. It's hard enough to find people to play with already. I will not be leaving the shelter of ps3bf3 until r/ps3bf4 is up and thriving. hmmmmm.... brb. ok i didn't want some karma whore going and making it so this one is donated to r/ps3bf3. 

That is all. ~~Maybe edits~~. I dunno. Go back to playing. 

EDIT: I am no longer able to access r/rdtclanhq. If you were a part of it and didn't see the post please message me. 

EDIT EDIT: I don't think we should have to change our region clan tags. Instead of rdt we are rdtregion. Our tags already strike fear in the heart of our opponents and fuck you I ain't changing it. 


Edit Edt edit: clarified what I meant about creating your own sub.



**EDIT maybe one last time:** If you can't read every comment here (there's a lot of discussion going on in the comments) you should at least check out [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/oome3/hi_guys_please_take_a_look_here_some_interesting/c3iwaa3?context=3) and [this one](http://www.reddit.com/r/ps3bf3/comments/oome3/hi_guys_please_take_a_look_here_some_interesting/c3itlu9).

[Smoke 'n Knives - Operation Metro TDM - Knife, or whether revives were ok(also legit).  If you've never set up this game, try it, it was a great icebreaker.

[Fraglight mode - Scrapmetal DOM Auto shotgun with frag rounds

[Battlefield 1861 - Caspian Border TDM - Bolt-action rifle with no attachments, it's basically straight up bolt action, ie. no straight pull or other gadgets including spawn beacons or sensors.  It's supposed to be 1861, so to see people setting motion sensors or parachuting in was a little out of place, but for future reference, these are a nono.  A great setup though, we all had a blast

[Torch 'n Paddles - Donya Fortress DOM](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59389258/4/307405213/) - Repair tool, and the paddle people were doing most of the reviving.  So hard to concentrate on capping flags, but so fun!

[Scope with it - Operation Firestorm TDM - .44 Scoped](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59390391/4/307405213/). So fun!  A wide open match with a close quarters weapon.  A very close match, and beacons/sensors seem to be allowed, so it made the strategy side a little more interesting.

[Elton John mode - Operation 925 DOM - SMAW, medpacks, and other gadgets were allowed except for MAVs and TUGS, as far as we could see.  Unfortunately, a lot of people crashed out of the server at this point and for many of us this was the end of the evening.  Still, a great night.

[Litter Bugs - Grand Bazaar TDM](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59402532/4/331578563/) - No restrictions

[Resident Evil - Ziba Tower DOM](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/battlereport/show/59403285/4/331578563/) - Shotgun (iron sights, laser), pistol. You cannot move and shoot or ADS.

If you're not familiar with TeamSpeak then check out the [Info Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1sxEWQG5iAoSo4fdT2npUaXMyBzxq9y5eBKGdMTZ6kdE).

For my current set up I use the [Sony Wireless Stero Headset](http://store.sony.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?catalogId=10551&amp;storeId=10151&amp;langId=-1&amp;partNumber=PS398085) and connect them to my computer for TeamSpeak (with my PS3 audio running to my computer). Pretty standard TeamSpeak set up that I think others may have as well. The problem was how to use this and VOIP at the same time. It's simple actually

What I bought:

* [USB External Soundcard Adapter](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0027EMHM6/ref=s9_simh_gw_p147_d1_i2?pf_rd_m=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;pf_rd_s=center-2&amp;pf_rd_r=0Y93YWTYGG1EX5999YZY&amp;pf_rd_t=101&amp;pf_rd_p=470938631&amp;pf_rd_i=507846)
* [3.5 mm clip on mic](http://www.amazon.com/3-5mm-Hands-Computer-Lapel-Microphone/dp/B005DJNRQM/ref=pd_ybh_15)

The whole thing costs about $6 

Just plug them all together and plug the USB into your PS3. Go to your mic settings and make sure the USB device is selected as your mic input. Now it's possible to use that mic for VOIP while still using the existing headset I already have for TeamSpeak. 

I use the clip-on to mount it to my Sony headset [like this](http://i.imgur.com/EWL3v.jpg) so that both mics are right by each other. The USB adapter also has a mic mute button so I can always have this set up and choose when to turn my VOIP on or off.

I like being a sniper in this game. It can bring a overwhelming sense of satisfaction if you help your team by placing well placed shots that kill the enemy and save your team mates.  The nicest thing about being a sniper is that on hardcore 1 hit kills with the bolt actions make you a force to be reckoned with. You can literally save a squad from getting wiped out with that one perfect shot on to a target killin' him before he kills your team mates. If you have a good hide you can be a one man defense on you Flag or M-Comm. I digress though.

As I was saying Actions are loudest thing in this game. I love saving team mates or reviving team mates. Kills are nice

This game is nice when a guy or gal just kills tango's left and right

But just wanted to ask around if people think the game is worth buying now for someone like me who hasn't played any Battlefield games before.

Is the learning curve steep? Do a lot of people still play? Is it easy to find a game? Does it run well on the PS3? Is the game rewarding? How long can I expect to play multiplayer before it becomes a ghost town?

I'd love to hear input from anyone.

I have been working with Nismo210 to develop some fun ideas for a tournament that everyone here can participate in. We have come up with two events that we think will be fun. Both events will be focused on vehicles and teamwork!

---

**THE FIRST EVENT**

*RHIB BOAT CHALLENGE*

    Rules:
   * Teams of 2. One driver and one gunner
   * Cannot get out of boat
   * Gunner can use boat gun or RPG/SMAW only
   * Driver cannot switch seats unless gunner dies
   * Gunner cannot drive unless driver dies
   * Repairs/health/ammo are fine 
   * First team to have both players die loses round (no respawning)
   * After each round
   * After 3 rounds
   
This event will take place on an unranked server on Kharg Island. Settings will be custom with normal settings except for no minimap and no 3D spotting. Events will be moderated so that there are no disputes about winners. Exact times of events will be determined when we know how many people are participating. We should be able to figure out a way so that everyone can participate. We may have a few match times for people in various timezones. A tournament bracket will be set up and a winning team will be determined elimination style (winning teams will face off until only 1 team remains).


---

**THE SECOND EVENT**

Will be announced in the future near the end of the RHIB Boat challenge. Stay tuned ;)

**WHAT DO YOU GET FOR WINNING?**

FLAIR! Glorious flair! Similar to the one you see next to my name

Apply to [the platoon](http://battlelog.battlefield.com/bf3/platoon/2832655241491718048/) and follow the instructions there.

We're eager to test our mettle on the new game modes and maps. Join us!

As always, and on June 15th we'll be making adjustments to our rosters to make room for active players. In the mean time, please apply and request access to our subreddit to become a member. A slot will be made available for you once we've made the roster adjustments.

We have a few simple rules:

1. PTFO
2. No spawn camping/base raping
3. Have fun
4. PTFO
5. When in doubt
We're always looking for friendly people that like to work together towards a common objective.

As many of you know


**What we are looking for**

We need mods for a few different reasons. There are the obvious mod duties such as going through the spam folder and watching out for inappropriate content. We also need some good CSS wizards that can make the sub look nice and create a nice sidebar and wiki. I feel it is also important to have mods that are active in the community. For this reason I wanted to ask for users already involved in this community that I know will do a good job getting players involved in the game. It is my hope that some of the new mods will be able to help create official events

You don't have to meet all these requirements to apply. If you just want to help in one area then let me know. You can either reply here or send me a PM if you have any personal concerns. Also if anyone knows of someone that is a god at coding but isn't involved here

once we moved over to bf3 things changed dramatically.  at this point most of the older guys had moved on.  there seemed to be a lot more unwarranted shit talking.  some of it was pointed at me and i'm not really sure why.  

i think we just have a new guard that seems unwilling to conform to the values we used to carry.  i'm obviously not directing this at everyone, without any sort of context, can only be taken as offensive.  

that being said, unfiltered racism.  the ""n"" word was uttered more than just a couple of times and it wasn't always in a playing manner (not that it should matter).

i'm not here to throw anyone under the bus

do we need to talk like that while we're playing together?  and what does it say about our community that it was being said on our teamspeak channels?  i'm sure that not everyone in this community is ok with that kind of language.  what if new people were to join our teamspeak channels in hopes of finding a welcoming community and instead found racists?  i for one would not be ok with that.

The hunter who kills snake

At the far end of Heavy Metal was a warehousey type building that I imagined could either contain someone to kill FTW(maybe if Snake gets there all Hunters put down there weapons and converge on the building where Snake takes on the Final Hunter--The Big Boss?? in a knife fight) or just have it as the end point.

I noticed something yesterday that I wanted to share.  In the server browser, however let me give some examples as to why I think the EA servers are crap.

First, The labels of kit specializations on squad-mates (like ""SPRNT"" or ""FLAK"") appear on the respawn screen.  This isn't something that I have seen on every DICE server, but it is there on most.  Lastly, the game doesn't jump around as much.

Please also understand that rdt clan and r/ps3bf3 are not the same.  rdt clan has several Reddits and several games we are dedicated to.  We like to think of it as *assisting* Game Reddits.

* enter your info in the player list [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dE5LNXllZkl3U0drb1czSGlvUi1fQ3c6MQ)

* join the Platoon for your region - DO NOT join more than one rdt clan platoon

* PSN friend everyone in your region

* Be BRAVE!!! Join these new friends (FELLOW REDDITORS mind you so they are all cool people like you) when you play Battlefield 3.  You should also invite these new friends into your games/squad.

* For now you will battle WITH each other and if your Platoon Leader (we sometimes call them Region Group Leaders or RGLs) is up for it

* In about three weeks

------

**Next week should be the start of two other rdt clan events.**

* I host what I call 'soundnerd's Wednesday Night Bacon Battles' - sometimes I even set up special challenges where you can win Bacon.  There is a link in the bottom of the sidebar where you can suggest types of Battles and vote on them.

* PeZoAm0 hosts Friday night's Wrecked Reddit - the point is to play trashed and just have fun.  This is EPIC shit and always freakin hilarious.

Please do not ask us to change event details after we post about them.  You can PM us if you have requests.

These will be added to the [**rdt clan calendar of events**](https://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=7ro2cbrtoq9kvhc5n818r7iqj0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/New_York) which is also listed in the sidebar.

9 months ago we organised a AUS vs NZ scrim.

Please let me know if you are keen to play for either AUS or NZ

 Also please suggest what maps and game modes you are keen to play as everything below is really just a template until we figure out what works best for everyone. Suggest maps/modes by writing a comment with your suggestion and nothing else (eg


We will play **1** warm up round, playing each rush map twice to give everyone a fair go at attacking/defending. I would love to play more but I'm not sure if everyone will have time as this could take between 1-2 hours.

I'm also hoping we can have a practice round the Sunday with whoever is available.  

So far I am planning it for **SUNDAY APRIL 7TH 2013. 12pm Perth GMT +8. 3pm Sydney. 5pm NZ. ** (please let me know if this time/date does/doesn't work for you.)

Currently it is named **rokk's** server if you wish to play. Rokks will most likely use Battlelogs Match feature to help sort teams/create certain access to players

*I edited that last part. See rokkuranx comment below.

**What tactics did we employ?**

* We really just got ourselves situated in the Tehran Highway game. It was our first ""practice."" We specifically tailored squads to 3 instead of 4. This gave us a squad per conquest flag and 2 squads on each MCOM. It made much more sense to do this. In the event of a spawn camp, spawn on the other leader, then move back to their squad. This never happened in-game, but was part of the 3-man squad design.
* Weapon loadouts were kept similar. Everyone in the squad ran the same perk regardless of class. This avoided a need to change loadouts altogether and keep us in the game quicker. This was done in the practice round.
* Vehicle loadouts were kept different. We did this in order to maximize the perks available in vehicles. If one is running reactive armor
* Air superiority was not emphasized much. We didn't know how things would role out, we shut down usage of them altogether.

That's pretty much it. We didn't have many tactics for rush other than smoke and coordinated attacks. Team deathmatch involved no tactics other than communication. Revives were a priority.

**Tactics that didn't work for VOIP**

* Mortaring was just not a good plan. Having assault players running smoke or regular 320 would do the same amount of good. 
* MAV usage was too much. I think I saw 3-4 MAVs up in the air at a time sometimes and that just takes all those guys out of the game. One is more than enough.
* C4 on the MCOMS is not a bad idea and usually good for one or two kills/defends

When you arrive at a capture point and begin to wind the counter down you will hear a chime equivalent to what I imagine the flag sounds like when its coming down the metal pole. You will ONLY hear this chime if no enemy players are in the area you are capturing.

For instance

In contrast if the same two people head to capture ""A"" and arrive but there is a camper hidden on the flag, there is at least one combatant currently contesting the area you are capturing.

I hope this helps!!
