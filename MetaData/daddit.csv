Mom used to call them up and tell them she couldn't visit because I wouldn't let her. The truth was the judge told her she had to get off coke

It's a long story but the short version is that my kids for years thought that I was keeping their mother from them, were frustrated and angry. I didn't bad mouth their mom, I'd just say she's having a hard time right now but she loves them.


My oldest daughter moved out a while ago

The gist:

&gt; Dad

This was coming from my prodigal daughter who was just so upset that her mom left that she used me as her ""punching bag"" for years. Years of everything you don't want to happen happening. I took it all and always tried my best to stand strong

I had forgotten the idea of being appreciated

I woke up and I grabbed my son's hand and said hey buddy daddy missed you and as soon as he heard my voice he looked at me and smiled. I could just tell they were both so happy to see me and even half asleep my heart melted. It sound supper sappy but I seriously have never felt more loved in my entire life then I did at that moment. I finally understand what people mean when they say stuff like that makes all the hardships worth it. Sorry to get all emotional but I can't think of anyone who I could share that with.,t5_2rxue,True

My wife was having an affair when she got pregnant. She admitted she didn't know whose it was

The child is now almost a year old and her mother decided that she looks like the other man. He's still dating her

I'm conflicted. I loved being a father, and they've been talking about buying a home together. This is a chance for the child to have a single-family home. I feel like it would be selfish of me to try to stay in her life. A friend recommended that I make sure the court knows that if I'm ever needed I'll be there for her, but as long as her parents are both active in her life I'm willing to relinquish my parental rights for the child's benefit.

I'm heart-broken by this. I was looking forward to celebrating her first birthday this week, and sharing the rest of her life. Now I feel like it's all been a strange dream. I've grown through this experience, and I'll never be the same. I don't want to not be a dad anymore, but I've learned to roll with the punches life throws at you. A friend told me ""you'll always be a dad, if someone's child dies that doesn't make them less of a dad."" That meant a lot, but in my heart I'm not convinced. I feel like I've been living a lie.

I'm not really looking for specific advice, and what we're doing for her birthday. I'll have to tell them soon, but I'm trying to wait until the court makes a decision next week.

My wife and I had been trying for a kid since we were married. Failed a few times due to misreading her cycles. Finally we succeeded last year.. only for her to miscarry at 6 weeks. She was hurting for awhile until, set us up for ultrasounds, the whole shebang. He said not to get our hopes up high because it was so rare to hear of a successful pregnancy so close to a miscarriage. But the weeks (and months) went on and everything pointed to a healthy baby girl. 

Around the halfway point we started working on looking for baby-friendly apartments, so the initial shock wore off and now everybody was in baby mode. Even my own mother, who is always adamant (read: a total bitch) about how we're not financially stable enough to have a kid, had come to terms with being a grandma in a few months. At the 21st week, we went to have an ultrasound and blood work done to test for Down Syndrome and a few other prenatal tests. The techs and doc laughed with us constantly that little Harley was healthy as can be, and she jumped around like a jumping bean every time somebody pressed on my wife's belly with equipment.

That following Sunday she noticed some red spotting. Of course it had to be Sunday, did a quick sonogram and put an IV on her. Harley was fine, so I assumed it was just a false alarm; maybe she strained a little too much at the gym or maybe she was just seeing some old blood that was finally flushed out. The on-call doc finally arrived, took one look at everything the nurses had done, took a look at my wife's canal, and told us she was dilated. There was no reason why, no explanation he could possibly come up with. ""Sometimes you have a bad cervix and you don't catch it until it's too late."" (I'm paraphrasing because the shock had already taken over. But that's the gist of what I heard. We had a happy healthy baby girl jumping around,"" said the doctor

IT IT fucking IT! ""SHE is my baby girl!"" I wanted to scream. ""We have pictures where the ultrasound tech typed IT'S A GIRL! in all caps framed in my in-laws living room! You'd be delivering my little girl and there's nothing you can do!?!"" What came out was ""s-so can't you just sew up her cervix? Keep it from dilating any further?"" I became a little kid who doesn't understand medical jargon. ""You're a doctor

He had my wife moved to a delivery room and told her to just let it come naturally. I had sped her to the hospital ~9:00 that morning. Sometime around 6 that evening, because we agreed that might have clouded our judgement if the nurses would have wanted to try to keep her on a resuscitator. But that initial pain I felt got worse: she was just a healthy baby a little bit ago, but she wasn't a viable baby when she'd come out? If this would've just waited a few more weeks she might have survived? Nothing made sense. Since they were changing shifts, the night nurse was informed of our situation and came in to clean Harley, put her in some clothes they made specifically for pre-term babies, took a bunch of pictures and tended to everything my wife needed. I never in a million years thought I'd be okay with holding a dead child, but there I was. The nurse even took a picture of that, but I guess I'm glad she was there to chronicle things

We had a funeral. My wife's aunt used to work for a local funeral home so she bent a few guys' fingers to give us a deal on a tiny casket and service. She also worked with them to put Harley at the feet of my wife's grandmother's grave. I was fine with that. I never met my grandma-in-law but I heard she was awesome and would have laughed her ass off at having a great-grandkid named after comic books. The tight group of family we have showed up. My wife has a few aunts and uncles who all live in the same neighborhood so it's always easy to get the whole family together. My parents have been divorced for 11 years but they were able to be civil long enough to cry with us. An aunt I really hate showed up but this wasn't the time to shit on her. That was it. No friends came. No neighbors. No other well-wishers or people we were so sure would take an hour out of their Friday. The funeral procession looked like a group of tourists looking for a McDonald's.

So here we are now. My wife just went back to work. I lost my job because I took so much time off from the grief. She's having anxiety attacks so her doc suggested anti-depressants. She clings to me every second, the next she's angry and calling herself a horrible person because ""her body is all screwed up and fucked us out of a baby."" I'm here all day for her, at least until I can find another job (which seems impossible in this fucking redneck town I'm in). But I'm not all there. I stumble upon little things that just bring that pain in my heart right back and into a lump in my throat. The bills are stacking up. Neither of us had vacation time or bereavement time so all that time we took off was unpaid. The funeral was less than I had anticipated but still drained us. The only help we could get was from my in-laws, who cooked meals and bought us groceries for the proceeding weeks after our hospital stay; and my mother owns the house we live in so the rent hasn't had to be on time. But it's hard to explain to the electric company or the phone company ""I can't pay you for the month because I lost a baby at 21 weeks and refuse to get over it so my wife and I didn't go to work and cried like little bitches for 3 weeks and rather than let the hospital take care of her we just HAD to pay for a funeral so have some sympathy!"" etc. I'm just not sure where to go from here.

I don't know what to call this. I'm sorry it's so long and disjointed. There are support groups the nurses told my wife she can attend if she decides not to start the anti-depressants. But I don't have the luxury of that or a therapist or even a doctor (my wife has insurance but I don't). She left for work pissed at me because I'm so upset over our finances. Besides Harley

After a long weekend and long day where I watched the kid and then hung doors when my mother in law got to our house. Then watched him again and finally wife and mother in law wanted to watch some chick shows. I ask for some alone time. I go to my computer room and sit down and next thing I get is, no poop). 2 minutes later i hear, ""i think the dogs want to go out."" and at that point I had had it.I'm walking out of the computer room ready to tell my mother in law off when i hear, ""Babe the dogs don't need to go out."" And then ""Don't you ever tell my husband to do something again. Seriously, he busted his ass all day and you always nag him to do shit whenever he asks for his time. You don't get to tell him what to do.""

Very pleased is all I can say. Anyone have similar stories?

Edit: I should clarify the wrong way. The wrong way is when my mother in law is being a nag and I complain to my wife that what she said bothered me. Then my wife later just sucker punches her mother saying , and this verbal K.O. pretty much throws her into a mini-depression fixed by shopping therapy (like cases of diapers). This is opposed to confronting her mother in front of me or backing me up when I say something to my mother in law (which I do) is so much more constructive and effective.",,False,self,t5_2rxue,1361296887.0,,

My wife was rushed to an operating room where an emergency C-Section occurred. Our baby Amelia was born with no breath or heartbeat. After 15 minutes of CPR the doctors were able to resucitate her. She was then rushed to the NICU while my wife was sewn adn stapled up (my wife had been put under). I was out in the waiting room, stabalize her vitals, and allows her brain (which was suspected of taking an insult) to receive the nutrients it needs instead of the other organs using up those nutrients.

Problem was that our hospital did not have the equipment needed to do the hypothermia treatment. So Amelia was airlifted to the larger hospital where she was started on the cooling treatment. In the meantime

After some convincing, morphine to assist in sedating her (and pain relief), ventilator, blood pressure meds, catheter, sugars, and some other stuff I don't understand yet.

Amelia has underwent several heart echos and ultrasounds. Her belly was hard and that worried the NICU staff. Amelia was given glycerine to help flush a huge amount of stools that her bowels could not void due to the cooling treatment. (Bowels were not working). Amelia then started pooping out everything making her belly hard so that's great!

Yesterday the catheter, and blood pressure meds were removed since assessments showed progress. Her body is finally stable but the big question now is whether she had any brain damage. Last night the 72 hours of cooling ended and she was warmed over 12 hrs to normal temps. She then had more tests and scans, including an MRI. The neurology team is reviewing the results today and we hope to hear some reports over the next day or so as to whether there is any brain damage that was detectable. 

We love this little baby girl so much. We are so afraid for her and we want her to have a happy life

My pics of her are on my iPod so I will post again in the comments if I can figure out how. 


Edit: dec 6 hi everyone I promise to come back here to update. No wifi at hospital making it hard

Edit 2: 
my wife and I met with the neurologist last night. He gave us the news straight. The EEG did not show seizure activity but did show signs of a brain injury. Then he talked about the MRI results and said that Amelia's brain showed injuries on the left and right sides, deep into the brain. The results are expected to be severe. The likely outcome is called cerebral palsy which is the name of a spectrum of disorders that can range from a twitching finger all the way to wheelchair bound gross motor problems. I haven't learned much about it yet. The guy also said the part of the brain the controls vision was injured so Amelia will likely have vision loss or blindness. 

The actual extent of the disabilities won't be determined until Amelia starts to show symptoms or indications of her actual capabilities or in capabilities. 

My wife and I are quite broken up about this. We were up all night crying. Our 2 year boy is confused at our behaviour. We keep being told that there was nothing we could have done to prevent this but my wife feels overloaded with guilt at not knowing sooner that there was a problem. 

We are just afraid that our baby girl will have problems that will restrict or reduce her happiness. We want to provide her with the best life and he beer chance we can. She breastfed for the first time yesterday so that is a good sign. I am so tired I have to take a break from writing now. I read all your comments and really appreciate what you have all said l. I can't answer you all individually but I will read each comment. I will bring more updates as possible and when I have Time and energy I will put up more pics. She is so beautiful. We love her much.

Another edit: dec 6 around noon now. NICU called and said Amelia was physically well enough to ambulance her back to our home city's NICU. She has already left and we are trying to pack our stuff to follow her towards home. 

More edit: dec 9 baby Amelia is doing well

Update Dec 14: Amelia was discharged from the NICU two nights ago. We are happy to have her home and happy to not be visiting the hospital so much. We have learned how to administer Amelia's seizure meds. We are doing exercises and stretches with Amelia's various joints to prevent stiffness and to improve range of motion and muscle tone. It's going to be a long and constant treatment process but it will be worth it I'm sure. We are doing all we can to maximize her potential. I am also grateful for healthcare system in Canada because the only cost to us for the whole thing has been food and fuel while we were on the road. The estimated actual cost of the medical care received to date tops a million USD (which includes the airlift and everything else).",self,t5_2rxue,1355542619.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/daddit/comments/14c03n/meet_amelia_died_at_birth_brought_back_to_life/

Yesterday my wife and I were out with the kids, almost no kids there.  A little strange...but then I see why.  THIS Santa was only for people who were buying $40 or $50 dollar picture packages.

It's been a rough year financially.  We don't have the money for the picture packages but...it's Santa.  Santa.  The big red man himself.  Our kids, starts to tear up and tugs them along.  My heart is broken, her heart is broken, the kids are upset.

I just can't pull in the money we need, and we're struggling to meet bills, and none of my clients are paying what they're supposed to when they're supposed to, and now my kids don't get to see Santa because someone thought it was a great idea to only make him available to the parents with the additional funds to foot the bill...

""Hey hun, please...""

The family steps into a little store to look around

There's a look to the big red man

""You can take a picture on your phone

Bystander to the rescue.  An iphone is produced by a lady who overheard the whole thing.  The kids climb on Santa's lap, rubs their hair, tells them to be good for us, to go to bed on time.

My wife and I are both crying a little

As we walk off

You see, and when she called, complaining of excruciating back pain, I left work right away, called our midwife.

We waited another twenty minutes before deciding she was in too much pain, my wife utters the words 
""I see her head, where we find my wife, holding a screaming beet red little baby.

The act of blowing bubbles requires the blower to take in a deep breath, his tantrums became pretty manageable----just let him take a few deeps breaths with the bubbles. 

It's like a baby-hack.  You force them to slow their pulse and heart rate down with breath control.  And, which distracts the mind.  He has gotten very good at blowing them.

That's how I realized that I shouldn't be trying to be Mom, the more you will enjoy it. The more you enjoy it, the happier it will make them.  This is because instead of trying to get the activity right you will be trying to have fun with them.

Put the kids to sleep in their clothes for tomorrow. Pajamas are overrated, dress them in tomorrow's wear and you've cut a good 30 minutes off your morning prep.   

Frozen pepperoni, that is what my kids prefer as their snack to take to school. 

A pressure cooker is your friend. You can throw everything you have in your fridge into the pressure cooker and 30 minutes later you've got something tasty. Way better and cheaper than fast food. 

If your kids won't eat vegetables then throw the veggies in the pressure cooker with a little moisture

If you don't want your kids to cuss to much in public, never realizing that there is never a bad time to say ""fuck"".  

Join the PTA

When you know your kids are listening, and they will have an expectation to live up to.  

Expose them to new shit all the time

Give your kids a sense of humor. I have often seen fathers who, but around their kids try and maintain a stern, strict demeanor (I may be overestimating the frequency of this, but it is definitely a thing, guys who were raised by a strict father who don't joke around with their kids, even though they are hilarious when with their friends). Fart jokes never get old, also, they will be the most popular kid in their school. Don't let them make jokes about you dying though

Demonstrate affection. Even if you never get it anymore from your wife

Now, that's fine.  That's their won business, I don't care.  But, that being said, I don't want my daughter to be a stripper.  I just don't.  And I thought it was kind of offensive for someone to draw a correlation between my daughter being quirky and her becoming a stripper.

Later when we were leaving, ""Well this is just CP, I can't be associated with this,"" and put her down.  I might have lost it and laid into her a little bit.

I just can't sit back anymore

We're in our 30's (32/33). We'd have been trying for almost a year when we found out that my wife was finally expecting our first child.

About 2 weeks ago she started battling her typical fall allergies. This time, where she could barely eat and was always on the verge of vomitting. Her OB suggested that we go to the ER and get fluids in her along with some IV anti-nausea meds. So away we went. 

Come to Tuesday, and couldn't see anything. So he sent her to our hospital where they could use (I guess) a more powerful u.s.

There the Dr

I know it's only been a couple of days, she starts bawling and apologizing (like she thinks it's her fault).

Everything I see on TV or hear on the radio has been mentioning new borns or baby names or some other variant of babies. Even while in prep for the procedure the hospital played a lullaby over the PA (they do that to signify a new birth as do most hospitals).

I've been doing my best at being as strong as possible for her. At this point I want to revert back to my early 20's, have been fighting it.

As for the cause

Basically this is like MS

The neurologists actually say the pregnancy was protecting her and the end of the pregnancy and all the surging hormones caused these attacks to hit. The good news about the episodes not being classified as seizures is that she shouldn't lose her drivers license. In my state

We're not totally out of the woods

First post here

I'll try to keep it brief. Basically

This morning he saw something of interest on the top of the entertainment center that holds the TV and decided he wanted to climb up and see it. We have one of those last generation big tube 32"" TVs in the entertainment center. :(

Suffice it to say, but came out unscathed.

I know this may sound like horrible parenting

I just wanted to share this scary experience and remind all of you that it only takes a moment for something tragic to happen. Luckily our day moved forward with no problems

Please, and other safety measures like that. Just double check your surroundings when you can. I'd hate for this or something worse to happen to anyone else out there. 

Sorry for the chage in topic mood of this subreddit

The hugs and kisses from my son were more sweet than anything imaginable this morning.

We have a family history of very bad reactions to the pertussis vaccine. I ended up in the hospital as a child

Because of this. We're waiting for our little girls to get older before they receive the vaccine (so their body can handle it). My oldest daughter is 3

But thanks to the rising cases of pertussis here in WA state

**She'll be fine. We caught it in time and she's on antibiotics now. But still. It makes me very anxious, selfish, and irresponsible nature of other human beings.**

The whole concept of ""my children aren't vaccinated and they're perfectly healthy"" is so unbelievably irresponsible and selfish it actually blows my mind. My little girl isn't really strong enough to fight any of these diseases your children may be carrying. So that's why we need to vaccinate everyone. So no one can be exposed.

Maybe vaccines worked to well? I mean think about it

You pair that with media darlings and pseudo-science and you have a horrible comedy of errors.

Sorry for the probably ignorant rant

TL;DR: Fuck you Jenny McCarthy.

**EDIT: Thanks festering_fecolith! TIL that the whole cell DTP vaccine was what caused all my family members to be sick in the past

**EDIT2: After reading this CDC article: http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6128a1.htm -- it would seem that it's a more complex problem than my initial rant (shocking right?). Not only is there a rise of pertussis cases in Washington State,,False,self,t5_2rxue,1345581661.0,,True

The kid holds in his poop like I've never seen before. His tummy is distended, midwives, and others: change his diet, give him Miralax (or Senna), give him suppositories (saline or glycerin). The results of this are usually pretty rapid: he poops like a lumberjack for a couple days. We've cut out dairy, gone gluten-free, and given him gallons of prune juice.

Then he stops pooping again. I can only imagine that his anal retentiveness is due in large part to the horrid constipation followed by horrid diarrhea that has been the pattern for most of his life. I've tried to be a dad that praises farts, and pee. We love biological functions at our house! But none of it helps.

I'm at my wit's end. And tonight's traumatic experience was the apex of 2.5 years of really crappy experiences. I want my son to play and be happy and not hate pooping. I want him to have one freaking day where his tummy doesn't hurt.

At the end of the day Mom asked her ""So how does it feel to be 5?""

Tears welled up in her eyes as she responded ""I don't want to be 5

This seemed very strange as she had been very excited all day and in the preceding weeks about turning 5.  Mom asks

An unexpected response followed, then nana and papa keep getting older, then they are going to die and I will miss them.  I want to stay four forever.""

We both found this shocking.  What happened to our baby who's greatest life concern was the location of her favourite doll?  When did she start drawing these correlations between her passage of time and that of others?  Does she often think about the death of her elders?

I don't really have a question or anything...We've always been pretty open about death and the whole circle of life concept

She grew up a lot more than I anticipated this weekend.
