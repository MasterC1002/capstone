This is like going into /r/classicalmusic and posting Beethoven's 5th Symphony, and contributing nothing to the quality of this community. I think there's a time and a place for posting recordings like this (i.e. ""Just transcribed this classic solo - take a closer listen to what he's doing at 03:12!""

Edit: Thanks for all of your responses guys, and have new submissions reserved for lesser-known recordings (by classic artists, or modern artists), interesting articles, and pictures? Thanks again everyone. My apologies if I sounded like ""that guy"" or a jazz-douche, I just think a wider diversity would do our community some good. I also think just because you're new to jazz, doesn't mean you can't appreciate things other than the classics. Chris Potter does some awesome shit that's not anything like a standard, etc.

So maybe the user who posted one of the top 5 or so comments from the previous week's post would be picked at random (or by the previous week's chooser?)

I was also thinking of making a Google spreadsheet of all the albums so that we can keep track of what we talked about and to make sure to mix things up (old and new

My goal here is to share my **love** for jazz improvisation and to get others involved and **share** their talents with those of us watching around the globe.  

For the longest time I’ve wanted to “jam” with musicians using the Internet. I’m probably one of the older players on this sub-reddit

Despite this r/jazz of having over 20, and I want to hear everyone’s original compositions! 

I encourage those of you who play to come out of your shell and show us what you’ve got! Your contributions only enhance the quality of this subreddit when students and professionals alike can share their passion for music and for jazz instantaneously. 

**** **Don't be afraid to record yourself! Share with us your versions on soundcloud or youtube**

**REQUEST**: Downvotes are okay! It’s better than NO FEEDBACK

Here are some examples from jam sessions:

1:  We get at least one topic every few days along the lines of 'Hey, and we could do more to help them.  My suggestion is to create a comprehensive list by decade with brief descriptions to give new people not only something to listen to but context on what it is and why it's important.  I think a community-made playlist would be helpful as well for everyone, not just new folks.    
    
2:  Along those lines, etc.  It might be helpful to include in that a list of frequently-posted artists (from jazz greats like Miles and Coltrane to crossover hits like BADBADNOTGOOD and the Seatbelts) that explain what style of jazz they are and what else sounds like them.    
    
3:  Occasionally this subreddit will go through a 'phase' where one certain subgenre is really popular for a day or two.  I think we should celebrate those phases and perhaps do like they do in r/hiphopheads and have certain days of the week where posting a certain subgenre is encourage.  I think it's important that we not DISCOURAGE anything else on those days, we could take each Thursday to post great examples of music performed by jazz trios.  We could have like, Free Jazz Fridays or Big Band Sundays or Funky Mondays or whatever.  Suggestions are welcome and encouraged.  
    
4:  I think one of the best things we can do for this subreddit is foster more discussion.  Right now, but I also think there are a TON of good discussion ideas for jazz as a genre that we could talk about.  Here are some examples.    
If you could see any combination of performers play together
What stage of ________'s career was the best/most important?  When do you think they started to change their style
What are some of your favorite solos
Who played (name of standard) the best?    
What were some 'failed experiments' of jazz greats?  Why don't you think they worked?  Do you think they're underrated?    
Etc.
    
5:  It's a small thing
    
Edit: 6:  I think we should have a stricter policy on image posts.  We get a lot of pictures that are just a jazz guy doing jazz things that don't inspire much discussion beyond 'lol the look on his face'.  I'm not saying we should forbid picture posts altogether, or 'this is what _______ wrote about ________'.

**I know this list is very incomplete. My intention was to provide a sampler of the various flavors of jazz bass to the interested beginner. Feel free to add suggestions in the comments!**


**INTRODUCTION**
The history of jazz bass is one of liberation. The acoustic bass is a beast of an instrument: it's hard to make it sound good. Hell, providing the harmonic and rhythmic foundation on which the music is constructed. Over the decades, bass pioneers have expanded its scope: first, by refining technique; then, by shattering the boundaries of accompaniment and carving out a niche of artistic freedom for themselves. Now bass it's on the same level as any other instrument in jazz: here's a list of the trailblazers who, amongst many many others, have made it happen. Enjoy!

**JIMMY BLANTON**
In a time when bass was relegated to the very background of the jazz ensemble

1940: [Pitter Panther Patter](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8xJlV0Agi1w) duet with the Duke.

1940: [Cotton tail](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbOseBw-fnU) with the Duke Ellington orchestra.

**SLAM STEWART**
Killer swing and a distinctive solo style

1945: [I got rhythm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-0ypn2rWvFA) with Don Byas on saxophone.

1979: [Tangerine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI2QqJ2QlM8) with Hank Jones (p) and Peter Appleyard (v).

**RAY BROWN**
Fantastic walker. One of the swingingest cats around in the history of jazz. Plus

1950: [Improvised tune](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KeCmvnzcECQ) with Hank Jones (p) and Buddy Rich (d).

1961: [The man I love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wacjJiKqfjo) with the Oscar Peterson trio.

**CHARLES MINGUS**
Mingus was a world-class composer. But he wasn't a slouch on the bass either: incredible technique

1950: [Move](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77Pkkxp6JFM) with the Red Norvo trio.

1962: [Fleurette africaine](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vUHaSB1adI) with Duke Ellington (p) and Max Roach (d).

**OSCAR PETTIFORD**
Rock solid

1953: [Blues in the closet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWLo8xkOxDc); in this cut Oscar plays the cello.

1954: [Marcel The Furrier](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=syVQSN11LyY) with his sextet.

**PAUL CHAMBERS**
Huge

1956: [Dexterity](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qUCj199D378) with John Coltrane as sideman (!).

1958/59: [So what](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEHzs7Fknpw) with the Miles Davis quintet.

**SCOTT LA FARO**
Scott was one huge step ahead on the long and winding road of bass liberation. His comping was melodically sculpted and rhythmycally relentless. Awesome musicianship. 

1958: [Chart of my heart](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lN4CrJ9lyzE) with the Richie Kamuca quintet.

1961: [Alice in wonderland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuzZ8mV9Zh8) with the Bill Evans trio.

**JIMMY GARRISON**
One of the very best on the scene in the 1960s. He recorded extensively with Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane, intellectual in his approach; a tone as big as a mountain. One fine example of a very, very serious player for whom music mattered most.

1961: [Milestones](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6T28lWfb-7o)

1963: [After the rain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2faoL66ozw) with the John Coltrane quartet.

**REGGIE WORKMAN**
An old lion (still performing and teaching at 74). Played with Art Blakey, Lee Morgan and, more recently, with pianist Mal Waldron. His tone has a hard edge to it, with a strong percussive attack. 

1962: [Caravan](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eP12RhmBIRw) with Art Blakey's Jazz Messengers.

1975: [Amy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CiMT_yH31Uo) with bassoon player Makanda Ken McIntyre.

**RON CARTER**
THE master walker. He was instrumental  in establishing the greatness of the second Miles Davis quintet

1964: [Joshua](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o40smfOyIso) with the Miles Davis quintet.

1974: [117 Special](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7a5Ekloaqo) from his *All Blues* LP.

**NIELS-HENNING ØRSTED PEDERSEN**
If the bass world was Walhalla

1964: [Beautiful love](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TlPv0szwxVw) with the Bill Evans trio.

197?: [Move](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDtbz2KHmiI) with Joe Pass (g).

**CHARLIE HADEN**
He recorded Ornette Coleman's seminal LP, Gonzalo Rubalcaba, Pat Metheny, Richard Galliano, Hank Jones, Kenny Barron amongst others). His style is very subdued and melodic, yet extremely poignant.

1959: [Lonely woman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DNbD1JIH344) with Ornette Coleman.

2001: [Nocturnal](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XTeVod4eH5k) with pianist Gonzalo Rubalcaba.

**STANLEY CLARKE**
One of the very few bi bassists. Innovator on the electric

1977: [School days](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOaRG_1SDa4).

2010: [Black narcissus](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LM30TBrtO4) featuring Hiromi Uehara (p).

**JACO PASTORIUS**
This man needs no introduction

1978: [Birdland](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgTjKf5FK4k) with Weather Report

198?: [Donna Lee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?NR=1&amp;v=I4rfe5xHCIg) with his orchestra.

**DAVE HOLLAND**
Yet again a proof that Miles could choose his musicians. He replaced Ron Carter in the Miles Davis group in the late 60s

1973: [Conference of the birds](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8SQXLaNXvGA)

2003: [Mr. P.C.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHu6rzmUvFI)

**GARY PEACOCK**
He started working in the early sixties with West Coast giants like Art Pepper and Paul Bley, they form one of the best and most prolific trios since the 80s. 

1986: [Woody'n you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rcz4XLuafJg) with Keith Jarrett and John De Johnette.

1997: [Witchi Tai To](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_iaZESVRuo) with Ralph Towner (g).

**CHRISTIAN McBRIDE**
The epitome of the modern jazz bassist. Equally adept at both the electric and acoustic instrument, producer, pop session man, jazz virtuoso. The man has it all. 

2004: [James](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hkqLs3Dcbt4) with the Pat Metheny trio.

2009: [Cherokee](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_VhAcgthjY) with his trio.

I’ve tried to list the main players while giving mention to others who are related by either being influenced by

**Art Tatum**-Considered as ‘God’ within jazz dynasty. Extremely virtuosic and technical in his playing,chord, 5,chord, etc). Although he fell out of popularity with the advent of Bebop, He’s still idolized by today’s players as being one of the greatest pianists of all time and set the foundation and level for piano players onwards.

(See Also: James P Johnson, Jelly Roll Morton)

**Bud Powell**-One of the two leaders of Bebop piano. Bud came up out of the stride era of piano and ventured away from it by keeping his left hand sparse and simple while pushing the boundaries in his right hand soloing. Noted for his ability to play at fast tempos while keeping his time clean, Barry Harris, Phineas Newborn Jr.)

**Thelonious Monk**-The other leader of Bebop piano. Best known for his distinctive playing sound, Epistrophy, Bright Mississippi and many more). Beyond his playing, Monk is known for his strange demeanor and mannerisms on the stage, that being dancing and singing in the middle of songs when he wasn’t playing.

**Oscar Peterson**-The Maharaja of the keyboard, with hands that spanned a 10th at resting position, he was known for lines that flew up and down the keyboard with ease. Peterson adapted into the genres of jazz coming along while still holding true to the traditional sounds; exemplified in his ability to cut out the band and go to a high paced stride solo in the middle of songs. Peterson is one of the extreme few Jazz musicians who never fell into drug use during his tenure, which may have led to him having such a long career. During the mid-nineties Peterson suffered a stroke and was paralyzed in the left side of his body. He eventually made a recovery and returned to performing.

**Bill Evans**-One of the most influential piano players of the modern era of jazz. Came up in the scene during the 1950s and briefly played with Miles Davis’s band. Although he left to pursue his own projects, Evans made great use of Block Chord technique (created by Phil Moore, made popular by George Shearing); harmonizing the melody note in the right hand with a full chord underneath, usually with the melody doubled an octave down in the left hand. Evan’s then went on to work primarily on his own projects, mostly based around the piano trio (piano bass drums) setting.  Evans’ is credited greatly for progressing the dynamic of the piano trio, bringing out the bass and drums more for solos and interaction. Although his trio work is extensive, Evan’s has notable work in duo and solo projects, and Undercurrent with Jim Hall. Recommended listening: [Time Remembered, Lyle Mays

**McCoy Tyner**-Noted for his incredible energy and intensity at the piano, which led to him being able to later pursue his own projects with his trios and quartets. Tyner’s sound was a healthy mix between the new free and fusion sounds making their way into jazz and the hard bop that was already happening. Recommended Listening: [Confirmation,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xafJW_VtA8w) [Passion Dance,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q5e14Tng9Sk&amp;feature=related)

**Herbie Hancock**-Herbie started out playing as a sideman in the early sixties and eventually found himself playing in Miles’ Second Great Quintet. During this time he helped redefine the role of the rhythm section with Ron Carter and Tony Williams. While playing for Miles,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=udCbtl7YEf4) [Chameleon,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SQsSQRWMhOs) [Maiden Voyage,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hwmRQ0PBtXU) (See Also: George Duke, Joe Zawinul )

**Chick Corea**-Got the same starting as Herbie, Now He Sobs which became a very influential trio album (Roy Haynes, Miroslav Vitous). Corea went on to form Return to Forever, which focused on electric instrumentation and incorporated latin musical elements. Towards the later eighties Chick started a new group called The Elektric Band, and one moving back to traditional jazz sounds called the Akoustic band. Chick’s playing used many elements of McCoy Tyner’s sound including fourth voicing’s and pentatonic scales. A large part of his playing embraced the latin elements that were being incorporated into jazz at the time. I belief has at times brought tensions with band members. Recommended Listening: [Senor Mouse,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYXeQUk06wQ) [Now He Sings, Now He Sobs,](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HbrnzmBFDxc) (See Also: Michel Camilo

**Keith Jarrett**-As with Corea, then Charlse Loyd, and eventually Miles’ electric band. Jarrett played alongside Corea and stayed in the band awhile after his departure even though he didn’t like electric instruments. During the seventies, Jarrett began doing more quartet based work and began utilizing elements of avant-garde music, gospel, post bop and eventually European folk. Jarrett also redefined the constructs of Solo Piano by straying away from more prepared tune arrangements to extended and fully improvised songs lasting up to and hour long. While exploring his own compositions and fellow musicians, Jarrett found a new niche in his Standards Trio playing just Jazz Standards. The Standards Trio went on to become a huge success and helped in reviving the interest in adapting Standards. Jarrett is known for often standing up while playing and singing and moaning loudly. Jarrett is also a proficient alto sax player, [Spiral Dance,)",t5_2qmm6

Max is universally regarded as one of Jazz's great drummers

Max emerged in the 40's as the most innovative and consequently most important bebop drummer.  While Monk and Kenny Clarke held court at Minton's, Max set a blazing pace, raising countless hairs on the necks of jazz drummer everywhere.  He lit a fire under the asses of Bird, Diz, Bud and others for a decade.  When the greatest beboppers assembled to play [Massey hall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6ZjgGVNioo), Max's exclusive claim to the throne was self-evident.  

As bebop's influence plateaued toward the end of the 40's, he laid both the intellectual and musical foundation for cool jazz.  More importantly, he hooked up with a young trumpeter named [Clifford Brown](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXPzAasKWQg) to help forge the sound of modern jazz.  Max Roach and Clifford Brown are, as I see it, among the very few, along with Miles Davis, Art Blakey and Horace Silver who were responsible for the hard-bop aesthetic that dominated jazz in the 50s.  During this period, among others. 

Had Max never played another note after Clifford Browns death in 1956, came between 1958-1962, when his music gradually grew more personal, more political and a bit more ""out"".  Max's greatest gift, aside from his playing, was his ability to recognize and surround himself with extraordinary talent.  Starting in 1958, after tinkering for a while with the Clifford Brown band minus Clifford, he attracted a stable of talent that included Abbey Lincoln, Clifford Jordan, but still swinging.  I read an interview with Joe Chambers in which he suggests that the loosely associated musicians with whom Chambers played in the 60s

Max's recording career slowed down in the early 60s.  I've read that his political activities made recording more difficult, he recognized the epochal struggle for human rights happening around him and unabashedly made his music part of it.  If his career suffered for it, he never complained (to my knowledge anyway), and I believe that's one of the reasons he was recognized as one of jazz's great elder statesmen until the day he died.  

Wow, please do and I hope you enjoy.  

**[Max Roach + 4 on the Chicago Scene

This one isn't up on youtube, but he's starting to assemble the pieces for something more.  It also speaks to his eye for and dedication to attracting talent that he was able to replace Clifford Brown with Booker Little.  At 20 years old, Little is a fully-realized trumpet player with Clifford-like clarity and tone.  He was still growing and a composer and arranger and Max would be there with him until his early death.

**[Deeds

This is where it starts to come together for me.  Still with Booker Little and George Coleman and adding 17 year old Ray Draper on Tuba, even if it's not yet in the music, Max's political tendencies start to show in the album title.  Finally, the album art is just amazing.   

**[We Insist!

Skipping ahead a bit, Jr., who is worth checking out for his own work as a singer-songwriter.  This video is from a powerful televised performance in Germany.  I have to imagine Max would have had a hard time getting this on the air at home.  It speaks for itself.  

**[Percussion Bittersweet

This is my favorite Max Roach album.  It's got everything characteristic of Max's music at this time -- power and unapologetic politics, including two of my favorites, Eric Dolphy and Mal Waldron.  I could only find a link to the full album on ustream, but hopefully that works for everyone.  

**[Straight Ahead

This is an Abbey Lincoln album that I absolutely love.  In a short time, but also to the positive influence Max had over the people around him.  That, and there's some great playing by Coleman Hawkins.       

**[Money Jungle

I love music. All kinds of music. But my knowledge of jazz was and is only somewhat decent. I know most of the biggies by name- Miles, Louis, Ella, Brubeck, etc. - but I lack in-depth knowledge and context for some of the different genres of jazz. I like most everything I hear and I love playing music on the radio for people. Being able to share music with others is such a wonderful opportunity and I relish every part of it. Especially since it has helped to expand my own appreciation for jazz.

But since I have to program two 4-hour shows a week, most of my shows are peppered with songs and artists that you guys post links to here. Unwittingly, you've helped me program my shows and listeners really seem to like the music I play. I like it to.

So I thought that I should at least give you all a heartfelt ""Thank You"" for being unwitting participants in my radio show. I've slowly weaned myself off relying too heavily on the posts of r/jazz

TL;DR - I've been playing songs and artists posted on r/jazz on my radio show for a few weeks now

Why just not allow everything ? Because image are easier to see, long songs ask more time to be judged, and therefore gets upvoted less. Redditors (yeah, me too), like a quick shot of easily get gratification, in the form of a midly amusing image.

That's why we must put some rules.

I hope we find a nice set of rules that will fit everybody.

**TL;DR: Write your pics rules and upvote them !**

**Result EDIT**: There is an overwheliming will to have a stronger moderation regarding images.

* Don't put your whole collection

We decided to enrich the sidebar here at r/jazz, jazz flute, and so on, ranging from the beginnings to ultramodern stuff, hopefully with YouTube videos and recommended listening references.

I decided to start with a subject close to my heart, as well as those who I think are most interesting or representative of what is going on right now. If anyone feels as though their hero has gone unsung, comment and they might be added.

* 
Freddie Green

Freddie Green was the working guitarist in the Count Basie Orchestra. He never took solos, just the third and seventh (i.e. B and F on a G7), but there is a beautiful story about him: supposedly one day he got food poisoning right before the gig and couldn't play, and the drummer and bass player in the Orchestra, who had grown so accustomed to him, kept speeding up, slowing down

* 
 Charlie Christian

The first guitarist to really explore the electric guitar as a frontline in mainstream jazz. His solo on [Swing to Bop](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce9Jtl9D6FQ) is highly regarded to his day.

* 
 Django Reinhardt

Belgian gypsy guitarist who lived all of his life in France. Had two of the fingers on his left hand (the fret hand) badly burnt in a fire, he has become the single most idolised person in jazz, adored by gypsy jazz fans around the world - there are whole websites dedicated to him and [picks ](http://www.djangobooks.com/picks/moustache-picks/)made with his moustache on them. His solo on [Minor Swing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTlo809EIlo&amp;ob=av2n) is played as a theme by some guitarists today.

* 
Wes Montgomery

Wes is definitely one of the most influential guitarists. He developed his trademark thumb-picking technique when he had to practice at night in the small apartment that he shared with his wife and child, as is Boss Guitar or Bumpin' (although by that, he had moved more into a poppy setting).

* 
Jim Hall

Jim Hall might just be the most underrated guitarist (still) playing today. His book Introducing Jazz Guitar shows an advanced mastery of the art and craft

* 
Joe Pass

Joe Pass will perhaps be best remembered for his work on the solo guitar improvised jazz context

* 

George Benson

George Benson, is also an accomplished vocalist in his own right, more suitable for fans of pop-jazz and beautiful ballads on a cozy winter night, or for those just getting into jazz. Here he is singing what some might consider his trademark song, [This Masquerade](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RpEfAV1T5b0).

* 
Pat Metheny

Too many fans would hate if I didn't say anything about Metheny. While his technique, but some of us might have a problem with some of the more (for lack of a better word) cheesy stuff he does in his Group with Lyle Mays.

* 
John McLaughlin

Interesting to guitarists in particular as being the only well known guitarist to play with classical as opposed to violin-style left hand technique

* 
John Scofield

John Scofield is a modern player in the most urban sense. Moving from straight-ahead jazz, through fusion on Blue Matter to his quartet with Mulgrew Miller, John is always great to see.

* 
Kurt Rosenwinkel

Probably the most influential guitarist in terms of the contemporary mainstream sound. His innovative use of effects as well as newer harmonic devices (most notably stacked fourth chords) and extended composition, but Enemies of Energy is a beautiful piece of modern jazz.

* 
Bill Frisell

Moving into more modern territory, and sometimes by art-rock. Mixing beautiful [solo pieces](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Svzv-YkUzdk) to [larger ensembles](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TD26t_GtUTY&amp;feature=related), you can never know what to expect from him.

* 
Ben Monder

Although I'm sure I've ommited many great guitarists, by my standards, the best jazz guitarist alive today. Technically I'm pretty sure that's true, and his compositions on his own albums (especially Oceana, an absolute masterpiece) show great artistic heights. At least listen to [this](http://grooveshark.com/#/s/Oceana/2B4qZG?src=5). I'm super cereal.

Anyway, feel free to do one as well.

Edit: In order to only include people who are very very important (it is an introduction), he will be added.

Edit: Added Green, please bear in mind that this is an introduction - though I love Stanley Jordan and Charley Byrd and many other names, they really don't fit into an introduction. I know you're going say that neither does Ben Monder, but that was just my little reward to myself for taking the time to do this :)

sounds quite a bit better than

C E G B D F

for various reasons. A big part of it is because of how the F clashes with the E and B under it. I'm sure there are other reasons too

However

F A C E G B D F.

That top F sounds pretty bad. I think it's due both to the the intervals it forms with lower notes, you can avoid having any diminished or augmented triads by simply alternating between major and minor thirds, like so:

C E G B D F# A C#

and you can go further

C E G B D F# A C# E G# B D# F# A# C# F Ab C Eb...

As you stack thirds, it will have all 12 unique pitch classes).

This 'chord' does have compound minor 9ths and tritones

Has anyone else noticed this? any thoughts? has this been used in any way by composers or improvisers?

So we're playing
We get to the blues tune where I take a solo. The solo starts mid chorus (bar 5)
8 bars later
He asks me how long I've been playing. I tell him seven years. He says he can tell
Then he proceeds to tell me that I'm in my own little world. I'm playing to myself. By myself. For myself.
He was right. Not necessarily cliched licks
There was no story in my solo

So
They line them up against a wall
They give me the opportunity to play one more solo. That determines their fate.

So then he says ""Now

And I did.

It wasn't some reincarnation of Cannonball's brilliance or a Grammy-winning solo.
It wasn't even technically difficult
But it was in the groove.
So we keep going

Halfway through

I'm going ""oh shit oh shit oh shit""

But then he turns to the rhythm section and says ""Listen up. You guys are on the verge of killing this man's family. He's listening to you. You better damn well listen to him.""

And then we did it again.

*And it grooved.*

Almost everything posted to this sub is simply a link to a YouTube video of some performance or recording. Few of them ever get more than a dozen upvotes--despite almost 25, they're just links to things that various members--for whatever reason--think ""sound cool."" But if I'm in the mood to hear a random selection of jazz recordings, I don't need Reddit for that. I can sign in to Pandora, or got to any one of dozens of sites, or just link around on YouTube on my own.

Yesterday, or contrast with, Japanese jazz--or jazz in general? It's gotten so bad that when I see *any* context in the title (""nice blues with merengue rhythm""; ""unique combination of jazz/beat-boxing""; ""Here is Morphine, a pretty unknown group that existed until 1999""), I'm delighted.

Jazz is a huge world, instrument, and technique. The best thing that we can do in this subreddit is *teach each other*. To this end, my recommendation is that when posting such links, the OP writes a couple paragraphs about the music and why he or she thought we should all listen to it. If I was posting, say, a link to [Sonny Rollins's ""Autumn Nocturne""](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_tOlwXbOsE)

***

Rollins recorded this live at the Great American Music Hall in San Francisco in 1978

For the first four minutes, he starts playing a regular rhythm to signal the rest of the band. Most important, notice the enormous sense of release that accompanies the entrance of the other instruments at 04:13, finally giving us a baseline. The obviously-exhausted Rollins plays a few more triumphant choruses before concluding the performance.

***

Now, and the OP can get the link karma. But either way, readers would learn more and have a basis for a stronger discussion in the comments.

Thanks for listening.

EDIT: Cool

EDIT 2: Just met Andreas Varady with his father and brother. They are here for the festival as well. Really cool guys. My collegue will be spotlighting them for 2 days in Riga if you want to see the story it's here http://gotlatte.com/rigas_ritmi/12919a Added more of your questions to my list. It's 00:00 AM now in Riga. In 9 hours I'll be meeting Robert Glasper. Will check this reddit post for more questions in the morning.

EDIT 3: The day of following Robert Glasper is over. It was a cool experience. Robert's Q&amp;A was superb
–Regarding collaboration with Frank Ocean: ""Maybe
–Regarding tours: ""I'll be in Rhode Island in August and will start touring the US in September.""
–Regarding the AMA: ""I've heard of reddit and people did mention doing an AMA to me before. We'll see.""
Sorry for not getting all the answers you were hoping for.

Tomorrow I'll be meeting MMW and will report on how that went.

EDIT 4: It's been a terrific day. Met John Medeski

About the records and/or live shows with John Scofield.
–Yes
About when the album with skerik and Adam Deitch is coming out.
–This Fall! 
About collaboration between MMW and Antibalas
–They would love to do it but it's difficult both financially and time (a lot of people in Antibalas). 

Lastly

**EVERYONE**

* We're all here to make beautiful music together. You should be able to do that with an advanced pyrotechnician or a first-timer. Everyone is responsible for making the music sound great.

* Play at a volume appropriate to the venue. If you're in a cafe

* Keep your instrument silent between songs.

* Keep your instrument silent between sets. Never play once the house music is on.

* Listen to music away from the gigs! Know the names of the songs and their forms.

**SINGERS**

* I've played with a lot of great vocalists who didn't know exactly how jazz worked, and the soloists improvise over it. At the end it will be your turn again. Soloists will be let down if you start singing again and it's not your turn. Stand off to the side and follow the form (the easiest way to do that is to can keep singing the song over and over in your head ). Hopefully someone will nod or cue you when its your turn to close the song out. Very often, this will happen in the middle of the form -- on the ""bridge"", So look for that.
 
* If you want to do an awesome scat solo, talk about it with the band ahead of time. 

* Have the lyrics memorized. 

* Know what key is good for you for that song. Ideally you pick a song where your key matches up with the key in the band's book/brain. If you have to ask for a different key

**HORN**

* Stay focussed while you're not playing.  Follow the form in your head. Keep track of who has soloed and who hasn't. Know when the head is coming back around.

* Don't rush it. Careful that you don't drop a beat/measure in quiet passages/turnarounds.  Those parts are important to the song form and tension/resolution.

* Similar to the advice for the rhythm section


**BAND LEADER**

* Call the tune. Say the name of the song, and any tricky bits (preferably between sets and not on the bandstand), especially if this isn't your regular band.

* Know the song you're going to play next.



**RHYTHM SECTION**

* Most of the time you're playing

* Be in control of your dynamics. Bring it down for quiet soloists

* Chord instruments: If the guitar, it's going to get muddy. Ideally, you work this out ahead of time. Changing who holds down the chords every few choruses can make for easy, cool dynamics. If you haven't worked it out ahead of time, defer to the piano, with the guitar just playing accents, turnarounds

* Be careful of your volume/dynamics at all tempos. Fast doesn't always mean loud.

* If you get lost… There's probably someone in the rhythm section who's sort of the section leader. Look to them. If you have to, strolling/laying out sounds better than playing the wrong chords. 

* If the soloist gets lost… Switch to the most vanilla version of the song you can play. Quote the melody. Lead the spaceship back into dock.

* Keep the tempo as it was called. Otherwise

**DRUMMER/PERCUSSION**

* A lot of the drummers I've played with are recent converts from some other American style of music (rock, it makes the song swing less. For some reason, the snare on the backbeat tends to creep into ballads. Try to keep the ballads swinging - if you play the backbeat too many times it ends up sounding like a rock power ballad.

* The drums are lower in the mix in jazz than in other American styles. Make sure you're leaving enough room. You should be able to hear the bass clearly

* If you're having trouble keeping up with a super-fast song like ""Cherokee"" or ""Anthropology"", you'll also be playing over everyone else. Similarly, the secret to nailing those super-fast tunes is to learn to play extremely lightly. Less is more.

* People would rather you trade fours than solo. Trading fours is awesome. Ask about it before the set/before the song.

* Drummers need to learn song too! Know the names of the songs and their forms.

**PIANO**

* You are likely to be the best jazz theorist in the rhythm section, you can do a  lot to keep everyone from losing the form (see the RHYTM SECTION parts about people getting lost).

* Careful with your left hand. If there's a bass player

**BASS**

* Honestly

* Know lots of songs. It's easier for the bass to memorize a ton of songs than it is for the chordal instruments. Do it!

* If you use an amp

* If you use an amp

Welcome to another part of An Introduction to...This time, I would love it if some people could comment on actual technical achievements (although they might not be as important as the musical ones). Please feel free to make one of these, but PM me about it first, so if there is more than one person doing the same section, you can work on it together.

So, I would post them here first, before I discussed the other ""runners up"".

* Charlie ""Bird"" Parker

The father of bebop. He loved chicken, [Confirmation](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zV6y1f7CU-A) It has become common courtesy to trade Charlie Parker stories, here are some of my favourites:

While still in Kansas City, flat thirteens, sharp elevens, flat nines. He wasn't doing terribly well (understatement) so Papa Joe Jones took off one of his cymbals and threw it at his feet, ending his time playing there. Bird proceeded to practice some more, go back there and kill.

Once Miles Davis - while he was still young, and proceed to have the hooker pleasure his nether regions. Miles was very uncomfortable with this, but Bird didn't give a shit.

One time, so two men had to hold him up while he played - [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNJpes0XFGU) is what came out of that session. There are endless stories of him trading his saxophone for money at a pawn shop so he could buy some heroin (or chicken) and showing up at a gig, making the band leader go to the pawn shop to get his horn.

* John ""'Trane"" Coltrane

Again, he pioneered modal jazz on Miles Davis' Kind of Blue album. Then, he moved more into modality with stuff like My Favorite Things. Then, he made one of the most spiritual recordings in jazz, A Love Supreme, a three part suite. Then, he went more into spirituality and free jazz. Then, listen to [Blue Train](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1GrP6thz-k)

Okay

* Lester ""Prez"" Young

Nicknamed ""Prez"" (short for President), which goes perfectly with his lyrical, soft, linear style of playing, which is best heard on ballads, like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtgUbJN8oPE) one with Billie Holiday. One of his best recorded solos is one on [Tea for Two](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VAG_Yo8709o). He was famous for wearing pork pie hats, and upon his passing

* Coleman ""Hawk"" Hawkins

A direct contemporary of Lester Young, everyone was improvising on the melody of the song, taking that as a basis for whatever solos they were going to play. Here, Hawkins not only improvises his solo based on the changes (harmony) of the song rather than the tune (melody), but he gets rid of the melody alltogether.

* Sonny Rollins

One of the few jazz greats alive that where there when it all happened in the 50's and 60's, but thinking that he should be better, thus going ""shedding"" (when you essentially lock yourself up and practice, comes from being in a woodshed), and practicing on the Williamsburg Bridge every night, then coming back and blowing everyone away. His solo on [Tenor Madness](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KW33ye4fPBA) is legendary, and the recording of his rhythm changes tune [Oleo](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-7ah7unyXbA) with Miles Davis is as good-rhythm-changes as you'll get.

* Cannonball Adderley

Often playing with his brother Nat on cornet, his version of [Nardis](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u9tNT-Ub2K0) is beautiful and the album [In New York](http://grooveshark.com/#/album/In+New+York/4330264) is an amazing live album.

* Wayne Shorter

Another one of those giants who are still with us today, both in the minor blues and waltz realms. He played a crucial part in Miles Davis' [second great quartet](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x_whk6m67VE), and his album [Speak no Evil](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njo1zvr216s) is considered a jazz masterpiece by many.

* Joe Henderson

Most famous for supposedly writing one of the ultimate jazz standards, he is one of the players to really go deep into harmony, mostly pentatonic scale applications, as well as lydian modalities. His tune [Inner Urge](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1jOIAos3nk) has one of the most interesting harmonies of any featured in the standard repertoire.

1364781191.0,1be6rf,A friend of mine (tenor saxophonist) just played his first gig at a Nudist Resort. Here's his account of the event,senorfantastic,47,8,12,"So.  Last night I had my first gig at a little-known location known as the [REDACTED] Nudist Resort.  (Yes, I figured I'd give you a rough recap of that little soiree:

 

6:30: Arrive at destination where the guy working the guard shack gives me directions to the restaurant where the band will be playing.  Director frantically calling me as I'm talking to the guard shack guy

 

6:30:10: First full-frontal sighting of a lady strolling down the street in a manner not unlike that of the old Bigfoot movies.  Yes, I maintain control of my vehicle.

 

6:35: Park and begin the usual Normandy invasion of load-in.  Spot dudes walking around among the campground, these dudes are -- well, there's just no words for it.

 

6:40: Not possessing of one of the requisite articles of Floridian attire -- a Hawaiian shirt -- I get one from one of the other guys in the band.  He says I can change in the bathroom outside, it's not like I'm gonna get in trouble for it or anything.

 

6:45: Safely inside the restaurant, appears to have been built during the Gemini program years, because it looks like it could hold two people.  It's gonna be tight up there tonight, I think to myself.

 

6:46-6:59:59: Frantically sort out first set worth of music.

 

7:00: Hit.  No one on the dance floor yet.  Lighting in our faces

 

7:01: Look to my right, typical thing you see on a Saturday night restaurant outing, right?  Must.focus.on.chord.changes.

 

7:15: The restaurant manager comes over to complain that the bass player's stand light is getting in people's eyes and that we're too loud.  Because having lights in your eyes is a bad thing at this gig?

 

7:20: We play Dizzy's ""Groovin' High"".  It won't be the only groove I see that night.

 

7:40: We play ""Too Close For Comfort""

 

7:50: We play ""Corner Pocket"".  Now

 

*** 1ST INTERMISSION ***

 

8:00: Second set aka the ""crowd pleaser set"".  Dance floor is starting to pick up.  Choice of attire for men seems to be sandals and unbuttoned button-down shirts.  Attire for women seems to be top optional and/or tight mesh dresses (if you can call them that) that look like they lost a fight with an International Harvester thresher.  Jiggle factor increasing rapidly.

 

8:15: I note that thankfully, so I neither can stand up, or get down on the dance floor.  This is a relief because I don't need any incidental contact with my ultra-shiny tenor sax.  Because buttflesh.

 

8:25: We do ""Johnny B. Goode""

 

8:30: We do the EWF rendition of ""Got To Get You Into My Life""

 

8:35: Just one of many random times I thank my lucky stars there's a music stand obscuring my immediate line of sight.  It's much like a lunar eclipse: The moon(s) pass(es) from one side of my stand

 

8:45: We do ""Mustang Sally"".  I hate ""Mustang Sally"".  Can I tell you how much?  Ride, indeed.  (Editor's note: Please do not ask me what I renamed this tune to.)

 

8:something: Twin-engine blondewich makes her appearance on the dancefloor.  Best thing going for the eyesight that night, a dude who appears to be her meal ticket, and a black lace/fishnet dress (if you can call it that) that barely covers the top of OHMYGODISTHATWHATITHINKITIS?

 

(Shortly thereafter

 

*** 2ND INTERMISSION ***

 

9:00: Third and final set; more ""crowd pleasers"".  Thankfully

 

9:10: We play a tune affectionately titled ""Raw Bones"".  I am not making this up.  (It's a trombone feature

 

9:25: We play the old chestnut

 

9:30-on: The Blondewich's boyfriend keeps calling for us to play some Earth

 

9:40: We play ""You Make Me Feel So Young""

 

9:50: We skip ""That Warm Feeling"".  Don't ask what it is.

 

9:55: Oh God.  Here it comes.  I can feel it.  The director calls out ""Y.M.C.A."".  The crowd loves it and packs the dance floor.  Unfortunately

 

10:00: Encore time!  This'll get 'em going and send 'em out on a high note: ""In The Mood"" by Glenn Miller, probably including Glenn Miller himself.

 

Oh

If we start with a standard, although I prefer a small combo sound.

I'm also up for a keys or guitar player just doodling and laying down some moving chords, drums, and repeating until we converge to something nice.
