/r/Subaru is legitimately my favourite subreddit. Aside from my love of all things Subaru

The biggest concern with growth is the dilution of quality in a subreddit. I can categorically state that the quality is currently at a higher standard than it's ever been but there has been one particular element that has been concerning myself &amp; the rest of the mod team and that's bullying and abuse.

Chances are

There has been a concerning increase in the number of posts and comments being flagged for our attention where members are being abusive to each other and whilst I'll avoid specifics

###My request is simple: 
Be nice to each other. Keep posting amazing content and respect your fellow /r/Subaru members.

We take a zero tolerance attitude to immature and abusive behaviour and hopefully you will too.

Thank you to every single one of you for contributing to this incredible community and I can't wait until we break 20k!
