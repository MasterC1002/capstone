1372273546.0,1h4kf5,My thoughts on the villains of Avengers 2 &amp; 3,AlibiBreakfast,87,13,21,"When Joss Whedon was asked how he would approach Avengers 2

During a recent twitter Q&amp;A, maybe Malekith lives or perhaps the Enchantress is cameoed in TDW.

During a radio [interview](http://www.comicbookmovie.com/fansites/MarvelFreshman/news/?a=69509), it's a good run,” Frank Grillo said."" Maybe Robert Redford's character in CA: TWS will actually be Baron Zemo or maybe Thanos rescues the Red Skull from the dimension he was sent to in exchange for his help.

In the Marvel one-shot [The Consultant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vk8r1uZ7Liw), will be featured in CA 2 and this base is the location of a super-villain prison in the Ultimate comic universe.

I'm guessing that Thanos' back story is fleshed out a little in Guardians of the Galaxy (who he likely defeats and/or kills to heighten the stakes and highlight how dangerous he is) then he rounds up these villains to take on the Avengers, of course, be defeated and this would make Thanos the puppet master of the trilogy and set the stage for the final showdown in Avengers 3 after he presumably acquires either the Infinity Gauntlet (which would just make him too powerful) or the Tessaract (which could make a bookend on the trilogy). When Whedon was recently asked about Thanos, his [response](http://screenrant.com/the-avengers-3-thanos-joss-whedon/) was “Thanos is more powerful. He’s not someone you just trot out and punch him. Like you did in the comics, you want him to be threading through the universe and to save the big finale for the big finale.""",,False,t5_2uii8,True

I think its safe to assume at least one movie a year from 2017 to 2021 and probably two movies a year for at least one of those four years

*Iron Man - 2008

*The Incredible Hulk - 2008

*Iron Man 2 - 2010

*Thor - 2011

*Captain America: The First Avenger - 2011

*Marvel's The Avengers - 2012

*Iron Man 3 - 2013

*Thor : The Dark World - 2013

*Captain America: The Winter Solider - Apr 2014

*Guardians of The Galaxy - Aug 2014

*Marvel's The Avengers: Age of Ultron - May 2015

*Ant-Man - Nov 2015

*Unannounced - May 2016

*Unannounced - July 2016

*Unannounced - May 2017

*Assumed 2018 (The Avengers 3?)

*Assumed 2019

*Assumed 2020

*Assumed 2020

*Assumed 2021

That's at least eight movies coming in their current plan outline to 2021

Let's make some education guesses of nerdy speculation.

What will the next eight movies be?

What new characters will be introduced in their own solo films? (The heavily rumored Doctor Strange and Black Panther phase three films).

What new character will be introduced in as part of sequel films? (Black Window, Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch).

What comic story lines will be adapted into phase 3 and 4? (The Winter Solider

When will Thanos appear as main protagonist? (The Avengers 3?)

Will Marvel re introduce characters that had previous films with other studios? (Daredevil,,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,True

In Phase 1, Tony Stark is literally dying. I doubt that has been a greater symbolic sign of inner turmoil than him literally dying because of forces inside his body. 

Thor had to deal with his ego and pride (a lot like Stark...except he found a way to deal with differently). Cap had to deal with adjusting to a new world (his movie didn't really focus on much turmoil inside, and Black Widow constantly talked about the ""red on her ledger""...pretty obvious inner turmoil.

It was the tiniest moment that I think was poetic is small way because the Arc Reactor and the shrapnel were finally together like lovers separated by Atlantic. Tony built the reactor to keep the metal away from his heart and has been part of him since his capture in 2008 and has largely been part of his identity as Iron Man every since as it the power source to both his suit and his motivation. But true purpose was protect Tony and always be a magnet to attract something it will never see. The reactor and the shrapnel are forever connected by this. So when the surgery removes the metal the reactor attracts it with open arms finally together and serving its purpose.

I have probably already given it away

But I do believe that Stark **did** create Ultron. 

Let me explain. There is one character in the MCU that received a HUGE makeover. J.A.R.V.I.S. For those who didn't know...[this is Edwin Jarvis] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis#Film), flesh and bone person. Not an advanced computer program. The reason for this change was never stated, but I have always assumed that it was to make it so that while Tony worked or was in the Iron Man suit, he wouldn't have sit in silence, and also gave a little more humor to the films.   

But now, we have even heard inflections in his voice suggesting that he does have emotions (he goes even so far to suggest that Tony call Pepper win he is headed into the wormhole as it is probable that he will die). 

Who is the only other person to be able to control an Iron Man suit in the films outside of Stark or Rhodie? JARVIS. 

Like in so many films

To further the idea of machines vs humans

In *Iron Man 3*, JARVIS flies the suit to Rose Hill, Tennessee to which Tony (who was passed out the entire flight and incapable of controlling the suit) claims ""Why? This was not my idea. JARVIS responds with ""I think I'm malfunctioning."" And then JARVIS shuts down with the suit. But no worry, JARVIS is seen alive and well later in the movie.

Here's mine:

1. Iron Man

2. Iron Man 2

 2.1. Marvel One-Shot - A Funny Thing Happened On The Way To Thor's Hammer

3. Thor

4. The Incredible Hulk

 4.1. Marvel One-Shot - The Consultant

5. Captain America - The First Avenger

6. The Avengers

 6.1. Marvel One-Shot - Item 47

And Iron Man 3, but no particular order yet because I haven't seen them.

I chose this order because the first 2 Iron Man films go first, Thor's hammer shows up. So you can watch the short about Coulson's trip there, then Thor. Then Incredible Hulk, and since Stark appears at the end, you watch The Consultant short after it (since IM2 established him as the consultant). Then, Captain America because it seems as though Fury has already assembled the team at the end and the rest of the film seems like a flashback. Then Avengers and then Item 47 since it's right afterward and a bit of an epilogue.

So how about you guys? What order do you watch in,False,self,t5_2uii8,False,,ironman,t3_1gd8fu

As we near the releases of MCU film releases, clips, posters, and general marketing materials...many of which may include characters and plot developments in the film that some may not wish to know before seeing the movie.

It becomes difficult to define what classifies as a ""spoiler""

At the moment, the images of these armors are plastered everywhere...

So how would we post them without spoiling anything?  We would have to title the post as something like ""New Iron Man 3 images"".  This would garner much less attention and would defeat the purpose of a title

So, tv-spots, and any other marketing materials.  These are advertisements.

So what are going to be considered spoilers?  Any information which is not publicly released by Marvel Studios.  However

Hey guys, I'm creating my own custom box-set. I'm simply buying the blu-rays and replacing the insert-art. I'm also going to have to customize the actual box itself.

Being an MCU fanatic rather than a comic reader myself, he made the following comment that I think addresses a lot of what people might have overlooked. In case the comment disappears from top comment on YT

&gt;Guy Pearce is as much of the Mandarin as Liam Neeson was Ra's al Ghul. That is, but the core is still there:
&gt;
&gt;-Genius scientist
&gt;
&gt;-Hates Iron Man
&gt;
&gt;-Shoots fire
&gt;
&gt;-Has super powers
&gt;
&gt;-Martial artist
&gt;
&gt;-Dragon tattoos
&gt;
&gt;-Fascination with ancient China
&gt;
&gt;-Petty
&gt;
&gt;Et﻿ cetera. Imagine if the guy in the beard had been the Mandarin. It would've been disappointing because he had none of the above traits like the comics Mandarin.

So what do you guys think? General thoughts or anything that you hadn't realized before that makes sense now?

1361337278.0,18vbpn,Theory on How Shared Universe Would Work...,AppleTStudio,19,6,37,"So [as of recent rumors](http://comicbook.com/blog/2013/02/17/planet-hulk-movie-could-those-rumors-confirm-a-unified-marvel-movieverse/) regarding the possibility of every Marvel film coexisting in a multi-studio universe

The answer lies with X-Men: Days of Future Past. 

For those unfamiliar with DoFP

As of right now, 4, different universes with different timelines. They are as followed:

•	Avengers Timeline

•	X-Men: Origins through The Last Stand

•	X-Men: First Class

•	The Amazing Spider-Man



Now, say, The Avengers universe alongside of Stark Industries.

Mark Millar has said recently that he wants to create a shared universe for X-Men and Fantastic Four (being rebooted very soon) that does not contradict The Avengers universe. This sudden change cannot just happen out of nowhere. There is also the problem of unifying the two X-Men universes. 

I believe an Event will happen in Days of Future Past that will allow the unity of both X-Men universes to occur

Even more so

The best part about all of this is that, the OSCORP Tower plans were given to Disney by Sony, but was not incorporated into The Avengers due to time restraints).

Because changes that occur from time travel are seamless


Now

Think of Quentin Tarantino and how all of his films are tied together. Remember Red Apple cigarettes? They can be found in every movie that is connected to one of Quentin Tarantino’s universes.

Essentially,” or something along those lines.

On April 18th, you may do so in the comments section of this thread.  ANY SINGLE POSTS CREATED FOR THE PURPOSE OF REVIEWING IRON MAN 3 WILL BE REMOVED.

Posts pertaining to discussion of the film in any aspect other than posting a ""film review"" of the movie will be allowed as usual.

This policy will also be in effect for any future film releases unless otherwise noted.

If the official review thread is significantly buried by the time Iron Man 3 is released in the UK or US

The purpose of having dedicated posts where reviews may be posted in the comments is to eliminate excessive post clutter in the subreddit.

We will be more lenient about film review posts several weeks after a films release.

Hammer would be difficult because Norman Osborn is not in the MCU to bring them back after the events in IM2.  Yeah they could change the story but it just doesn't seem likely.

I believe that in future movies we will see a combination of AIM and Hydra.  Maybe hopefully see Baron Zemo or Madame Hydra and if it could be pulled off visually see MODOK.  For the cosmic side I see either the Kree or Skrulls. (I believe Marvel has the Kree rights but not Skrull.  *Possible GotG spoiler warning*[Especially if that rumor of Ronan the Accuser being in GotG is true than yeah they would have Kree film rights.](/spoiler)

Surely the return of Extremis will be Iron Man's Extremis armor but what if it could be used to bring the Red Hulk to the MCU? AIM assisted in the creation of the Red Hulk in the comics and the organization was introduced in Iron Man 3. What if Ross undergoes a similar procedure like Blonsky but injects himself with Extremis as an alternative?

Firstly Robert Downey Jr. is out of contract after IM3 (correct me if I'm wrong) so unless Marvel and RDJ thrash something out quickly there wouldn't be time to rewrite a whole script to remove Iron Man from the Guardians of the Galaxy film if no deal was made. Would Marvel have a back-up storyline prepped? Or maybe that is why we are seeing MCU elements introduced into Nova comics (as a potential replacement character)?

Particularly when Iron Man comes swooping by to help Widow, then up to the roof to help Hawkeye fend off his perch and then smashing Chitauri troops into the Leviathan that Hulk then stabs with debris and Thor hammers it (with lightning) home, crashing it down for Hulk to comically punch Thor off the screen.

Personally, and would add a Moon Knight movie.

I've always had a certain affinity for Moon Knight.  He's a really fascinating character and I think a movie based on his comic would be something refreshingly darker and grittier in the MCU

I also read awhile ago that Marvel was going to do bigger and better things with there Marvel One Shots. I heard they were going to do short films (10 mins) to introduce a character

What do you guys think?

So explanations

* S.H.E.I.L.D series would focus on the aftermath of the event of The Avengers, mainly the premiere and finale episodes but the majority of it will be handled by Maria Hill. Perhaps even cameos from Black Widow and Hawkeye....and obviously mentions of the Avengers, like keeping tabs on them. New agent on the job, Jessica Drew, learns to cope with daily life within SHIELD and the series is mainly seen from her POV, entering this hectic world and her journey to becoming Spider-Woman. Cameos from the likes of Falcon, Agent Sitwell

I'm sure there's enough material for a second and maybe 3rd series but I ain't got enough knowledge

In the second series

* Hulk t.v series will show what Banner is doing after the Avengers. With the knowledge on how to control the Hulk, Rhino and Ringmaster and a return of the Abomination). All actors/actresses from the Incredible Hulk movie should reprise their roles and Banner/Hulk is of course played by Ruffalo. In the S.H.I.E.L.D show, certain information would be seen on screens or even mentioned about Banner and his movements.

* Ant-Man
Origins of Ant-Man and Wasp

* Daredevil series would be more detached from the other shows,Bullseye, The Jester, Mister Fear and The Punisher (cameo in a 2 or 3 partner from his own series). Foggy Nelson will of course appear and even a cameo from Moon Knight as well. Ben Urich and the Daily Bugle will also appear, maybe a cameo from J.J.J. as well, not sure yet.


* The Amazing Spider-man 2
Yes, decides he needs help with stopping Osborn. Fury believes Peter can do it on his own. Peter can't join the Avengers until he's 18...or 21...Whichever.


* The Punisher series will be dark and gritty and gory, his reasons for doing what he does and facing baddies, notably Jigsaw, Hitman, Elite, Payback, Finn Cooley and The Russian.

* For the third installments I'd just keep them on track with where the current one is going

* Black Panther movie would obviously show his origins

* Guardians of the Galaxy 2. I have no idea...maybe Kang the Conqueror or something....if anything I wouldn't have a sequel to them unless they made the 3rd Avengers another cosmic force to deal with instead of the Civil War route I've taken. 

* Dr Strange movie would show his origins and open up the magical part of the MCU and the villain would be Baron Mordo. Not really much I can say on this but I reckon near the end he'll decide to try either join the Avengers or then start his own group

* Heroes for Hire would be either a short series maybe 6 hour long episodes which shows Luke Cage (Power Man), She-Hulk (who could cameo in SHEILD, Daredevil or Hulk) and Namor. The First episode is them joining together and flashbacks to origins or bits of backstory with the story showing them working together to tackle problems to big for ordinary people but too small for the Avengers to get involved. A second series, if there was one, could add in Ghost Rider, Silver Sable and Paladin...

* 2019
Would have final sequel movies for the main 3 Avengers

* Yea a 2 parter....kinda like Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was divided. A huge catastrophe like in the comics kills hundreds of innocent people and children which is blamed on superpowered people and causes an uprising within the general public and begins the superhero registration act....well you know the comics. This will have cameos and appearances from almost every hero and villian who isn't dead who has been introduced in the MCU movies and shows. Yea....
yea I know

But yea through those next 8 years if you also include the DC movies to come out
