Built with students and freelance creatives in mind.   

------
A little more about me and the app:

My name is Julian Thayn

A year later and with a few contract apps under my belt I set off on my own and developed Clocked.  Clocked was born out of a frustration towards the time tracking programs I've been unhappily using for years while designing. Whether it be desktop, unintuitive, overcomplicated and with features I didn't need or care about.  

I set out to make an app that was simple to use, reading or what have you. 

I believe I accomplished this and am proud to introduce Clocked!

I ran into a situation that was rather maddening last week, and though I would save some people's sanity in explaining the problem and how it was fixed.

Situation:
An enterprise signed iOS app that I distributed ala ""OTA"" installation (simply over an internal web site) was built from my Mac to a device, installed and successfully downloaded on and since July 24th, 2102.

Last week

The app built successfully, the first screen, fetched and processed data from the internet and then quit without throwing an error.  

No SIGABRT

Xcode reports ""Process cannot be found"".

W T F ?

Nothing useful in the console output

I looked and all my certs and provisions were legit and able to be used to distribute the app.  I walked the source code tree back all the way to July 24th and the same thing happened with EVERY SINGLE code snapshot.

How the hell can something like this happen?  Why did it happen?  These questions remain unanswered.

I compared the app's build and code signing settings to that of another project I built to the device and deployed two weeks ago.  They matched

For code signing

Assuming that the fact that I was able to build to a device and got this to work for the iPad project at 5 AM

Viola.  It worked.  I was able to build to the device.

Now

In any case, check to make sure you haven't applied your distribution certificate to the Debug section of your target app's code signing.

I still have no idea why or how this worked in the past
It's entirely possible that I assumed that I was building to the device or only looked at code that was checked in AFTER I changed the code signing.  No idea.  I'm just glad it works, at least throw some error messages in cases like this.

We've spent considerable amount of money as well as months of our own time in developing the app, and the rebranded app wouldn't drive any traffic to our business.

We also have some brick and mortar retail partners that has expressed low level interest as using our app as a sort of in-store kiosk (which most likely would drive traffic to us)

I could see us ""leasing"" the app, and further development. At the end of the lease, we'd have made some money and would also have a better app. I'm not sure if this is feasible, however, because they certain have in house IT resources that I imagine are at least as capable as I am.

I'm the same

I've been seeing increasing numbers of platforms/frameworks/etc that enable developers to write apps using other technologies (specifically HTML5 and CSS)

This is great in the bigger scheme of things, yadda yadda yadda... However, as someone who has a vested interest in recouping the time and effort I've expended to become a competent iOS developer, I'm worried that this trend will have the effect of diluting the opportunities I will have to make a living from the platform.

They have been corporate use with login required so nothing to post / brag about. They are free apps with niche markets.

The Android side is really simple. Create the app

The iOS side is not so simple. Create the app

Since the iOS side is scary / annoying / drawn out I think it forces you to really think about your program. You want a solid QA process. You want to triple check things as you don't want to get rejected. I don't care for fear when programming though. I don't get happy thoughts about Apple. I have been rejected for unfounded reasons. I have been rejected for good reasons - they found a crashing bug. I have been accepted then done a bug fix that was rejected then accepted when I started asking why. They had picked the wrong thing in a drop down combobox

You don't get much in the way of crash reports from Apple either. Their store statistics are not very good.

As for Google / Android I have neither love nor hate. I publish the app

If someone finds a bug I get a crash log from Google and I can generally track it down and fix it as I get a full Java stack dump. The store statistics are acceptable but not eyeball bending.

In the end I end up with a fear and hate of the Apple process and I just find the Android process to be a tool I use at release time.

if you don't mind a intro I'd like to start by saying that I'm new to iOS developing and i find it very interesting and feel very good vibes about it, and currently studying Java at Uni. Secondly what I feel should be noted is that I'm a bit low on the budget side and can't/couldn't afford an apple station to work on and my only way of going around this was setting up a dual boot win7/hackintosh, just so anyone who thinks that this is a unethical way of going about it, if felt like that will simply mind their very way past my post.
During and ordinary day at work, and from within that conversation that was spawned an idea for a app was born and contributed to by the both of us.
I myself including the other person feel that this idea hold some ground and should be realized.
Mainly it's a calendar based app.
The user will be asked to enter a certain date, and in that message a youtube video might be included a personal message, a warning, a quote... within the next 7 days the app should inform the user with certain messages that contain informational content of the type of the apps idea several time per day say 3 times in the morning, afternoon, and at night, those messages to be able to include youtube videos, some common sense.
And at the end of every message, of course the topic being related to the base of the apps idea, so that the users can gain more info from each others experiences, providing more support.
Now my question here is how to go about it

Thanks all for the great feedback. The solutions to this seem to be:

1. Develop the app under Apple's [b2b](https://developer.apple.com/programs/volume/b2b/) program.  The client will have to sign up for Apple's Volume Purchase Program which looks to be at no cost.

UPDATE - I think I may have found the problem.  The ""copyItemAtPath"" function does not have an overwrite mode, and no file copy was happening.  I switched around the logic to do ""If X exists then move it to temp, then copy default to X, then if X exists (successful copy), go ahead and delete the temp copy.""

Help!,tharris0101,8,4,12,"I have an songwriting app [Songsmith](http://loneyeti.com/songsmith) that is iPhone only and works great. I want to make it into a universal app that works on iPad as well. Sharing the app's data through iCloud seemed to be a no-brainer

My app is currently SQLite backended

In learning Core Data over iCloud

* Core Data over iCloud works fine in an optimal situation but things like turning iCloud off and on, having the user delete app data can all really muck things up and cause data loss or errors while syncing. There does not seem to be a great solution for some of these issues

* Its nearly impossible to foresee and plan for everything a user might do that could corrupt his/her database or break future syncs. At some point data loss is likely for at least a very small percentage of users

* iCloud takes a lot of time to code and especially test. That time could be better spent adding other features to the app or making new apps (I'm not as concerned about this

* Finally: Core Data over iCloud is just not ready for production yet and should be avoided

Please give me your opinions on these. Has anyone successfully used Core Data over iCloud in a production app and are happy with the results? It would be a GREAT feature for my app but stability and protection of data are very high priority for me.

**tl;dr**
I have an app that iCloud using Core Data would be perfect for

My app will need to list books that users have added to a database. Each book has data like its author


Right now I have the mechanics of adding and viewing the books complete through a local coredata setup


From poking around stackoverflow I see lots of talk on ruby on rails, webservices etc but that's all a bit foreign to me and I'm having trouble filtering it down to just what I need to focus on. I have a test box that I can use to setup whatever database server I need, but with all the options available, I don't know where to start.


I am thinking it goes along the lines of..
sqlite database on server that my app communicates to through REST. The main listing of books I need to populate my tableview is somehow downloaded from the server and saved locally into coredata. the tableview uses coredata to populate the table. when a user needs to add a book to the remote database

The idea was met with some enthusiasm by our directors, but it was quickly squashed by our IT department for money/resource reasons. My questions are: in theory, how difficult would it be to develop the appropriate app? What are we talking about money-wise?

I guess my question is what are generally considered the best systems to use to ensure that it can meet demand in case it sees some user growth

As far as the server software/language/database I'm assuming Apache/PHP/MySQL will be fine to use or will any one of those not scale well? I'm fairly confident PHP will work fine since most requests will just be a quick script that will check authentication and either pop a little data or write a little data out/to the database and exit. I'm mainly worried about the web server and database choice; I have experience with PHP/ASP.NET and MySQL/MSSQL (running on a mix of IIS and Apache) but it has been used for internal company applications with a comparably limited number of users so there was never any issues with speed.

The TL;DR of this would be that I'm considering purchasing and expanding a task manager/to-do list app.  Go ahead



The app as it exists is fully functional and has had a couple hundred downloads.  The design and UI are attractive and intuitive even though the font could use some love.






Here are the current features...

""Lite""  (The ""Pro"" version simply removes the limit on the number of tasks you can add)

**1. Add New Tasks**

You can add your new tasks in a daily
You can save the task to your iPhone calendar app
 
**2. Check the Done Tasks**

Can't remember if you finished your task? Just check it!
 
**3. Calendar View**

You can view your tasks in a calendar viewmode.
 
**4. Alarm**

You can set your alarm to every tasks.






First and foremost, which initially strikes me as high for such limited functionality, but I understand that it is basically a finished product from an aesthetic standpoint.  I'm viewing this as a solid foundation to build on.



Some features I would like to add include prioritization of tasks and automatic arrangement of high priority tasks over lower priority tasks by day, then share that on social media with a caption.  There are other ideas, but those two should be a good start.



So, ""fun"" project that leaves me with nothing in the end.  If I wanted that, I would spend $1,500 on playing golf.  Is this app overpriced (my gut instinct is yes)?  Could I pay a developer and designer less or a similar amount to build a comparable app from the ground up (my gut instinct is no)?  What would be a ballpark estimate for incorporating the two new features listed above?



I'm sure I will have follow-on questions

I am a long time apple user and will be finishing up my BS in electrical engineering this spring. I am currently working on a project for a design class and have some questions regarding Bluetooth Low Energy and how it is implemented in iOS (both 5 and 6).

First a bit of background about the project. We are designing a occupancy detection system for a building. The plan is to have BLE modules attached to walwarts throughout the entire building. These devices would communicate with a users smartphone and provide location information to a backend system. We want this system to require very little user interaction. Essentially they would download the app

I have done a bit of research and it sounds like all BLE control will be done via an app. I plan to build off of [TI's demo app](http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/Category:IPhone4SBLEDemo). 

My first questions is regarding how backgrounding works with BLE. I understand that there are two different backgrounding methods

Backgrounding Questions

1) Event or session backgrounding?

2) Does the backgrounding stay enabled indefinitely?

3) What happens when the phone is reset? Or if a restore is done (assuming the user backed up their apps)?

4) Can other apps disable the BLE functionality?

My next category of questions involves the central and peripheral roles. Our main goal is to limit power usage on the smartphone so that users will not be tempted to disable bluetooth. I believe this should be possible with either mode. 

Central or Peripheral

1) Do you see any benefits to having the iOS device being one over the other? 

2) Would it be better to have the iPhone send out an advertisement periodically or the BLE walwart device? 

Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!",,t5_2s61a,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/11ejt1/bluetooth_low_energy_ios_please_help/

Anyways... I've been following along using the ""Beginning iPhone 4 Development: Exploring the iOS SDK"" book from Apress. It's a good book (I have C++ and Java experience) but there's one example in the book that I'm toying with and I can't get it to work for the life of me. It compiles but bails at run time before even running the nib

Here's what it's supposed to do: As an example of having a different layout for portrait and landscape modes

It's showing the line of code that gives the problem being here:

self.window.rootViewController = self.viewController;

that line is in - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
which is in my AppDelegate .m file... 

This is the log of the error:

Unfortunately, it isn't exactly what I'm looking to do. In the app, you can add up to three guest users and have the app 'forget' them by clearing the slot, but it turns out that the user's information is not truly forgotten. If you click on an empty slot after forgetting a user, the web view dialog is skipped altogether and the former user is automatically added with no prompts.

Has anyone run into a similar issue? If so

**Update:**

Some further weirdness:

I thought that perhaps Safari was caching the Facebook cookies and that was why the user wasn't being prompted for a login. To test this theory, same issue. So this leads me to believe that something about the Facebook session is being stored in the App sandbox. 

Next I tried resetting NSUserDefaults before attempting a Facebook login. This had no effect

What else is going on here? Is the Facebook SDK storing the user information somewhere else? How do I go about actually closing their session and deleting all local data? 

**Update 2**

I'll start off by saying I'm very new to Objective-C and iOS development.  I was reading my development book while at my retail job

     So I'm working on learning iOS programming by working through tutorials I found online. I've gotten comfortable enough to start making a little trivia game to better familiarize with the language. It's working pretty well and the next step I want to implement is having the app pull the trivia questions from a database that I put online. 

Problem is I don't know where to start. I've been looking around for iOS and mySQL tutorials. But I don't know if mySQL is the right database to use.

So where do I start? I just want to host a database that has some questions and answers in it and my App should pull the information from online

1352123431.0,12nzzw,[Question] Is it possible to take multiple high quality photos in a row from a custom app?,cainunable,5,0,1,"In an app I am working on

The first way is using UIImagePickerController with SourceTypeCamera.  Using this method, and then clicks Use (or Retake).  The image is then queued up to upload and is also saved into the device's image gallery for later use.

The user also has the option to load up a gallery picker

So here is my question: Is there a better way to take multiple images in my app without the user needing to click the Use button each time (for a total of 3 clicks per picture.)  Ideally, and then just click the picture button and take as many pictures as you want in a row.  Maybe there is a setting to allow you to do this, but I haven't been able to find it, and in my search found other people who were asking for similar functionality.  I have found people who recommend streaming the video from the camera to the screen and basically taking a screen grab of the video, but they say this will obviously produce lower quality images, which sadly won't work in my situation.

Alternatively, if needed, the solution wouldn't even need to be app-store approvable.  Most of the working solutions I've seen for this seem to require a jail-broken phone to be able to launch applications from within other apps if the app to be launched doesn't accept URLs.

So

So I spent the past few months learning iOS Development and finally got my first app approved and up on the App Store. It is a cookbook style application. I'd love to get any suggestions or recommendations on how to improve it. Check it out!

https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/babalicious-mediterranean/id681298155?ls=1&amp;mt=8

It does some nifty stuff with Parse in the backend and automatically downloads new recipes every time I add them to the database

I wanted to outline some of the things that I learned building this app.

1. Third Party API's and libraries are awesome. Beginners shouldn't be afraid to search around for them and start implementing them. This project used Google's XML Parser, and Socialize for sharing and commenting features

For example if I have an

it's relatively simple to do

        unsigned char* strPtr = (unsigned char *) CFStringGetCStringPtr
            ((CFStringRef) str
        memset(strPtr

And I can do similar things for NSData.  But I would really like to have something more general.

I have looked into

* Zones
* Creating a parent class of NSObject and casting everything to that and keeping track of the memory regions.  This has just been a complete pain though.
* Encrypting the actual contents of the data and forcing a decrypt on access.  This gets back to the problem of knowing something about every single type.
* Encrypting then decrypting memory regions

1. Generate and store the month of data as an array then encapsulate and store that as another attribute of the current entity. 

2. Create a new Core Data entity and store the resulting month of data (28-31 individual ""days"" per ""Line"") with a relationship between each ""day"" and the corresponding line.

I'm not too worried about the creation/storing performance since there's a rather good chance that will happen on a server.

I currently work as a Crime Scene Specialist (field work for crime scenes) in a major city in the US. Due to accreditation requirements

Currently the notes are transcribed from handwritten notes taken on a notepad in the field into a Word document that's saved into LIMS (our Laboratory Information Management System). The new requirements say that we must keep our field notes as they are. This means that any handwritten notes must be scanned into the case notes in LIMS as they are taken. Of course

The problems that we're facing is that any corrections that come up (misspelled words, etc.) for handwritten notes would require that the notes page be printed out, corrected by hand, and scanned back into the system. We also see problems with the legibility of handwritten notes taken at a scene that may last several hours. Due to this, our management is interested in an electronic method of taking notes in the field that's time efficient, less cumbersome than a clipboard that would have to be carried around while photographing, and able to be edited in the case of corrections.

In an ideal world:
We would like to have a module-style form to input information. The way we would like that to work is to start with the basic information (case number, offense type, etc.) and be able to add other information. Other types of information would be things such as vehicle, detective, subject, processing types, general observations, ideally the information would be generated into a document containing only the added modules. Again

I realize that this could be incredibly complicated, the physical limitations means that an iPad wouldn't be very plausible either. An iPod touch would likely be the ideal device in terms of being able to carry the device on our person to be able to add any new details that come up.

SO, or would it just cause more problems than it would solve?

1372950047.0,1hmwu8,"Requesting feedback on my Non-IB view with viewcontroller ""pattern""",mugen_kanosei,1,0,2,"Hi all. I'm new to iOS programming and objc in general and am looking for feedback or best practices on Non-IB views with view controllers. I was trying to figure out the best practice for a UIView subclass to interact with its view controller in a low coupling way and this is what I've come up with.

MainView.h

    // MainView protocal to be implemented by the VC
    @protocol MainViewDelegate &lt;NSObject
        -(void)buttonOnePressed:(UIButton *)sender;
    @end
    
    @interface MainView : UIView
    @end

MainView.m

    @implementation MainView
    
    - (id)init
    {
        self = [super init];
        if (self)
        {
            [self createView];
        }
        return self;
    }

    - (void)createView
    {
        UIButton *buttonOne = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeRoundedRect];
        [buttonOne setTitle: @""Original Title""];
        [buttonOne addTarget: nil action: @selector(buttonOnePressed:) forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchUpInside];
        // add button to view and layout along with other controls

        SubView *subView = [SubView new];
        [self addSubView: subView]; // Add subview in
        // Layout subview in respect to main view
    }
    @end

MainViewController.m

    - (void)loadView
    {
        [self setView: [MainView new]];
    }
    
    - (void)buttonOnePressed: (UIButton *) sender
    {
        [sender setTitle: @""New Title""];
    }

The SubView.h and SubView.m files are created similarly and the MainViewController implements the MainViewDelegate protocol (that is a composite of its subviews protocols).

Here are my thoughts and reasoning's.
The MainViewDelegate is a composite of its immediate subviews delegates (and those in turn should be composites of THEIR immediate subviews delegates). This creates a composite protocol hierarchy that allows the view controller to only reference the top most protocol directly without having to list all the subview protocols.

By setting all controls targets to ""nil"" I can remove the need to have a custom initWithDelegate method (that the developer might forget to use) as the event will now go up the responder chain and get picked up by the MainViewController that should have implemented the delegate protocol. There might be a performance hit by letting the event bubble up the responder chain versus setting the target to a delegate property. I'm not sure how to test that. I may be over thinking the initWithDelegate though. If I have the controls targets set to use the delegate property, I still think that the initWithDelegate isn't ""required"" and reduces code in the MainView and SubViews by not having to implement it.

I created the view objects in init as that should be called no matter which constructor the developer uses.

I set the action method for the button to use UIButton as the ViewController should be aware of what type of control called and removes the requirement for casting in the case that it will be modifying it.

The one thing I have not figured out the best way for is for modifying controls that didn't initiate the action, I can list the UIControl properties that the ViewController should implement, and then the views handle the wireup in their initWithDelegate methods.

----------------------------------

I've actually been meaning to do a video on these techniques but at the same time I've been working on a massive rewrite of our app so my time has been very limited.  That and I discovered I suck at video editing.

First of all you have to understand what a storyboard is.  A storyboard is not just a single file that contains all the screens in your app.  I think this is what turns most people off of storyboards is that their app gets to cumbersome in this single storyboard approach.  Interface builder gets slow

Others shun nibs as well as storyboards and just write it all by hand.  I think this is also a bad idea.  Everybody writes code differently, and it keeps a bunch of unnecessary UI drawing code out of your app, and in a pace where it's easy to quickly get a good idea of what your app looks like.

I'll give you some tips below on some general storyboarding guidelines


**1: A storyboard per user story**

A rule thumb I usually follow is that I have one storyboard per user story.  In iOS apps, your story is probably too big and needs to be broken down further.  All a storyboard is, is a collection of NIBs stored in a single file.  This gives us some benefits such as being able to do a rough story implementation quickly to gauge how the screen flow is going to work, as well as see how all the screens relate to each other.  It also provides a nice encapsulation of a series of related screens.  So now the question is, how do we related storyboards together when we want to flow from one user story to another.  I'll get to that in a bit, but in a nutshell the ""leaf nodes"" of the storyboard usually will launch other storyboards or UI flows, or if you use my storyboard swizzle trick below the leaf nodes are actually the first scene of another storyboard.


**2: Merging storyboards isn't really that bad**

Storyboards are just XML files, if maybe another developer had to fix a bug.  If you do find multiple developers frequently bumping into each other in a storyboard, again, you probably have not properly broken down your user story.  I've been using storyboards in my app for the better part of a year, and I can count on one hand the number of times I've had a storyboard merge go badly enough that I had to revert to the common ancestor and rebuild.  And even in those cases, we hadn't diverged so far to make it impossible to recover.


**3: There are things you can do with storyboards that can't be done with nibs**

* Static tables make it easy to quickly layout some static data in table form.
* Container views with embed segues are an awesome way to make a single screen composed of multiple view controllers.  This is huge.


**4: Internationalization**

If you are using base internationalization, or git submodules, or another static lib project in the workspace).


**5: Segues**

These are just very cool.  These encapsulate the transition between screens.  You can create custom segues and make all kinds of creative custom screen transitions.  Unwind segues then make it practically a single click effort to navigate back to any arbitrary location in your storyboard flow without writing hardly any code.  I've had a blast with these as it makes these custom transitions easy for other developers to use.  InterfaceBuilder will recognize the segue name if you name it something like ""SuperSegue"" you will see the segue type ""super"" pop up in the dialog when you wire up two storyboard scenes.


**6: Just because you are using storyboards

Sometimes you have a view that will show up in multiple user stories.  A log in dialog is a good example.  Say your app allows users to use it without being authenticated, and then deleting the default view out of the storyboard scene.  When you do this, you will the controller class name in gray in the storyboard scene.  Then just create a modal segue to that login scene and you are practically done.


**So how do we connect storyboards?**

This is actually very simple.  I've created a little class that when I showed it to one of our interview candidates he was like, so that's what I'm calling it now.  I'll describe that more in detail below, but for now you don't really need to use it.  

So

    OtherViewController *otherStory = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@""OtherStoryboard"" bundle:nil] instantiateInitialViewController];
    [self.navigationController pushViewController:otherStory animated:YES];

That's it.  You could have easily have shown it as a modal


**Storyboard ""Swizzling""** (Editor: ugh

So a cool trick I've come up with (at least I think I did, or it will add the scene from the other storyboard as a child to itself.  It chooses which approach to use depending on the context. (e.g., in a modal dialog scenario, it uses the latter approach since there is no parent view controller).

So basically is the idea is when you are working on your storyboard, it will use the initial scene defined in that storyboard.

Here's the code:

[StoryboardSwizzleViewController.h](https://github.com/amccarri/StoryboardSwizzleDemo/blob/master/Storyboard%20Swizzle/StoryboardSwizzleViewController.h)
[StoryboardSwizzleViewController.m](https://github.com/amccarri/StoryboardSwizzleDemo/blob/master/Storyboard%20Swizzle/StoryboardSwizzleViewController.m)

And the containing parent project which you can download and see how it fits together:

So there ya go. I'm not sure if that answered your question

    static const CGFloat kAccessoryViewWidth = 18

This is all well and good, I need to restart the code/compile/debug cycle over again.  What if I didn’t need to?

I could externalize all of these pixel offsets, and most of the time I’ll still need to relaunch the app.  It’s also going to be difficult for me to do this outside of the simulator (Jailbreaking to access the file-system of my own apps, adding files to Documents/ via iTunes?).

Thus

    #ifdef DEBUG
        #define CONST_TUNABLE volatile
    #else
        #define CONST_TUNABLE const
    #endif // DEBUG

By marking the same variable “volatile” when compiling in the debug configuration, for instance.  This seems like a clear advantage, especially for apps that take a long time to load or require several steps to reach the same testing scenario.

Here’s an additional macro I find useful.  Often I need to define constant CGRect’s

I’m a professional Test Engineer currently working on automation testing and performance testing the backend servers (REST-API). I’m looking to expand my knowledge on iOS test automation on my free time, so I’m familiar with the platform. 

I already have a full-time job, so there might also be the time zone issue to consider. Anyway, if this sounds feasible, let me know. :) And more so if this can’t be done from a legal point of view. :D

Edit: To clarify, but that doesn't count with iOS. :)",,False,,t5_2s61a,1363524754.0,,

Can anybody enlighten me as to what that means?  I have got a build of my code running that is linked against the latest Facebook SDK. But now what?  Am I done?  If I call ""authorize"" I get shoved over to the Facebook login screen  - and this part works fine.  I just don't want that.  I am only integrating Facebook so that we can promote the app that way, I do not.

Anybody been down this path and know what the heck they're talking about?",,t5_2s61a,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/19qdlp/integrating_the_facebook_sdk/

I was hoping someone could help me. Does anyone know of a proxy service that would allow us to test our ios apps from a different country?
We currently have video content that has to be restricted to Canada only. We want to test this to make sure it works. 
Does anyone have any experience with geo testing ios apps?

Thanks

1361773857.0,196han,Question about developing an app on multiple Macs.,willup,3,1,20,"I'm currently building an app, I can't say I've been very organized throughout the process.

I've been doing all of the development from work, but I don't want to screw anything up, especially stuff pertaining to provisioning which has been my biggest headache thus far. I want to be able to work on the app from both my work Mac and my home one, but I'm not even sure where to begin.

I've looked all over Google, and haven't found much that directly answers this question. Maybe what I want I do is not possible, but I'd love to know the easiest way if there is one. I'm afraid I may also need to relocate all of the images in my app into Dropbox or something, which I'm pretty sure would require me to remove them from the project and put them back in. In retrospect, I wish I had put them all in one folder instead of scattering them throughout my file system and desktop...
