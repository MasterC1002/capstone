**edit:** because this might seem overly confusing, this is all you really need:

From now on

Title

as in: 

'Uncle Sam Wants You'

                  -or-                  

'Uncle Sam Wants You'

                 -or-

'Uncle Sam Wants You', WWI]

* the [Cause] tags can be between one and three of the 120 that are listed in the tables below

* Plus they need a link flair added after you post

Here is what an example would look like after having link flair added to it:

[United States] 'Uncle Sam Wants You'

----------------
Now on with the very detailed explanation:

I tried with this yesterday

Welcome to all the new subscribers, but if you ever submit here please read this.

First off

From the beginning this subreddit has asked that submission titles remain neutral and informative

However, and these types of titles are being used here more frequently, sometimes several times a day and this subreddit is becoming increasingly difficult to moderate effectively.

We have not had an exact set of rules to follow

We would like this subreddit to remain searchable, so we are going to have a stricter and more standardized set of rules.

We are going to use /u/Deimorz's bot /u/AutoModerator to remove submissions that do not match an exact title format.

This is what it looks like now

--------

#Rules for Submissions

##Link Formatting

Submission titles *MUST* use this format:

Title, or Medium]

Example:

""Uncle Sam Wants You!"" by Montgomery Flagg

* Title can include creator, and/or description.

* Date can be ####, or XXXX-era  

* One, just make sure to separate them by commas.  

* Tags in the [Cause] bracket can be preceded with pro- or anti-

* Link flair is added after submitting

Also, be re-hosted on a reliable image host, and AutoModerator is also going to help enforce this.
