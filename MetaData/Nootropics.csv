I am pretty sure I have been brainwashed by TV-series such as House MD, so to speak. When I am reading a book for instance, I have this idea that I should be coming up with lots of associations to what I am reading, and also be seeing the scenes that are depicted extremely vividly. So when I am reading and everything is going extremely slow, and I don't sense any sparks flying, I just kind of lose interest or get fed up, and go look at the computer instead. At least there, so I don't have to use my (in my perception) underdeveloped imagination.

Please give me the no-bullshit

I have a feeling that because I was praised for my intelligence, and thus ending up in a perpetual loop of self-defeat. (I seem to remember that these thoughts are supported by psychology research in deliberate practice and growth vs. limited mindset on intelligence). But maybe this idea is an inhibitory one as well... Astonishes me how I can come up with tons of ideas as to ""Why I am stupid"".

It would be interesting to see your guys definition of intelligence, through exercise or through psychotropic substances, but in either case, what do you guys think about these issues? 

Thank you.

2) Little to no negative side effects

3) Fairly easy to obtain (at worst

4) Fairly cheap per dosage.

5) Short time between first take and effects benefit (1 week max)

The following are the drugs I consider to be in the above category.  I am including several non-nootropic supplements because of their significance as well.

**Modafinil**

The big boss of all nootropics.  As everyone has said, but you don't spend more than $1 a day, for massively increased workflow.

**Piracetam/Choline**

The other big boss of nootropics.  Makes you sharper, can get it from amazon.  Tastes nasty, but be a man.

**L-Theanine**

Underrated.  Like shotgunning a green tea.  I use it as sort of a substitute for aspirin

**Caffeine**

In pill form it's unbeatable.  Great for preworkout and in general.  Fuck coffee and its calories.

**Ephedrine**

This one is tricky.  I don't think I know how to use it well.  It does make me not hungry for a few hours

**Creatine**

Workout staple

**Beta - Alanine**

A primary ingredient in Jack3D (which I consider to be a really expensive cocktail of caffeine and beta alanine).  Basically removes muscle fatigue.  Much better for lifting than running.

1362091696.0,19fb9t,Reddit Placebo Blinded Racetam Study,MisterYouAreSoDumb,138,13,167,"Well the time has finally come. My curiosity has finally expanded to real world effectiveness

This is going to be the first study in a series. Depending on how well this one goes, racetams.

The study is going to consist of 20 Redditors. Selection of the participants is going to be a little complex, and how familiar they consider themselves with them. They are also going to have to take all of the free [Cambridge Science](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) tests, and send me their results. I will not make public what I am looking for in a participant until after the study has concluded. I want this to be as blinded as I possibly can.

There will be a cost associated with this study. I am donating my time for free, and shipping. Right now I think it's going to be $20 per person. I am currently ordering the capsules and capsuling equipment that will be used to create the 800 or so capsules needed for the study. I am going to use flavored, non-see-through capsules to mask the ingredients inside. I am also going to use inert masking agents in each of the capsules, as well as for the placebo control. I know that I would be able to tell aniracetam from piracetam just by looking at the capsules, and I assume many of you could as well. I want to avoid any chance that my blinding will not be effective.

It is looking like it will be a 10 day study, or in what dosing schedules I will use them. Each participant will receive a package with individually marked bags corresponding to the days of the trial. They will take two pills from the bag in the morning, then the last two at mid day. They will have a spreadsheet that I have created that will allow them to track not only their subjective opinion of their mood, energy level, anxiety, and focus; but they will also take each of the Cambridge Science assessments every day to objectively test any improvements. I need some opinions on which tests would be best. Perhaps we use all of them, perhaps only a few. It's going to be somewhat time intensive for the participants

Nobody will know which racetams were used, it must be consistent with each person in the study. There is also going to be a washout period. The participants are going to need to refrain from using any nootropics for at least a week. Then you will take your baseline Cambridge Science tests. If this is not done, our data will not be accurate. We want to control as many variables as possible, so that we do not have anything clouding the data. We want consistent dosing schedules, consistent testing times, and congruency among all the participants. The better prepared we are, the better our data will be.

I am going to need some help from those that are more familiar with statistics. Any volunteers would be appreciated. Anyone familiar with standard testing procedures would be good to speak to as well. I want to make sure I am not missing something that will lead to inconsistent data.

We are going to be looking for acute effects. Each dosing schedule is not going to be long enough to build up the substance. This is by design. We are also going to be testing a bunch of different things. One of which is the accuracy of subjective perception. Do you guys know how to differentiate active from placebo, I believe this study is going to give us some really good data with all the controls we will be implementing. There are a lot of variables, and I hope I have come up with ways to control for them. Anyone that is good with that sort of thing, and wants to be sworn to secrecy about what we are doing until after the study is done, message me and I can get you involved. I want to limit exposure of our methods as much as possible, but I am going to need some help.

Lastly, and sent out the racetams I requested almost instantly. Thank you to them!

1365209698.0,1brrgp,The Case For Long Term Gradual Effect Nootropics,nicolaosq,126,17,63,"When most people think of nootropics

The effects of drugs like piracetam, and caffeine are great, but seem to have an effect (almost exclusively) on receptors and neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, dopamine, and gaba. Such has previously been the case as well for drugs that treat mood and attention disorders. People are given SSRIs to increase the amount of serotonin in the synapse. Children are given Adderall to increase the amount of dopamine, among other neurotransmitters. These drugs are created to address short term issues. Again, I'm not disputing the efficacy, once your brain chemistry is maxed, ect and then you can improve on the effects to form new habits and behaviors. That is certainly true. However

In order to make any significant, nutrients, growth factors, and nootropics that physically add to or fix the structure of the brain to increase efficiency and possibly raise IQ and intelligence.  Now, this can be an extremely slippery slope when looking at the potential problems of fibrosis, overgrowth and the dangers of brain cancer as well as addressing the pruning issue. Experiments must be done (on ourselves?) to expand this new frontier in science.



In order to delineate between the short term biochemical effects I will call these drugs ""nootropic uppers"". And I will call the longterm structure changing drugs

Here are some examples of nootropic uppers:

Precursors, Reuptake inhibitors and enhancers, Agonists - Examples:

Racetams, Stimulants, GABA blockers, Glutamate activators, Serotonergics, adaptogenic.



Then we have the ""nootropic benders""

Here are some examples of nootropic benders:

Nerve growth stimulation (BDNF &amp; NGF), stimulating dendrite growth, neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes and Gliogenesis   - Examples:

--------------------------------

ALCAR - Dendrite growth

Sominone - Enhances neurite outgrowth and spatial memory mediated by the neurotrophic factor receptor

Royal Jelly (Royalactin) - Gliogenesis, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes.  [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15849420) and [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10579223)

Hydergine - Inhibits apoptosis

Gotu Kola - Repairing neurons &amp; growth of dendrites [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2686623/) and [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16105244)

Noopept - BDNF

Somatostatin - Enhances nerve growth factor-induced neurite outgrowth [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7955338)

Lions Mane - NGF

Phosphatidylserine - myelination [here](http://www.hyperhealth.com/demo/phosphatidylserine.htm)

Pregnenolone - increases neurogenesis [here](http://www.mendeley.com/catalog/pregnenolone-sulfate-enhances-neurogenesis-psa-ncam-young-aged-hippocampus/)

-----------------------------------------

I encourage members and nootropic users to think about the difference between these 2 types of nootropics. These drugs (benders) must be researched and experimented by us because companies are not interested in long term non-immediate effects. If you don't feel the effects right away it may mean the drug and its actions are building up to create a compounding longterm effect.",,t5_2r81c,1365210858.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1brrgp/the_case_for_long_term_gradual_effect_nootropics/

Just note that a lot of this is anecdotal. Your mileage may vary. If you think I wrote something horribly stupid

Some things to keep into consideration:

- Everyone expierences racetams differently, others will get lazy. Trial and error is the key.

- Racetams influence your cholinergic system --&gt; brain consumes more acetylcholine (ACh). If you have a very effecient brain, you could expierence mild depression.

- I recommend taking everything on an empty stomach, unless in a hurry.

- Some people feel nauseous when taking both racetams and choline sources together on an empty stomach. If this is the case for you

- I recommend everyone when starting supplementation, 3600mg the next 4 days. Attack doses are ""to make to body used to the piracetam"", an unknown substance to the body. I'm not sure if it's necessary, but I did so either way to be sure. When you have taken piracetam before, and continue usage, attack dosing is no longer necessary.
The first 2 weeks

When taking various racetams at the same time

I recommend everything in powder form if possible. You can get used to any bad taste eventually, I buy fat soluble solutions in pill form. You could perfectly place powder at the back of your tong (taste less) and swallow down with some water, though.

Now: anecdotal expierences on the different racetams

Fish oil: fish oil is said to be very healthy for the brain, I only take this much during cramming/finals. To combine with fat soluble racetams, I take 1 to 2 150mg EPA caps.

Choline: there's lots of different choline solutions. Bitartrate is the cheapest, in a ""best of both worlds"" approach. I avoid taking more CDP choline later in the day; if I need more choline I take alpha GPC.

Alpha GPC and CDP choline have their own influences on your cognition and mood/motivation (subtle, could be useful for insomniacs. I also noticed increased libido while on Alpha GPC. Nothing major, but it's noticeable.

Another viable choline solution is ALCAR, but what made me suspicious of ALCAR is that the person that had the neck tension (longecity post somewhere) took a normal ALCAR dose, and had this neck pain for a while *after* supplementation. I'd rather not.

Finally

**Piracetam**: the most affordable racetam
Makes me **feel sharper, but it makes me concious and guilty of being lazy.

Most importantly

As a chronic tinnitus sufferer, attached to the noise. I notice when I'm on piracetam, and when I'm not taking piracetam. It definitely helps me cope.

Either way, especially for further potentiating the other racetams.

Half-life is pretty long

**Aniracetam**: I have only just been taking aniracetam. The first time I took it, but you don't feel stressed out), and on top of that **MOTIVATES ME to get things done**. Other's say that the anxiolytic effect of aniracetam makes them lazy.  It's also said to make you
**more attentive/sharper**, it's said to mildly make you **more fluent in conversation**.

Half-life is 1-1.5 hours

**Oxiracetam and pramiracetam**: personally, even in its required smaller doses, so if oxiracetam works, I recommend sticking with that. I personally HATED oxiracetam, it made me hypomanic and useless. **Pramiracetam motivates me** similar to aniractam (oxi doesn't at all) **and makes me think clearer**, but has its side effects (mildly blunted emotions as mentioned before, but I also seem to have a bit of a crash when stopping supplementation of prami). Recommended as an (expensive) drug to be taken when cramming / during finals.

Half-life for both should be about as long as piracetam, multiple smaller doses spread throughout the day would be recommended.

Finally

- Even if a drug has motivating abilities

- I personally never take more than two racetams at the same time (I start to feel weird and feel jittery

- When importing, iherb, ... other options are nootropichub or intellimeds (both sent from UK) to have quick EU deliveries; ""boostmygrade"" (US) is a somewhat more expensive option, but offers combo pills. Cerebral health (US) also has combo pills (Synaptine brand).

- I do not drink alcohol when on any racetam. I once did, but with the vision impairment and slower reflexes). This may vary with other people, but I don't think it's healthy for your brain to do so either way.

- These substances are all pretty harmless on short term intake, and consult a doctor whenever something suspicious is going on***.",,False,,t5_2r81c,True,,

Also

I know modafinil has controversy. As many people report some type of success with it

Here is what I decided to do:

-Take 150mg armodafinil daily on wake until tolerance set in or 30 days straight. Why? Because many people claim high

***Note: I am using the word modafinil instead of armodafinil because it would appear they have extremely similar effects and modafinil is 50% armodafinil. I have not taken adrafinil or modafinil. Modafinil is way more popular than armodafinil so I'm going to refer to it as modafinil.  

***Note: I have been using oxiracetam 1g a day on and off for the past 3 years

***Note: I have ingested zero other drugs besides oxiracetam during this time period described

For the effect

Here is what happened:

Increased awareness of visual environment

Increased focus

Increased visualization

Increased thought speed

Increased reading comprehension

The weird thing is

Bad Side Effects:
-Lower hunger
-Takes longer to get to sleep

I expected crashes to happen, it DOES NOT HAPPEN. There are no crashes, no irritability, no feeling effects wearing off.  

One key difference is that I did not care about cutting down sleep. I have slept 8 to 9 hours each night

Before

Anyway

I have been an introvert internally my whole life. I do not have aspergers, and succeeded. I have 5 best friends and 50~ people in my social circle, and actively like to go socialize. I notice many people more introverted than me and many people more extroverted. But I need to 'recharge' and have alone time which is typical of introverts. Introverts I have asked told me I appear to be an extrovert, and extroverts recognize I am more quiet.  

After the 2nd week of modafinil, I don't really know.  

I never increased the dose at all from 150mg armodafinil a day

After I started noticing how witty I have become

-All sorts of random friends
-20 person friend group
-10 person friend newish group
-Joined a brand new 8 person group on a community meetup site to test with new people

I had to make sure I wasn't delusional and that I was actually gaining some sort of charisma ability. I have done similar tests before without any drugs and well

After 4 days I had personal proof that this made a dramatic change in my personality for the better. I went from just being someone in a group, and I started getting lots of direct eye contacts with everyone. I was genuinely making people really happy and making them laugh.  

This is making me sound like I used to be the most boring person in the word

It would appear, and spreading unlimited feelings of happiness. When I say happiness, I don't mean I am happier, it is that I can make people FEEL happiness much more often by simply talking with them.  

It is truly breathtaking, I genuinely care about everything they say, I create elaborate jokes and discussions about anything. I get everyone excited about any topic. I gauge what each person is like and tailor my communication to them and the group. I just started KNOWING all these things and doing them AUTOMATICALLY. The key here is these abilities just started to automatically appear out of no where after I started taking modafinil. It's like I am a con man with no con.  

I have read similar stories for street drugs, CRASH. But there is no crash. There is no wide eyed drug addict effect going on. I am relaxed, and have drive. It is a constant effect. I am completely calm, yet have complete control to do anything I would like to do. I haven't taken any risks that put me in any danger, in fact I feel much safer as I am more aware of everything in the environment. I don't feel like a cracked out meth head at all, everything is clear, and I keep watching for warning signs constantly. The only crash is the everyday crash everyone has

As you can see from the length of this post, that is just being a normal being. Normal humans don't talk or write forever.  

So as of now

Going into this I expected there might be withdrawal

So after 30 days I stopped taking it, 90% effect. All my abilities are still here. I'm still a top 10% extrovert. I still have all the increased mental abilities.  

Today was day 6

Anyway I have decided to stop taking it for 30 days to further test what happens in withdrawal

Explanations:

-I have some unknown disease. Considering I have a clean bill of health both physically and mentally, can you give me some narcolepsy drugs to test?"" they would put me on some drug abusers list. ""No doctor, I need to be the life of the party! The extrovert of extroverts!"" Hah.  

-This is all placebo. I have taken many nootropics in the past as a hobby and to increase general health. Most have no perceived effects so I eventually stop taking them. I would love for any other nootropic than a schedule 4 drug to unlock all these abilities automatically. Considering most people seem to become more introverted on modafinil

-I'm destroying my dopamine/norepinephrine receptors. I don't know

-I'm delusional. Considering the amount of work I accomplish and genuine happiness that people show when talking to me

-I read some book that inspired me. Nope

-I'm trying to sell modafinil. As I said before

For little proof, and my opinion still stands:  

""I will counter by proposing a theory that brain performance drugs may increase awareness, therefore allowing more connections between neurons to be formed. If I define creativity as a connection between two ideas to make another idea, and the biological basis for this is more neural connections, and if brain performance drugs increase neural connections, I would say that brain performance drugs increase creativity. But like this article, I have no scientific evidence for this because no scientific experiments have been developed yet that I know of that can accurately test the vague notion of ""creativity."" Disclaimer: This post was made using brain performance drugs.""  

Little did I know

The reason why I don't normally post on this account is that I don't want anyone that I know in real life to see a post like this and then think I am a drug abuser as the public is very misinformed.  

**The reason for making this now enormous post

-Have you gotten increased social abilities from modafinil?

-Have you gotten decreased social abilities from modafinil?

-Have you taken modafinil 30+ days in a row and what happened?

-Do you experience no tolerance to modafinil?

-Have you been taking modafinil consistently for 1+ year and gained social abilities you haven't had before?

-Have you experienced any bad withdrawal effects from modafinil use?

-Have you tried taking modafinil without sacrificing sleep as these effects were only attained by me sleeping normally?

We are still getting stack advice posts and thats to be expected


If someone has either not read the FAQ properly and is unwilling to do the research themselves then it scares me a bit. The fact the some people seem to think asking a bunch of internet people about putting a active chemical into their body without knowing all the risks and information is a smart thing to do. Should we be reporting and deleting these posts on sight?

The other type has read the FAQ and for some reason believes they are above the rules of this subreddit and still posts knowingly- do we really want to reward this behavior? Thereby encouraging it. 

This is a grey area of reddit and giving stack advice could be considered as medical advice thereby violating reddits terms of service (I may have been guilty of this at times!). For this reason especially I think we need to keep stack advice out of this sub completely cause if someone comes along and decides it does violate the TOS and clicks open this sub and sees 3 or 4 stack advice posts with replies then we could get banned. I would prefer to lose stackadvice than stackadvice and nootropics together. We can always create /r/ninjastackadvice ;)

moral of the story: some of the molecules discussed in this forum **can get you killed**. The side-bar absolutely needs something more immediate than ""please read the FAQ before posting questions"". It needs to have a massive warning.

\* Actually, whole bibles on how not to fuck up, outlining the many shades and categories of subtlety. This is notably lacking for the plants I was eating. Perhaps this reflects the observable bias/tendency of this forum in general towards the prescription, modern-industrial-pharmaceutical, methods? Could it be that in trying to bridge the gap between ourselves and nature, we realize only how wide that gap has become in time, and deep in ignorance? We have the availability of shamanic herbs and plants, nor the cultural systems in place to transmit that knowledge or install it as a gate-keeper into the realms of availability.

One of the reasons we do what we [edit: lm] do is because we deeply believe in the value of freedom.

We believe that human freedom is meaningless if it does not include freedom of information.  And we believe that freedom of information is rooted in freedom of thought.  And we believe that freedom of thought is not truly freedom if it does not encompass full cognitive liberty.

We champion freely sharing information and exercising freedom of thought.  

One of the most important reasons we [edit: lm] sell nootropic materials is because we believe in cognitive liberty.  

We believe that every person has the right to do with their own body and mind what they choose.  

There are no freedoms more fundamental than these.

But we also believe that this freedom is inseparably bound with responsibility.

We intend to sell nootropic materials to careful

If we become explicitly aware that a specific purchaser is using our nootropic materials in a manner other than their intended use

If this happens often

We would not do this because we acquiesce to the idea that people should be banned by some authority from doing what they choose with their own body and mind

Instead, responsible and qualified adult researchers can be endangered by their ""misuse"".  One person's actions can affect many.

It is an unchanging reality of life that authorities will always seek, and finding ways to protect people from those dangers.

Widespread misuse of nootropic materials in a manner other than their intended purpose may very well result in exacerbating FDA intervention

Governments love it when people given free rein don't behave like responsible adults

How can one feel entitled to control ones self

Freedom is tied to responsibility.  Freedom IS responsibility.  We cannot have one

We respectfully ask all nootropics researchers to take this into consideration.

[–]AnAlien 2 points 7 days ago
My 16 day old armodafinil order still has not shipped. It's been 6 days since Nathaniel says all outstanding orders were cleared yet there is no evidence of that.
I submitted a support ticket about this 2 days ago and received a completely contradictory response basically saying that nothing has changed and they are still waiting on their suppliers
There are still strikes occurring and no tracking has been received. We're not the ones to blame in this equation. The supplier we use is being a bit slow on things. Hopefully this can be resolved soon.
How can these two statements be reconciled? Why don't they put a notice on their website about the current status of this situation? (they still only say to expect a 3-5 day delay). Why haven't they keep us updated on the situation through Twitter? They haven't had anything to say there for 2 weeks.
I'm trying to be understanding about this but this type of behavior is not the way to reassure customers.

[–]Ampamet 2 points 1 hour ago
I can report a similar experience with BTCNootropics. I made an order on 7/1, aside from a reply to a support ticket I sent on 7/9. The reply simply said ""There are delays with all orders, you can blame us if you require, we are trying our hardest to get things moving but we've not received tracking for many orders"", which tells me nothing. I just sent them another ticket to cancel my order if it can't be shipped next week.

I honestly don't think they're trying to scam anyone. Rather, and don't know how to scale quickly. And in fairness, scaling quickly is notoriously hard. People like to say that it's ""a good problem to have"", but it's not. It's just a problem, and a hard one at that.

1358378026.0,16pqiu,Seven weeks on Modafinil,TheseThingsMatter,68,12,41,"Just finished up my first 40 pack of Modafinil and thought I'd write up my experiences.

I ordered from mymodafinil.com/net to Australia. Delivery in around 9 days. No issues at customs

I took one pill of 200mg most days. Some days I lowered the dose to 100mg or skipped.

The first week side effects were most noticeable. Over the first few days I got a headache about 5-6 hours after taking. On the second day I felt zoned out at the end of the day. After the first week those side effects went completely.

**Mental Effects**

Um, it was nothing like that. Subtle is the word.

On the first day I did have a bit of tunnel vision. Like I got out the pool and went to the changing rooms but forgot I had left my towel at the side and had to go back for it. Or I'd be writing code and look up and there is a cold cup of tea beside me that I had completely forgotten was there because I had so much focus.

This lessened after a while.

Overall I'd say I did absolutely nothing that I couldn't have done anyway but looking back over the day you do seem to get more done. Things you've written get a few hundred more words (which can be good and bad)

It's subtle but not crazy huge.

Oh

**Sleep and Alertness**

I always take in the morning and have no problems sleeping. If I compare to days when there is no modafinil in my system I would say any time I have lacked sleep has had less of an effect.

For instance

**Biggest Change**

The biggest change for me

Since starting I have less desire to eat unhealthily and more desire to workout. It really is astounding.

I haven't had any junk food at all apart from dessert at holiday events. I've eaten a much healthier diet overall including lots of veg. I've worked out at least five days a week. 

It's like my sweet tooth is gone. I just don't crave those things and it's easier for me to plan to eat healthily.

I wasn't particularly overweight to start with but over the past seven weeks I've lost fat and gained muscle. It's cool. Unlike previous times when I've been on a health kick it seems effortless. I feel like it could go on forever and that I'm not depriving myself.

**Alcohol**

I seem to be able to drink more sensibly. I binge drink a lot less. I can have two and stop. This was a minor issue for me and it's been cool to not have hangovers.

**Biggest Problem**

My biggest issue is... my girlfriend. She, do myself harm and that I'm listening to nonsense on the internet.

I take her points on board and do consider everything she says but I'm happy to take the small risk. It does cause friction between us and I just try to not talk about it. Which is a shame as I have lots to say and it's been a very positive experience.

** End Note

As always the placebo effect could be a huge part of this... but well it is what it is.

I started becoming weary of my caffeine consumption and decided to completely cut soda from my diet. I've seen the price of caffeine powder online and figured it would save me a lot of money and I could cut out the calories and excess sugars that came from drinking soda.

1371577133.0,1glhwd,First week on Aniracetam. A changed man.,simplicitea,62,9,64,"Hey Reddit.


I wanted to share with you my experience with Aniracetam having taken it for a week.  I am roughly taking about 750 mg each dose along with 500 mg of Choline and about 1000mg of fish oil.  I take one dose in the morning and one dose in the late afternoon.


Upon taking it the first day, I can quite confidently say that it was a feeling of mental clarity (and quite profound I might add).  I was no longer distracted as much with worrysome thoughts and stresses in my life.  Overall my anxieties  were tangibly reduced which was a huge benefit for me.   That first night I felt incredibly motivated and had a bit of a revelation of sorts regarding my life.  It was quite a profound experience which I think was largely due to my mind being free of all the clutter that would normally bog me down.  I was very focused and my ability to concentrate was greatly improved.   At night, I did feel a bit wound up and discovered it was a bit harder to fall asleep.  


The next day provided much of the same effects, the increased focus and the reduced anxiety lasted pretty much all day.  A note about the anxiety.  I feel as though I am able to tolerate a lot more stress along with other things that would normally make me quite anxious.  For example, socialzing felt a lot easier to me and for someone who is quite introverted and shy, this was a great plus.  In general, I just feel a lot more tolerant to things i usually have a hard time with.  


The following day


The next few days provided me with very much of the same.  Increased mental clarifty, a clear direction on various things in my life and a general sense of things feeling ""right"".  I can honestly say that I've never felt so good before.  I will say however that I don't believe that the aniracetam has enhanced anything per se.  It's more that I feel like it has brought me back up to a normal healthier baseline (from which I was severly below before).  I feel like I am a much more positive person as a result.


TL;DR - Aniracetam has severly reduced my anxiety

A [Google search](http://www.google.com/?q=modafinil+tolerance) for ""modafinil tolerance"" produces many dozens of blog posts

However

As a practical matter

**Is this tolerance effect real? If so

At this point

I hypothesise several explanations for this discrepancy:

1. The anecdotal reports are incorrect

2. The anecdotal reports refer to different dosing regimes

3. Tolerance is only built to certain effects (nootropic) which were not examined in clinical studies as they are irrelevant to its prescribed indication (narcolepsy, etc.)

4. Observed tolerance is due to interaction with other drugs in the nootropic ""stack""

5. Tolerance effects have been missed in clinical studies

6. Tolerance is due to sleep deprivation with Modafinil being used as a replacement for sleep

I found two major reviews of Modafinil in the literature:

**[A Systematic Review of Modafinil - Journal of Clinical Psychiatry (2006)](http://www.josephmatta.com/modafinil.pdf)**

This review is aimed at clinical psychiatrists and does not make any mention of long-term tolerance. If tolerance were mentioned in the literature

**[Modafinil: A Review of Neurochemical Actions and Effects on Cognition; Minzenberg

This is a comprehensive review

* ""Major pharmacokinetic parameters are independent of doses in the range 200-600 mg/day""

* ""Elimination occurs primarily in the liver

* ""Exerts a [small] but concentration-dependent induction of CYP 1A2

* CYP3A4 induction produces a significant interaction with ehinylestradiol and triazolam [(Robertson et al

* Does not affect the spontaneous release of dopamine from mouse striatal synaptosomes

* DAT knockout mice do not experience waking effect

* ""...have found modafinil to have long-term efficacy for sleepiness extending for as long as 136 weeks, 1996; Hirshkowitz et al, 2006; Mitler et al, 2000)""

* Directly binds to dopamine and noradrenaline transporters with ""modest potency""

* Produces significantly elevated extracellular dopamine, hyaluronan, glutamate and decreased GABA

* Elevated Dopamine

* Does not stimulate the release of dopamine from synaptic vesicles or turnover in the caudate nucleus

**[Long-term efficacy and safety of modafinil (PROVIGIL®) for the treatment of excessive daytime sleepiness associated with narcolepsy (2000)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945700000319)**

This is the Mitler et al cited in Minzenberg et al

**Discussion: Pharmacokinetic Tolerance**

Tolerance could be caused by an increase in elimination rate after long-term use. This would produce a shorter half-life and increase the first-pass effect

Apparently, 2002)](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf) lends credibility to this. Of note, too, is that [Robertson et al, 2002](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf) discovered a stronger induction in intestinal than hepatic CYP3A4.

On the other hand

Overall, tolerance could be reversed by supplementation with a CYP3A4 inhibitor such as bergamottin (grapefruit juice) or milk thistle. Alternatively, [Robertson et al](http://www.nature.com/clpt/journal/v71/n1/pdf/clpt20027a.pdf) discovered a stronger induction in intestinal than hepatic CYP3A4. If sublingual bioavailability is sufficient, it could bypass both intestinal breakdown and the first-pass effect.

On a side note

**Discussion: Pharmacodynamic Tolerance**

Despite its dopaminergic effects

Beyond this

If you have any insignt into possible tolerance mechanisms in GABA/glutamate

**Conclusion**

Above

1. It remains possible the anecdotal reports of tolerance are incorrect or inaccurate. Though the number of reports (Google it for yourself!) makes this is unlikely.

2. Doses typical for nootropic effects (50-200mg/day) are at or below those observed in clinical studies to be well-tolerated for long periods of time.

3. Tolerance specific to nootropic effects remains a possibility. But anecdotal reports include a cessation of eugeroic effects.

4. I couldn't find any interactions that could explain the discrepancy.

5. Clinical studies missing the tolerance entirely remains a very real possibility

6. Sleep deprivation is a likely explanation. Many of the anecdotal reports concern people who have used Modafinil to go for long periods of time with little or no sleep.

The CYP3A4 feedback is the only substantive tolerance mechanism I have found, but it is unknown if it would otherwise reduce tolerance. This should be straightforward to experimentally test.

**If you have any suggestions, please tell me. I'm interested both for academic and pragmatic reasons.**

DISCLAIMER: Do not take my blunder as grounds to replicate. I acknowledge that there may be long-term consequences in this, safe or not, don't be like me.


I'll cut to the chase: I took somwhere between 1.5 grams to 3.0 grams of noopept today. Fuck me, free of charge, no questions asked. Excellent service, containers sealed, neat, perfect. Nothing but good things there. I also received a much larger jar of aniracetam. The shipment came with two scoopers, a larger one for the aniracetam (.6 to 1.1 grams, I didn't even notice it was a ""scooper"" at all. I thought it was some kind of weird instrument that smartdrug people use, took a quick look, like a fucking imbecile


After the third scoop, balls, shit, fuck, etc. Three more classes in front of me and a good chance I'd need to be hospitalized by lunch. Or so I thought. After the initial wave of panic wore off, I took an inventory of my physical and mental state and realized that I was fine. I took a long walk at break, calmed down, no anxiety


I've had some limited experience with ratecams and other nootrpics. Currently I teach full-time and I'm in a demanding grad school program, and today's effects are basically on par with what I've experienced at my highest doses of 50-60 mg in the past: alertness, vivid colors, smoother cognition, sense of well-being, etc. Today I was pretty drowsy after school, but, on par with what I experienced in the initial phases of my last cycle. I slept for about 3 hours (a very long nap for me) and had incredibly vivid, not even a headache (I took another alpha gpc). I do feel alert and music is more interesting than usual


What does this mean? Well, this should further support the relative safety of noopept (at least in the short term). Maybe the body can only process so much (making mega-dosing unnecessary)? I don't know, just speculating. I have no expertise in this area whatsoever, so it would be cool if some of reddit's experts could weigh in. It would also be good to know if I'm in any mortal danger. At the very least, today's inconceivable mishap might be able to shed some light on our understanding of this mysterious compound. If I don't make it through the night tell the world my story.

**DO NOT** buy it right now. The people on longecity is having a group buy and will recieve and start testing it in a few weeks. You'll waste money (if it doesn't work) and possibly expose yourself to danger. Just be patient and we'll find out soon.

**Background**

There have been a few discussions on the internet about PRL-8-53

**Mechanism of Action**

Due to the drug being about 40 years old


&gt;“Meets structural criteria required for interaction with cholinergic response in the experimental animal. The compound potentiates dopamine and causes partial inhibition of serotonin.”


1.	PRL-8-53s main mechanism of action seems to be by using the cholinergic system. This has been confirmed in test animals. An article however mentions ""making the brain more responsive to acetylcholine""


2.	It potentiates dopamine



3.	Partially inhibits serotonin (inhibits the transportation of serotonin is my guess). The study then claims that a reduction in serotonergic activity benefits the experimental animal and refers to two studies (Tenen, I have not been able to find the full studies on them. 
He writes that the changes in neurotransmitters (more dopamine

**Benefits**

The study that was done looked at memory of words. The volunteers took a placebo or PRL-8-53 2-2.5 h before the test was conducted. 12 one-syllable, overall (all the results together) PRL-8-53 produced a statistical significant result with a p-value of 0.02. but not in the high performance group. Those who were older than 30 responded better than the younger part. 

Actual increase instead of just p-value:

http://i.imgur.com/cvywEIS.png - Population 1A

http://i.imgur.com/nTgW7xO.png - Population 1B

http://i.imgur.com/lI4LexS.png - Population 1C

http://i.imgur.com/rEmIPI8.png - Population 1D

Gross Score = Number of words recalled.

Discrete Score = Number of words recalled in correct order.

There was also a test on motor control. The method used was that the volunteers had to fit a stylus three times in a row into seven holes (which gradually got smaller and smaller). If the stylus touched the side of the holes

A visual reaction test was used too

Another test where the subjects had to remove seven, add two, remove seven, add three (then start with removing one again) from a specific number is also claimed to have been done, I have not seen any study on it though. 

There are some claims that are not proven in any studies

The patent says 

&gt;""Additionally

The claim about it being a spasmolytic agent might not be correct if the motor control test failed. (This is my own speculation

**Dosage**

In the only study I've found, so bigger dosages might work.

The patent does say that the oral dosages range from 0.01-4mg/kg (most preferable 0.05-1.2mg/kg)

**Toxicity**

Oral LD50 860mg/kg in mice (about 70mg/kg for a 60 kg adult)

Blood pressure in dogs was not affected in a dose of 8mg/kg (4 mg/kg in humans)

Reduced motor activity in mice and rats by 50% in 160mg/kg (13 mg/kg and 26 mg/kg in human dosage)

Does not potentiate amphetamine nor have any stimulatory effects like amphetamine.

No side-effects has been reported.

Reproduction has also been studied

Cancer risk is unknown


**Testing**

If anyone get their hands on it (which should be very soon) I propose that it is tested a lot to prove or disprove the claims. 

The first test that should be used is dual-n-back

Another way would be to use http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/ (one of each type) and use the same schedule as used for dual-n-back. Digit span would most likely be the most interesting to prove or disprove the claims of an increase of around 200%. 

Another unique way to test it would be with IQ tests before and after. Do a maximum of one before (and not a random one on the internet) and then do another whilst being on PRL-8-53.

**EDIT:** mistermojorizin suggested ABAB testing instead

Blind testing would be awesome too

I purchased 100g of Aniracetam a few weeks ago from BYOB.  I'd had good experiences with Ani before and I knew what quality Ani looked like.  The stuff I received didn't exactly have the look or texture I expected.  It also dissolved readily in water which should not happen.  I bought replacement Aniracetam from Elevated Labs (which had exactly the properties I expected to see) and made a quick comparison album.

http://imgur.com/a/RM9uT

Its pretty clear there are some big differences between the two brands

Edit: From what I've gathered

Edit 2: I think its likely the substance packaged was actually Oxiracetam, dissolve at the same rate, and tastes almost exactly the same (mildly bitter / sweet).  Other people posing in the thread with ""Aniracetam"" from BYOB that looked similar to mine describe the same Oxiracetam-like properties, some from the same batch.  I think its extremely likely at this point there was no shady business on BYOB's end and it was a mis-labeled batch that got sent out.  I guess I should consider myself lucky, Oxi at Ani's price is a great deal.

Edit 3:  I thought I'd do a final edit.  Health Supplement Wholesalers quickly shipped out to me a new package of Aniracetam.  Just to clear any doubts of the actual quality of their Aniracetam I redid my previous tests.  I also added a visual comparison at the end of BYOB Oxiracetam and the ""Aniracetam"" I received before.

I think I have narrowed it down to SBIO (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth). All of my symptoms fit, raw maca powder can cause digestive issues if the starches are not gelatinized. Basically the powder needs to be cooked at around 300*F to break down the enzymes. I have been treating it with various methods, but it does not seem to be improving. Eating any dairy, fiber, sugars, etc makes the pain come back. If I fast, the pain stays at bay. If I eat spicy food, probiotics

So be careful if you are using raw maca. I would suggest baking it at 300*F for at least 30 min before ingesting it. You can also buy gelatinized maca for a little more. There's also a chance that there was bacteria on the maca when I got it. Who knows what goes on in the packing center in Peru. Cooking it should kill the bacteria as well.

FYI: I don't know if it matters or not but I'm a veteran with PTSD. 

The VA was providing me with Provigil but stopped about 2 years ago.

They were honest in telling me it was because of the prohibitively high price.

But they do write scripts for me which I can fill it on my on.

Filling my prescription at the local pharmacy has been incredibility expensive.

But I have hypersomnia and it was either pay the price or have no quality of life.

Finding this sub reddit and discovering mymodafinil.net was a great thing for me.

So far

I find their Modafinil is equivalent to Provigil; no difference; same

I am now on my 3rd day of using Armodafinil.


Armodafinil -

Cons:

Doesn't last as quite as long for me… maybe an hour or two less.

I am a bit anxious.

When it stops working for the day… boom

Slight headache. I'm not completely sure that it is caused by the Armodafinil


Pros:

I wake up feeling refreshed. That is something I never got from Modafinil.

Until I took Modafinil in the morning

Of course

Wakefulness


Modafinil -

Cons: 

For me: None


Pros:

Smoother.

When it stops working for the day

Although
That was about 6 months ago and so far
I had tried to stop taking them many times before with really bad results.

I will provide updates to this post (using the edit feature) for the next few days.


**Update 4th Day:**

Still a bit on edge/anxious.  But not too much. I can easily handle it. 

I have noticed
I've had this reaction with antidepressants (especially with Celexa *Citalopram*) before but never with Modafinil.

I'm moderately more talkative.

Drop off of effect is not as drastic as days 1 through 3.

No headache.

I am still waking up refreshed.  This is a HUGE plus

Energy level and motivation seems to be somewhat higher than with Modafinil.

Also

**Update 5th Day:**

Light nausea early in the day.

Still mildly anxious.

Drop off still rather sudden.

Still waking up refreshed.


**Update 6th Day:**

Tolerance break today.


**Update 7th Day:**

Irritable

Stomach in a knot.

Here is the msg between me and my buddy the pharmacist so far...

Hey _____ are you familiar with nootropics?
What would you make of a pill ingredient list like this? 

https://www.onnit.com/alphabrain-science/

Reply:

I wasn't familiar with nootropics
Nootropics are cognitive enhancers that are nontoxic. I've only gotten started at looking at the evidence for the efficacy of these ingredients, so you have to look at the evidence for each ingredient separately. 
The major problem with the ingredient list is that they are mistaking proposed mechanisms of action (how something might work) for evidence of efficacy (that a product does work). 
Normally, healthy person a drug or chemical that helps alzheimers or dementia isn't supported by research that shows efficacy in alzheimer or dementia patients. 
Aside from this, I'll try to go through the ingredients over the next couple days and give you an honest appraisal.


GPC Choline 100mg
I found evidence from the 1980s that increased choline intake did not affect age-related memory loss (1). In a cohort-analysis (an off-shoot of the Framinham Stroke Prevention Study)
Until there is a randomized controlled trial that compares a specific dosage of choline to placebo

Huperzine A 250mcg
The only study to show any effect on mental function in healthy people was done on middle-school chinese children. 34 matched pairs complaining of poor memory showed some memory improvement after 4 weeks of taking huperzine A 100mcg twice daily (3). All the trials done with this medication were short courses, diarrhea, dizziness, muscle cramping, high blood pressure, blurred vision, hyperactivity, and decreased heart rate.

Vinpocetine 5mg
There are two studies that were designed to test the effects of Vinpocetine on memory. Both were done by the same university department in 1985 and 1987. Both studies were only done in women, testing reaction times, showing a reduction in reaction time in recalling items in a memory set. The reduction appeared dose-related, with 40mg producing a larger reduction compared to 10 and 20mg. The reduction in memory recollection was ~180ms. There was no statistically significant difference with the 10 and 20mg doses (4). Therefore 5mg should have no measurable effect on any memory or cognitive performance.

As you all know in 1985 scientists at the University of California in Berkeley published anatomical studies of slivers of Einstein's brain after counting the different cells in the organ. They found the only difference between his brain and those of dead doctors was a greater ratio of glial cells to neurons.

""We know from animal studies that as you go from invertebrates to other animals and primates,"" said Professor Volterra, whose study appears in the journal Nature Neuroscience. This quotation begs the question, Does intelligence increase when the glial cell count increases or do the amount glial cells increase when intelligence is gained. This question is the basis for all physiological questions existing in the nootropics community, among others.

""These findings about Einstein's brain are intriguing, from the analysis of ""a single, aged, postmortem brain,"" but still, these findings provoked expanded thinking about the possibility that information processing, cognition

Continuing my research, i.e. neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. This study claims decenoic acid (HDEA) promoted generation of all three types of cells composing the CNS in a mature brain.

Furthermore

But, is responsable for the growth, not much else in Royal Jelly. So... where do we get royalactin or create a synthetic derivative?

I see the nootropic community is starting to focus on the incremental, where we need to be headed. Anyway, does anyone have any experience with Royal Jelly or increasing glial cells? What do you know about GDNF and how to increase it?

What you do is split the set in half on the first day and try just the following set.

vitamin0
vitamin1
vitamin2
vitamin3
vitamin4

You still have the headache.

so you split that in half again.

vitamin0
vitamin1
vitamin2

The headache goes away that day.  So you KNOW that it isn't in this set but you're closer to finding the problem.

Now try 

vitamin3
vitamin4

BINGO.  Got the headache again.

Now try just:

vitamin3

NAILED IT. The problem was vitamin3.

Now you can go back to your original set but just exclude vitamin3 to test your hypothesis.  

If you want to be VERY rigorous you could double blind yourself in these experiments.  

For long term side effects you can do the same thing but take each iteration and do it across a couple days.

So I'd been taking pharmaceuticals for probably around 3-4 years now

To give some context, agoraphobia, and depression while almost dying due to taking an obscene amount of stimulants on a 20 hr nonstop drive back from school. I was an idiotic, decaying, naive, piece of work, end of story. This was definitely the lowest I've ever been.

So I see a psychiatrist, and I felt like it was giving me a chemical lobotomy as I became pacified, mechanically content, dull, and rather lifeless. While I did this, I tried to go back to school but was unsuccessful and then began the process of picking up various low end minimum wage jobs for as long as I could hold them...

Then out of the blue, exercise, ways to deal with negative thoughts and energy) and things started changing slowly. I gradually felt well enough to slowly get off the drugs I was otherwise prescribed and by this point I had taken everything...prozac, cymbalta, wellbutrin, Concerta, Strattera for mental health issues and then I forgot to mention I was also having sometimes daily migraines so I tried everything for that as well: calcium channel blockers, imitrix, beta blockers

But about one week ago I finally completely freed myself of all of these and just started taking supplements and living healthily, I'm also more human and subject to the beautiful highs and lows that this brings. I recently also started a non gluten diet and am in the process of being tested for celiac so this could be a large confounding factor as well.

I've been back in school now for 6 months with a new degree, which I was lucky enough to be able to attain due to the outstanding support from my friends and family. If all goes well and the migraines and good vibes continue I feel very positive about the coming months / years! :D

    -Bacopa extract (300-600mg over 3x)
    -A pre-made stack I got at my local vitamin shop called Maxilife Choline Cocktail II by Twinlab (taken 2-3x a
    day) : 
      750mg choline
      425mg guarana
      12 mcg Huperzine A
      ~7mg CoenzymeQ10
      50 mg L- Carnitine
      50mg DMAE
      ~63mg Phosphatidylserine Complex
      and various other supplments (mainly vitamins at healthy levels) like 
      A,B6,Folic Acid, Pantothenic Acid, and an obscene amount of B12

""a community dedicated to improving cognitive health and function for peak performance."" I posted about it on /r/nootropics a few months ago

""I created this subreddit because I'm interested in investigating methods of improving the brains cognitive ability and overall health to reach peak performance (and maybe even beyond). 

The discovery of neuroplasticity has revolutionized our understanding of the brain. There are numerous devices and methods that claim they can improve your cognitive function. This subreddits purpose is to cut through the crap and find what devices and methods actually work. It's sort of like the idea behind the subreddit /r/nootropics

What do I mean by methods and devices?

**Examples of methods:**

-Juggling Increases Brain Grey Matter http://www.vth.biz/kb/index.php?article=186

-Can playing puzzles like sudoku and crosswords help to reduce the chance of getting Alzheimer?     http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/lifetime-sudoku-crosswords-help-fight-alzheimer-034754487.html

-Riding a bike 30 mins a day shown to reduce anxiety levels http://imgur.com/5PnD5

-Brain foods (diet) http://www.dirjournal.com/health-journal/top-10-brain-foods/

-Better habits (regular sleep schedule, etc). 

**Examples of devices:**

-pRoshi neurofeedback device http://www.strongu.com/Roshi.pdf 

-Nike strobe goggles shown to  increase short term visual memory (for at least 24 hours) http://mashable.com/2012/07/30/nike-strobe-light-glasses/

-Neurofeedback/biofeedback machines (there are hundreds of different ones)


The methods behind how this subreddit ""cuts through the crap"" is yet to be determined. I put some of my ideas of how to do it below. 

**Here are some general guidelines on how to do that:**

-Identify the claim being made then ask... Are the scientific methods used to validate the claim reliable? How was the experiments/tests constructed? 

-Who is making the claim? Are they trustworthy? Do they have an agenda? (look for the money). 

-Does the method the source explains how there device/method works make sense? 

-Baloney detection kit http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUB4j0n2UDU

-Be wary of pseudoscience.

-Be skeptical!

The current nootropics at my disposal are:
Noopept, Pramiracetam, and Piracetam. Nefiracetam and Aniracetam are in the mail being delivered right now. 


I started the morning with about 400mg of Oxiracetam, peas and corn were screaming at me. It was almost as if each individual vegetable was yelling, ""DO YOU TASTE ME? I'M HERE, AND I'M DELICIOUS!"". I asked my boyfriend to taste the green beans and ask him if they tasted any different - he sort of looked at me funny. ""Aren't these the best green beans you've ever tasted?"". They didn't taste particularly amazing, but they *tasted* in a way that I've never tasted before. 

I opened the door and a flood of sensations entered my perception. I felt the cold air - the light was brighter than I remembered it to be, or if  the drugs were really helping me take everything in in a way that I have never really experienced. 

There is heavy construction going on in my neck of the woods in Atlanta. I started thinking about the best way to get somewhere and in my mind I could very clearly see a picture of the roads from my apartment to my school and all of the different best routes - I was visualizing my Android phone's GPS and going through the different ways to get to where I was going. I ended up getting to school faster than I normally would by going a route that I've never really thought of before. 

In class, but I usually have to put in a lot more studying. When I studied the first time around, making connections with things was almost obvious. I was constantly thinking ""of course, that makes perfect sense, why wouldn't it?"". I used the quiz and the studying of the material as a sort of self-check on the nootropics ... and boy did it work. 

The first night after sleeping was amazing. I go to bed at around 11PM every night and wake up at 8AM. Waking up for me has sort of been like a slow boot-up process. I lay awake, waking up on nootropics was like having a Macbook Air (instant on). I woke up, my eyes were wide open - I was a little tired (reasonably, it was the morning) but I hopped up and my mind started racing on all of the things that had to get done. It wasn't an anxious ""oh I have so much to do"" but more a ""This is what I have to do, and this is the order I should do it in ... let's get started right now."" 

Needless to say that that morning started with another dose of nootropics. 

Last night my dreams were a little more bizarre. I remember becoming aware that I was dreaming - things were happening in my dreams which didn't make sense. I don't remember the exact details (if I wrote them down

I switched to mate about a month ago because I was horrified at all the sugar I was consuming in my coffee every morning. I'm one of those guys who gets up on a day off and drinks nothing but coffee until 11:00 AM or so when I have brunch. I was introduced to mate by a Paraguayan friend last summer, which works fine. The mate I have now is Guayaca brand, but I've tried several varieties.

The stuff is extremely easy to prepare: you put the bombilla in the mug, but I actually quite like it once I got used to it. Usually the drink is finished by the time it cools down, and then I top it up again with hot water and make a second infusion. This one is milder, but still quite nice. A third infusion is possible, but it's much weaker, but still okay if you just want a warm drink on a cold day.

Experience: Holy shit, and very positive and happy. I can write fluidly, read long texts, and pretty much do everything that strong coffee or tea help you do. Great for waking up in the morning. Considering the stuff also contains way more ""healthy"" chemicals than coffee or tea, I'm quite happy with it. One of the big, big advantages to mate over coffee or tea is that I can drink a bunch of it in the evening and still sleep well at night. This is fantastic, as it's usually in the evening that I want that extra pep to get something done, I sleep soundly immediately after.

The downsides: It's not quite as easy to port around as coffee in a travel mug, mate is more expensive than tea and more difficult to find in places that aren't specialty stores. Some of these boutique tea stores (David's Tea, Teavana, etc) charge an absolute arm and a leg for mate ($7 for 50g!), which is quite impractical. Maybe I can find a better vendor online.

I know there have been minor threads on this before

Some reasons I think it might be: 
1. It's a stimulant which, meaning that it may not detract from sleep quality as other stimulants do and 'tolerance' can be restored more quickly, and (1b) it doesn't induce dopamine-byproduct toxicity like amphetamines.  
2. My understanding is that nicotine also acts on the nicotinic/acetylcholine system
3. Subjectively

Some downsides of nicotine: 
1. Vasoconstriction and maybe reduced sexual performance. 
2. Headaches and irritability when coming off it. 
3. I've seen some studies that find a strong association between smoking and long-term Alzheimer's risk.

1 hour in  I feel super jittery.  I got some restless leg syndrome and was uncomfortable.  I went to the gym asap to change my physiological state if you will.  Let me tell you I was on absolute fire.

My brain never has worked this well.  I was super focused. 

*A quick background on me:  I am naturally very introverted, but my anxiety was crippling so life has been much easier, but a whole lot less fulfilling.*

Back to my day.  I usually pace back and forth in between sets when lifting.  I take dozens of trips to the water fountain; I have always been like this.  I have a weird thing where I can't sit still no matter what I am doing.  I can't go to the movies.  Any waiting in lines is very hard for me too.  But while at the gym I was a lot more calm and focused and could sit at a machine in between sets.  It felt awesome not feeling the need to move around.

I usually just wear my headphones and just try to focus on myself.  Almost in a  completely narcissistic way.  I am always constantly thinking about myself when at the gym and how people perceive me even though I am in good shape already.  I ignore everybody. This pramiracetam though man

**I was witty as fuck. I felt so sharp.  I made several people laugh when engaging them.  It was like that feeling you get when you are in that state at a party where you can do no wrong and have complete trust in your faculties and you are the fucking man- the life of the party.  There was hardly any background noise.  Thoughts were clearer.  A lot of times I was like

You can tell it wasn't placebo either

That feeling of being approachable is something I usually only feel when I am fucked up on alcohol or benzos.  This felt clean with no side effects.  I slept better than ever too.

Just awesome!

So some questions:

**1)**  I also got some choline and noopept.  When should I throw those in with the racetam?  Or should I take each on their own first to see how they effect me?

**2)** Is this as good as it gets?  I feel like my life is changing already and this can really enhance my social and work life.  Will tolerance take effect like most drugs and it is all down hill from here?

Say when I am out of this racetam would switching to a different racetam help switch undercut tolerance?

**3)** Any better way to take this?  It seriously tasted like alien piss and don't know if I can take it like that everyday.  Is just chasing with water the best and most potent way though?

BTW thanks everybody here who helped get me into this.  Without perusing this sub I doubt I would have ever invested in this or have taken it seriously.",,t5_2r81c,1368180205.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/1e26u3/success_story_had_my_first_experience_with/

* Brain fog all the time
* Frequent naps
* Hard to not be lazy

After

* No brain fog. Used to think I was just lazy or that everyone felt the same but they toughed it out.
* Instead of naps
* Able to work longer. I've already cut out TV and games from my life. I work almost every hour I'm awake and have been able to increase my earnings because of this.
* Speech has improved A LOT. I can see how piracetam is a good supplement for pick up artists because you can think of witty things faster. Less slur in speech.
* Reading has improved; Easier to absorb. 
* More willpower. It makes such a big difference. I used enjoy doing nothing but now I can't stop working... my room is always clean.

Placebo effects

* I enjoy music more and hear instruments that I never paid attention to before.
* Vision improved. I look at the same shampoo bottle everyday and I can't read it any better than I could before. But it does feel like my vision improved when I'm not doing these tests. 

Supplements

* Piracetam + Alpha GPC 2:1 (1600mg piracetam twice/day)
* Theanine (200mg twice/day)
* Preworkout supplements (before workouts)
* Creatine
* Melatonin (at night)

Things I learned

* Get enough sleep. There's no better nootropic than wakefulness. 
* Work outside of home. I always go on reddit/lie in bed while working at home. Sometimes I go to reddit then close it right away because I know I've seen everything already. At a coffee shop
* Don't workout too hard. I used to workout daily with heavy weights until my clothes are damp. Still working out daily but I reduce my workout by a few exercise and still gaining mass without the after-workout crash.
* Avoid starchy foods. I just eat veges and some meat/protein supplements. No more food coma!
* Be happy. Being happy makes you work faster

Modafinil

* I REALLY want to try Modafinil. I bought some from mymodafinil.com as recommended here but haven't received it after a month and a half. Their website now says that they don't ship to Canada and I haven't received any replies. Don't think I can get my money back and can't find another source that ships to Canada.

/u/SuckaWhat

Thanks for your message. The manufacturer (T&amp;W group) sent us Tan colored Phenylpiracetam. I can't say anything about Liftmode, and some darker specs that were more dark tan in color. We complained to the manufacturer, who suggested that we have it lab tested anyway because it was very pure. We didn't want to waste $2k on testing, so we pressed the issue. Our rep told us that the lab had him believe that the Phenyl could range between tan and white from batch to batch, which was really not something that we were happy believing. When he investigated further, he found that the lab was suffering from a bout of laziness, and were not finishing the purification process. He criticized their attitude and we received several apologies. They are currently purifying the product to a more satisfactory purity level. 

Note that purification is often the most time consuming element of a synthesis project, but with Phenylpiracetam this just isn't the case. 

Hope that helps!

I can confirm that my tan Phenylpiracetam from Liftmode is from T&amp;W.  I replied to Robert

/u/SuckaWhat

Sure

A COA for a recent batch of Phenylpiracetam from T&amp;W has been floating around on the net, and I think the QA issue may only be an isolated incident. However, incidents like these do push us in the direction of domestic manufacturing. For example, we had a batch of Nefiracetam arrive from a different manufacturer that was completely unacceptable (brown chunks, strong solvent smell), and so we have placed an order with a lab in the USA. 

_________________________
________________________

His response went on to mention a few things that are unrelated to the subject at hand.  I will post that information in a comment below for anyone that is interested.  

To me this suggests that, if even the T&amp;W representative agreed and the company took it back to purify it and apologized. And since it appears that Liftmode got their supply (according to my COA) from T&amp;W, it seems to me that they did not get a well purified product.  

Let me also say, it seems a safe guess that what I received is actually Phenylpiracetam, but at a much lower quality standard than the COA indicates.  This does not make me not trust Liftmode for further purchases, as, judging from what NSN went through and Liftmode's character outside of this incident, it seems likely that they were assured that the product was pure and began selling it.

Healthy, smoking. I take Creatine for fitness, and Yohimbine for the occasional appetite suppressant.

I'm mainly looking to get two things out of nootropics

You see where I said nothing *besides* caffeine? Yeah, and have no problem doing it. I try to cycle it off during downtimes (weekends) and othe vacations, but it still isn't enough.

**I fucking sleep half of my life away**. And it is annoying as fuck. I want to fix it. An example? Lets say I'm entirely cycled off of caffeine, with 7 or 8 hours, I get sleepy very soon, within 10-12 hours. I take caffeine to combat it, but as we all know, it doesn't work too well. It fucks with my sleep schedule, and I have to start taking more and more. Week or two down the line I'm taking 400 - 600 mg of caffeine to maintain 12 - 14 hours of wakefullness each day.

I've tracked my sleep habbits

I also noted motivation

So, work my way to 1/4(50mg) the next day, and 1/2(100mg) the next, assuming no complications. I plan to have myself cycled off of caffeine before it arrives, as to not interact with it.

Thoughts and advice? Thanks!

First what will greatly increase your thinking prowess are subtle changes that will make you better able to think around the clock overtime vs something like adderall where you are on a roller coaster. The come downs of these are not conducive to learning. If you don't believe modafinil has a come down then you probably haven't taken it for a long enough time. The best psychoactive drugs are the ones that have been around the longest due to a lower chance of negative sides. The duration they have been around can speak volumes about their efficacy.

1. DHA + Alpha GPC + Uridine - There is really good evidence regarding this stack working. There are so many ridiculous posts about modafinil and piracetam and very little on these 3. These should be the absolute bread and butter of any stack. The synergistic effect of these three is very conducive to forming new neurons and new memories. Obviously over time

2. caffeine + L-theanine - Again

3. Nicotine - Don't smoke. Nicotine gets a terrible reputation due to smoking. That doesn't preclude the compound from being  advantageous. Like caffeine

A word about piracetam and modafinil - 
1. Piracetam - There isn't a lot of data that this drug actually works in healthy people. It's touted as one of the best

2. Modafinil - While this drug works

3. A word about Marijuana - This drug truly was one of the first domesticated plants. The jury is still out about the long term effects of it. I am going to share something with you that I heard an attending say, you are really selling yourself short even if your innate ability is not effected. 

I would encourage you to think about what I've said here. What will make your IQ go up in the long term isn't going to be the same as what will give minimal gains the short term. Many of these drugs work by simply increasing motivation

How safe compounds are to take long term is something to take into account.  Stimulants like adderall may work


Cheers guys.

EDIT: 

Look guys, nor do I really care. If you don't want to believe me, good for you. Nicotine and Caffeine+L-theanine have plenty of studies. Half can be found in the FAQ. As for the Choline + Uridine + DHA combo look it up. I am not here to baby sit. ",,False,,t5_2r81c,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/11wkqy/this_reddit_really_needs_some_help_heres_some/

The effects on her the next day were incredibly apparent. Her discussion and reasoning in study groups was substantially improved and even nuanced at times to the point she was raising issues I hadn't considered. 

Even in discussing her personal life, in discussing a possible long-distance relationship which she's been debating, she raised concerns over the possibility of getting a less than ideal position in the city her boyfriend would be working at and the extent to which her career would be compromised in the event that the relationship didn't work out, along with the feasibility of maintaining such a relationship for a few years if she was in a different city. It was a level of sophisticated reasoning I had never seen in her before.

Next day she was off of it and basically her old self. Then she took a 200 mg tab the day after and showed her intelligent side again. She did say she felt far more focused and involved in her material and liked the appetite suppressing sides.

I had never really noticed that pronounced of an effect of modafinil on myself outside of sleep deprivation. No energy slumps throughout the day

I took five mg - measured on a good scale - after my morning run. I thought about taking it prior to exercise

I didn't mix the powder with anything - I took it sublingually, I thought I felt a mood lifting, a slight widening of perspective. It is difficult to know when these things are real and when they are created by expectation and desire. I found myself smiling, almost wanting to dance around the house. I know that sounds silly!

I then ate breakfast - a bowl of goat's milk yogurt mixed with chia seeds and walnuts. This is when I realized something was definitely happening. I didn't expect this at all -  the taste of the food! I could taste multiple layers, but have never once had the full body orgasmic-like explosion of delight that I experienced eating that yogurt. 

Next, with levels of depth I've never noticed. The normal bitterness seemed to spread into a thin layer, with new flavor and brightness poking through with each sip.

Take note that I am NOT a representative of New Star Nootropics and am NOT affiliated with them in any way aside from being a very satisfied customer.

First off

Keeping this in mind I will start my review.

**Price**

 I first noticed this site from [this] (http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/17oyrg/nootropic_price_comparison_site_noophound/) post after seeing that their noopept was one of the cheapest vendors in the U.S. (at between $2 and $4 depending on the amount you order) Other -racetam pricing seems pretty good as well, and 25g of Centrophenoxine for just under $40 with free shipping. They also have monthly deals and bundles for 5-10%+ cheaper than normal pricing. (Currently there is a deal for 10g of Noopept for $34.50! Edit: This is only for this weekend, most likely feb 8th-feb 11th)

**Shipping**

I ordered all of this on Monday

The packaging was discrete; came in a rather small brown box with Scotch tape covering the opening and the shipping label. On the shipping label it was shown to be shipped from ""New Star""
The Noopept came in a very small glass vial along with a 12-15mg scoop (the scoop is MUCH smaller than I was expecting

**Product**

All of their powders have a COA (most, however nothing is sent along with the package. This is not too much of a disappointment seeing as how you can view them on their website, but it is always nice to take a few minutes and look at all the tests that were done when you receive the order. I suppose, however, that it is more useful to know the quality of the item you are looking to purchase before you do so.

*Noopept* ($9.79/1g

The Noopept has a strong, though it is bearable. Its look at texture I can only attribute possibly to corn starch, very manageable. From my research, it smells, tastes, and looks as it should. The effects are noticeable as well, I started taking this Noopept for two days and had a physics exam on the second day for which I was rather unprepared. I ended up acing it. I noticed that my short term memory is *vastly* improved, the Noopept is high quality.

*Centrophenoxine* ($19.50/25g; again

This has a very clumpy texture and smells and tastes absolutely *horrid*. This is normal, but I did read that taking Centrophenoxine on an empty stomach could cause nausea (which is what I had done). Again, this item is of high quality.

*Piracetam* ($7.95/30g; again

I actually have yet to try this, almost akin to Phenibut in its bitterness. I believe these characteristics are to be attributed to good quality Piracetam.

**Overall: 10/10**

I had a very good experience with this vendor in every aspect. Even their customer service is fantastic as I had a few questions on which items they plan to add at the end of February (one of them is phenylpiracetam

I would definitely give this vendor a 10/10. I only would like to see a few items a bit cheaper, high-quality, and relatively inexpensive source of -racetams and Centro, I would advise you to give New Star a chance!

1. Dosages (proper dosages of everything)
2. Common synergistic effects (Caffeine + L-Theanine

4. Quick synopsis of the relative pros/cons of each element in a stack.

Anyway, the way I envision it, is people would add their chemicals and their dosages, and it would automatically check to see if dosages are in the proper ranges, if synergies are being taken advantage of, check for contraindications, and a quick pro/con for everything in the stack.

1327446813.0,ov5u7,Update: Modafinil (Modalert) Experience,Brukhar1,41,3,22,"Heyo again folks

So

I figured

My dosage is 200mg/day, anything more and it was risking mental fatigue or a headache later on.  When I initially started, I had weaned myself off caffeine completely (I used to take 200mg of caffeine in the morning and usually had a caffeinated drink during the day).  I have since added caffeine back to my regimen, and I use it on days when I want an extra pop.  Combining 200mg of modafinil with 200mg of caffeine, in my opinion, provides the stimulant effect that many people are looking for, and complain about the lack of, that's how I achieve it).

I monitor my blood pressure and heart rate, but nothing all that significant.

First, has resulted in significant weight loss.

In November, at my heaviest I weighed in at 229.5 lbs.  I'm 6'2"", so this was at the upper range of overweight on the BMI scale.  I had been lifting regularly but had stopped for most of November, and I had cut off my cardio regimen because it was cold out and I was lazy.

As of today, and my body fat % went from about 20% to 15%.  Both muscle bulk and tone have increased, I have added about 1/2 an inch to my biceps and can also see my obliques more definitively.  I still have body fat to lose on my chest and stomach though.  I've never been horribly out of shape, but this is probably the best shape overall I've been in for awhile.  I currently lift 4x a week and do cardio, 30 minutes, 170bpm heart rate or higher, 7x a week.

I attribute this to 2 things.  The first is the increased motivation to exercise and performance that either modafinil brings directly, or by placebo.  The second is that modafinil has an appetite suppressant effect.  While I can still eat an entire pizza if I so choose, I can feel mentally full by eating less.  However, the bigger part of the appetite suppressant effect is that I no longer snack, particularly at night.  I used to eat crackers, chips, or some other snack food at night.  With modafinil

Modafinil also helps with appetite in another, causes dry mouth.  As such, my water consumption has increased from maybe 1 bottle a day, to about 5 bottles a day.  I think this lends itself to a feeling of fullness as well.

The great thing about the weight loss that I've achieved with modafinil, but I lose strength gains and muscle bulk.  Thus far, while losing weight with modafinil, I have actually increased the resistance for my exercises.  However, this may be the result of modafinil providing a performance boost as opposed to helping me retain a higher % of muscle.  But with the muscle definition and bulk gains that I have, I am inclined to think modafinil's appetite suppressant effects are helping me maintain a better diet and thus retain more muscle while still dropping weight.

Next up, I don't think modafinil does much for this.  I notice that I can sort of, zone out, and complete tedious work more easily than before.  But, I think modafinil actually makes it harder for me to concentrate on challenging academic material (I am preparing to study artificial intelligence at graduate school, so the reading that I'm doing beforehand is pretty intense).

Memory, I am not benchmarking myself using dual-n-back or anything of the sort (yes, yes, gwern, you can kill me now :P ).  So, if modafinil is providing a memory boost, then it's certainly subtle.  I had a pretty high performing memory before taking modafinil anyways, and I've read that modafinil's nootropic effects (as if they can even be called nootropic in nature) are limited to lower performing individuals.

Okay, unquestionably.  If you're well rested, you probably don't notice it, but if you take 200mg and then try to sleep or take a nap, good luck.  If you mistime a dose, you can easily have problems falling asleep that night (ie, if you forget to take it when you wake up but take it 2-3 hours later, so if you are looking for 7-9 hours of sleep

It's somewhat strange, and somehow that works out in my favor so that I wake up at a better time for my personal rhythm.

I occasionally take 1-4 days off modafinil to reset my body

I have now gone through 3 phases of days off (2 days, unlike caffeine, where if I go from 200-300mg of caffeine to zero overnight, I have to fight the urge to drink something caffeinated the next day.

Now, in my opinion, exacerbate certain tendencies.  For example, I have always had nervous habits such as sewing machine leg, cracking knuckles, biting my lip, chewing my nails.  But on modafinil, and people have commented on the restlessness of my leg which apparently annoys them.  Also, modafinil does make me chattier and more argumentative (not in an angry way

I think that pretty much sums up the effects that I have experienced.  Any questions, and I hope my experience helps enlighten the nootropic community.",,False,,t5_2r81c,False,,

Final Verdict: Definitely not a scam, so take from my experience what you will.

We just want to let the community know that we recognize these are problems we have and that behind the scenes we are working to ensure we can have 24 hour turnaround on all orders in 2013 here.

HCT is a percentage of the concentration of red blood cells vs. plasma in the blood and a high level could be an indicator for Polycythemia. Turns out, or ESAs are many. Studies show that patients with breast or advanced cervical cancers who receive erythropoiesis-stimulating agents to treat anemia caused by chemotherapy died sooner or have more rapid tumor growth than similar patients who don’t receive the anemia drugs.

The only nootropic I have taken is aniracetam and I would say that the effect of the blueberries on energy and improved cognitive function is much more noticeable than that of aniracetam. Aniracetam made me kind of dreamy and lazy for 2-3 hours and then very irritable. That is not to say that there were not enjoyable properties of aniracetam as well (vivid colours come to mind)

Some interesting facts:

-Complete body antioxidant

-The antioxidant protection in the brain provides functional cognitive benefits including improved memory. A study carried out on older adults with an average age of 76 years improved cognitive scores on a repeat test after 12 weeks.

I'm curious if an antioxidant can really provide this much of a change. Is my brain really undergoing so much oxidative stress that a huge intake of antioxidants really 'unlocks' this portion that is normally unavailable? 

Also, since the sugar is absorbed at a slow rate into the bloodstream, providing even energy distribution.

There's also the possibility that I was simply not consuming enough fruits and vegetables in general

***TL;DR***

**Stack:**

* Piracetam
* Fish Oil
* ALCAR/ALA
* L-Theanine
* Caffeine 
* B12

**Effects:**

* Vivid Dreams
* Deeper Concentration
* Profound Mind-Body Connection
* Easing Conversation
* Thoughts flow
* Focused
* Creativity
* Angst/Anxiety

**Summary:**
There may be some truth in starting with an attack dose (at least with the Piracetam) as with me

***The Log***


***January 19th
-
* Piracetam – 4


I went to the gym after my second dose and I felt a greater connection to my body than usual. I had more control over my range and movement of exercise, not having thinking too much of what to say yet it made since and I kept going, I’m usually not like this. My mood was very uplifted, excited, and unafraid. Being a Saturday I have not been able to test it’s “book functions” very much but I am excited to channel that energy into academia instead of social interactions.

-

***January 20th
-
* Piracetam – 4

Today was cardio day at the gym. I was able to run for an hour, Piracetam definitely has a positive endurance/motivation effect while exercising, giving you a greater mind-body connection. Again mood was uplifted, not as elevated as yesterday, it could’ve been because either, unlike yesterday I wasn’t at a social event/function today or it was placebo.  Conversations came easier. Thoughts flowed, and felt more creative. 

-

***January 21st
-
* Piracetam – 4
* ALCAR/ALA – 800mg/400mg
* L-Theanine – 200mg 
* Caffeine – 100mg

On day three I didn’t feel as stimulated as I had the past two days. It could’ve been placebo or my body is getting adjusted to the dose (4





***January 22nd
-
* Piracetam – 4
* ALCAR/ALA – 1
* L-Theanine – 100mg 
* Caffeine – 100mg

Back to class and the daily grind of the usual. I decided to take slightly less Piracetam in the night because while it wasn’t keeping me awake at night it kept me rolling for a little while and kept my mind going. Bumped up the ALCAR, I was just more motivated to do it. Overall, I feel like this stack is going well I may modify it a bit tomorrow depending on my energy levels.

-

***January 23rd
-
* Piracetam – 4
* ALCAR/ALA – 1
* L-Theanine – 100mg
* Caffeine – 200mg


Exam was today, yet they are subtler; not as “jumpy,” if you will, as when I first started but the effects are there. It feels just right, 4,800mg of Piracetam may have been too much so taking it down to 4,000mg allows me to channel focus more towards what I’m doing instead of trying to divide that energy into a plethora of things. Going well

-

***January 24th
-
* Piracetam – 3
* ALCAR/ALA – 1
* L-Theanine – 100mg
* Caffeine – 200mg

Tried a lower dosage of Piracetam and again,400mg tomorrow to see how that works. No fatigue and complete mental acuity throughout the day.  

***January 25th
-
* Piracetam – 2
* ALCAR/ALA – 1200mg/600mg
* L-Theanine – 100mg
* Caffeine – 200mg

Last night I had some of the most vivid dreams I had experienced. Though I took my final dose of Piracetam &lt;1 hour before going to bed so that may have had something to do with it. I’ll probably end up doing that tonight to see what dreams come to me. Again, I’m really enjoying this stack and will continue it.

How cool would it be if there was a website where people could semantically input (with actual data and numbers, keep track of and find stacks, but the data could also be used to identify patterns and correlations between different drugs/nootropics. For example, we could clearly see the correlation between intake of recitams and headaches (assuming no intake of choline), and even confirm this by seeing how headaches disappear with choline intake (for a specific individual). People could use it as a log, by inputting everything they take and noting all the benefits or side-effects, and it could even suggest quantities and/or to add X element to your stack based on them (side-effects). 

Let's say I'm new to nootropics, my level of experience and the level of risk I want to take, where I live (which could filter illegal drugs, if I want), etc. The system could suggest me piracetam, and lead me to different resources about it (including data from the website, indicating the average results and side-effects, where I can purchase it (and under what trade names), it could suggest me alternatives that work for other people who also don't react to piracetam.

Such a complete system would be fairly complex to build, we could build the recommendation system and additional features on top of it.

I bought my stack from Nootropic Hub (UK based site

I take half a teaspoon of Piracetam in the morning (circa 7am) and again at lunch (around 12:30am) along with a little over half a teaspoon of Choline Bitartrate mixed in water. Two important things to note: If you do not take sufficient amounts of Choline you will get a throbbing, if you can I’d advise you take it with a soft drink like Dr.Pepper or Coke to disguise the taste.

What can I expect?

This is going to be purely qualitative. You will be focused

Another great effect which was unexpected and which I’ve also read on a few topics here is how noticeably more sociable you become. I attribute this to a surplus of energy which naturally lends itself to you engaging with people more.

My caffeine addiction is all but gone; I regularly had 5-6 cups a day at work now I rarely have one a week.

From his post:
&gt;It is a fact that amphetamine is a powerful stimulant, which give it mildly neuroprotective effects - it's preventing (or at the least lessening) the negative effects of overexcitation. It also boosts GABA production; GABA is inhibitory, essentially glutamate's opposite (though it functions much differently, this comparison works for a simple explanation).
The type of stress your cells are under is often referred to as ""oxidative stress"", also exhibit antioxidant effect. I would definitely supplement those two alongside amphetamines. As for the L-Theanine, there are likely better neuroprotectants than that that I can't think of at the moment. Anyone reading, feel free to share any examples of good protectants!

I always had problems motivating myself and focusing. I get easily distracted/bored. And I am a world-class day dreamer. I like to imagine scenarios in my head and live them. Those scenarios always involve me having some form of success.

The second part (distracted, I would imagine myself writing a 3d renderer from scratch, publishing it and imagining how people will love it. I guess it motivates me at first but it always end up a major waste of time. Most of the time, I’ll drop the project and switch to something else that will give me the same early excitement again.

I guess the fact that I started researching drugs highlights my tendency to go after the easy path rather than work hard.

Anyways, I just felt too wired and it gave me headaches. 50 – 100 mg felt a lot better.
At the end of the day, read books). And while doing a task, I still would get distracted.

Nubrain sent me an email eventually after they got the order in, so I did this. Their response was that even though someone told me my order had shipped, the order was not actually shipped, they were sorry, and they'd mail it that day.

About 4 days after they *actually* shipped my order I received the tiny hand wrapped package containing my Modapro.

Pic: http://i.imgur.com/ZJEmP.png

**My expectations:**  I expected this drug to give me results similar to Adderall where I felt a mental cloud lifted

**Actual Experience:**
On the first day I took a single 200mg tablet. After about an hour I started to feel the anxiousness I've associated with energy drinks

Literally all Modafinil did for me was erase grogginess while it was active.
I had read many different experience reports on sites like erowid.com and here which explained Modafinil effects similar to those of Adderall or Ritalin. It did not have any of these affects on me. My mental ""Fog"" was not removed like I've felt on Adderall and nothing became more interesting. I wasn't more creative or productive.

The next day I took a smaller does of half a tablet

On the third day I upped my dosage to 1 and 1/2 tablets (300mg). This was the first time I took it on an empty stomach, I didn't feel like I could run further or lift more like I may feel with some energy drinks or adrenalin, I just felt uncomfortably anxious.

Later during the evening of the third night, I am pretty confident taking the Modapro on an empty stomach gave me a severe ulcer. I was rolling in pain until about 6am. The only reason I didn't go to the emergency room was because here they're a very long wait and usually very expensive. I decided to try and wait out the ulcer and continue sipping milk. The pain eventually went away but I'm still being careful with what I eat/drink two days later. ***I would highly recommend NOT taking Modapro on an empty stomach*** to avoid the chance you'll have the same pain I had.

I skipped Modafinil the day after the pain and took it once again this morning, but otherwise has no positive effects.

**In conclusion**, but the experience was extremely disappointing. I would only recommend Modafinil as a way to stay awake for extended periods of time, like perhaps 12 hours after you're already tired, or to keep taking it every 12 hours to stay awake for two days straight. I don't expect to order any more of this as it did not make studying or any other activity more interesting or easier to do. I'll only use the remaining tablets for long drives most likely.

I've read previously Modafinil was the closest drug out there to the NZT pill from the new movie Limitless

Two weeks ago, so it should be more potent but produce the same effects. 

I took an armodafinil this morning and felt no real difference at first. My girlfriend and I walked a few miles around town, but even on equivalent/adjusted doses of modafinil, I never kept talking like I did on armodafinil. My mental reaction was nothing like modafinil, and I had way too much nervous energy at all times.

When I got home, dark purple that was close to black. Think of the shade of a really bad bruise, or the first stages of frostbite, or a ripe eggplant. This color spread quickly up my thighs, and remained there, slowly dissipating into lighter purples and blues over the next 12 hours. As of now, it's basically gone. 

Has anyone had a similar experience? My research shows that purple knees are a common side effect of amphetamines and mephedrone, I don't see why I should. Is it possible that my waklert was actually just amphetamines, or at least tainted by amphetamines? I'm going to buy a dancesafe kit for detecting amphetamines, but fair warning to anyone who has recently bought Waklert.

EDIT: 


Since some are concerned about toxicity:



&gt; **Published reports suggest toxicity may occur with 25(OH)D concentrations beyond 500 nmol/L (200 microg/L)**

&gt; Except in those with conditions causing hypersensitivity,000 IU)/d to attain. Published cases of vitamin D toxicity with hypercalcemia, for which the 25(OH)D concentration and vitamin D dose are known, all involve intake of &gt; or = 1000 microg (40,000 IU)/d.** Because vitamin D is potentially toxic, intake of &gt;25 microg (1,000 IU)/d has been avoided even though the weight of evidence shows that the currently accepted,000 IU)/d is too low by at least 5-fold.

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10232622)


&gt; **A clinical trial carried out during the autumn/winter season in 46 institutionalized elderly subjects (35 women, an increase in 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels above the 10 ng/ml threshold was observed and maintained for three months. A second dose, administered after 3 months, made it possible to sustain this level. No sign of toxicity was detected, notably no trace of hypercalcemia.**

[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1963239)


&gt; The serum level of 25(OH) vitamin D was clearly elevated at 150 ng/mL (reference range from 30 to 60 ng/mL)


[source](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22189812)



**200 ng/ml is equivalent to 500 nmol/L !!** As you can see from the above references you need to go somewhere beyond 200 nmol/L to approach toxicity and the cases of such are rare. On another note

Couples things to note. First, or meh-responders. I think I'm a responder. Even in the smallest doses, I ""feel"" each of these chemicals. And I think that's the problem.  Second, I'm an attorney, and my job requires me to be sharp and focused every day.  Third, I'm 30, male, although I often have trouble maintaining focus) and I exercise often. Fourth

Piracetam: I first took a ""scoop, I felt a slight stimulant-like buzz, and I noticed that I had some light sensitivity, which is hard to describe, but it’s almost like seeing spots/tunnel vision. I then started up some Call of Duty and proceeded to easily unlock a half-dozen achievements that I'd been struggling with for weeks. I felt like I was making better, faster subconscious decisions, and my reaction times were faster than before.  A good start.

When I tried it at work, I had a meeting with a client and found myself wondering if I was having trouble focusing my eyes (I have great vision usually) and whether I felt or sounded ""high."" The same things also happened when I tried to write, which made it difficult to do so.
 
I also noticed increased irritability. I'm not a patient person to begin with, I don’t like that feeling. 

I had these same experiences with and without Choline. My Choline source is 500mg capsules of Choline Bitartate (235 mg per tablet of Choline). 

Noopept:  Started with 3 smaller 10mg scoops (~30mg) orally.  I quickly felt that too, but then I experienced a scary bout of short term memory loss.

Basically, and then realized I had no idea what I was supposed to do on the first one. I knew some of what we talked about, as if the memory was there somewhere, I just couldn't recall what my role was.  Luckily I was able to get the details from him without betraying my ignorance too badly. This has never happened to me before, and, frankly, I can’t let it happen again.

Pramiracetam: My dosing with this leaves a lot to be desired.  The FAQ suggested 300mg twice a day as a starting point.  Because New Star gave me only two spoons, I had to improvise. Pramiracetam is crystally and less dense seeming that noopept, so I figured that a scoop would be less than 10-12mg each.  I still didn’t want to over do it, so I put 6 scoops from the small spoon, figuring that would be less than 75mg tops, and definitely less than 100mg.   I first used it in water, and then at other times dissolved into a mix of 2% milk and half and half.  

Even this small amount of pramiracetam hit me pretty hard.  I felt buzzed again, so I was pleased with those results. I just can’t seem to find a dose that won’t get me distractingly buzzed.  I’ve even tried with as few as 4 scoops (probably less than 50mg), and it hasn’t helped.

So

Tl;dr version:
Will ani or oxyracetam help with verbal fluidity without the minuses listed below?

My experiences so far:
Piracetam: +quicker reactions and decision making, high feeling
Noopept: +lesser, brain fog.
Pramiracetam: +verbal fluidity

Boxing and other sports which cause head trauma obviously cause mental decline. A football player who consumes piracetam is likely just wasting his money because quitting football might be more effective than consuming many

There are also several studies which indicate a decline in IQ related to fluoridated communities. To avoid the ""alarmist"" association many people get from advising the avoidance of fluoride (fluoridated toothpaste and tap water)

Other areas to consider: proximity to pollution, BPA exposure, alcohol/drug use, prescriptions you may not need and OTC medications such as benedryl may cause mental decline, bio-accumulation or bio-magnification of heavy metals and other toxicants in fish and farmed animals, (perhaps this is why vegans claim to ""feel better,"" since they are effectively detoxifying their bodies. It is extremely important to only eat organic meat if you do eat meat).
 

On to the supplements: I've tried many so-called nootropics
-Piracetam. Many different dosages from 1 gram up to 7 or 8. I've tried different dosages for different time spans, etc. I believe this to be as good as placebo. Also tried this with different forms of choline and cannot distinguish this combination from just choline.
-""Alpha Brain."" Many dosages, but was immediately turned off by the fact that they included GABA which doesn't work and cannot be active. The price is way too high for this product. 
-Mucuna pruriens. I noticed a general mental lift in problem solving and verbal communication. Also increased sex drive. The fact that this is used to treat the cognitively impaired elderly (L-Dopa) adds credit to this substance as one that performs better than placebo.
-Vinpocetine- very cheap and I believe it may be active
-Rhodiola- I tried several brands and different dosages. I noticed that I became tired less or not at all while working. Also a possible general mood lift
-Bacopa - Cannot distinguish from placebo.
-Fish oil - Cannot distinguish from placebo because my diet is high in flax seed
Ephedra sinica- undesirable based on side effects
Kratom- does show some ""cognitive enhancement
L-theanine- cannot distinguish from placebo

Their new batch is very white and fluffy

One possible concern here is the included analysis paperwork is from March 2013 and reports a &gt;99% purity as well as an off-white, as you can see, it is pure white and fluffy this time and not a pale yellow color. Another issue of contention is the date of analysis. Mark at LM has contended that this new batch just got produced earlier this month and then re-purified just last week. If that's the case, why is this analysis paperwork from March?

I have sent Mark a link to this post and hopefully we can get a response. If he doesn't post a response here then I will include what he says in email. I would imagine somehow the correct analytical paperwork somehow didn't get shipped out with this batch and the paperwork received was from their last batch because the information and time matches the phenylpiracetam product I received from LM 4-6 weeks ago.

I have taken a 135mg dose of this new batch this morning and will report back later with my thoughts and feelings. Please feel free to discuss further as I will be checking back throughout the day myself.

Abstract

There is an increasing interest in nootropic drugs for the treatment of CNS disorders. Since the last meta-analysis of the clinical efficacy of piracetam, mechanism of action, dosing, toxicology and adverse effects of marketed and investigational drugs. The major focus of the literature search was on articles demonstrating evidence-based clinical investigations during the past 10 years for the following therapeutic categories of CNS disorders: (i) cognition/memory; (ii) epilepsy and seizure; (iii) neurodegenerative diseases; (iv) stroke/ischaemia; and (v) stress and anxiety. In this article, piracetam-like compounds are divided into three subgroups based on their chemical structures, known efficacy and intended clinical uses. Subgroup 1 drugs include piracetam, oxiracetam, pramiracetam and phenylpiracetam, its overall effect on lowering depression and anxiety was higher than improving memory. As add-on therapy, which demonstrate antiepileptic activity

I got a script from my doctor for Wellbutrin (Bupropion HCL) SR 100mg to start out. After a month when the effects kicked in I felt less depressed, but that ended poorly for me with dependence, headaches, irritability, and simply not having a lasting effect.

I saw the movie Limitless and was instantly fascinated with the concept of a drug 'unlocking' your brain. I searched online and was brought to Dave Asprey's ""Bulletproof Executive"" blog where he openly mentions his use of smart drugs. After tons of reading and research I decided to give it a go. Placing my bet with MyModafinil as the most reliable source

My what a profound effect it has.

It wasn't a sudden clarity of everything I needed to do and how to do it like I was expecting. Modafinil DID however increase my mental clarity for thought and mood/creativity. I feel like I have the energy levels I need to be myself again. Coupled with my Wellbutrin pills, like the contrast dial in my occipital lobe was turned up a few notches. I am more personable, and actually enjoy hearing the stories of others, and learning from their knowledge. 

Is modafinil a miracle drug for everyone? No of course not. Did it work for me and improve my quality of life? Hell yes

After taking a 100mg dose sublingually, it took a pot of black tea to make it stimulating. The phenylpiracetam was stimulating on it's own. My mood is lifted just like the nefiracetam, but it feels smoother. I am able to concentrate on work if I want, while still enjoying the music in the background. It feels very similar to nefiracetam, but ""cleaner"" if that makes any sense. It doesn't taste all that good, but it's better than the nefiracetam. So far I would say it's as strong as the nefiracetam at the same dose, with slightly different effects. At the moment I like it better. We'll see how it goes long term.

I will mention one thing that I found, and it did. I have now taken a couple days off nefiracetam and the pain has subsided. I am planning on taking it again next Monday to see if the symptoms come back. Until then I think it's too early to blame it directly on the nefiracetam.

**SHould I take Piracetam everyday until I get better?**

Article: [Piracetam for ME/CFS - CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME](http://livingwithchronicfatiguesyndrome.wordpress.com/2011/04/04/piracetam-for-mecfs/)

I do realize there is no ""[official]cure"" for Infectious Mononucleosis but can we at least discuss **WHy piracetam is aleviating nearly 100% of my Chronic Fatigue??!** I know Piracetam's Mechanism-of- action is not all ironed out yet

Any help would be much appreciated as most of people that have severe cases of Mononucleosis (like me) typically experience 6+ months of CHronic fatigue and that is massively depressing for me to hear. 


Backround: *I'm am a 19 Year old college student and bodybuilder and previously very healthy (take all my vitamins ect.)

* Had my first symptom Oct. 18th 2012
* diagnosed with Mononucleosis via blood-test Oct. 23rd 2012
* Hospitalized twice for a total of 4 days (for minor paralysis)
* received IV Cortisone shot and IV Nov 28th 
* doctors could find absolutely nothing wrong with blood test except for elevated liver enzymes (which means close to nothing while a patient is sick) sent me home both times
* Started to feel less-sick about 3 days after cortisone shot (what the hell is the half life of cortisone(1cc)? can't find that info anywhere) 
* however the massive/debilitating fatigue continues off and on now... it is day 49 and I want to be better before next semester starts! 

Some of my current thoughts: 

*since the cortisone shot made me feel better: Maybe fatigue associated with mono is a result of swelling to a degree that induces [cerebral hypoxia](https://www.google.com/search?q=cerbral+hypoxia&amp;rlz=1C1CHFX_enUS436US436&amp;oq=cerbral+hypoxia&amp;aqs=chrome.0.57&amp;sugexp=chrome

*And one of Piracetam's known effects is alleviating cerebral hypoxia...*

*So the swelling may have been from the [suboccipital glands?](http://drbentownsend.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/lymph-nodes-in-head.gif) as I have been experiencing accute pain and pressure in the back of my neck for the few weeks leading up to my hospitalization and still have the pain/pressure currently*

activity enhancer.",10,15,http://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/xppzv/bpap_an_catecholaminergic_and_serotonergic/,"I recently found out about the pharmacological mechanism of catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancers and found the only (!) substance that has both of these actions. The only previously known CAE was L-Deprenyl, but it also has MAO-B, and to a lesser extent MAO-A


They work by a rather ingenious mechanism
&gt;BPAP (along with another similar compound PPAP) is classified as a catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer. This means that it stimulates the impulse propagation mediated transmitter release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, which release a flood of these neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled manner, BPAP instead only increases the amount of neurotransmitter that gets released when a neuron is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a neighbouring neuron. So while both amphetamines and BPAP increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get released, amphetamines cause neurons to dump neurotransmitter stores into the synapse regardless of external input, while with BPAP the pattern of neurotransmitter release is not changed, but when the neuron would normally release neurotransmitter, a larger amount than normal is released.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benzofuranylpropylaminopentane

So basically

BPAP also very strongly (I've never seen numbers like this) upregulates and increases neurotrophins like NGF

**The novel catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancer R-(-)-1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane up-regulates neurotrophic factor synthesis in mouse astrocytes.**
&gt;We investigated the effects of the novel catecholaminergic and serotoninergic activity enhancer R-(-)-1-(benzofuran-2-yl)-2-propylaminopentane ((-)-BPAP) on the synthesis and secretion of neurotrophins, and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), in cultured mouse astrocytes. The protein and mRNA levels of the neurotrophic factors were measured using the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction methods, respectively. The amounts of NGF, BDNF, and GDNF secreted from astrocytes into the culture medium increased by up to 120, two, respectively, and GDNF. These results suggest that (-)-BPAP up-regulated neurotrophic factor synthesis in cultured astrocytes.

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12147307


There are a few threads about it on Longecity

I'm very exited about this and I'd love to have more people researching this rather novel mechanism aswell as the only currently known molecule which uses it.

I went to bed at 12:30am

So I sat at my desk and immediately noticed that my memory was fantastic. I could recall everything I had learnt from the day very very well. (I normally have to relearn things tonnes of times before they make it into my long term memory

I was able to create images in my head much easier and more clearly. I could rewrite some derivations/proofs clearly on paper and recall where in the lecture notes they were.

It can become a pseudo-memory-palace-technique)

But when I noticed a black/white flickering in the bottom of the view of my right eye. It was a tad bit worrying

I then noticed a very subtle HPPD-like symptom: words on a piece of pair seemed to flow around a little

While laying in bed, Fred.""* (replace Fred with my real name). I first thought ""who the hell is awake now?"" then realised I heard an imaginary voice. I was a little worried, but thought I would deal with whatever problems I had in the morning, and there was no sense worrying about it now. I was a little on edge the next day (partly as I slept poorly), and heard another voice saying ""yooohooooo, over here!"" at 1pm, while in a quiet public setting.

I hadn't taken any nootropics for about 3 weeks before the incident

Oxiracetam lessens the strength of a filter between your subconscious and conscious; which is how it both improved my memory and made me actually hear a thought I did not even consciously think. It might be harmless but I wont be taking it again; there isn't long term research into its safety

I have no history of mental illness in my family (except a grandma who has hallucinations because of her blindness: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Bonnet_syndrome )

I used to always fall asleep in the classes that I had directly after lunch or breakfast.

Fastforward to December 2012, resulting in low levels of serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine. I got prescribed 15mg of Deplin a day, which is straight methylfolate (plain folic acid/folate won't cross the blood brain barrier).

Since then, I'm considering giving tyrosine another try. Ritalin helps in a lot of ways, but I'm seriously lacking in motivation. 

My question is, is because of the poor levels of methylfolate I had in my body? Do you think that since I'm on the Deplin now, and have the menthylfolate my body needs, would I see that nice boost of motivation I got the first day? Also, any idea of how the tyrosine would interact with my Ritalin?

1364508954.0,1b7dng,My take on Sunifiram after 3 doses,JumpBradJump,27,3,3,"Not that three doses is really that substantial

I received my shipment from New Star yesterday evening and measured out a single dose using a 12-15mg scoop and splitting into three equal sections (I know it isn't accurate, but instead has a slight tingly/burning sensation on the underside of your tongue. I relate the feeling to using too many spritzes from cinnamon flavored breath spray, without the cinnamon flavor.

As far as effects, with a bit more of a rushing onset. Whereas noopept provides a gradual increase, I feel like sunifiram have a very quick onset for full effect. I was switching attention between an episode of Archer, and a conversation with my fiancé, and I felt like I was able to totally change my direction of thinking and experience whichever I was focusing on with full focus. There was a slight euphoria along with all of this as well. One of my first thoughts after the effects had kicked in was that sunifiram had accessed some hidden switch in my brain, flipped it on, and given my brain an extra jolt for mental processes.


The drawbacks? I have noticed that the time these effects last is seemingly very short. This could be due to the initial rush of effects taking place, it really wears off fast). I really only notice sunifiram is taking effect for the better part of 2 hours, and then by the 3rd or 4th hour, the effects are gone. Possibly there will be a buildup with this?

I took another dose this morning before class (college senior) and felt the similar effects taking place. I had also upped the dosage by a slight amount (maybe closer to half of the 15mg scoop) and had a slightly better experience, the effects had mostly worn off again. 

Took a third dose along with 15mg noopept, added it to my normal stack) and can definitely tell a difference with sunifiram added to the stack. Everything is a little clearer than my routine Noopept, nefi, and piracetam. This dose has been over 45 minutes ago, so the effects are still warming up, but I believe I will continually add suni to my stack.

Also it caused a mild case of nausea and occasional drowsiness which ultimately forced me to sleep the second day of use approximately 4 hours, fortunately enough I didn't have much to do that day. 

However much non pleasing the side effects were, and to counter any state of drowsiness I instantly had a caffeine pill (200mg) ready for that, which much to my surprise, did synergize greatly with Hydergine. Frankly, afterwards, I never felt that energetic in months. It was as if I had a massive adrenaline rush that drastically improved my mood and provided me with an utmost drive of motivation a body seeks for. I was ready to start doing anything. ANYTHING. I never felt that prepared - mentally and physically - in years. Plus I didn't encounter the side effects which I had the first two days during my trial; perhaps the only downside  I could think of (isn't bad actually) was the excessive amount of drive that had me wanting to go out and start a random fight with random strangers - a friendly fight, that is.

I never budgeted before, I did workout a bit. My house was a mess -- papers everywhere. I was totally disorganized. I spent my weekends doing nothing at all. Smoking weed and playing video games. But when I got on prednisone, I organized everything. I spent hours with total focus, organizing my entire budget. I started maxing out my 401k, I made a ridiculously detailed and elaborate spreadsheet to track my finances and for the first time in my life made a budget for myself and made an effort to stick to it. I made 1, 2, and 5 year goals for myself. I bought a filing cabinet and top down piled up every single piece of paper in my house and grouped everything into piles on the group. It was like that scene in Vanilla Sky where he's preparing to go back to work and has piles of papers all over the place as he studies stuff. Once I sorted everything out, investing

Once I got off the prednisone I maintained some form of all this organization. The filing cabinet was probably one of the best moves I've ever made, a much smaller dose, and life got a little better again. This time I started caring more about my work, and taking the effort to learn new programming languages and tools and API's, and work on open source projects that I had been wanting to do forever. 

In the years after the 1st prednisone experience I was shocked at how productive I was. I was like, and then vyvanse. These medications were not the same. They made me hyperfocus on shit that didn't matter, and didn't give me motivation to get my life in order or to accomplish long term goals. It was like tunnel visiion. I would waste entire days, and weeks reading stuff on the internet that I was interested in, watching porn. It was like, whatever I was interested in, that interest was magnified 1000x, when I need to do work that is mundane.

**Day 1: 4/9/2013 nighttime**

6 months have passed since I began taking Adderall. It has helped me tremendously with being able to deal with my stress load as well as with motivation and writing laboratory reports. However, only simply allowed me to work on things for longer.  The more research I did on it, the more I realized how bad it was for me. I found out today that research on its neurotoxicity indicated that dopaminergic neurotoxicity was present in squirrel monkeys [found here] (http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/315/1/91.long). Secondly, this has also been shown to be present in mice albeit in different dosages here which I have known since beginning the drug, but my psychiatrist dismissed my fears saying that I shouldn’t worry about it [mice](http://www.quora.com/What-are-the-long-term-effects-of-Adderall-Dexedrine-or-Ritalin-use#). Ritalin has been found to be neuroprotective and it seems like a good idea to make the switch (to me at least), but this would be at least 3 more months down the road because I still have 3 months of Adderall left and I don’t want to risk any more damage to my brain or my heart (since both could possibly be [cardiotoxic](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2518387/). Also, even though there has not been enough research on the topic

I plan to quit by substituting caffeine in at the times that I normally take Adderall and possibly 3x a day if needed. Then I will return to my normal cycling of caffeine to using it 4 x a week; once a day on the weekends and twice a day on days that I don’t have to work in the laboratory. Here goes nothing.

**Day 2: 4/10/2013 12:09 pm**

Took 30 mg XR x 1 7:30 am this morning. I will not be taking my second dose at night which is 10 mg IR. 

I mainly took XR today because I have a test and didn’t want to be negatively affected by quitting right before my test began. 

**Day 3: 4/11/2013 7:00 pm**

I feel like shit right now. I felt on top of the world for 30 minutes this morning but then I became extremely sad, probably because of caffeine even though I didn’t feel like it helped that much; I need to sleep now, everything is just too much for me. 

**4/11/2013 11:00 pm**

Woke up from my nap and feel slightly better. I still don’t feel like 100% right now though.

I am going to brush

**Day 4: 4/12/2013**

Today is so much better. I am at 90% and I am happy to say that the worst part of my withdrawal is over. The caffeine is making a bigger difference today. 

**Day 5: 4/13/2013**

I feel normal again. I am so glad that this is over. It is time for a nice

The guy I contacted told me he'd get me a sample out to me by Tuesday (it was Saturday). By Thursday

Thinking this was a stand up move

My first dose was at the beginning of a full work day, really. Everybody else was drinking energy drinks, I abstained for once. As the label says, you can take another one in 4 hours, so I do. Again a slight clean energy/ focus, maybe a slight edginess.

We're working a big landscaping job, impatient, place the wrong garden bed in the wrong place, etc.

I get home and I'm still a bit out of sorts. Don't take 3 in one day I tell myself.

Next Day: I take one, Sulbutiamine, and PS have never had that reaction in me, must be the ratio.

Day 3: Same thing, everybody, inanimate objects, what the fuck....

Day 4: I take 25 mg DMAA (methylhexanamine), anxiety-free, short acting stimulant. At this point I'm not even planning on taking Nootam now that I took DMAA, but something in me said ""what the hell,"" and I took a Nootam against my earlier intentions.

*Completely* different experience this time. All of a sudden the problems I had had with Nootam weren't there anymore. It was like the 25mg DMAA was skyrocketed beyond its usual focus and motivational qualities with more pronounced nootropic effects. I feel great!

Day 5-15 I don't miss a day without my Nootam pill and my DMAA pill, confident, and just overall good well-being.

I have a *theory* for why it started out terrible and then great:

Noopept, Sulbutiamine in the frontal lobes, and to a lessor degree, caffeine. Furthermore, CDP-Choline (whatever dosage it actually is in this formula) regulates glutamate overabundance in the brain by glutamate uptake and simultaneously increases the availability of dopamine and noradrenaline, thereby potentiating the dopaminergic action of DMAA and caffeine as well while keeping glutamate over-stimulation in check. 

The cholinergic components of both CDP-choline and sulbutiamine are surprisingly a small factor here in contrast to the glutaminergic/dopaminergic responses

Another quirk worth noting here is the accumulation effect Noopept has and its notoriety for BDNF release. Couple that with how supplementation with CDP-choline can increase the amount of choline available for acetylcholine synthesis and aid in rebuilding membrane phospholipid stores after depletion

So we have a low affinity choline uptake environment created here that delegates the phospholipid structures (phospatidylcholine, coupled with Noopepts' BDNF release. Quite a desirable environment if my theory is accurate. 

This was definitely an interesting experience for me for sure.
I plan to keep taking 1 Nootam, thank you for your time and I hope you got something out of my experience.

**TLDR:: I asked for Nootam sample, Nootam made me impatient and edgy  until on day 4 I took DMAA with it which completely turned things around and led me to investigate the mechanisms of why that all happened.**

   Intelligence is the material of human achievement. Every distinction between humans and mere animals is the result of our overlarge supercharged brains. We are animals who have been granted by the circumstances of our evolution power to order our world to an extent and scope never before seen on this planet. We are the rulers of the ecological community. However

  
   For the past 50, discovery of DNA, etc.--are the work of the collective intelligence of the species. The “hive-mind” is talented in some areas but weak in others, such as long-term planning (our inability to solve global warming) and morality (the continued existence of genocide and war). A society of minds informed only by evolutionary signals can never transcend the animal kingdom from which we arose. 

  
   To fulfill our potential and become completely human it is necessary to further develop our individual minds. The field of cognitive enhancement exists to do just that. 


   Imagine the consequences of, or even simply among those involved in government. Such a shift would change the course of history in radical ways. What may strike you as science fiction is not far off in scientific terms--the fields of neurology and psychopharmacology are moving quickly and our understanding of the biological infrastructure of intelligence grows accordingly. You know how it is said that people use on average only about 10% of their brains? Through advancements in medical science, it will soon be possible to use a vastly greater percentage and eventually even exceed the brain’s biological limitations. 


   The safe and effective “smart drugs” that are our best bet for sustainable cognitive enhancement are just around the corner. In fact


   There exist a few options for those looking for a mental boost, Adderall and its relatives are more productivity enhancers than intelligence enhancers, and their beneficial effects come with the risks of neurotoxicity, heart problems, and addiction. 


   More promising is the large and diverse class of chemical known as nootropics. The term “nootropic” refers to any substance that improves mental function and is neuroprotective or at the very least entirely nontoxic. To qualify as a nootropic a compound must be effectively free from negative side effects. The original nootropic is Piracetam


   Another nootropic is modafinil, clinical testing, and use--the more we learn about the biological basis of intelligence, the better able we are to deliver focused and safe therapies to enhance it.


   Intelligence is not one monolithic trait. Instead it is a loosely connected set of mental functions including memory, planning, cognition, problem solving, and the capacity for abstract thought. The complexity of these interwoven systems slows progress in the study of cognitive enhancement. It may be possible that our minds cannot operate on a level too much higher than they do now--the hardware may simply not support continual intelligence gains. It is clear, however, that some enhancement beyond our current level is possible, and effective.

I hope you guys agree.  *Skip to the tl;dr if you dont want to read a wall of informational text :/*  
******  
I've been lurking on r/noot for quite some time and have been fascinated by nootropics.  I understand that everybody reacts differently to racetams, however I have not seen many describing the differences between some of the most popular ones.  I was simply hoping to begin a thread where some of the more 'experienced' racetam users can describe their experiences with different racetams and perhaps even combinations (an even less covered topic on this subbreddit, perhaps more appropriate for r/stackadvice?).  And by 'more experience', I simply mean those of you who have had the opportunity and time to experiment with various racetams (primarily piracetam, oxiracetam, pramiracetam, aniracetam


Here is my experience and understanding of nootropics thus far (and I will attempt to make it brief):

**DISCLAIMER:**
First off, but I assure you that I have tested my risk for serotonin syndrome in a gradual way by slowly increasing the numbers and dosages of serotonergic drugs I am taking, and for some reason, simply do not ever have symptoms even CLOSE to what would indicate serotonin syndrome.  However, it is a serious risk and anybody on an SSRI or MAOI should be aware and cautious of this potentially *deadly* syndrome.  


**My stack currently consists of:**

* L-Theanine + caffeine

* SAM-e

* 5-HTP

* Huperzine A

* CDP-Choline

* Green Tea Extract

* Fish Oil

* Creatine

* Bacopa monnieri  


**My reasoning:**  
  

**L-Theanine + caffeine**  
L-Theanine is a component found in green tea.  It is sold as a supplement to aid in relaxation.  It can readily cross the blood brain barrier and reach the brain.  When taken in combination with caffeine, it produces the 'best of both worlds' and appears to work in a synergistic way.  Both L-theanine and caffeine appear to be very safe.  A 2:1 ratio of L-theanine to caffeine will switch your brain into 'god-mode' when trying to study for an exam or do work.  Additionally, make sure your L-theanine is from Suntheanine as this is the only reliable source that contains a good source of active L-theanine.  Other supplements have been shown to contain mostly the inactive evil twin of L-theanine (D-theanine).  
  

**CDP-Choline**  
CDP-Choline is a better source of Choline than lechin (2.5% - 9.5% choline - usually derived from egg or soy), much more concentrated!).  There difference between other choline sources and CDP-Choline or Alpha-GPC is that CDP Choline can readily pass the blood brain barrier (bbb), which is where choline is converted to acetylcholine and produces its neurotropic effects.  Many people take choline suppliments without anything else, which most likely is a waste unless you are choline deficient.  Most choline is broken down in the bloodstream and has virtually zero nootropic effects.  It must pass the bbb to have any desired effects.  This is why I chose CDP-Choline.  And by supplementing with green tea extract, this prolongs the time it takes for the choline to be metabolized, thus providing more time for it to pass the bbb and have its nootropic effects.  Furthermore, Huperzine A is a  acetylcholinesterase inhibitor
  

**SAM-e
Furthermore, I take 5-HTP which is a precursor to serotonin.  Similarly to the effects Green Tea Extract has on choline, Green Tea Extract prolongs the conversion of 5-HTP to serotonin to serotonin thus giving the 5-HTP more time to pass the blood brain barrier.  Again, Serotonin Syndrome is a possibility.  Though serotonin is commonly targeted by antidepressants for its properties of increasing a sense well-being and happiness, it has also shown to positively impact memory and learning.  
  

**Creatine and Fish Oil**  
Creatine and fish oil are just good for you.  Plain and simple.  Of course
  

**Bacopa monnieri**  
Bacopa monnieri has been used in India throughout much of its history and according to research have a positive impact on anxiety
  
  
**My thoughts so far:** 
Meh.  There may be a difference, what can you expect from taking these supplements.  L-theanine with caffeine has been the most beneficial to me, but I never had an issue with caffeine jitters and cant confirm that it reduces this negative side-effect of caffeine.  When the racetams that I have ordered arrive (piracetam, pramiracetam, oxiracetam, noopept) arrive, I am most likely going to cut out everything but my choline-CDP, and bacopa monnieri supplements and see how that goes so that I can avoid the 'kitchen sink' of supplements that I am currently on.  That isn't to say that I have noticed any negative effects while on this many supplements.  I would just like to experience racetams on their own to be able to accurately quantify their effects.  
  

Jesus this was long... my bad.

**EXPERIENCES!!**
Just got my order of noopept, but [Newstarnootropics](http://www.newstarnootropics.com/index.php) beat [Nootropicsdepot](http://nootropicsdepot.com/) with the shipping (only by one day, both were fantastic suppliers and had very good customer service, I have talked with representatives from both sites and can pledge that they are very helpful, speedy in replying, and know a lot about their own products) Shoutout to user [ParMatrix](http://www.reddit.com/user/ParMatrix) for helping me out with the products they sell at nootropicsdepot and for giving me first hand suggestions on what to try next!  
  
Now for the review:  

**Dose: 40mg Noopept sub-lingual** (I thought the scoop that newstar supplied me with was 5mg scoops

I only took noopept for my first dose of racetams.  Would have liked to start with piracetam, and caffeine.  My results?  Awesome!  I did not experience the vivid 'increased-perception' colors that some people on this thread have expressed seeing, however I *did* definitely feel somewhat of an absorption of everything that was around me.  I noticed the effects of the noopept nearly 20 minutes after dosing. Its almost as if I was processing everything that was happening around me, no matter how insignificant.  I had minor headaches start almost instantly, but CDP-choline (250mg) instantly relieved these symptoms.  I felt happy, relaxed, and extremely focused.  I do find myself getting absorbed in tasks... this is extremely beneficial for studying.  However, the effects have been fairly mild (as I expected) but definitely there.  Its not like other drugs where you get a 'high' or a completely altered state of reality.  The best way I can describe it is simply an enhanced state of thinking.  Processing information faster, can't wait to see where the next few days will take me!  I will be sure to update further on my experiences on this thread!",t5_2r81c

I had no strong inclination towards choosing one over the other, being the ""purer"" and newer form of the drug.

Prior expectations: Relatively high. I've been interested in Modafinil for a long time. Stories of people turning into machines and productivity skyrocketing


Noticeable effects:

* Ate almost nothing all day. Had no appetite.

* Did notice jaw clenching and some other sort of ticks

* Time seemed to go faster than I've ever experienced. Would look at the clock and then turn around and look back and an hour went by. If was different. I will not place a value on it

* Did not notice any increased mental acuity

What I accomplished: After about an hour I was browsing the internet like a fiend, only getting up to go to the bathroom a couple of times. I went to town on the paper. I was into it, but a little too much, I would say. Basically editing and editing and editing, most likely way passed being helpful. And that's all I did. Would have like to have felt like there was a little more higher level processes going on, but it just felt somewhat low level. So I guess robotic does seem to be accurate here. I wanted to do other things but found it difficult to pull myself away as well. A little OCD-like. And then it was 4am.


Conclusions: Felt ""wakefulness"" in the simplest sense of the word. That's actually the best I can describe it, but it lasted much longer then I had planned. Probably the difference between the two drugs.

The problem is that statistically significant only gives you the ability to discern the cause/effect relationship. It does literally zero for how big the actual effect is.

What we really need to do is combine the two to make sense of it.

**SURVEY LINK FOR THOSE IMPATIENT** http://bit.ly/oO3JtH

Hey there Reddit.

My name is Colin Popell. 

I’d like to share with you the first public statement about my new company

A lot of the supplement market lacks a scientific bearing

So I decided to do my part to change it. Noo-Mix LLC will be a science based, and to the benefit of, the communities it interacts with. We won’t sell you any supplements we can’t find data that supports, we’ll conduct tests and gather data as much as possible, and we’ll pull products we find to either have adverse effects or no effect.

**How are we going to do this?** I am trying to build the most comprehensive data set of the effect of various stacks, backgrounds, and any other variables that might affect interactions with nootropics.

We’re also pretty sure we’re going to offer a few features no other company yet offers

**Where do we want to go with this?** Well, and gather the largest database of nootropic interactions in the world.

I’m a transhumanist too, but you can bet that money will be going into interesting projects in both drug and technological research.

**How can you help us?** Pretty easy, but please fill it out. The more people who fill it out, the better data we’ll get, and the better we can optimize our initial expenses. Plus it gives us market data so that we can get more money from investors to expand faster, and to serve our customers better.

Sorry, new supplement company wants to set a scientific and business standard, wants your business, wants to support the community, and wants data on your nootropic habits.

Worked great for getting shit done

**Ritalin:**

18mg Concerta (XR); Like the Dexedrine but less tweaky, so meh.

**Modafinil:**

200mg provigil a day - OMG FTW!
Seriously this stuff is great for me.

Can't sleep and it's now 3am? 100mg and gaming till it's time for uni

Home late and it's now 3am? 100mg and sleep for 3 hours waking nice and alert

Need to get stuff done

I really can't say enough about how modafinil makes my life functional

Advice:
Don't try to go longer than 48 hours

Getting less than 6 hours a night still builds up a sleep debt.


**Take-away:**

To grind work or improve mental performance i'd choose dexedrine.  To deal with tiredness(whatever the cause) I'd choose provigil.  If I didn't want stims I'd screw about with piracetam and choline again.(If only for the psychological effect the ritual aspects involving OJ and bitter-as-hell powder has for me.)

**Also:**

1. I have a diagnosis of mild asperger's disorder

2. Mixing caffine with any of the above stims raises my blood pressure and heartbeat uncomforably. 

3. Modafinil gives me a funky finding on liver function tests

I don't have problems going to sleep

I started using modafinil a few weeks ago. I wasn't as tired then, which is really why I was trialing it - I started taking it more regularly.

I would say that for about a week, at varying doses. At least 100mg per day though, generally 200.

So this is what I'm trying to figure out: From what I understand, if you're getting tired, it could be due to you building up a sleep deficit and not noticing it. That's what I think is right - but I've been getting way over 8 hours every night, and it seems that the longer and more regularly I take modafinil (and this is only for a little over a week), the less benefits I see, and the more groggy I end up feeling. This can't be explained due to ""missing"" sleep, or even really tolerance, so what's going on? The title ""rebound"" sleepiness, just trying to figure out how I ended up in such a terrible situation with this sleepiness.

[I'm posting this in r/Nootropics because I don't think this chem should be promoted any more to people of r/Drugs due to it's nature. However I believe

I recently tried out Amfonelic Acid. I'm sorry for the long wait. It took ages to arrive. Three weeks to the UK

Anyway I've had a few trials with it and if it wasn't a goddamn anti-biotic I'd still be on it! I should make some warnings here. It is very addictive and it is also an anti-biotic. This means that if you take it for a number of days/weeks/months it could cause serious damage. We just don't know the extent to which it is effective. At 20-30mg it is a selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor but is it effective as an anti-biotic at 10mg or 1000? 

If 10mg then we need to be very careful

If 1000mg then we may be able to indulge further and I hope to god this is the case but even so it will be habit forming and aforementioned outcomes could still arise after hearty addictions have been filled.

Now that's out of the way I can get around to describing this magnificent bastard. After an allergy/potency test at ~2mg, well almost nothing. I felt a slight rise in energy
and euphoria but close to maybe one cup of coffee or 40mg speed (~50% purity but cut with caffeine so it would be hard to gauge in comparison to adderall
that as a rough medium dosage before starting out.

The next day I pushed it to 30. There was definite action here. Like the previous day, euphoric you could say and to a substantial degree. It was wonderful. After an hour or so I jumped another barrier and insufflated 10mg. It hit quickly but it only seemed to extend the action, possibly elevating it only slightly. Total duration of 8-10 hours including extension.

It's very smooth with no stimulation in the normal sense of the word but it certainly was a cognitive enhancer. Everything seemed so fluid and easy to access. A really wonderful drug. I felt like I could do everything but I just wanted to relax at the time. Not like with speed where I have impetus and drive to work. The day after I found it was tugging at me again. ""Just a little"" it said

A week after prior ingestions I have taken 45mg orally. It set in quickly after about 30 minutes but didn't really show full effects until about 45 minutes to an hour later. This dose really is the upper end of the scale

I think taking into account the second

My principle reasoning for knowing that it's a high dose is due to my heart rate and a decline of skill when playing FPS games (an unfortunate side effect of higher doses of stimulants). I can of course feel the strong stimulant effects but it's still unbelievably smooth. Euphoria is high but mind is clear. A similar dose of speed (relative to bpm) would have me pushed to the limit, muscles are tensed up and my mind is rushing a mile a minute causing me to freak out every five seconds. With AFA there is none of that. My mind is focussed, my hands are a little jittery but it's nothing serious,  I'm a little concerned for my overall wellbeing but aside from that no strong paranoia or anxiety. The complete lack of norepinephrine gives such wonderful insight into the dimensions of heavy dopamine increase which I am more than happy to experience.

It's beautiful, but with this I'm fairly content to keep my mind on one thing. There is a fair bit of muscle tension resulting in jaw aches moving my extremities to release energy. The action of the drug seems to be waning 
but I would expect similar tension on this level of any stimulant. 

At about the 6-7 hour point I am beginning to come down but again the main reason I can tell is due to a lower heart rate at 114bpm. I think I should be back to baseline at the 10 hour point. At T+ 8hrs I'm still fairly stimulated but my heart rate is lower at 108bpm

T+10hrs: Still stimulated. The tension started to piss me off so an hour ago I dropped 80mg codeine to smoothen it out. It's been effective for the most part. The AFA while seeming to slowly die out kept up until the very end. At 14 hours my heart rate was at 102bpm and I didn't sleep until the 15th hour but not through lack of trying.

The experience mentioned in the Bluelight thread said a duration of 5-6 hours at an average dose so this also demonstrates both my error in judgement and it's power at this dose. However I would imagine baseline would be reached at perhaps eight hours for an average dose and six hours is just the duration for noticeable effects. I reckon a perfect dose at this (slightly lower than last week) tolerance level is between 30 and 40mg threshold around 10mg and at previous trial tolerance level between 35 and 45mg.

This compound would be a wonderful study aid and general drug of abuse and most likely subsequent addiction if it weren't for those antibiotic effects which is probably for the best in all honesty. I would love to know how strong it actually is as an antibiotic but I still don't think I'd risk using it for more than a few days if it did have a higher dose for those effects. It's not worth the potential risk when there are other similar compounds available. The price alone would outweigh the gain

* Studying MBA
* As a child I was thought to have some form of attention deficit issue. 
* Smoker

Source:
OTC piracetam 800mg. I live in a country where it is prescription only but that means you just have to say please when you ask for them OTC

Dosage:
Day 1 3.2 mg
Day 2 3.2 mg
Day 3 3.2 mg

Other:
Melatonin (1 day)
Fish oil

Experience:
While I understand that it can take several weeks to get to a level in my system where it shows the greatest effect


* What I have learnt so far
* Although I experienced some of the effect of piracetam they where not as grandiose as some people describe in their first couple of days taking them. 
* I was studying for an exam which was on my second day of experimentation. I had some major issues with recall
* I did see some vibrancy which people describe with colours but that lasted only for an hour. 
* However contrary to the above
* Anxiety is lower.
* Energy seems higher. 5 minutes after waking up I am active
* No longer taking redbull
* I am 183 cm (6'2) and 110 kg (~240lb). I strangely enough do not eat a lot
* Although piracetam is OTC
* I found myself dancing to music .... I don't dance it is number 1 in my rule book. But I know some people have said they feel music with more clarity. 
* I noticed that I seem to be engaging people more in conversation. This is unusual as I am a quiet person and living in a country where my native language English is a second language. 
* Frequent urination
* No lucid dreams.

My initial impressions are

It is definitely no NZT :) but I was not expecting that. I am thinking or looking for some further things I can experiment with next month

So far I think it is working

Notes:

* Keeping a journal
* Creating a list of books to read ( thought I would try a reading experiment as I am horrible at reading )

I noticed that caffeine/L-theanine is the recommended starting stack according to this subreddit's FAQ, with the effect that prolonged use wears out your brain prematurely. Is this true? If so, does L-theanine counteract this long-term damage? If not, why is caffeine considered a nootropic; after all, one of the criteria for being a nootropic is that the substance in question should be non-toxic or have low toxicity. Caffeine on the other hand has an LD50 of ~150-200mg/kg in humans.

Over the course of two prescriptions

Of course

For those who do not take stimulants, amphetamines stimulate the frontal lobe and absorb more information, do more work, to become 'stronger.' But like a sore muscle, my brain could not keep up with the constant stimulation. I experienced mood swings, depression, and brain fog due to the inability of my brain to keep up

So, having taken Pramiracetam several months before, so my decision was confident. I also ordered a new choline source, Alpha GPC, which is supposed to be the most efficient choline source available on the market.

I began to dose 750mg of Aniracetam with roughly 300mg of Alpha GPC twice daily. This was adjusted to 1000mg of Aniracetam with 600mg Alpha GPC as I responded well to both supplements and I am currently taking both alongside my Vyvanse prescription.

On Aniracetam and Alpha GPC

But the soothing action of the nootropics I was looking for was surpassed by their individual mechanisms.

On Aniracetam, I make music, I create ideas and write out models, sketches, etc. but nothing ever sticks. On the second day of Aniracetam, I cranked out a beautiful drawing of caliber I never knew I could accomplish. I was able to retain focus for hours and stay intrigued.

Also, I notice a new synergy when I smoke weed. The Aniracetam and Alpha GPC combo seems to destroy my tolerance and make one joint feel like two or three. My 'high' now feels extremely clean and efficient and I am completely level headed and in control. No saying stupid shit, no feeling trapped inside a bubble of feeling. I feel that before, weed would make me feel stuck in my head like a stick in the mud. Now, it's as if I am jumping off a springboard into the skies.

I have also noticed an increased appreciation in the world around me. I prefer to take the 'scenic road' whether that be on my bike or on a walk due to the joy I get out of looking up into the trees or even admiring the kitchiness of the suburban houses around me.

Maybe I am looking for a better explanation:

I was born an introvert

For me

Take this story as a cautious success. Deeply research each supplement before you purchase and try to understand how it will effect your life. Only then will you appreciate the true power of these nootropics.

There is one bad effect - I'm more arguable in a bad way.

In my first two months of Piracetam use I experienced typical effects such as mental clarity, synergy with caffiene, improved memory, the ability to instantly wake up clear-headed from sleep, and improved focus. From time to time I noticed increased verbal flow as well as increased visual color saturation.

In comes Magnesium L-Threonate. I wasn't expecting noticeable effects right off the bat

Another effect I'm beginning to notice is increased short term and long term memory. I'm reading three different books right now and I don't have to use bookmarks anymore, as well as the other job processes required. The people I work with say that it takes most people a month before they reach my level of understanding, and that I picking up on everything extremely quickly.

I have been taking it for about three days now. I do not have a reliable measuring system for small amounts of powder so I have been mixing about half a tsp of it with orange juice or water and taking that twice a day. These are the effects I've felt.

* Increased alertness/sharpness of mind. Whatever you want to call it

* Effects of things that would usually make me unmotivated/sluggish/lazy etc such as hangovers or the headrush after  the first cigarette of the day have been greatly reduced. While I can feel the effect

* Sleep: While I am prone to night-owl sleep patterns that push later into the morning all the time

* On the plus side of the sleep thing

1376186338.0,1k4el2,Experience with Rhodiola and Creatine,theonlywayforward,20,1,9,"I'm posting just to give the community some reports on my experiences with these nootropics:


I'm 18, doing strength training 2-3x a week and doing cardio 2x a week. I sleep about 7-9 hours a night. 


I purchased Rhodiola Rosea and Creatine Monohydrate from Smartpowders.com. It arrived pretty promptly

I purchased Rhodiola because I was looking for a nootropic that was more stimulating after my sedating experience with Bacopa. I purchased Creatine because I wanted to see its effects on my strength training and cardio and on my weight.






My experiences thus far with both have been pretty satisfactory:


1) Rhodiola is interesting. I feel it strongly when I'm sleep deprived


 It also helped a TON with caffeine withdrawal. Eliminated the headache I get from even minor caffeine withdrawal (a week of 100mg a day)and got rid of the fatigue and tiredness that accompanies that withdrawal. Basically made the withdrawal a lot more convenient.


On days I'm not sleep deprived or withdrawing from caffeine

So for me


As a sidenote






2) Creatine was unexpectedly effective for me as a nootropic. I also turned out to be a responder to creatine in terms of muscular endurance

Its mental effects were similar to Rhodiola's. I felt less tired if I had it when sleep deprived or stressed. I tried both separately and then together

So that was awesome :)

It also made my dreams really vivid. I've started to lucid dream somewhat frequently

It has helped a TON with short term endurance in cardio. The first 5 minutes of my run I'm doing really fast with a lot less perceived effort and discomfort. I also recover more quickly between sprints or short runs


Overall


TL;DR

Rhodiola is great if I'm tired but otherwise is lackluster. Creatine is great all the time.

I've been a light sleeper all my life. I usually roll in bed for an hour before falling asleep unless I'm super tired or take sleep aid. Since I started taking nootropics my sleep improved a lot.

I've had some odd aches in the liver region so I decided to come off everything and get checked out. It turned out to be just trapped gas so nothing to worry about however I did notice an odd effect.

I've been off everything for 5 days now and all 5 nights I fell asleep as soon as my head hit the pillow

So if I was to rate my sleep quality it would go like this:

Prior to nootropics: 5

On nootropics: 7

Off nootropics: 9

&gt; N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) is a precursor to the essential amino acid, it can increase blood and brain levels of cysteine. Preclinical data, case reports, and clinical studies indicate potential benefits of NAC for the treatment of addictions, bipolar depression, schizophrenia, autism, tri-chotillomania, and environmental toxic exposures.


&gt; NAC plays important roles in metabolic pathways believed to contribute to psychi-atric disorders:

&gt; 1. By increasing levels of brain cysteine

&gt; 2. Oxidative stress has been implicated as contributing to psychiatric disorders.

&gt; Glutathione (GSH) is the body’s main endogenous antioxidant. As a precursor to GSH, NAC directly scavenges reactive oxygen species.

&gt; 3. Inflammatory cytokines play a role in brain aging and psychiatric disorders. NAC has anti-inflammatory effects that may occur via antioxidant activities or other direct effects on inflammatory pathways.

&gt; Side effects and adverse reactions:

&gt; At clinically relevant doses, but this has not been reported in human studies. Overdose of NAC was associated with seizures. However, in low doses NAC is antiepileptic.

&gt;    


Then for the amide form: http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23472882

&gt; Over six decades, membrane permeability and antioxidant property. Recent studies have demonstrated the blood brain barrier permeability and therapeutic potentials of NACA in neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Multiple sclerosis, Tardive dyskinesia and HIV associated neurological disorders. In addition, NACA displays protective effect against pulmonary inflammation and antibiotic induced apoptosis. Forthcoming research on the possible therapeutic properties of NACA and its generics in the management of pathologies associated with extracellular matrix degradation and oxidative stress-related inflammation is highly exiting. Superior bioavailability of NACA is likely to fulfill the promises of NAC as well as a molecule to improve the endurance and resident time of bioscaffolds and biomaterials.

1350322199.0,11iqlk,First day ever on nootropics.  Had a very bad experience.  Could use some advice.,lanbanger,20,1,50,"Today was my first day using nootropics.  I capped up my own piracetam

  * Pyritinol: 470-550mg x 1 cap
  * CDP Choline: ~300mg x 2 caps (so approx 600mg in total)
  * Piracetam: approx 600-700mg x 3 caps  (approx 2g in total)

Within an hour of taking them I was starting to feel the effects and they were not good.  I had a high pulse rate, and I spent the entire morning feeling like I was having an out-of-body experience.  I quite literally felt like I was floating outside of myself, and it was very much like a dream - I kept having to remind myself that if people asked me questions then I needed to answer, that it wasn't a dream.  It was taking me minutes to remember things that I'd done only a few days before.  One thing occurred to me, I had also had a reasonable sized coffee at the same time as I took my 'noots' (coffee being an automatic morning ritual).

The effect eventually started wearing off around 7-8 hours later, although still a bit 'wired'.

So I would like some advice

Thanks for your help!

UPDATE:  I experimented with another pyritinol again today, there was some evidence of a rash on my face. Finally, I went to the bathroom and my piss was red hot - I think it might be inducing hyperthermia, which would explain the crazily dry mouth and general dizzyness.  ",,False,,1353089723.0,t3_11iqlk

I've known about piracetam and I have taken it on and off over the last 11-12 years or so.  I'm now about 35
* depression (mild to medium)
* focus and concentration - I get overwhelmed by the sheer complexity of what I have to do (write database software)
* procrastination from the overwhelmedness
* possibly learned helplessness

I think a lot of this is depression induced.  I think I have a ""depressive brain"", and a bunch of other things I have had a lot of challenges.  It is a nasty feedback loop.

I've been taking 5htp for a few months now.  I find it takes about 1 week to build up and it can really help the mood.  It somewhat helps with focus, but it isnt busting thru strongly.  It works better than caffine, but it isnt giving me a lot in the motivation/focus/etc area.

A week ago I started taking 3.2g of piracetam a day, without feeling like I'm a loser who is also a failure at my chosen career.  It is pretty amazing - a major improvement.  Before just thinking of writing code feels so hard that I want to avoid it.  Now instead I have written more code in 3 days than the previous 2 months!  It's really scary how bad things have gotten.

I just wanted to say that I hadn't kept at the piracetam in the past because I felt like it wasnt really helping me.  But I'm obviously going to stay on it this time.  I've ordered 1kg bulk and it should be here soon!  I also ordered some noopept just for kicks as well.

This is mostly my experience

- I am taking Choline Bitartrate (from GNC i know but I needed a fast local source)
- I am taking 3.2g piracetam a day.  This could be considered an attack dose.  Should I up or diminish the dose after a week?
- Provigil can be helpful for awakefulness
- Is is possible/wise to mix in noopept with piracetam?  With provigil? All 3?

I was just looking for some advice on which nootropics offer the best high energy returns with focus being a second desirable feature. I've just found out that, particularly as I can't expect delivery of such before I start so I just need help finding something suitable to get me used to the initial workload. The work is in biotech so I need to remain somewhat focussed too and it can't be anything that would throw up red flags during a drug test. Here are my current thoughts:

* Synthetic B-vitamins. For starters I was thinking of these which have a superior profile for passing the blood brain barrier such as salbutiamine which I had good albeit fleeting benefits from.


* Rhodiola Rosea for stress alleviation and energy if I can get the dosage right.


* Theanine and caffeine for stress alleviation and energy. 


* Phosphatidylserine reduce cortisol levels and possibly increase energy levels.


* Centella asiatica, stress reduction.


* Also


* Ginkgo biloba. Improves concentration even if tolerance develops rapidly.


* Acetlycarnitine and Alpha-lipoc acid improve comprehension and general cognition


* Phenylalanine with adequate B3


* ALCAR: I have some but every time I take it I get pretty bad headaches so choline supplementation is probably not for me. Possibly because of my love of eggs.


* Lion's mane. More of a long term supplement improving brain function through apparently stimulating nerve growth factor and myelination.

Background:
I'm a college student who's experienced a certain mental dullness in recent months, good food, time for hobbies).  I even ceased my anxiety med to hopefully to live healthy and sober.  None of that helped.

I've suffered from depression in the past, I believe my anxiety causes me to freeze and dither, while my treatment has left me lethargic (but happier).  Overall, I'd say I'm better with treatment, but I need an option that will manage anxiety without sedation.  

I have a small amount of experience with Nootropics from a few years ago, and Hydergine.  All of those left me wanting, so I gave up on them.  I have used various non-traditional Noots for Noot purposes, but mostly caffeine is my mainstay.

Enter Noopept.  From all the reviews I've read, simply, and quickly.  My only concerns are sexual side effects that some have reported and are an issue with nefiracetam.

I purchased 10g from CerebralHealth.  The Noopept came in a ziploc baggie inside of a sealed foil pouch.  I am not impressed by the packaging.  I may go with another vendor in the future.

The powder is very clumpy and smells like a dull mushroom musk.  The taste is not puke-worthy

Day 1:  
Yesterday evening, but I did feel more relaxed and happier.  I was also better able to recall information than normal, but we'll see how that plays out.

Day 2:  
I took a scoop (roughly twice the size of previous) on an empty stomach this morning.  Again

I took another dose similar to morning dose about 15 minutes ago.  washed it down with chocolate syrup and water.  That worked well. 

Oh, for some reason they were giving out 5-hour Energy on campus today.  I saved it to stack with Noopept sometime.

I'm having great success with my piracetam stack. It's worked wonders for numerous reasons and overall it's going very well. My questions are for a close family member.

Summarizing as best as I can, prodding, tests and psychiatric help as well as being prescribed a cocktail of medication. She has flown off the handle for a bit and had a breakdown for the past 4 or so years - being emotionally unstable, unwillingness to 'seize the day' with a preference to staying in bed and sleeping. As.well as all this, she's also been diagnosed with Fibromyalgia. 

Doctors are at a point where they are unwilling to help

I can give more of a back-story if necessary but that's the basis of my reasoning for asking for help. She has contacted me recently after a couple of motivational speeches given by me, alot of them are only really masking the symptoms instead of treating them), and start recovering instead of hiding away. This is fantastic news, I can tell she means it. 

She's come over today after not seeing her in a while and I've shown her the magic of piracetam

However, she will be talking to her doctor as well, but I'm theorizing he will only roll his eyes and imply she is rejecting help. 

Her current list of medications are as follows: Ramipril (5mg a day), Tramadol (400mg per day), Zopiclone (15mg a day), aswell as Hormone Replacement Therapy. 

**EDIT**: Also Fluoxetine was mentioned as she boarded the train - Dose wasn't mentioned.

Obviously some of these may require a tapering off

**UPDATE**: The Fibromyalgia 'diagnosis' was never confirmed. I'm pretty sure the stress of being bounced from doctor to doctor (some of which have been dismissive

I speculate that GPs have prescribed these things to mask issues and have given up serious treatment 'because of her history'

She has 35 years experience in a medical field with the last 10 being a midwife and she seemed to show great excitement after I had explained piracetam to her.

Any serious advice and I would be most grateful

Choline acetyltransferase (CAT) is markedly reduced in the brains of Alzheimer's patients.

CAT is far from saturated under normal circumstances, has been reported to be less.

Alzheimers’s patients and age-matched controls revealed a severe loss of neurons in the nucleus 
basalis of Meynert (located within the substantia innominata). This brain area is thought to provide the primary cholinergic input to the cortical mantle.

Sodium-dependent, choline uptake did not differ in young and aged hippocampus. Further, no age-related differences were observed in either choline or acetylcholine levels. These results suggest a decrease in  the  activity  of septo-hippocampal cholinergic neurons.

Alterations in the cholinergic system do not occur with Alzheimer's disease to any further extent than that which occurs with natural aging.

Results from these animal studies (rodent) seem reasonably consistent; of the six reports that have been published

Single-cell recordings revealed that both acetylcholine and glutamic acid iontophoretically applied stimulated pyramidal cell firing rate in proportion to ejection current. However

The primary pharmacological data supporting an important cholinergic involvement in this deficit is that blockade of  central muscarinic receptors induce a deficit in young subjects which is qualitatively similar to that occurring naturally in  aged  subjects.

Studies demonstrated that the deficit produced by scopolamine can be partially

Cell loss in the locus coeruleus with normal aging and subgroups of senile patients supports this possibility. Given that the locus coeruleus provides a major norepinephrine input to the cortex and has independently been associated with performance of learned tasks in rodents.

A number of in vitro studies indicate that under certain conditions, only one claims substantial improvement (about 60 percent of patients tested). Ten did not obtain facilitative effects on the cognitive tasks. Although some investigators claim that positive trends seemed to  exist  in some small subpopulation of  the  subjects, the effects of the precursors are far from impressive, particularly in  well-controlled, double-blind studies.

Studies with physostigmine in aged subjects have also demonstrated reliable facilitation of performance on memory tasks.  Contrary to the effects of physostigmine in young subjects

The muscarinic agonist arecoline has been evaluated for effects on performance in memory tasks. After receiving a single injection of arecoline young adult volunteers exhibited significant improvement in ability to recall recently learned verbal material.

Arecoline improved short term memory in Alzheimer’s patients as well as monkeys. In the monkey study

Choline has weak muscarinic agonist effects.

Cholinergic dysfunction that contributes to the age-related memory deficit may prevent choline from being effectively converted into acetylcholine in the aged brain. This may be even more true in Alzheimer's disease, however, serious deficiencies could impair conversion of plasma choline to intraneuronal acetylcholine.

Choline uptake

Decreases in glucose utilization and oxidative metabolism may decrease the ability of the aged brain to synthesize acetyl  CoA

[13 month old] mice were trained on a single-trial passive avoidance task and tested for retention either 24 hours or 120 hours later. Their performance was compared with that of mice of various ages that were maintained on a control diet.  Two salient findings were  observed: (i) a  dramatic decrease in  retention of  the  task  was observed  in  the  senescent  mice  (23 months and older) and (ii) marked differences occurred between the choline-deficient  and  choline-enriched groups (13 months old). The choline-enriched mice performed as well as 3-month-old mice, more general changes in neuronal membranes (or their functions) could have contributed to the deficits

Choline converts into acetylcholine more readily under conditions of increased neuronal activity. Activity of certain cholinergic pathways may be reduced in aged subjects. Although normal cholinergic activity depends on intact oxidative metabolism

Several lines of pharmacological evidence indicate that piracetam enables the CNS  to  function more  effectively under hypoxic conditions and improves performance in oxygen-deprived or aged animals. Neurochemical determinations suggest piracetam may facilitate conversion of adenosine diphosphate to adenosine triphosphate. Other tests indicate that piracetam also enhances intercerebral neuronal activity and may deplete hippocampal tissue acetylcholine levels
Fischer 344 rats administered saline, or combinations of each for 1 week; retention of a one-trial passive avoidance task was measured. Aged Fisher 344 rats had previously been shown to suffer severe impairments on this task as a natural consequence of aging. Further, evaluations of performance after various retention intervals demonstrated that the performance of the aged rats was comparable to that of young rats when tested within a hour after training, but decreased sharply, exhibiting severe deficits within 4 hours after training. The scores of those rats administered only choline did not differ from those of control rats given saline. Although the rats administered piracetam were improved subtly over the saline and choline groups, the retention scores of rats administered the choline-piracetam mixture were several times as high as those of  rats  given  piracetam alone.
Increased choline availability in aged animals may be greatly enhanced by the simultaneous administration of a pharmacological agent purported to enhance oxidative metabolism [piracetam].

Clinical trial based on these preliminary animal data found significant improvement in three of ten mild to moderate Alzheimer' s  patients treated for  1 week with combined choline and piracetam and all three responders exhibited unusually high  choline  levels  in  red blood cells (but not plasma) relative to nonresponders.

Preliminary neurochemical assays performed on the brains from the behaviorally tested animals revealed modest regionally specific changes in choline and acetylcholine with the combination

Preliminary data from aged rats suggest that solutions to this problem [age related memory loss] may not be simple, the balance or tone between two or more neurotransmitter systems may need to be improved.

During the change-over we will still have the classic Alpha Brain® formula available in 90ct jars, and it will be designated as ""Classic."" All package deals will include the new formula, and may have 3 (30ct) bottles substituted for 1 (90ct) jar until the new formula is available in jars.


We are extremely excited to introduce Phosphatidylserine (PS), phosphatidylserine is found as part of the cell membrane of cells, most notably found in the cell membrane of neurons. Our PS is sourced sustainably and ethically from soy.
L-tyrosine has replaced Mucuna Pruriens as a precursor to the production of L-dopa. With an impeccable safety profile and powerful efficacy


L-theanine is one of the major reasons why green tea is much smoother than any other caffeinated beverage. Closely related to the GABA mechanism and easily absorbed by the body


To further make room for our all-star ingredients, and GPC.


I would like to personally thank all of our tens of thousands of amazing customers for their feedback over the last year that has allowed us to perfect this revolutionary flagship formula.

The stack that worked for me. comments/suggestions welcome. ,Toppguy,18,3,25,"I researched and wrote a very eloquent paper today taking 3 sources from different medias and evaluating the arguments in each one to make a clear and coherent report on the Current day depictions of masculinity in media and its lasting effects on American Culture. I did this very fast

(I do beleive the Trimethylglycine aided the focus from the stimulants by modulating serotonin levels


* 1500mg Hawthorne berry (to combat vasoconstriction brought upon by ephedrine) -move aside l-arginine

* 25mg Ephedrine 

* 200mg caffeine

* 81mg aspirin (cheap insurance against circulatory stress)
 
* 300mg adrafinil (metabolizes into ~100mg modafinil in the body- used for speed reading) 

* 3g piracetam (to help verbal memory and writing eloquence while typing paper) 

* 1.5g trimethylglycine (improve liver function under stress and to help methylation of serotonin) 

* 2g piracetam in a tall glass of water and ""sipped on"" during the two hour process. to replace the pira lost from the diuretic effect of caffeine. 


I could NOT sit down at my computer before taking the ECA stack. I would much rather take an doctor prescribed dose of an appropriate ADHD medication that would have less cardiovascular stress associated with it - that would be much less... deadly. 

Without piracetam it is difficult to execute the instructions of the assignment in a logical manner

Without the adrafinil, cleaning ones room may take priority in the event that too much stimulation causes a diminishing return on academic priority. Modifinil is not a stimulant, but in the simplest terms it enhances any process in which the brain is currently working on. So if an individual is reading, the process of reading is greatly aided. Ten pages fly by without so much as even one intrusive, distracting thought. So it helped me research the sources I used to write the paper.

Trimethylglycine is taken mainly to increase the power of piracetam (a self-discovery I am proud of) and also aids in the production of acetylcholine in the body which is an important chemical used in the brain for many functions including memory. In addition trimethylglycine improves liver function which is a nice benefit to have when dumping the amount of drugs/supplements into my body –the most liver-stressing one being adrafinil. 

In conclusion the cumulative “stack” I used to write a paper was pretty successful, which are mainly: bronchodilation, diuretic effects, appetite suppression, and vasoconstriction. 

My poor performance is most likely (99% chance) the result of bad habits during high school and would best be corrected by behavioral change rather than drug and supplementation treatment. However at this current period in the academic there is no time to “learn” how to study and perform and prioritize academic tasks as my scholarships require a yearly cumulative GPA of 3.0 and 3.25 respectively. I have no room for failure or even sub-excellence this semester. This is why I have undergone the supplementation above. There is however a Brightside which is the simple ability to LEARN and memorize what this mental supplementation feels like - Taken as a learning experience

I'll leave evaluation of safety up to the discretion of the reader.  This is simply an objective summary of what has been reported in the literature.

Human Equivalent Doses are decided using a 5'8""



**Jindo et al

&gt;Thirteen week toxicity study on rats, seen in both 120 and 480mg/kg doses.  480mg/kg dose also showed salivation, prone position, increased water consumption and increased levels of serum proteins associated with toxicity.  

&gt;Study concluded 30mg/kg was the non-toxic dose under the given experimental conditions.  30mg/kg/d in rats is equivalent to 1.95 grams in humans

**Hooks et al

&gt;52 week study in dogs, 30 and 90 mg/kg/d.  Systemic toxicity were not apparent until the second half of the study.  In the 90mg/kg dosage, these included higher urea nitrogen and creatine, higher urinary volumes with lower specific gravity/osmolarity/protein.  Histology examination showed changes in kidneys (renal papilla, collecting ducts, medullary and cortical scarring).  Also showed decreased spermatogenesis in testes, decreased/missing spermatozoa in epididymides.

&gt;Similar toxicity was found in one male animal at the 30mg/kg dose

**Watanabe et al

&gt;Summary:  nefiracetam does bad things to the fetuses of pregnant rats and rabbits in fairly large doses.  No surprise there.  I don't think anyone is advocating taking these supplements while pregnant

**Sugawara et al

&gt;Single-dose toxicity study, 500mg/kg in dogs.  Toxic signs included reduced locomotor activity, inability to stand up.  No apparent pathological changes upon examination.

&gt;Human equivalent of 500mg/kg in dogs is 32 grams.  Don't eat that much ;)

**Hooks et al

&gt;Hooks again, 10, 30, 100 and 300 mg/kg.  As with the other study, systemic toxicity changes were found primarily in the kidney (papillary/collecting duct epithelial hyperplasia, cortical scarring, mineralisation of papilla.  Also hypertrophy of the liver hepatocytes.  Other tissues showing systemic changes include salivary glands, spleen

&gt;Study concluded 10mg/kg was the non-toxic dose under the given experimental conditions.  Human equivalent dose of 10mg/kg in rats is 650mg.

**The Megadose Dog Studies**

&gt;There are a slew of studies where dogs are given a pretty hefty dosage of nefiracetam for extended periods of time.  The average dose was 300mg/kg/d, liver hypertrophy.  These are obviously not dose ranges that are physiologically relevant and were performed mostly to determine the mechanism of renal failure, not the safety range of nefiracetam.

&gt;These studies include the infamous ""testicular toxicity"" claims.  The causes of decreased spermatozoa was found to be caused by a decrease in testosterone.  While these doses were abnormally large


**Shimada et al

&gt;Reported slight chromosomal aberrations while using in vitro tests.  Can probably ignore this paper - a lot of things are mutagenic when applied directly to cells in vitro.
