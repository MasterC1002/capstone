Well

Now, but research found they generally make 50 cents to $2 an hour) As a matter of fact, I read that Honda has paid inmates $2 an hour for doing the same work an auto worker would get paid $20 to $30 an hour to do! That's just insane. Upon further reading, I learned prisons have their hands in MANY industries from clothing production to telemarketing!  After the initial outrage settled, I started to think about just how fucked up this situation is. 

Not only are prisoners being seriously exploited

Next

So now we have worker/prisoner exploitation and economic disaster! great. But that's not it. This private prison industry also promotes the obtaining of prisoners in the first place! Arresting people now seems to me like some sort of sick hiring process instead of punishment for legitimate crime. 

Here is one article I found on it. http://www.wsws.org/articles/2000/may2000/pris-m08.shtml

There are many more if you google.

1373992285.0,1if79m,My dinner with Paul Volcker to discuss post-scarcity economics of The Technocopia Plan [UPDATE],hephaestusness,97,15,107,"To begin with [PROOF](http://imgur.com/a/7yqTV)

This was the meeting described in [this post from 3 months ago](http://www.reddit.com/r/occupywallstreet/comments/1arzzd/1er_here_that_won_an_auction_benefiting_the_rfk/). It turned out that due to health problems the fishing trip got boiled down to a long dinner conversation

As a preface

The meeting began with a discussion of robotics. One of the contracts my company does is for control systems for [neurosurgery frameworks](http://aimlab.wpi.edu/research/) (skip to 0:33 in the video). A friend of his has cerebral palsy so i was able to discuss with him how the robotic assisted therapy works. From there we segued into robotics and automation of the economy. 

I laid out the basic thesis from [Race Against the Machine](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-store/dp/B005WTR4ZI) in that the rate at which we are eliminating jobs is faster then a human can be trained for any new job. I then further claimed that projects like the Technocopia Plan and [Open Source Ecology](http://opensourceecology.org/) will leverage the community of labor to design the new manufacturing backbone. On top of that, and free and effectively infinite (emphasis on effectively) material source streams. (since this is not a tech sub, i will spare you all the details of how that will work)

The response was surprising. In response to ""It seems we just have more people than are needed to make ever increasing productive capacity, so that was not hard though)

We then discussed ideas like disconnecting a citizens ability to exert demand in the economy from employment, when i misspoke about how the Friedman negative income tax, i was quickly and forcefully corrected. I had accidentally said everyone gets the same income, but what i meant was that everyone got at least a bare minimum, supplemented by negative taxes. This correction was good because it meant he was not just being polite listening to me, he was engaged and willing to correct anything he heard that was out of place. 

Over all, he was FUNNY. He made jokes and carried on a very interesting conversation. Even if he had not previously been the chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, i would have enjoyed my conversation with him. 

Thank you to /u/m0rph3u5 and Reddit for making this happen!
