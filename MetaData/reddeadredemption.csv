Now I don't own a PS3 (pc master race) but there is a console back at my parents house for my siblings. My parents are very *""meh""* towards gaming in general despite my attempts to get them to play some of the latest releases.  
   
  
Sat down and loaded the game up. Dad walks in during the intro and asks what I am doing. *""New Game""*, and then either kick me out or head to the back room TV. But he is really into westerns and I could see him getting interested.  
   
  
Watch the whole opening sequence, spam X and my horse bucks me off. Dad laughing at me but I could tell he was enjoying himself. Posse arrests me and takes me to jail. I am super impressed with the visuals, and the passage of time while sitting in the cell.  
   
  
Get released -&gt; don't have enough money to pay off fines so have to go kill some guy. Ride out into the desert and track down my target, the way the enemies die and react to hit locations. This was the moment I really felt myself getting hooked. Kill the target and search him, cool.  
   
  
Heading back to town and a guy calls out from the side of the road. Dad demands I stop to see what he wants. His wagon crashed and 2 convicts escaped, and then shoot up everyone in the room. Everyone runs from the saloon and the Law surrounds it, another awesome shootout occurs. Get shot and killed ....  
   
  
Dad laughs at me and then realises he has been watching me play a game for a about 2 hours. Asks me how to setup the PS3 so he can *""maybe""* have a go later ... . Show him how. Feels good =D.

1274323508.0,c65jo,The Redditors guide to Red Dead Redemption. ,,35,4,66,"Post your Red Dead Redemption tips:

♦Drinking around ten drinks (two dollars each) will get you drunk. Bumping into people while drunk is a almost certain way to get challenged to a duel. 

♦Tired of Poker? Early on (supposedly) the only other place to try other card/dice games is Thieves Landing. Thieves Landing boasts Blackjack and Liars dice. 

♦Throwing knives *can* be used in Dead Eye. 

♦Short on the money? Liars dice is a great way to make money. At Thieves landing (if you win) you get $20 for each person eliminated for a fairly easy game. 

♦Trouble locating a tailor for an outfit? Open up the outfit menu and press X (for the Xbox

♦You can swap weapons in the same category by pressing Left or Right on the D-Pad while highlighting the weapon with the weapon wheel. 

♦While being bad is fun, hardly any cash and having a $6,000 bounty with every lawman trying to gun you down does not make it easy. 

♦The Lasso is badass. Throwing it at people is fun. But even merely aiming it at someone, tying up is assault or something along the lines of that) 

♦You DONT need to buy guns. Seriously. You can

♦Out of ammo? The lasso is a great way to get some easy ammo. Toss it around someone and walk backwards, killing them and getting their ammo from their body.

♦Looking for a stealthy way to kill? Target someone with a knife and come up behind. Attack and you will perform a throat slit.

♦You can only get the ""Dastardly"" achievement if the train is going at full speed. Putting the woman in front of a stopped train and waiting for it to move will not net you the gamerscore.

After Harold came Terrance. Terrance was blonde, a mighty steed that had accompanied me on many missions and hunting trips. It was my personal desire to keep him throughout the game in order to unlock the achievement. Plus he was fast and didn’t mind too much when I accidentally shot him in the ass a few times while chasing wolves. All around a good horse.
I was in Pike’s Basin last night killing and looting, Terrance burst from the cliff soaring through the air like a cow without wings and came crashing to the valley floor in a crumpled heap of horse. I ran over to him and cursed his stupidity, but didn’t have the stomach to skin him.

After awhile I acquired my third horse, killing him and throwing me on the ground. Damn cougars! The train and the cougar both got away and I stood on the train tracks alone. Awesome.

Hey, or emotional, or surprising. 

So I thought I'd start a discussion here. What do people think of the story

It's been a year or so since I've played it, and you can't be redeemed or magically absolved of your past sins**. Essentially that redemption is impossible-although, you can certainly become a better person and do good acts that might even *outweigh* the bad acts, they don't just magically erase them.

That's built up through the whole game, but they killed him anyway because they still considered him dangerous. He was still one of the gang. Although he did everything he wanted, he couldn't erase his past as well. It's even more tragic when Jack, although he had the chance to be a good person entirely, became a bitter and jaded man, eventually an outlaw and a killer himself.


I think those long horseback conversations developed a lot of the themes of the game. I know the Mexico arc revolved around one

Well my Xbox got hacked when I was at 97% on rdr. Ended up selling my Xbox. Long story short just bought one solely for this game.

For some reason thought my saves would be attached to my GT. but no.

Just hit Mexico on my second time through and found this sub.

Thought I would post some tips for the newbs out there


1. You get the lasso after a couple missions with Bonnie. 

2. Buy the bandana when u get to thieve landing. Helps to put it on when you wanna mess shit up and not lose honor or fame.

3. The horse Bonnie gives you is one of the fastest in the game. There are 3 in singleplayer. ( not including war horse) try not lose it. If you do don't waste $1500 on it. Either go catch one at warthington ranch or wait till it's 750 when your honor is much higher.

4. Use dead eye. It's awesome. Press r3 to activate and just head shot alot :) 

5. When u kill anything (animal or person) If there is skinning or loot it will show up as an X on your map.

6. For people doing the challenge. You can kill things with a knife while your riding :)

7. If you stop your horse right on too of the dead animal and get off. Keep tapping to skin as your getting off the horse. It will skip the skinning cutscenes and saves alot of time. ( helping when there are cougars aroun)

8.  Don't play undead nightmare till you have finished the story line

9. Don't kill alot of people early on. Wait till you get the bandana. A $1000 bounty seems fun to get but hard to play when you are constantly being targeted by every bounty hunter in the region.

10. I kill almost every animal I see and it takes just seconds to quickly skin it when you do the trick I mentioned earlier. I have never had a problem with money and always have $500+ 

11. Don't buy guns or ammo. You always pick up enough. Even if u want that buffalo rifle. Keep playing eventually someone will drop one. And always free ammo in your safe house in the chest. Just keep saving and it respawns.

12. I only just learnt this after failing a race 5 times with a shit horse. ( apples regen your horses stamina) use them. 

13. Tabacco and whiskey regen your dead eye. Use them. 

14. You get the tomahawk in manzatina general store. If you have the legends and killers DLC.

15. Careful when you see strangers

All I got for now

Xbox GT = llamarama1st

The first and biggest tip I can share with you is do not, then so can they. If you bid high, go right out of the gate saying ""Three four's"" then they have to go four and five which makes it incredibly risky and almost certainly they will be wrong. 

Second, it has to be exactly four three's. If I am right and it is spot on, everyone except me loses a die. But if I am wrong, then I am the only one to lose a die. 

Third, they will call it out. Using this logic its possible to ""trick"" AI with a few dice to call out a legit bid. 

Fourth, it means you have to make the riskier bid. 

Fifth, that means there's one less person to beat"" but that's exactly what makes it tougher. There is one less person. Five less dice on the field. The more dice, the easier it is. When its just two its highly possible to get caught in the hole were you have to make a risky bid, but with two other people this rarely happens as they tend to call out each other very frequently. You can safely watch as they wittle each other down, then you come up and (metaphorically) curb stomp them. Hope my tips help.",,False,t5_2rn7o,True

I loaded up RDR last night knowing I'd only really have the chance to play an hour at most. Knowing that, you can go over there and it's not just a backdrop it's a really awesome feeling. 

People will disagree (it's what they do, right? 

The random events are great. I've heard the suicide talked about a few times now, unsure of what to do. Could I save him? What if I pulled out my rope and tried to tie him up? What if I went into dead eye and tried to shoot the gun out of his hand? It was too late. I watched as a man blew his brains out and fell dead across what I can only assume was his lover. I'll never really know. 

I know I'm not very far in, mostly the terrain texture fails to switch from low to high resolution instantly sometimes, but it's an amazing game, everyone should check it out.

EDITS: Already! I got in a fight with the night watch dog at one point. I tried to tie it up and it started to bite me. I beat it for a little bit and it wimpered and ran off. I went to go about my business and a minute or two later the dog came back and started biting my ass. I shot the dog and skinned it. The fine I had to pay for killing the dog was about equal to what I got for selling the dogs parts. 

I came upon some guys assaulting a lone man, but I'm really hoping to find his corpse or half eaten body there later. 

EDITS2: I killed the doctor. I was in Armadillo minding my own business, and came upon a man running with a tied up woman over his shoulder. I shot him in the leg, and he dropped the woman. I hog tied him and stuck him on the back of the horse and cut the woman free. I couldn't decide what to do with the kidnapper. I took him out into the desert and shot him once between the eyes. The back of his head ended up on a nearby rock. The doctors office hasn't opened in three days now.

By the end

I think a shortcoming in some RPGs is giving a complete blank of a protagonist for the player to fill. In this game

There was something so appealing about a man simply (if sometimes gruffly) trying to get his family back only to get caught up in a succession of other people's preoccupations. From rescuing a ranch owner's daughter, to ending an insurgency of outlaws against a dying time of the wild west, and completing a long string of side missions -- all with an undercurrent of unsettled scores -- it seemed John would never see Abigail and Jack again.

Then

And throughout all this

The missions you do with Abigail, I genuinely thought, made for a wonderful epilogue to the game. The bonding, the characterization, it all added to the experience, and I was enjoying the supposed denouement. But how wrong I was.

Before the final series of missions, and finish all the stranger side missions. I like to explore and do everything along the way. Even despite the urgency of the main plot, I never felt like I was rushed or lazy. It felt natural. Even when I stopped seemingly every couple miles to rescue someone from a plight, it felt like it fit with the milieu and added to John's character. Despite his objections, he would always help, at least in my play-through thus far (which lead to interesting consequences down the line).

So at the end when he got a visit from 'old friends, hearing about Dutch's death. When I saw I was shooting soldiers, I felt a growing dread. I was mad John had been betrayed, but it was never a sense of vulnerability. I had spent the game being invincible. This was no time to second guess John.

Then he walks out of the barn to the firing squad. That scene was perfect. Not seeing just how many soldiers there are right until the last second

I came back around as Jack. There was still the last scrap of the army uniform to buy from the Blacksmith tailor. I headed over there and saw a little question mark. Wondering how I'd missed a side mission

Then, this man didn't deserve to die. He was rotten but he only did what he believed was right. He was cold but he wasn't necessarily evil. The game had done such a wonderful job of setting up the inanity of violence and shades of grey in the world; it seemed I had come all this way through the characters' journey and discovered that bloodshed would only spur more bloodshed.

I got shot and died.

I sat there, I quickly realized that disarming would not work, and aimed for a lethal shot. Edgar sank like a rock in the river.

That was when I realized, to know what I knew of their world. And Edgar was not a man to be reasoned with. I had expected a schmaltzy, enlightened ending but it would have robbed me of the better one that the game provided.

As I got the achievement ""Nature or Nurture"" I laughed, shortly after, I hit 100% completion. But nothing could prepare me for the sense of purposelessness in Jack when there was nothing left to do in a vast, changing landscape after revenge had been claimed.",,False,self,False,t3_1gi81s

This time, I opted for throwing knives; and this time

When Lobo had his first go at me, I slashed him a few more times. Then something unexpected happened: He started limping away and whimpering like a beat up, scared dog. ""Oh no you don't,"" I said aloud ""I know you've got more fight in ya."" So I ran around to the front of him to confront him head on. Nothing. He was utterly defeated, and just kept limping past me, likely in the hopes that I'd leave him be.

But something in me wasn't clicking right. I waited a few moments. Any sane person would feel sad and stop. I felt sad and I wanted to stop--Maybe leave and come back when he had his strength back up

I know it's just a game, but that presupposes that something we can't do, we WANT to do. I've never once wanted to kill a wolf, let alone any other animal.

When I became Jack the first thing I did was ride into black water to have a game of high stakes poker to celebrate what I thought was the end game but as I rode in I saw a ? and decided what the hell.

I then realise

  So I ride out to the farm I was directed to, then pullout my high powered pistol, the one given to my father by Agent Ross.

I burn the house down as thunder rolls in the distance.

  I ride fast, what am I doing? Am I really going to do this? I see a camp fire in the distance but the man standing beside it is not Ross. I get off my horse as I get close and tell him I have a message for Ross. The man, Ross's brother, tells me he is down the river a way, hunting duck. Anger broods in me, not one more living thing will die by Edger’s hand. Without thinking I pull my pistol, time slows; I unload a full clip into Ross's brother’s body before he even touches the hilt of his gun. Blood pools around his limp corpse, I see my fathers face.

  Its not far to my final destination, I let him draw first. He falls, I don’t remember pulling the trigger, the gun is smoking in my hand.

The problem I ran into in Mexico was that once I got down to 6 of 8 bounties completed
  
I'm at 96.4% and aside from this
  
I discovered [this](http://socialclub.rockstargames.com/games/rdr/checklist.html) just last night; pretty cool of R\* I must say. Too bad none of the supposed links do anything though -- would have loved to click each of the missions to find the gold medal requirements.  
  
Anyway, it froze so I was forced to) but it made no difference. has anyone else experienced the bounty problem?  
  
---  
  
**e:** Completed it! I know this thread (and sub) is dead but I found this out through Googling so this could easily help others in the same way in the future.  
  
I did most of my bounty missions by getting close enough to make all the red markers appear on my mini-map
 
All I had to do then was get the US Marshal outfit so I now have 100%. :)  
  
---  
  
**What do you think of currency in R\* games?**  
  
While I love R\* and the games they produce
  
I played the game as a good guy so whenever a mission gave me the option of handing over some money or keeping it, I rarely bother looting dead bodies. While I've won a little bit on games, it's nothing worth talking about.  
  
So, nor looting much, I still stand here with $5.645.  
  
My stats show the following:  
  
Snake oil used - 2  
Moonshine used - 5  
Chewing tobacco used - 2  
Medicine used - 1  
Bait used - 2  
Horse pills used - 3  
  
I recall using moonshine once or twice, yet I currently own 5 x Apple; 3 x Medicine; 4 x Bait; 2 x Vittles; 2 x Tonic; 1 x Snake Oil; 1 x Moonshine and 1 x Horse Pills.  
  
So, then by selecting a horse deed. Not only that, but it auto-saves after *every* little task you complete. Furthermore, I seemed to notice that if you die in (or near?) a town, when it reloads your game, you remain at the safe-house in that town rather than whichever safe-house you last saved at (as is the case in GTA). All of those things makes extra property even more useless than the currency -- especially when most of them are in the middle of nowhere in places which missions don't even require you to go to.

So yesterday, and of course we did the hideout really quickly because our posse was so huge. And of course at the end of that hideout you get the stagecoach, right?

We all piled in and started heading off, ready to defend the coach if need be.

Well, and hit us with a stick of dynamite, killing us all and destroying the stagecoach... (these guys proceeded to follow us around the map on their Zebra Donkeys, invincible because they'd hacked so we couldn't shoot them, and scream into their mics about how WE TRIED TO KILL THEM AND THEY DIDN'T MEAN TO DO IT)

we switch sessions

it's maybe 10:30.

One of my gang lieutenants gets the idea to go to El Presidio, etc.. until another posse shows up. They're an straw yellow-green. We start shooting it out and everything's fine until their posse begins to vote to kick one of our posse members for playing ""casual."" (His targeting mode wasn't Expert and he'd just picked up the game again after a month or so.)

We all leave the area so they won't bother us and they'll leave poor Normal Targeting Mode alone. Why not go to Gaptooth Breach again

We go back, we just want the coach.""

""Why?"" say I.

""To be dicks."" so i play along, etc. and naturally they don't. They then tell us that we can have it. So reluctantly we take it. And they start ganging us and following us around the map. Sound familiar?

Switch sessions.

We do it again and one of our posse members uses the Explosive Rifle a bit too close. Stagecoach = gone.

We do it again and a randomer comes across as we're pushing the cart and they shoot the horses. Stagecoach = gone.

We do it again

We finally get the darn thing and head off to Mexico... the trouble is

at this point i realized that I probably wasn't meant to play the game today or something. So, then we all went to hunt bears with our fists. (This was maybe 1:30-2:00 AM.)

good times.

I just did that, that every time I fire a shot, it exits Dead Eye, and I have to activate it again. Is it not working because I'm exiting Dead Eye with each shot? And if so, is there a way to keep Dead Eye activated while I fire multiple rounds?

I've already tried the method using Undead Bait, but I can never get it the Dynamite or the Explosive Rifle to kill 5 undead at the same time.

I've been playing Friendly Free Roam solidly for about a week now and with the recent triple XP event I've managed to get close to my third Legend.  
  
Free Roam can be great fun if you have one or two people to regularly posse up with and hideouts are pretty easy sources of XP once you get a good rhythm going within the team. Great. Now, are Gang Matches. I've done most of the Free Roam challenges so I decided that tonight I would go for as many Weapon challenges as I could. However the whole experience just makes me hate my favourite game.  
  
Hell, I probably spend 90% of my time just trying to find a decent weapon and a Dead Eye pick-up.  
  
It's not that I'm bad; in fact, it feels more like luck than skill. I don't see why you can't just spawn with *some* Dead Eye because it's almost impossible to kill without it. As soon as you've fired your first shot, anyone with a better weapon and/or Dead Eye will just cream you.  
  
Then there's the spawn system itself. Once a good player has a powerful weapon, and the rest of the map was mostly just open space. A guy was up there repeatedly firing the cannon at us over and over as soon as we re-spawned; meanwhile his team-mates were running around collecting bags. It was pretty much impossible to get out of this cycle but eventually I managed to pick him off with no less than about 6 rifle rounds while he was busy going for my team-mate.

I just got around to completing the last missions in Cochinay and returning to that one important place. However

I have desperately wanted to get the US Marshal outfit recently; with this outfit I would have all 17 (16 without Rancher) for John. But because you can't change outfits

Luckily (*very* luckily) for me

**So.**

My saves will go a bit like this...

* Save #1 will be the precious one that I'm glad I still have -- the one before the last Agent Ross missions. That will be the one that'll still allow me to adventure and roam the countryside as John. I'll complete the US Marshal outfit prereqs on this one


* Save #2 will be John at the ranch


* and lastly Save #3 will be... Jack. There's a reason why I haven't finished this game in the year 2013. You guessed it -- I love playing as John. But I have to play as Jack for 100% completion

Never before have I had such a structured plan for a game's saves. But I think this game merits it

My idea for a sequel (its very general
Its couple years after the events in in Red Dead, maybe some people from McFarlane's ranch, and an older Bonnie would be involved too. Jack also has a lady friend (girlfriend, wife, whatever) who is iffy on the relationship and the ranch. 

The main conflict would be that the ranch needs money

Since this is in the future kind of

Jack also has an internal conflict because he realizes that he is heading down a similar road that his dad went down. His lady friend trys to tell him this throughout the game

I cant think of many people that can transfer over into the sequel, her father dies and she becomes the head of her ranch. She offers to help Jack with his ranch, in return he helps her with her ranch. There can a scene where she is shot and its all epic and emotional where she tells Jack that he is just like his dad.

---  
  
I currently have my game paused during my first mission playing as Jack Marston (John's son) and I'm riding with his mother back to their farm where John has just been killed.  
  
At this point
  
The reason I decided to pause the game and make a post on reddit is because I need to know something before it auto-saves and it's too late: Should I reload my game and sell all my items before redoing this mission
  
Also: As soon as the cut-scene ends where John opens the barn doors to face all the officers and bounty-hunters outside, I only managed to mark one guy. However, I'm sure if I redid this mission I'd be able to mark at least a considerable amount -- if not all of them. I'm just wondering if anyone knows whether this is possible or if there are any other details surrounding this scene?  
  
**TL;DR**  
1. When John dies
2. In the very last scene just before John is shot dead
  
---
 
Just to throw my two cents in; I'm disappointed with the direction the story is going now. I'll be honest and admit that I already knew that John dies at some point
  
[This article](http://reflectiongamer.wordpress.com/2010/06/06/red-dead-redemptions-ending-was-a-joke/) sums up my sentiments to a tee. It refers to the sense of accomplishment felt once you finally kill Dutch and the cool music that plays (albeit extremely brief in my case, but still, it's all a bit pointless when a few missions later your whole life gets fucked up. I was actually expecting something similar to *San Andreas* where even after the story is complete, you must work to maintain control of your hood -- i.e. you would be alerted to rustlers and would have to protect your herd. This would make even more sense playing as Jack, as John even had a conversation with him about growing up and maintaining *'the best ranch in the whole of West Elizabeth'*. Instead, you just commit suicide and lose everything only to embark on another revenge mission (so I gather).  
  
Of course
  
Whatever happens, R\*'s multiplayer could be to blame. Then again, I **still** have the multiplayer waiting for me to get stuck into once I've completed the single player. Hopefully it will be a refreshing experience after putting up with the state of *Modern Warfare 2* over recent months.",,False,self,t5_2rn7o,,http://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/fbn4j/i_have_a_question_but_it_involves_spoilers/

Unfortunately my new game is freezing **constantly** if I was to start a new game I would only be able to get up to ""New friends

If I load my ""old"" save games with a 100% story completion it will freeze after a few minutes of gameplay in much the same fashion.

2.  Update the game via xbox live (still freezes)
3.  delete the Xbox 360 HDD cashe and play the orginal version (still freezes)
4.  Reinstall updates (still freezes)

Now I did check online and on Rockstars page they say to contact Xbox 360 customer support (oh joy of joys) They basically told me to do the above steps

Is it possible for the Disc itself to be faulty?  Will going back to the store and swapping over the disc fix my problem? Xbox wants 180 dollars from me for a out of warranty service with no guarantee they can fix a problem for one game.

Is it wrong to love a family of ghosts

Make ur own character and chose to be on the north or south side in the civil war (along with better characters and features). Also if rockstar is able to make it like skyrim u should be able to hav a family but no nude scenery.

If rockstar cant make it like skyrim i think they should make a better story (dont get me wrong rdr's story was GREAT) and they should incllude a much bigger map amd more terrotories. I also think that the story should go along with rdr or just completely different.

An other theory is to set the time around the 1840s when mexico and the US were fighting for Texas. There should be slaves that u can choose to raise or free from plantations (slaves would be white and black). 

But in every. Theory u should be able to: hang ppl, boating, maybe swimming, train robbing, real store &amp; bank robbing like stealing from the cash register, get jobs like a sheriff-miner-ect., if u get in a fist fight u SHOULD DEFFINITLY BE ABLE TO KNOCK SUMONE OUT LONG ENOUGH SO THRE CAN ACTUALLY BE A WINNER (and if u get sumone knocked out u should be able to keep pounding their face so tey can possibly die), NO sexual interaction (becuz that can ruin the chance of a kid or teen with stricter parents not to be able to get this game

I had fun through the beginning through Mexico. Now I'm towards the end and Dutch is dead and I'm finally reunited with my family.
The end parts of the game honestly evoke an emotional response from me because of the relationship I never really had with my dad. Don't get me wrong he was physically there and was emotionally there when he had to. He decided to cheat on my mom and decided that his new family with my ""stepmom"" was far more important, Jack is so excited to see his father who hasn't been there. John finally gets to be with his family, gets to show Jack how to hunt and herd cattle and such other things. But knowing what is to come is really fucking saddening and infuriating to me.
John and his family are finally together for only about 3 damn days and what happens? John gets fucking murdered by those lying, right? I mean, John has decimated waves of outlaws and Mexican army members by himself so this should be the end of it and John can go back to his family. HELL NO! John makes sure Abigail and Jack get out safely and he is faced by at least 20 more men with guns. Okay, this should be the part where you just take a stick of dynamite and blow these bastards to smithereens. Nope, you get to take out 1-3 of them with a pistol, instead. Jack and Abigail go back to see John had been shot about umpteen times and he's just gone in a pool of blood.

I then noticed they were all running away and on the minimap the lack of colour in the players 'dots' - only 2: white (us) and blue? I checked the map and saw the other 8 guys had gotten sick of us harassing them and formed a posse of their own! - All 8 of them were tightly packed in a nearby settlement 1 minute from Armadillo - it's like they were planning something.

It's like Niko Bellic fucking off back to Russia/Serbia/Balkan/whatever and leaving you to play as Roman or Kate (depending on how you chose to deal with a certain in game mission ending).

I liked John! He was the perfect, SUCKS. I understand John was a killer but the whole Redemption thing in the title would allude one to assume he was turned around for the better and would therefore be allowed to live in peace. No does he shite. And the Honour system, what's the point in having it at all and maxing it out either way if there's no endgame effect? 

Honestly, you can guarantee you'd be dying at the end as you had committed more crime and the likes. Whereas doing all the honourable shit like hog tying thieves instead of killing them and rescuing the Working Girls from being murdered etc is rendered redundant at the end as it means nothing ultimately. 

I honestly love this game and really really enjoyed playing through it and experiencing that savage world. But killing John off without so much as giving us any sort of power to change it, fuck I may as well have been playing a Flashback game and he was dead all along, that would of suited better and would have EASILY been explained via creative direction of plot and timeline narration.

(Though it was incredibly satisfying to kill Ross and his family. I semi-auto shotgunned his wife on the porch and same for his brother both pretty much point blank...felt good to get justice granted but that wasn't enough to make me like Jack as much as his flea bitten scarred mother fucking bad ass of a dad).

I recently remembered how awesome the game is

I tried deleting the game data and reinstalling

I then completely restored the PS3, and all my savegames except for the three which I absolutely couldn't lose, and copied to my flash drive.

After setting everything up again, it said there was a problem with my game data and had to reinstall. Not a great start.

Then it refused to get past the loading screen.

So I restored again, or restore the gamesaves from my flash drive.

The game still refused to move past the loading screen. It's now running on a system which should operationally be 100% identical to one which is new from the box

This means that Rockstar has done such a shitty job at maintaining the game that it's not even compatible with the latest version of the PS3 firmware.
