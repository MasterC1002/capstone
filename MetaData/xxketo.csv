Totally pregnant.

In between happy dancing and calling our very close inner circle, and got the phone go-ahead from my pending doctor to keep on low carbing.


So there you go! I'm stupidly happy to be joining the ranks of the pregnant-ladies-of-keto.

Update (sad)
I'm sorry to tell you folks, this did help us as a couple really determine some of our life goals and we figured out that we really want to have kids, so as soon as the doctor signs off and we can stop being so super sad, we are going to officially start trying for babies again.

After two decades of trying to lose weight, at least online. Exact numbers vary according to personal experience, and I have no hard data, but in my research on the matter (i.e. hours spent searching and bookmarking specific keto concerns), I've discovered that many of the answers I'd found are only relevant to most men, i.e. simply untrue for most women.

Medical studies often ignore how drugs can affect women differently; similar issues can be found with exercise studies. The phenomena below have yet to be studied

Again

5) Keto seems to trigger early periods.

Not only does the infamous ""Atkins flu"" cause PMS-like symptoms (irritability, weakness, fatigue, and so on), but induction into low-carbing seems to cause shorter menstrual cycles in some women. This doubling of symptoms can make starting a low-carb diet very difficult for some women. Furthermore, water retention during menstruation can create the illusion that a woman has gained rather than lost weight by low-carbing, which can be highly disappointing.

4) Any and all bodily fluids can change.

Keto forums are rife with posts about how urine and saliva change in odor, low-carbing can have quite an effect on them.

3) Women's weights can fluctuate far more than many men's.

Period-related water retention aside, leading to great dismay at the scale. This is true regardless of keto, but is especially relevant to keto because so many men post their dramatic results online.

2) Weight loss isn't nearly as rapid for most women as it is for most men.

""I lost a zillion pounds in just 3 days!"" declare all the dudebros on keto forums. Unfortunately

1) Many women can't eat as much as they want and still lose weight by low-carbing.

There is controversy over this in keto-land (no one seems to be able to agree whether or not calories as well as carbs count) but for many women

Let me start this way. I'm a 23 y/o female, because this is not why I'm here. I'm here because of the horrible, terrible, nice people. The people who wouldn't let me admit I was fat. Am fat.

There is a lot of controversy out there about body shaming. The ladies over in /r/twoxchromosomes are one of the first to berate someone for calling another a name that implies that they should be ashamed of their looks (although this has spread to most of Reddit and many other places on the internet). This is wonderful. People should feel free to feel comfortable as who they are. That is

Typical conversation: 

ME: ""Honey

FIANCE: ""No

*Sexy times commence*

Awesome, 195, 200. Breathing heavily and not being flexible clued me in that there might be a problem. So I start dieting. Counting calories. 1200 cal/day and I'm always hungry. I wake up hungry, I go to sleep hungry. I eat the last bite on every plate and I'm still hungry. I'm so miserable I sink into a depression and start to lose my sense of what I am good at because all I can focus on is what I'm not good at. 

ME: ""Mom

MOM: ""Oh honey

220

DR: ""You need to lose some weight. Your weight is why you feel terrible all the time and have headaches 4+ times a week and all of your joints hurt.""

ME: ""I know. I've been eating a 1200 cal/day diet for a year and a half

DR: ""You need to exersice more and eat less. That's the only way to lose weight. Diet and Exercise.""

Wedding Day! WOOT! Pictures! Uhhh... Yay? 

I post to Reddit a comparison picture of my Husband and myself in high school versus now. I'm so happy!

ME: Took this guy out of the friendzone and its the best decision I ever made (insert picture of me &amp; husband in wedding dress). 

REDDIT1: What happened!?! You both got so fat!

REDDIT2: How dare you call her fat! Just because she is bigger than most women doesn't mean that she's fat! As long as she's happy with her body she's beautiful!

But I wasn't.  I was miserable.  But between a full time job, etc I found myself too exhausted to give a damn anymore.  Besides if people kept insisting I wasn't fat then I wasn't.  

It took me breaking chairs and not being able to reach my feet to tie my own shoelaces for me to admit that I had a problem. I started looking into diets that people had lost massive amounts of weight on and had kept off the weight. I found keto.  I found a supportive group of people here on Reddit who knew how I was feeling and what I was going through.  People who let me say I'm fat, until now, been allowed to look in the mirror and say ""I'm fat"" and still feel good about myself because I can follow that with ""But I'm not as fat as I was yesterday, and I won't be this fat tomorrow. ""  

I'm finally doing something about it because I stopped listening to nice people.  The really nice people who ruined my self image.  I'm not saying that body shaming is good and that the people fighting it are wrong.  Not at all! I feel that there is a perfect size for everyone and its not always the same.  But the thing that's most important is that the person in that body is happy.  I think that the people getting on to people for expressing discomfort and distaste for their bodies is what needs to stop.  I'm allowed to dislike myself just as much as I'm allowed to love myself.  What's important is that I'm happy

Just sharing it with you girls (and boy lurkers

I've lost 54lbs from March 2012 to today. When I decided to do keto and bought a scale, when I weighed 242. It blew my mind that I somehow gained 32lbs over a winter. It still does. Scared me that if I did that again, I could hit 300 without even thinking about it. Immediately I felt very behind. After losing my first 30lbs I felt like that was the weight I *should* have started at, the number I'd been carrying around in my head as the weight I *thought* I was.

I love keto and it's definitely been a journey so far. I was very excited to start

In the beginning I was impatient. I saw good results immediately and would do projection math (so if I lose 15lbs a month I'll be done in 8 months!) but ladies, ""*I don't have a deadline.*""

I was also a little taken aback by my results. I've lost 50 lbs, just *smaller*. The progress pics help me to see that I'm losing a little bit from all over. My belly, hips, thighs, arms, you can even see it in my wrists and knees. Sometimes I feel like the difference isn't dramatic enough. But then I remember the paper towel analogy I read on /r/keto. If you have a brand new roll of paper towels, and take off, 10 strips, and remember I was carrying those around all the time on my body!! (nearly. Two cinder blocks is 60lbs and I'm not quite there

So I still don't know what sort of shape I will be when I lose 50 more pounds, dat gap, no more ""baby arm"" (I get a crease in my bicep area when I lift my arm, like a chubby baby), no ""hip-cups"" (You can see how I can cup my hand around the pocket of fat on my hips), and no cankles. I think I might have achieved ankles now, but honestly I'm not even sure what ankles are supposed to look like

Did Keto in March/April.  Lost 25lbs damn quick (keto + running = speed).  Mid-April, I got my life together.  I lost the weight, ate healthily, and just felt much, much better. 

So when I got back to NYC

Keto taught me moderation

Then....complacency. A pint of ice cream a night snuck back up.  Shark week kept me from running one week

So I have felt HUGE for the last couple weeks.  Giant.  Monstrous.  I kept telling myself its time for keto again.  I was angry every Monday that came and went without me committing. 

So, if you don't like what you see then no excuses for keto"". Went out and bought one...hopped on, and.....

Holy god.  I'm 5lbs lighter than I was when I got off keto.  AND its shark week.

I am amazed at what keto has done to help me address this. It was hard eating enough fatty foods in the beginning--in general, and what I did eat was often junk food. But giving it a real try, I did eventually see that I could eat healthy, substantial meals every day and not gain weight from it. I could maintain, or lose weight, but even for all of the eggs, cheese and bacon I was eating

Eating disorders often come with at least a small amount of body dysmorphia, something quite a bit more overweight than I actually was. This was difficult for me to accept, but even at my lowest weight (105lbs), I strongly believed that I saw chub and flab in places it definitely didn't exist in. 

Eating regular, for me--that I would get close to my goal weight, be dissatisfied with myself as I always am and go for thinner and more waif-y. But this change has been more than losing 15 lbs.

Today I realized that I'm able to look into a mirror and, and what's more, feel content with it. I'm not stick thin, but I don't see a gut that isn't there, or cartoonishly thick thighs. I don't lie awake at night and feel kinesthetically like a beluga whale beached on my sheets. I also don't hear that little nagging, criticizing voice in the back of my head when I look in a mirror (you know, that voice that tells you how horrid you look and how you should crawl back into bed and not come out). It's a strangely quiet, and for the first time in my life, go lower. Honestly, whether I'm 105lbs and don't need it or 145 lbs and need to do it in a healthy way.

I know a lot of women cope with eating disorders, and maintain a healthy body weight (even lose a few pounds if you get a bit fluffy around the edges) has been a bit of a rescue for me :)

* Lost 30 pounds.
* Gone from a size 14 pants to a size ~~8~~ 6.
* Gone from a size 8 ring to a 6.5.
* Gone from a size XL t-shirt to a M (I can fit a small but I like my t-shirts loose).
* Gone from a size L/XL blouse to a S/M (depends on the cut).
* Started wearing shorts and tank tops again.
* Stopped having mood swings.
* Gained more energy than I have had in years.
* Changed my relationship with food.

I think the last one is the most important

When my husband suggested we start Keto I told him he was crazy. No way can you lose weight by eating all that fat. No way is this good for your heart. I was your typical skeptic. But I trust him so I read the Nutshell and the FAQ and agreed it was worth trying. And I'm happy I did! I have never felt better in my life.

2)	I visualize that carb food as a pile of sugar. I learnt this from my bro and it has helped me through morning meetings when there are platters of muffins, and bagels. I just picture piles and piles of white sugar on a plate. Suddenly, I forget the sweetness or texture and think ‘Ew, would you really put that into your body?’

I feel amazing. Doing IF/keto has reawakened genuine hunger cues. I don't remember a time in my life where I could go all day without eating and be able to say, I'm hungry! I love being in tune to that. It sounds so silly, but it's awesome to be able to not even give food a thought and just simply know when I'm ready to eat.

I feel amazing! It's only fifteen pounds but I feel like a totally new woman. Part of that was accepting the fact that currently I don't fit into the right clothes right before I started keto and going out and buying ones that fit properly. That means I get to see them getting looser and looser on me! I have so much energy and an increased sex drive and all together I feel amazing about myself.

I am a champion yo yo dieter. I am constantly gaining and losing the same twenty pounds. I have always done it by counting calories. My boyfriend remarks that I'm a complete bitch when I count calories the whole time I do it. I'm fat, and mean. He mentioned a few days ago that the change is more subtle in my body now but I am in a better mood, my hair looks better, my skin looks better and that he is happy with me choosing to lose weight this way!

I eat everything I want and never gain a pound!"" I don't know how I feel about my fib now; on the one hand it felt great seeing everyone looking green around the gills thinking my life is ""perfect"" (hahahaha what a laugh!) on the other hand I felt sort of bad, some of them needed to lose weight so badly. I do feel that if I told them about keto they'd think I was (a) insane or (b) going to drop dead of a heart attack at any moment so I stand by my decision to stay silent.

I've been doing keto for about two weeks, hovering around the 140-150 mark. In November of 2011 my heart stopped at a Denny's at 1:41 am. I had always had a fainting issue, but it finally escalated to something really scary. 

Thankfully they were able to bring me back, causing fainting spells) and a naturally occurring potassium deficiency (which helps triggers my fainting). They implanted a heart device on February 10th, and prescribed me a salt like tablet to help retain water. I gained a few pounds, as expected. Nothing I couldn't deal with. A few months later I was in a car accident, had knee surgery, and a tonsillectomy. These were within 2 weeks of each other, and kept me bedridden for awhile. I gained more weight, no big deal. I got on the Depo shot

It wasn't until this December that I realized that I had gained 25 pounds this past year. Yes, a few more months of rehab from my knee pushed back the original date by a bit), but my eating habits to deal with the stresses in my life, being the only real thing I had control over, is largely to blame to.

I saw pictures of myself from Christmas dinner and I was floored. I couldn't believe how bad I looked. I vowed to find a healthier life style, her progress was amazing!

When I cheat, girl, please. Nice try. I did it with soda, pasta, candy, anything really... It took me a couple weeks into this to really actually hold myself accountable. Every shit thing I ate I put on MFP and I wrote a diary entry reminding myself how NOT worth it that stuff is. It's not worth it in terms of my wanting to lose weight and look better, and it's especially not worth it knowing that processed sugary foods really mess your body up in the long run.

I totally caved last night and got a delicious dark beer. Mmm. It knocked me out of ketosis, but beer is my kryptonite. It DOES taste good! It makes me feel good! Now when I go out and want a drink, I have to make sure I go somewhere with a full bar so I can order up a scotch instead of a beer. 

It's really hard not to eat fried and carb heavy food because that is my comfort food. Fortunately for my Italian-raised, but I had a really unhealthy relationship with comfort foods and I need to become in control of my emotions when it comes to food. I don't earn a fried platter of deliciousness by just ""having a bad day"". No ma'am. What I earn from a bad day is a trip to the gym, or a long soak in the bath, or to fuck off playing Sims3 for an hour instead of doing laundry. I will eat Dat Pasta when my body is healthier and having a carb heavy meal doesn't trigger addictive eating habits. 

So, I will have a little of it, but not before weighing it against my goals and telling myself I can't be upset if I eat a one bite brownie and I don't see a loss in the next week. 

I had a beer and a bite of bread and I still had a loss.. does this mean beer and bread is on the table again? Hell to the no. My next weigh in is a week from right now and I am challenging myself to reach ketosis and stay there until at least then.

Those kelp noodles that are all the rage on the paleo blogs right now? $6.49 at Whole Foods. They are $2.49-2.99 (different brands) at my international market. They also carry several kinds of shirataki yam noodles

Coconut milk and cream. Canned or dried. Or whole young coconuts. I even found coconut ""powder"" the other day which appears to be what we would call coconut flour. Lots of other non-wheat alternative flours like yam

Those Eden organic black soy beans that are $22 for a dozen cans on Amazon? I got a pound and a half of dried beans for $2.49

The produce...every kind you can imagine and often cheaper. Also

A couple caveats. I have more luck in the Asian and Indian aisles. No luck in the Hispanic aisles yet - they're pretty carbacious. Asian aisle has more organic items available. Indian aisle is sometimes cheaper than a similar product in the Asian aisles. Nutritional info is sometimes iffy

First off

The calorie count on the label for the two brands I checked show you the calories you would be eating *without the  excess grease*.

You can tell by looking at the net weight on the front and comparing it to the back label. For example, it'll say the serving size is 15g and there are approx. 10 servings in the container. 

So multiplying 15x10

I understand you get water loss from cooking

So, if you use the grease from your bacon to cook other things instead of throwing it away or *don't* like to cook your bacon to a burnt crisp, then enter your bacon as 'raw' bacon in your calorie counter.",,False,,t5_2u80h,,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/14ra07/i_dont_think_the_guys_would_care_but_i_found/

* 1 stick (1/2 cup) unsalted butter
* 2 oz unsweetened chocolate (I used Baker's)
* 2/3 cup Truvia
* 2 eggs
* 1/2 tsp vanilla (optional)
* 1/2 cup almond flour

Optional (but highly recommended)

* heavy whipping cream
* cocoa powder

1. Preheat oven to 350F.
2. Microwave chocolate and butter in 30sec bursts until butter is melted. Stir chocolate; it should be hot enough to melt completely. If not
3. Stir in Truvia until smooth. Wait for it to cool a bit, it's not important to note that you shouldn't overstir. :P I added three fingerfuls of ground flaxseed, but you could easily skip that.
4. Scoop into greased mini muffin pan. Bake at 350 for 10-15min, works either way).
5. Whip the whipping cream until stiff, else the cream will deflate.)
6. Eat

Making 24 mini muffins gives a nutritional breakdown of 55cal, 0.9g protein per. Adding 1/2cup whipping cream and 1tbsp cocoa powder makes 62cal, 6.4g fat, 1.1g carb, 1.1g protein.

I found the Truvia had an aftertaste if I ate the brownie plain, or cayenne pepper, or coconut flakes to this recipe, all with good success.

I would work my butt off in the gym and eat as healthy as possible for months. I would never see a difference in my body or the scale. My clothes would fit the same

I started SS a few months ago and saw a dramatic improvement in my butt area but nowhere else. I was eating a lot of food, and before I needed to buy new pants I decided to start down a new path. When I took a hard look at my body, I was upset. I wanted to look really good this spring and instead I felt like I let myself down (besides doing great with weight lifting). After not focusing on how I looked for so long, reality struck me and I thought ""ENOUGH!""

So two weeks ago I started keto. I looked at the graphs to see how much/how fast I could lose. I scoffed at them. No way was that going to happen with this body. This body that takes months to shed a single pound despite any effort. But I gave it a try. 

My boyfriend has been my biggest supporter, two weeks has entitled me to 5 lbs lost. I said it. There it is. In two weeks I have lost more weight than I did with 6 months of hard work in previous years. 122 to 117. Holy mother of god. And what did the calipers say? 27% to 25.5%. I felt so good, I didn't care that my dance in the bathroom ended with a stubbed toe and a terrified cat.

I know I don't have weight to really lose. I'm considered to be in a healthy range. But being skinny fat has driven me a little crazy. I want my body to reflect the life I lead, I now feel like I could post some of my own soon. And for me, being able to say I actually have made progress, that's an awesome day. Because never, in my whole life, have I made so much progress, felt so good (and not hungry!) in such a short period of time.

She was so surprised that it was actually better for her and said she would love eating that. She's really excited to feel like it's ok to eat some red meat again too.

I've been wanted to share for a while and figured that now was appropriate since I'm getting back on the wagon after the holidays proved too difficult for my weak willpower.

**Warnings:** 

1. Possible trigger: Eating disorders
2. The following is essentially my life story. If you're not into that here is a good place to stop.

Like all women, and unworthy. Around the age of 11 the physical self hate started. I liked absolutely nothing about myself. I went through the usual ""fix it with pills"" phase, but the pain never stopped.

Inevitably, otherwise known as anorexia and bulimia. 

I was no TV example; I was not sickly thin or obviously sick. However, don't eat that,"" ""you've eaten too much, throw up or you'll never be good enough."" Every second of every day. While I never became model thin, I shaved off 30 lbs in a couple months due to starvation and purging what I did eat. 

This habit stayed with me after that initial weight loss, and despite my fiancé's clear distress over my issues. Then my man and I decided to give keto a try,

For the first time in 12 years the hate stopped. My view on food, and for the first time *ever* I looked in the mirror and thought ""hey, I'm not that bad!""

I haven't been very consistent with keto, christmas, celebrations.... oh my!) but it has changed my life. My weight may not have made the amazing changes that others see, but my mental state is better than it has ever been. I don't hate myself anymore.

So, your victories, accomplishments, and even the slip-ups. We're all human and I am no exception; you've helped me see this. Heck, at one point I even thought to myself ""I don't need keto, I'm not fat!"" Maybe I don't *need* keto for the weight, but considering how much it has changed my life there's no way I'm saying goodbye so soon!

1373553415.0,1i2yek,Motivation Tip,CymbalismofLife,34,5,16,"Losing weight is great motivation towards wanting to eat better and stick to the diet.  But I know

Motivation and, needs to be multi-faceted.  Eating well to lose weight is great, but weight loss is long term, and we can all ""justify"" eating those things we shouldn't because we aren't going to gain weight right then and there.  Find other reasons NOT to eat certain foods.  Things that are more immediate.  Other ways to distract yourself from the pull of the cupcake.

For me, and keep chemicals out of my body.  I buy and eat organic foods to increase their supply to others that still claim organic foods are not worth the (minimal) extra money.  I don't eat sugar because even though just one cupcake won't kill me, once I eat one cupcake, I'm eating cake, ice cream, cookies, and muffins for a week

That snack table at the party changes from something that might put me over my calorie limit (but not if I only eat a few), to a week of bad decisions, to breaking me from my desire to eat a Paleo diet for the rest of my life, to dropping my promise to society that I won't perpetuate the demand of processed foods.

 Anyways, she insists that she cooks this time. I mentioned to her that I was on a super low carb diet (and aslo added that it's surprising how many things have carbs so she might understand it's not just a matter of not making me pasta) so I might come off as picky, but she insisted it would be okay. I've made a few deserts that I'm quite pleased with so I offered to bring desert, because really how many non ketoers are familiar with super low carb/sugar baking. She responded saying she basically eats low carb anyways and we can just have some fresh fruit for desert. Fruit, while considered healthy by most, is super  carby and I havn't started incorporating it yet.

Thing is, but for the majority, who don't have petite frames, and especially those that have 60+ lbs to lose, it's unattainable. Why set yourself up for failure? 

I would hate to see someone here lose 50, and understand that not everyone can be a size 4. Find YOUR healthy size. You can alway adjust your goal lower if you hit it and have more to lose.

Things we did right: stuck to steamed or broiled seafood (NOM NOM NOM coast foods). Grilled chicken tenders

Things we could have done better?
Water. Definitely did not have enough water this weekend. We also ended up with a meaty meal with gravy (which was an accident. It wasn't specified in the menu). Also, after a couple of drinks, I found myself snacking on about six strawberries, five slices of kiwi and a handful or two of grapes.

No guilt. I'm shocked I nibbled on fruit instead of all the other delicious lookin' carby foods on that table.

I have an ice cream maker but I know there is a bag method you can use although I have never tried it.  It's very easy to make.  I need to watch calories unfortunately so the way I make it is: 

Recipe #1 

1 cup whipping/heavy cream 
2 or 3 cups unsweetened almond milk 
about 1/4 cup equal sucralose
vanilla 

I mix it all up and put it in my ice cream maker.  I don't know if it's the sweetener or the almond milk but it freezes really really hard.  I portion it out and freeze it in individual containers and then just put it in the microwave on defrost for a little bit when I want some.  I noticed it sticks to the side a lot because of how hard it freezes so you lose a bit.  Last time I put in under and ounce of vodka and it solved that problem.  (also didn't freeze as hard in my containers)  

The second one I made is egg based.  I just used this recipe http://allrecipes.com/recipe/ice-cream-base/ but I swapped out sugar for equal sucralose and did almond milk for the half and half.  This one has a pudding like consistency and probably doesn't even need an ice cream maker.  You could put it in containers and straight to the freezer I think.  Last time I added cocoa and made chocolate.  It was awesome!  

The possibilities are endless.  I have added mint extract and grated in dark chocolate for mint chip.  I often make vanilla and then chop up a little bit of salted peanuts and dark chocolate for ""drumstick"" ice cream.  Also I just mix in a little natural peanut butter sometimes.  It's really good.  My next experiment is going to be mixing in a cut up sugar free popsicle and making creamsicle ice cream.  You can do anything.  I am thinking of getting a little cream cheese in there then sprinkling a little of the almond meal crust I use to make cheesecake on top to make cheesecake ice cream.  

This is what I love about this lifestyle.  You can find a good substitute for most things you want!

Then I got extremely stressed out with graduate school and just regular life shittiness.

I justified it because I was going to a conference in two weeks and it was going to be hard to stay keto there, I just said I would take some time off rather than a few individual cheat days. I would come back to it, I mean, I was doing so great for so long. I had no sugar cravings, I was happy, I felt healthy, of course I'd start up again after the holidays. No problem.

Yeah right. I came back from the holidays more stressed out than ever. I was way more emotional and couldn't handle the stress of graduate school. I just found out my ex-boyfriend (who I'm still painfully in love with) is getting married this fall

But then I had an epiphany last week -- it was because of keto. I was way more focused and could study without being distracted every five minutes.

I have an addiction to food. I've had an issue with binges and overeating for the last 4 years at least. Hiding my eating habits from others- I remember when I came up with some dumb reason to go to walgreens so that I could take a moment in the parking lot to wolf down a taco bell burrito. It probably reaches further back than that- I remember being a tween and coping with my mom's hospitalization by eating a pound of muenster cheese with my sister. 

I have been overweight for a very long time. It has been an issue in my relationship and in my own self-perception for even longer. When I would try to diet

Keto has brought sanity back to my meals. It brings me back to those points when I was a kid, instead of slavishly waiting in anticipation.

This diet, especially in the early stages.  You have to become good at listening to your own body, reading labels and taking responsibility for what you put it it.

Not only has he been bringing boxes of sugary cereal in the house (fine, sugar, bread, more sugar, bread, pasta....etc.

There is plenty of food in the house he just doesn't want to eat it.  And also, when i go to the store, buy him his loaf of bread, and myself some flaxseed low-carb wraps, he'll eat my damn wraps and his fucking bread! wtf?! He's even compained to me, ""those wraps taste like cardboard"" then why the f****  are you eating them?! 

Now it turns out he 'wants help getting on this diet of mine' So last night i sat him down and explained it to him. Explained he'd have to look at labels, etc.  He lost interest about 2 minutes into the conversation and walked away.  This morning I woke up and half the damn cottage chese (3 servings worth!) was gone. He'd eaten it for breakfast.

I'm angry, and feel he is undermining my lifestyle choice but wants me to lose his weight for him.  He  wants me to hold his hand through a diet, well i'm sorry, i'm not going to.

Am i being a 'diet snob'? I kind of feel like i may be.  But I've had it.  I've struggled through this diet trying to change my self

For about 5.5 years I suffered from Bulimia (this June will be 3 years recovered) but I still have the body image issues and the whole shebang that goes along with it. With that being said

My jeans dont fit. Alright, and its impossible to find anything that fits. So, I went jean shopping...nothing fit, of course. However, I loved watching myself take off those ill fitting jeans every time. I looked better without them on than when I put them on. For the first time in my life, I think I look good naked/partially naked. I am confident. I am strong, I am beautiful. I....I feel amazing. I feel unstoppable.

Woke up this morning, but it's my first major health goal that I've successfully reached.

To top it off

I'm now well past the joy of ""oh,"" and to the happy annoyance of ""shit, NONE of my clothes remotely fit anymore!"" Not complaining, though these wardrobe changes are going to get expensive...

As for my personal plan, day-to-day walking. After losing over 20 lbs, I reevaluated my numbers and switched to a 70/25/5 ratio. Personally, the extra fat seems to work better for me so far to keep hunger at bay. I get the extra fat by having coconut oil &amp; heavy cream coffee with cinnamon &amp; chile powder almost every morning and by putting homemade cheese sauces on hearty veggies (like Brussels sprouts and broccoli) as a side dish.

One of my favorite, when almost done cooking, add a couple handfuls of spinach or kale. Stir occasionally, salt &amp; pepper to taste and done! It also helps that I already loved bacon, fat, gristle and such on meat, so the fat part of the diet is easy for me.

When it's not feeling easy (PMS, etc.), those Emerald brand cocoa almonds are amazing (within limits). Also, raspberries were already my favorite berry, besides being relatively high-fiber for a fruit, so that always cheers me up as well. And I adore dark chocolate too, the darker the better

It hasn’t always been easy and I haven’t always been good. I refused to calorie count Christmas, I do my best to reassure myself that it was a one-time thing and (the real key) not beat myself up too much about it. It does pull me out of keto, and I feel so blah, that’s enough of a punishment for me without the additional mental torture. I trust that if I just get back on track, everything will start working again. And, it does.

Sticking to it 99% of the time over the past 6 months has absolutely paid off, or exercising like a linebacker. Keto may not be for everyone, but it seems to be for me, and I’m pretty happy about that.

Next up, I don’t ever want to go back to eating how I used to, but once my weight is where I want it to be I’ll probably have to drink beer again occasionally to keep from getting too skinny :)

Essentially after two months on keto my weight loss graph [looked like this](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#5).

The advice I was given was to **drink more water**. So this I did. 

[This is my log](http://media.tumblr.com/82179fde73690c54400727d3d96cf867/tumblr_inline_mlpljxQHwb1qz4rgp.png) of my attempt to quit my stall by drinking at *least* 3 litres of water - with the added requirement that I drink half a litre of water for each cup of coffee because it’s a diuretic.

**note**: *I wasn't very good in the beginning

So *did it work?*

Well I choose to show you this in the form of a graph… because me. 

So the top line is water intake (in litres) for that day

[This graph](http://media.tumblr.com/fa7d374f747ac8f8fce80bddf5110c23/tumblr_inline_mlplkzsnZT1qz4rgp.png)

And body fat DOES follow. Water intake goes down, body fat % loss goes up. It’s not actually that clear on the above graph - but it’s clearer if I plot the bodyfat % loss a day behind...

I've been on keto for about 90 days total. For 60 of those days, and I started playing this little game where I tried to make my deficit as big as possible. When I started eating 700 calories or below just to ""win,"" I decided to stop tracking. Now I'm eating when I'm hungry, keeping tabs on my calories and carbs mentally. I stopped weighing myself until yesterday, when I saw I'd lost another 4 lbs or so.  
  
The problem? I've lost only 12 lbs according to my bathroom scale. I visited the doctor today and learned that I had actually only lost 5. I came home and cried. I have been fat since I got my period at age 11. I have tried every fad diet, and because I need something that can be effective while my chronic pain is unmanageable and prevents me from exercising regularly. Now that even keto has not worked for me, I feel like I am going to be fat forever. I can hardly even look in the mirror without just seething with self-hatred.  
  
The other problem I've run into is that for about a month now, after the rest of my meal...it doesn't matter. I had my macros pretty well balanced, but now I am afraid to eat fiber or even take a supplement because I know I will be miserable afterwards. Sometimes I rush to the bathroom 4 or 5 times in an evening. Raw or cooked doesn't matter (raw is usually worse). Cauliflower and green beans are safer than anything else, but I have run into trouble with them too. Now I am miserable if I try to follow my macros, and I can't enjoy my food or going out to eat with my boyfriend without knowing the horrible discomfort that will follow.

I'm now at the lowest weight I can remember being (minus one time where I was deathly ill and on lost a bunch of weight over the course of a few days but put it all back on after I was able to eat again! SO doesn't count) as of this morning: 220. I'm about to get into a different set of numbers and I'm slightly overwhelmed at the awesomeness. My starting weight a few years back was 309. I'm now calling my current existence my starting weight, because who wants to be holed up in a few years ago?! I'm have endometriosis, and end up bedridden a few days a month with intermittent days of 7/10 pain in the meantime. My husband is also doing Keto with me, and as supportive and amazing as he is, I'm really looking forward to having a bunch of WOMEN to talk to! Woohoo!

**tl;dr version:**

So this marks the fifth completed week of living la vida keto. I’m an utterly changed human being, feeling positive and upbeat, experiencing an upsurge in energy and stamina that I have dreamed about my whole life, and enjoying the food I eat while never going hungry. 

This is my perfect life. Right here, and happiness. Whatever keto has done to my brain is nothing less than a miracle. I’m literally crying from joy while I type this. Words fail to convey how life-changing this is for me. 

But okay, but they *do* fit!), and this week I think I’ve lost even more as my size 18 pants are now getting to the “very very loose” stage. Not “drop off my butt” but close! Five weeks ago, I could barely button my size 18 pants (which have a little stretch to them, and I was miserable sitting down but I was damned if I was going to buy size 20 pants. Nope. So, you know, I just suffered instead. As you do).

What am I doing? Well, or getting on the scale. My (mild) ED issues were a factor in that decision, but also, I’ve always believed that healthy living is supposed to be simple and easy (outside of dealing with things like illnesses, cancer, etc. of course). I knew from experience that I was never, ever going to get healthy or lose weight on a regimen that required militant tracking. Some people do well at that, but I left that behind a long time ago. When I started keto

I’ve been in nutritional ketosis for nearly a full month (checked by ketostix and corroborating evidence such as metal mouth and oily urine EWWWW) . During that time I’ve had a couple of beers, so clearly I have a little leeway with the carb count. I start my mornings with a high-protein shake made with full-fat coconut milk, followed by bulletproof coffee. Lunch is always my biggest meal, usually some form of meat/veggies scramble or meatballs with cream sauce and/or avocado. I follow that with a fat bomb. Dinner is more like a snack of “some form of protein” with cheese. I might have a few nuts for “dessert” or another fat bomb. I’m trying to shove more dark greens in, usually via homemade creamed spinach a few nights a week. But really, I’m SO FULL all the time that “shoving more in” is quite the chore. {insert expression of amazement here}

All my portion sizes have shrunk

I have started “free form” dancing almost every night for at least 30 minutes; it’s my version of “play time” without structure or rules, because I was always *exhausted* when I came home from work. Now I’m looking for ways to burn energy! 

(I suspect the weekly updates from here on out are going to be pretty repetitive (and a lot shorter) but I’ll keep doing it anyway

I'm 19, which turned into bulimia over the summer. My first year of college, I tried to ""start fresh"" but the bulimia continued and was eventually tamped down to just binging again. 

So that brings us to May

Since then, then came my period today and so I just accidentally bounced the carb count up to 50 for tonight because I couldn't control myself to stop eating peanut butter.

Reading this all I think I see my fucking problem: obviously binging is my issue. But I feel like it isn't that simple. I've bounced between therapists since I was 13 (so about six years now) and none of them has been able to guide me anywhere near recovery - mostly just make me feel guilty or refuse to see my eating disorder as a real ""thing."" I don't really trust therapy as a way to help me. I think if I just learn to control myself I can heal

I thought keto could help, and I think it could help my depression and shitty broken metabolism that came with my eating issues.

I have about 30 pounds to lose

I implore you

TL;DR: I have disordered eating and I think keto might help if I could stop binging and I don't count calories. Is this plausible?

After stumbling on a recipe for Oopsie bread yesterday and finding out how easy it was to make it – only 3 ingredients, success! It’s delicious and tastes like angel food cake. It also tastes and has the exact texture of the sponge cakes you get at Chinese bakery stores! I’m inspired to bake them in muffin tins so then they will be even MORE like the sponge cake.  then I’m going to try to add cheese and jalapeños to it and make it a little bit more savoury. Mmmmmmmm. Lastly, I did the bf test and he couldn’t wrap his head around the fact that it taste so much like angel food cake but doesn’t have sugar or flour. WIN!

So to conclude, so good. Simple recipe here:

3 eggs
3-4 oz of cream cheese (I used half an 8 oz block)
1/8 tsp cream of tartar

-	separate egg whites and egg yolk
-	whip egg white with cream of tartar in a metal bowl until stiff. If it looks done
-	Whip egg yolk and cream cheese until smooth-ish. Mine was still a little lumpy to be honest.
-	Fold egg white into egg yolk. Gently.
-	Spoon onto parchment papered cookie sheet. I made 6.
-	Bake in preheated oven at 300 degrees and check after 20 minutes. Should be golden brown. 
-	Chill completely to set. 
-	EAT!

Last year

I gradually started introducing wheats/grains/starches back into my diet earlier this year and slowly gained all but 10 pounds of it back.

So, although I've noticed that my calories have been in the 1900 to 2000 range quite a bit. Lots of fats are contributing to that number for sure.

So, really slow. I looked back at what I was doing last year, how I ate etc (I was writing a blog and luckily wrote down everything I was eating daily for a few weeks.) I put all the info into MFP and noticed that even though my carbs were higher than they are now, my calories were lower.  Much lower, and I lost weight.

So

I was really into the idea of eating lots of fats, for sure. But, I think all those calories may be the problem, and I hate the idea of counting calories again, but I can't think of any other reason why my weight loss is so slow this time around. ;/

Here's how my day started:


* Breakfast: 2 sausage patties and coffee
* Lunch: taco salad (~300 cal with measured portions). 

I was still feeling peckish, but then I proceeded to eat ALL the rest of the whipped cream. I used 1/2 c. of heavy whipping cream, so that's a TON of calories - around 400 according to MFP. Ugh. Insta-regret. 

Later that afternoon, mustard powder, and S&amp;P. I ""tasted"" it to ensure that it was salted properly, but had a few too many bites. Probably 1.5 eggs worth. 


* Dinner: I hate the ENTIRE REST of the egg salad. All of it. Now I feel miserable. I wasn't even hungry to begin with.

I logged everything into MFP and ended up with a caloric intake of almost 2, 70g of protein, and 11g net carbs. This is all according to MFP, so I'm not 100% confident in the numbers.



I've been on keto with virtually no cheats since January, but just the fact that I binged at all is concerning to me.

So I'm five and a half weeks in now. A little backstory:

About four years ago, a weight at which I was totally embarrassed of my body. Somehow during my senior year, I began to drop weight as a result of being more active at a physical job and my hectic schedule. By my freshman year of college, I hovered between 130 and 135. I was thrilled, and for the first time in my life I was at a comfortable weight.

Well, but I tried to be aware of my weight and keep it under control. Then I met my fiance. 

We've been together for three and a half years now. It has wrecked havoc on both our waistlines. I started eating junk like he was eating

Fast-forward to this winter. Christmas 2012. I stepped on the scale and I about died. 150. No freaking way. Not happening. I had been looking in to keto for the past month or so, all the carbs in the house went in the trash, and I started my journey. That was five weeks ago.

I'm 5'5"". My weight is currently 138, but its hard for me to say. I see myself everyday. What do you think? Is it getting any better? I know that I still have a ways to go. I am not so interested in the number on the scale. It means less to me than how my body looks and how I feel. Which, incidentally, I feel so much better now that I have rid myself of the nasty carbs.

My weight loss hasn't been as rapid or substantial as some others' here, and now only have one hole left! The ""fat"" pants I started in (which were loose but comfy), I now have to fold the waist band over just to keep them up, and even so they're too loose to comfortably wear. The jeans that used to be too tight fresh out of the dryer now fit like a dream, and are even loose after being worn and stretched for a couple of hours (does anyone else experience this??). On my birthday last week my mom made the amazing lemon bundt cake she always makes, and I had part of one piece. It just didn't taste good to me. But perhaps my biggest NSV is that my obsession with the scale and the number it shows has dwindled significantly. At this point, a lower number is simply a bonus. 

I am down 10 lbs. as of today, but I have less than 15 lbs. to go before meeting my goal. Dare I say... I can do this!?

Beating my obsession with the scale came with frustration. My life is in a constant state of turmoil, and didn't give a rat's ass about what I put into my body. Since starting keto I've had a couple of mis-steps, a couple of nights that I allowed myself to have 2-3 beers. And I stalled my progress for those beers. It took a week and a half for me to get back on track (scale wise). But somewhere during that time, I realized that's the point that I would normally give up and I didn't. I trudged on and got right back to good habits. I realized this change is actually sticking for me, and the number on the scale hardly matters, as I know it will balance out in the end.

I'm starting day 3 this morning and I've hit 85% fat intake both days. I lost 5 pounds which is incredible since my goal is only 25.

So far my favorite part has been the bullet proof coffee - it gave me tons of energy yesterday and I wasn't even hungry when meal time rolled around.

I was afraid I would be grumpy and tired but I've found the opposite to be true. I even went for a brief run yesterday and took a yoga class. I ate 1400 cals instead of the recommended 1000 to make up for the activity.

If you're stuck in a plateau or are having trouble with sugar cravings like I did I'd highly recommend trying a fat fast for a few days.

this lead to some disordered eating in my late teens (anorexia) and then spent my twenties struggling with exercise bulemia and binge eating.  i also abused birth control and emergency controceptives and had always thought that was the major reason my period never came back when i stopped all that mess at 25.  

i started eating a cleaner diet, no soy(not that i ever ate much), but still struggled with binge eating and then wearing myself out exercising.  i put myself through gallstones and kidney stones with binging, going up and down in weight 40 pounds (im 5'4"" small frame i have weighed 100, i have weighted 150) burnt out my adrenals to the point my dr told me i had the hormone level of an 80 year old, had super bad depression, burnt myself out doing farm jobs etcetcetc...but i never realized that my binging on everything and super bad hypoglycemia and blood sugar issues could be due to being extremely carb sensitive.  it kind of makes sense because in my teens i was definitely an alcoholic and have that in my family(as well as eating disorders:(!) 


anyway finally, i had pretty much only been eating root veggies and winter squash for a few years in terms of carbs at this point but even that had become too much for my poor abused system and i would binge on carrots! seriously its possible! a few weeks after cutting carbs down to a good 50 g i am feeling like my blood sugar is super stable, although i am not super energetic.  and one afternoon after a HIIT class i start getting cramps like my bladder was going to fall out and then bang.....my period!!!!!!!!!! i was super excited because i really really want to have children, have always worried about my bones due to lack of hormones and just havent felt like a girl for a while. seriously i had only had two periods in five years before this!

i have to admit it was a pretty henious period, starting a new job, starting HIIT and yoga, a total recipe for burn out.  i was so happy when my period actually came, it definitely explained the bloating and i honored it and kept doing my best to keep low carb and continue exercising.  a little more then a month later, in time with the full moon, another period!!!!!! this one wasnt as bad as the last and now that its winding down i feel a bit more comfortable in my skin for the first time in a long time. i am way less bloated and can feel a difference in my yoga poses, much more space in the postures!

These last few days I've been eating VERY few calories, half a cup of brown rice for a meal or a few bites of my kids noodles for a meal and drink just tons of water. A handful of peanuts or just a diet coke.... I haven't been obsessive about what I eat or how much and when I'm not focusing EVERYTHING on what goes into my mouth, I don't obsess about food and the temptation just isn't there for the junk. 

I'll probably go back to very low carb soon, reckless urge to punish my body by gorging myself and sabotaging my efforts but days of fasting give me a lot of power that I just trip over. 

Also

Very much loose skin on and around my breasts and upper thighs have me looking like a purple and pearl zebra. There are even stretch marks from the back of my knees to my mid-calf and from my armpit to my elbow. Lovely. I want to be at my goal weight for a few months before I consult with a plastic surgeon. When I do I'll post pics of what my body looks like, ""Time will fix it, your skin just needs to catch up"" I laugh at my computer. Gaining a hundred and forty pounds in a year and having three kids back to back means my skin ain't catching up enough to matter. 

Anyway

I have run so much since I had my baby last August. I tore the meniscus in my knee last late fall/early winter but I still run on it anyway. I run my butt off then limp around for a few weeks, rinse, repeat. Losing over a hundred pounds... Freedom, man. 

I'm so so so so so so sick of butter, ranch, chicken and all that. I love salad, thank goodness that has limitless varieties. 

I'm not nervous about discussing keto anymore. I've been over the info so many times I think I come off as arrogant. It's really just boredom from having to present the material over and over and over to people who listen for five minutes then say

Umm, it's probably /r/ketocirclejerk. Laughs to be had there, but sorrowful ones, because its realistic humor. This sub isn't bad. 

I'd be willing to field questions. I hope that doesn't come off as hoity-toity. I want more to succeed and MOST of the usernames I saw constantly at the beginning of my keto trip are no longer around. I'm assuming most didn't make it bc they still reddit. 

Anyhoo I'm here, though. Liking that functional fitness. Liking getting checked out and catcalled occasionally. Liking being just as fit as my hubby. The man is military and has a schnazzy, high speed job so is fitter than most. Now we challenge each other instead of me just bitterly remembering how fit I used to be before depression and babies. 

Keto has been definitely a great tool. I recommend it. Hope you're all doing well and finding inspiration.

My keto buddy and I both set a goal to drop into the 130’s by the end of May. We were at 145 around that time and seemed like a possible feat. Especially so when I had a great 4-5 days where I was losing .8lb a day! But then I went into PISS, I was ketoing hard. I don’t cheat, I counted my carbs, net carbs were usually 15-18g a day. I drank my water, usually 12-16 cups a day. I drank stock now and there, not as regularly as I could but I got some salt intake in other places. I don’t drink caffeine. I had my macros at 70-80% fat, ~15-20% protein, one glass on May holiday and one at mother’s day. The only vice was I allowed myself dark dark chocolate

I was so happy my keto buddy reached her goal with a week to spare!!! I wanted to be on the same boat as her

- **introduced HIIT**, but got injured in my 3rd round so I stopped to heal a bit and just worked out lightly at the gym or by playing outside. I wanted to try Keto without exercise to see how far it would go.
- **IF for 3 days**. First day was hard

By the end of the 3rd day of IF

This process didn’t come without its challenges, IF and so many stories that kept me focused and not feeling alone. So I want to share with you my little success too and hopefully someone in a similar situation somewhere, sometime, would read it and feel like they aren’t alone either. :) Thanks for listening!

   I configured MFP to keto settings last night. Didn't know it was possible until then. According to the macro calculator on /r/keto as well as my own understanding of my body, 160 cm (5'2"" i think that is). So I set my calorie limit on MFP to 1200 a day, to get some kind of deficit. That's all well, I suppose. I haven't had any trouble keeping that limit. 
   
Up till now, I realized that 5 energy% of a 1200 kcal diet is only 15 g of carbs a day. (I usually land somewhere around 18-22 g a day). This is the first day with the new settings and I dread putting anything in my mouth because I'm afraid It'll put me over 15g right away. 
   
What should i do? I can't really up my calorie limit, but even when I do, I can't really eat more than I'm hungry for, right? Should I ignore the ""Maximum 5 energy% from carbs-limit"", and stick to 20g a day (which is roughly 7-8%)? Or should I omit even more dairy, nuts and leafy greens (my biggest carb sources) to get the macros right? Which is more important?
    
...Also, and count them instead? Is it Net carbs that is supposed to stay below 20(or in my case15 g) a day? If so, when looking at the Calorie breakdown in MFP, does the carb percentage in the pie chart reflect Total carbs or net carbs? Is the pie chart any help to me at all?

""**A Little Backstory (aka

Let’s look over my entire life thus far; bear with me, Patt, ex-boyfriends, ask anyone who’s known me long enough and they’ll tell you that despite my awesome brain, charming wit, and my wonderful personality, I’m disorganized, and downright lazy. (Hey, part of my problem before was that it was mentally overwhelming. I’d start thinking about cleaning and thinking of all the things I had to do, but if I want to do that I have to do this other thing first

So, it’s only January, but I’m not sure how many more understatements will beat this one.

I can’t believe how awesome I feel. I want to clean, I can take care of it right away and move onto the next thing. I can feel the fog lifting, I don’t ‘space out’ or get stuck in the middle of something like I used to. This is pretty huge for me, bigger than you know.

**So What Happened?**

Monday night is when I started to feel the change. I spent an hour or two scrubbing the shower and replacing the nasty plastic shelves I had set up in there, I swept, I mopped, scrubbed some more, but when it was over, I still wasn’t satisfied (but goddamn was I tired). Tonight, I spent another two hours cleaning and rearranging the bathroom; I cleared off and moved an antique wooden cabinet out to the kitchen, I got back behind the toilet and scrubbed the fuck out of everything, grabbed a pumice stone and some bleach

**So...**

In conclusion, I’m happy. I’m stronger than I’ve ever been in my entire life, I’m actually starting to see some muscle definition, I sleep through the night (which was a constant problem when I was eating shitty before), and I’m not hungry. I’m not fucking hungry.

Women are experienced dieters as as such we are conditioned to eat small meals pretty frequently and to treat calories as precious resources that need to be carefully doled out through the day. This doesn't work for keto! The benefit of keto is that it eliminates hunger

I routinely eat meals that are 700-900 calories. My daily routine is like this:

I just wanted to post here as an introduction

I'm on my second week of keto, but I upped my sodium and that made the headaches go away although I was still dealing with the lethargy and brain fog.

And I still am, that really seemed to help dial down the brain fog, so maybe that was due to not eating enough fat to start with (old habits die hard!).

So, nope I sure don't. Not calories, not carbs, not macros, not weight. Nope. For me, it's part of a big burrito of ED issues; I can't really ""moderate"" that kind of behavior, it turns unhealthy and destructive pretty quickly (I'm 43, my history with diets means I can eyeball things pretty damn accurately

I ""watch"" my carbs, illnesses...2012 was suckage). Other health issues made me take a hard look at keto and I think it might work for me long term in ways paleo didn't. I'm kind of doing the ""paleo-lite keto"", honestly, as it's a comfort zone. 

I use ketostix to gauge whether I'm in ketosis, I've been in ketosis since about the 5th (according to the ketostix) and have remained there (even despite one night out with the girls that included some wine!). Two weeks in, my clothes feel a smidge looser, but nothing drastic. 

What I HAVE noticed is an uptick in energy. I've started dancing when I get home every night, and I need all the energy I can get, so having enough to come home, crank the music and boogy out for 30 minutes is pretty damn astounding to me! *pumps fist*

I knew that my father in law is now on a diet, and her boyfriend also are on a diet, and doing low carb/slightly primal. So this means that 3 out of 4 people who eat regularly at the house are on a diet.)

Friday night's dinner. A Thai Curry.  Saw the recipe... Not horrible other than the fact that there was a tiny amount of sugar in it
I'm almost to the home stretch for the first day. But then

I could feel the sugar instantly hitting me. I went to bed feeling bloated and my tummy gurgling.

I don't remember if I woke up the next morning with keto mouth like I normally do or not.

Had a cup of tea with my usual cream in it. Found myself STARVING. I mean I was starving. Finally around Noon
I politely eat what is offered to me knowing that my dream about staying in keto over this weekend is officially gone.

A few hours later it's time for 'lunch.' I'm starving. I know that this is because of the carby food. What's for lunch? My absolute weakness. Crumpets. Seriously they are a weakness of mine. I was able to hold out until I smelled the first one toasting

Dinner a few hours later, I passed on the grilled tomato and instead had the grilled mushroom.

Today... I woke up and instantly knew I was no longer in keto. Made me sad. Had my cup of tea with cream resolving to get back in as quickly as possible. Eggs with Salmon for breakfast

And now

The reason I didn't do my own meals (I'm sure you were all wondering) was that they hadn't done the weekly shopping yet

At least tonight will be the sunday roast

Sigh. It's just that comment she always makes of 'Oh you can have just a little bit of ________!'

And on top of it.. I'm pretty sure that me falling off the keto wagon is the direct reason that I've been dreaming about cannibalism last night.

I woke up in a good mood, and yes, still had bad/grumpy days, but it wasn't over-arching for me. As soon as I started eating carbs again- BAM! Seriously like a day or two after. I'm more aware of it now, so I try to keep it under wraps, but gosh!

Another positive is I am now more certain Keto works. I work up hungry this morning. Legitimately hungry. I haven’t been hungry like this in the morning since I started Keto. Which means Keto is working with my body

* ~1/2 can of coconut milk (or a little less)
* ~10 ice cubes (or more

1369073290.0,1ephc1,So glad I found a community like xxketo,KeepingKalm,22,4,6,"Hello there! First post ever on Reddit and I just wanted to share my experiences.

Background: I've put my body through the wringer the last 6 years. Lost 20 lbs through calorie restriction and running (which i HATED) - got down to 190 lbs. Stayed that way for a year. Was in a 12 step program for Overeaters - which helped with some emotional food issues and made me face some demons.

Got engaged and decided to lose weight. Lost an unhealthy amount of weight in a short time (From 190 - 160 lbs in 2 months). Yo-yo'ed from 165 - 175 for a year until the wedding. Meanwhile mentally torturing myself about any weight gain (.2 pounds - OMG END OF THE WORLD). Crying if I gained more than 2 pounds. Compulsively weighing myself day and night. My entire mood was determined by the scale #. I was miserable - thinner and still miserable. When I lost weight - i was on top of the world

After the wedding - I was back at 185-190 within 6 months. I just enjoyed myself...just ate whatever I wanted in whatever quality I wanted.

Been this way for 2 years now. Losing 10 pounds then putting it back on. Losing 15 pounds then putting it back on. Losing inches while I lifted and then gaining them back when I stopped. I am the definition of yo-yo. I can't even count the number of times these cycles have happened.

It's been 3 weeks on keto and here has been my experience:

Starting weight: 190.

Day 1 - 5: lost 6 pounds (water weight)

Day 7-8: gained 4 pounds (my fault - there was bday cake)

Day 9 -10: lost 2.5 of the gained pounds

Day 10 - 17: consistently @ 185.6 lb
(Getting frustrated b/c I was eating around 1

Day 18 - ""Forced"" myself to eat 1

Day 19 - lost 2 pounds! Currently today at 183.4

It has been slow (3 week - 6.5 pounds) but I'm ok. I've done the fast route and it obviously didn't work so I've decided to go the slow and steady route.

Things I noticed: I don't need as much food as I always thought. I don't need as much sleep as I always thought. As I write this - I'm thinking the hunger and sleep was probably because of the carb/sugar/insulin crashes i was doing to myself...wow. what a revelation.

I'm a long-time lurker, I've felt inferior to others because of my weight. My best girl friends are all slender and lovely, and in every social situation, I feel like the 'fat friend'. This self-hate has carried over to both relationships and career: I've never felt good enough to pursue a relationship or believed that anyone could possibly be attracted to me because of my weight, and because I am training to be an opera singer, the importance of appearance is constantly stressed to me, leaving me feeling hopeless and inadequate when think about how big I am.

I'm currently studying abroad, and study. I have a great deal of time just for myself that I've never had before, and I am determined to use it well. 

I go back to the United States on August 1 and will graduate from college the following week. I want to take beautiful pictures with my family. I want to feel like myself when I walk across the stage

1358885276.0,172obw,Keto versus low(er) carb?,enilcycyxodk,21,5,38,"Hi ladies of xxketo

I'm about halfway into an effort to lose around 45 pounds, but have some questions (some lady-specific, others not). 

I've noticed through the natural course of counting calories that I have shifted towards eating fewer carbs, so I'm wondering what the extra benefits of keto are, versus someone who eats, say, 100-150 net carbs. My initial gut reaction to keto is that it makes intuitive sense to tell people to cut down or eliminate bread, rice, pasta, but it is weirder to me to say to heavily restrict fruit and some vegetables, but will likely lose the benefit of being in ketosis.

Some random observations:

1) Ketosis is famed for being amazing at burning fat. However, especially for ladies. It seems like there are wide varieties of results in both communities, and both communities have big successes as well as plenty of people having trouble. 

2) Some people say the benefit of keto is not having to count calories, counting calories is also usually recommended, and unlimited amounts of keto friendly food will probably make you gain weight. 

3) Even though you should probably count calories, in that case, it seems like a 100-150 net carb diet would be nearly as good, or even better(?). 

4) Keto is also famed for being delicious. But

So, and fewer drawbacks, with lower-carb plus calorie counting. The question then is ketosis itself, which is the only real difference between the two. 

From what I've seen, clearer brain, improved sleep.

The drawbacks of ketosis can be (for some people): heart palpitations/lightheadedness, keto brain fog, messed up periods, constipation, smelly vaginal secretions/urine/breath, diminished athletic performance, problems sleeping.

(Sidenote: I know that low carb/keto seems to be often recommended for women with PCOS, so am wondering about the situation for others.)

TLDR: Keto versus lower carb (100-150 net carbs). Has anyone tried both? What am I missing here in thinking that keto seems to be a lot of sacrifice for something that can be achieved with a somewhat less restrictive approach? I must be missing something

1368470584.0,1e9dhe,[SV][NSV] Best weekend yet! goal 1 almost there!,mons177,17,1,2,"Massive post. I feel so good right now

I have a routine on work days: I pack breakfast &amp; lunch, I log. On weekends, nooooottt so great. I'm a little less strict on logging, and since my bf and I will eat out at least 2-3 times with friends or just us, I don't know how many carbs are in the meals even if they are 'keto friendly'. Needless to say, I usually would feel less than proud of myself come Monday morning... **but not this Monday, baby!** 

I was SO GOOD. Let's realize that it wasn't just any other weekend but Mother's day weekend. I survived two family meals. **Here are some NSV:**

- logged every meal this weekend
- drank enough water to drown myself
- made over 2+ dozens of chocolate covered strawberries for the my mom and my bf's mom on Saturday AND Sunday = did not eat even one! Instead I ate one low carb cheesecake, spoons, and pretty much drinking the left over chocolate.
- brought an egg salad to dim sum because mom wanted dimsum and I know it's near IMPOSSIBLE to get low carb things there. No one cared that I'm eating my own food and everyone had a great time.
- watched bf's family eat the mountains of sweets they have at their house while we were playing games. Just said 'no thanks'. (ps. they are all in great shape! like muscular and cut for the guys
- made oopsie bread and packed it to dinner
- I'm usually a 2 glass of red kinda gal at dinners
- chose steak twice while out for dinner. Sunday night's was an 18oz t-bone rib eye steak. the waiter was looking at me like 'are you for real?!'. keto = luxury. Left over will be my dinner today and possibly tomorrow too...

**Now to the SV: lost 2.2lb!! only 1lb from first goal of breaking into the 130's** 
I've only lost about 5lb in 3 weeks so this was a big drop for me! I think it's because I was always quite low carb anyway

I am really thankful that I have great support from everyone around me. My brother is also on keto so we talk about it quite a bit when we hang out. Getting my mom to understand what is carb was challenging but now she totally gets it too. My bf's family not once looked at me like a crazy person when i took out my own 'bread' at dinner. Hung out with my bf's brother and his gf and they would pick a place to eat dinner where I can order steak, bacon, cream cheese, &amp; whipping cream, and puts up with the fact that our dinners are getting more expensive, but he has also handled the shamefully regular parade of ""i think I'm thinner, do you think I'm thinner? I need more water/I need a bathroom, I HATE the scale!!"" with such patience

Thanks for listening guys!!! I hope the 130's come real soon :)

Hi there


I've read the FAQ, with no change in measurements.


My [side silhouette](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#0) is the only 'progress pic' I'm brave enough to show you - and the one which most clearly shows 'change'. Here the light blue is my original

There is also this [summary](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#4) of weight loss and measurements &gt;_&gt;

I can only conclude I've been doing something wrong...

-----

*Because I'm not sure how big these images will display

-----


I know you can't really help me unless you know what I've been eating - so as a visual summary (each axis equal with time):

* [Average Macros](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#3)

* [Weight with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#5) - (with the bump in the middle being shark week ofcourse)

* [Calories with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#6) - I altered my goals (dotted lines) for these when when I lost the weight and at the end of the first week and again at the first month to try and aid some weight loss. 

I know that my calorie intake has varied

* [Macros with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#7) - also changed these at the end of the first week and month - no help though

* [Fat/Water/Muscle % with time](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#8)

And for those of you who actually prefer figures...

* [Table of daily measurements](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#2)

* [Table of daily macro/calorie values/percentages](http://imgur.com/a/eTki8#1). I know these vary - but I sorta assumed the higher the fat the better. 

With the macros I've been good with my carbs except for two moments where I ate out and thought I was being good but fell foul to the demon of salad dressing &gt;_&gt;But on those cases i've checked my keto state the day after and so I know I've never been out of ketosis.

Keto: I wasn't too worried about dropping carbs

I did drink broth my first day - but didn't experience anything I would call the keto-flu. I did discover bullet-proof coffee/tea and fatbombs this week. These were neccesary when I found myself just HUNGRY about 2 hours after eating. During the week I was just not going to hack it with only the food that was laid out on the food plan. But it got better. By the end of the week I was much less hungry. 

My weekend has been a little odd because I have gotten a killer sore throat/sinus pain thing going on right now. I don't blame keto - I blame my husband for getting it first and giving it to me. I usually eat thru sore throat pain

I have lost almost 5 pounds this week. I'm dipping into numbers I haven't seen in awhile and it's very motivating. I can pull some of my pants off without unbuttoning them!

Pros: 
I am not at all tempted to 'cheat' and have easily passed up carby items and treats that are around the house for the kids/husband. 
Husband likes the diet as well - cuz he gets some yummy foods (He's sweet enough to live on whatever I make him

I've been off of medication (under a doctor's supervision) for over 5 years and was feeling great.

I was feeling great and after several years, complacency kicked in, I ate more than I should, stopped exercising and I've put on close to 20 lbs.  I started Keto because it seemed do-able and husband-friendly.  Well, since starting recently, my mood has suffered something awful.

But I am no where near the 130 pound stick I once was. And I don't want to be *that girl* again.

What I'm trying to get at is that our weight shouldn't define us. Being *attractive* is a plus, forget that. I was beautiful at 180 pounds, but no one ever thought to tell me. I was judged based on my weight by peers, family and employers, not who I was on the inside.

I woke up this morning feeling very down. I haven't been to the gym in about a week and a half (parents visiting = very busy and stressed) and my diet (because of said parents) has been pretty bad.

I started running when I moved down south but I have a lot of difficulty in my hips (either snap-hip or arthritis) and my body started shutting down. Recently I switched over to lifting, as that wasn't my goal, but now I feel like I need to start losing again because my clothes aren't fitting (not just in the thighs) and I'm too poor to replace them. So I've been doing some cardio (either running or elliptical) after lifting and reducing my calorie intake. I've seen no progress. No body comp changes, no weight changes but a slight loss in lifting.

When I was making breakfast this morning, so I'm mentally preparing for that.

I've been measuring progress via measurements (versus scale)

About 40-50 of that would have come on in last year. Last time I've had such rapid gain was when I first fell ill. I suppose a benefit of keto is that it's helped me realize how poorly I've been feeling during that time. My greatest fear has been that I would get sick again

I'm realizing that I am not only really fat (like a news crew might film me walking around from thw neck down to illustrate a story on the obesity epidemic kind of fat) but possibly really sick again. It's motivated me to make lots of doctor's appointments (had a basic blood draw results pending though I won't get results for at least a couple of weeks because I am out of country for 2 weeks starting tomorrow) but also I feel really afraid.

I guess I am just feeling truly overwhelmed right now: I have a lot to weight to lose

I have been on Keto for a month now. :) I have had two cheat days: one where I just really wanted a gosh darn cheesy calzone (and boy was it delicious) and the second was when I had GERD (I thought I was dying!!) and the doctor at the clinic told me to eat bread and stuff that I can't eat on this diet, nuggets, and a burger. The fries, although cooked perfectly, tasted gross, and the bread on the burger? Soggy. The nuggets I barely got through. Ech. 

Anyway! I'm 148.2 as of this morning!! I am SO happy! Last year it took me MONTHS

I have officially cut out all fake sugar as well. I can have a coke zero every now and then, my stomach gets mad at me and starts hurting like hell. If I make my own frozen yogurt (SO GOOD), it hurts. So I'm cutting it out. I could try other fake sugars, but I figured it would be better for my stomach, and my pocket book, to not try. I will enjoy a coke zero every now and then, though

Shark week is next week. We shall see what challenges lie ahead with that!

**Short version: appetite has dropped off a lot, weight loss has not-unexpectedly been minimal (reasons given), and I’m still fighting on forcing enough fat into my diet after years of fat-phobia indoctrination. Lovin’ life, keto on!**

I’ll do the bullet list here in a second, more awake, stronger, and more resilient. I’ve taken to dancing for about 30 minutes every day (my 43 year old white woman moves, they are blinding!!!) just because I have so much energy to burn in the evenings that I want to get up and do something. (It’s less a workout than playtime, but I still work up a sweat and I love it.) I’m waking up *awake* which is also highly unusual for me. Even if I never lose a pound I don’t think I would change back to my old eating habits. This is just too good. 

For all the nitty gritty details:

~ Most significantly, the most I have for “dinner” is a snack, because I’m just not hungry for a full meal. Still, when I say “eat most of my calories” I mean, basically, a low-carb protein shake made with coconut milk, bulletproof coffee, and one small lunch of either a slice of egg casserole a bowl of hamburger scramble w/ cream cheese. I will sometimes stuff a boiled egg or a fat bomb in right before I leave work at 5pm for the walk to the bus station, make a dessert out of a fat bomb, and whoa

~ My period was different. Mind you, and not for the better. Ugh. So when I say “my period was different” what I’m really saying is that it was more like the periods I used to have before the IUD: short, medium flow, low-to-no cramps. It was a welcome change, believe you me!

~ My energy has increased, I’ll walk to work from the downtown bus plaza, rather than wait 10 minutes for the connecting bus, just because I feel like walking instead of sitting (I get to work at the same time regardless).  And as I wrote above, I get the urge to dance when I get home after work, whereas before I could barely peel myself up from where ever I landed when I walked through the door. This is HUGE, I have to say. It also supports something that nearly knocked me flat when I read it in one of Taubes’ books (and I paraphrase): “Maybe marathon runners aren’t thin because they run

~ Also as I referenced above, but suddenly I’m feeling a lot sharper and more mentally energetic, to go along with the increased physical energy. 

~ Disappointingly but unsurprisingly, actually, get my size 16 jeans up over my hips where I couldn’t do that before) they fit. I say “unsurprisingly” for a couple of reasons: one, I’m not counting calories or carbs, and while I am good at “eyeballing” I’m sure I come over/under occasionally; two, I’m using splenda in my fat bombs, of which I have two or three a day – I’d rather use something else, and **I’m open to suggestions that aren’t sucralose, 30 years so I know my metabolism is just one hot mess and might take more than a month to really adapt to ketosis…I mean, I know I’ve been in ketosis every day

~ My biggest hurdle has been upping my fat content, okay? It just is. :P 

Finally, starches, and sugar while pushing a high (at least 60%) fat intake without calorie counting. Since counting/tracking *anything* is a mild ED for me, one that can get out of hand quickly, this is the best version for me mental-health wise, even if weight loss will take longer. Trade offs, I make them!

I put my horrifying stats in my flair for all to see. I've lost copious amounts of weight twice in the past. Once, resulting in infertility. So I had a baby a little over 3 years ago and afterwards, packed the weight back on. In the 3 years after having my son, I managed to gain 72 lbs. And that doesn't include the weight I gained when I was pregnant... because I had lost all of that weight by about 6 weeks PP. So yeah, not my best 3 years weight-wise for sure. But I am back at it and my husband discovered keto and for the sake of convenience (not cooking multiple meals), I decided to try it with him. I am on day 6 and have lost 7 lbs. In the 2 or 3 months prior to starting keto, I was doing more calorie counting and juicing and that is where I lost the initial 12 lbs. 

The last 6 days have not been entirely easy. I'm always thirsty and my sugar cravings are rampant. Oh, however I have been slightly irritable. I chalk it up to a lack of seratonin in my brain due to no carbs. And I think the BIGGEST struggle is having a 3 year old who loves carbs. I don't feel comfortable taking his carbs away since he's so young and healthy, but having things like cereal and crackers and fruit in the house is really tough. Any moms out there can probably relate, but there have been numerous times in the last 6 days where I have had to stop myself from not just tossing a piece of cereal or Goldfish cracker in my mouth, out of sheer habit.

There seems to be a lot of disagreement as to whether calories count or not when living low-carb (and when they might count)

What I am going to ask is something I can't seem to find either by searching Reddit or the Internet in general. Let's assume that regardless of low-carbing, unless there are some specific benefits of lowering calorie count *and* carb count at the same time. To me, that would suggest that the low-carb naysayers are right: that all low-carbing accomplishes is lowering your caloric intake, so you might as well not give up carbs if they matter to you.

So, say, counting calories and upping fat/protein intake without restricting carbs so heavily?

They're pretty simple actually: money

I am already pretty close to the poverty line and I'm about to sink even closer to it as I take a cut in hours so I can continue my degree. I'm very short on money and the fact is that carbs are cheaper and easier than what's required of ketoing. Also

I've been trying to untangle all these factors for a while now and I'm having a lot of trouble. 

I have a few ideas:

I think making a bunch of meals ahead of time and freezing them would work really well so that way I only have to really cook once every week or every two weeks. Also that would help with time too. 

I'm thinking about using some of my birthday money to get a decent protein shake (one of those big bags). That would help for those times when I don't have anything on hand and the thought of cooking a full meal is too much.

1366508011.0,1crxtq,New here!,vandalsgirl,14,1,13,"Hi xxketo!  I'm new to this subreddit

I've been doing keto for just over a month to try to get back to my previous weight/size from a few years ago.  I have about 25 pounds I'd like to lose

A little background:
Over the last few years I gained 25-30 pounds that I just haven't been able to get rid of.  I had to donate all of my old clothes because none of them fit anymore, so I decided to exercise more this time, thinking that might be the key.)  I didn't lose one single pound during that time.  In fact, I gained two, and hoped it was muscle, but the body fat analyzer at the gym I go to said I gained a percentage of body fat.  (How accurate are those hand held analyzers, anyway?)  Since I've been eating keto style, I need belts to hold my pants up when I didn't need them before

A few NSV's I've noticed....(besides the pants getting too big) are that my stomach has completely calmed down.  I have IBS-D, no problems whatsoever, it's been so nice.  Anyone else with IBS experienced this?  Another thing I've noticed is that my energy is literally through the roof!  The first few weeks of this diet I was tired, cranky, could barely climb the stairs at work, and once that passed now I feel like I have energy to spare.  It's made me obsessed with jogging for some reason, I feel great when I'm out in the fresh air jogging and it seems like such a great way to spend this extra energy.  My typical exercises before starting boot camp in January were using the elliptical and sometimes the stair master, but this feels so much better! 

So that's my story! :)

After going back on keto early in my third trimester to begin to starve off a systemic yeast overgrowth, here's what I've found.

First of all, as the content and PH of that soup changes constantly depending on your mood and what you eat. Kiddo will taste the flavor of your food within 5 minutes.

Secondly, and suddenly having pipe-cleaner arms and no thigh muscles to speak of isn't a blast either.

Thirdly, you will either slow your gains or lose weight depending on your own insulin sensitivity and weight at the time you begin eating low-carb. This MAY be a concern. 

In RARE cases of weight loss, this is very easy to spot and correct. Normal uterine measurements, routinely done, will catch it right away.

I have been advised not to be concerned about fat-soluble toxins being released due to weight loss (actual use by the body); when the fat is actually used as opposed to the system being flushed in any other way (a la detox)

Lastly, and insulin is used by the fetus as well as mother, so even if you eat more carbs you will rarely experience the unpleasant side-effects from carb-loading or blood sugar spiking. Insulin is actually a growth trigger in kids and infants, which was a TIL for me. Ketosis will stunt a child's growth. Thankfully, a fetus's needs are minimal and can be addressed by just not eating for induction phase.

Warning: Long Read Ahead! (Skip to TL;DR for pics @ Bottom)

Hello fellow xxketoers!

It's my first photo Friday and I thought I would share my progress with keto so far. I was introduced to keto/low carb and this subreddit by my ex-bf/now best friend who's dabbled in it.

On examining my diet shortly before starting, low fat recipes with vegetables and salad and occasional vegan ""passables"" such as vegan candy bars and cupcakes. The politics/other vegans were getting under my skin too and co-workers were bringing treats to the office too many times after Xmas. And when I was a teen, I ate a lot of fast food and pizza, so my diet has been slowly improving over the past few years. 

At my heaviest

Since starting this ""diet""

* I've had steady energy throughout the day and love how I don't need to be eating a lot to feel full.

* Some of my clothes stared to fit better and have even gotten too big for me to wear. It's getting to the point where I've bought an even smaller bra today (band size from 36 to a 34

* I've noticed that I've lost a lot of weight in regards to fat rather than losing fat and muscle mass. I notice that my muscles have been defined in places like in my arms

* I feel as if I can run, I have an old injury in my left knee cap (unstable due to a 12 year old basketball mishap) and I've noticed that I haven't had a lot of pain in the joint since eating naturally-occurring fats. It seems to have more elasticity (the good kind) and bounce back, as if I'm not even injured. I was afraid what would happen since re-injuries were common before I lost weight being a vegetarian, but I think eating fat helps immensely. 

* I've been really good at staving off carby temptations compared with trying to adhere to a vegan diet. This might be due to me eating some ""cheat"" meals and desserts and me waking up zonked the next morning from a huge insulin crash. I guess one harsh lesson is one too many and I've also noticed (as other people do here) that most carb-rich foods don't have a lot of flavor in and of themselves

A few goals for Summer/Fall include:

* Trying to get into eating more vegetarian friendly keto meals from /r/vegetarianketo. Just because I'm not vegetarian/vegan doesn't mean I despise vegetables. In fact

* Will also try some IF to see what works best with my metabolism and work schedule and see what succeeds.

* Should track my food more closely on MFP. I do have an account

* Probably going to include some fitness goals in with my weight loss goals. I don't think I'll ever be the kind of gal who'll fit into size 0 jeans since I'm pretty muscular

As far as goals are concerned, I want to say that I want to fit comfortably into a size 10 pair of jeans (not a 12 for jeans and dress pants) and get down to 155 pounds by the end of August. Does that goal seem feasible? I do want to see if I can even get back to the way my body was when I was vegan last Thanksgiving at 150 pounds. Being that slim was a nice place to be...

Anyway here are pics from me in April and on the Fourth of July for comparison. I'm not sure if I can spot a difference

TL;DR: ""Diet"" is going well for this former vegan. Losing weight and feeling good. Unsure about future goals

My situation (if you don't mind analyzing for a second) is that I have been doing this for 4/5 days now. I was on my monthly when I started and it seems to be heavier in general. (Significantly more so during the days I been keto-ing) So, if you aren't familiar, is the one with hormones so that eventually I won't have a monthly anymore. My first monthly after getting Mirena was extremely light but lasted forever. Now this one is seeming to last awhile but extremely heavier. 


Thank you for any advice and I am sorry about my detailed monthly descriptions... I am not one to talk about it but I feel comfortable here in XXketo. Thanks ladies.",,t5_2u80h,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/v7swp/does_keto_ketosis_make_periods_heavier_also_birth/

I've been threatening to start keto for months now and finally realizing that it's time to try it out. My birthday is in two weeks and I'd love to fit back into some old clothes for the big 2-5.

About two years ago

I work A LOT and legitimately don't have much time for the gym anymore...any home workouts you guys like on DVD or YouTube? I'm really into Pilates and Yoga incorporated into workouts. 

I'd love some friends on MFP and any helpful encouragement you might have for starting out. Any advice on setting macros for keto in MFP?

MFP: anp3g

I'm looking forward to going on this journey with you all!

-------------------

For example

* Fasting has different endocrine effects on male and female rats.

*In male rats*:

No matter the duration or degree of nutritional stress, males will get a little wonky and frantic, but overall they maintain pretty well. It’s like they’re equipped with the ability to handle nutritional stressors.

*In female rats*:

Any degree of nutritional stress (fasting or mere caloric restriction) causes increased wakefulness (during the day, hyper alertness, and more energy. In short, female rats become better at finding and acquiring food when they fast, as if their bodies aren’t as well-equipped to deal with the stress of going without food. They also become less fertile, while the males actually become hornier and more fertile (probably to account for the females’ plummeting fertility). Ovary size drops (bad for fertility), adrenal gland size increases (which in rats indicates exposure to chronic stress)

* And the few human studies performed: One study, female subjects saw no such improvement. In fact, the glucose tolerance of fasting women actually worsened.

* Later, blood pressure, total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and triglyercides on a fasting regimen. These people were obese, however, and perimenopausal women were excluded from the study

* but Mark's Daily Apple article theorises: ""*In fact

So, how they felt it worked (or didn't) etc
