My mom passed away a few years ago. I needed help trying to recreate a chicken recipe of hers that I have been craving

I was nervous as I was putting it together. I felt like there had to be something more to it

I took chicken cutlets and hammered them flat. Dredged in flour and sauteed in butter (high heat). I burned the butter a little. I remembered my mom saying that butter is the one thing that is ok to burn (as long as it is not smoking furiously) so I left it alone

I deglazed the empty pan with chardonnay. My mom wasn't a big wine person, because it would splash a little. I felt like I was nine years old again.

I added three big dollops of sour cream and dissolved it in the hot wine. I didn't know what I was going to do next

I added a couple spoonfuls of the liquid from the canned peaches to take away a little of the wine's tartness

Keep in mind that I am no food stylist

The whole thing took less than 20 minutes to make. And I fucking nailed it. Thank you so

I DID get it from the dental hygienist ([Pic of email](http://i.imgur.com/VuOild2.png)) but either she couldn't find the original recipe and just sent me this one or she was bullshitting the entire time.

Either way


The [Hot Brown](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_Brown) is a dish native to the Brown Hotel in Louisville

My wife and I were traveling through

THIS is what it looks like when you order it at the Brown Hotel: http://i.imgur.com/McQ7c.jpg

I was at the dentist last week and there was a new girl there. She mentioned she was from Louisville, she sent it over, so without further ado:

Ingredients (Makes Two Hot Browns):

2 oz. whole butter

2 oz. all-purpose flour

16 oz. heavy cream

1/2 cup Pecorino Romano cheese

Salt &amp; pepper to taste

14 oz. sliced roasted turkey breast

2 slices of Texas toast (crusts trimmed)

4 slices of crispy bacon

2 Roma tomatoes

Paprika

Parsley

In a two-quart saucepan, about 2-3 minutes. Remove sauce from heat and slowly whisk in Pecorino Romano cheese until the Mornay sauce is smooth. Add salt and pepper to taste.

For each Hot Brown

Take the two halves of Roma tomato and set them alongside the base of turkey and toast. 

Next

Sprinkle with additional Pecorino Romano cheese. 

Place entire dish under a broiler until cheese begins to brown and bubble. 

Remove from broiler, and serve immediately.",,False,,t5_2qh56,1373505959.0,,

1363307549.0,1abjgv,Grilled Cheese - A beginners guide,Googunk,315,95,114,"Eventually it is expected that you will make your own bread

When I was 4 through 10 years old, slathered in mayonnaise, cooked dry on the George foreman or nearly deep fried in canola oil.  Dipping that into plain campbell's tomato remains a vivid memory for me.  But I'm a big boy now, and I deserve a big boy sandwich.  It's time to lose the wonderbread, the partially hydrogenated cheese simulant, and the can of red food coloring in sour water.  Today we drop artificial ingredients and learn how to make this childhood favorite into something that even people with bank accounts will salivate over.

A few disclaimers: The first set of instructions are not a recipe.  They are tips to make your own perfect grilled cheese, I mean that it is not difficult.  It can still be complicated.  Towards the end, you will find my personal recipe, which is admittedly complicated and time consuming .  The recipe is intermediate level, but only because it contains caramelized onions.  All other elements are something even a first timer can handle.  However, my recipe is not the best recipe, there is no such thing.  Everyone has their own favorite, which can be any difficulty level you choose.  In short

**GUIDE TO GRILLED CHEESE**

**BREAD:** Something light and airy with a hearty crust.  Are you 8 years old? No? Then leave the damn crust on.  My preference is sourdough diamante

**FAT:** The essential rule is that the fat be solid at room temperature.  To most simple kitchens this means butter, do not butter the pan.  You can look into other fats later, but if you don't know what you are doing, butter has the best quality:difficulty ratio.

**PAN:** don't use something bowl shaped, which is a much better application for these ingredients.  I know it's an easy fallacy to succumb to, but retired boxers don't know much about home cooking appliances and should not be taken at their word.  That particular contraption has some uses, but this is not one of them, so keep your grilled cheese on the stovetop.

**CHEESE:** The only wrong answer is one.  I am a cheese polygamist.  A single cheese is boring and I don't believe any one cheese embodies all the factors you desire from your sandwich.  My preference is equal parts medium cheddar and fresh mozzarella (the kind packed in water, and/or parmesean.  The key is one flavorful cheese, one melty cheese, and a pinch of stinky cheese.  Please do not use Velveeta, american cheese, and anything that has to explicitly state it is a ""food product"" on the label.  They are not cheese.  If you prefer these products to actual cheese, then your opinion is incorrect.

**FILLINGS:** There is room for more than just cheese.  Only the stuffiest of purists would say otherwise.  I like whole basil leaves and caramelized onions.  Only thing you can do wrong is put something crunchy inside the sandwich.  The grilled bread is your crunch, and other flesh candy.  Remember to keep these soft or in the case of bacon least brittle enough to bite through easily.

**SOUP:** Not required, boxed, or *shudder* concentrated tomato soup tastes like shit.  Add red pepper flakes, fresh rosemary, and fresh basil leaves cut julienne.  Can sub in dried rosemary, but leave your dried basil in the pantry where it belongs.  Dipping the sandwich in the soup is optional.  I enjoy a gentleman's dip now and again myself.

Why is tomato a necessity?  Think pizza.  Tomato sauce, toppings - Sounds like tomato soup, bread melted cheese, and fillings to me.  I think everyone can agree that pizza's flavors are perfect, so that's what we're making here.  It's a fried cheese pizza sandwich with dipping soup.  Without tomato sauce, pizza would be cheezy bread.  You know what people do with cheezy bread?  Dip it in marinara sauce because someone didn't have the foresight to put some tomato sauce on it!

**COOKING:** Golden. Brown.  No black.  Little if any white.  Should be easy to achieve with buttered sourdough.  Turn after 1 or 1 1/2 minutes or so on each side, or try again.  The most common problem cooks report is that the cheese isn't melting.  This is because the heat isn't reaching the center of the sandwich.  Either use thinner bread, turn down the heat (make sure it stays at frying temp!), or cover the pan for the first half of cooking.  Do not cover for the second half of cooking, covering traps heat but also traps moisture and if you leave the lid on the result may be a steamed cheese sandwich instead.  The soup should be steaming, but not boiling.

**EATING:** If anyone is watching: cut the sandwich in half, put a tarp or plate down on the floor to protect your carpet and then try to put as much of the sandwich in your mouth as will fit at one time.  Reverse blow to cool the contents in your mouth.  Don't chew, just disintegrate the ingredients by hydrating them with spit and sucking the essence away.  The flavor does not stop.

**REVIEW:** Rustic bread, 1 little bit of stinky hard cheese.  Other fillings should be soft.  Involve tomato somehow.  Apply fat to the bread, not the pan.  Use a fat which is solid at room temperature such as butter.  Use a flat pan on a burner close to the same diameter as the pan. Soup is optional, but get the tomato from another source if the soup is skipped.  Aromatic Italian herbs optional in the soup or sandwich.  Heat should be medium, just high enough to fry that butter.  Flip the sandwich infrequently to start, and then flip more and more frequently as cooking progresses.  Cook it to golden brown like medium toast.  If you see black bread, stop.  Cut it in half or else cheese gets in your lap.

You really want a recipe huh?  Subreddit title and all that?  Well OK


**""Googunk's amazing grilled cheese which is guaranteed to gain you respect, even yourself. - Recipe makes 4 sandwichgasms""**

-1 loaf rosemary or sourdough diamante

-at least 2 tbs salted butter

-4 oz medium cheddar cheese

-4 oz fresh mozzarella

-1/2 oz graded or shaved Parmesan cheese or hard cheese blend

-1 white onion

-12 leaves fresh basil

-1 sprig fresh rosemary.

-1 can or box tomato soup

If you didn't have anything on the list in your fridge already and buy everything you need, this is easily reduced to $0.25.  If you make your own mozzarella and soup, keep a basil plant in the house and a rosemary bush outside, this can cost as little as $3.

Prepare fresh mozzarella by patting dry with no-lint towel

In 1st pan

In 2nd pan, and add Italian seasoning to taste.  Be aware that fresh basil flavor will increase when warmed.  Heat to steaming, but do not allow soup to boil.  

In 3rd pan

Butter one side of each slice of bread.  Between 2 slices of bread, add 1/4 of caramelized onions and 2 basil leaves to the center of each sandwich.  

One at a time, repeat with gradually shorter increments until cheese is melted and bread is golden brown.

Cut in half, do whatever what you want.

He who controls the grilled cheese controls the universe.

Best served with meat of some kind (we are using chicken today)

Ok people

DEVIL SAUCE (with Chicken)

Ingredients.

2 tablespoons of  Yellow Mustard powder - - Example http://imgur.com/0oOIlzy

2 tablespoons of Curry Powder - Example http://imgur.com/y7urlfq

2 cups of Tomato sauce - This means Ketchup in the U.S!

2 large onions

2 lemons

2-4 large chicken breasts – sliced butterfly style so it looks like this - 

http://imgur.com/IFDtPcx

A little bit of oil to brown the chicken in

Method

In a frypan

When all the chicken is browned

Fry the 2 powders together for a minute or so (it won’t take long) then add the onion to the pan.

Fry the onion for a couple minutes

Turn the pan down to a simmer &amp; simmer that all together for around 10 minutes – stir every minute.

Pour the sauce over the chicken – cover in tinfoil / aluminium foil and cook in the oven for 90 minutes at 180c (355f)

Serve however you like. The beauty of this recipe is that it can be changed in so many ways.

Use any meat

Serve with rice or pasta or vegetables – whatever you like.

Notes on the sauce:

If you slightly increase or decrease the level of any one ingredient

1 lemon vs 2 for extra tangy

An extra teaspoon of either powder

No onion (maybe you are alergic)

Ive googled for pics of my Dad’s sauce and trawled through hundreds of photos

Thankyou for reading &amp; I really hope you enjoy this as much as I do.

My girlfriend and I were at home one evening sitting at the table thinking of what to do for dinner, I however am much more inclined to making things up on the fly and generally they turn out pretty good and since we didn't have any recipes for what we currently had in the house, she let me handle it. This is what I came up with. (this recipe has since been perfected)

**~The Absolute Most Amazing Soup In Existence~**

[Here](http://i.imgur.com/8MmyXBc.jpg) is a picture of the Soup.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
**THINGS YOU WILL NEED**

*Base Ingredients*

*Butter (about a half stick)

*Organic Chicken Stock (I think like half a quart? Idk it looks like [this](http://www.chow.com/blog-media/2011/04/costco_chicken_stock.jpg))

*Some Whole Milk

*A [large cast iron pot](http://i.imgur.com/gwWtQgu.jpg) 

*A [large cast iron skillet](http://i.imgur.com/jHsA6tG.jpg) (for THE MEATS)

===================

*VEGGIES*

*Carrots (about 4 or 5 cut longways and then in half again

*Kale ([here](http://i.imgur.com/1zkebOJ.jpg) if you don't know what kale looks like

*Potatoes (yukon gold or red)

*Leeks! (2 maybe one if it's large...like your mom)

*Some Shallots

*Some Onions (any kind will do

*A fucking Jalapeno

*Anaheim Chili Peppers (2)

*A clove of vampire repellant (also helps to keep [this](http://i.imgur.com/pBOb9tM.jpg) douche away)

====================

*THE MEAT*

*HALF A FUCKING POUND OF [THICK ASS PEPPER BACON](http://i.imgur.com/rFUHE4c.jpg)(I actually googled ""thick ass pepper bacon"" and that's the pic that came up

*4-pack of Andouille Sausage (http://i.imgur.com/W93UXmP.jpg)

====================

*FLAVOR MAKERS*

*1 pack of Mediterranean Flavor Feta Cheese (http://i.imgur.com/ymyrd73.jpg)

*[Salt &amp; Peppa](http://i.imgur.com/WJ8jmxd.jpg)

*Bacon drippings (I just wanted you to know that I felt old when typing that)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**THE PROCESS**

*I'm not going to go into full detail how everything should be chopped up and sliced


*1. Start by cooking the THICK ASS PEPPER BACON and the Andouille sausages in the skillet.

*2. Sautee(&lt;-sp? fuck it.) the Leeks, Kale, Jalapeno/s, Chilis and Douche Repellent with the Butter in the large cast iron pot for about 10 minutes, about half way through pour some of the grease from the bacon and sausage into the pot, you know, for flavor.

*3. Pour the entire contents of the Chicken Stock into the pot

*4. Cut up the Bacon and Sausage and add them to the pot

*5. Add about a half cup of the Half &amp; Half or a whole cup of the milk

*6. Bring to a boil then immediately reduce heat and let simmer for 10 minutes.

*7. Check to see if the Potatoes &amp; Carrots are cooked fully

*8. Eat until you pass out.

Ingredients:

1 package Hot Dogs (any variety should do)

1/4 cup water

1/2 cup ketchup 

1 Tblsp. Brown Vinegar (I discovered it's Apple Cider vinegar)

1 Tblsp. Brown Sugar (light is used here but dark works)

1 tsp. Seasoned Salt

1 tsp. Worcestershire Sauce (He used a Tblsp. Adjust to taste)

1/8 tsp. Chili powder

1/4 - 1/2 cup chopped Onion 

1-2 Tblsp. Margarine

1/2 tsp. Garlic Powder 

Mix all ingredients except onion and margarine. Set aside.
Melt margarine in a skillet. Add onions and saute for a few minutes. 
Add the hot dogs and roll 'em around for a minute or two.
Pour the sauce mix over the hot dogs.
Simmer for 10-20 minutes. 

Serves 4-8.

Variations: If you don't have onion you can use 2 Tblsp. dry onion in the seasoning aisle OR use 1-2 tsp onion powder.

You can also mince 2 cloves of garlic and add that to the onion and margarine and not the sauce mix. 

To make the sauce thicker

Suggestion:  DOUBLE the sauce mix. I haven't found anyone who doesn't like this recipe yet and he always doubled this for the extra sauce that makes these so yummy.

1345050949.0,y9qdi,I worked at a Jamie Oliver restaurant. This is my favorite recipe from my time there; Sicilian Caponata,JRC87,195,31,41,"Caponata 

Takes about an hour

Soffrito of 1 Onion

Dried oregano or majoram

2 Aubergines 

Tomato paste

Red wine

Pine nuts about 100g (if you are feeling wealthy)

2 tins tomatoes or 1 tin and a couple of handfuls of cherry toms. 

Red wine vinegar

Tbsp of coco powder

Handful of good olives sliced in half.

Ok

Set oven to 160oc and put the cherry toms in. You can forget about them

Whenever you get close to the end of chopping the soffrito up get your best heavy based pan on a medium heat with a good amount of pommace or veg oil. 
By the time the oil is hot you should have finished chopping
Let this sweat away

Now get a couple of plates or a tray and line it with a few layers of kitchen roll. Next get a good sized frying pan on one of the front hot plates (you need to reach it easily). 
Get it on high. Cut the aubergines into about 2cm cubes, of pommace oil. Aubergines drink oil like the Irish drink Guinness. Tilt the pan around to coat then get in as many of the cubes as you can, until they won't touch the base. You'll probably need to do 2-3 rounds. Fry until nearly burned, to golden bordering black. Should take 4-5mins if you've got the skillz, you can do this; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=noizuQwvL0M . Otherwise use a spatula to flip it so its evenly coloured, the aubergine will have halved in size by the end. Discard onto paper. Repeat. 

Check the tomatoes in the oven
By the time you've finished frying, you are not on the road to the land of Caponata yet... If happy, turn the heat up and add a couple of tbsps of tomato paste. 'Cook out' for a few minutes until you can smell the tomato and it coats everything. When its really steaming, de-glaze the pan by pouring in about a quarter of a bottle wine, it should hiss like an angry cobra in a trap. Bring to the boil and reduce by about half. 

While its doing that, pine nuts are a bitch to burn. 
 
Once reduced you can add in the tinned tomatoes and turn the heat down to medium again. Go and watch TV. 

After about half an hour you can introduce the tomatoes

Shit

Taste

You have made Caponata. You now have the tools to go conquer the earth

Mary’s Grandma-inspired Chicken Soup


Broth:

6 bone-in chicken breasts

a large pot

salt

a palmful of bay leaves

a palmful of peppercorns


Soup:

half a bag of carrots

half a bag of celery

an onion

a few cloves of garlic

half a bouquet of parsley

half a bouquet of fresh dill

A bag of fine egg noodles


1.	Salt the water, add bay leaves and peppercorns. Return to a slow boil for 20 minutes.

2.	Add carrots, and garlic. Return to a slow boil, turn down to simmer for 20 minutes. 

3.	Add parsley and dill. Simmer for 20 minutes. 


The bayleaves and peppercorns can be made into a cheesecloth sachet to be removed if you don’t want them in your soup. You can do the same with the whole dill and parsley and remove after cooking. The chopped parsley and dill are for presentation. 


You can also remove the breasts to a cutting board and remove the bones once the soup is finished cooking. Cut up the meat for a good texture. 


The egg noodles can not be cooked into the soup
This soup is great for an upcoming busy week and delicious in the winter.

It's a chicken dish made with flat chicken cutlets. I think she used to hammer them a bit with a kitchen mallet

The sauce is the part I am a little lost about. She used white wine (probably chardonnay) and sour cream, any thoughts?

The flavor was tangy, her dishes were usually pretty simple. It is likely that this is not something she invented herself, but it might be something that she simplified. Does anyone know what this is or what it is called so I can look it up and try and get it right?

She used to serve it with grilled zucchini brushed with garlic butter.

Thank you.

**Baked Potato Soup**

4 baked potatoes

2/3  cup margarine

2/3 cup flour

6 cups milk (I substituted 2 cups of the milk for chicken stock and no one could tell.)

bacon

green onions

cheddar cheese

1 cup sour cream. 

Salt/pepper (optional)

Melt butter in your soup pot. Add flour, a bunch of bacon and some cheese. Cook until thoroughly heated. Stir in sour cream. Serve topped with extra cheese, green onion and bacon. (* The recipe is fairly flexible. I’ve put the real recipe’s suggested amounts of bacon, onions and cheese in brackets there, but I find 4 green onions is too many, 12 slices of bacon is too expensive and that amount of cheese is definitely not enough for us. Use whatever works for you.)

2/3 cup salted butter

1 1/2 cups sugar

1/4 cup brandy

4 cups semisweet chocolate chips

2 teaspoons vanilla extract

4 eggs

2 tablespoons cinnamon

1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour

1/2 teaspoon baking soda

1/2 teaspoon table salt

Coarse sea salt

**Directions**

In a saucepan, stirring constantly. Remove from the heat. Stir (with a wooden spoon) in 2 cups of chocolate chips until melted. Remember to give that spoon a lick! Cool mixture slightly. Stir in vanilla. In a large mixing bowl, beat the eggs. Gradually add the chocolate mixture and mix well. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt, then gradually add the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture. Stir in any remaining chocolate chips. Spread into a greased baking pan. Bake at 325 degrees for 35-45 minutes or until a fork inserted in the center comes out clean. Careful not to burn your balls! Let cool just enough that it won't burn your hands. Meanwhile set up a small plate or cutting board with some of the sea salt on it. Scrape up the brownie mix, working around the edges. You don't want to use the hard edges for the balls. Begin shaping 1″ balls out of the mix, give or take in size. Roll the balls in the salt. Do this very lightly (I suggest you do NOT try to emulate the picture), just brush the excess salt crystals off. Too much salt is bad

Learned this recipe from my old girlfriend's grandmother - she was even more liberal with whatever she happen to have.

People always LOVE this rice, not just an afterthought to fill up the plate.


Please take note


You can double/triple/etc this recipe.  I usually do a minimum of 2 cups, as I did it in a pot instead of a pan.


1 Cup short grain rice

1/4 cup butter

1/2 ~Medium onion (I love onion

~2 Garlic Cloves (I buy the already cut up stuff

~1 1/2 teaspoon Pepper

~1 1/2 teaspoon Salt (I usually use Kosher

2 Cups Chicken Broth  (This will actually go DOWN if you have more rice

1/2 small can of tomato SAUCE (not  paste!)  I usually just use 1 full can for 2 cups of rice.

1/2 Bunch of Cilantro.  You can also use that pre-cut tube you find near the same section


The beauty of this 'recipe'

1.  Melt Butter in pan, and some darker.  This requires some attention as depending on your stove it can burn easy.  (If it is not browning within ~5 minutes, add a bit more butter).

2.  Once you judge the rice is about 'half' done browning, salt and pepper.

3. When all finished browning, then dicing it...  I just cut off the majority of the stem, and do a semi-fine chop).

4. Bring to a boil

1342384363.0,wlv5c,Spicy Mac &amp; Cheese with Chicken and Broccoli,deannd,152,29,12,"[For step-by-step photo instructions

* 1 lb. cavatelli pasta
* 8 oz extra sharp cheddar
* 8 oz pepperjack
* salt &amp; pepper
* 1/8 tsp. garlic powder
* 2 tbsp butter
* 3 1/2 tbsp flour
* 1 1/2 cup milk
* 1 broccoli crown
* 2 tbsp oil
* 2 cloves garlic
* 1/2 onion
* 1 lb. boneless


Start by getting the broccoli &amp; chicken part cooked.  I also boiled the pasta while getting this part done. The cheese sauce requires the most attention


So first, then add onion, and cook until translucent.  Add chicken.  I used chicken thigh meat because it was on sale, but if you prefer white meat, you can use that too.  I actually love dark meat and its rich flavor.  Cook on medium-high heat until browned, about five minutes, stirring occasionally.


Add the broccoli on top, about 5 minutes.  Turn off heat, but keep cover on to retain heat.


Now on to that cheese sauce.  Start by warming a saucepan on medium heat.  Add butter but watch carefully so the butter does not burn.  Add the flour and whisk constantly for 2 minutes.  Slowly add the milk very gradually


Simmer and let thicken, and garlic powder.  Stir until incorporated.  In the pasta pot, add chicken and broccoli mixture to the pasta.  Pour cheese sauce on top, and mix all together.

Serve immediately!

Variations/substitutions:

add 1 jalapeno or serrano chili if you like it spicier.  I am known to be a spice wuss!

sub white meat for thigh meat

sub peas for broccoli

sub macaroni pasta or penne for cavatelli 

sub fontina for pepperjack

*6 limes  
*1 medium white onion  
*4-6 cloves of garlic  
*2-3 tablespoons of salt  
*1/3 to 1/2 bunch cilantro  
*5 tomatillos  
*5 to 7 jalapenos  
1. Blend Jalapenos
2. While roasting, cut the ends, and squeeze out the juice into the blender. Microwaving them and rolling them unlocks the juice.  
3. Add onion and cilantro and blend.  
4. Pour the roasted tomatillo in the blender with the lime juice mix.  
5. Cut the pineapple into quarters and add according to your preference (I used 1 quarter). The pineapple will balance out the spice. Blend all together.  
6. Add salt to taste.

1362690023.0,19v8yi,Baked Ziti w/ Chicken! College kid friendly. Easy recipe.,PriyaAvaani,129,22,10,"Hey guys

Its my first time posting to Recipes. Hope you like this simple recipe. I am a college student who is cooking for two people. Most of my recipes are tailored to servings for 2 or just enough for a leftover meal. 


Baked Ziti w/ Chicken

Ingredients
* Ziti Pasta

* Tomato Sauce (Preferably one with a certain flavoring like Garlic and Herb)

* Chicken Breast

* Mozzarella Cheese

* Parmesan Cheese

* Oregano

1. The first thing in this whole recipe would be to get your chicken cooked. I chose to season my chicken with salt, minced green scallion (this is my special ingredient, ask in comments if you would like this recipe), garlic powder, onion powder and ""complete seasoning"". This is of course how I choose to season my chicken. Any other combination of spices are welcome here. I also thought about using a cajun type flavor combination to give this entire recipe a slight *kick*.

   1a. Put a pot of boiling water on the stove to start cooking our ziti. Once water has come to a roiling boil     throw in ziti and let cook for 8-10 mins. Once it is cooked. Drain water and put aside.

2. Grill the chicken breasts. Try to make sure that the pieces aren't too thick. I used my panini grill to cook my chicken as I don't have a better grilling appliance in my apartment. It works fantastic as a grill!! (Highly recommend for any college student)

3. Once chicken is finished cut up into small strips. I would say about have the length of your pinky. We want to be able to ""sprinkle the chicken so that we get it in each bite. Then put aside and we will come back to this later. 

4. Get a medium sized baking dish. Preferably one that is more deep than shallow. No need to line the dish with nonstick stuff!!

5. Grab your already cooked ziti and put a layer on the bottom of the dish. Attempt to make it cover the bottom of the dish without stacking 5 pieces of ziti on top of each other!

6. Sprinkle your already cooked chicken strips on top of the pasta. Make sure to get every corner as we want chicken in each bite!

7. Take your pasta sauce and completely cover this layer of chicken and ziti.

8. Sprinkle Mozzarella on top of sauce. 

9. Repeat the layering process once more. Ziti, and then mozzarella.

10. As the second layer is your last year I added a small amount of parmesean cheese on top of the mozzarella for an added pazaaz. Then with a light hand

11. Bake at 350 degrees for around 15 mins. The dish won't be ""hard on the edges"" but will just have heated up enough to melt the cheese and infuse the pasta sauce flavor into the chicken and ziti. 

12. Cut and serve it up!


All the measurements will be up to you depending on how many people you're serving. For the ziti pasta I used about 2 1/2 cups for two people. The dish made enough for leftovers for the next day for both of us.

boiled palatts (tongue! – optional)

3 hard boiled egg yolks

3 large meatballs

1/2 cup cooked chopped bacon

artichoke hearts

1-2 Tbs. bacon grease

1 egg for glazing

Roll out pastry dough and drape over the pan. Gently press the dough into the pan to make sure it molded to the sides and bottom. Trim the excess dough and reshape into a ball- this will be your lid.


Put your pigeons in a large pot and cover with water. Simmer for around 45 minutes


Season the meat with your spices, then flatten the meatballs to form the next layer. Sprinkle the bacon over that, then lay sliced artichoke hearts on the very top. Pour the bacon grease evenly over the top.


Roll out the remaining pastry dough and cut into a circle the size of the bottom of the pan. Lay this circle over the pie filling, flute the edges in a decorative pattern, and brush the whole thing with beaten egg.

Bake at 350 for 45 minutes to an hour

1 tbsp. coconut oil

1 tbsp. bacon grease

¼ tsp. cayenne

* 3/4 cups quinoa
* 15 ounces rinsed black beans
* 30 ounces diced tomatoes
* 5 ounces chicken (about one small boneless/skinless chicken breast)
* 1 medium	onion
* 1 tbsp fresh minced garlic
* 1 teaspoon dried Italian herbs (oregano, rosemary mix)

* 1 teaspoon black pepper
* 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper
* 1 cup Veggie Shreds monterrey and cheddar cheese mix
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* 1 packet no sodium chicken bouillon
* 1 1/2 cups	 water


**Directions**:

Preheat oven to 350°F.

Dice onion and garlic.

Heat 1 tbsp oil in large pan or dutch oven over medium heat. Add onion and garlic and cook until translucent (about five minutes).

Add 1 teaspoon cumin and all cayenne and pepper. Stir in drained tomatoes

Stir in black beans, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer 20 minutes, or until quinoa is tender. Stir in 1 cup cheese.

While quinoa is cooking
Cook chicken in 1 tbsp olive oil until 180 degrees

While chicken is cooking

Pour liquid from tomatoes in bottom of baking dish.

Stir chicken into quinoa mix. Fill each bell pepper half with heaping 3/4-cup quinoa mixture

Drizzle each pepper with pan juices before serving. Optional: sprinkle each pepper with additional cheese.

5 servings. 390 calories per serving.

This can easily be made vegetarian by omitting the chicken and changing the chicken bouillon to vegetable. It can be made vegan by omitting the cheese.

And the next day's meal? Just add water. The amount of vegetables and cooking time will depend on how big your chicken is

**Ingredients**

* 1 whole chicken
* 2 carrots
* 2 stalks celery
* 1 onion
* 4-5 potatoes
* olive oil
* herbs of your choice
* salt and pepper
* garlic or onion **powder**

**Method for Roast Chicken**

1. Wash and dry your chicken. Let it sit uncovered in the fridge for 1-2 hours before you start cooking it. This process dries out the skin so when you stick it in the oven it will get crispy and not steam. As usual

2. Get a roasting pan

3. In a bowl

4. If there is left over olive oil in the potato bowl, I suggest about a 1/4 olive oil (maybe less). Sprinkle on the garlic or onion powder.

5. Place the bird, then turn back to crisp up the skin.

6. Make some separate vegetables if you want. I suggest only eating the roasted potatoes. Serve with a salad

**Method for Chicken Soup**

1. Shred left over meat and set aside.
2. Put the vegetables that made the bed for the chicken and bones in a crock pot. Fill with water so that it covers everything. Add a few bay leaves.
4. Cook on low for 12 hours.
5. Remove the bones and vegetables
6. Strain the broth through a cheesecloth
7. Transfer to glass jars or glass containers and stick it in the fridge to cool. Try not to use plastic.
8. Skim off any fat once cooled and put any extra in the freezer.
9. Cook vegetables you want in a little olive oil until soft. Add in the cooled broth. Add a little water and simmer.
10. Add back the shredded chicken and noodles on medium heat and cook until noodles are done.

Add some garlic salt and pepper and throw on the shrimp. Once the shrimp are pink add the tomato alfredo sauce and add your desired amount of garlic salt.

Butter chicken is supposed to be made as two seperate dishes that you subsequently mix together. The chicken has to be cooked (almost tandoori styles) and then mixed in with the mugh makni masala (Butter chicken spices...in this case in the form of a thick  gravy). 
Also, treat yourself from time to time.


As with all cooking


For the Tandoori Paste (make 2 days in advance) 


1 tsp Garlic Powder


1 tsp Ground ginger 

1tsp Clove (use powder if you're not using a magic bullet
cloves if you are )

1/2 tsp nutmeg

1tsp Mace powder

1 1/2 tbsp Cumin (Jeera) 

2tbsp ground Corriander 

1tsp Fenugreek powder

1tsp Cinnamon 

1tsp Fresh ground pepper 

2tsp brown cardamom (don't use the green one....just don't)

3tbsp of Oil/ Ghee (Indian vegetable lard..yum!)


Then toss that into your magic bullet/food processor and puree the crap together until it forms a paste. This will be sufficient for about 1kg of chicken.


Let the paste sit overnight so the flavours meld together
Remember people


For the Chicken:

Cube 1kb of chicken breast. Trim off all fat (cause this is already unhealthy enough) and then coat with the Tandoori paste. Refridgerate over night. 

For the Butter chicken sauce

1 tsp red chilli powder (remember, so don't over do it with the spice) 

3 bay leaves 

1 cinnamon stick 

8 cardamom pods 

8 pepper corns

3 Onions chopped (I like onions
free to use less)

2 tsp corriander power 

2 tsp cumin 

1 tsp ginger (crushed) 

1 can tomatoe paste

2 tbsp dried fenugreek (raw seeds will work as well) 

4 tbsp butter (Deal with it)

salte to taste 


1 cup FULL FAT CREAM (yeah, and it's fucking amazing....ok you can use low fat yogurt, but seriously, treat yourselves, it's not like you drink  1 cup of cream a day...or at least dear god I hope not) 


So mix ALL of this together and blend it. If you have a magic bullet


FOR THE CHICKEN that has been marinating over night: 

Bring a frying pan with about 2 tbsp of oil to a medium heat. Then fry the chicken. Fry to the point where it's past browning


FOR THE SAUCE

Bring your cream/yogurt mix to a boil. If it's the Yogurt you chose
Once this has reached a low boil
Let the chicken cook in the sauce for about 20 - 30 minutes and BAM! Butter chicken. 
Serve on Basmati rice garnished with cilantro :)

The inclusion of mushroom stock added an intense umami flavour throughout the sauce. Noticeably absent are shallots (forgot to buy them!) and brandy (too damn expensive!).

The cooking process comprises two stages (three if you don't have meat stock handy). The mushroom stock can be made in advance

**Ingredients**

**For the mushroom stock**

550g assorted mushrooms (I used a combination of baby button
2 cloves garlic  
A few curly parsley stalks (leaves picked and reserved)  
6 sprigs thyme  
1 tsp white wine vinegar or lemon juice

Mushroom stock  
3 chestnut mushrooms
1 tsp English or Dijon mustard  
Worcestershire sauce  
Reserved parsley leaves
80 ml single cream

You'll need... a large 12""-13"" frying pan or Wok (I like using a Wok)

**Ingredients** 

* 1 lb Mild Italian Sausage or Turkey Sausage - I prefer regular ground pork
* 1/2 lb Fettucini Noodles (or half a package of dry fettucini)
* 3-4 Cups of Baby Arugula 
* 1/2 Tsp ground black pepper
* 2 Tbsp of Minced Garlic (I like the jarred minced garlic in olive oil
* 1 Pint of Cherry or Grape Tomatoes
* 1 Package of Shaved Parmesan, in any combination

**Directions**

Step 1. Begin by preparing your pasta. I use dried/boxed fettucini and have worked out how to cook it aldente during my college days. Boil the pasta until it is just soft enough to be malleable (5-8 minutes)

Step 2. Heat some olive oil in your frying pan over medium. Start browning your Sausage and breaking it up into smaller pieces. When meat is starting to turn grey, about 1/2 cup of cheese, and arugula leaves. Let simmer for another minute uncovered for cheese to melt. Plate your meal and sprinkle some shaved cheese on top for garnish. 

It's one of the simplest

----------------------------

I want to give credit to Ivy Manning for this recipe even though I might have put my own suggestions in for ingredients and cooking instructions. It's simple to make and just sooooo tasty!

The recipe is a ratio based on how much meat you have. So don't throw the wrapper away before you know how many pounds of meat you have.


Use whole chicken thighs with skin on. Or a nice hunk of pork with some fat to it


For every one pound of meat: 

- two smashed cloves garlic
- two bay leaves
- two ounces of apple cider vinegar 


One tea bell full of [pickling spice](http://whatscookingamerica.net/Q-A/PicklingSpice.htm) per pot. 


**Directions**

1) put garlic

2) place meat on top of the spices

3) fill with water just enough so that the meat is submerged

*3.5) Optional: add a few table spoons of tomato paste to the pot if you are making chicken version. Not so great with the pork version.*

4) bring to a boil and then cook on medium until meat is cooked through. Add soy sauce to taste if you like. Serve over rice.

First

 While it's heating up, and anything you want to put into your omelette. 

Break the eggs into the bag

Seal the bag and mush it with your hands until you have it all solidly mixed together. The yolks should break while you do this.

When the water has come to a rolling boil

When the time's up

Poke the omlette with a fork before removing it to see if it is done. It should be fairly resistant

If it's done

It's that easy

1354841587.0,14ezua,What I want from a recipe search site...,kimmay172,74,14,13,"I want a recipe web site where I can enter the name of a recipe

Example::

**Search**: Banana bread

**Results**: 20 recipes

**View**: Using a cloud/Venn diagram/graph presentation it would show that 15 of the recipe are actually very similar and form one cluster. The other recipes would form their own groups or float on their own. The outliers are different because maybe they are vegan or gluten free, or some that have more or less of various ingredients, or see which recipes are exact copies of each other. 

To me this would be much more useful than picking a recipe because it has extra votes or super pretty pictures. And I am sure that there is some super cool way to present this information in a useful way. 

There is one recipe comparison site out there now

Maybe I should start a Kickstarter project for this... anyone else think this would be useful? Or this will be my retirement project... or some Redditor will take this idea and make a million dollars with it.




**Update: New Info relative to comments:**



**What is the problem I am having?**

Answer: I don't like how currently one has to sort between the results for recipe searches or trust their relevance/popularity ordering. It is hard to compare recipes because ingredients are written differently in different orders. You have to compare recipes one at a time to see how they vary. I feel that often the recipes with many stars or votes actually have the same ingredients as some recipes that have no votes. Maybe the popular one just has a nice picture


**When I look for recipes I may be looking for different reasons:**

* Scenario 1. I am looking for a new recipe and I want to make the standard recipe is and not accidentally pick someone’s diet or custom variation. The result graph would let me see what which recipes fall in the main cluster and which are outliers.
* Scenario 2. I am tired of the standard recipe and I want something different. Then I would be interested in the outliers. 
* Scenario 3. I want to be creative with a recipe. I want to see what the current standard recipe is and I want to look at variations - see how other people have customized a given recipe. I may take components from different customizations and make my own version.


**What am I currently missing?**

* The killer method of showing the information. I know that there is some slick but very clear/easy to understand way to show this information
* Motivation. This has been working through the back of my head for several years.


**Development:**

* I am actually a software engineer myself. I could do most of this work myself. I would love to do the data collection
* **Data Source**: I would crawl the main recipe sites and parse the information into my database. I would absolutely keep links to the original sites and send users of the search engine back to these sites.
* I would include as much information as possible in the algorithm that relates recipes. Popularity/Ratings/# of Comments/Likes/Pins can be factored in to help recommend recipes within clusters. I would want to somehow balance those values between sites. How to compare 80 up votes on one site vs. 12 comments on another site?
* Parsing the recipes will be fun. There are many ways to say the same thing in recipes: '2 boiled eggs' vs. '2 eggs
* Equivalency: Determining the relationships between ingredients: sour cream and light sour cream are almost the same and score a higher equivalency than sour cream and cream cheese (slight relationship). How do you score whole eggs in one recipe and just egg whites in another?
* Seems that this system would help spot typos. Why does this one recipe call for 2 T. salt when the others ask for 2 t. salt?


**Notes::**

* Techniques/clear instructions/step by step photos can help differentiate recipes with the same ingredients. Cooks Illustrated recipes would not get the extra credit they deserve for their attention to technique.
* Once the recipes are fully parsed, and cost per serving (need average cost per ingredient info)
* One option would be to let the user filter by recipe source. They could pick AllRecipes and use this just compare the AllRecipes results. Ex. I just searched for Banana Bread on allrecipes.com and I got 274 results. What the heck do you do with 274 recipes? I want a better way to compare those results than their Relevance/Rating/Popularity.
* For my last birthday I went to several of the major recipe sites to look for chocolate cake recipes. The one I picked promised that it was very moist. It lied. :) I am not sure that my new recipe search system would have found me the perfect chocolate cake recipe but I think it would have helped me compare more recipes. (Please DO NOT link/post chocolate cake recipes.)
* I can cook but looking at recipes is more of a hobby. I love looking at Foodgawker and Tastespotting. A good picture can sell a recipe but I still want to know if there is something different/special about that specific recipe or if it is a beautiful presentation of a standard set of ingredients. I want to know if some food network star's recipe is actually the same ingredients as these 10 other recipes or if they have made some interesting twist.
* The once going
* Gojee is beautiful! I had not seen that site before. I will definitely check it out. It looks great for searching recipes across blogs and picking with my eyes/stomach. 
* I am not looking for the site to 'pick the best recipe'. The site does not know what I am looking for. I just want a different way for me to make the choice.



**TLDR: I want to build a better way to show the results for recipe searches.  274 results for banana bread?!?!**

One common theme among a lot of these it to marinate/season overnight, yellow mustard, cracked black pepper, salt, onion powder and garlic powder.  We then rolled the coated tenderloin in breadcrumbs.*  We've left it overnight with intentions of cooking it this evening.  I think the plan is to sear it on each side with some onions and garlic and then bake it at 400F for 15mins (it's not a large cut).

He won't eat anything he knows is a vegetable. It seems like it's much more of an 'on principle' thing, not even 60, has  type two diabetes. His brother had a stroke as teenager and is paraplegic. So, my boyfriend's crap nutrition scares me. His mottos, however, are food is better than no food, and 'how can eating food be bad for you?', if they have one'. He grew up with spaghetti/can of tomato soup as sauce, and a lot of yellow cake.

I am not an experienced cook but can handle most basic types of meals. Does anyone have any veggie concealing tips/recipes for me? For example...I was highly successful with a meatloaf with a lot of shredded carrot/onion inside. Shredding bell pepper into tomato sauce has worked. 

Please help me out, he'll eat things with veggies cooked around meat or whatever and will pick them out, if I am making something I like. No matter how finely I chop things, though, if they are visible, he will pick them out with a ton of determination. He comes from an area that eats like this, and his whole family eats with this kind of diet. I'm not a super health freak

Please help--I'm on parole for putting chia seeds in mashed potatoes last night (made them after having a few beers). I love my boyfriend, so give ideas. :)

Basically, I can't think of anything substantial. I don't want to have her worry about making anything, and I guess post surgery he's been left with a voracious appetite. I want something they'll all enjoy (and reheat) and that I can successfully pull off. So, any comfort food ideas that are a bit fancy pants but that their 12 year old will also (possibly) eat.

What you need
-Cast iron pan(everyone should have one
-salt
-garlic cloves
-butter

That's it

Turn your cast iron pan on high
Once the salt starts smoking throw your meat down, throw more salt down and flip it. Sear that for a little bit then turn heat down to medium.
As steak is cooking put butter on it
Flip steak a few times while reapplying butter.
When steak is near your liking, seriously, COVER the pan. Pull steak off onto your plate and scoop all that garlic goodness onto steak, you can dump butter also if you want, that's what I do.. its fucking awesome.

I serve with rice or mash potatoes

1370573831.0,1fu6lg,Home-made Malibu on a Monarch budget: A guide to macerating your own liquors for fun and profit.,Googunk,68,18,11,"This guide will cover the art of alcoholic maceration and infusion.  If you’ve ever looked at a costly bottle of flavored booze and said to yourself “what’s with these prices? Isn’t this all just vodka and sugar-water?”  Well I have some good news and some bad news for you.  The good news is you are a better sleuth than you think; these spirits are in fact grain alcohol

Well that is you no more.  Today you will grab your supplies and put together a home made liquor which rivals or dare I say bests anything you can find on the shelf.  You will be wealthier, something to flavor it with, two mason jars, 4 weeks of patience, sugar, water, and some coffee filters.  That’s it.  I’d bet you have most of those things in your pantry already.  We begin with the pieces:

**Liquor :**

The vast majority of liquor used in maceration (infusing flavors) is vodka and rum, but they have so much distinct flavor of their own that they seldom benefit from infusion.  Since the flavor added to the liquor will overshadow the subtleties of the base liquor, we will want to use a good liquor, but not a great one, it would be wasted in this application.  I usually just use Kirkland signature or Monarch.

For our example of homemade Malibu: I use Cruzan white rum.

**Proof/ABV:**
 
When it comes to proof, proof decreases as volume increases.  In any recipes I list here, 80 proof is fine, and probably within your budget.  Keep in mind that most flavored liquors or schnapps on the shelf are between 40 and 50 proof, and if you are attempting to mimic something in particular, you will likely end up close enough starting at 80 proof.  If you want your recipe to end at 80 proof you will need to counter your dilution of the alcohol and you can accomplish this by either adding everclear to compensate or simply starting with a 100-proof liquor, whichever may be more economical in your particular area.  Again

For our homemade Malibu: 80-proof is perfect

**Flavorant:**

I resist calling this “fruit” because you aren’t limited to fruit.  Anything with oil and/or sugar can be macerated in alcohol.  You just have to slice it thin.  I mean really thin.  In fact, as we want shavings so thin they’re translucent.  If you can’t see light through the membrane of the slice, it’s not thin enough.  The reason for this insistence on thinness is that we want to maximize surface area so the alcohol can extract the essence of the flavorant effectively.  We probably could just throw whole strawberries into the booze and get the same result if you waited for an entire year.  However, if you want this done in the 1 -4 week range, You’ll need the mandolin.  However, I know you well enough to know that you’re going to say “whatever, I can probably manage without the mandolin, you win

The best flavorants I’ve experimented with to agreeable results:  Ginger, coconut, strawberries, cherries, vanilla, instant coffee.

In most cases we next need to heat up the flavorant, just warm them so they’re more ready to part with their oils.

Many recipes will call for you to add the sugar as this stage and simmer the coconut in simple syrup instead of water.  I choose not to do this for two very good reasons:  1.The sugar will mix in just fine after the maceration process and 2. We will later be filtering this through paper coffee filters and sugar jams the filter.  I spent 3 days filtering my first batch because of this.  If you wait until after the filtration to add sugar

Our flavorant in the homemade Malibu obviously, it doesn’t go into the booze.

**MACERATION:**

Maceration refers to placing a product in a cold solution to incorporate the flavors from the product into the solution.  In our case the product is coconut, it’s difficult to “infuse” alcohol, because all of the alcohol evaporates off in the process.  Infusion of alcohol would require a pressure cooker and a lot more effort than I intend to put forth.

To start your maceration, and leave it for a few weeks.  The longer the better, but since the rate of flavor absorption slows over time, the sweet spot is 4 weeks.  Every couple of days, give the jar a shake to mix it up.  The mason jars you can find used at a thrift shop, but the lids are trickier, since they have a gasket on them you might have to buy those new.  Alternatively, you can use an old cleaned out spaghetti jar if you prefer.

**FULL RECIPE: COCONUT RUM**

1 small to medium coconut

1 750ml bottle white rum

(2) 1-quart mason jars or equivalent volume

Basket shape coffee filters

1 cup water

½ cup sugar

Remove meat from coconut, and then add coconut mixture in equal portion to mason jars.  Add white rum in equal portion to mason jars.  Close the jars and let sit in a dark place for at 1-4 weeks.  Longer is better.  Before bottling, taste the rum.  If more coconut flavor is desired, let sit longer and/or add ½ cup packaged shredded coconut.

Bottling day: 

Make simple syrup by stirring ½ cup water and ½ cup sugar over medium heat until dissolved.   Pour coconut mixture through a coffee filter which has been wetted with rum or vodka.  The best way is to drain the filtered product into another mason jar

Add simple syrup to the mixture and mix thoroughly.  Return coconut rum to original bottle using a funnel.  Since volume increased

Result will be milky and translucent, they aren't going to hurt.  This rum is now ready to drink immediately!

**Price comparison:**

In Seattle

Bottle of Malibu: $18.48

Batch of Googunk's homemade coconut rum: $13.26 (including coconut), and it tastes better.

Well look at that: it cost 29% less money, this homemade coconut rum is about half the price of Malibu.

**MORE RECIPES**

Here’s the best part: it’s the same basic recipe for a bunch of other macerated flavored liquors

Limoncello: Use peel of 6-8 lemons for your flavorant, clean desert liquor beloved across Italy.

Ginger schnapps (hehehehe): Use flavorant of 2 oz ginger, be prepared to babysit it.

Apple Pie Moonshine – Flavorant is reduced unfiltered apple cider, this one is pretty loose with measurements.  This will probably be 1 handle of everclear per 2 ½ gallons of reduced apple cider (that is to say, 5 gallons which have been reduced to 2 1/2 gallons).  Bottle into 1 quart mason jars with a cinnamon stick and let it sit for 2-3 months.  We’re dissolving a cinnamon stick here, so it takes time.  Make it in fall when fresh cider is cheap, and enjoy it come winter.  Why 3 gallons?  The ingredient quantities are nice even numbers and this recipe is just exactly the amount that lasts me, my wife, my gift list

Skittle bombs - Use two packs of skittles and 5 1/2-pint mason jars.  Segregate your skittle flavors (I know you do that already) into the separate jars.  Macerate in vodka for 1-2 weeks.  Shake up daily

Kahlua (My favorite): Skip straight to the simple syrup phase, but stored in the fridge and it will last about 3 months.

Oh, the liquor preserves the beans.  You now have a source of infinite real vanilla extract.  I’ve had the same bottle for years.

**A quick review of Dos and Don’ts**

**DO:**

- get a middle-shelf liquor

- Start with higher proof liquor or add everclear to end with a higher proof

- Thoroughly clean your mason jars to avoid contaminating flavors

- get a mandolin slicer if you plan to do this often

- save any sample size bottles so you can give this as gifts from now on.

- save the empty bottle during the maceration

- wet the coffee filters with vodka or your recipe's base liquor before filtering through them.

- test an idea with small batches before you make a whole bottle.  Mason jars do come in ½ pint

- In most cases


**DON’T:**

-	Use the coconut milk in the rum for malibu

-	Use an already flavored liquor

- Use cone shaped coffee filters

-	Use the really expensive stuff

-	Use a food processor to slice

-	Expect it to be perfectly crystal clear

-	Use bacon without directions

-	Use cheap or expired produce

-	Try to eat the post-maceration coconut

-	Add the sugar before the filtration

-	Spend way too much money for flavored liquor ever again",,t5_2qh56,1370649789.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/recipes/comments/1fu6lg/homemade_malibu_on_a_monarch_budget_a_guide_to/
