i've been a ""on again/off again"" user in /r/aquaponics for about two years now and I just figured I'd get back to you with some lessons

Here's some advice. Feel free to dispute this but I believe it has some merit - these are a few things that I believe I would have wanted before getting into it. NOTE: This is NOT to discourage anyone. Just stating experiences.

Advice: 

1. Ask yourself WHY you want to do this. I have two reasons why I need to start with this. First, it can be quite costly.  Regarding income - I suggest you take a look at seed to plant to harvest cycles for the plant you would want to grow - harvest seasons / off season plans need to be taken into account - year round costs for electricity, water, and failure (many, many, many failures). If you've done all this, consider your costs for investment and still turn out with a profit - go right ahead. Otherwise

2. Expect death - I'm sorry to say that in my two years of tinkering and experimenting - I've had some much death on my hands. I'm talking about fish

3. For those trying this out on a indoor setup / around places that have restricted space (like condos). ALWAYS make sure that you have a plan b for pipe failure / water failure / pump failure. I've pretty much had all kinds of catastrophes - i'll let you google them in detail but examples I've had are: a. Pump failure (due to power blackout) - tubing reversed after my reserve power was depleted and some of my tubes (didn't know this at the time) became siphons. Water started flowing back and flooded my floors. b. Exit valves should be bigger - after my pump failure

4. If you're starting out - make friends with your local pet store and plant shops. You'll be seeing them a lot. Use large sapplings for plants and goldfish at first. If you feel your system is stable - move on to more complicated tasks. currently

5. Low maintenance my ass! Don't believe this lie. It has a lot of maintenance involved but less backbreaking once you have good infrastructure and experience behind you. Things you will encounter that are quite difficult are: clay media cleaning - for old roots (i know i'm going to get flack for this). water inspections for ph levels (this things can get expensive over the years). pump / pipe replacement - this applies only if you're tinkering / fucking around with your system and experimenting. I can go deeper into this but i'll save this for another time. Nonetheless - it's still easier than the actual farming and you'll use less pesticides and if you're really cleaver - you can setup your system to have solutions for these problems. 

6. Addiction. It's like playing god. well if you're that type of person. It's hard at first


Life lessons:

1. This will teach you so much patience and diligence. It's fantastic because you have visible progress that's a live and you can benefit with (to eat that is). 

2. Don't trust every instructional video you see - these are upsell products for you to buy more shit from them. If anything - ask the /r/aquaponics gurus or read separate forums and pages. You'll learn more and it's good knowledge in carpentry and plumbing if you're gonna DIY this. I think I've earned about +3 skill points in both. Yes

3. Being resourceful and creative were the most useful tools - it's a double edged sword in a way. It can help cut so much costs if you figure out ways to balace the nitrogen cycle

Strange experiences:

1. Living in an agricultural country - I was laughed at for even trying this (like Noah). When my neighbors and even people heard that my system worked. They changed their minds and saw me as some kind of science guru. But I did get a threat saying that I shouldn't teach this to farmers or apply this in a commercial setting. Some people in my area just don't like change. 

2. Got approached by a dealer who was looking to grow some shit. He offered my a large sum to build (not teach) on top of the equipment and my time. I honestly got spooked and didn't take the deal when I learned there was an entire group eyeing my ""research"". Explained that it's just not cost effective (being in an agricultural country). Still believe I dodged that bullet.

For those curious: 

* system I used was flood drain system. Testing floating raft systems now. Looking to go back to flood drain after my experiment with seeds.
* successes were: basil, stevia, watermelon, chili pepper plants? and a few others I can't recall. 
* new experiments / challenges I'm working on: 1. using maximum of 1 25 watt waterpump only for 6 growbeds

If the rest of you guys have more experiences that perhaps I didn't include

A commercial CFL or HPS fixture takes up at least 6-8 inches which would be about a third of my available space...

I am looking at building an LED array from scratch to minimize vertical space. for about $70 you can get enough high power LEDs to give 6000 lumens (2000 lumens per sq foot) which should be plenty for simple greens.

The ones I am looking at are 4500k

Do any of you have experience with LEDs for growing in general? The commercial LED lights look extremely over priced which is why I am looking at soldering up my own. ( I know electronics quite well)

**UPDATE:**
I made a quick mock-up with the components that just came in. These guys are BRIGHT

Things are going great.  I have had. more success with the project so far than I was expecting.  In some cases the growth (edemame ? and the oregon sugar peas) is noticeable each day - the former growing up to 2 inches a day in a couple cases lately.  Some have reached the light.

I've added some new seeds around, but the rest - success!  Even the popcorn seed I grabbed off my shelf (several years old) has produced some shoots and roots in the case or 50% of the seed I tossed in the little seed greenhouse I have and forgotten about for 2 weeks); garlic that I planted has started rooting in a couple of cases, but not in others - so we'll see how that does.

I've added some mini gourds (a mix), more carrots that are now working (finger and mignon?), peppermint, and hops.  I managed to find some venus fly trap seed online, so I'll be trying that around the setup to see how they do (if at all).... and I'll have to figure out what to do with the other seed I'd ordered that should arrive this week (bonsai, some more pepper, and a couple others not coming to mind right now.

Bonus report: the automatic feeder I picked up for $20 (shipped) from dx.com has been working great so far.  Here's a video of it in action (along with my 4 quick-to notice me leaning over their tank to feed them goldfish):

I've had this going for about 3 months now. Hopefully the weather stays above freezing for a while. I've got about 10 spinach plants, and 1 victorian lettuce plants. I use a 35 gallon trash bin for my fish tank, with about 20 feeder goldfish. For the grow bed, I'm using a rubbermaid under the bed style tray (which leaks, will fix next season). The grow bed is on some old planks I found that are lifted on sawhorses. I'm using pea gravel for the growth medium. I am using a continuous-flow style system for the moment, next season I might try to get fancy and rig ebb and flow. The PVC system I set up gives me room to add 3 more grow beds for a total of 4. In the grow bed I'm using, it's getting a little crowded. I didn't expect the spinach to grow as big as it has, I probably spent &gt;$200. The most expensive piece was the water pump bringing the water to the grow bed, and lettuce will be ok as long as I keep the frost off of them. Let me know what you think

So here it goes.

The primary system:
Fish and shrimp in the tank

The secondary system: 
On top of the tank is a worm bin. Worms fall out of the bottom occasionally and get eaten by the fish (not primary goal though). On top of the worm bin are the rabbit cages. Rabbit manure is given to the worms in controlled quantities.

Also on top of the tank is a BSF larvae bin. Mature laevae self-harvest either directly or indirectly to the fish. On top of the larvae bin is the ""fly zone"" where BSF can mate and lay eggs again. The ""fly zone"" is heatet on demand with hot water pipes. On top of it all is the chicken coop. Chicken manure is given to the BSFL in controlled quantities.

That's about it. I think it could work. But probably there are tons of things I haven't thought about. Please let me know what you think.

As early as August, which puts it at about 13,500 gallons. This whole system will be constructed in southern China, by the way.


Now I've researched all of the following questions quite a bit already, please don't feel as though I'm merely handing the work off to you lovely folks at /r/aquaponics to do for me.  I'm just looking for a good dialogue where we can all bounce ideas back and forth.

I'll break down my questions by type:

**Greenhouse:** 

* Given it's dimensions (30' x 60'), that I may be wise to replicate? Any schematics or plans floating around?

* I'm also still trying to decide what an appropriate height would be

* Additionally, whether that be composting, rocket mass heating, biogas digesting, or some combination of natural energy sources.  Have any of you had success doing this on a large scale?

**Grow bed:**

* Given that the greenhouse itself is approximately 1800 square feet

* To appropriately filter the fish pond

* Is 1' a reasonable depth for a grow bed in a larger system?
For instance,221 gallons (compared to 13,500 in the fish pond).  This is less than 1:1, and therefore less than ideal.  On the other hand, I feel like anything much deeper than a foot would be approaching too deep. Any thoughts?

* Is there one predominant advantage to using the flood and drain method or the floating raft method in a larger system?  I anticipate utilizing each for their respective advantages


**Pond:** 

* At 13
* I should point out that this farm will be in China
* I don't anticipate needing a sump because of how large the pond is.  Does anyone disagree?
* The system will be built in Southern China near the mountains, etc. Does merely pumping water through the growbeds heat it enough to keep things warm in the pond, or will this cold water negatively impact my plants?
* Might there be a problem with the greenhouse being a little way away from the pond?  Obviously

Cost breakdown
*Tank - Free

*Frame - Free

*Growbeds - 2 for £15. also reusable if this doesn't work for some reason

*20mm Gravel - 200kg for ~£15. It was cheaper to buy 200kg than the 160 I needed. also reusable if the project fails

*Pump - ~£10 from ebay. A 1200lph powerhead.

*Aeration - Free

*Pipe and other fittings - ~£10

I still need to make a cover for it and I've got some wood kicking around from some dismantled shelves.

The low price was one of the main thing which enabled the project to pass the Wife test. I've planted some trailing tomatoes to cover the growbeds eventually and will plant some tallish plants in the planted to cover the tank.

1375126397.0,1jaoon,Rules of thumb for siphons.,tewls,21,1,8,"There are some simple to understand rules of thumb that should help you tinker with your siphon.  The first RoT is rather intuitive.  The larger the diameter of your drain pipe the higher the input flow of water must be to start the siphon.  We'll call it GPH (gallons per hour) since that is a common pump measurement unit. http://imgur.com/a/Jw4oJ#0

The less understood principle is that the further below your grow bed your drain pipe extends

The understanding behind the second principle isn't too hard to understand.  When water falls it gains momentum and therefore has more force.  In this case the force is going down and creating a vaccum above itself.  The further the water has to fall the more force it has and creates a stronger vaccum above itself.  The stronger the vaccum the more it will pull.  If it is pulling more than the water pump can provide it will start pulling in air.  If it pulls in enough air

Disclaimer:  I hate bell siphons.  They are cool

**TL;DR**  If your siphon won't start get a more powerful pump or a thinner drain pipe.  If your siphon won't stop (aka reaches equilibrium) get a longer drain pipe or cut down the input into your grow bed.  There are a ton of other little things you can do,False,self,t5_2rioe,False,,,t3_1jaoon

1367727712.0,1dpthw,The short (Okay not so short) but thorough guide to fishless cycling.,tewls,24,2,17,"What is fishless cycling?
-
Fishless cycling is the process of growing two types of bacteria in your aquaponics system.  Fish excrete waste which breaks down into ammonia

Why fishless cycle?
-
Because it's the fastest way to get these bacteria to grow and you won't be torturing little fishies that will probably die without the presence of these bacteria.  In a closed system ammonia and nitrites are toxic to fish even in small quantities

What will I need to have/buy?
-
- (Optional
- A water heater.
- A dechlorination method or product.
- Your *ponics system cycling.
- A pH up and down regulation product.
- Plenty of aeration.  Small systems should do fine with just a pump and the draining from the grow bed to the fish tank.  The more disolved oxygen the better though.
- *Pure* ammonia.  This can be a hard product to come by

Quickest way to fishless cycle.
-
**^A)** Keep your pH around 7.5.  Nitrosonomas seem to grow best in 8.0 pH and nitrobacters seem to prefer 7.3.

**^B)**  Buy a water heater and crank that puppy up!  Bacteria love them some 87°F water!

**^C)**  Make sure your water ain't toxic!  If your water has chlorine just let it cycle a few days through the pump and it will naturally degass.  If it has ~~chlorimate~~ chloramine then you need to buy something to dechlorinate your water (ascorbic acid works just fine).

**^C.5** (Optional)  Shake that media around in your water like a polaroid picture!  Those bacteria are on that media you stole from some poor childs aquarium and you gotta shake 'em off!  Shake it real good because you know what to do!  Then leave that media in your system for a few weeks.

**^D)** Now add ~5ppm ammonia.  Anything above 8ppm seems to stunt the growth

**^E)** It can be the case that you are missing some micronutrients the bacteria want.  Add a tiny tiny bit of fish food and this should cover their needs.  Specifically phospate seems to be the lacking ingredient.

**^F)** Make sure your pump is flowing or even better add some air stones or some high tech solutions like vortex aerators or venturi aerators.

Now what?
-
Test daily.  Keep your ammonia levels ~5ppm until you see nitrites show up.  Once they show up I recommend not adding anymore ammonia for a few days.  It takes nitrobacter longer to show up than nitrosonomas so once the *bacters start showing up you want to starve and kill a bit of your *sonomas in order to give your *bacters a chance to colonize and party

Then, because who cares about fish and plants.  We're growing bacteria.  That other crap is just a side product to what we grow.

I want to set up a small ""drain and flow"" AP system for my room. This means I am going to be using a very small fish tank (50l or ~13g). My growing-bed will be around the same size in width and length

The fish tank will be around 60x30x30 and my growing-bed I thought would be 60x30x20. 

This is the design I have come up with: [*sorry for poor quality picture*](http://imgur.com/EO76p)

I will have the fish tank below the growing-bed. I will build a stand for the growing bed. As in the sketch I am thinking of holding the growing-bed on it's corners or building rails for it to lay on. Will this work? Or will it be too heavy? 

For the drain

My questions:

- Will the ratio of water in the fish tank to growing-bed work? (50l in the fish tank and about 36l in the growing-bed)

- Which fish or rather how many am I able to put into a 50l tank?

- If I am only allowing the growing-bed 20cm as root space

Some of the main facts that I learned where:

* the system always needs abundant aeration
* the most power and maintenance intensive and failure prone part of any system is the pump

That gave me the idea that you could make a very reliable and low maintenance [airlift pump](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Airlift_pump) by simply adding a pipe to an aerator exit. ([here the somewhat more detailed German wikipedia with a nice graph on the operating parameters](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mammutpumpe)).

The main question then of course is
That of course needs experimentation and probably a few system adjustments like having smaller differences in top levels of the fish tank and the grow beds

But if it can be made to work

1. You remove the pump with mechanically moving parts and the high energy consumption
2. You doubly use the energy needed to aerate to also move the water around
3. Aerators usually are linear membrane pumps, silent and robust electric devices, with small enough power consumption to be run off grid

This is all theorizing of course, but in the same order of magnitude. That means if you blow 2000 l/h air into the system, it should be possible to move 1000 l/h water even in not so optimal setups.",,False,self,t5_2rioe,,http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/pwmkc/anyone_ever_tried_to_use_airlift_pumps_in_the/

2. SAND the inside of all the PVC tubes that I drilled holes in. (seriously bloody knuckles are the result)

3. Glue down the exterior protector tube.  I have had to clean out gravel twice now.

4. Make sure the gravel is higher than the waterline when full. It works ok but sometimes the syphon won't kick in when it should and the plant bases stay floating in crappy water.

5. LESS FISH.  I probably should  have only had about 20 tilapia max.  I think I have about 50. The pump tube gets clogged up due to all the crap in the tank

Since this is a closed loop system would this not concentrate in the system much faster? Would it also make the plants and fish unfit for consumption? What about other plumbing options like vitrified clay pipes?

-Probably some solar panels for electricity as well

 - Scooping in some mud from the bottom of a lake or creek every few days.

 -   Extracting usable forms of certain elements from household products and a little chemical ingenuity.

 -   Including compost tea in the water bank. Probably brewed from from a vermicomposter.

 - Pee in the water.

I don't have a system yet, I am constantly dreaming up that system in my head. I am curious, would it be advantageous to have a separate small tank with media and worms that could catch sump (for the worms to eat) and act as the biofilter? The tank set up I have in mind is Fish tank, biofilter/wormfarm/sump all in one, and grow bed. I figure it would be good to have the water nutrient rich before it enters the grow bed, as I know the grow bed is often the biofilter. This is for a smaller at home system, not commercial size.

I need your advice on what I think can be a great project! I volunteer for a Dutch non-profit which is currently building a vocational training center in Tanzania. I do fundraising and help with the build. 

Two weeks ago I found the 'back to the roots' kickstarter project of aquaponics and it sparked my interest in aquaponics. After a little more research I contacted the chairman of the non-profit and I introduced him to aquaponics
 
I want to know which type of aquaponic system fits best in this occasion. The plan is that I will build a test setup this summer and teach the students and staff of the school about aquaponics and their system. If it works as planned

info about the project:
* The school is located on the slopes of the Kilimanjaro

* The school is located about 200 miles south of the equator

* The school will have 600 students by 2017

* The ultimate goal of this project would be to feed the students and staff

* Since so close to the equator

* Labor cost is very very cheap

* We can make a investment

* Volcanic rock is in present (can be used as media?) 

* Electricity is very unreliable (every day has a few hours of no-electricity 

* Stream with melt water from the Kilimanjaro is on the edge of the plot (possible for harvesting energy?)

* Temperature is steady I think, see graph at: http://i.imgur.com/OE0yqjT.png

Questions: 

* What type of aquaponic system? Media bed, but just want to hear your advice!

* Is it better to have 1(or a few) large system

* What kind of fish is best suited? We were thinking of tilapia

* Are their things I haven't though off which might be a big influence? 

I really appreciate all help! When I will build the project I'll try to keep you updated with pictures. 

Thanks in advance!

p.s. A little more info about the non-profit for those wondering: http://projecttanzania.nl/english/ I'm sorry only that page is English

Water volume:
Half drum (100L) x 6 = 600 Litres
IBC top Grow bed = ~250 Litres

The fish tank would be ~700-750 litres.

Sump will be able to hold approximately 300 litres of water

1.	Picture http://backyardaquaponics.com/forum/download/file.php?id=18706

2.	Just replace the venturi piping with another pump in the fish tank

3.	So the idea is to have the fish tank pump the water to the grow beds. At the same time

4.	Aerating the water from the sump tank stream

Totes

1.	275 gal IBC totes

2.	1st for fish

3.	2nd for the 3rd and 4th grow beds.  Use the rest for possible fingerling tank.

4.	3rd for sump tank

Grow Beds

1.	Max 40 cubic feet of grow bed space

2.	40 cubic feet yields 300 gallons of bed

3.	4 grow beds from tote tops, 150 total).

4.	Cycle all of the 225 gal of water in fish tank per hour

Plumbing + Tech

1.	4 Bell siphons and their PVC materials.

2.	PVC pipe for plumbing ~100 feet + 30 joints for piping to fish tank and piping to grow beds.  It seems high but I want piping to go around perimeter of grow beds to evenly distribute water + sediment solids.

3.	2 Pumps at least 500 gph because of head height (one for fish tank and one for sump tank). With backups just in case of power failure.

4.	Aerator and water heating possibly necessary.

5.	Grow lights needed if indoors.

6.	Fishless cycling

Costs 

1.	Well each tote will be used not new so that cuts costs. They are about $150 each.

2.	The pumps are available around $70 each on amazon depending on which brand is chosen. Backup pumps are another 50 or so.

3.	PVC for the piping and bell siphons is probably around 100 bucks at home depot.

4.	The grow bed media will probably be 1/3 hydroton or other expanded material and 2/3 gravel to save some money. It’s probably around 250 for the hydroton and I don’t know about the gravel but it is cheaper by far in comparison.

5.	The construction costs depend on your situation and if you need to build some tables to elevate the beds.  I will need it so that’s additional lumber costs.

6.	A cycling kit for a system this size is around $50.

7.	In total that’s around $1400. Now you might need extra aeration but I feel like the 2 overflows pumping into the fish tank is enough aeration. You also might need heating if outdoors and it gets cold and if it is indoors you also need grow lights.

Plants

1.	The final costs are for all of the plants and fish. For 40lbs. of fish it could be up to a couple hundred depending on type and initial size. For tilapia its probably $100 for 60 fingerlings that will grow to ~1lb each in the end.

2.	Plants can be bought for a couple $ each as seedlings

3.	So every year it would cost ~2500 for the fish and plants.  Factor in electricity for pumps and grow lights (indoor system) at around 480 a year and the total is ~$3000.  Now a family of 4 uses around $300-400 per month for food, grains) outside of the system but 30% savings isn’t bad.

4.	For harvesting fish

5.	The plants grow at a much faster rate.  For example if I just did lettuce they take on average 24 days to grow

So does everything look ok

I'm wondering if any of you have resources (videos / lectures / notes) on the science behind it. I'm talking about the ratios and formulas of the volume, and length of the tubes and how it affects the push. 

I came across one youtube channel that showed the formula and considerations years ago but it seems that the video was taken down. 

I'd greatly appreciate your input.

For science

notsoevilhost

Edit: Additional notes and research I've come across.

1. Siphons in general are powered by gravity and not air pressure (based on Bernoulli's principle) - [Context - pdf page 2](http://eprints.qut.edu.au/31098/25/A_practical_example_of_a_siphon_at_work_eprint_%282%29.pdf)

2. Larger the siphon size the stronger the vacuum [context - forum thread - must test this IRL](http://www.backyardaquaponics.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=18&amp;t=12426)


Personal notes: 

* My interest has peaked in creating a stronger vacuum with the least amount of trouble. 
* I'm thinking about putting together a practical application test / video with data for this. If any of you want specific tests to be performed please let me know.

**Bell Siphon**

Taking some advice from a conversation I had with someone on Reddit

This search saved me about €20. I found a number of bell siphons built from old plastic bottles - right in line with my cheap-o system design policy! I don't take any credit for the designs

**Solids Filter**

The final part before I added the fish was a solids filter. The lava lock does seem to break up a little and constantly shed little bits

**Fish**

I picked up the boy from nursery and, all pretty small, a couple of snails (I've heard mixed reviews, but I think they might help deal with any algae that grows) and a couple of aquatic plants which I am hoping will act as a buffer until the lettuce get going.

I've started growing some lettuce indoors in soil, someday soon, there will be lettuce in the grow bed!

In order to create a complete closed-loop system

The growbed would be a wooden box, fat, stump would be placed in the center (maybe 1.5' - 2' diameter and 1' high) flat sides up/down to serve as a water flow buffer, promoting drainage in wet conditions and holding water when the bed is dry.  around the stump would be placed smaller rotting logs and sticks along with subsoil, the wood getting smaller and more rotted as you rise.  Gradually, the fill will fade from mostly wood to mostly soil, and the final foot of space would be filled with loose topsoil and a few inches of compost mixed in at the top.  The bed would be planted and mulched generously.

The drain pipe would drop into a fish tank (actually two little bookshelf aquarium tanks that I have, or pumped into a high point tank with a bell siphon that periodically flushes the plants.

Planting with buried wood is common in permaculture design as a way to increase water carrying capacity of the soil and provide plants nutrients as the wood rots.  A lot of people call it hugelkultur - http://www.richsoil.com/hugelkultur/

I wasn't worried at first, water temp was constant (more so than when they first arrived), and the water was far more clear than it was when they arrived.

I'd put them in about a week after getting through the ammonia spike portion of the cycling process.

As of today I've found a total of 8-9 dead (2 today on top, and I've ordered some lights for down at the bottom to help me see better and check things out.

I did a bit more research convinced it wasn't an ammonia spike (the one I had triggered my ammonia sensor to shift obviously, but pH has risen from 7.2 to 7.6 in a day, and all of the fish have, over the last 24 hours or so, shifted to swimming lazily around the top of the tank.  

I believe all this matches the ammonia-&gt;nitrite bacteria moving in and next phase after ammonia-spikage

I did replace about 15-20 gallons with fresh water to help lower ppm and pH, to my sump, and it's being pumped through the system now;  it was suggested on a few forums to aim for 1ppm sea salt which I hope I calculated right at ~1.5cups (~.7 lbs sea salt) in ~80-90 gallons system water.  It's supposed to help the fish cope with breathing in the nitrite rich water if I read things right.

I don't have a nitrite/nitrate test kit

Link to images: http://imgur.com/a/Rer3H

EDIT: the new even simpler design

This setup fits in a 4'x5'6"" floorspace.  It's designed to fit in my kitchen

Please ignore my 'emergency flood' trays under everything...I'm just paranoid of leaks - they're basically plywood bases, I'll have some matting underneath (80% recycled polypropylene fibres with gel foam backing) for additional protection against scuffing, minor unevenness and to further distribute the weight of the whole thing more evenly.

The top grow bed area is 4'x3'6""x12"".  I expect to have water filling that to ~10"" (where I hope my bell siphon will kick in), but ~50% of that space will be filled with grow media, so I'm estimating a transfer of ~30 gallons each cycle of the ebb/flow.  I did already purchase a pump that can handle an 8' head in case I add a 2nd grow bed above this one down the road.

The extra glass aquarium there is where I'll put cherry shrimp/cray fish as well

I will be trying to raise some cherry shrimp or crayfish througout the system as well.  I plan to involve them in the system wherever they'll fit will/survive for filtration/cleaning (they eat dead stuff - fish/worms-whatever too) as well as to use them as fish food (and sell/share with anyone I know who can use them

________

**The water flow

The lower blue tub is a 32 gallon container It is planned to be my sump/filter zone and depending on how water flow ends up

**Q. Should I put in any media in the base of this container?**  

**Q. Should my intake be at the top/middle/bottom of the tank if the tank is empty (or should that change if it has media in it)?**

The upper tub is the same size as the sump

1. I picked up (~60% off ), is more powerful than I need, but it is adjustable, and I've been led to understand that reducing the size of the outflow pipe won't harm the pump, and will allow me to further adjust the flow, though I'm more inclined to just add a diverter and get even more aeration somewhere in the system (probably right back into the fish tank?).  The rise of the pipe from the pump is 4', and the sum of the piping run from there is ~10', the pump I picked up can push through 650GPH or so (overkill)

**Q. Are pump bags recommended

**Q. If I'm calculating 4-6 flow cycles / hour (is that a reasonable number, reducing the 1"" outfeed pipe to 1/2"" piping, would reduce flow to ~1/4 of the original flow, which would bring me down to ~125-175GPH (depending on pump setting, real output, actual head in the end) which should work well. Is this correct?**

2. The water is pumped up ~4' and into that distribution system I setup.  I realize I could just have it end in one corner and go from there. I am thinking/hoping that this will let the water reach more areas of the bed with more ease

**Q. Will I see a benefit from this type of distribution?**

**Q. What are the pro's/con's of outflow release at different levels of the grow-bed?  At the top, but will it really 'flow' along the bottom layer and break up those anaerobic areas?**

3. The grow bed itself has two drains.  One is an emergency overflow drain; the other is a bell siphon.  I plan to make the emergency overflow drain out of 1"" PVC (with a screen over the grow-bed end to keep grow-media out)

**Q. For the bell siphon, and 'protective cage'.**

4. From the bell siphon (and the emergency overflow in worst case), but not jump out.  These will also reduce splashing. The fish tank has an overflow drain (height to be determined, but I'm thinking ~2/4 of the way up the container) which connects directly to the sump area. I was going to use 1"" PVC with some screens on each end (maybe endcaps w/ drilled holes)?.  I am considering adding an airstone or two to various areas of the system, just in case a bump fails, the fish/other critters will still get oxygen.

**Q. Is 2"" enough of a drop for aeration here

**Q. Should the overflow into the sump area be drawing water from the bottom/middle/top of the fish tank?** 

**Q. Do I even need to have this tank raised above the sump? If I put the overflow at the top of each barrel

5. The water from the fish tank overflow should end up back in the sump. Depending on the level I position my overflow at in the fish tank, rather than having the fish tank raised, is fine, I'll go that way and with the following plan (if not, I'll have to refigure and am open to suggestions - a 50 gallon tank is an option).

________

My plan for total water volume to make sure nothing floods

a. Start the system with the grow bed full of media to the 11.5"" level

b. turning on pump in sump/filter barrel, so the pump will always have 10 gallons of so of water in that  The fish tank will lower to 15-20 gallons (depending on overflow level).  

c. As the grow bed fills, which should equally quickly overflow back into the sump, (10 gallons remaining in the fish, 20 flowing into the sump). If the bell siphon fails, 1/2-1"" above it is the emergency overflow for the grow bed, so another 5 gallons may end up up-top, but it'll drain back to the fish tank, and the pump won't end up dry as there'll always be 5 gallons or so there.

**Q. Am I understanding/planning this right? Feedback is good - I'd sooner correct my faulty calculations/understanding now


**Q. *Another option for the aquarium use, with water hyacinth/water lettuce growing there (more food sources/awesome filtration), and let the water just overflow into the grow beds.  I could also, in this case, put a tower above for strawberries etc. which dripped straight into the filter/tank* Do you have any feedback about this idea? Any problems you could see arising?  I'd paint/cover the sides facing the window (the top 3-4"") to reduce algal growth.**

Through trolling the Craigslist free section

I can build the stands and growbeds myself

The plumbing shouldn't be an issue

My two main concerns cost-wise are the lighting and the grow bed liners.

Any tips on getting some lighting going for a reasonable cost? From looking at hydroponics suppliers, all that's left is fluorescent. Do I need anything special, or could I scrounge some used fixtures from somewhere?

I've got my containers

Currently

1. Pump in sump zone sens water up, and one branch leading back to fish tank; each line has a valve on it to adjust flow as necessary.

2. Tray 1 has an auto-bell siphon straight down to the fish tank 

3. Tray 2 has a bell siphon exiting the side of the tray at a right angle right into the fish tank.

4. Tray 3 (below tray 2) does the same as tray 2. This is the only tray not filled with media - it'll be a raft setup.

5. Tray 4 (bottom left tray) has an overflow into the fish tank just above the 'overflow' drain level from the fish tank back to the sump

6. overflow from fish tank (just below level of tray 4's exit) - this overflow will be via a larger diameter pipe (I was thinking 1.5""?) so that the fish will never risk overflowing. I think this will keep the fish tank at a fairly constant level

I'll start the system with the fish tank  sump full to the level of the shared overflow, and 3 and tray 4 full to the overflow level; if there's just over 30 gallons, at least, in the sump, that should allow me enough water to pump up, through, and have wash back into the fishtank then to the sump without the pump going dry etc.

note: I have mats under it all, I hope distribute the weight of the shelf unit and contents; there are also 3/4"" foam mats under the wood the barrels are on, again to distribute weight and provide some extra protection for the 100 year old wood floors in my old place.  I've kept things raised on the wood so moisture on the outside of containers isn't in contact with the floor or hidden and airflow can help keep things dry (short of floods).

Now...how would you do this instead? What's wrong with my setup - I'm sure there are several things.

I was planning on 1"" tubing leading up to the tanks (my pump is 1150 GPH w/ a head using 1"" pipe of ); I'm not sure if I need to go 1"" for the bell siphons or if 1/2"" is sufficient - and for these

Here's a blank shot for you to use if you're inclined to draw:  http://i.imgur.com/zf6qF.jpg ; just call the grey barrel the fish tank,2,3,4 counterclockwise from the one on the barrels.

Thanks again for the feedback - now that the containers I could get are here

I have a 3 IBC set up that I plan on expanding with at least another IBC cut in half for a total of 5 grow beds. Aside from that

We don't have the money to do a concrete slab but I figure we can strap the thing to the fish tanks for anchors. 

How big would you go? What materials would you use to keep costs down? I'm thinking wood/corrugated plastic will get the job done but I don't know how tall to make it. Would love to get a banana tree going. How much is too much/not enough ventilation? It would be in full sun for at least 10hrs a day if we placed it on the southwest part of the property. Probably around 5 hours of direct if we put it on the southeast side where the trees would block the morning sun. 

Are there any free plans out there for just basic rectangular green houses? We want to do chickens also so thinking about doing a coop off one side of the greenhouse. Is that a good/bad idea? 

can't really ask any more specific questions other than that because I don't know wtf I'm doing yet. So anywhere you could point me would be great. Thanks.

Well

1. I've hit the nitrite spike point I believe.  My ammonia is steady, I believe that the ammonia-&gt;nitrite bacteria have moved in, but the nitrite-&gt;nitrate (the good stuff) have not.  I'm down ~50% of my trout - but this may also have to do with my water temp.

2. Water temp: I have accepted that if I'm hitting 19-20.5 in the winter, but not an issue for me)?

3. I added a pump and some simple plumbing to my blue mini-recycling bin greenhouse and have it running ~12 hours a day (bottom 2-2.5"" filled with water all the time) with it entering the growbeds via my improvised 'strawberry tower', and inside the greenhouse (depending on water temp I set on an aquarium heater) from 24-28 after the lights come on.  It's not too humid in there yet...knock on wood :D

4. I redid my lettuce raft bin....I think it's 21 small baskets now, the top of the baskets are about 3"" closer to the lights at all times which is good.  Already the limp lettuce I had before is perking up and looking better (4-5 days?)

5. A few things were moved around on the window shelves, no other 'veg/fruit' stuff).

6. I'm passing the aerogrow thing on the fridge on to a friend who is very excited.  It's been working for some things (don't have the rockwool right into the water!)

7. I got some small 3v pumps (40cm head tops) for ~$6 shipped on ebay; I am trying them in a mason-jar-strawberry-tower setup (on one of the window shelves)

8. I also finished setting up a 'seed exchange' for my apartment which a couple people are already using.

I hope some of this is interesting to people beyond me. Feel free to ask any questions or provide feedback.

Siphons will be 1"" stand pipes using Affnan's designs.

Written by a beginner.

Basics

Aquaponics gets its name from and is a combination of two sciences. These sciences are aquaculture and hydroponics.

Hydroponic growing is the science of growing plants without soil. It is most commonly seen in three forms, or nutrient film technique (NFT). There are endless variations and many systems combine the different forms.

Aquaculture is the science of raising marine or freshwater animals in some sort of controlled environment. To understand how and why these sciences are merging to form the new specialization we call aquaponics we must first understand the major problems associated with these sciences.

In traditional hydroponics plants are grown in a nutrient solution manufactured to maximize the growth of that plant. This nutrient solution is traditionally made up of fertilizers that are manufactured from oil and high in salts. This makes them expensive and the salts that are not absorbed by the plants accumulate until they become phytotoxic. The response to this problem for traditional hydroponic growers is to drain and flush the system. If the system is a media based system

Aquaculture encounters a similar problem with waste accumulation becoming toxic to the system. Fish continually produce ammonia (and urea). It comes out of their gills when they breath, must be removed from the system. Aquaculturists employ elaborate filtration systems to minimize the amount of water used, however they cannot escape the need to drain waste heavy water from their system and replace it with clean water. Again, as in hydroponics, this waste must be disposed of responsibly. That means paying to have it removed.

So now that we understand the problems we can look at how combining the industries benefits each of them. Rather than waste and replace water

    Also, the older it is, the more well balanced and stable it will be. That stability is based on a complex ecosystem of life that includes not only the fish and the plants but also the bacteria that do the work of converting the ammonia, or fish waste, into nitrogen, our essential element to plant growth.

    If you are interested in more information about aquaponics, there is a lot of information out there. What I have found is that if you want to get to the bottom of something, you have to really ask the right questions and figure it out yourself. There is no substitute for actually building a system and trying to grow plants. Plant them, move them, eat them. Eat them some more. Eating them is awesome.  

Additional learning?
    The internet is obviously a great place to start. These are personal recommendations of mine based on personal experience.

http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics
http://www.aquaponicscommunity.com
http://www.aquaponics.net.au/

Youtube should get special mention. There are thousands of videos out there on every subject you can think of. I found Murray Hallam’s videos to be some of the best.


Want to read a real book?

1. http://www.amazon.com/Recirculating-Aquaculture-M-B-Timmons-Ebeling/dp/0971264627

2. http://www.amazon.com/Aquaponic-Gardening-Step-By-Step-Vegetables-Together/dp/086571701X

If you “look inside” on this book on amazon you can read most of the text for free.    

More of the hands on type? Build something! Nothing can substitute for doing it yourself. Find an aquaponic or hydroponic farm and get a job. Experience on a commercial farm will be beneficial in a variety of ways

Many people offer unpaid internships in places like Hawaii. I participated in one of these and would caution against them. Be sure you know what you are getting into before you go. There are a few that will actually pay interns

If you are really serious about aquaponics work somewhere or go to school. All the people doing research and the most successful people are scientists, and doctors. Use aquaponics as a tool to figure out what really interests and motivates you, and go to school for that. It will lead to bigger and better things!

except i havent cut a hole in the fish tank

1. once I get the clay balls washed and installed I will cycle the system for a few days

2. is there anything i can put at the bottom of the growbed, and would prefer to save as much money on clayballs as i can, as long as i dont need the full depth of the grow bed. (I know I could always make the stand pipe / bell valve shorter, but with the tank adaptor I got I cant make it too much shorter)

3. I cut the barrel approx 1/3 - 1/4 of the way down. and Im wondering how many fish I can keep safely. I believe I can add another growbed too allow more fish

4. What are the ideal timings for a bell valve/pump fill
-at the moment it takes about 5 mins to drain

5. I have a digital PH meter

1363501669.0,1agc6p,New at aquaponics,ZeusLightning,8,0,2,"Hey

I have been gardening for awhile

I know how the system is going to be designed


When starting cycling (Trying fishless first)
keep the ammonia levels at about .5 ppm until the nitrites get to about .5 ppm. Once that happens, then put in the fish and plants... does that sound correct?


Some other numbers that do not deal with cycling.

~6 gallons of water for one cubic feet of growing

~1 lb of fish per 7.5 gallons

~keep ph level 6-7

~rotate the amount of gallons you have in your system about 1 per hour

Any help or direction would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!",self,t5_2rioe,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/aquaponics/comments/1agc6p/new_at_aquaponics/

So

This seems to be one of the most straight-forward designs I've come across.  It doesn't look like it'll be too heavy for the apartment floor (not a HUGE concern

Any thoughts?  Ideally, so seating space is something I have to take into consideration.

I plan on moving within the next year as well.  This setup looks like it will travel well.

Any feedback would be great.  Also, I'm all ears.

What does your system look like? 
What is the smallest system you could use to raise some? 
Do/can you raise fish in the same tank? if so what type?
