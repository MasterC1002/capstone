So, and it was an amazing experience!  Not only did I do what I though was an awesome job, but I was the first person in my program to get a PhD (following a massive revamping).  All of the preparation, tears and stress were worth the 1 hour of presenting 5 years of research to my colleagues, and the additional time just talking science with my committee, and actually feeling like I belonged with them.  I don't know what else to say, other than, I made it, because you can.  Just keep going for it,

Mr. M told the class that the actual answer was at the Earth's core, and I corrected him, no

Most of the students reacted with ""Ohh, and how learning is something that happens every day. Then one little boy adds ""You were schooled *by a girl*!"" Both Mr. M and I turned to him, and at the same time as I said ""And what does that have to do with anything?"" Mr. M said ""Why does that matter? She knows more about this than I do.""

I was given 4 months to recover from major depression

_________________________________________
2011 was the year of the bastard for me-- personally, my best guy friend (for whom I may have some very strong feelings) in an insanely rough patch with his (now-ex) girlfriend and a time bomb goes off in my head. I unraveled a decade-old mystery about myself one evening, 8 days before Quals began. Serial sexual abuse when I was 4-8. Cue the PTSD. I sought a therapist immediately, but I was in no way ready to deal with this “THING”. I basically told to help me keep my shit together until May, so I could pass. She did so, and I’ve worked through a tremendous amount of very hard stuff since. This was not to be the only blow 2011 dealt me.  4 weeks later, my car was totaled. A week later, he’s getting along and now it is June. Time for things to calm down
Nope. 
Enter: my former advisor. The short version: He treats grad students like employees, intellectual drive, etc. was on me. I was expected to work on a timetable, however, that was appropriate for a well-vetted project. Sucks for me? Yeah. 
So, oral exam? “You could’ve done better.”) I get chewed out for not being productive. This hurts like hell. I haven’t told him what’s going on in the rest of my life, but he’s made it clear he wouldn’t care anyway. At this point, my anxiety is off the charts and (in hindsight) I’m starting to move into survival mode (read: my first major depression episode). 

Enter the final straw. In July, and comes over.  He has found a lump, a big one, in his liver. He’s just come from the doctor and a CT scan, which confirms its presence there. Holy fuck.  So. Away I go to home, and we’re in touch every day, but the waiting is awful. I return, he knows. But we hope it is benign. Hope it is just a surgery consult. 
NOPE. Cancer. Liver cancer. Again
So a surgery date is set. He and I and our 2 best friends are spending damn near every waking/non-working hour together.  
In lab, and why things don’t seem to work consistently. Weeks and weeks of helping my friend, his mother, being a source of support and strength.  He recovers. In October, he decides to move cross country, and because I love him and I want what is best for him, I basically pack him and shove his ass out of state.  It’s extremely painful and I crash hard when he’s gone. 10 months of insanity. Surely I can start working on myself
Enter November. I decide I need to go home for a few days. I coordinate a slightly longer trip so Besty and I overlap a day or two (he wants to meet my friends and family
Considering 1) my mediocrity as a student 2) my modest progress and 3) my inability to do things right, he’s been telling my committee I’m immature, lazy and not smart or dedicated enough for graduate work since JULY. So, he tells me he is calling a committee meeting in “the hope they can straighten you out.” I am devastated. I was just getting a grip on things being off. WAY off. I’m losing weight, not sleeping, can’t focus. Depression, right? Too bad it’s so tough to see when you’re way down in that hole.  So, I’m so anxious. 
They send me out of the room
They call me back in
They send me out again.
Unbeknownst to me, but he walked in there with the full intention of booting me. MY MENTOR. So, post getting my ass chewed by the committee, the room clears and I sit down on the floor and just come apart. Completely.  Crying, wanting to throw up, crying. I feel awful. Because it feels like no one has my back, I dont know what went wrong and in my head, or fixing anything and I should just quit. One of my committee members comes back (thank god) and she asks me some questions, I’m sick. The committee says I must do 3 things before the next meeting. BossMan decides this translates as 12. He draws up contractual guidelines, AND the committee never saw them. But that’s in the future. 

In the space of 2 weeks, now.
Boss Man is unimpressed. He complies publicly with my treatment because he is forced to. He won’t, I continue to fail. I’m throwing every shred of myself into not failing out and into getting healthy. My work is sub-par. But I show up every day, and I TRY. And then, I start to get traction. I have a happy couple of minutes. I stop answering “How are you” with a short “I’m still breathing”.  My advocate committee member acts as go between to me and my advisor, because he can’t or won’t believe that I won’t magically be better in 8 weeks. 

He refuses  to give me more help and oversight, telling him it’s a really bad day, it’s really bad week, please, please give me some help. Nope. He “can’t take the medical condition into account” when evaluating my progress. He clearly sees it as a character flaw. I’m working 60 hours a week because I’m terrified that I’m not working enough, or hard enough. Feedback? Negative to absent.  I get the 3 things the committee wanted done finished up. I start prepping for my first seminar. Below my radar, BM has already told my committee I’m failing to meet expectations
In the second week of May, then I go seek my Advocate.  I tell her what happened. She says she‘ll speak to him, and sends me outside to sit under a tree and calm down. I decide I have to get out of this guy’s lab. Post-haste. In fact, 4 months ago would have been great. I find out, in the aftermath, that the same day, he emailed my committee and told them that my data shouldn’t be trusted

BossMan calls and wants a meeting. We have a meeting. He fires me, get healthy, come back and finish a masters and then switch departments and do a PhD with a different mentor. I accept. I tell BossMan the plan, he calls a committee meeting (to which he brings another long list of my individual faults and failures). He’s already canceled my seminar. My committee is doesn’t want to see my data because he’s already told them I’ve failed).  They give the plan an OK, and suddenly, I have the summer off. He tells I’m just not cut out for this, my colleagues made it through fine, too. I felt broken

This is why I started this group and then almost immediately vanished. A huge thanks to Case_Protag for picking up in my place. Anyway

First off, what do you do and how do you like it? What does your field bring to your life that you think many women miss out on? And what would YOU like to see on this subreddit.

Let's figure out who we all are and what we're looking for so we can enjoy this subreddit to the fullest.

Firstly, and helpful. I have posted here before about PhD difficulties, and you were all immensely helpful. 

After a lot of soul-searching and discussion with my supervisor, and therapist, I have realised that academia is not for me and, ultimately, I am unlikely to be able to complete my PhD. Given this realization, it makes more sense to cut my losses early (I am just under 1 year in) and move on to a career that will be more rewarding. I absolutely love talking about science and explaining difficult concepts in fun &amp; simple ways, so I think my calling lies in scientific outreach/communication and public engagement.

To clarify

The other graduate student is a PhD candidate.  He is 25.  He entered the lab at the same time I became the technician

1329401970.0,psb2h,Physics PhD student with baby panic and lack of someone to talk to,troixetoiles,33,1,23,"Hey lady scientists!

Here's the tl;dr for the upcoming wall of text: Due to reading lots of articles about women in STEM

So lately I've been reading a lot of articles about women in STEM academic careers, I'm in my last year or so of getting my PhD, so I've been thinking a lot about where I will end up after graduating. (Honestly, I don't think becoming a physics professor at a research university is for me. I have more of a passion for education and outreach, so I would love to work at a small college or with younger students.)

Coupling these two facts has lead me to start having what I call ""baby panics."" I'm not talking ""baby craziers"" where I want to make a baby right here, or I've been considering doing an accelerated education masters aimed at people with a science background. And after I finish any of those, where ever I end up, I will be starting from the beginning again. So it seems like if I want to have a kid, I'm looking at several years down the line until I am at a stable postion (hopefully with health insurance) where I will be able to take leave to have a kid.

Now all of this worrying is about a hypothetical situation so far. I've talked to one post-doc from another field (one with more women) who had a good boss who was accommodating for her having a kid. But other than that, because it seems to reinforce the fact that having a family is incompatible with being a woman physicist.

Overall, I would rather have kids at a younger age so I would like to start thinking about having them in the next few years (I'm 26 right now). I don't know exactly what I'm asking for here. Maybe to just hear stories of how you did things or are planning to do things. Or maybe I'm over-thinking everything or being unrealistically pessimistic about having kids while being a post-doc or a teacher or a researcher. I just don't want to feel so mixed up and worried about this part of my life, because I know I want a family, but I don't want to feel like I'm throwing my life away to do so.",,False,,False,t3_psb2h

But I worry postdocs and other students think I am vain, shallow, or ""riding on my looks to get ahead.""

The guy I interviewed with is very brash with his words, where I talked to him about the things I felt I'd need to be comfortable living there, I mentioned that this girl had said that her salary was the same as my offer and that it was tight for her. I asked for travel support and work from home time, which he was fine with giving me, but then when we started talking about pay, he told me he'd have to ask his boss but it wasn't likely i'd see an increase. Ok, well at least I tried. We chat a bit more and he again mentions that he'll have to talk to the head of the department about pay

Skip to several hours later. 11pm, got a furious email from the head of the department bitching her out for talking to me and wants to talk to me on the phone. So we have a phone call. She asked what exactly I said, and so I reiterated ""I said that you let me know you had lived on that exact salary and that it was tight for a single person in this city"" Ok. That's all.

I got a call from my dad today, I tend to get compliments for coming up with solutions and for working hard! Personally, I also think that the working hard part has also given me a reasonably good (for a student) arsenal of ways to get things to work. If anything, I suffer from not sitting at the problem long enough to see solution, but that is something I remind myself to do, and it's immensely helpful to have friends and teammates who are willing to sit with me while I look for a solution.

But it was still distressing to hear that my mother thinks that I don't come up with nearly as many new things as my little (elementary-school-age) brother. 

I'm of two minds about what to do with this:

1) Maybe I'm really not creative enough and should try to do something else that I would enjoy

2) I also know that I feel a lot more comfortable and less afraid now than when I was younger. My parents hit me and yelled at me for ridiculous things (a representative incidence below). I spent freshman year in terror of adults, showing 'disrespect',' or forgetting something on a looong list of chores, etc. etc. meant that I was always happier at school than at home, and I'm much more at ease now. I'm actually surprised by what my mother said, because I have generally been praised (and cursed -- after the calculator-virus debacle) for creativity. I personally feel I do have a chance at research.

Story: For example, so idk) and my mother took the car window ice-scraper stick and repeatedly smashed the sharp end into my thigh. Thank god I was wearing jeans, so I only had a humongous bruise. But I tried to push her away, and she it my hand, so I have a half-inch scar between my fourth and fifth fingers. I was pretty distraught, because it hurt and I was a competitive pianist at the time, and super protective of my hands. Of course then my parents yell at me about how I deserved it for getting my hands in the way. I think that moment pretty much catalyzed my desire to work really, really far from home and then cut off my family for good. For those years, so I would often be without lunch money or sandwich materials. (Now-me wants to tell then-me to cook the food and acquire a lunchbox to stick it in. I knew how to cook and often cooked dinner. I don't know why I didn't think of that!) Luckily, I was underweight enough for my pediatrician to lecture me by senior year of high school.

 I'm worried I've made a huge mistake.  I'm in my second year of a PhD program

I had no experience getting myself into this, but I sort of thought the point was that you join a lab, and start off within the realm of an existing research program.  

I picked my advisor because his research is interesting, and I thought that was a good thing.  I guess that should have been a warning sign...

In an effort to make a boring story short, at some later point, he has become something quite lame, and quite uninterested in how science currently gets done.

So the fun thing is he started me on a question (vaguely) and decided I should extend the scope of a study that he published 2 years ago.  So I began to do that, but also with applying the methods and analyses to the newer question.  This has led to some understandable strife.

And I'm not being arrogant.  Everyone I have ever talked to about this paper has found the same problems.  My fix for all the problems is a different approach

And because I'm doing the current

So I just have to do everything on my own. I wasted a lot of time and energy doing the wrong thing with his approval


My problem is that I didn't know how this was supposed to work.  I thought something would have clicked by now, which would be fine if it was just my own bubble being burst.  However, I have to keep bursting his bubble, but it's basically his ego, and he won't let me.

If I say ""I need to do A,"" he says ""well we have a difference in opinion on that, but it's your project.""  I would gladly accept a reason for the difference in opinion, or a reason why I'm wrong, and any suggestions, but he offers no suggestions. I strongly suspect that the reason I'm wrong about what I need to do is because he got away with less so I shouldn't try to do any better.

I don't want to do shitty science, and she basically had to go about doing everything herself with no support from our advisor.  I think she's done great work, but I don't want to suffer for 4 years like she did.  

  I don't know how to go about switching labs.  I don't feel like I have anything to offer.  I know I'm smart


Has anyone here had to switch labs half way through a PhD?  I don't even know if I could just stop at a Masters because my project feels like it's nothing.  Or like it's something I've come to hate.  I mean

We didn't even make it, the PhD student we're working with did the master mix for us.

That way, we can operate off of the honor system - if someone reviews your work, you do them the kindness of reviewing their work. 

Some issues that might be related: the major one is privacy. A lot of these statements can be...well, maybe name and schools, etc if you publish your CV. I guess you would have the option of deleting that info and leaving placeholders. Otherwise, does anyone know about the potential of gleaning personal information just through Google docs?

I'm very lucky - my research professor is very involved despite being an incredibly busy man. He often sends me scholarships to apply for, share information and encourage me. Really it is a wonderful environment and I'm thriving in it.

But.. there are no women. There's one female phd in my lab and I've literally never seen her. I don't know what work she does, but their research must be very different from mine because I never see them (and I like to drift around being manual labour for other people's projects when I have extra time to spend so I feel like I ought to know them better). I haven't had a single female professor.. So all I see everyday are male doctorates and male students.

I'd love having a house husband or a wife if I could afford to support us both, but that seems statistically unlikely. Also, I am not a young woman - if I want children it's going to have to happen over the next ten years and if I go into academia, when would there ever be time for that? I can't imagine being pregnant and pouring concrete much less trying to raise a baby while handling the rigors of being a phd candidate.

So, healthy woman researchers out there? Do I get to have my cake and eat it too? Or do I have to choose between having a family and my research? I'm not unwilling to make that decision, I just need to know the realities of the situation and I don't know any female professors to talk to.

My research interests occupy that gray space that sits between ecology and evolution. Generally, and I often felt like I didn't fit into either dept very well. 

I was just on the verge of searching for phd opportunities when a fully funded one presented itself. It's very appealing, the direction of the research is much more applied than how I envisioned my dissertation would be. While applied ecology may be better for a professional career, I'm planning on pursuing academia.

1361023805.0,18myl3,"Torn between studying in the field of science and taking the ""easy way out""",kacianfa,17,5,22,"I'm not sure if this is the right subreddit to ask

I will start out with a warning that this post is a long read

I am 26 (27 in October) and I don't have any formal education. I am intelligent and capable but after high school I decided to take a few years off to figure out what I want to do before signing up for university. I started a series of great jobs and have been very fortunate to have landed an excellent job

Some brief information to backup how I decided my field of choice. In high school my favorite subjects were English, I audited some courses in business and decided it was not for me. I have always loved writing and English. I have always been a stickler for grammar and creativity but had never thought to look into studying English or linguistics. 

When I was 22, I learned neuroscience was something I really enjoyed learning about. I spent a huge amount of time planning my path - BSc in NESC, MCATS, Med school, residency.... I had the 15-year plan (or more depending on acceptance) planned out. I started to work toward it. 

Five years later and here I am. I have successfully completed 3/5 (working on number 4) of the university prep classes needed to apply for my BSc. There is a catch. I don't have family support for going back to school and I have a really good full-time job as the EA to the President. I was planning on doing the BSc part-time (I'm aware this will take forever) and then thought about incorporating my love of writing by taking a one year BJ (Bachelor of Journalism) at a local university offering one year BJ for students holding an undergraduate degree. Then I would make the final decision to do science (either med school or PhD) or something in writing/communications/public relations. I am aware that I am starting really late and it may not be feasible to expect that I'll make into med school. I would like to work in clinical neuroscience but would be happy doing some sort of technical writing maybe for medical journals. 

Here's where I am lost. The whole plan I constructed was based on working toward becoming a neurosurgeon but I am starting to seeing reality and understand that this plan may not be: (a) feasible for someone working full-time even at the undergrad level, if I chose the route of BA I could do it part-time much easier and quicker than a BSc and there is even a BA Eng degree available completely online. 

Part of me feels like if I don't do what I originally set out to do

If I do a BA, I could apply for a technical job at the hospital and work evenings so I can pursue med school or whatever I end up pursuing if I don't make it into med school. 

If I do a BA, this is a concern). Also with a degree in linguistics, I could get into neurolinguistics (with some specialized training) and be a speech therapist for patients who have suffered stroke, etc. this would be interesting to me. I'm worried that neurolinguistics is a hard field to be employed in and I want to make sure that I end up with a degree that matters, that can get me a job, that I can apply to a field of choice. 

I just don't know what to do and I am looking for insights into which field I should pursue (I recognize you can't really answer that for me but I'd like your input and thoughts). I enjoy the fields of English, psychology, neuroscience, and cognitive sciences. I know it seems like I don't know what I want, but I do, I just don't know where to aim now that reality has set in on my extremely ambitious 15-year plan. 

TL;DR: was originally planning to do a BSc in neuroscience and go into med school plus residency for neurosurgeon, etc.). I'm worried that neurolinguistics is a hard field to be employed in and I want to make sure that I end up with a degree that matters, that can get me a job, that I can apply to a field of choice. Need advice / insight.

I am a fourth year undergraduate physics student. I'm currently taking an Electromagnetic Fields course and so far I have understood very little

The other night I spent four hours trying to do a question on one of the assignments; I reread the notes over and over, and he refused to answer it and turned me away, saying ""just think about it"" and ""look at the notes"". This was very frustrating to hear after spending so long on the problem already. Even after I told him I had already attempted it, he still refused to help me. 

This isn't the first time this has happened. I had him last year for a class and it was the same situation. I ended up with a C in that course. Several times I went to him for help and I was either turned away or humiliated for my lack of understanding.

I've started to think I'm just stupid, and learn the material. I don't mind putting the time in, but when I don't get anywhere close to solving the problem after working for hours, it's frustrating.
 
My family and friends have suggested talking to an advisor about the prof, since I can't talk to him and the material is too advanced to find good information sources online (our assigned textbook doesn't cover the current topic either). I apologize if this isn't the right subreddit, I really like this community so that's why I posted here!

I’m not sure if I am accurately acknowledging my limits for the first time or just experiencing the so called “imposter syndrome”.  I took all my lower division coursework before transferring. I did well but certainly not great (B’s in every single math and physics course). Looking back on it I don’t know why I thought it would be ok to go ahead and major in physics when I got B’s in all of my classes even after giving it everything I’ve got. If I stick with physics I can’t see myself getting good grades or even passing the classes. When I’m in class or doing my homework I feel completely lost. I’ve started studying with classmates but they are on a different level than I am. I honestly have no idea how I got accepted into this school. 

The thought of 2 years (or a the rate I’m at now

Part of me says to go for physics, switch my major to something I both enjoy and can do well at so that I have options when I graduate. I’m not sure what to do, its so much pressure to do well and so much money to pay for tuition if I don’t get a scholarship next year. I’m quite a bit older than the average college student, I rearranged my whole life to come to school here and I don’t want it to be all for nothing.

Problem:  I feel like I'm at a crossroads in my research lab experience.  I am supposed to do some biostatistical analysis of blood serum data (hopefully will lead to a ""diagnostic"" through regression equations) but the only data I'm given is ""diseased"" and ""6 weeks after cure of the disease"".  As an underling in my lab, and I've complained to my direct superior and it fell on deaf ears.  

* Since I feel my work here has an expiration date/is useless

* Does an MA vs an MSc in Biostatistics matter?  I can't decide if I should write a thesis for my Master's program, which will lead to graduating with honors.  I know this is probably institution-specific, but should I dare to use one thesis for both degrees?  If it changes anything, I plan to go to medical school and later work as a physician-investigator, though not really as a physician-scientist (MD/PhD).

* Last fall, and eager mentor.  Although I would be doing less wet lab procedures (which I enjoy), he also said that a year or 2 of good work will lead to a publication.  How does a publication fit into the whole scheme of things?  Should I be focusing on this rather than a thesis?  Has anybody killed both birds with one stone?

* For anyone in/have completed grad school: I've taken a class (and had done well!) with the ""Graduate Program Advisor"" for MA/MSc in Biostatistics.  Is it weird if I ask her for a letter of recommendation?

For my gap year

My first gripe is that I feel excluded. It's an engineering lab, so it could be the har science/soft science feud. My professor even jokingly asked if I felt like a ""fail of an engineer"" even though I have strong design and quantitative analysis experience through my personal projects. Or it could be that I'm not as good at the joking/bragging banter. Or because I'm clearly not as strong (but I make up for it with the fine motor skills.) I personally feel that it's because I'm clearly uncomfortable with the racist and sexist jokes they make.

At the same time, I also inherited a project and lab chores when a lab member recently left, because I have very careful lab technique. One of the undergrads felt overworked, so I got another finicky project. The postdoc is deliberately unhelpful to students sent over by collaborators, so they keep bugging me with emergencies they could have avoided with some common sense, so I've started being unhelpful too. I'm already spending 14+ hours a day and coming in on weekends. And the prof just promised my labor to another lab on one of their projects. I talked to him about the te crunch, and he just says I should be able to handle it. I'm at my wit's end!

Btw, I'm also applying to grad programs that would look askance at bailing out of this lab.

**tl;dr 25-year-old lady with BA in the arts wants to go back to school for Astronomy

a little background: I am 25, see what people are researching on, and feel very melancholy every time I walk through the main science complex. During college, I didn't think too hard or spend a lot of time being introspective about what I wanted to do. Theatre was great at the time, but now that I am older I've of course changed a lot. 


The field I am interested in is astrophysics, it's been easy to be discouraged. It seems like a highly competitive field with a very small number of positions available. I'm also getting a sense from some posts here that academia can be very frustrating in terms of the type of people who work in it, experiences with sexism, the way money is handled and so on.


However, and when you find the one that you can't imagine not being a part of your life, that makes you tear up and your heart beat faster, that it is what you really want. Of course, that's a very romantic piece of imagery and I'm sure not everyone's path to finding what they want to do in life is the same, but that sort of did happen to me very recently after chatting with a faculty member in the Physics department who is part of the team observing on CanariCam. 


I had a long talk with my boyfriend (who is lovely and supports me) about how I was feeling--stressed out, which is great because I have always been terrible at knowing what I want to be doing in 5 years (read: I never have). I love where I work now, and I love making money and being able to save a lot, but when I think about trying to advance and learn more in IT I can't really get that excited about it, and the notion of continuing in IT makes me very depressed and doubt my ability to succeed anyway, since I have no IT schooling or experience beyond help desk.


In terms of the logistics, and the horror stories about paying back loans… ugh! I've saved up a good chunk of change, especially compared to most people my age, but it's only enough to pay for maybe a year or two of undergrad tuition at in-state rates. I'm also a bit worried about my parents, who are in their early 60s. While they are still independent and more or less healthy, I can tell they are aging and I worry what will happen in the next 20 years, since I am an only child and we only have one other family member in this state and she is just as old and in worse health.


So I go back and forth, at this point, the idea of being university faculty--in fact I would prefer to stay away from the private sector/industry and feel like I would be most interested in research.)

Pros:
-one time presentation.

-you get to choose what to say; the information provided doesn't depend on the audience's interest/ability/desire to formulate questions

-I feel I excel at these. 

Cons: 
-you compete for attention. If your presentation isn't the most exciting in that time period

-These take a lot more prep work.

Poster: 
Pros:
-you get a lot more traffic and because of this

-possibly more network opportunities

Cons:
-you have to hope that people are interested while you awkwardly stand there waiting for questions. I compare it to waiting to be picked for a team in gym class. They give you a good look over and either pass by

-you have to give essentially the same presentation as many times as people are interested in an hour or two.

-you don't get to see other people's posters and network with them.

My first year in grad school in a biology program, and I really didn't do much else. I was often in lab till 11 or midnight. And I worked myself into some serious repetitive stress injuries. Which really snowballed, partly because I kept working, but in my defense, the doctors totally misdiagnosed me and didn't take my complaint seriously, so I didn't understand how serious it was.

I've ended up taking the last year off to deal with the tendon and nerve issues in my arms. The first semester I took off unofficially, well-funded, fast-paced, mostly postdocs. So it was pretty horrifying to try to start and realize that I just couldn't do it physically.

After tons of physical therapy and a couple surgeries, I'm an author on five publications (two in Nature), and I have an NSF fellowship. But I just felt behind everyone else because I've never properly learned chemistry, or taken a biochem class, etc.

And my advisor doesn't want me to take classes. He wants me in lab

So my injuries have just compounded this anxiety to the point that I panic when I set foot on campus. Let alone when I go into my building to talk to someone about something. I don't know what to do. I love the work they're doing in the lab, and my physical limitations. Even when I'm recovered, I'm going to be at risk for developing these problems again. I can never go back to just working 12 hours a day. I have to be careful and smart and respect my physical limitations. How do I do that in such a fast-paced environment? How do I do that without feeling inadequate?

Lately I've been wondering if I should transfer to a lower tier school. I got courted pretty heavily by a couple good but not top-tier schools (UW, and I wonder if, given my limitations, it would make sense to be somewhere a little less demanding, and a little more willing to accommodate me because I'd be a bigger fish in a smaller pond in the settings.

On the one hand, leaving the lab that I fantasized about joining as an undergrad and as a tech before grad school. But I don't know if I can do this. When I started grad school, my attitude was that even though I was missing some coursework, it would be okay because I was willing to work as hard as I needed to to make up for my deficits. But I just can't do that anymore. Everything about this year has been showing me what I can't do, which has ranged from not being able to cook, to not being able to shower without assistance after surgery, to not being able to tie my shoes for weeks.

Like many of you, I dreamed of combining hard science with aesthetics and design. At school, I kept my options open and picked both science and liberal arts subjects. The plan was to get as much scientific training as I could and then...? I enrolled in a Biochemistry BSc degree that offered a humanities component and graduated at the top of my class. By this time, the research bug had bitten me and I was accepted onto a PhD programme. This is where my little plan started to break down.

I suffered a nervous breakdown near the end of my PhD and took an intermission. It coincided nicely with the doom and gloom of the global financial meltdown. In that space, wrote my thesis, aced my viva and graduated. By this time I had secured an internship and my alternative career took off. That was nearly three years ago.

My PhD supervisor has since left academia, I feel glad that I got out when I did. I am earning the same (or more) than I would be as a postdoc. I have flexible working conditions. My current career is not tied to a particular geographic location or a particular person or field.

However, I can now envisage leading and driving projects and teams. I can also see that it might be easier to do what I ultimately want to do (still chasing that childhood dream of combining hard science with aesthetics and design somehow) from *within* the scientific sphere. I feel like I am standing at a crossroads. On one hand, I could aggressively pursue my new career and hope that leads me to where I want to be. Or I can try to get back into science with the same hope.

I run a small national non-profit that focuses on space STEM education. We are located in the DC area. This April we spent $2500 of our hard earned cash (and about 4% of our annual budget) to participate in a huge science and engineering festival held here. The festival encourages participating organizations to connect their members and audiences to the organization web and Facebook page. 

Of late, but I think it has an element of truth. We get what we celebrate and we don't celebrate science and engineering. What do you think? Be civil."" This was in reference to a photo juxtaposing major scientists with a celebrity, with the tagline ""If you don't know who these people are, but you know who this is, congrats. You're what's wrong with the world."" 

A huge part of my E/PO efforts over the last 13 years has been encouraging my fellow engineers and scientists to be more approachable, thanking him for the awesome festival, and ending on a hopeful note that the organization might be a little more considerate of their impact in the future. He responded by calling into question the legitimacy of my opinion since I was not an actual sponsor, but paid the minimum fee to participate. I thanked him again, reiterated my points, and was resigning myself to no response. 

This morning my FB feed presented me with a giant image of Dr. Brian Cox saying

Now, and a vulgar description of female genitalia / sexist term for idiot probably wouldn't cause me to blanche. However, as CEO of my non-profit, I cannot associate my group with an organization supposedly for children that reposts content of that nature.

I sent the Director another polite email letting him know I had informed my board we couldn't participate in their festival in good conscience anymore and wished him the best.

He responded with a series of emails informing me he was going to write letters to all the members of my board telling them  ""you basically are trying to  silence our freedom of speech."" 

The next email

I have responded, public apology, or anything that required any admission of wrong-doing on the organization's part, or threaten to publicize the argument or write his board of directors. I just was trying to help someone in a position to do a great deal of good how he could make his cause much more successful, and when he continued to undermine my organization's methods, I broke ties.

1. Am I overreacting about the posted FB content in reference to a K-12 audience? As it stands, I'm willing to take that into consideration.

2. Any suggestions where I can find large international science/engineering festivals that are a little more open to educational priorities and encouraging communication?

1337135883.0,tpbem,Ladies of genetics: Anyone work with rats?,f0rmaldehyde,12,2,3,"Technically my area is Astrophysics and genetics is a hobby of mine. I have however found something quite interesting and I could really do with any input anyone more qualified than myself in the area could offer.

Recently I found a gene in our rats that appears to disrupt the correct distribution of dilution genes. Specifically it would appear to effect the pink eyed dilution. Two initial crosses were done. One male showing the trait was crossed to his litter-mate who was also showing the trait

Much to our surprise not only did the condition pass on and show phenotypically in both litters

In my country megacolon does not exist as a result of pigment distribution as these animals are not allowed into the country. Even our high whites do not suffer from it like they do overseas. So this was very curious. 

Not only does the gene cause two colours to be present on the animal (diluted and non diluted

Necropsies were done on all offspring suffering from megacolon after all other environmental factors for the problem were ruled out. 

So Im at the end of my understanding as far as the way in which dilutions work

I have not yet ruled out that the megacolon is a once off anomaly caused by the particular male or whether it is directly connected to the problem gene. I do not know if this gene is separate entirely

When we crossed the animals to those who did NOT have any dilution genes present the colour discrepancy was not visible on the coat

Has anything like this ever been seen before in labs? I was going to talk to someone in the bio dept at our university but I wasnt sure who to talk to or if anyone would be familiar enough with these animals specifically to add any insight. To be honest Ive never had much to do with that department. Might be a long shot

Heres some cute pictures showing the colour discrepancy.

I'm a current sophomore at a small liberal arts college. Right now I'm a declared psych major, especially neuroscience. Several users also said that there's no way to get into a neuro grad program with a psych background. It is still possible for me to switch majors to bio with a minor in neuroscience at this point in my college career, but it would be a pain in the ass. I'd be willing to do it if it would help me make the cut for grad school, though.

Hearing things like this is a bit distressing to me, and they all assured me the psych background would be fine for grad programs in neuroscience, even if I was aiming for the more biological (or even computational) end of neuroscience. It's hard for me to reconcile what they say with what I read online though. How do I know who to believe? What if things have really changed that much since they were applying to/attending grad school and they're unintentionally giving me bad advice?

I realized too late in my academic career that they were all wrong, and that an undergraduate degree in math is not very useful unless I combine it with something like programming or finance.  Unless I want to spend a couple more years (and a lot more money) to learn these things, my math degree is useless.

TL;DR - PI is trying to convince me to quit grad school. I have never been so sure that I want to, and I'm scared.

Long story short

I am a third year PhD candidate. My main issue is with the PI. He basically thinks that I picked the wrong career, he is a lousy mentor - there is very little intellectual direction given, moreover I am on an ""orphan"" project so that I don't even have others to consult in the lab. I agree that yes, some people in the lab are able to function like postdocs, and admittedly I am not at that level yet. I'm definitely not the star student and I do not pretend to be, either. But... Aren't I here to learn this stuff?!

There is a long backstory of conflict here, but who knows... Now, I already passed the quals. Can they kick me out of the program if he insists that I am unfit? His reasoning is anecdotal and far-fetched at best. e.g. He asked me what I like to read on a saturday night, and I answered current affairs. I love my NPR. Well. He told me that just for that answer, I should not go on any further. That if i were meant to do this, science literature relating to my topic is all I should ever want to read. Of course I read other interesting news articles besides journal articles. Does that mean that I am not tickled by science news, or that I don't like to read the literature, and as the only student in the lab without funding

To be honest, considering the postdoc job market, the smartest thing to do probably WAS to quit. But I carried on,fought hard, and passed. Moreover, I had a very tough committee and I am quite sure that they would have failed me if they saw that I was totally unsuited for grad school as my current boss seems to think so.

I should have done this right after passing my quals

Last time he gave me this talk, maybe I really don't belong here. However, after spending another year in the trenches, I'm more sure than ever that I do belong here and can do great things, if trained to my full potential. I am just hoping that it is not too late to try to find a mentor who can do just that... 

Sorry about ranting... I just need some words of courage from you guys. I will fight with him, long, long years, but I will not give up my destiny because I don't fit someone else's unrealistic idea of what a perfect student should be. Of course, it was my fault that I chose the wrong lave and the wrong PI, but things looked a whole lot different when I first joined.",,,,

I graduated like 3 years ago with a Masters in Biotechnology in the UK and I pretty much worked since then till about a month ago.

I have been considering going for another Masters for a while now and I am leaning towards Drug design and development since alot of the jobs out there are mainly clinical research associate positions. But then it feels like doing a PhD would make more sense since I have had some good hands on experience and that would be  the expected path for someone interested in academia (Me!)
Now finding a PhD studentship that will fully fund me is next to impossible but doing a one year MSc or even an MPhil seems financially doable.
