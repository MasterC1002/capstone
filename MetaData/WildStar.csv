[[Suggestion to Carbine] Give WildStar Redditors keys - WildStar Subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1ezwkv/suggestion_to_carbine_give_wildstar_redditors_keys/)

The OP expressed his desire for Carbine to give loyal followers here @ Reddit keys

I don't agree with the notion that we ""deserve"" keys more than anyone else

That's when I realized that if we wanted to be recognized by Carbine

Here's what I came up with (I came up with the tag ""WSSR"" which resembles ""USSR""

[BETA APP GUILD INFO](http://i.imgur.com/fvgDWpa.png)

Entire the info in the image above in your beta app when you submit it (you can revise your earlier app by using the same info you used before I believe). That will group us all together in their system and will make it much easier for them to target us in the future.

Let me know your thoughts on the subject. Anything that increases our chances of getting beta invites is a good thing in my book. :)

Here's the info in text for those too lazy to type :p lol (thanks to UltimateNoodle for reminding me).

**Combat**    
   
- There is the possibility for tab targetting for less skilled players BUT they will never be as effective as a free form targetting.
- Tab targetting does NOT guaruntee the ability will hit the targetted player.  Tab targetting essentially aims you at the target
- Telegraphs can be any shape and size.  You can even have inverse telegraphs.
- The combat system is not based entirely on telegraphs
- You cannot cast mid-jump for most spells
- Abilities are usually resource based/restricted(mana) but are sometimes cooldown based
- **THERE IS NO AUTO-ATTACK**
- There is a ""basic-attack"" mapped to right-click.  This basic attack does trigger the global cooldown
- Some classes have up to 90% telegraphed abilities.  Some closer to 50%
- To avoid overwhelming raids
- Beyond telegraphs
- Listening to player feedback to get rid of standard rotations
- Trying to avoid ""number inflation"" to keep damage numbers low
- GCD duration (observed from demo) -- ~1.5s (give or take my reaction speed borking it up)

**Shields**    

- Health does not regenerate while in combat
- Tech Shields regenerate a set amount of time after you are last hit (even if still in combat)
- There are abilities which specifically target and heal tech shields
- There are abilities which ignore tech shields
- There are also absorption shields which are ""treated differently"" than tech shields.  Said ""magical"" so I'm guessing they are cast by a spell/healer class.
- Tech Shields are itemized.  You will pick up better tech shields as you play.


**CC**    

- No current diminishing return on CC
- **CC's are more powerful in PvE than in PvP.**  Because of the ""breakout system"" they can weaken/strengthen CC in PvP without effecting PvE
- Always give a player a goal or activity when they are in a form of CC to help them escape (retrieving a sword that was knocked out of the player's hand
- *Interrupt Armor* is something that can be cast or applied to you.  For example if you want to cast a channeled spell you could cast Interrupt Armor on yourself first.  
- You can apply *interrupt armor* on teammates
- *Interrupt Armor* can prevent ALL *hard* forms of CC(implied not things like slows).  The Interrupt Armor is a bar that can decrement down to zero and then you are able to be CC'd.
- **Telegraph time for abilities are tuned to NEVER be lower than standard latency** meaning you should always have the chance to dodge...  assuming no delay in reaction time such as 0 people in the world.

**Classess**    

- *Perhaps* a bow and arrow class.  Little bit of laughter
- One of the unannounced classes can spec healing
- No healer is definitively better than another.  Any benefits of one over another is purely situational.
- Stalkers will be less likely to actually be hit when tanking.  They are experimenting with giving them a higher chance to ""evade"" autoattacks.
- ""Might have pets.  Might not have pets.  This is redacted""  When asked about a pet class
- Definitely strong trinity system (unlike GW2)
- Currently swapping specs is easy.  Player feedback is making them second-guess this.

 **Tanks/Heals**    
 
- Tanks and healers still have to worry about positioning and aiming
- Dedicated tanks will have a role in PvP
- Tank taunts reduce damage of player that has been taunted unless the taunted player is attacking the tank
- Tanks are great for holding/assaulting objectives in PvP
- Tanks are useful in arenas because they rarely die
- Tanks have strong support abilities to further their usefulness in PvP.
- One specific tank ability allows him to form a bubble and all allies in the bubble take reduced damage
- Healers will not be able to heal indefinitely
- Healers will add significant survivability in PvP
- Hybrid builds are possible.  Devs liked to go mostly DPS with a few ""pocket heals"" on their ability slots for Arenas
- Some healing classes are substantially more dependant on telegraphs than others

**Abilities**    

- Mobility differs between classes.  Some classes will have no channels.  Some abilities simply slow a character while casting.
- It is possible to adjust your ability set such that you will have no channels/slows while casting
- Abilities on bar should be active -- not buffs.  Trying to avoid having abilities with long durations.
- WildStar is programmed to allow people to use shields and life as resources (like mana) but they are not currently doing so.  It ""may or may not"" happen.
- Potential class ability that lets you swap places with a target.  They are ""trying out"" the ability to see its implications.

**Beta**    

- Stress test is likely to suck for players
- Trying to ramp up amount of beta players quickly
- Current beta players are not having their beta names reserved.  Reserved names during beta will likely only happen very soon before release
- New waves of beta invites will be coming out every couple of weeks

**PvP**

- **Currently they are NOT showing telegraphs to players in PvP(!!!!)**.  It will benefit you to know what the telegraph for another class' abilities looks like.  This is still subject to change.
- Can level up character in PvP
- Paths will unlock abilities for use in PvP (arenas
- XP/time ratio of PvP should be roughly the same as PvE.  Want you to be able to level up with just PvP.
- PvP currency is present.  Can be used to buy and repair stuff(Warplots)
- There are randomized chances to win loot
- It's possible for a really skilled player to win a 1v3
- Will have a ""tutorial experience""
- eSports a possibility if the community wants it -- Arenas and Warplots.
- In PvP classes take a rock-paper-scissors approach to countering each other based on ability skillset chosen
- PvP is more strategy focused than burst focused.  Currently averages 20s to kill 1v1 assuming no dodging and toe-to-toe.  Still VERY much in flux.
- No plans to allow custom matches where players can set parameters
- Using the same plug-in systems used in housing the devs can add randomized and new content to existing battlegrounds to keep play from getting stale.  This probably won't be done until post-launch.

**Dueling**    

- Very likely.  Lead PvP designer mentioned it as one of the systems she is involved in

**Crafting**    

- Circuitboard system

**Paths**    

- Devs are being careful with path abilities.  **DO NOT want you to feel it's advantageous to re-roll the same char with a different path simply because the abilities may be better.**

**Gear**    

- Raids may have the best loot but not all good gear for PvP will be locked behind top tier raids
- They are working on balance such that players can gradually build up their PvP gear
- Gear will give a definite advantage in PvP
- PvP gear progression scheme where good gear is from battlegrounds
- Warplot gear will give you a decided advantage in arenas
- **Stats on gear will have diminishing returns!**
- Everytime there is a new tier of PvE gear released
- There are two PvP specific stats for gear
- PvP Offense increases damage against player targets
- PvP Defense mitigates damage from other players
- Will near definitely have an equipment ""loadout"" system where you can switch gear sets quickly.
- Assault power helps DPS
- Support power helps healing
- Damage bonuses on gear will be generic +dmg...  not anything like +fire dmg


**API**    

- **Addons mods will be coded in LUA**
- API is still in flux but is very robust.  ""Anything [Carbine] can do with the UI
- **Code for the Carbine UI is provided so people can mess with it**
- Macros will likely be allowed
- Existing add-ons include a player-made chat mod which allows a player to receive whispers which show up in a window

**Battlegrounds**    

- Two different types sizes of battlegrounds 10v10(10-15 minutes
- Unranked battlegrounds are not matchmade by skill or gear level
- You will have an ELO rating for your skill in ranked battlegrounds.  You will be matched with people of similar skill level
- Rallying system boosts everyone to top level character for battleground in stats
- No persistent battlegrounds that last for days on end (like Alterac Valley) and they have zero interest in making one
- Capture the flag is a current BG type
- Next BG rollout to beta will be an attack/defense like TF2 carts and SWTOR Void Star with ""their own little twists""
- Currently prototyping a domination-style (capture-hold) with an interesting addition at the end
- PuG's and premades are possible
- You can have premade groups in battlegrounds

**World PvP**  
  
- PvE server players can flag themselves as PvP
- **Not any major objectives to do in world PvP ""yet""**
- Open world PvP has no level restrictions (and the planned PvP population plummets ;) ).  High level players will not get experience for killing low level players
- Implied you get XP AND PvP currency for open-world kills
- There are diminishing returns for killing the same player
- On PvP servers you are safe in zones controlled by your faction.  If you go into a shared zone or an enemy zone

**Arena PvP**    

- Current sizes are 2v2
- Arena is not a standard elimination match.  They have ""team respawn lives"" -- each team can have 6 lives and when you die you use up a life
- Potential to have game-types
- Arena is capped at 30 minutes

**Warplots**    

- **Damage taken to warplots is persistent.  You will have to repair/rebuild/maintain after battles!**
- Paths will have influence on Warplot play
- Warplots is intended *for large raids* (MAX is 40v40
- Presumably more info to come as a dev said she is limited in what she can currently say.  Dev seems very excited for the information that is not yet released
- Warplot PvP expected to last closer to 45-60 minutes

**Housing**    

- Players cannot attack/steal items from another player's house
- There will be ways for you to ""interact"" with your friends in your home.  ""Rainbow deer marriage"" :)
- Access to your bank from your house
- House can offer useful character buffs
- Can be ""a hub"" (possibly portal to various areas?)
- House isn't intended for player to ""hang out"" there permanently

**PvE**

- Movement/travel abilities for each class allowing you to get from point to point quicker 
- Falling damage exists
- In-game flight still not decided.  ""We have some cool stuff happening which will effect that decision""
- Sprint-double-jump is very important for explorers
- Open world bosses that can take up to 20+ players
- Possible to make double-jump a factor in raids ONLY if it is obvious

**Group Finder**    

- Group Finder tool for Warplots
- Group finder attempts to gather a standard group: 1 tank
- Group finder will teleport you to the dungeon entrance
- Will have a ""looking for group"" channel

**Social**    

- Still haven't decided whether they will allow cross-faction communication.  Currently disabled.
- They are considering limited forms of communication between factions
- They are not currently working on a mobile app but they are interested and would like to in the future.  This includes interaction with auction house
- Unable to discuss whether there is a ""home base"" for guilds -- yet!

**Game General**    

- *The ability to morph into a deer that farts rainbows will debut at PAX*. They were likely *not* joking ;)
- Currently no gambling in the game (betting on PvP).  They have considered it but haven't implemented anything else.
- Use of game controllers is not officially supported but gameplay is well-suited for controllers
- Authenticator being considered as a possibility for account protection
- **Servers in EU(Frankfurt) and US(Dallas) at launch** -- maybe in more locations but they aren't ready to discuss any further.
- Mentioned wanting a good gaming experience in Australia -- possible servers in Australia?
- Big reveals to come at E3
- These guys say ""there has been no official announcement of payment model.  Even if you *think* you know something or have heard something.""
- Will have holiday events
- Implication is, nodes of crafting materials will run away from you).  This was coming from the PvP team so there is a good chance their knowledge is limited

1369244812.0,1euhyn,Highlights of The 5/22 WildStar Info Release,clisby,127,14,127,"**Esper Class**       

- Uses ""power of mind"" to summon illusionary pets
- Not a ""pet class"" as the illusions last &lt;10 seconds
- Class uses both a mana system and charge system (focus point)
- Build up focus points with using multiple abilities like **Telekentic Strike**
- **Telekentic Strike**
- **Concentrated Blades**
- **Mind Burst** uses charges to conjure a large hawk that swoops at a target
- **Crush** skill conjures a large ghost-like fist to punch enemies into the ground. Instant
- Able to summon up to three ""phantoms"" (at least)
- A video snippet shows an Esper running around with two daggers floating above her head (presumably not a bugged out version of telekenetic strike)
- **Phantom Swarm** conjures a phantom for each enemy, dealing 50% assault power damage every 1.25 seconds.  instant, 10s cooldown. Generates a focus point. (one of the media guys was a mouse clicker so I got to see it all :) )

**Scientist Path**    

- Scanning a creature multiple times can unlock ""new advantages""
- Some scans can trigger audio-clips to drive you deeper into a side-quest
- A ""galactive archive"" stores what you've learned about an object (plant, etc) so you can review it later
- Scanning gains Scientist XP, titles, housing equipment(FABKits) and ""unlocks""
- By scanning *loftite* many times
- Small
- Many things you scan will not like being scanned and will be hostile
- Moving objects around can open hidden rooms
- Can name your Scanbot
- Mission Types: Analysis(scan things), Diagnostics(diagnose and fix things like robots), Archaeology (track artifacts), botany(scan flowers?), chemistry(scan inanimate things?), field study(probably going to have combat)
- You will see an icon showing what you should scan such as the loftite crystals
- Not all enemies can be scanned.  An icon will show which can.

**Settler Path**    

- Meant for socializers and also ""builders""
- Tasks include mending broken or degraded equipment such as a farmer's fence which
- True infrastructure tasks include building a new shop
- Smaller ""projects"" helps gather resources for bigger ""projects""
- Can unlock Settler powers that allow you to ""free-farm anywhere""
- There are goals when building -- raise a town's value or utilize your abilities
- Increasing value to a certain extent allows special things to happen like bigger rewards
- Bigger
- If structures aren't maintained
- You can get a lot of path XP by running around and building everything by yourself but less from social tools like campfires
- *almost* everything Settlers do is unphased
- Settlers have utility in dungeons such as being able to make a resurrection station next to a boss -- can use resources that can be found in the dungeon.  Random chance whether many of these resources will appear
- Settlers will be useful when placing structures next to harder areas in the world
- While there are static locations that can be built on
- Settlers will get more housing equipment(FABKits) than other paths 
- Housing dungeons mentioned explicitly after being asked the question ""What sort of perks will Settlers bring to player housing?"" I would not bet on housing dungeons being exclusive to Settlers
- Settlers get increased XP the more their structures are built (campfire
- Speculation: in a video segment about settlers
- Can build quest givers with really good loot
- Video demonstrated the building of a jail which opened up quests for the area and had a warden that could give players a buff
- Can build taxi vendors to allow rapid travel through area 
- Can make outposts with guards in an area to help you fight mobs (not just in towns)
- There is somewhat of a meta where you have to decide where to place structures to get optimal use.  For example build an outpost in the wilderness and choose to put your campfire there.  You can put structures like a campfire in major areas
- Mission types: Expansion(improving towns), Civil Defense(combat, I think), Infrastructure (builds hospitals, taverns, spaceports, etc)
- Can make puzzles appear

**Explorer Path**    

- Will see time challenges going from point A to point B
- Will discover underground passages
- Implies exploring won't be largely flipping back and forth on a map to find a spot.  The explorer dev's quote is ""maps? who needs'em?""
- Mission types: Cartography(chart unexplored territory), Surveillance, Exploration(problem solving to find hidden locations), Operations(think combat, maybe), Staking Claim, Tracking(track enemies)

**Soldier Path**    

- Will have a horde-mode style gameplay
- Summons big-ole bosses
- Mission types: Assassination, First Strike(assault), Demolition, SWAT(test new weapons), Security(item defense), Protect(horde w/ defending allies)

**Paths General**    

- Will be intended benefits to having players with multiple different paths interact.  They call it ""crossing paths""
- It also seems as if you will get bonuses for simply helping another player out with their path
- You can skip path content and path quests
- You get special abilities
- Standard, a scientist will kill, an explorer will scan and a settler will roam


**The World**    

- Very little phasing -- Carbine wants you to feel like your activities are impacting the world
- Towns have values.  This includes an economy, etc).  The town value seems to have a lot to do with settler activity.
- There are areas of the world intentionally made more difficult than others
- Artsy
- A fly-over shows that zones have significantly different appearances.  Someone mentioned how WoW has fairly distinctive zones.  Yea
- Models such as trees aren't all identical
- Looks like roads are fairly clear -- I suspect you could traverse the shown zones end-to-end without fighting by staying on the roads.  I'm sure this is subject to change
- Enemies are close together so you will frequently aggro additional mobs when fighting one.
- You can gain reputation with multiple different factions doing different activities such as repairs

**Housing**    

- There is a strong possibility of having ""housing dungeons"" at launch -- 8 are developed so far
- A garden
- Will be ""rare seeds"" you can plant

**War Plots**    

- Warplots exist
- Warplots are big chunks of land where you and your buddies can build a fortress
- The Warplots can be landed on the ground to fight other Warplots
- You can capture raid bosses
- Captured raid bosses can be sent into an enemy's Warplot
- You can make Mech factories that will allow you to pilot a mech with super powers
- The idea is *destructible fortress vs destructible fortress*
- Up to 40v40 destructible fortress PvP

**Character Advancement**

- Stats (brutality, ""special powers that unlock talent-ish things"", or cause effects such as when you kill a monster it drops a ""healing glob""
- Stat unlocks are intended to help you ""change how you play your character"" rather than just marginal stat increases for min/maxes
- Talent trees are not currently used
- Acheivements done in the Elder Game can unlock skills and perks(?!)
- Character race and path can determine difficulty of earning unlocks (Granoks have easier time with strength unlocks)
- You ""won't cripple yourself by making the wrong decision

**Gear**    

- Carbine doesn't like a lot of people standing around with the same gear on in endgame
- Carbine thinks the greatest differentiation should be at the high level
- Randomized elements on equipment
- Customized gear
- ""Points"" that unlock powers to make you different than the guy next to you
- COSTUMES mentioned

**Tradeskills**    

- Not on the reveal schedule yet
- Do NOT want to have you ""click a node and watch a bar fill up""
- Lots of ""interesting base metals"" in the game such as Explodium which explodes when you hit it
- Hitting a rock can uncover that it is attached to an enemy which you then have to chase and knock materials off it
- A node may be a creature made from the material who then swallows you and you have to knock through the creature's stomach to escape
- Farming mats should have ""variance"" and not be boring
- Their system intends to combat bot farmers
- Crafting should be more acheivement-type advancement
- Player-planted gardens have a RNG effect where they can spawn enemies


**Combat**    

- Environmental effects can damage players and enemies such as Explodium nodes
- Player is shown swimming and underwater fights are mentioned
- As a noob you will be trying to dodge enemy abilities.  Later on you (the player
- Looks like at least some channeled abilities can be cancelled out of early to dodge
- When dead you can res in your current spot for a sizable chunk of money (14.7silver out of the player's 1.2gold in the demo) with a 30 minute cooldown or you can rez free at the ""nearest Holo-Crypt""
- There is

**End Game**    

- They feel end-game is the most important to WS's success
- Currently 50-70% of the team is dedicated to elder content
- Elder content needs to be replayable
- Want content to be hard
- Want content to be something ""you look forward to""

**Raids**    

- ""We wanted to make raiding something that more people can compete in"" -- their words
- World firsts are awesome for the 1% of the 1%
- Randomness of raids is to make it more engaging for the non 1% of the 1%
- Randomness includes putting down a health-increasing spot that pops up or having extra AoE damage that spreads in various patterns
- Want ""fastest raid time"" to be a goal
- Want to add more goals -- ""Fable-like"" challenges such as defeating bosses without armor
- Monsters are going to have different phases (don't think this surprises anyone)

**Dungeons**    

- Even 5-mans set to be hard
- Dungeons are looking great, varied and interesting.

**Vehicles**    

- A player is piloting a large mech.  Looks fluid
- A player is shown shooting ground targeted missiles while riding the motorcycle

**Quests**    

- Dynamic quests -- pop up while doing other things in the zone (thinking like SWTOR).  A lot of time based challenges
- Spin-the-wheel loot system: after finishing the dynamic quest
- If you hover over a quests it will display an arrow on your screen


**Game**    

- Implied it costs ~$100 million
- While not a focus
- List of ""Events"" in the bottom right...  perhaps large map events like in GW2?
- Currently 200+ hours of solo(able) content
- Walk-throughs are bad
- Payment model is a HYBRID MODEL.  The most common hybrid model from NCSoft seems to be an F2P with an optional subscription.  This doesn't rule out a B2P(GW2-style) system.  Either way most can rest easier knowing this reduces the likelihood of strong advantages for paying customers.

&gt;**Our goal is to support as many abilities in the LAS as a skilled player can use without custom hardware (30-button mouses etc).  It turns out that while dodging, moving, jumping, etc. we were finding super low numbers of folks using even the upper ends of the bar.**

&gt;**So...will it change?  Probably, either through unlocking via the elder advancement system or otherwise so people can tune the way they want to play, but data and feedback will drive us (as through most things).**

&gt;Originally posted by TheHavok

&gt;Hello Mr. Gaffney

&gt;My question is more on the business side of Wildstar's development and Carbine Studio's creation.  It has been repeated multiple times that many of the developers that worked on Wildstar were former Blizzard developers.  And there has been comparisons made between Wildstar and WoW.  As somebody who greatly enjoyed WoW for many years

&gt;I would like to know who came up with the idea to start Carbine Studios. Additionally

&gt;Second question: So many games seem to release unfinished products, as opposed to games like Warhammer Online and SWTOR which were launched with a myriad of issues.

&gt;It feels like, it seems like the developers have the final say.

&gt;Thanks!


&gt;**The team was originally formed of about 20 seniors and leads off of the World of Warcraft team - but since then (we're now many years later and more like 220 people and growing) we have folks from EQ1/2, WAR, and probably most of the other western MMOs big and small.  And a good crop of noobs on their first MMO too (new blood is good too).**

&gt;**I was the executive (VP Product Development) on the NCsoft side who signed the team initially (with Robert Garriott, and big games want to go to Korea with a major partner) and honestly this was just the coolest project in the industry in my mind, so I joined here fulltime 4-5 years back or so.**

&gt;**Anyhoo I'm as senior as it gets in Carbine.  Within NCsoft I report to our CEO and our Global CEO and they are both gamers, even in a megacorp.**

&gt;Originally posted by Tamath

&gt;Will PvE in Wildstar be a never-ending arms race to get the latest wave of shiny gear before it is obsoleted with a patch

&gt;Similarly

&gt;**We've put some spin on the standard loot-grind cycle by allowing you to invest in gear over time as well as outright replace it, housing advancement (fairly deep, lots of investment is tied there), warplot advancement, and probably others I'm forgetting).**

&gt;**So I don't promise that there's no gearing up

-----------------

&gt;Originally posted by kittykatdp

&gt;are there going to be anymore ArkShip Events before Launch??

&gt;**As many as we can cram in, and sounding out opinions is actually quite useful to us, never mind that it's fun in it's own right).  We'll try to do some mini-arkships at least alongside whichever shows we attend.**

--------------------

&gt;Originally posted by Bainik

&gt;I'd like to comment on the flying mount controversy if you don't mind.

&gt;I think a lot of the people bashing flying mounts are coming from WoW where they really did and continue to have a terrible impact on the world. WoW is fundamentally played on a 2D surface and while you move through 3 space going over a hill it's still just a curved surface. When flying mounts were introduced suddenly the entire game was tied to a surface

&gt;&lt;clippy clippy for space&gt;

&gt;**Other alternatives include limited flight (via a gas tank on your speederplane or w/e)

And dammit it does look good! But despite that, but pretty hard to dig down and figure out what you may generally be concerned about in terms of the game. And honestly, voicing that concern is perhaps the biggest thing you can do to help the devs.

* For me, not just cookie cutter fruit of the month stuff. At the very least, I'd like 10+ ""Cookie cutter"" specs to choose from that are all roughly equally viable. Ultimately, jumping between builds is perhaps the most fun I have in RPGs.

* I'm also a bit apprehensive about 40 man raid content. I think it'll be fun and challenging, and online at one time is daunting, and as someone that likes to progress through content in his own guild, I'm a bit scared by it. 

* Not knowing the payment model is a bit scary, have much worse online communities then any other games. When you have a pay wall, people act a bit differently, but if it's free and people can just hop on another account, and don't have repercussions for being a huge dick(League anyone?).

* Another thing that worries me is community. Back in ever quest

* I've played guild wars 2

* I worry that the dynamic group content may play out the same way in Wildstar.

1368820272.0,1ejc4a,My notes on the Jeremy Gaffney interview on 5/17,StayFrostty,63,5,68,"Hey all


**Warplots** - Grey/white mode, 40v40, can capture downed raid bosses and pit against enemies.

**Mentoring** - Very very geared to social interction. Mentored player will only be slightly weeker than the Mentor. Rewards for helping lower levels. The option for power-running is there

**Settlers** buffing quest hubs and setting up some outposts in vunerable areas for ""kicking ass and taking names"" TONS of real environment interaction.

**Friends and family testing** - ~500 people
Closed beta is focused more on PVP

**Flying mounts?**- He likes them, but unsure if they will release to closed beta.

**CBT2** - 2000 more people on top of the original..
Stress test - ~15000 people will get keys. Not focused on hyping game. All stress testers get beta accesss ASAP. CBT3 or Stress test 2 will happen in 5+ weeks. Intend for players to have a full community running (guilds, friends list) 

**Currently ~300k beta keys have been uniquely logged on**

**Housing** - Currently jumping back and forth between instanced or not. Possibly trying to slot housing and warplots into the world environment

**Scientist** - ""Human OCD type stuff"" Searching, and learning why the fights are taking place through a series of quests, where as a soldier would walk in, trip a trap, and get into fight content.

**Paths** - Effect types of quest you get. 70% of zone content is for everybody. 25-30% is based strictly on your path

**Payment Models** - Based strongly off what has worked best. They have a large focus on what does work for us gamers

**Servers** - Beta data center in Dallas

**Telegraphs within raids** - Focused on the interaction with your own telegraphs overlapping the rest of your party

**Weekly/monthly rewards for server best's in PVE. No mention of PVP

Deep character customization guarenteed

**E-sports* *  Spectator will help make it a bit more entertaining

**Roleplayers** - Paths and housing try to help tell a story about who you are as a player. Looking for more sandbox type play for people who are interested in more social interaction. Can throw parties or host events in your house.

**World PVP** - CBT3 Will have world PVP. Eldergame looking more towards warplots. No ""capture this for your faction"" like hellfire towers in WoW.

Australian servers possible

**Crafting** - Lots of info to come, then MAKE C of Z. Jeremy wants to have a single big reveal.

**Economy**- Central access points for auctionhouse and other econ. resources. AH plans to stay single server

**/emotes** - TONS of them

**Raid attunements** - Developers are PRO-Attunement

**Housing is planned to be functional. Decorations are going to be vast

**Housing Dungeons**  - Items found outside in PVE content can be brought home to unlock certain peices of a ""puzzle""

**Guilds*  * - Logos, lots of guild development. Lots to come.

**Circle System** - Groups of like-interest people. Can be in multiple circles

I hope this can inform atleast one person. The gamefaqs board is way to quiet for me.

But it was all in the details in the end. The combat felt boring quickly

All these problems came actually from little details to make the game appeal more to the more causal / actionRPG market. For me it felt just like that

Now the direction of WildStar seems to be less casual and more of a mix between GW2 and vanilla-WoW. So on paper it seems better. But still im affraid that once it launches possible little details about the implementation of creative ideas backfire. My biggest fear is the idea to try to please as many people as possible that in the end make the game lack depth.

1.) Carbine/NCSoft have a serious opporunity to make a lot of money by combining Housing and microtransactions (and I have a **very slight** suspicion that

2.) No **popular and successful** game has been strictly subscription-based aside from EVE and WoW (at least that I've heard of

That being said

At open-beta launch, and the game seemed big (even though the game world and content is really quite small). 

After two-three weeks

This wasn't what got me about the game, trolls, and people who simply didn't know what they were doing while acting like they did. I mostly quit because I didn't feel there was a real community (this will probably improve overtime in Neverwinter, but right now, it's not good). By the way, I'm not saying Neverwinter is a bad MMO, I'm saying it has problems. Neverwinter is an average MMO. That was the first step to me discovering my desire for the P2P model in Wildstar.

Then I went back to GW2 for about a week. I haven't played since around January, no. Dead in the sense that there was NOBODY around! Maybe it was just my server (and I was on a HUGE server in January), but there were so little people, even in Lion's Arch. There were still a good amount of people at the huge dynamic events, but not nearly as many as I remember. 

Now, of course, WvWvW was pointless to join because nothing had really changed and structured PvP was just as... nothing as it had ever been. There was nothing to do! 

Regardless, the gem store is still, apparently, successful because what they did with it was excellent (and if Wildstar has a Protostar shop, they need to do something similar). 

Finally, but I noticed something. WoW is still a high quality game. The community is still booming. Everything is available to everyone. Everyone has to work to progress (if you want to call raid finder and whatever work). Yet, I got bored really fast. Why? The leveling is pointless (as it has been since Cata) and everything is streamlined. It's basically impossible to enjoy the leveling content at its intended level unless you're doing the Iron Man Challenge (which now that I mention it, sounds like fun). My point is, the only purpose of the game is end game! I get that, and all, but it felt empty (it has never felt empty for me before).

Then I had a thought. What if there was a game with quality endgame that doesn't streamline the leveling process

And then I realized that would probably be what Wildstar will look like if it is subscription-based. At that point

1368866838.0,1ekhz6,How about gliding?,kuroioni,54,8,49,"In the 'flying or no flying' dispute there seems to be considerably little said about the third option available

What I mean is

For those of you who don't really know what that means

* [gliding in Aion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcl0jR1Pml8)

* [gliding in Archeage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nTTyNArxCRM)

Basically, while being subject to forces such as gravity (you cannot glide indefinitely), wind currents (makes you turn, glide faster or slower) or hot air pockets (gaining and losing altitude). You can also 'dismount' in mid-air and fall (cover a large vertical distance considerably faster than by other means), saving yourself in the last moment by re-entering the gliding state (if a cooldown allows).

What's not to love

Advantages of such a system are many:

* not only does it allow for uninterrupted exploring

* doesn't trivialize the content/environment;

* on the contrary to above point - it allows for new and exciting ways of moving through the land;

* allows for fun pvp scenarios;

* social 'games' (finding exciting places to glide over

* if done properly (as a game mechanic) will be reliant on the player's skill (the better you utilize the technique the farther/faster you can get

The most apparent disadvantage, I believe this is the main argument against flying in the first place? 

Other than that

1370261739.0,1fkrod,Ideas while lying in bed trying to sleep.,Ortylz,55,17,39,"So I had a pretty cool idea for a zone in Wildstar

The idea is basically a zone with some kind of extreme environmental biosphere, it could be huge and sparse but most importantly procedural generated. Within this zone as a result of the threatening atmosphere condition in order to traverse you would  need some kind of consumable, like a gas mask filter or a thermal battery fueled generator which you acquired outside of the zone through random drops, crafting or just buying them outright.

Some options which you could include:

-  Gathering nodes in which you could find higher quality materials

- Rare spawning mobs which drop super rare mounts

- Levels of atmosphere stability

- PvP would always be enabled throughout the zone and killing players within the zone would award you with a greater amount or different currency used to purchase cool aesthetic changes / titles (such as bandit [Name])

- Different conditions during different weeks, one week snow, requiring different consumables and rewarding different things.

There are hundreds of possibilities you could add and it would not require much work to code and keep constantly changing / adding things as long as you sort the random generated stuff out. The zone could change every 24 hours or every 48

Edit - just another expansion from the comments and myself regarding paths - paths could be used to great affect within the zone, even have a tool to PREDICT the next condition or make consumable more efficient, explorers could be able to map out the current zone, and then sell maps of the zone to others, obviously being able to do this every time it changes, the possibilities really would be endless, and awesome.

1368926363.0,1elvq2,Raiding in Wildstar: Innovative or behind the times?,mw1100,52,19,238,"While nothing has been shown in the beta yet

Here's a compilation of the important bits and my take on the pros and cons of each.  

**40 and 20 person raids**  

Giant groups of people taking on equally giant bosses.  A throwback to vanilla WoW or Everquest raiding where every boss required a large numbers of players to defeat.  

Good:
&gt;Epic feel - More people make even dull fights feel epic.  
&gt;Nostalgia - Feels like raiding in 2006
&gt;Get carried - Large raids allow for more room for error

Bad:
&gt;Herding cats - Hardest part of a large raid is organizing one.  
&gt;Low individual recognition - Everyone is a face in the crowd with few unique roles or responsibilities.  
&gt;Simple mechanics - With very few exceptions
&gt;Less popular - WoW 25man raiding has nearly died while 10mans have become significantly more popular.  
  
  
**Attunements**  

Individual or group preparation to access raid content.  Another throwback to early WoW and Everquest, or clearing older content to participate in the newest raids.  

Good: 
&gt;Feeling of accomplishment - You earned your way into the raid. Go you!  
&gt;Proof of ability - If challenging enough the attunement weeds out low-skill players.  
&gt;Storytelling opportunity - Attunements provide the opportunity to show players why the raid is important.  

Bad:
&gt;Catch-up is a hassle - Having to redo attunements anytime you bring a new raider gets old
&gt;Inconvenient - Logically, not work.  


**Extremely difficult**  

Again, taking away the mystery of the content and pride that goes with entering a raid and killing bosses.  

Quote: (Jeremy Gaffney
&gt;For players who like playing cooperatively:  We want epically hard raids

Good:
&gt;Each kill is more satisfying - Assuming the fight is fun
&gt;Longer progression race - If bosses are harder it will take longer for guilds to clear all the content.  
&gt;Hero worship - If you see someone with raid gear

Bad:
&gt;Alienates all but the best - Many people like large cooperative boss fights but aren't particularly skilled.  
&gt;Harder to recruit - Makes for a smaller raiding community which makes recruitment more difficult.  
&gt;Higher chance of ""guild killer"" bosses - If bosses are tuned to be too tough
&gt;More class stacking - The harsher the tuning


**Dynamic encounter mechanics**  

One of the most unique elements of Wildstar's raiding game, instead of just simply beating the only version of a boss fight.  This isn't a new idea, having been used sparingly in World of Warcraft, with Halfus, Omnotron, Spirit Kings, and other fights that changed weekly or between pulls.  

Quote (Mike Donatelli
&gt;“Imagine a boss room in a raid. Then imagine a boss room where I can swap plugs

Good: 
&gt;Dynamic feel - If a fight is always changing
&gt;Hard to master - If the fight is always changing

Bad:
&gt;Hard to master - Defeating a boss one week only to not be able to the next due to changing mechanics is a demoralizing experience
&gt;Hard to tune - Changing mechanics can result in significantly increased challenges week to week.  For example
&gt;Progression burnout - If guilds are competing for top rankings every week

**Edit**: It should also be noted that the leaked [M30 patch notes](http://www.wildstar-online.com/en/news/m30_patch_notes.php) that Carbine themselves released delineate some of the more heal-focused Spellslinger abilities. Those notes also appear to be more up to date than this info is.

1367897229.0,1du9mc,Wildstar: The Unbeatable Zone,syhrd,45,11,45,"Hello All

Reading this article about the [focus on Raiding](http://www.zam.com/story.html?story=32326) left me pondering this quote.

&gt;""4) There's some magic involved. Picture a game with no nigh-inaccessible content. You can go anywhere the first month, and that game's pretty damn fun. But from another...I dunno, it's pretty tough to have a mysterious, huge-feeling world when you can trivially do it all, and even in games I don't want to or don't have time to raid in I'd like to know there's more out there. That's arguable though.""

What makes an MMO live to my mind is the sense that there is content that must be earnt.  Content that goes beyond the planned level grind.

This gave me the idea that Wildstar should have an unbeatable end-game zone.  By this I mean an entire zone

This unbeatable zone would contain items, content that would become the stuff of legend within the Wildstar community.  The reason for a zone and not a dungeon is it provides a more open-world feel.  You can go alone, but you will not survive the experience.  Even at cap with gear, this zone should be dangerous.

This may seem fiscally risky to invest dev time in content that maybe no one will ever experience.  But that sense of mystery

**I got the idea to start this topic after reading that many people share my concern with too much limitless teleporting.**



When I hear developers talking about how they are going to implement ways for players to teleport all over the world

When I first heard (at PAX) that Carbine was seemingly carelessly implementing flying mounts into the game, having people actually on the ground).

Then I heard that the LFG Tool they designed will instantly teleport you and your group to the dungeon entrance (after you have discovered the dungeon). Also, yet you keep this implementation in the game? Why make this big and beautiful game world if players are just going to bypass it all by teleporting everywhere? 

Flying mounts and teleporting are the two biggest causes that I have seen in MMOs for worlds being vacant. Do not make these mistakes; allow your world to feel alive by incentivising world play. Do not discourage it.

I am not saying that there should be a complete absence of teleportation. Teleportation can be great

Here are some examples of ways teleportation was

1. Using my ""mage portal"" example again, they could simply find a mage and ask he, or she to port them. This might seem like an insignificant form of community building, but it all adds up. Based on what we know, I would say that the Esper is a great candidate for a porting spell.

2. Thirty minutes to one hour cool-down on the teleportation to your house (hearthstone-esque feature).

3. Summoning stones (as seen in WoW). When a queue is complete in the LFG tool

4. A member of our community (Sabre

I know that many other community members here on Wildstar-Central and on the Wildstar subreddit feel as strongly as I do about this

I was pleasantly surprised with how fun the NW combat was. The biggest difference between NW combat and other mmos is that you cannot move while attacking, and being knocked down by a powerful attack from a monster takes you out of combat for a solid 5-7 seconds. 

It is my hope that Wildstar doesn't fall into the problem that GW2 had, and pretty much all of my friends, dislike it.

Obviously Wildstar doesn't have to adopt either method

**Title**: BUSINESS MODEL: F2P IS THE BEST MODEL...

**Content**:... for current MMOs'. What worked for previous games  that might work/fail is that...

**Reality**: If you knew a billion dollar business model, for a million dollar company. AND ADD A QUESTION MARK OR ""DISCUSSION"" IN THE TITLE. Else everyone will think you a crappy economist. Nobody wants that. You might have amazing insight, but it gets lost after thinking ""New Info, this person knows what is up!... Oh.""



**Title**: THE VIDEO/ARTICLE/FORUM  WILDSTAR NEEDS TO SEE...

**Content**: Why did failed games (the author perceives as failures

**Reality**:  An egotistical gamer who can only site flaws with previous/current MMO's, shouldn't compare everything to WoW, and then declare that their vid/article/forum will change the industry forever.

And their ""idea"" will be going back to vanilla WoW after it hit 4 million, that nostalgic experience that can never be recreated because that's when they fell in love with MMO's...

 Yeah they want that again.

PvP is epic anyways but when you have that added risk that you may end up losing your most expensive item it really gets the heart pounding. It may just be that im a sucker for hardcore style content but its a great mechanic which unfortunately i haven't seen since in any MMO i have played.

1366396718.0,1covdx,War Plots and how they re-invent PVP,Belyal,29,6,41,"Pardon me while I ramble on but eventually I'll get to my point...

I have to say the more and more they show us inside Nexus

Now I've played pretty much everything as far as MMOs go and have been surprisingly happy with some and gravely disappointed by others (SWTOR being the most recent disappointment) and I must say I have been dying to find an MMO that really sucks me back in the way MUDs did back in the day and the way WOW did back in the Vanilla WOW days.

WildStar has definitely become that game, and I haven't even played it yet! I could go on and on about all the amazing things that Carbine Studios seems to be doing right but I really want to talk about War Plots and what they mean to PVP in this MMO.

Now obviously there isn't too much that we know about War Plots yet and we'll learn more and more as time goes on but for me War Plots mean EPIC end game Faction Battles! For me this is one of the coolest things ever! WOW had AV which was an awesome PVP warzone that had dozens of players in it

Now there were obviously issues with AV but it was a massive PVP battle and that made it exciting to me and millions the world over. SWTOR failed in their PVP in that it was only 8v8 and still is... Sure there was Ilum which was ""end game"" PVP fighting but they didn't do it right and they tied ""flipping switches"" to the outcome, sure not everyone wants to do PVP but that's what PVE and RP servers are for... SWTOR never had a working Massive PVP anything and it sucked for me. 

Now we have Carbine Studios that has not only take to the MASSIVE theme for PVP but they have also put it in the hands of the players! We get to build War Plots! We get to create PVP war zones and we get to decide just how dastardly we want them to be. This now grants us unlimited replay-ability in PVP because no two War Plots will be the same. This concept is staggering to me and is exactly what a LOT of MMO players want and need to keep their attention long term. 
Sure huge raids are awesome and I cannot wait to run them a thousand times to gear up and get another monster head trophy for my house but the thought of creating a fortress of sorts and putting all kinds of monster ""traps"" in it sounds truly awesome! I mean the simple fact that we can create our own war zone areas is awesome enough but we can even capture and place world/raid bosses in our Plots... ""Ohh no we are being overrun quick fall back"" and ""defend"" then ""RELEASE THE KRAKEN!!!!!"" Bam the other team is in chaos now trying to fight you and some gargantuan world eating monster! I simply love the idea of putting epic PVP battles in the hands of the user and letting us tailor them.

It's a win no matter how you look at it! A win for PVP and a win for MMOs... WOW definitely set the bar high for MMOs and people have been trying to copy Blizzard's success but this takes PVP in an MMO to a whole new level and I cannot wait to jump into this game and hopefully even test this bad boy out in Beta.

**Update 2-16-2013:**  I have fixed 2 of the 4 big issues people have had with the theme.  I'll try and get on the other items when I get more time.  The colors have been slightly modified to keep up with the new look over @ the official WildStar Homepage.  Hope you guys and gals enjoy!

**More Updates...**:  
I have gone back through and tried to fix the RES bugs with commenting.  You can now read comments with RES enabled, I'd recommend disabling it for this sub-reddit if possible.  I do apologize for the lack of proper RES support.  It(RES) has TONS of bugs that need to be fixed before any real CSS themeing can be done.

**Limited Action Sets**  
I remember reading a post how this was recently decreased to 7 class abilities down from 9, all I can say is...  


Thank you. Thank you so much. *Please* keep the mindset of a lower amount of necessary keybinds. I say this for a few reasons (WoW is going to be used as the primary example


**1.) Balance** - As with any situation, and this is in no small part due to the sheer number of skills and classes that have to be balanced. With every expansion, new skills have been introduced without necessarily negating the old ones, leading to a monumental number of abilities across 11 different classes (and this doesn't even include racial abilities.) I don't fault the developers for imbalance, nor do I claim I could perform better; rather, I simply argue that not getting into such a situation in the first place is the better course of action.  


**2.) Accessibility** - I logged into multiple characters today to check my keybinds. My mage has 41, not including other binds such as setting a focus, targetting a focus, targetting specific arena targets or party members, etc. That's a lot of keybinds.  


So many, nor introduce anyone new. For the record, I've tried. A lot. Two individuals came back, arena'd for a few weeks, and quit because they claimed there was no way they could learn about all the different skills of 11 different classes while simultaneously mastering their own class, at least not without devoting the amount of time that raiders do to the game. And that amount of time is precisely why a lot of folks go to PvP instead of raiding. I also introduced a friend to the game brand new, and they gave out before two months. The reasoning? ""I've never played a game with so many $%&amp;^ing buttons. This isn't even fun.""  

    
PvPers *crave* competition, and the result is a less competitive environment.  

    
**3.) Alts** - Alts are an element of any MMO that helps to keep things ""fresh."" Getting bored with your class? Play a different one. But if you're a PvPer in a game like WoW

What is you take on the topic?

I personally believe games lacking flying mounts make MMO games feel very ""boxed"" in and two dimensional I.E. GW2 and NW (which I'm currently playing.) 

I feel flying mounts add to the reward feeling of accomplishing max level. 

I recall my first time seeing someone on a flying mount back when I played the burning crusade in WoW. It was awe inspiring

The big debate was it killed open world pvp. This is where I feel WoW gets it very much right. Don't allow flying mounts in the new zones i.e. thunder isles (the latest max level zone in WoW) This keeps the element of owpvp where it belongs

Most owpvp is done at max level unless your a low lvl ganking bully that gets no benefit out of ganking low leveling players other then personal enjoyment. This type of owpvp is pointless and just another form of internet bullying and shouldn't be aloud. Hell I play on a pvp sever in WoW and when I leveled

You've got dungeons, arenas, battlegrounds, achievement hunting and collecting.

But at the end of the day


Obtaining gear in wildstar

However, and minuses, and a myriad of design philosophy that surrounds them.

Lets look to WoWs current PvE design first:

* Upon hitting 90, or gold on the AH that will get you up to the entry level heroic dungeons.

* This first gear ""hurdle"" can take about 12 hours if you know what you're doing. 

* Upon stepping over this hurdle, wait for drops, or do daily quests to get over the next hurdle, which is entrance into raids through either the raid finder, or with a group or guild.

* The process of gearing within raids is an artificial time constraint, caps on PvE points, all prevent you from getting your entire set of gear.

* Finally, unless you're a month late to the party, this is the only level of gear progression that requires learning and ability to adapt to obtain gear.

* On top of all this

So looking at this example, and then hard to obtain the biggest set of gear.

Positive:

* Everyone gets a set of endgame gear extremely quickly as soon as they hit the max level. 

* There is an option for people who want the ""Best"" gear in the game

* Gearing up at the start is easy

Negative:

* There is an extremely low skill cap on obtaining the gear. It isn't a challenge to obtain a full set of end game gamer.

* The difference between the best

* Players that don't want to take the step into heroic raids

* There isn't a feel of accomplishment when everyone is running around with the same gear as you.

Is the WoW model ideal? Does every piece of end game gear need to be a struggle and hard fought achievement?

This doesn't even touch on PvP

What method would you prefer or like to see in Wildstar?",self,t5_2sqwc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1enslq/end_game_gear_acquisition_the_woes_of_gearing_too/

So

In WoW, Paladins could kneel and summon a column of light in prayer, etc. Minor glyphs were a big step forward in this regard. These skills gave no real advantage to anyone, but instead added personality, individuality, flavour and were generally just lots of fun. There's a huge amount of time spent in MMOs not doing battle, having the right abilities to use during exploration or social hangouts went a long way.
To an extent, but gave classes that little bit of extra personality.

On the flip side, as well as battlecries and setting traps, but this won't help a Stalker to pickpocket their unsuspecting victims or assist an Esper in meditating, bringing mind and body together.

The point I'm getting at is that although I'm vastly excited about Wildstar, which gave me hope. =]

Personally I have a few things I'd like to see in the game and how I think it should turn out:

1. 
Please don't go Pay-to-win or free-to-play.

If the dev team has been following the recent launch of Neverwinter (perfect realm's mmo). The cash shop is pretty ridiculous and really seems to turn off players from playing the game because of the high prices and idea that if you have money
Possibly have a hybrid based system where there is an option for players to unlock ALL the content with a subscription based system and the standard system that comes with the normal copy of the game..
	
2. 
Keep levelling nice and slow/rewarding and fun

Hopefully it won't take a few weeks to get to the level cap
(I hope you guys know what I mean

3. 
Give us stuff to do when in the main home area/hub(?)

Players spend alot of time in the main hub waiting for their friends, selling items etc etc. I was thinking maybe adding fun little gameplay areas within the main hub's to keep players busy, for example, since jumping puzzles seem to be littered within the game world, maybe have various jumping platforms through the area with a xp boost or something once players reach the top, have a item seller or some sort or just have it there for fun..
I'm sure there are many other things that could be added aswell.

That's all I could really think of right now and please don't get me wrong I LOVE how the game is turning out right now and I'm not bashing it!
Lastly, but I'm really excited about this game and wanted to add my thoughts.

Please post and voice some of your thoughts!

They don't want a game that ends. They don't want to make a game for you that you feel like you've beaten. A great MMO never lets you feel done.

If you build endgame content that's exactly what it will feel like. Stuff you do once you're done. But you're done the game... Why do this extra crap they threw in to keep me busy if I finished leveling (I'm looking at you SWTOR and GW2).

If you even just skim over the above information you'll see that ArenaNet (developer) has supposedly suffered greatly under NCSoft (publisher) and their new investor Nexon. So much so that ArenaNet has possibly added content to GW2 expressing their distaste with their current situation with NCSoft/Nexon.

Most of it supposedly has to do with the payment model GW2 chosen (B2P with Cash Shop) and how NCSoft/Nexon is controlling all the content in the game to revolve around it (similar to D3 being designed around its AH/RMAH).

Having said that

I personally believe that Carbine has already proved themselves to be great developers to rival the likes of even ArenaNet solely based on what we've seen of Wildstar so far (not to say ArenaNet is a bad developer

**Edit: Thank you CRB_Gaffer for the quick response. It was just what I wanted to hear. Looking forward to trying the game out. [Link to response](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b27t6/things_i_hope_carbine_keep_in_mind_when_making/c92ylff)**


I'd like to start off by saying that I'm pretty new to being a Wildstar follower. I've known about the game for quite some time now but only recently (last week) got really involved with it. This game looks to be incredible, AoC, Warhammer online, GW2, SWTOR, Rift and more. so I've experienced my fair share of disappointing games (not saying all games mentioned were disappointing). The game I've played the most is WoW. 

If you can help me ease my mind or have your own opinion on some of these things. please leave a response. Like to add something to the list? again

**First off: Unresponsive Camera and Movement**
This is a MAJOR concern of mine when it comes to new games. Some games have a little bit of lag when pressing WASD keys or moving the camera. it might just be a few too many milliseconds delay
It might be hard to see what i mean through a video
Yes

Another thing about camera controls that can break the gameplay experience is the ""smart camera follow mode"" or whatever it's called. Where the camera automatically swings back behind the character. I don't mind the option being there. What I do mind is when there's no option to turn it off. 

*Edit: In Ta2punk's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b27t6/things_i_hope_carbine_keep_in_mind_when_making/c92x2z2) he explained that it seem to work like we want it too. that's a relief.* 

**AddOns**
I've heard that this game will allow addon support. I like UI addons and don't mind them at all. I just hope that Carbine will be really careful of what they allow in the API. 

**Heirloom Gear** 
I haven't heard anything solid on this yet. They did say ""I unfortunately cannot answer your Heirloom question
I don't mind heirlooms if they're implemented correctly. I like that you can get gear to help leveling alts. The bonus xp on it and scaling with level is fine and it would feel pointless without it. What I don't like about the WoW heirloom gear is that it's so strong. In my opinion the scaling and xp bonus is enough. it should have stats kind of between green and blue gear (in wow)

**Path system abilities** 
(i cant find it right now
I heard somewhere, only to find out at the elder game that I should have chosen soldier cause it has the best skills for a warrior.  If anyone have info on this it would be much appreciated. 

*Edit: Ta2punk's [comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1b27t6/things_i_hope_carbine_keep_in_mind_when_making/c92x2z2) cleared this up. if it's only abilities to help you do the path quests. then that's great :)*

**""Dual specialization""**
I'm not sure how the ""speccing"" works in this game yet. But I know each class has at least 2 roles. I want to be able to play both roles or maybe even have a pvp and a pve spec. It's not about the gold cost for me. It's about the annoyance of running and respecing all the time. maybe even several times in a day. 

**Botting
This will probably be the most obvious of the topics. I (and probably everyone else) hate bots

**I think it was something else i wanted to bring up. But can't remember it atm. If i think of it I'll update my post**

1364175102.0,1ay429,My PvP Concerns (Tier list from AMA),,19,5,41,"I'm a PVP enthusiast

Here is the topic of concern to me:

**""We will have a tiered reward system for PvP
Warplot Rewards &gt; Arena Rewards &gt; Battleground Rewards""**

Why does this statement bother me? Because with a lack of explanation

I will first say that I'm very passionately following Wildstar. I'm a part of the WSC community

Now here is my reasoning:

**Warplots**

Currently warplots have been referred to as the elder game for PVP. Which makes sense when you see this tiered list. Warplots will give the top rewards for PVP. 

**Warplots should be second in tier.** *Why?* 

Warplots will most likely be 10-40 man PVP. My concern is that when PVP is anything higher than 10 people, there is always a elite raiding guild where everyone is amazing. Even so, my point is still valid.

The only way I could see this work in a decent fashion being the top tier pvp reward is through PVP guilds. PVP isn't as appealing as PVE for guilds. I doubt there will be more than 1-2 PVP 40 man guilds (active) on any server. Either way

**It just feels to me PVP in Wildstar is viewed as some secondary option. Where raiding is the top tier option for the game. They should be equals

Arena&gt;Warplots&gt;Battlegrounds

**Arena**

* You play arena with a group of 2
* You play weekly when your group is available. Climbing the ELO ladder and unlocking options for better gear.

**Warplots**

* You play with a guild or get a invite into a group starting up a warplot battle (sorta like the bosses in wintergrasp. Get gear doing this optional content which is better than solo gear ""battleground""
* Is most likely made Tier 1 to get people to play them. Maybe they don't want it to be overlooked or rot if it serves no major purpose. This is understandable

**Battlegrounds**

* Play for fun with buddies.
* Play solo when bored or needing to practice. 
* Grind extra gear.
* BG's are like dungeons for PVPers IMO. Same goal and idea.

**Make Arena top tier for PVP.** IMO 2v2

**TLDR;** I feel like Warplots being tier 1 allows any joe blow the ability to have top tier PVP gear. From a competitive PVPers POV this feel like crap. I feel that arena should be top tier. This to me is more competitive and allows the better PVP players to stand out. Condensed group play &gt; Large zerg group play for PVP. Raiding is a whole different scenario. 40 man raids might be bad ass and work well fighting AI. Making top tier PVP 40 man is just not the same all and all.

A ton of this is speculation. I'm not even 100% that they will have 2

My first huge post for Wildstar. I figured if I love the game enough I should give my honest opinions on the things that concern me. Thanks for taking the time to read this and anyone who gives their insight.

1375286619.0,1jff0b,Dungeon/Raid Attunement? 'Bumping up' the gear for each content patch?,truant19,19,7,108,"Hey Guys

I am just wondering if Carbine has ever mentioned their philosophy when it comes to dungeon/raid attunement

For players who don't know, each time there is a new raid and new higher tier of gear, they upgrade the tier of gear you can earn in the lowest difficulty dungeons. This process ensures you never have to raid 'old' content.

For example, and Raid T2. With 3 tiers of gear. When Raid T3 gets introduced, the Raid T1 gear can be earned in heroics, meaning that Raid T1 can now be skipped in the 'progression'. When T4 comes out, then T2 gear can now be earned in heroics, allowing two tiers of raids to be skipped. Blizzard made this change at the very end of BC and has stuck with the philosophy.

There is some back and forth on whats better, you would have to...

Farm normal dungeons for rep

Get kara attunement in normal dungeons

Get kara gear

Get Heroic gear (once honored by the appropriate reputation from farming normals

Start to raid Grulls 25

Once killing both end bosses of KT and SCC you can then raid Hyjal

After defeating Hyjal you can then enter BT.

After BT blizzard introduced sunwell, basically removing any need for Grulls, KT and SCC.

I can totally see there reasoning, but I figure that's the point of expansions. Its a reset that allows everyone to start their new journey on a level playing field. I personally feel like having a large 'journey' that my character takes is part of what motivates me to play. When leveling new characters, having to start them at the begining of the journey was exciting and fun, now you can power up your alts to 'catch up' with the new baseline basically after a few weeks.

What do you guys think? Has carbine mentioned anything about this?

EDIT: WoW also has a raid 'nerfing' schedule which basically means they nerf the most current raid continuously every few weeks to ensure that all guilds are progressing.

1370457957.0,1fqkr5,A question for MMO Refugees: How much Wildstar endgame is enough endgame at release?,halfpastzero,17,3,147,"TL;DR - What endgame will wildstar need to satisfy experienced MMO players who are used to mature endgames?
****
Detailed Version - It seems most MMOs that have been release in the last 2-4 years or so are often berated and ultimately fail for ""not having [or enough of] an end game at release"". So I ask Wildstar fans

The problem I see is this. Most often the above complaint comes from players who are refugees from the big MMOs (i.e. WoW) and view endgame as small party dungeons and moderate to large party raids. They come from games that have had a half decade or a full decade to mature to games that are fresh off the boat. New games typically have a handful of end game dungeons and 1 or 2 raids. Technically these games are developmentally complete and are released to the public. Experienced MMO players, housing, PvP, daily style questing or some other unique activity.

As a metaphor

So my question to the community is how does an MMO developer such as Carbine counter that stigma of new games? Is it an issue with how games are developed or is it simply a mental block by MMO players acclimated to more mature MMOs with years of developed content? 

In my own opinion I think it's a little of both though I would weight it more toward an imaginary problem of the community. For example if Vanilla WoW,,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,True

I know they are looking for ways to introduce open-world PvP in a meaningful way without cramming it down our throats.  So I would really like to get a quests that throw us into enemy territories to:    

1. Assassinate X many Draken's or Warriors
2. Assassinate X many lvl 80 players of the guild ABC
3. Build a settlement in enemy territory and have it stay up for X many hours/days (Settler)
4. Scan enemy structures or enemy players (scientists)
5. Explore the following enemy city (Explorers)    

I hesitated to put the assassinate missions as soldier only because

Just to make sure this doesn't get lost in a sea of ""Not everyone wants to get ganked"": I am suggesting this, heavily satisfy the open-world PvP types (IMO) and add more depth/content to the Paths.  It makes a TON of sense Lore-wise.  The scientists would want to study the other cultures.  The settler would want to gain a foot-hold in enemy territory.  The soldier would want to be on the front line of the battle.  The explorer would want to explore these all new continents.  It also gives people who will be exclusive to a faction a reason to see these beautiful other areas they would normally not see.  I can't be the only one who found raiding another city and taking down their leader to be an absolute blast in WoW.  If you like this idea, comments and votes would be appreciated. I would love Carbine to consider this :)    

Even being on the opposite end of the bounties sounds fun.  Can you imagine chilling in a city and seeing a bunch of stealthy distortions moving in front of your face only to all assassinate a single player in the middle of the crowd who is /dancing naked?  What about calling up your guild to come to zone X because another guild was sent there to wipe all of you out -- massive guild battles.  Enemies putting up structures?  Call in /map to come start wiping them out.  I like those thoughts.  Also you can see a group raiding your city decked out in crazy looking epic armor and just be like ""holy sh**... run!""

So, as best that I can ascertain, look fantastic—I am very excited to get my Wildstar on.  

OK, I did have a question:

**For those of you who play MMORPGs with your significant other(s)

A little back story:

For my birthday, what we know of it thus far.  After showing her the *Get to know* the Dominion and Exiles video she seemed to be pretty interested.  To this day, (my birthday was late last month—that puts Wildstar on her radar for about the last month and a half or so) she appears to think that Wildstar is a pretty cool game and I think there’s a good shot in getting her into it upon release, which would make me (and her, I hope) very happy.  She’s not what I would consider a *gamer* but she certainly does enjoy playing video games on occasion (mostly Nintendo stuff, Mario et al.).

So

Thanks for your replies

**P.S. Bonus question: For those that have had the pleasure of playing Wildstar already

I only ask because she prefers them to playing games on a keyboard/mouse setup.

THANK YOU!

Rather than seeing a mount run by me while I'm adventuring, later on, developing into an interesting mini-game -- if Carbine were to put in a simple track I believe players/add-ons could manage unofficial races.    You could have ""plugs"" for your house/warplot with ramps and invite your friends for kicks.

This way, you would have to actively find a ledge/ramp and fly over the enemy aggro range (assuming it didn't extend vertically for a significant distance).  You could even use mounts to try and get air to get to new heights for exploring.  Super bonus points if it can be affected by explosions/abilities such that you could have some air, then have explodium go off under you launching you even higher, reaching places that would be otherwise too high to reach.  It would be even further enjoyable if it took a little skill to be good such as landing on a down slope continues speed whereas if you land on flat or upwards land it would lose a lot of speed.

Update: Just had another idea. **What if ALL paths had a role in creating structures like these?** What ideas do you have?

Keep on reading with caution. Have a nice day
----------------------
Good day hyped up peepz of the Wildstar reddit. I've been thinking. ALOT.
As in...Way too much. It's gone so far that all day long I hang around Wildstar's subreddit

So...I've been thinking. I really want to tank and the only game where I ever played a tank (MMORPG wise) is WoW. And I MEAN played - Highlevel content n stuff.

So...With W* we will only have SEVEN Slots

In WoW and some other MMO's there usually way a taunt so you can put yourself ontop of the current aggro first and you're guaranteed to be attacked for a few secs. Some games make it so your enemy has slightly raised attack for a few seconds but whatever.

So...That's 2 slots gone. In WoW I usually managed like 10-20 slots

That's 2+3=5. I'm a mathematical genius.

Why not more? Well

And that's it. You have a 3 key rotation of spells (which is a priority list of 2&gt;1&gt;3 since applying dots&gt;burst)

...That might come out as very bad gamedesign...To me, this goes too far into the MOBA direction, games like DotA or LoL, which I don't approve of. Yes we now have a rightclick autoattack, but will this really do? 

No room for debuffing etc. Or you'll have to have a 1-button-dps-rotation which would kill the whole purpose of the game for me...

~~~~€:Items and stuff will get their own Actionbar

I hope that this will work out someway or another

Have a nice day everyone.

This week I would like to talk about the Action Bar(s).

As far as we know, mostly the fact that there won't be much of a variety.

I'm going to make a comparison between two games

**World of Warcraft:**


In World of Warcraft, try to combine abilities in a way that it would be the most effective (PvP and PvE-wise), and be more invested in what they are doing.

The bad thing, they had to have multiple keybindings, it would make things just complex.

**Guild Wars 2:**

In Guild Wars 2, just to have more actions than just 10. The good thing about this system is obvious: it's simple, it's easy to learn, and it's easier to make combinations between your abilities.

The bad thing, while as in WoW, you had abilities to remove an enrage, magic effects, AOE, etc.

My questions to you are:

* What is your opinion on the current system?
* What would you like to see in terms of action bars?
* If you know any games that you consider to have the best system

I would love to hear what you think about it. ^^^^also ^^^^forgive ^^^^me ^^^^for ^^^^my ^^^^English",self,t5_2sqwc,1376147963.0,discussion,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1k0wkb/lets_discuss_the_action_bars/

While I do fancy upgrading my wardrobe and fighting bosses and human opponents

If we take a look at all the recent MMO's since WoW, the open world or arenas.

Is there any specific reason, expressed an attitude in such a way, that only PvP and Raids are the way to deal with progress?

I would really like to see something different, but will there be any visual upgrades to it - unlocking major things for player housing to an extent where this could be my only entertainment in the game?

Do we have something similar available? Something like major structures being build

I'd really like to see objectives, dams, bridges and the alike for the purpose of progressing the World instead of progressing your Character as the sole purpose.

&gt;World PvP. It is a term used to described going out and fighting in an open world setting in virtually most MMO's. The problem is

&gt;In WoW, but more than likely there's not much there. Sure there's the static Black Market Auction house with some PvP around it, and the occasional ganking here and there, but nothing really goes on in the other zones. And what does happen, is typically static and boring.
&gt;
In SW:TOR
&gt;
No one seems to get that there needs to be a reason to go out and venture into the actual World (and not just a bland set of daily quest hubs) to search and hunt on a weekly basis for something that isn't known. Search and Destroy missions where there is never a ""Guide"" or a pre-set place where something might show up.
&gt;
With the release of the new MMO WildStar, but only the word of mouth that will spread across the planet each week when you discover where some new tidbit to fight over has turned up.
&gt;
I didn't just come here with criticism
&gt;
**Weekly World PvP Zone Quests:**
&gt;
Have a quest that requires you once a week to go out and FIND where some NPC or group of NPC's are. I'm going to use WoW as an example as it is what I have played for over 7 years and know the best.
One week you'll have a quest to go to investigate Red Ridge, or $InsertZoneHere. While there, you simply fight for control of either some towers. Re-position them each day in the zone so even if you did the quest one day, you can't tell your friends where they will be in the zone the next day. This means everyone will have to scour the area to find out where the objective is.
The completion of this objective should provide substantial rewards to encourage people to actually show up and do it.
&gt;
**Weekly Travelling Escort Quests:**
&gt;
This one would be such that you'd have to go out and FIND where some NPC was in the world. They would never be in the same place twice
&gt;
**Make other quests like these...**

1345301694.0,yfgsy,[Concept] Role Trainer Dungeon - Single person dungeons to teach people and certify them to fill roles.,traemccombs,9,0,3,"So one idea I've had for a long time, and know that when they stepped in... with real people

- Concept

So the main concept is that you have dungeons people can zone into, get better and be certified to participate with other people.  This could and should cut down on a lot of the PUG drama that goes on due to people not really knowing what to do when they are tossed into a situation.

**Certifications**

People like to get certifications.  They like to earn badges that state they know what it is they are talking about.  ""I'm DLV Certified for all roles.""  [Dungeon Level 5 Certified]  Having this certification can make it easier for Raid Leaders to know that well

**Role Training**

Tank / Heals / DPS.   Each of these Sub-Dungeons would have varying levels of skills that people would learn.   Let's go with say 5 skill levels...

...and let's use a Tank as an example.  

Level 1 could be ""The Pull"" and ""Initial Aggro"" where you teach tanks how to establish aggro.   AOE tanking.

Level 2 could be taunt to re-establish aggro from an overzealous DPS.  

Level 3 could be survivablity and cool-downs

Level 4 Positioning, CC management and how not to break it.

Level 5 could be (tired.... insert some stuff here)

The point is

I'd like to think this could be gear neutral in that you'd be given a set of gear instead of using what you had.  This way you can cut down on variables.

**Conclusion**

In conclusion

PM me if you want me to elaborate more on this concept.  I know it's roughly laid out here and would actually like to talk to a WS Dev about it in more detail than just typing. :)

This doesn't only cut off this 'shortcut' thing
  
Well

But alas

Where I start to get scared is when they talk about stats.  This is a common practice of A-RPG games where they toss a random combination of stats, slot machines are addictive.  This also works in A-RPGs because content can be cleared very quickly and your chances at item drops goes up significantly.

What happens if we randomize stat pools on high-end raid gear?  I can see arguments on both sides.  Personally I think it might work if the min/max aren't drastically apart.  It gives you that drive to get a 'perfect roll'.  The problem

Perhaps the random stats won't be an issue.  I seem to recall that stat point re-allocation/balancing will be part of the crafting system?

Sorry if I'm making this out to be a bigger deal than it is. I always enjoy killing bigger and tougher enemies than me to test my skills and to brag about it. The broken mechanic makes it incredibly frustrating without adding much in the way of a challenge. Tera was a game that I think nailed the motion of combat nicely as a reference.

**1. Arena:** Yesterday we got to read about a new part of the elder game i.e. arenas. I really like the diversity of WildStar, Arenas, etc.). My concern is that people will rush the content to max level to get to arenas as soon as possible in order to get ahead with their arena rating (first come first serve). I want to enjoy my leveling process and discover/read as much about the universe as I possibly can, but I am afraid that the process will take too long and the ship will already have sailed for me to compete with pvp'ers who have already been doing arenas for a week or two. My suggestion is that upon release you delay the start of the arena season (which is probably the plan, I just wanna make sure).

**2. Stealth mechanic:** The Stalker class is the stealthclass as we all know. I am just wondering whether there is permanent stealth or not. Also

**3. Idea Skillshots:** (I am just calling them skillshots because of LoL). What I like in LoL is that you can keybind your keys (i.e. Q-W-E-R) to use a mechanic called smartcast

**4. Housing:** I am curious about the bonus xp mechanic in WildStar. By accumulating more stuff for your house you increase the bonus xp you get for resting in your home. Do you obtain enough items for your first character to make it beneficial or is this mechanic primarily for a second character? Is there a benefit for a max-level character in having this rested bonus xp?

**5. Beta:** Last point I promise. Lately more and more games have beta events before launch

Personally I'm not sure how I feel about it. This could be interesting or maybe not. Maybe it will be bad. I suppose it might be hard to tell before we know more about the game. Since I'm having a bit of trouble figuring this out I thought I'll open it up for discussion.

2. Nearly every race can access every ""role"". I don't mean like ""healer"", it'll just be a little more difficult than an Aurin. Of course, the Aurin would have similar trouble being strength based rather than Dexterity based.

So after thinking about this for a while I think I might have a solid theory on why we don't see any Female Chua around...

They are all in the hands of the dominion

From the lore it sounds like the Mechari found the Chua put some tools in their hands and told them to have fun and they built an entire civilization on destruction. Now after being elevated by the Mechari they ripped apart their home world and subsequently any and all forms of natural predators that they likely had. Suddenly the Chua, a whole planet to expand to and when you take away the only means of natural population control, getting eaten, the Chua filled the planet.

So after seeing what happens when you leave the Chua unsupervised they took measures into their own hands and captured all of the Female Chua and have been using them to control the population growth to manageable levels. This also allows them to selectively breed them to try and control the course of their evolution making them a more stable element in the dominion.

TL;DR the Mechari have all the female Chua to control the population growth of a race that fucks like rabbits",self,t5_2sqwc,False,discussion,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/WildStar/comments/1isiqe/possible_lore_based_reason_for_no_chua_genders/

What sort of things would you like to be able to do with a third party website? I was thinking things like maybe Guild management tools (say you can create and join guilds, and viewers could rate it based on the information (Like lolking does with champion guides.) maybe a forum section... etc

I'm not sure what sort of API wildstar is going to make available to actually query game data (which would be banging if anyone could give me more info.) But if that becomes available that could open up the possibility of doing some really cool stuff

One of the things that really made Vanilla WoW so...volatile, the banter, the imbalance whining. It was all very fun and healthy and in many ways created faction loyalty. Blizzard really destroyed that faction loyalty when they released Burning Crusade. Don't get me wrong, BC is still the best WoW experience I've ever had but for many reasons other than giving each faction Paladins/Shamans. 

So what does Reddit think about faction specific classes or paths? We still have lots of time for them to be potentially included if there's enough demand for them and I think that in a game that is going to have open world PvP and wants to include incentives to open world PvP

Often, as I play a support focused build, going through content like this will take me much longer than it would take him. 

Paths, explorers can have access to specific areas in zones. Anyone that is not an explorer will not be able to access these areas. So the problem occurs if one of us plays an explorer path, then often - we'll be separated, something I do not want. Explorer is a specific example of this problem but it can occur with other paths as well. So could there be any fix to this, aside from us playing the same path?

Perhaps to allow a character of a specific path to pull group members into their path exclusive zone, different paths have access to different things so ideally having a group with a mixture of different paths can help maximize the group's effectiveness.

The system let's you queue up as DPS, and a tank) and teleports you to the dungeon and ports you back when you are done. For doing this you are rewarded extra exp

I'm not here to say I want one in-game, and had an actual interest in doing them. Plus they all had to be located on your realm. I remember spamming ""LFG for (insert dungeon)"" for what seemed like an eternity in chat before finding anyone who was interested. This created a quick way to group with people across different servers and do dungeons, the extra loot/exp was pretty great too.

And herein lies the problem. Dungeon finder quickly became the preferred way to level for most people. This left most quest hubs pretty empty and almost made regular questing obsolete up to a certain point. It sort of became a race to see how fast you could get to level 15 so you could actually use the thing. You could argue that this gives older, which tends to get pretty boring and are almost pressured into using dungeon finder. As a result a lot of content in the game just ends up rarely if ever being used because of it.

Raid finder is whole different animal because my experience with it is very limited. Though from my understanding it looks like it can be pretty useful for those who aren't in guilds who raid a lot or don't have enough time to play with a dedicated raiding guild but still want to experience raiding.  


**tl;dr** Dungeon finder is a double-edged sword. It can be used to show a lot of content and level your chars quicker but you could also miss a lot of content as well.

1368653186.0,1eeqeb,Wildstar's Jeremy Gaffney Q&amp;A Responses,Gloryholez,9,3,1,"Full thread [here](http://www.mmorpg.com/discussion2.cfm/thread/385071/page/1)

**Q:How are holograms working against enemies on higher ground?**
A:IMO quite well.  Water/aerial combat is where they have the most trickiness (so we tend to disincent that

**Q:Can someone who hasn't recieved/completed the PreBeta survey back at february participate in the coming beta test two or stess test?**
A: Yep.

**Q:If so
A:Yep.  Troy's doublechecking this though

**Q:At launch or post lunch
A:currently on the post-launch plans

**Q:What will the language be for writing add-ons/mods?**
A: LUA.   Also

**Q:WILL I be able to pilot a space ship? (However big or small.) I've seen them docked in the yard
A:Space ships:  Actually we built the whole world intending for flight from day 1.  But there's a bit of a backlash in the community right now around flight trivializing content/making the world too small.  So we're listening to those debates right now

After this the thread got into a very heated debate on the pros and cons of flying mounts. In response to all the suggestions in the thread Jeremy had this to say: 

""Other alternatives include limited flight (via a gas tank on your speederplane or w/e)

**Q: What will your guild system be like? (I'm coming primarily from a WoW background
A: We do guilds

**Q: There's rumors that classes can only wield one weapon type (As in warriors can only wield two-handed swords
A: In general you get a weapon type per class

**Q: If I submitted multiple beta invites due to changing information (in a guild, part of a WildStar press project, etc) does that ruin my shot at beta due to it looking like I'm trying to artificially inflate my odds?**
A: We filter out duplicates so that doesn't help or hurt you too much

**Q: When it is going to be released ?**
A: As soon as we have fun

**Q: when are the last 2 races being announced??**
A: One of the races are such mischievous bastages that we're pretty sure they're trying to announce themselves against our will.
Next few months in all likelihood!

**Q:Can you give any information on how you going to cater to solo players at Eldergame?**
A: Sure:  Short form is we're aiming for at least one big dynamic area chock full of PQs and other solo/semi-solo content, and more.  Around the end of the summer we'll lift the veil on a lot of the elder game plans in detail so that it's not hand-wavey answers.

**Q: Can you have numbers in your name? What about special characters like spaces or dashes.**
A: At the moment there are numbers allowed in the names

**Q: Seeing some of the early beta footage from PAX, will it increase, and what are the development decisions behind this?**  
A: Yeah
The limited bar mentioned there is actually class skills, mount skills, class specials, etc.   We reduced the number of abilities IIR in those notes to add more Path skills (but my brain is fallible)
Our goal is to support as many abilities in the LAS as a skilled player can use without custom hardware (30-button mouses etc).  It turns out that while dodging, moving, jumping, etc. we were finding super low numbers of folks using even the upper ends of the bar.
So...will it change?  Probably, either through unlocking via the elder advancement system or otherwise so people can tune the way they want to play, but data and feedback will drive us (as through most things).

**Q: My question is more on the business side of Wildstar's development and Carbine Studio's creation.  It has been repeated multiple times that many of the developers that worked on Wildstar were former Blizzard developers.  And there has been comparisons made between Wildstar and WoW.  As somebody who greatly enjoyed WoW for many years
I would like to know who came up with the idea to start Carbine Studios. Additionally
Second question: So many games seem to release unfinished products, as opposed to games like Warhammer Online and SWTOR which were launched with a myriad of issues.
It feels like, it seems like the developers have the final say.**
A: The team was originally formed of about 20 seniors and leads off of the World of Warcraft team - but since then (we're now many years later and more like 220 people and growing) we have folks from EQ1/2, WAR, and probably most of the other western MMOs big and small.  And a good crop of noobs on their first MMO too (new blood is good too).
I was the executive (VP Product Development) on the NCsoft side who signed the team initially (with Robert Garriott, and big games want to go to Korea with a major partner) and honestly this was just the coolest project in the industry in my mind, so I joined here fulltime 4-5 years back or so.
Anyhoo I'm as senior as it gets in Carbine.  Within NCsoft I report to our CEO and our Global CEO and they are both gamers, even in a megacorp.",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,,

All i've seen in recent games is you have to be in raid to get the loot


For starters what if you have a few extra people in your guild to cover no shows


Say what you want at this point but thats really damn annoying. I've had that happen before and then never seen that piece of loot again.


Those also the argument of opting to sit so other people can have fun raiding, attendance, etc shouldn't you be able to join the DKP bidding war still? *Slap* That's right, you are outside the zone so no longer important. Well darn.


Also (and this is more aimed at Hardcore, people who were interested would bid, pay upto what you are willing (plat or dkp) winner logs out, logs in on alt and collects loot. 


If no-one wanted it on their alt


We'd still have a reason to raid because the plat made would be distributed throughout the guild, rare epic drop only mats, etc. So it was all still very beneficial.

From an alt point of view it was pretty awesome

So I would really love to see that players (maybe especially settlers) start to create a small settlement at a crossroad which other people add stuff to so it might develop to a major city.

Imagine a small settlement like goldshire in WoW becomming a big city of the size of Stormwind, taverns etc.) and the town develops, the craftings hubs get moved to a different spot to improve efficiency (smithy next to an ore mine, some fields a little outside the town with barns or w/e and so on). So in the end we have different quarters where people who were quick enough have their player houses.

Even more awesome would be if the enemy faction could raid cities and destroy stuff that need to be rebuild and fortifications added (e.g. big walls).

This will probably be a very difficult thing to implement because how will size be restricted

The 2 Archetypes coming will be 
Tank/DPS and Healer/Dps roles

For my first I stepped out of the box and went with a Ranged Tank since both the Warrior and Stalker are already Melee DPS/Tanks.

**Weapon** - Rifle?/Rocket Launcher?/Tech Gadget(Something like NES Power Glove)
	     Think I like the Glove Idea the most
**Skills**

* Plasma Rope(Tether

* Overshield(Reduce Dmg/Absorb Dmg) - Either Permanently Active Once Switched on but you do less dmg and gain aggro easier/ Or as an Active Skill with a CD Orrrrr could be the main feature of the class When used it affects the abilities of it's other skills

* Discharge(Looks like an Explosion of Electricity) - An Intterupt Skill does some damage

* Aoe Snare Type Move (Your Weapon looks like its Malfunctionning then explodes with plasma blobs flying around) - Blobs drop on the ground and has a Stacking slow/dot debuff as enemies run through them.

This would be on a week to week (or however long the raid reset cycle is) basis. He mentioned that during a particularly difficult week, but the top guilds would still be able to compete to see who could do it the fastest for extra loot.

Originally when I heard this, with all the WildStar hype, I was reminiscing about WoW, and watched a lot of the famous world first boss kills, and thought about where and how WoW went wrong with raiding.

One of the major downfalls of raiding in WoW, and later, Raid Finder. Not 10 man-specific raids, like Karazhan (or the 20 man raids in Vanilla), but 10 man versions of 25 man raids, and heroic versions for 10/25. All of it is good for having more people experience the content, but at the cost of the content's integrity.

Look, on January 16th, 2007. Yes, you had to attune for Karazhan, clear Karazhan/Gruul/Magtheridon to attune for SSC/TK, but even with all that, the first boss went down in TK on March 11th, and Vashj didn't go down (legitimately, Kael'thas

To me, when I was in middle school and had no idea what I was doing or what raiding even was, I remember when Trakanon first went down, there were parties and shit to celebrate.

That feeling is lost when you make trivial versions of the encounter for the sole purpose of having people experience the content. At least the Lich King on normal was slightly difficult. But even then, however, was Deathwing, who was patched in simultaneously with the Raid Finder, allowing anyone and everyone to mindlessly slaughter Deathwing one week (they held the encounter back a week from raid finder, lol) after his release. Literally anyone could just go kill Deathwing, father of Nefarian and Onyxia, leader of the Black Dragonflight, as the mystique and epic quality is completely removed by easy-mode versions of the same content.

So, is the variety/innovation of random elements in raids worth having boss encounters trivialized when the randomization makes it very easy?",,False,self,t5_2sqwc,False,explorer,

Will the visual representation be enough that we can spot them from a distance and chase them down or more of a if there is a pvp fight you would be able to recognize them without having to read nametags above the characters?  Also cross faction communication

I'd love to hear some discussions on the merits and limits the community feels this feature needs.  I'd hate to find out that the current implementation results in lots of griefing and it gets tossed rather than retooled.

Personally I have fond memories on Tallon Zek in Everquest talking with opposing guilds.  We knew who our rivals were and in some of the mass multi-guild battles it would be nice to be able to pinpoint our favorite target and smack them around a bit.  I'd like to see maybe a brighter nametag or a bolder print for a rival in game

I could see rivals being used in a reverse situation where players would rival a griefer to try and give them a heads up that they are coming.  This could especially be the case if the distinction a rival has makes them easier to spot at a distance.  Hopefully none of that is the case or it would become mandatory to rival most players.

I haven't been able to get too much into GW2 lately but started playing some yesterday.  I noticed a few guys at the dynamic event that had some extravagant

The reason I mention small differences such as size, Unity).  This opens up the variety of loot greatly with very little investment.  I like uniqueness, it would reeeally get me motivated for the 40-mans.  It can also increase the replay value as many people feel obligated to get that piece of gear that is just a little bit better, different or neato.

I still remember being deflated back in WoW when I got a super-awesome drop at the end of a raid

While on uniqueness

Does anyone else have an opinion on loot variation?  Different methods of easily implementing variety?

--------------
Since the Carbine folks seem to read these forums and there were very good comments

*Too many RNG loot elements could be overwhelming

*""Flair"" effects would be a good niche role for crafting

*Epic

*Some would rather not sacrifice noticeable performance for varied visual effects

*Could cause some to roll need on an item just because of its looks

*It would be a bummer to get an awesome drop but not use it due to appearance -- transmutation ftw.

---------------
EDIT: Gaffney has spoken on this:
How about gear?

We think it's funny that you end up seeing lots of people standing around town with the same gear on in the endgame. The greatest differentiation should be at the high level. For us **that means randomized elements on equipment**

Was hard to keep two copies in sync

*****


To me one of the fundamental aspects which keeps a game going

In several games i've played quite often i would log in to do something, I find that there is  a distinct lack in tools really that help you keep the social aspect in line. Some games have some tools, some have none, and some ofter a poorly designed set of tools that really helps noone - just the tagline  on the game ""LOOK! Our guilds have shiny tools!"" So I figured i would offer some ideas and considerations, and adjust them based on comments and feedback, and perhaps! by some miracle a dev might pass them on to  the social team in the game. Not saying my ideas are the ultimate ideas that MUST be implemented, rather they are mine (and the commenters below) ideas on what makes social interaction work better.

There are 2 important parts to this: General Play and Guilds (nomenclature might change per game

******

@
###GENERAL PLAY 
@

**/ignore or /ignoreaccount**

Automatic timestamping and easy commenting are critical i believe. Now some games do this

Further, and that should that particular toon be deleted, the account ignore should remain somehow. Perhaps a legacy line in the ignore list. Something along the lines of: CharacterName | Datestamp | Reason (and then should that toon be deleted, the charactername in italics). Either the server can track the backend of those legacy ignores pretty easy, or the client can (which is probably better for overhead).

SUGGESTION: /ignore NAME &lt;reason&gt; 

RESULT: The entire account of NAME gets added to ignore list

**/reportbot**

Spam, etc.

SUGGESTION: /reportbot NAME &lt;OPTIONAL COMMENT&gt;

RESULT: The entire account of NAME gets added to ignore list

**/rate /karma /dogma**

From a skill perspective - being able to give a player a ""karma point"" or some such based on good play. And of course

And yes,  scores would normalize over time, allowing players to recover from abusive bumps. Having a skill rating is actually a social issue, as poor play can ruin gaming sessions through the ensuing waste of time and drama it can cause.

From a social perspective - when you come across many players in the game, and then often just move on. You meet them later in the game and have a vague suspicion you might know who they are, but  you cannot be sure. And of course this works both ways - it can be a good or a bad past experience. What would be nice would be a way to keep track of such simple things in game to help in the future. A simple 1 -5 scale would work nicely. 1 being an ""avoid"", with 5 being ""helpful"". The end result is that anytime they chat/whisper in game, their name is highlighted in some way accordingly. Either a  (1)-(5) at the end of their name, or their name is color coded (red &gt; green) depending. This allows for instant recognition and building of a better social base.

This is purely a personal viewpoint of the player. *None of this information and ratings get shared with the server

Of course all of this would be on a toggle to view or not. My personal preference is their social rating to show in their chat stamps

SUGGESTION: /rate NAME (1-5) || /karma NAME || /dogman NAME

RESULT: NAME gets added to your social list

eg. BARRENSCHAT: FrodoLegolas(2): Snarf.

**/callGM**

Something as simple as this that would highlight public chat and ping a GM to look at it. So much extreme anti-social behaviour goes by because players know no GM ever looks at public chat. Perhaps if there was a  threshold - 10pings in 5 seconds - or some such

******

@
###GUILD
@

**Information**

Every game with guilds has some form of a Information field. Guilds pack all sorts of info into this

Now some of the fields (like /facebook etc.) are optional and most guilds won't use them

/info /motd /officermotd

/voicetype /voiceip /voiceport /voicepass

/website /facebook /twitter

**Comments/Crafting**

Adding a column for what craft/level a player is

**Ranks**

Allow ranks to be reordered. Not have to move players en masse up and down. Allowing a default rank to be assigned.

**Filtered Logs**

Allow the guild log to be filtered by useful information.

BY: achievements, etc.

**Guild Temporary Mute**

A simple feature that allows the GM/Officers to /mute the guild (except for officers) to allow for guild meetings (or to put a temporary end to drama ensuing).

**Automatic Alt Tracking**

Have characters automatically sort in rank by their other characters. So when you see a person's name in the guild list, demote or remove someone and all their alts. This can be taken further and have each player pick their own &lt;MAIN&gt; character  (changable of course by the player) to help ensure a lack of confusion in chatting. 

eg. Bob is online

eg. GUILDCHAT: Bob (a/Marcus): Hello all

******

More to come as it occurs to me.

__ 

To clarify I want to go over some of the lore. Feel free to correct me on anything which I may get wrong as I'm not so ""hardcore on the lore"" but I've read what I can. 

Originally all ""Humans"" where Cassians as they all lived together on planet Cassus. Until harsh polices where made which caused civil unrest leading into a large part of the population rebelling against the Dominion. ( http://bit.ly/19yswAk ) This rebellion eventually lead some of the Cassian people to flee the planet Cassus and seek help to fight the Dominion. Thus we have the Exiles. 

This makes the Dominion out to be the ""bad guys"" and the more evil of the two factions. As is the way with a lot of MMOs. I usually like to play the ""good guys"" because usually they're the underdogs and are fighting for a good cause. With Wildstar I was conflicted because originally I figured that the Exiles where the good guys who are fighting for survival from the Dominion. After reading up more on both factions I decided that isn't necessarily the case! 

IMO I think both sides have their bad and good parts to them. Trying to focus purely on the Cassians and Humans, became emperor and we all went onto rule over most of the galaxy. Cassians where under a great threat but weathered the storm and came out on top. 

- This is where I'm unsure about

For the Humans we know that 'as the Dominion's power grew

I think for me I need to know more about the reasons behind the rebellion before making a decision. And more about the leadership of the Cassians on planet Cassus before the rebellion happened! Hopefully we get to see some more lore before release.

I have followed this game for 4+ months now after hearing about. I am very excited for it to be released as I have been looking for a game to replace the feeling I got from playing Vanilla WoW (thru BC). After watching the videos and reading dev comments in /r/wildstar I am certain this game will restore the joy I once had for MMORPG's.

The thing that gets me most excited is the fact that Player Housing + Sandbox elements will be implemented in the game. The only thing that kept me around Star Wars Galaxies(Until SOE ruined it) was the fact that I made my own story, warplots and these plans being used in this game, I hope the devs will use one thing that I think SWG got right: Player Housing, Guild Halls, Cities. I realize a lot of the elements that were available in SWG were mainly Sand Box oriented but I feel that guild halls, player housing, city halls, and bases were done amazingly and really brought groups of people together and kept them around. 

This game has so much potential and I am excited to try it out regardless of the Housing + Settler situation but I hope instead of just improving existing developments and pvp elements we will be establish our own outposts in permitted areas.

I think the main reason for this is because of the horrible decision most MMO developers make to put everything in instances

Sadly

In EQ1

I think it would be great to have this type of mob system in the world. Don't make it so instances/raids/currency turn ins are the only way to get good loot. Put stuff in the world that will give people a reason to go exploring in it. 

Also, before instance dungeons came out). Basically, world zones that are as difficult as instances. This makes the world super challenging, fun and rewarding, and also promotes community interaction because you will most likely have to group to farm stuff. Though with the right amount of skill, it is possible to solo farm (I remember solo kiting mobs in the PoP zones on my necro, was a blast).

Sure, you'd easily pull aggro and die.

Haven't seen a game built like that since then, and no reason to leave town. 

This also has the added effect of killing any hopes of good world PvP since nobody bothers going into the actual world...which really annoys me since PvP is something I usually focus on.

I believe that companies should have the technology and power to build worlds big enough to accomodate large population servers and not have everyone overstepping each other and constantly fighting for mob camps. The hard part though is to make it small enough so the world doesn't feel empty

Either way though, and challenging fights...people will go into it. Instances do nothing more than take people out of the world and into a private hole. A MMO focused on instances feels more like a diablo2/3 type of game than an immersive, massive experience.

At least

* Halls of the bloodswarn (attack/ defend)

Right now i can think of a capture point game where each point is on a different asteroid in space and capturing certain points adds certain additions to your side in the match. Plus since the match is going on in space all of the points can drift and move around. The match would be on a 15 to 20 minute timer and at certain interval of if a faction captures  all of the point one of the bases could explode and be destroyed.

Competitive Dungeons

An example would be a dungeon that is composed of 3 sections.  Each section contains 3 distinct paths the join together at intersections. When a team enters a path
The reason for three paths is to allow for variation.  For example the difficult and obstacles of three paths may change each game.  Further each paths could vary risk/reward.  For example one path could be short but contain a miniboss with good loot.  One path could be long but only contain trash mobs

Do they wait in ambush at an intersection

                                 o  start
                               / | \
                               \ | /
                                 o Intersection
                               / | \
                               \ | /
                                 o Intersection
                               / | \
                               \ | /
                                 o  end
                    
The intersections allow the teams to collide in PvP with potential mobs adding to the chaos.  To win a team must have all members within the end zone first.  

To complicate things

I think this would be fun due to the constant tension of needing to be quick at PvE and competitive at PvP.  Further by having multiple different paths through a dungeon and new opposition each time

Am I the only one who gets annoyed when Crafting needs higher level items as you skill up and then you never use lower level items anymore. Like in WoW for example in WotLK you would only need Frostweave while levelling your profession after 350. Or to make my opinion clearer: You would only need materials only from the zone you were in. 

MMO's should encourage people to travel and explore. Like when you're max level you could need a really rare ore/herb/leather from a starting zone. And also the Market (Auction) would be always fresh and so. Epic Crafting Gear would make you travel all around the place so you really deserve them. Like you could also need stuff from dungeons

The Nexus Telegraph actually prompted this post and I got a bunch of ideas from what Eliot posted there:


**From Nexus Telegraph**

*""Of course, and it shouldn't be immune to wear or damage. In hilly territory, you might be better off taking a ground mount because there's nowhere to land that hovering beast outside of a handful of ports. It should provide recon opportunities, definitely, and some speed increases, but flight should never be trivial and easy.""*


I posted a sort of mish mash of ideas in response on the website but I wanted to organize a few of these thoughts here and talk about some pros/cons of flying and things that can be done to solve these problems and/or alternate solutions:

------------------------------------------------

**Flying**


**Pros:**  

 - It's fun!

 - It allows access to cool areas and some great views

 - Allows for quick travel to locations you've travelled through before

 - Opens up lots of cool world opportunities

 - Fits in with the idea of a Space Frontier very well 


**Cons:**

 - Can mess with PvP by letting people AFK in the air / escape easily

 - Trivializes jumping puzzles and exploration

 - Can make areas antisocial as players afk in the sky alone waiting for groups / etc.

 - Can break immersion if not implemented properly.

 - Can be abused to farm gathering nodes without any risk (or find nodes that are less risky)


 
If you have anything to add on the pro and con list

-----------------------------------------------

So

1. **Gliding**:  Players would have to jump from high locations


2. **Fuel Restriction**:  Gas tanks


3. **Landing Pads**:  Adding launch/landing pads in towns, and having them made by settlers would allow only certain areas to be landed in. Landing outside of a landing pad would crash land your plane damaging it.

____3A.  **Alternative Idea:** Launch Pads and Landing Sequence: So, flat area in order to land. This would make flight more than a glorified taxi service by allowing you the freedom to land anywhere that is a wide open space, but doesn't allow you to land on top of mountains or in narrow spaces (which they can make for jumping quests). This would allow more freedom without making it so you can take off from anywhere. (Except with the use of the Skyhook).

4.  **Aircraft HP/Durability**:  Adding a HP/Dura factor to aircraft would be nice in conjuction with a system that allowed air combat, but you would have to dish out cash to repair it later.  Do it too many times and it breaks and you have to really dish out cash to repair it.  

5.  **Aerial Combat**: Playing on the HP and Landing pad ideas

6.  **Air Beacon**:  (credit to francis775)  Every 30 min to an hour you can call down your craft to your location and beam/hook your way up to it (THINK HEARTHSTONE).  Probably would have to be used out of combat

7.  **7.Ship Building Mini Game:** Added this one on the end because it would tie in really well with the above ideas. Basically you construct your aircraft from parts crafted and gathered across the world to make a custom vessel. Combined with air combat you could mount various weapons


------------------------------------------


These are just a few of the ideas that have been accumulating in my head reading over discussions about flying.  If all of these were implemented it would make for one really awesome system in my humblest of opinions.  I know that Carbine has stated they are considering all the options

While WoW seemed to add Flying mounts later on, synergistic part of the game.

I just wanted to share some of the ideas I had, as long as they aren't chucked in WoW style and are thought through.

So let me back track in time abit. Back I the day when you wanted to join a Dungeon you use to sit in general chat spamming LFG and then LFG Q was invented to get rid of all the spam and make everyone’s life so much easier. Then SWTOR came out without said feature and everyone felt like it was so far behind times. Now days we are still spamming ""Looking for Guild"" and many years have past and the whole concept is scary that nothing better in social features have came out. Now the last thing I want is facebook in my game (please god no) but with the promise of 40 man raids for the HARDCORE


So with this I hope WildStar will have something in mind. I think guild advertising in game is a great way of achieving this. Adverting space for guild could be made available and recruitment systems to help players find guilds that play the same time periods as them self on the same day with the same interests. Whatever systems are in place I'm hoping to see something’s that really helps players find that guild and for guilds to find that player.


Just not facebook or Match.com for guilds ^^.

I was instantly reminded of vanilla WoW and all the good memories but then I also started thinking how 40man raiding will influence game/encounter design and how it will affect the rest of the game.

It is obvious they are trying to appeal to the old school WoW crowd

Let's look at vanilla WoW, it wasn't as polished as it is now and whether people admit it or not what made those encounters challenging wasn't the boss mechanics, it was trying to organise 40 people and coordinate them.

As WoW evolved raids allowed the players to focus on mechanics of the fight rather than have to worry about getting 40 people together

It's been years now and vast majority of players are used to not having to spend too much time organising a raid but working on bosses.  I myself did enjoy vanilla but past is in the past and if you try to recreate something it's not gonna feel the same.  Of course the 40 man raids will appeal to the minority just like they did in vanilla WoW and a lot of people are gonna say 40man raids were the shit they felt epic but think about it objectively. What will that mean for the game tho?  Are we gonna see a large number of people just stop playing resulting in wildstar's failure?  I hope not

Of course we haven't seen any of their encounter design yet and these are just my initial feelings on the matter.

1372270013.0,1h4ffi,Question regarding movement/gameplay,Alkzn,2,2,8,"So I've been playing WoW since it launched. But in the last few years I've been looking for a game to replace it. Mainly because I want something new to explore as I know WoW way to well and get bored pretty fast with it now. 

I'll start with saying I've been into arena the last years

So my question is regarding the movement and general gameplay. 

When I've tried other games I've really missed the smoothness that WoW offers (you will know what I'm talking about if you have tried WoW). I hate that some games have abilities that makes your character stop and do an animation that interrupts your speed or direction.

Its also important that the game reacts to what I'm doing. When I played games like SWTOR and Neverwinter it felt like the character didnt want to do exactly what I tried to tell him to. Trying to explain it as easy as possible. 

If you dont get what I'm asking about

Mainly I'm looking to know how the movement works

I hope to get answers from people that have played wow

Thanks for reading. 

ps: I heard something about there might be 2v2 

Hope this is a game I can try out.

Will the drops be some form of tokens

Have they confirmed any form of group finding tools?

1371266117.0,1gdq4r,Idea's for WildStar!,duganhastenstein,2,2,4,"    During WoW raiding the guild I was with would use a calendar to of course schedule the raids. This also helped to see who was actually going to make it and if they couldn't who would replace them. 

    Along the theme of calendars is the holidays in the game. From WoW you had the basic holidays like Christmas and Halloween but with different names. I would like to see completely new holidays with random dates/weeks. The other idea on this is to have liberation week/empire (probably different name) week where each faction gets their own week of pvp/pve boosts. 

   My final idea is interactive fights. This may(probably)be hard
