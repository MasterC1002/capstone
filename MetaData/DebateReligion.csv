1356431721.0,15f0kr,[Meta] I believe DebateReligion is becoming a circlejerk.,Natefil,207,62,371,"I would like for you all to consider what I have to say before agreeing or disagreeing with the topic I'm bringing forward.

I believe that the comments in reply to ""To Christian"" topics that reach any degree of popularity follow a very straight forward format and I believe that it is not conducive to discussion on the topic. 

I am going to give a few examples for you to consider from the last few days and I would like for you to just scan through them independently and see if they match up with what I'm saying. Again

[To Christians: Why would God have sent his son to die? How does this action cause humans sins to be forgiven?](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/15cnp8/to_christians_why_would_god_have_sent_his_son_to/)

I'm going to hold off there for now because there are so many smaller posts to wade through that I'm taking too much time.

There are several ways that these types of topics are addressed and the most upvoted comments follow a basic format:

* Short (no indepth analysis)  
* Written by someone who does not adhere to the belief in question  
* Often condescending  
* Often framed as ""Good luck finding Christians to answer this"" or ""Here comes the cognitive dissonance"" or ""Now watch as they justify condemnation of all unbelievers.""

I may have a skewed view of this but I believe that when a debate starts downvotes should be rare, or other such horrors.

I believe this is the best route to take because when positions are stated there is very little justification that can be provided for *any* viewpoint.

Let me give an example of what I think you'll see in topics (the hell ones especially):

The ""inquisitive"" submitter asks Christians to justify some aspect of the faith that appears to be immoral.

The top comment says something like ""Well

This receives many upvotes because it's easily digested and fits into a preconception that most of the readers already possess. Note that such comments will not really address the topic and that the person making the reply will not be able to elaborate because they don't actually follow the belief system in question.

A few more posts will be made of similar nature.

Further down someone from the faith will mount a defense. This will be met with a good number of downvotes and people will defend such downvotes for several reasons including 1) The reply didn't provide a sound enough response. 2) This is a cop-out. 3) The person replying holds terrible views.

I would like to address these points.

**The Easy to Digest Post**   
*Why condescension and brevity are rewarded* 

* **I've reached the same conclusion, if anything, from the conversation, it gets upvoted because it fits the preconceptions of the majority of readers.

* **Inherent frustration leads to acceptance of condescension:** I frequent various political subreddits and the same behavior appears in those that we see here. People get frustrated hearing the same lines over and over again that they'll downvote anyone who expresses the opinions they hate and be condescending to that authority figure that they are at odds with (because they've had to be faced with what they despise so very frequently). So when someone is condescending the reaction by many people who face similar frustrations is to upvote because it fits a paradigm. But of course this is not conducive to discussion at all. 

**The Downvoted Answer**  
*Why the inherent frustration leads to offhanded rejection of juxtaposition*

* **Someone may provide a counter-perspective but the lack of time leads to downvotes:** You'll notice this if you're aware of it. Imagine you're in a subreddit that strongly disagrees with your position on a given issue. Someone makes a blanket accusation against your position so you decide to respond. You can't provide the whole justification for your position so you answer the question directly from your position. What unfolds is that people downvote you for not backing your position. Well of course you couldn't back your position fully, downvotes contrarian positions because the person holding their opinion has to make generalized statements at the beginning to save time and to start discussion. It may be that the position has no foundation at all or it may be that the position is of such strength that you convert after reading the replies. Regardless, at the beginning you have no way of knowing which it is without making unfair assumptions regarding the submitter.

* **The classic 'I disagree therefore I downvote' problem:** This is true of any subreddit, without given the opponent time to respond, assumes that there is no logical answer for their counter-argument.

* Our lives are miserable and evil
* We are pawns in a war between a god and an army of demigods (angels)
* When we die, tortured in a lake of fire.
* If we win the god’s favor
* We have a purpose. It is to be slaves to god. That’s right
* In some Christian sects
* In other sects, the exercise of your will is irrelevant except in your ability to follow arbitrary and peculiar rules: you may not masturbate, for instance, and you must avoid eating certain foods. You are free to obey god’s capricious whims, or not.
* Your god loves you so much that he will kill his own son for you. But there’s a catch: you have to believe that god is the kind of guy who would murder his own son (and worship him for it!)
* Your god is the kind of monster who would exterminate just about every living thing on the planet because they were wicked. But at the same time
* This god is not a moral being: he has advocated rape, slavery, and blood sacrifice. The purpose of these horrific acts? His glorification.

1372132783.0,1h0mh5,To all humanoid and other Jedi: Why does The Force endorse child-slavery and slave-racing and gambling and organized crime and smuggling and unfair labor practices and indefinite detention and murder of messengers and innocent soldiers and genocide and extra-judicial killings?,b_honeydew,151,47,99,"Why do you claim your scripture is 100% good and consistent and that the way of The Force is the truth? 

Your scripture is filled with inconsistencies and illogical storylines. So many films and books are arbitrarily declared ""canon"" and other ""EU""...which life form makes these decisions and on what rationale? So many ""editions"" are released with changes to the story...how could any logical life form in this Galaxy take seriously the idea that these events were inspired by The Force?

But worse yet

Your messiah was born to a slave-woman. When your prophet found the boy he could have killed the slave-trader and freed all the slaves. But instead he decided to endanger the child's life in a criminal racing enterprise run by none other than the Hutts -- the very embodiment of evil and corruption. Your Jedi Knights who could have wiped out the Hutts and ended a major source of evil in the Galaxy

Your messiah's mother was abducted and abused and killed by sand-people

Why did you not address the complaints of the workers on the moons of Naboo in a timely and respectful fashion? Are protests for better labor conditions deserving of military action? Why did the Jedi Council never address the issue of indefinite detention without trial of persons in the spice mines of Kessel? Why does the Jedi not once use military force against the Hutts and others to wipe out slavery in the Galaxy? The same Jedi Knights who defeated the Mandalorians could have stopped slavery at whatever the economic cost to the Galaxy. Clearly the Jedi have one law and morality for the people who must cower in fear before the

Your apostle Han Solo gunned down in cold-blood an innocent messenger who was only trying to collect on his master's debts. Versions of your scripture differ on who shot first -- another inconsistency. Still it was a situation that could have been settled without murder. No doubt tons of death-sticks and other illegal drugs were smuggled by this Han Solo and have destroyed many lives yet you call him a hero.

Why your 2nd messiah Luke was attempting to escape from the Death Star, instead of killing them.

Why did the Rebels not give a 1-hour warning to the soldiers on the Death Star so they could have evacuated it before it was destroyed? There were many innocent civilians and Rebel prisoners aboard who could have been saved. If The Force is all powerful why couldn't it have transported all the Rebel prisoners down to the moon of Yavin? Why was there a victory and medal ceremony afterwards with no mention of the innocent lives lost?

Have you ever consulted with people of the Galaxy and attempted to modernize your religion? What is the use of holding on to 10

A simple question a child could answer is is that if Light Side of The Force exists then why does it allow oppression and suffering. Either it can't stop or it won't stop it. In either case the best you can say is it is useless to The Galaxy. But it has also shown itself to be immoral

It seems to that the Sith are much more logical and consistent and practical in their teachings. From my point of view the Jedi are evil.

1362172754.0,19hhmp,To atheists: A list of logical contradictions inherent in common theistic claims,GoodDamon,126,29,180,"I'm going to try something a little bit unusual, but I'd like to include contradictions in non-Christian arguments as well.

My goal in doing this is simple, but actually just moves the contradiction to another topic. **I want that to stop**. I want to force theists to examine their belief structures **as a whole**, and see if they can resolve all of the contradictions therein simultaneously, rather than constantly shifting the focus from one fine point to another.

To that end

This will be a skeletal framework starting with just six of the most common logical contradictions I've recognized

And theists? I would like to challenge you to escape **all** of the contradictions this post will eventually contain.

---
Part 1: The contradictions
-
---

1. **The omnipotence paradox** - There are things God logically can do that contradict each other.
2. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - Omniscience entails determinism
3. **The perfection paradox** - Why does a perfect being want or need anything? Why does a perfect being create imperfection? Is it even logically possible for imperfection to arise from perfection?
4. **The Euthyphro dilemma** - Is it good because God says so
5. **The logical problem of evil** - An all-powerful and perfectly good god is contradictory to the existence of evil and suffering. Also: The evidential problem of evil.
6. **The creation paradox** - Who/what created the rules by which God abides? Also: Who created God?


---
Part 2: The claims
-
---

**The Free Will defense** -- In response to the logical problem of evil.

*Summary*: It is logically possible that a greater good is served by the existence of the free will to choose evil or harmful behavior.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - On its face
2. **The omnipotence paradox** - The Free Will Defense implies that God is incapable of improving upon his imperfect creation
3. **The perfection paradox** - Why did God create beings with imperfect willpower to resist temptation? There is no logical contradiction in including in his creations libertarian free will and the perfect willpower to always choose good.

---

**Argument from objective morality** - In response to the logical problem of evil.

*Summary*:

There are objective moral truths. God is the only logically possible source of these truths. The logical problem of evil fails if there is no such thing as evil

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The Euthyphro Dilemma** - God is not actually a logically possible source for objective morality. Objectivity means ""true regardless of a subject's individual feelings, imaginings, or interpretations, then morality arising from him is subjective.
2. **The creation paradox** - If God is an agent that is capable of feelings, then any truly objective morality that exists would come from somewhere else. Where?

---

**Omnipotence definition argument** - In response to the omnipotence paradox.

*Summary*:

Atheists are going off a bad definition of ""omnipotence."" Omnipotence means God is capable of anything logically possible that it is in his nature to do. God can't make square circles or perform other logical absurdities.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The creation paradox** - From whence did this law of logic that restrict's God's power arise?

---

**False dilemma argument** - In response to the Euthyphro dilemma.

*Summary*:

The Euthyphro dilemma is a false dilemma

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The problem of evil** - Responses to the problem of evil and to the Euthyphro dilemma are ultimately viciously circular with one another. If goodness is defined as ""conformity to the nature of God
2. **The omnipotence paradox** - Per common modal logic arguments, then we have reached Divine Command Theory, which falls upon the horns of the Euthyphro dilemma again.

---

**First Cause argument** - In response to the creation paradox.

*Summary*:

God is the very first cause. He is perfect, and fully actual. Only such a being could stop the vicious regress implied by causality. Logically, a First Cause must exist, and it must have the attributes we commonly describe God as possessing.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - Setting aside the question-begging of the First Cause argument
2. **The perfection paradox** - A First Cause implies that there was a ""time

---

**Humans brought about their own imperfection** - In response to the perfection paradox.

*Summary*:

God is perfect, and God did not choose it for us.

*Implied contradictions*:

1. **The omniscience/free will paradox** - This one is pretty blatant. Again

---

That's a start. It's by no means complete, that's where God hides... ;)

1344704704.0,y1xxo,To Christians: The Trinity and Blood Atonement are illogical and suggest Islam is the true faith,,126,34,261,"**Let's Talk about the Muslim view of Jesus!**

*Jesus

Muslims see the God of the Old Testament and the New as one God. The see Jesus as the Messiah

""Translation of the Holy Qur’an, reads, 

&gt;&gt;Behold! The angels said: “O Mary! Allah gives you glad tidings of a Word from Him: his name will be Christ Jesus

&gt;&gt;She said

&gt;&gt;He said: “Even so: Allah creates what He wills: when He has decreed a Plan,’ and it is!” 

In a theological nutshell, born by virgin birth to Mary (Maryam) and strengthened by the Holy Spirit. Muslims believe he performed miracles from the cradle, conveyed revelation to humankind in fulfillment of previous scripture, healed lepers, cured the blind and raised the dead, all by the will of Allah. 

They also believe Allah raised Jesus up at the end of his ministry. Muslims further believe a time will come when Jesus will be sent back to vanquish the Antichrist. Following this, but who in fact are astray. He will then establish submission to God’s will (again, the definition of Islam) throughout the world, live an exemplary life, die, and shortly thereafter will come the Day of Judgment.""

Brown

*Doctrinal Differences - the Trinity and Blood Atonement*

The difference is two fold:

1) The Trinity - Muslims believe only God is God. Jesus is the word of God, Following the Bible and Jesus, they believe that assigning co-equals with God is a great blasphemy.

""Indeed, etc.) possibly exist in one entity? (For example, Jesus is mutable, changing with age; God is immutable, never changing.) Why did Jesus Christ ascribe his miraculous works exclusively to God and not to any divinity of his own, if he was in fact a partner in divinity? And why did he testify to having received his gifts from God if he and the Creator are co-equal? (For relevant verses, see John 3:35, 5:26–27, Acts 2:33

Brown


2) Blood Atonement - If God wanted to forgive sins, why didn't he just forgive them? Why did he ""have to"" kill his son? Is he not all-powerful? Does he lack the power to forgive everone's sins at once the way he forgave several individuals in the New Testament and Old? 

God does not need sacrfice to forgive sin, shall humble themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their sin, and will heal their land."" 2 Chronicles 7:14 Practitioners of Judaism will verify that sacrifice is not needed to forgive sins

Although there are different variations in details, Muslims believe God raised Jesus into heaven and never lets true harm come to his prophets. Some believe that Jesus was criminally crucified so the evildoers could seal their fate in rejecting God's prophet, then God rose Jesus from the  dead and ascended him into heaven. Others believe God made a miraculous body double to suffer in place of Jesus, raising him in to heaven first. The point either way is that blood atonement is not needed. Christ was crucified by human evil, not by God.

I believe that Blood Atonement and the Trinity are both questionable, which is blasphemous. Muslims believe in the one God of Moses and Jesus, but believe, as is obviously true by the schism and bloodshed of history, that these revelations became corrupted and misused for political purposes. God sent a message to the prophet Muhammed (pbuh) to show the unchanging truth of one God, and re-establish the people of the earth in submission to him and to return to true worship and monotheism, challenging the pagan doctrines assigned to God by the Christian church.

*On Muhammed (pbuh) - His Mission and Authenticity*

As for Muhammed (pbuh), the fact remains that an illiterate Middle Easterner began spouting detailed Old and New Testament Bible stories.  He was illiterate, so he didn't have any access to extensive study of Hebrew or Christian scriptures, and no translation of the New Testament was actually made into Arabic until long after Muhammed's (pbuh) death anyway, and was only in the hands of the very wealthy then. Furthermore, if he were going to parrot oral stories to give himself authenticity, he would have kept roughly the same details - instead he changes the details and derives alternative theological explanations, and makes them explicit. Furthermore

As for Muhammed's (pbuh) lack of miracles, like Muhammed (pbuh), were warners and correcters. The revelations of Moses and Jesus were long ago corrupted by alteration, political intrigue, and bloody schism. God never leaves people without guidance - those who have open ears and hearts! There are more than enough signs in the Bible to believe in God, for those who will listen. God chose Muhammed to show the unity and clarity of God's revelation to people over time, and he chose to do it in a time in history when the words of God could be printed in a book and kept intact and secure.

Allah is the Arabic word from the same root as Elohim, and so on. Allah is the ancient name of God. This is not a different God being referred to by Muhammed - it is the same God as that of the Old Testament, the same God who sent the Messiah, Jesus, and the same God to whom Jesus cries out on the cross, the very same name. 

*Returning to the truth of revelation*

By considering the above, but is illogical and implies an unjust and cruel God, it would seem that Christianity does not represent the following of God and the prophets, but has gone astray. Furthermore, Christians suggest that those who reject the trinity and blood atonement, whether because they are illogical, unbiblical, or because they are a child born in a foreign culture

""However, the real Jesus in conflict with popularized notions, media profiles, and modern Christian teaching. Could Jesus be so contrary to personal and societal constructs that he will openly oppose the churches built around his existence? If so, then popes and priests, parsons and pastors, bishops and cardinals, ministers and messianic pretenders may all find Jesus condemning them just as he condemned the Pharisees in his homeland. In other words

&gt;&gt;Not everyone who says to me,” shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father in heaven. Many will say to me in that day, “Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in your name, cast out demons in your name

&gt;&gt;And then I will declare to them

Brown

**tl;dr** The main point of my argument regarding *any* theory whatsoever of Christian atonement is this: 

1. The common point of all Christianity is that Jesus had to die for some reason or another to do something or other for us.

2. In the Muslim version, who gave many signs and miracles urging repentance and submission to Allah, and then was ascended into heaven. The crucifixion and how it appeared to be can be discussed, fancied about, etc, but it ultimately doesn't matter. Why?

3. Because. **A God that *needs* anyone to die to make his will be in any way is neither all-powerful nor all-good.**",,t5_2snuc,1344726832.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/y1xxo/to_christians_the_trinity_and_blood_atonement_are/

1343870146.0,xje5f,To Theist Philosophers: Intuition is not a great tool for determining truth,Cortlander,108,17,240,"This post is aimed at a variety of theistic arguments

Let me present a basic example of why it can be bad. 

Premise 1: If I impart impulse into an object along its axis of travel

Argument:

1) If I impart impulse into an object along its' axis of travel

2) A photon is an object

3) If I impart impulse into a photon along its' axis of travel

Now this is an argument that, intellect and universe creation, our experiences with the everyday world may not apply. 

Lets look at the most recent example posted here: The Kalam Cosmological Argument (see [SinkH's infographic](http://i.imgur.com/31quP.jpg) for a truncated version).

For this post lets focus in on one quote in particular

&gt;The past cannot be infinite no matter how many universes there are. If it were infinite we would have to traverse an infinite amount of time to get to today

On the surface this seems like an intuitive reasonable assumption. 

However as is usually the case with intuition, time would collapse right along with it. If our universe collapsed right now, it would have taken in total, zero time. 

To go with the analogy in the infographic: imagine there is a number line starting at 0 (universe 1). And this universe ends at 5 on the number line. The ""next"" universe will not start at 6

Another way to put this is that time must be conserved across universes in order for there to be an actual infinite past. However the science of the big bang has shown us that this is not the case. 

As you can see

Lets look at another example: evolution.

In particular lets look at Plantigna's argument that naturalistic evolution cannot provide humans with the ability to form accurate beliefs.

Without delving too deeply into the argument

There is this idea that because evolution selects for survival foremost

This is often backed up with some example of complex animal cognition. Eg: A leopard could mistakenly think a cliff is actually a poisonous snake while another leopard perceives it as normal. Both would result in the leopards avoiding the cliff

The problem here is three-fold. First of all when we use intuition, escape, pursuit), it becomes clear that correct identification (useful in *all* instances) will yield better results then misidentifications which happen to be useful in one or few instances. This is an issue of thinking to linearly or simply.

The second problem is thinking only in terms of direct relationships. Eg: Either survival and correctness are directly linked

Such absolutes tend not to exist in nature. In this particular case, and most conclusions drawn from those senses should be accurate, most of the time (things like: Im sitting in a chair, Ow that burned me, etc).

And this is exactly what we find when we look at human intellect. Humans can't always identify a bird at 300 meters

And finally

In this case the problem is looking at a fully formed animal brain and asking ""how would it form correct conclusions."" This is jumping the gun. The correct process would be to look at a single celled organism and understand how it interacts with the world. Look for the issues you are claiming to find in the leopard brain in the single celled organism. If you don't find them there

Looking at an end product (like a human brain) and intuiting that evolution could not select for such a brain to be accurate is skipping all the intermediary steps which explain exactly how that accuracy arises. 


So in conclusion:

* Intuition is not a good source for supporting your premises when talking about certain subjects.

* Things like infinity

* Generally the problem with intuition is it invites equivocation and 'thinks' in too broad of strokes.


Oh and one final aside:

It is perfectly reasonable to say something like ""I find that much of philosophy is a useless venture."" Or ""Philosophy is a less rigorous form of mathematics.""

The usual response to this is ""But that statement *itself* is philosophical by nature"" and then that person leaves it at that

But they haven't. I never said all philosophy is wrong (which would be self-refuting) nor did I say that philosophy is *never* useful. Telling me that my statement is technically philosophy is a non-answer. It doesn't address my point

Eg: ""Philosophy is generally non-rigorous; many arguments get by because of the inaccuracies and tricks of our language"" 

""That statement itself is PHILOSOPHY!"" 

""Yes

----

In this essay I argue that pure faith is the worst possible source of beliefs

## Human minds are moral computers

Contrary to what some primitive religions claim, stress-free conditions, many animals show moral behavior such as [altruism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Altruism_in_animals), [empathy and reciprocity](http://atheistuniverse.net/group/avm/forum/topics/news-thread-empathy-and). We see stuff like defense of the weak, [fairness, and cooperation](http://www.livesofanimals.org/2010/11/02/monkey-co-operation-and-fairness/). Humans, of course

Non-[psychopathic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychopathy) humans, psychologists had trouble explaining on purely evolutionary grounds why [humans are even kind to strangers](http://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2011/07/31/why-are-humans-so-nice/) but [recent experiments](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2011/07/20/1102131108.abstract) help to explain this too.

While much of animal behavior is mostly reaction to their environment, a human's whole life can be seen as one instance after another of considering, planning and performing actions that lead to human thriving, welfare and happiness; mostly his own, but where possible also those around him.

All that said

Because of our ability for abstract reasoning, more secure... better. Actions we consider ""bad"" injure or otherwise harm people, or make them unhappy or insecure. [Sam Harris examines this in considerable depth](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKwxPh8iWJc). Modern societies, therefore, give a lot of thought to what could be done to ensure the well-being of people in societies. Animals too, while we're at it - they can feel too, so they should at least get some consideration. Popular awareness of moral issues keeps improving. We've meanwhile even assigned [stages to moral development](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_Kohlberg%27s_stages_of_moral_development). 

Getting back to the human brain: you could say it is a biological machine for observing its environment and gaining knowledge from it, humans would have been eaten by tigers.

## Garbage in

But apart from often working less than rationally thanks to its emotional component,_Garbage_Out). Given a smoothly working rational process, the ""best"" decisions require the best data, i.e. a collection of knowledge (or beliefs) that most closely mirrors the reality of the world. In general, *there is no set of incorrect, i.e. reality-defying beliefs such that a human operating on those beliefs can reach ""better"" decisions than on the most realistic beliefs available,* just like there is no alcoholic drink that will make us a better driver than being sober. If we accept that humans try to act in a ""good"" moral way

## The moral obligation to truth

William Clifford's essay [The Ethics of Belief](http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/w_k_clifford/ethics_of_belief.html) illustrates how it is every human's moral obligation to assure himself of the truthfulness of his beliefs. Highly recommended reading!

Alan Sokal says similar things in a different way:

&gt; If you are sloppy about evaluating evidence
The main point is … it’s important when you make claims about factual matters in the world

&gt; Source: &lt;http://colinmarshall.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=404357&gt; 

So if someone ignores or rejects the best available evidence -- or worse

## How to find the truthiest truth

How can we arrive at the ""truest"" truth possible, in descending order of reliability, are the methods of discovering truth, with summarized explanations:

1. **The method of reason.** Within the realms of logic and mathematics, a proof based on reasoning, unless it contains errors, leads with certainty to a solidly correct result. Alas, pure reason only works this way on abstract concepts. Out in the real world, we need other methods:

2. **The method of science.** Science is actually a collection of methods that take all the other methods of finding the truth and works very hard at quality control to achieve the highest standard of truth about reality attainable outside the method of pure reason.

3. **The method of experience.** ""Seeing is believing, that make one's own experience less reliable than experience validated by scientific investigation.

4. **The method of history.** If we can't observe an event ourselves, and that's the best we can do for past events.

5. **The method of expert testimony.** If we don't ourselves have direct access to sources of information

6. **The method of plausible inference.** If we have incomplete facts, extrapolation, and interpolation of evidence and facts is how this is done. Sometimes this is the best we can do, but where one of the above methods is available, we should scrap our results for those from the ""better"" method.

7. **The method of pure faith.** To quote Carrier: ""... refers to basing beliefs solely on tradition, faith in this sense is trusting what we are told, or just 'guess' or want to be true, without requiring any proof. In other words, believing an ungrounded assertion.""

The wording of this last and least trustworthy method of arriving at ideas about the world of course leads us into... religion. 

## The dubious truthfulness of religions

For the purpose of this discussion

&gt; *The belief in and worship of a superhuman controlling power

That handily includes the Abrahamic faiths

There is no way to prove the supernatural claims of religions, all religions break down to admit: ""**you've got to have faith.**""

In other words

Outside of pure faith, the [anthropology of religions](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropology_of_religion) yields strong evidence that religions (and their deities) are the inventions of humans:

&gt; In 1841

## Faith-based beliefs and their effect on moral behavior

Thus, especially when such claims contradict information that we arrive at by one of the other methods. On a basis of *false* beliefs we cannot act *more* morally than on beliefs based on reality. *Any* of the other methods of arriving at knowledge are better suited to yielding correct data than pure faith is.

So what happens when we accept beliefs on faith? Let's look at Christianity simply by expedient of it being familiar to me and a majority of readers. Here are a few examples

This view is still held [uncomfortably close](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/30/rick-warren-refuses-to-co_n_373605.html) to ""modern"" societies.

These are all beliefs that were held, and condemn them. So it's easy to see that, in this indefinite Christian past we're looking at,  beliefs held on faith led at least some people to act in ways we now consider immoral. All else being equal, people without these beliefs (at that time) would have acted more morally than those with.

## Where do our morals come from?

Many, ""evil"" ideas come from the Bible. Those of us who consider these ideas ""bad"" and outmoded are obviously not applying the Bible as a standard and source of our morals. Where, then, do our morals come from? Simply put, societies learn - often from what works and what doesn't. So in terms of morals, we've often applied methods 2-6 and kicked faith-based method 7. But having already discarded the Bible as an authority in many cases, why not honestly take the next step and discard it in all?

The Bible contains a few universally recognized morals, and it's meanwhile been refined into [Kant's Categorical Imperative](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative). Because of its few useful lessons, many Christians consider the Bible an invaluable moral reference. My guess is that this essentially comes down to lacking study both of the Bible and history.

## The future of morality

I think it would be conceited to believe that we and our societies have arrived at the pinnacle of moral consciousness. Rather, just as today's society condemns some of yesterday's Biblical morals, so will tomorrow's society condemn some of today's.

Why wait for this future when we can move to act more morally (and improve the human condition) today?

First we suffer the traumatic experience of being pushed through a vagina, 87 babies a day are born with a  coronary heart condition, 80 with a genital tract defects,  27 with cerebral palsy,  12 with downs syndrome, 11 with fetal alcohol syndrome and the list goes on. Over 121 children each day are born in America alone with something extremely wrong with them. That is 1% of the population blighted before their lives have been begun. Over 44,000 a year in the United States alone.

Assuming we survive being born, sickle cell anaemia , multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, Parkinson’s. These horrific things attach themselves onto us and kill us with remarkable ease and from the earliest of ages. The survival rate for living beyond the age of 16 was minute post medicine. 

And it doesn’t get better with age: beyond the age of 30, our vision slowly gets worse as does our memory. So not only can we not see, we forget the blurry objects. It makes Noah’s 950 year life span all the more impressive.

We’re the only species on the planet to suffer from epilepsy and a fear of the dark. To be fair, CO, CH4 and CO2 all have the potential to kill us and we can’t sense them without the aid of technology.  So you’ll forgive me if I don’t praise the eye as some wonderful creation of God.

None of this is helped by the numerous imperfections with a perfectly health body; our thumbs aren’t as good as they could be, our balance is terrible, our senses are stunted and I have managed to poke my own eye out before. What the fuck?

We’re extremely inefficient too; we exhale almost all of the oxygen we inhale

It astounds me that a creator would make our mouth the input source for water

Growing up I use to think people of other faiths were dits, agnostics, theists and everything in between. 

This is where I’m starting to see a problem. Atheism is on the rise and in a lot of ways it has established itself as the “rationale” belief (lack of belief) or the right way of thinking. I think with this sort of idea in the back of people’s head, I’m not saying this about all Atheists, just some. It’s funny because for the longest time, atheists have been the ones to call out people of faith as being blind and unable to think rationally but now I realize, as a belief system or way of thinking grows, no matter how rationale the idea may be, a lot of the followers will remain dits.

In the past few posts, misreading posts, pointing out/leading the discussion in targeted way, raising cliché points that have nothing do with the topic of discussion or simply saying zingers/ one liners that they know will get up votes.

(Bonus points to anyone who realized immediately that my equivocation was on the word ""bad"")

***

I'd like to urge everyone here to take a few moments and examine the arguments we're using to make sure there aren't any unintentional equivocations.

Equivocation is the use of a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways,"" am I referring to an incandescent source of visible light, or a bulbous plant start that doesn't weigh very much? Most people would assume the former without context, but if I take advantage of that by *implying* the former while actually *meaning* the latter, then I am equivocating. If I'm making a joke -- ""Is that a light bulb?"" ""No, it's actually a very heavy bulb!"" -- then that's fine. But if I'm trying to make an argument in favor of my position, then I'm undercutting myself and rendering my argument invalid.

Equivocations are **formal** fallacies

1. All *A* are *B*
2. All *B* are *C*
3. Therefore

This is valid

1. All *A* are *B(1)*
2. All *B(2)* are *C*
3. Therefore

This kind of fallacy is called *quaternio terminorum*

Now, I can only think of theist arguments that use this tactic. But that doesn't mean atheists don't make the same mistake. I've probably made it myself, and I'd prefer not to. Nevertheless, I must use a theist example here, although I'll happily edit this post to include an example of atheistic equivocation if someone could point me to one.

The theistic example I'd like to use is the formulation of the Kalām cosmological argument presented by William Lane Craig:

&gt; 1. Whatever begins to exist must have a cause.

&gt; 2. The universe began to exist.

&gt; 3. Therefore

Whatever one thinks of the second premise -- personally, the argument equivocates first by leaving out key elements that would clarify its meaning (and render P1 directly at odds with P2); and second by conflating two different meanings under the same word to produce a superficially valid syllogism.

If P1 is expanded to include what William Lane Craig has omitted

&gt; 1(b). Whatever begins to exist ***ex materia*** must have a cause.

""Ex materia"" means ""out of material."" In other words

This is what he means, William Lane Craig is able to move on to P2, where the other half of the equivocation lies. Again, let us include what he has omitted:

&gt; 2(b). The universe began to exist ***ex nihilo***.

Now, why didn't he just say so from the start? The answer, of course, is that even more so than with *creatio ex nihilo*, it is unknown and unknowable whether or not the universe could be made of something pre-existing. The premise is demonstrably unsound if he specifies *ex materia*, so he must hedge and say it ""might"" have been:

&gt; 2(c). The universe began to exist either ***ex nihilo*** or ***ex materia***.

2(b) doesn't work with 1(b). 2(c) hints at *ex materia* creation to make it superficially compatible with 1(b)

I recognize that I'm not single-handedly going to convince many -- or any -- regular theist readers here that William Lane Craig is arguing from formal fallacies. The most common defense I've seen is that it is valid to roll *ex materia* and *ex nihilo* creation into one. If you accept that

Now I'd like to open the floor to theists and atheists alike to discuss other fallacies of equivocation. I'm particularly interested in atheist equivocations, go ahead, but you're going to need a damn good reason to make *ex materia* and *ex nihilo* synonymous enough to validate WLC's syllogism. Now that I perceive a formal fallacy in it, it really does appear doomed to me.

2. George Bush is an idiot.
3. Therefore

How many different kinds of logical fallacies did you count in that argument? The answer: one, and what's best, you won't have to memorize a long list of named logical fallacies or need to know any Latin terms at all in order to spot the problems with the above argument.

To begin with the most basic atom of logic, it is a valid form of *[modus ponens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_ponens)*. Modus ponens is kind of reasoning you use most often in the real world and it takes the form:

1. If x
2. X is true.
3. Therefore

The basic rules of inference take very intuitive forms. For example

1. X and Y.
2. Therefore
3. Therefore

Addition:

1. X.
2. Therefore

Hypothetical syllogism:

1. If X
2. If Y
3. Therefore

Disjunctive syllogism:

1. X or Y.
2. Not X.
3. Therefore

These are just some of the general forms of logical inference

1. If Socrates is a man
2. Socrates is mortal.
3. Therefore

This inference is not valid because it does not satisfy any of the necessary forms of inference- it is modus ponens with one step backwards. This brings us to the first of the two major categories of logical fallacy: the *non sequitur.* All of the logical fallacies with names that you've heard belong to one of two and a half major categories: the *non sequitur, but we'll get there when we get there. For now, lets talk about the *non sequitur.*

As you've seen, you are trying to make it so that *the conclusion is true in virtue of the premises.* Since arguments have these two simple features, namely, premises and conclusions, the only way arguments can logically go wrong is for a premise to be false or for the conclusion to not follow from them.

(Note that if a conclusion ultimately does not follow from the premises

**The non sequitur**

The *non sequitur* is the subset of logical fallacies explaining why a conclusion does not follow from premises *even if all the premises are true.* In the above example, and C as venn diagrams, you will easily be able to see that there is no necessary overlap between them.

But this subreddit is about debating religion

1. Religion is evil.
2. Therefore

This is a *non sequitur* type you might call the ""appeal to consequences

1. The universe looks very complicated to me.
2. Therefore

You could call this kind of fallacy the ""appeal to ignorance"" or the ""appeal to personal incredulity."" The argument exposes its falsehood when you realize that, very odd-sounding premise like ""2. Whatever looks very complicated to me must have been designed by a preternatural superintelligence.""

1. Historically
2. Therefore

Call this a ""hasty generalization"" if you like, and a good rule of thumb is that, if the additional hidden or necessary premise sounds as odd as the examples I've given here, you've probably got a rickety argument on your hands.

The important point, *the names of the fallacies don't matter.* You might have spent some time looking at skeptical websites trying to memorize list upon list of fancy, Latin-sounding names, but this is unnecessary. Most of the time, the only thing you'll have to know how to say is ""that doesn't follow,"" meaning that there is a *non sequitur* afoot, or ""that premise is false, but you are just cluttering up the debate with terms that are unnecessary and that can be explained in plain language much more easily.

But if the conclusion does follow from the premises, your argument is *valid.* But what happens when you get an argument that looks like the original example, about George Bush and George Michael?

**Soundness and the false premise**

The next big hurdle for an argument to overcome before we should accept it is the hurdle of ""soundness."" An argument is ""sound"" only if the conclusion follows from the premises *and* all of the premises are true. Take a more religion-sounding version of a patently absurd

1. If Muhammed and Jesus walk into a bar
2. Muhammed and Jesus walk into a bar.
3. Therefore

It should be plain to anybody except ""[Jesus and Mo](http://www.jesus-and-mo.net]"" fundamentalist literalists that both of these premises are false: Jesus and Muhammed never walked into a bar together, and it means just like what it sounds like: whether the conclusion follows from the premises is irrelevant because at least one of the premises is false.

In the primordial argument about George Bush and George Michael, but there was no ""ad hominem"" in that sentence. The ""ad hominem"" is the fallacy I see being most widely abused in arguments about religion, not in that people use them too much, but quite the opposite: most people think the ad hominem is something that it isn't. For example:

1. If Averroes is insincere
2. Averroes is insincere.
3. Therefore

Now remember, and this argument is formally valid. But whether its premises are true or not is an *empirical question,* not a logical one- we need to actually know more about Averroes and his sincerity to figure out how much we accept this argument. Put another way, *not all insults are ad hominems* and *not all ad hominems are insults.* The *ad hominem* is any kind of false premise that extrapolates more from somebody's character than is warranted. To wit:

1. Adolf Hitler was a vegetarian who loved animals.
2. Anyone who is a vegetarian and loves animals is an alright guy.
3. Therefore

Now, single-term class of fallacies called equivocation.

Consider the following argument:
1. If men and women aren't the same
2. Men and women aren't the same.
3. Therefore men and women shouldn't be treated the same by the law.

Now this is an argument that *appears* to be valid and *appears* to have two true premises, ""the same"" seems like something like ""equality under the law,"" but in the first and third uses, ""the same"" seems more like ""biologically identical."" 

As is the normal test for a fallacious equivocation

1. If men and women aren't biologically identical
2. Men and women aren't biologically identical.
3. Therefore

Now the argument is still valid but that it is sound (namely that its first premise is true) now seems much more dubious, a bit of clever wordplay on the word ""same,"" to noodle your way into a position that, on further examination, is quite a bit less airtight than the ""sameness"" formulation suggests.

I put the equivocation in a kind of its own because it isn't *really* just a false premise, because usually when you find an equivocation, it means that the conclusion is being invalidly inferred from a premise that is false anyway, though in the above case it functions just as a false premise. 

[This example is borrowed from Anthony Weston's ""A Rulebook for Arguments

To sum up, remind yourself that you are really only trying to answer three questions:

1. Are the premises true?
2. Does the conclusion logically follow from the premises?
3. Are the terms in the argument being used consistently?

If the answer to all three is yes,"" then slap a ""disagree"" on that sucker because you've got yourself a ringer. If the answer to 3 is ""no,"" go with your ""clarify"" tag because something smells fishy.

**Kinds of arguments**

*1. The basic inference.*

For the purposes of very basic logic, I will call ""basic inference."" These are arguments that go like:

1. Premise asserted as true.
2. Premise asserted as true.
( and so on )
3. Conclusion.

Most arguments are of this kind because they are usually the only kinds needed

*2. The reductio ad absurdum.*

This is a term that you may have heard used before,"" but what it actually means is ""reduction *to* absurdity."" It is a kind of argument where you-

* take something that you want to show is false
* assume that it is true *just for the sake of argument
* show that something contradictory or absurd would follow from that something if it were true.

For example, very easy-to-understand demonstration of the three structural elements of the reductio ad absurdum. To wit:

1. Let's say God exists.
2. If God exists
3. But there are instances of gratuitous
4. So something's wrong here. Either God's existence doesn't entail that there are no instances of gratuitous

And that's the argument. The atheist would say that 4 shows that either God is not perfectly good (since his existence wouldn't entail a lack of gratuitous evil) or that God doesn't exist, I prefer my problems of evil not to go this way, but to [start from the suffering and look upwards](http://teapotatheism.blogspot.com/2010/02/simple-statement-of-moral-inadequacy-of.html), but you get the idea.) Arguments of this kind can be either very simple or very complicated, and you can probably see their close familial relationship with arguments of the normal logical type. 

The trick to these is to just remember the title: you are trying to *reduce to absurdity* some premise that someone wants you to accept; if a contradiction follows from something

*3. The conditional proof.*

These arguments are very similar to the *reductio* in that they begin by assuming something that hasn't been demonstrated

1. If you have treaties with the unbelievers
2. If they attack you
3. If you attack the unbelievers

This is a pretty complex series of propositions. The conditional proof is where you just throw in another premise *assumed to be true just to see what happens

Suppose that, then you should attack them back and not transgress limits:

1. If you have treaties with the unbelievers
2. If they attack you
3. If you must attack the unbelievers
4. The unbelievers attack you. [assumed for conditional proof]
5. You must attack the unbelievers. (from 4 and 2)
6. Do not transgress limits. [from 3 and 5]

Now

Seven. If the unbelievers attack you, 5, and 6]

Note that this does not say that you must attack the unbelievers and not transgress limits

The conditional proof, or just in case your argument is very complicated and needs clarifying.

1367935166.0,1dv0sw,Supernatural explanations are not explanations at all,mikeash,89,24,230,"I've been toying with this idea and wanted to see what others think about it.

To qualify as an *explanation* of a phenomenon

Let's take a silly example. I take a piece of paper, and put the paper in a special box. Some days later, the paper appears in the mailbox of the person whose address I wrote on it. What happened?

Explanation: an organization called the Post Office employs people as mail carriers. These people routinely check the special boxes for paper labeled with an address and a stamp, and so forth in a chain until it arrives at its destination.

Not an explanation: the Post Office delivers the paper.

Why isn't this an explanation? It is, it conveys no additional information. The use of the term ""the Post Office"" here presupposes that I already know what the Post Office is, and if I knew that, I'd *already* know how the paper got from the box where I dropped it off to the mailbox of the addressee. The phrase ""delivers the paper"" is just a restatement of what happened. This explanation could be rephrased as ""Blahblah did it"" and convey the same amount of information, i.e. nothing.

I propose that supernatural explanations *always* fall into this second category. Here are some examples from what I've seen in here. Note, not some claim that every religious person thinks this way. Examples:

How did life arise?  
* Explanation: the usual stuff about evolution and abiogenesis and such.
* Example supernatural non-explanation: God created all these species. Or
* Discussion: this doesn't actually convey anything new. It just states that some entity (which we may as well call Blahblah) did what happened. It's just a longer and more convoluted way of saying ""life arose"".

What resulted in the Gospel accounts of Jesus rising from the dead?  
* Explanation: the human capacity for self-deception, just plain fictional writing, etc.
* Example supernatural non-explanation: Jesus actually rose from the dead.
* Discussion: there's a bit of new information here, so it's still extremely weak. Jesus rose from the dead, but what happened, exactly? Again it comes down to ""Blahblah did what happened"".

How does qualia, etc. happen?  
* Explanation: something about emergent behavior from the actions of individual neurons
* Example supernatural non-explanation: a separate thing called the ""mind"" is the seat of consciousness.

This is a bit unfair, atheists are asked to provide cosmology lessons and give full details on the Big Bang Theory as if we've all got PhDs. Simply because we don't fall for the claim that deities exist, we're expected to know *everything* for some reason.  The fact that nobody knows everything is often overlooked, and the intellectually honest ""I don't know"" somehow suggests to the theist that the existence of deities must be the explanation for anything we don't know (even though, historically, this has never been shown to be the case).


So if I attack something like the Kalam Cosmological argument, I am told I must read William Craig's books to get a better explanation.  The flaw, if you are wondering, is that there's been nothing in the entire course of human history that actually just begins to exist anyway -- everything is merely a reconfiguration of matter and energy from a previous arrangement.  So to say ""Everything that begins to exist..."" turns the entire argument into an ""IF"" statement, leaving the theists back at square one.


If I read Craig's books, especially among Christian apologists, with the bible.


Despite having read 3 versions of the bible from front to back, I'm beginning to go off topic here, sorry.


An atheistic argument, that's what it means.  However, when someone who *loves* to repeat himself in formal debate like Craig famously presents a reworked ancient argument as ""Everything that begins to exist has a cause..."", he's got to sell you a book to tell you what he really meant.


So now, the bible, have a Hindu friend who shares her beliefs with me, or have even once been a theist myself.

1362129857.0,19ge18,To All: Does science take faith?,samreay,86,20,265,"## **Quick answer:** 

*No.* No. No no no. No no no no no no.

## **Longer answer...**

Many theists on this forum attempt to justify faith (used in the context of holding a belief without sufficient evidence) by asserting that it takes faith to believe in science. There are two things wrong with this statement I believe; the first ignoring the magnitude of faith and the second being the assertion it is required at all.

****

**The first issue:**

Faith is not a pathway to truth, as that belief can be shown right or wrong depending on the evidence reality presents. A belief that is not reliant upon evidence is a belief does not have to reflect reality at all.

So, but it should be obvious that the infinitesimal ""leap of faith"" required to attain a belief that reality exists objectively is non comparable to the rather large leap of faith required to believe not only in the existence of an all powerful, non physical, atemporal, intelligent agency outside of time and space, but to also believe you know what this entity wants and expects you to do and think.

****

**The second

Does science take faith at all? I have never understood those that assert it does, hopefully, is an explanation as to why it does not.

The two most often misunderstood points on this topic are foundational premises and mathematical axioms. Science, declares nothing to be certain, but this is also often overlooked.

**On foundational premises**, Euclidean geometry is utilised in a theory, the theory implicitly becomes founded on the applicability and correctness of Euclidean geometry. There is no faith that Euclidean geometry is true and that it applies to the theory, that is one of the foundations, and if it is shown wrong (as it has been in many theories, such as relativity) then that theory is discarded. Having a premise to a theory is not an act of faith, it is a way to lay down the foundations for a possible explanation and build up a model which can be tested.

**On mathematical axioms**, and if they do not, and if the mathematics from axiom to model are correct, then it necessarily follows that one of the axioms is inapplicable. Then one of the axioms is removed or changed, a new model developed and then tested again.

**On the scientific method:** Another tactic often used by theists is that we have to have faith to trust in the scientific discoveries presented to us. And once again, including peer review and corroborating evidence. In order to be published (read credible) a report must undergo review. Data, experimental methodology and conclusion are checked by scientists in the field unknown to those who wrote the report. Similarly, those reviewing the report are not told the identity of the author(s). Conclusions are ensured to flow from the data, and the data itself is (except in the case of uncontentious / past data) attempted to be reproduced (note that depending on how easy it is to reproduce data it may be done independently after review). When data cannot be reproduced (such as cold fusion), the report loses all credibility. Other methods come into play, such as testing axillary hypothesis, one can use a thermometer to measure temperature, I am not placing faith in unknown individuals, but that is precisely why contentious results are not accepted as truth until extraordinary evidence is presented from credible (and multiple) sources (read up on general relativity and how long it took to be shown correct).

I must point out that all theories in science, if it cannot be vindicated or contradicted by reality then it is *not a scientific theory*. Because of this, and because of the rigorous review process, it most certainly does not take faith to accept scientific claims as our best descriptions of reality.

So named because ""Formal Fallacies"" involve logical branches : they come out of syllogistic or modal or otherwise boring arguments.

1. **Appeal to Emotion**

This is when a *pathos* appeal is made instead of (not and with) a proper argument. The key emotions to look out for are : fear, ridicule, spite and wishful thinking.

2. **Ad Hominem** 

This is when you attack the man

3. **Straw Man**

I always thought that was one word. Anyway, misrepresentation of the rival's opinion.

&gt;C: We should give children ice cream after every school day.

&gt;D: That would be rather bad for their health.

&gt;C: Do you want our children to starve?

4. **Tu Quoque**

The argument says a position is invalid because the proponent fails to act in accordance with his position. It would be like dismissing a Devil's Advocate's proof because he was DAing. 

The one I get a lot is :

1343744160.0,xg6rd,Atheism can't exist?,xLookingForAnswersx,123,57,457,"I've never used reddit before - this is my first post.  I'm going through a lot right now

My husband recently admitted to me that he has decided to become an atheist.

(When we married 8 months ago we were both ""Christian"", that is just where we were attending church at the time) 

Right now I'm not sure of much regarding Christianity/spirituality/religion, and that our souls continue somewhere (be it heaven or hell) after we die.

Last week he just refused to go to church with me - and when I pressed he blurted out that he had become atheist.  After reading some books and other information (like posts on reddit) my husband has decided that there is no God/gods/deity and has labeled himself an atheist.  He came to this conclusion on his own, and now HE has decided (after what he claims to be months of searching) that he no longer shares those values, and in fact believes the opposite.

Now to talk about the title.  With my very limited knowledge of atheism I made the claim that I feel like my husband can't really claim to be an atheist.  

He came to me and made the claim that there is no God/gods/deity.  He has absolutely zero information/proof/ANYTHING to back up his new ""beliefs"".  He kept trying to point out things he had read on reddit

I think it is unfair for him to label himself as an atheist and waltz around claiming that there is no higher power when he has zero proof to back up his claims.  I told him that I think he is agnostic

He then became angry with me and started shouting that he DOESN'T HAVE TO PROVE ANYTHING.  That he can walk around making absolute statements like ""There is NO GOD"" and does not need to have any kind of proof.  And in the same breath he told me that I CAN'T make the statement that ""There is a God/gods"" because I have no proof.  That the burden of proof lies with ME.

I don't /understand/ why I am required to prove him wrong AND myself right?  He said that this is how debate works.  I say that he isn't being fair.

Obviously a lot of people identify as atheist, ""I'm agnostic, I don't believe in a God/gods/higher power.""  Because then the individual isn't making claims incapable of being proved, just stating their own beliefs.

Many of you here are smart people. Many of you know what a fallacy is and if I told you an Argument from Majority was a bad argument

It's not as simple as that, there is a time and a place for that that makes it more appropriate than other times.

We have a system, no matter how much we disagree with them. They best serve the purpose of the thread by exposing exactly what the author has come to debate.

If we go ahead and upvote a comment made by a poster who was NOT originally addressed by the author, even if they can well represent a typical answer given, we lose the ability to debate someone real who would put forth that answer themselves and we could possibly misrepresent them. We should be doing what it is within our powers to let those being addressed by the author to express their defense. That is what we want in the limelight.

I want to propose a way to look at upvoting and downvoting. If a thread is listed:

To: Christians. You upvote Christian replies to the OP. Doesn't matter how much you disagree with them

When someone rebuts the statements given by the christian, we upvote it regardless of disagreements. This creates the best back and forth dialog we can achieve.

This creates an order in the debates:

Authors Question to X
X's reply
Best rebuttal to X
X's best rebuttal to that
And so on so forth

And this is far better than many of the current:

Author's question to X
Opposing worldviews opinion on the question
Agreement
Agreement
X's rebutal.

"" The God of the Old Testament is arguably the most unpleasant character in all fiction: jealous and proud of it; a petty, bloodthirsty ethnic cleanser; a misogynistic, homophobic, racist, infanticidal, genocidal, filicidal, megalomaniacal

Here's the problem; 

- in the atheist worldview, and moral attitudes alter throughout our history. (If any atheist would like to attempt to explain how there could be *objective* right and wrong, please do so). 

- Thus, so that what we now consider 'good' about god is then viewed as 'evil', and vice versa. God could be described in the future as being a 'monster' not because he condemns homosexuality (for example), but because he didn't condemn it strongly enough; or he offered forgiveness of sins etc. 

- as such the argument *requires* objective standards to be real

A similar process can be used against the ""we're really badly designed"" argument

**edit:** as usual

""My argument against God was that the universe seemed so cruel and unjust. But how had I got this idea of just and unjust? A man does not call a line crooked unless he has some idea of a straight line. What was I comparing this universe with when I called it unjust? If the whole show was bad and senseless from A to Z, who was supposed to be part of the show, find myself in such a violent reaction against it?... Of course I could have given up my idea of justice by saying it was nothing but a private idea of my own. But if i did that, then my argument against God collapsed too--for the argument depended on saying the world was really unjust, not simply that it did not happen to please my fancies. Thus, in the very act of trying to prove that God did not exist - in other words, that the whole of reality was senseless - I found I was forced to assume that one part of reality - namely my idea of justice - was full of sense. If the whole universe has no meaning, if there were no light in the universe and therefore no creatures with eyes

1340924735.0,vrlv0,To Jews and whoever else: A rebuttal and commentary on Namer98's list of Messianic Prophecies,EvanYork,77,11,53,"Hello /r/debatereligion.  We've probably all seen Namer98's list about Messianic prophecies and how they stack with Jesus.  But I have never seen anyone try to take it on.  So





**The whole world will worship the One God of Israel Isaiah 2:11-17**

Isaiah 2 contains no references to a person.  Isaiah 2:11-17 in particular is explicitly talking about the Day of the Lord

Isaiah 2's beginning message can be read as being fulfilled in Jesus, currently worships what they believe to be the God of Israel and almost all of these various religions (Minus the Samarithans) believe Mount Zion to be a holy place and frequently make pilgramages there.  This is largely the result of Jesus spreading the Abrahamic God throughout the nations.

**Knowledge of God will fill the world Isaiah 11:9
(This means irrefutable evidence. Knowledge

**Isaiah 11**: Namer98's belief that this means evidence over simple knowledge of scripture and the ways of God confuses me.  I accept that this could be a part of the original Hebrew

Isaiah 11:9 reads:


&gt;They will neither harm nor destroy on all my holy mountain

As discussed earlier, or is currently being fulfilled through Jesus.  It also refers to people knowing about God, which again, 53% of the world know about the God of Abraham, probably only because of Jesus.

(This one is definitely referring to a Messiah figure - earlier it references a specific person

**Jeremiah 33:31**:   My Bible doesn't have a Jeremiah 33:31.

Jeramiah 33 does contain several Messianic prophecies


**The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness Isaiah 51:11**

I see no reference in Isaiah 51 about the Messiah or any specific person.


**Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel Isaiah 52:13-53:5**

I see no reference to a person besides the Servant of God

**The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance Zechariah 8:23**

I see no Messiah in Zechariah 8.

Besides

**Weapons of war will be destroyed Ezekiel 39:9**

I do not see a Messiah in Ezekiel 39.

**All of the dead will rise again Isaiah 26:19**

I do not see any Messiah figures in Isaiah 26


Now

**The Messiah will be a warrior king.**

[This article](http://www.livius.org/men-mh/messiah/messiah_07.html) talks about it some.  All of the references are from tradition, only in the Midrash and Targum, which everyone agrees is not the height of Authority.

**He will also be preceded by Elijah.**

This comes from Malachi 4:5:

&gt;See

I do not see Messiah in Malachi 4.


**He will be a human

Jesus was human.  Jesus was born of a young woman.  This isn't an issue.  The issue is the mistranslation of the verses found in Matthew that use “virgin” instead of “Young women” and that is a different discussion entirely.
 


**Problematic verses from Namer98's list:**

**All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12**

This is definitely referring to a Messiah figure

**Also

I can't really speak on this.  I know that Ezekiel talks after these verses about a figure Ezekiel called “the Prince, so I am tentatively declaring these verses non-messianic in nature.

**Another verse I previously discussed

It's still there in the holy books: Quran 4:89, Deuteronomy 18:20, Acts 3:23.  But most people don't really *believe* that everyone not of their religion deserves severe punishment.

* Benign Neglect: Religion doesn't really help us, so we can't just ask that people *discard* it.  We can afford to simply wait for it to slowly die out, sometime in the distant future.

There is one further category, for fear of their own safety.  They suspect that not only are the religions of others false, but their own is as well; however, they dare not speak their minds, because to do so would cost them something important.  Sometimes it's family or friends, or a place in a community, or a job; sometimes, it is one's very physical safety or even one's life.

But this means that the tolerant are brought into, no one religion has a majority), but are either too tenderhearted or too devious to say so, or they believe that even their own religion is a delusion, but *fear* to say so.  There are, perhaps, a few who do not fall into these groups: those moderate, and *somebody* should stand up for it even if we don't know which religion is actually right.  But even they have reduced their religion to the equivalent of a sports team

If we care about honesty, refusal to criticize religions in which we do not believe is unjustified.

These are people who actually bothered to write into NPR and tell them how offended they were that there was a story about an atheist and how horribly this person handled their situation.

I went and dug up the original story and reread it. I am at a loss as to what she could have done differently or why it was offensive.

- Is it offensive because she should not have told anyone she was an atheist and continued her job to receive a paycheck and/or keep the peace in the community?
- Is it offensive that she didn't come clean sooner? (I don't know her situation
- Is it offensive because she was a minister and therefore supposed to be above doubts. If a minister can lose her faith

It got me thinking... does the very existence of an atheist threaten faith? Is that the heart of this issue, as her christian husband did? What does reddit think?

My conclusions from this post are that atheists overwhelmingly think atheism alone is the reason people are offended

The Kansas House on Wednesday [advanced legislation](http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2012/mar/28/house-gives-preliminary-ok-bill-supporters-say-pre/) that would allow a religious defense to discriminate against gays.

This does not support the claim that ""moderate"", that at least in Kansas, extremists are the majority.  And I'm not aware that there's anything special about Kansas.

There is no valid justification for this bill.

&gt;Matt 7:7 - *Ask, and it shall be opened unto you*

&gt;Matt 21:22 - *And all things, ye shall receive.*

&gt;John 14:13, that the Father may be glorified in the Son.  If ye shall ask any thing in my name, I will do it.*


Now, as I don't have faith, even according to the bible:


&gt;John 9:31 - *Now we know that God heareth not sinners: but if any man be a worshipper of God


However, because all you need is the amount of faith of a ""mustard seed.""


&gt;Matt 17:20 - *And Jesus said unto them, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.*


Now


So, but since we only need to perform a test, I will be satisfied with moving the mountain, say, 50 feet in any direction (except up, because I'd hate for people to be killed when it came back down).


I know that despite Jesus making very clear that prayers will be answered


&gt;Matt 28:19 - *Go ye therefore, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost:*


The reason why this should work is because you wouldn't be doing this to prove it to yourself or any selfish reason, especially those who depend on logic.  It would be considered by most to be conclusive evidence that prayer does work and God does exist, and that the one you worship is the only one and the right one.


I hope you understand that I can only consider anyone who takes this post as mockery as lacking faith.  Additionally, being that there are many Christians in the world, many of whom are exceedingly devout, I imagine that there would be many people available to pray simultaneously.  This should greatly increase the effectiveness of the prayer.


I am dead serious here, even if you assume I'm trying to be offensive.


So, or any mountain of your choice, using the power of prayer alone.  My hypothesis is still that God does not exist, so anyone with at least a mustard seed of faith, please help me carry out this test.


**Edit:**  While I do appreciate the funny, then I am thoroughly disappointed at how flippant they are about the eternal condemnation and damnation of so many people on earth.

**Update:**  So far, on the other hand, would be testing for the *existence* of God.  My search for that noble Christian who isn't here to give excuses continues.

Does free will matter when even the Demons know He exists? Why does the Bible make it seem like it’s about allegiance rather than acknowledgement?,bumwine,59,4,49,"It occurred to me from another discussion that Christian apologetics have made a sweeping re-definition of the word ""faith"" that has not been explained in light of the Bible. As of now, ""why doesn't God just show himself to everyone and let them make the choice on the matter?"" And the Christian reply pretends like God didn't do that a million times over in the Bible. 

I've read the Bible cover to cover and I have to say

From the beginning you had characters talking to God. Regardless of where you think the literal part of Biblical history began (be it Adam and Eve, or King David), they all had no doubt in his existence. Here's my key observation: it was always about allegiance, loyalty and worship of God. Again, not his existence. The whole issue with God's ever-tumultuous relationship with the Jewish nation was that while they knew he existed (I mean, cmon, you had the ENTIRE nation hear the voice of God booming through the clouds) for a fact, there were times they weren't loyal to him

In Revelation it talks of a last test involving Satan being let out and causing a final test of allegiance (whether literal or metaphorical, Abraham talking to God and even bargaining with him, you had Moses receiving visions and having powers, heck the other nations acknowledged Yahweh and even Pharoah and his army didn't deny him - they just thought their gods were better. And all through this you had people who talked to God that were still subject to failure like King David. You had Jesus performing great miracles (and the evil Pharisees denouncing Jesus even though they saw these miracles first hand, again that allegiance issue comes up again), you had his disciples resurrecting people and healing them, and even Thomas while doubting was given a demonstration. Jesus was seen ascending to the heavens. As my title mentions

Its like an eternal trip to a never ending thrills Disney World. When we loose  family members or friends that lived righteously we aren't happy for them.

**EDIT**
I think excited was a poor choice for wording...
In my question I dont mean why dont Christians kill themselves or act recklessly to bring about death more quickly. I understand the viewpoint that life is a gift. To act out recklessly or dangerously is taking that gift for granted. What  Im trying to get around to is that in the full of Life it seems the thought of going to heaven and meeting God is meet with exuberance but when the actual moment is approaching or upon us it is meet with hesitation. It just struck me as a little odd. It seems to me that people hold tight to Life no matter what their faith is. For the most part IF they didnt have to die and could change things

""Everyone"" wants to go Heaven, pain or dread. IF you believe in an afterlife then death is merely a transition. That a few years weighed against eternity is very nearly nothing. If eternal bliss and happiness awaits us then death should be meet with at the very least a smile, but Ive seen very few people accept the thought or news of death with a smile.

&gt; **Endure hardship as discipline; God is treating you as his children.** For what children are not disciplined by their father? If you are not disciplined—and everyone undergoes discipline —then you are not legitimate, in order that we may share in his holiness. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it.""

I quoted from the New Testament as much as possible to avoid the whole ""but that was the OLD testament"" circlejerk.

Yahweh overreacted in Eden by punishing Adam and Eve for slighting him by rejecting His advice. The ""sin"" of Adam and Eve cannot exactly be said to be disobedience as Adam and Eve had no concept of right and wrong. As such

It's ironic. This God who is love is the original hypocrite. The first practitioner of ""do as I say and not as I do"". He expects us to endlessly forgive those who transgress against us without placing any condition upon the transgressors. Meanwhile

I don't see how an omniscient

All we can do is anthropomorphize God. It's our only context for deciphering the motives of other beings who are said to be ""in our image"". We know that we humans do not like to get angry. But we also know that egotists like to/cannot help but to feel superior to their fellow human beings. So God does not like to get angry. But God *does* like to feel superior to his creations some of whom

I understand that the Christian response to this will be that we do not understand God's justice. Indeed. Who can understand the ""justice"" of willing that billions of people sin (Romans 5) when supposedly sin is the one thing God cannot tolerate? Who can understand the justice of a being who supposedly cannot tolerate the presence of sin

4 “Skin for skin!” Satan replied. “A man will give all he has for his own life. 5 But **now stretch out your hand and strike his flesh and bones

6 **The Lord said to Satan, he is in your hands**; but you must spare his life.”

7 So Satan went out from the presence of the Lord and afflicted Job with painful sores from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head. 8 Then Job took a piece of broken pottery and scraped himself with it as he sat among the ashes.

Even we humans can be mature enough to say, shame on me.""
But the Christian god

Did Job get even the slightest apology from the egotistical god? Hell

Job 40

40 The Lord said to Job:

2 “Will the one who contends with the Almighty correct him?
    Let him who accuses God answer him!”

Egotists cannot admit to making a mistake. All they can do is rage about how great they are. Hey. He's ""almighty"". He *must* be right. All the time.

There is no ""justice"" in this equation. Only blind

The Christian god is nothing more than the projection of an egotistical human being. Next time you overreact because you feel disrespected. Check yourself. You may want to enter into a deal with Satan and go ""the full Yahweh"".

Evolution is possible because of variation within species. Take humans, because no two organisms grow under exactly the same conditions.

Case in point: Queen bees come from the exact same larvae that worker bees originate from. They are genetically the same.

Let’s say we’re looking at a population of blue-colored

Now one day, and when given the choice between two, will always eat the palest one.

In short order, you are removed from the population by going down the predator’s gullet. But within a few generations, paler blue beetles become far rarer. Only the darker colored ones survive to breeding age, and pass on their genes (**selection**).

So more time passes

But they’re not out of the woods yet. A new predator comes along, only the biggest, fastest maturing, black beetles that spend more time crawling (**mutation**) can successfully reach mating age (**selection**).

Then the climate changes. Only big

Then a predator who attacks from above shows up. Only big, swimming beetles with wide fields of vision (**mutation**) successfully reach mating age (**selection**).

Then the climate changes again. Food becomes scarce. The predator who prefers small beetles disappears. The one that attacks from above becomes very common, becomes a drawback, and the most beneficial trait becomes eyes that are now almost completely migrated to the top of the beetle’s head. Now we have tiny, black, crawling beetles, with vestigial wings and the beginnings of eye-stalks (**mutation**) successfully reaching mating age (**selection**).

Now extrapolate that process over hundreds of millions of years.

Each change is due to minute variations in the genes of the beetle. If the original population of blue, they do. There are evolutionary dead ends, animals that couldn’t adapt to their changing environments fast enough. The population doesn’t have enough variety in their genomes to begin with. But in the case of our example population, minor variations conferred enough of an advantage over time to significantly alter the population -- probably to the point where they would not be capable of mating with the original blue beetles.

And what about those originals

So the next time you consider using a line like “if we come from monkeys

I totally agree that logical fallacies get in the way. How can you assert your point if someone points out a flaw in your logic? Logical fallacies have been used in debates throughout history. Every smart person uses logical fallacies! If they don't well then most. If not most then some. I can't think of a better way to argue than to use logical fallacies. Logical fallacies can be used for good so you can use them whenever. People that don't like logical fallacies also chew with their mouths open. If you stop using logical fallacies then maybe you'll end up stop using speech all-together! If you benefited from pointing out a logical fallacy them maybe that wasn't one of the TRUE logical fallacies.

**Kalam**:

1. Everything that begins to exist has a cause

2. The universe began to exist

3. Therefore the universe has a cause

Analysis of the cause shows it to be timeless and spaceless (since its outside time and space), eternal and personal since personal agency is the only thing we know of which can be an uncaused cause and opt to cause things at one point in eternity.

**Fine Tuning**:

1. The physical constants of the universe exist within a very narrow range that is necessary for the development of intelligent life (or any complex structures in some cases)

2. This is either due to chance

3. It is not due to chance or natural necessity

4. Therefore it's due to design

1. If God does not exist

* If you do believe it is okay for the body to abort an unfertilized egg due to genetic problems with the egg
* Do you differentiate between emergency contraceptives that work by stopping implantation vs. abortifacients that work by terminating established pregnancies?
* How important during pregnancy is it to avoid things which can lead to miscarriage and developmental problems?

**What about math

As an empiricist, and reason are still valid forms of obtaining knowledge, but that they rest totally upon empiricism. The only reason math is useful at all is because we know it corresponds with reality, and the only reason we know math corresponds with reality is through empirical evidence. One apple plus one apple equals two apples. With lots of repeated experiments and some extrapolation, we can discover how addition works in general. And from there, how operators work in general, and how functions work in general

Rationalists say that math and logic are based on apriori, therefore p"" is an incorrect argument while ""p-&gt;q, p, therefore q"" is a correct one. This is an incredibly common and intuitive mistake that people make all the time. Let us not rest our epistemology on such shaky grounds as intuition. Let's test our logic and make sure it works.

**What about a hypothetical other way of knowing

I'm not closing the door on such a methodology, and if the evidence shows us that, we can use our new methodology as if it was a starting point because it has a sound empirical basis. 

For example, because ESP has been empirically shown to be a reliable methodology.

**How do you establish that empirical evidence is a good epistemology

... I'm not sure. For now

But that does not mean that empiricism is self-defeating. Because nearly everyone agrees that empiricism is *a* good way of obtaining knowledge - if not the only one - my assumption is not really under fire. Once I have agreement that empiricism is one of the possibly many good ways of obtaining knowledge

The moderation team has changed their mind and is now implementing the following, either.

As a result

DEMI-MODS - a corp of r/DR users who will be given post level moderation rights.  This means they will be able to approve, and ANYONE who is interested can ask to be a demi-mod.  The new demi-mod will be probationary, until they have demonstrated that they will use their new power in a responsible manner.  (Never forget the gospel of Uncle Benjamin.)  Demi-mods will get a silver star.

WATCHMODS - obviously, the second new corp will be WatchMods.  They have no actual moderator permissions, but they are able to see and read the mod mail, the mod queue, and the mod log. Anyone can be a watchmod, just ask.  WatchMods will get a green star.  Who watches the mods and demi-mods?  The WATCHMODS!

Also

This is experimental!  If this whole idea goes totally sideways and breaks the community, productive, and to raise the level of discourse even higher.

The mods will create two posts for applying to be a demi-mod and watchmods.  Once those posts have fallen off the front page

Along with the demi-mods and the watchmods

New post and comment content rules!

Since the moderation is going to be heavier

This thread is for taking suggestions and comments from the community about the proposed new rules.

With no further ado:  the proposed new rules

- Posts and comments insulting or attacking a particular person or group of people may be moderated.

- Posts which criticize an idea or belief using derogatory or profane language with no redeeming thematic purpose may be moderated.

- Posts which contain gratuitous profane language may be moderated.

- Only the Mods can ban users.  Demi-mods do not have any power to ban users.  Users will be banned based solely on the opinion of the mods.

Basically, and you should expect it to be moderated.

(Please note the use of the word *may* in the above rules.)

The Messiah is a person who will live up to a series of prophetic expectations and partake of an era marked by particular characteristics. In absence of such being the case

&gt;The whole world will worship the One God of Israel. Isaiah 2:11-17

Currently large swaths humanity do not worship the One God of Israel. 

&gt;Knowledge of God will fill the world. Isaiah 11:9, Jeremiah 31:33, Zechariah 3:9, 8:23, 14:9,16, Ezekiel 38:23

Note that this is *knowledge* of God - not simply unsubstantiated faith in God. Even amongst the faithful

&gt;All Israelites will be returned to their homeland Isaiah 11:12, 36:24, Deuteronomy 30:3

Though there are more Jews today living in the Land of Israel than there have been since the exile began nearly 2

&gt;The Jewish people will experience eternal joy and gladness. Isaiah 51:11

The Jewish people have been historically subject to a great degree of persecution (the Holocaust, etc.) and while generally our condition has improved, we are still a perpetual target. 

&gt;Nations will recognize the wrongs they did to Israel. Isaiah 52:13-53:5

While modern Germany as a nation-state does much to repent of its history (i.e. the Holocaust), white-wash/cover up history, or in some perverse instances even exult in it. 

&gt;The peoples of the world will turn to the Jews for spiritual guidance. Zechariah 8:23

While there is today an emerging interest in observance of the Noahide laws (the Torah's universal laws of man)

&gt;Weapons of war will be destroyed. Ezekiel 39:9

One need only momentarily consider the trillions spent on arms by nations such as the U.S.

&gt;A person’s genealogical/tribal membership are transmitted exclusively through one’s physical father. Numbers 1:18

Jesus whose alleged sketchy genealogy is maternal cannot possibly be a verifiable descendent of the tribe of Judah. 

&gt;The Temple will be rebuilt. Micah 4:1, Malachi 3:4, Zechariah 14:20-21,

The Third Temple is not a metaphor

&gt;World Peace: Isaiah 2:4, Hosea 2:20

The list of ongoing military conflicts is too long to list here. One can hardly pick up a newspaper or hear a news report without being informed of the latest battle, etc. 

&gt;Christianity claims that Jesus ""Fulfilled the law

Deut. 13:2-7 concerns the ""false prophet"" - if one arises who attempts to draw the Jewish people away from Torah observance then he is to be identified as such. The Torah's commandments are an eternally binding covenant with the Jews, that He should repent"" (Num. 23:19)

&gt;All Jews will embrace Torah observance. Ezekiel 37:24, Ezekiel 11:19-20, 36:26-27.

It is fairly obvious that as the situation stands today

&gt; Jesus cannot be a part of God

The idea of the Messiah actually partaking of divinity is anathema to Torah Judaism. God is ONE. His oneness is inviolable and is not that of a compound unity (like twelve eggs make one dozen

&gt;The law is eternal.

Exodus 12:14, 27:21, 28:43, Leviticus 3:17, 7:36, 10:9, 16:29, 16:34, 23:31, 15:15

To summarize ([H. Melakhim Ch. 11](http://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/1188356/jewish/Chapter-11.htm)): 

*In the future, in his days, the observance of all the statutes will return to their previous state. We will offer sacrifices, observe the Sabbatical and Jubilee years according to all their particulars as described by the Torah...*

*If a king will arise from the House of David who diligently contemplates the Torah and observes its mitzvot as prescribed by the Written Law and the Oral Law as David, and fight the wars of God, we may, with assurance, consider him Moshiah. If he succeeds in the above, builds the Temple in its place, and gathers the dispersed of Israel, motivating all the nations to serve God together

The Messiah will basically be a human religious leader and a warrior king born of a *young woman.* He will **not die and come back, [once he died](http://imgur.com/a/N1kbb) and thus failed to live up to the aforementioned expectations, the Sages effectively shrugged and said ""oh well... he wasn't it."" To borrow a phrase ""The God of the Hebrew Bible sends the messianic king to accomplish his end, not to follow a two-part script in which the hero tragically dies and the words 'to be continued' suddenly appear on the screen.""

1360264763.0,182x2s,To all: A quick primer on evolution for creationists,GoodDamon,55,7,153,"&gt; **Kingdom**: *Animalia*

&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: The first of what we call ""animals"" appear in the fossil record about 542 million years ago, with only minor differences in detail.
&gt;&gt; **Phylum**: *Chordata*

&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: One group of those simple early creatures adapted to its environments by elongating and thinning. Not terribly different from its cousin animals, thin, flexible body definitely gave it some advantages that it passed on, in some circumstances. No new structures, of course. Just the adaptation of some of the body's cells into a sort of primitive backbone. Other early animals adapted to different environments in different ways, but you can't really say we've moved outside of kind just because one group has thinned and lengthened and another group -- say, echinoderms -- has not. Those early echinoderms stayed shorter and a little thicker, but the ones that survived to breed eventually emphasized other traits I won't go into.
&gt;&gt;&gt; **Class**: *Synapsida*

&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Those chordatas really had some success with that whole ""backbone"" cluster of cells thing they had going on, it would be pretty hard to say they were no longer of a kind with other chordatas just because they happened to have a particular gap in what we'd call the ""skull"" part of that bony structure. And really, it could be argued that this wasn't the best adaptation that could have happened for them, because only one small group of them survived.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Class**: *Mammalia*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Really, they all had backbones, bilateral symmetry, they were all tetrapods, and so forth. Differences were fairly minor, detail stuff. I mean, what's the difference if your fur is thicker or thinner, on the one hand we have gigantic dogs like Great Danes, given their environment
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Order**: *Primates*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: And sure, flexible body useful for survival!), but primates share a lot more similarities than differences with the other mammals. I mean, all you have to do is look at how similarly that collection of hard cells we call ""bones"" is laid out when you compare primates to other mammals, and you can see it's quite obvious we're still within kind, here.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Family**: *Hominidae*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: The differences at this level of granularity are even harder to see. The ""great apes"" are so similar to one another and the ""lesser apes, other than size?
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Tribe**: *Hominini*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Some members of the hominidae family adapted separately. The ""panini"" tribe got a little hairier, we call this group of great apes bonobos and chimpanzees. There's another tribe of great apes called gorillini that's so similar it's hardly worth mentioning at all. Contrast the panini with the hominini, and there's hardly any difference. Homininis stood a little taller, had slightly larger craniums for their body mass, and weren't as hairy. All really minor variations. In fact, it's kind of hard to de-tangle exactly where paninis, gorillinis, since they're so darn similar and have such overlapping periods of time in which they lived.
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Genus**: *Homo*

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; **Adaptation within kind**: Talk about splitting hairs. So many of the differences between these particular groups of great apes almost seem arbitrary. One group has nominally bigger chests. One group has nominally bigger heads. They are all only slightly less hairy than other hominini, they all spend most of their time upright, they eat the same kinds of things, and so on. An early member of this genus, *homo heidelbergensis*, seems to have adapted in two nominally different ways (one of which was called *homo neanderthalensis*) but it's readily apparent from DNA tests that they were so similar, those two supposed ""branches"" of adaptation within kind interbred. And their kids? The *eukaryotes* with well developed *chordata* backbones, *mammalia* body features, called modern *homo sapiens* are hardly different at all

Obviously I've simplified this a great deal. I've left out subfamilies and superfamilies, feathers, and scales, and a great many other details. I focused on the backbone because it's a component of animal development that is visually, obviously similar across a wide range of species. But rest assured, all of it is similarly incremental and obvious in nature.

The point of all this is to explain to creationists that when they say they accept ""adaptation within kind, you accept evolution.

There are veritable mountains of evidence for evolution available at your nearest library or bookstore

There's really only one way to attack evolution once you actually understand that, unless you understand the science that indicates an old Earth. And I contend that any of you who permit yourselves to understand what evolution and the geological sciences actually indicate about the age of the Earth will either need to reject science itself rather than continue to claim it supports your beliefs, or reject creationism.

2. Abortion takes the life of an innocent human being without proper justification.
3. Abortion is wrong.

To believe that abortion is not wrong

Starting with premise 2

* Abortion kills *something*.

This seems obvious to me. If the thing inside of mom isn't alive, taking resources, etc, then there would be no reason to try to get rid of it. It is exactly the entity's ""aliveness"" that is causing the mother distress in the first place.

Not to mention any medical doctor you ask is going to refer to fertilized egg, infant, etc as a living thing. No one with any medical training what-so-ever thinks that these things aren't alive in a biological sense.

* That *something* is not a part of the mother.

Medically

* That *something* is another human being.

Again, you get the same species. Presumably, then we have no reason to doubt that the product of human reproduction is another human. Biologically, an embryo is a human being in the earliest stage of development.

* That human being is innocent.

A child inside the mother's womb is about as innocent as you can get. The child has no understanding of right and wrong

Many people may try to claim that the baby is not innocent because he is an invader, it was the mothers own body that caused his or her formation, so the child is innocent of any invasion.

* The justification usually offered for abortion is insufficient. 

""Proper justification"" would be justification that we would usually accept for taking innocent human life. Here is a test to see if someone's justification for abortion is sufficient or not. Apply the same justification they give for killing an unborn human being to a two year old. Does it still seem justified? If not

For example: She had an abortion because the pregnancy was a product of a rape. She killed her two year old because he was a product of a rape.

She had an abortion because she wanted to focus on her career. She killed her two year old because she wanted to focus on her career.

She had an abortion because she didn't want to be a single mother. She killed her two year old because she didn't want to be a single mother.

You get the idea.

Once the second premise is shown to be sound

* What is the difference between a human being and a person?

The argument usually goes something like this. Not all human beings are persons, mental disorders, and people of races that the Nazi's deemed inferior.

Most people who argue for the personhood argument abhor this kind of thing. But still the question is

* Size and appearance

Does the way someone look or the amount of space they take up increase or decrease personhood? Do short people have less value than tall? Ugly people less than beautiful people?

* Level of development

Do children have less value than adults? Should we be ageists? What about people with developmental issues? If level of development decreases a human being's personhood

* Environment and location

How much moral significance is there to a 7 inch journey down the birth canal? When I cross the street do I lose my personhood?

* Degree of dependency

If this is the key difference then infants still are not persons. They depend fully on their parents and will not last long at all without their care. Shoot

All of these things seem to be completely insignificant when determining a human being's value. So again

It is my view that there is no difference. That nothing makes these little human beings unworthy of life. The value of personhood is found in each and every human being, their dependency, or location. Human beings are inherently valuable. Their value comes from what they are, not from any outside requirement.",,False,,False,t3_12c59a
1351455607.0,128g2l,Why I care about religion,mikeash,62,17,187,"People in here often ask why atheists bother to debate religion. If there are no consequences to one's beliefs

I had a realization the other day that really clarified my own thinking about it

I was at a party the other day, etc. Fairly mundane stuff.

At one point

And I got to thinking, such a concept is not supported by any actual evidence. But it's a pretty common idea even though it has no legitimate support. How does such an idea survive and thrive when it's just not true?

It occurred to me that confirmation bias gets passed down through generations. An individual could come up with the idea that they can guess the sex of their baby through confirmation bias. I don't know how often this would happen on its own

But then once one person has this idea, the whole idea can become embedded in the culture.

This is one example of what I'll term ""magical thinking"". I would define ""magical thinking"" as anything where A is believed to cause B without any solid evidence or plausible mechanism of action

* Common superstitions of all kinds, fear of black cats, etc.
* The idea that the results of die rolls are inter-dependent
* Gamblers' ""systems"" of all sorts.
* Homeopathy.
* Political beliefs of all kinds.

And of course the great granddaddy of them all

If one's religious beliefs are harmless, at least.) Religion is exceptional in this regard because it's perhaps the only form of organized magical thinking which it is not only widely accepted but also widely considered to be above criticism. If somebody uses a homeopathic remedy for an illness, it's generally acceptable (if quite possibly rude) to point out that such remedies are indistinguishable from water and work no better than a placebo. But if somebody prays for an illness, it's usually completely unacceptable to point out that such actions are indistinguishable from talking to one's self and work no better than a placebo.

In short, it leads to other, more harmful kinds. In a society where certain kinds of magical thinking are beyond criticism, it becomes harder to point out why *any* kind of magical thinking is wrong.

And so we get alternative pharmacies selling water to cure diseases, and on and on. And why wouldn't people fall for this stuff? They have respected community leaders preaching the same *kind* of thinking, even if not exactly the same thinking, as part of their supposed ultimate truth.

I don't bother to argue with people who believe in homeopathy or other junk science, etc. Debating religion is, for me, just another branch of this general theme of combating magical thinking.

1341981811.0,wdbk0,To Christians and Jews: The Exodus myth. There is no archaeological evidence for the Exodus but in fact mounds of evidence to reject it.,daybreakin,72,27,252,"About 15 years ago


I offered to lend the tape to a Christian friend who I thought naturally would like to view a video on this topic. I was wrong. This person had no interest in viewing a video on Bible archeology. Religious people often refuse to learn about their religion. Learning new facts complicates faith.



I grew up hearing much of the religious misinformation claiming that archeology "" proved"" the bible. The religious claims of early archeologists saying that the city of Jericho was conquered by Joshua was frequently announced along with other isolated examples. It was as if the existence of a particular spring, the stories about Hercules and Zeus must have been true. With regard to Jericho, I read other articles from later studies that used better dating methods that clearly showed that Jericho had been destroyed long before the mythological Joshua would have come along and tried to take the city.



The controversy surrounding the alleged enslavement and exodus is not new. Sources dating back to 400 BCE already contained conflicting accounts of the Israelites' origins and supposed expulsion from Egypt because they were diseased (1). As early as 1100 CE, in the fine tradition of Christianity, threatened to kill this man if he did not retract this finding.



Recently, Belgium) summarized the archeological findings and latest corrections regarding the historical origins of the Jewish nation. In their words, ""The process that we describe here is, in fact, the opposite of what we have in the Bible: the emergence of early Israel was an outcome of the collapse of the Canaanite culture, not its cause. And most of the Israelites did not come from outside Canaan - they emerged from within it. There was no mass exodus from Egypt. There was no violent conquest of Canaan"" (3).



Finkelstein and Silberman point out that there is still no evidence for the existence of Abraham, Lot, Moses, and Joshua. There is no evidence that Jewish people existed as an identified people that were enslaved in Egypt. There is no evidence that over 600,000 men (plus women and children - the number could have been over a million) had an exodus from Egypt and wandered in the desert for 40 years. According to the Bible, 38 of these 40 years were actually spent encamped at Kadesh-barnea. This area has been turned upside down for decades, looking for even a tiny piece of pottery from this supposed time. It is not likely that this many people would have lived here this long and not left archeological evidence.



The archeological evidence contradicts the Biblical theme of Joshua taking control of the Israelites from Moses and conquering Canaan. For example, conquering three cities is refuted by the archaeological evidence that these cities were destroyed over a 1000 year period and that Jericho was destroyed even before Joshua could have conquered it.  The Biblical themes of the origins of Israel are myths. Like the gospel accounts of the New Testament, they were fabricated in later times and inserted into earlier times as a tool of religious and political propagandists (2, 4, 5).



One thing is certain. If a god existed



You may also want to review the [NOVA 2-hour program](http://video.pbs.org/video/1051895565/) aired on 11/18/2008 on the lack of evidence for the Exodus and the origins of the Hebrew Bible on the pbs.org site. It caused quite a stir. Someone recently informed me that Gerald Aardsma is still attempting to revise Biblical chronology. Scholars have not taken his work seriously. The scientific community has yet to find support for his beliefs in Noah’s Ark/the Flood, etc. The study of genetics has clearly disproven the Adam and Eve myth.

Ideally, reads from a contrasting point of view (if we have a book that argues that there is historical evidence for a divine Jesus, we would also have a book by someone like Ehrman that argues there is not enough evidence to claim Jesus was divine, for example). 

I can probably pick a decent selection of books that argue against a theist view, to relate to the topics we find in here. They do not have to be books or even all that long. I'd personally prefer the reading list to be representative of expert opinions, but I'm sure we can decide what should and shouldn't go on the list as we go. I'm leaning away from including blog links or links to youtube vids for the sake of brevity, but maybe a selection of some very excellent ones would be good.

My goal is to help everyone be more well read on the subjects we're debating. I know there are a ton of things I need to read up on and understand better and I assume many people in here feel the same. I think the quality of our debates in here would go up if people were well read on their own points of view as well as the points of view of others. Also, will you read Dennett with an open mind?

So I'm hoping there are more Christians here who do believe in demonic possession...

I was reading the bible and it seems like one of the symptoms of being possessed by a demon or Satan is turning away from God. For example, he started to plot against Jesus. Also in 1 Timothy 4:1–5, Paul states that people who were Christians then turned away are now devoting themselves to demons. 

Does this mean that atheists might be actually be possessed by demons? If that person is possessed

I think about religion all the time, a need for meaning, and a craving for power. Even if you yourself don't individually subscribe to one of these points, these themes are evident through history and contemporary society. I believe that religion was the initial form of 'science', to explain the unexplainable and the original code of laws to create order in an orderless society. Archaic, yes, crude, but evil? I would say no.

Religion has been used as a tool for power where, to kill others in order to reclaim the Holy Land , to oppress a class of society. It is easy to look at these and say, ""Religion is bad"". But what religion has also done is provide hope to those who have no alternative form of hope, to give people a reason to act benevolent to others, to create a commonality between classes that may have never been united otherwise. You can look at this and say ""Religion is good"". Religion has both positive and negative aspects to it but ultimately what it comes down to is that religion is a **tool**. And like any tool, it can be used for good and it can be used for evil depending on the **people** who use the tool. 

I think the people who say that violence is caused or influenced by video games are silly. Yes

What bothers me is that the topic of religion has become similar to sports where people choose one side over the other and bond over that side without thinking of the opposition. It's nice to have emotional support on an issue you feel strongly about but at the same time

My plea is for people to look at both religion and atheism as a product of humanity and not something that is good or bad but something that just ***is***. They are each things that affect humanity because of how humanity uses it. I'll debate this if you'd like,,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,True

1. Simplicity - I'm less likely to consider that I'm too dumb to find the error if the argument is simple

2. Grounding in the physical world - The most persuasive of the arguments I've heard is the fine tuning argument (not that its conclusion is true) because it starts with a very real set of data rather than metaphysical novel concepts.

That being said, why is it any worse than any other sin? Why do we have discussion and religious groups backing legislation against the ""sin"" of having a gay lifestyle and not other sins like, say, divorce or adultery (which is just as bad, according to the Bible).

Why do we beat this topic to death in the Christianity sub-reddit? There isn't thread upon thread about divorce, kissing your wife when she's on her period, or in general, what your neighbors are doing in their bedrooms (heterosexual anal sex, BDSM, etc...)

Really, the same questions about homosexuality are brought up again and again and discussed to death. Why are we SO into judging our neighbor for homosexuality, but nothing else? Should we be judging others at all for what they do in their private lives? Sin or not, why is it OUR business and wouldn't it be between them and God? Somebody else's homosexuality does not harm you in any way, so why does it constantly have to be discussed?

I realize by just asking this question, but why can't Christians just butt out when it comes to the sexual orientation of their brothers and sisters?

1338865823.0,ulg82,Premise and Context.,,54,13,27,"I just want to address a few debating faux pas I've been seeing a lot lately.

**Established Premise:**

Often an argument begins with an established premise

    Is time travel ethical?

Would be a debate based on the premise that time travel is possible

**Established Context**

    If time lines are immutable and no matter your actions in the past you can't change the present
    your actions while time travelling through the past ethical?

This debate not only has the established premise that time travel is possible

**Applying this to religious debate**

    Why would God damn people to hell?

The premise is God exists. This debate can not be won by refuting his existence. Although without context

    Why does the Christian God damn people to Hell?

The premise is the Christian God exists as he is described in the Christian bible

[Edited: Corrected - thanks LiptonCB] Expect mostly answers quoting religious text

**Wording your argument**

If you want to have a debate about a particular aspect of God then word your argument accordingly.

    If the Christian God damns good people to Hell

The premise is God's justice is debatable and the part of the bible that says he is just may be incorrect. This opens the floor to different views of what constitutes justice that are not restricted to the Christian belief system. 

[EDIT]: If you wish your argument to be the basis for debate on the topic of God's existence

    The bible says God is just and loving
    neither just nor loving. These indiscrepancies prove at the very least the Christian God doesn't exist as he 
    does in the bible and cast doubt on him existing at all.

There is no established premise on the existence of God. Therefore

**TL;DR**

Debate based on premise. If you disagree with the premise then view the debate as hypothetical or start a new debate about said premise rather than arguing outside the scope of the debate.

* They are capable of their own creation and caused the Big Bang

* They have always existed and caused the Big Bang.

* Something existed before the subatomic particle

If not, by definition of a God, he would be capable of existing eternally unlike a natural feature of our universe.

1316960583.0,kqume,Thoughts from the mods,pstryder,59,15,440,"TL;DR - are you kidding?  If you don't want to read anything longer than a sentence or two

So

Before I discuss my personal opinion on some of the things brought up

Reported posts and comments:  Every report has been a comment made by (someone who appears to be) an atheist criticizing religious belief.  And yes

Calls for a theist moderator:  No one has complained to the mods at all about the moderation.  No one has articulated a decent reason for a theist mod.  The only thing that keeps being said is something along the lines of it 'providing a sense of balance.'  When pressed

Now

The issues that HAVE been raised:  I'll start with the claim that a theist mod will make theists feel more welcome and increase the amount of activity theists contribute:  the only way they could so is to take a very active role by removing posts that in their opinion are unfairly critical to theist ideas.  There's an obvious problem here:  how can you enforce this nebulous idea of 'respect' for theistic thought without practicing censorship against atheistic thought?

Why don't theists post more?  Well, logic, or even consistency.  Theists cannot stomach dissenting thought.  They simply have no answers that don't sound stupid with more than 30 seconds of intelligent thought.

Now, I will not delete the comment.  If you want to call theists lame-brained morons with no capacity for freedom of thought, I will not delete the comment.  As long as the comment is on topic and is not spam, I'm going to allow it.  My position as moderator does not give me the right to silence any side of the debate.  I am not the 'tone police'.  I am not here to enforce any kind of 'rules of polite conversation.'  I find the very idea revolting and antithetical to open debate and discussion.

The idea was that not having downvotes in this sub would encourage more theists to participate in the discussion.  However, I think the fact that the objective (encouraging theists to participate) is not being met (even though we have capitulated with their demand that theists not have to face any consequence for making bad arguments) demonstrates that disabling the best tool for the community to police itself is a mistake.

And now that they have that, they are demanding that someone who agrees with them be given power to use force (censorship) to ensure they get the respect they feel (wrongly, in my opinion) their opinion deserves.

Now

Ideas DO NOT **deserve** respect.  PERIOD.  Ideas are given the respect that is earned by their character.  If *you* feel an idea warrants respect

Now, (because that is the respect due a person) you do not owe **the idea** any respect.  You do not have to listen, you do not have to read it, you do not have to do anything but allow them the same right you have to present it.

If you have wrapped your ego so tightly into an idea that any criticism of that idea (no matter what the tone) feels like an attack on you personally that is **your** problem.  Offense cannot be *given*

Now

For the most part, and I almost ALWAYS approve posts that have been reported or have been caught in the spam filter.

My guideline is pretty simple:  always error on the side of freedom of expression.  I would rather be wrong by letting someone speak

1341505374.0,w2yr3,To All: The uselessness of faith,MJtheProphet,62,21,123,"I anticipate, but because I have faith.""  It's nuanced

The problem is, at least in my experience, who appeal to faith as a justification for their beliefs, and yet there are constant betrayals of this declaration.  What are supposedly fulfilled prophecies if not *evidence* that one's belief is justified?  Why make *new* prophecies if it is not a key component of the belief system that evidence for its truth will be provided in the future?  And what of miracles?  If belief were truly based in faith, then the apostles would not have had to *prove* their veracity by appealing to the miracles they could perform, and Jesus would not have had to *do* anything amazing to be accepted as the son of god.  And for that matter, go back to the Hebrew Bible, to prove with clear evidence that Yahweh's commands should be followed, and even (incorrect

At every turn, had *actually* been reliably dated to around 29 or 30 CE, and shown to be consistent with the cloth workings of the region, and so on, what Christian would have simply turned away in disinterest, knowing that their beliefs were not based on crude evidence that the stories were true, but rather on faith?  What Jew would not feel justified in the truth of their beliefs if *Raiders of the Lost Ark* were a documentary?  Without question, as do all the other people who promote ideas of intelligent design.  And the tradition goes back as far as we might care to look.  When accusing women of witchcraft, the old woman you accused had to be one with a similar injury.

It is an incredibly rare person who denies the utility of evidence for supporting belief.  We all seem to not only know that evidence is powerful, and even then the slightest intimation that there *is* evidence will be grasped at hungrily; observe Jesus' image on toast or water stains or snack food.  Observe [Sanal Edamaruku](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/friendlyatheist/2012/07/05/indian-rationalist-still-in-hiding-after-debunking-miracle/), who showed that a ""miracle"" of a statue of the crucifixion dripping water from its feet was the result of a leaky sewage drainage system, and is now in hiding because the Catholic church wants him *arrested* for breaking the spell of their delusions.  There is no ""leap of faith"", because the faithful admit almost constantly that evidence-based justification is not across some chasm, but kept quite comfortably within reach.  There are no ""separate magisteria"", for no believer would ignore the situation if empirical science showed support for their religion.  Faith has no utility to justify belief

TL;DR - Not even those who try to use faith to justify their beliefs think that faith actually *works* as a belief justification.  They appeal to evidence constantly, terrible evidence if they think it supports their beliefs, because even that provides (or seems to) a stronger justification than faith.

1331400031.0,qqffg,The Problem With 'Moderate' Christians,Ericgzg,59,16,326,"Saw this in the comments of r/atheism

So a Moderate Christian (username is coolcrate) says:
I'm an episcopalian and I really get annoyed when I see post after post about how bad, and shouldn't be discriminated against for what they believe. I'm not saying that people who are christians are innocent in this case, I'm just saying not all of us are bad. I just think it's very annoying how much anti-christian posts are on r/atheism. I know you don't believe in any god, but what is so wrong about believing? I understand that some things in the Bible are radical and unnecessary in todays world. I personally believe members of the homosexual community should have as much rights as anyone else in America. I may not agree with the whole bible, but I do believe in Jesus Christ. While I would never try to force you to join my religion, I might have a friendly debate on beliefs, which the posts from r/atheism never have. I just want the hate posts about Christianity to stop. 

Atheist response: You've just demonstrated why I can't respect your belief system and what is wrong with this belief. And let me be clear, how to live, etc. When you say, ""I understand some things in the Bible are radical and unnecessary,"" you admit to rejecting areas of the bible based on some other, contradictory source of values/morals, e.g. accepting gays. And I assume you wear mixed-fabric clothing, support women's rights, you know that too. But this also applies to Jesus. It's actually not easy to find support for Jesus' existence, and accept other parts

UPDATE: From the comments author (Mexihanz6):

A lot of you missed my point entirely (here’s looking at you, and I'd rather have them running around than Jesus Campers, evangelicals and Westboro.  But my response doesn’t even address problems with fundamentalism, because that wasn’t the issue.  Now, to explain my response... I think it's a pretty fair statement to say the source for the Christian religion is the bible.  The bible contains passages in both the old and new testament that reasonable people, including moderate Christians like coolcrate, wholly reject.

*Atheists make baseless assumptions

If I see that argument again

The problem with it is two-fold. First, and that applies equally to theists and atheists.

But that's not even the worst part. Consider the following questions:

* How do you know you've ever read your holy book?
* How do you know you've ever listened to a religious instructor?
* How do you know you've ever talked to anyone about your religion?
* How do you know you've ever received any valid information about your religion through your senses in any way

Belief, that sacred faculty which prompts the decisions of our will, and knits into harmonious working all the compacted energies of our being, is ours not for ourselves but for humanity. It is rightly used on truths which have been established by long experience and waiting toil, and which have stood in the fierce light of free and fearless questioning.

&gt;If a man, purposely avoids the reading of books and the company of men that call into question or discuss it, and regards as impious those questions which cannot easily be asked without disturbing it -- the life of that man is one long sin against mankind....

1364225443.0,1az6uw,To theists: Argument against both versions of omnipotence,GoodDamon,51,12,156,"One of the things that keeps coming up is the 3-O god's attributes

So I would like to propose here that both versions of it entail problems for theism.

---
Version 1: True omnipotence 
---
---

**Definition**: Princeton's WordNet search gives a simple

I don't think many theists disagree that this version of omnipotence is problematically self-refuting. When atheists ask questions like ""can God create a rock so heavy even he can't lift it, because they show that this definition of omnipotence is both simplistic and logically flawed. A ""yes"" answer yields a god who can do logically impossible things, refuting logic itself, and a ""no"" answer yields a god who is limited after all.

So it is perfectly sensible for theists to use a different definition of omnipotence. However

We will call this version ""omnipotence(a).""

---
Version 2: Logically possible omnipotence
---
---

**Definition**: Roughly, married bachelors, or rocks so heavy that God can't lift them.

We will call this version ""omnipotence(b).""

This is the version of omnipotence I would like to focus on for the purpose of this argument

So walk through this with me.

---
The argument
---
---

**Argument definitions**:

* (Definition) ""Everything"" is defined as all matter, all natural laws described by physics, all logic, all reason, and any other philosophically recognizable real or abstract object.
* (Definition) An ""omnipotent(a) being"" is one that is capable of logically impossible acts.
* (Definition) An ""omnipotent(b) being"" is one that is capable of any logically possible act. Conversely

**Argument**:

* (Premise 1) God is an omnipotent(b) being.
* (Premise 2) God created everything.
* (Premise 3) God is not subservient to anything.
* (Conclusion 1) Per P2
* (Conclusion 2) Per P3
* (Conclusion 3) Therefore

---
Predicted criticism
---
---

I doubt most theists will contest *P1*, then something -- namely, logic -- precedes him. And *P3* is even more difficult to attack, because if God is subservient to anything, then there is something greater than God.

*C1* is entailed by *P2* and is unavoidable unless you exclude logic from the definition of ""everything, again, you exclude logic from the definition of ""everything.""

Furthermore, and end up with a regressive loop wherein God cannot change his own nature, but must somewhere be restricted from doing so from outside himself. It looks something like this:

1. **Q**: Can God change his nature?
2. **A**: No
3. **Q**: Can God change the rule that his nature prevents it?
4. **A**: No
5. **Q**: Can God change *that* rule?
6. *Etc., ad infinitum*.

It's a vicious logical regress solvable only by excluding God from logic... which brings us back to omnipotence(a).

---
Conclusion
---
---

I propose that what we've seen here is a problem entailed by omnipotence(b) applied to the creator of everything. God can either create everything **including** logic, or he can create everything **excluding** logic, possess omnipotence(b), and be susceptible to ""who created God/who created restrictions on God"" style questions.

What seems to be the inescapable conclusion from all this is that both concepts of God's omnipotence are incoherent or at least incompatible with other properties attributed to God.",,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1az6uw/to_theists_argument_against_both_versions_of/

You often hear religious people say that belief in God is just a choice that is left up to us. This argument is commonly used when they are asked to provide evidence of their God. If God just reveals himself to us, one cannot ""choose,"" to have knowledge of something (ie: Jesus is God.) Theists often confuse rejection of God with rejection in the *belief* in God, until humans have true knowledge of God and objective morality,  then they can be judged justly.  If that does not convince you, then I will show you the consequences of leaving belief in God up to choice.


There are many religions and supernatural versions of reality a human is disposed to. This human does not know the objective way to choose the right religion,, [martyrdom for God](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/September_11_attacks), the Indian caste system, human sacrifice to God, [conflict in ideologies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crusades) etc, and all of these evil acts are justified because of ""free will."" Similarly, then I am not accountable to God because he is giving me the freewill to believe whatever I want to. Also because I *believe* that the aliens are omniscient and therefore moral in whatever they command. On the surface


God not revealing himself to us is actually proof of his non-existence. If he is benevolent and cared about the human race, see above.)  He is a source of evil and suffering and therefore not benevolent. ",,False,,t5_2snuc,1346216715.0,userflair,

Thus proving that the early Christians tried to 'fulfill' OT prophecies in order convince Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.",plissken627,21, which undisputedly means 'young woman', the Apostle and contemporary of Jesus


ISAIAH' S REFERENCE: (Septuagint Version)


Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son


The facts are that, king of Judah. He and his people became alarmed.


Isaiah assures him in the 'name of the Lord' (the cant phrase of prophets) that the two kings will not succeed against him and delivers the words quoted above. In verse 16 he specifies the timing before this child shall know to refuse evil and choose the good


Perhaps Isaiah had someone already in mind for in the next chapter verse 2 he says I took unto me faithful witnesses to record


Isaiah was proved false and Ahaz was defeated as related in the 28th chapter of Chronicles II.


If this is not enough evidence that early Christians tried to forge OT prophecy 'fulfillments'  in order convince Jews that Jesus was the Messiah; then what evidence would convince you? What evidence would convince you that Jesus of Nazareth was just a normal man and that his divinity was just added on by the early Christians? The virgin birth prophecy is one of the most important in the gospels, why would Jesus *expect* his logical and rational humans to still believe in him/not leave the belief when they gain access to this information?

1343651436.0,xdzcc,Here's the thing I don't get about Christianity and other religions.  Help me out here.,EightySixxed,49,6,171,"There are so many views on the story of Christ; from Catholicism to the various forms of Christianity; Evangelical, etc...  Not only that

My point being is that I find it incredibly odd that the story and message of one man changes so much; it's pretty much interpretive.  What I don't get is how someone can notice this and not think it's strange.  Let's compare this to science.  You have a textbook that different classes use (like the bible), projects, and homework assignments (pastors with different sermons, songs, and worship).  Here's where it gets different, no matter how you teach it, science doesn't change.  It is always out there, even if your teacher makes a mistake.  In religion

What is the one truth, but that should have no effect on the actual outcome.

Personally, including science books, and everyone forgot everything and we had to start over, would religion come back the same way?  Would we even know who Christ was?  I can assert that we would not, and I'm sure something else would come about instead.  You can't say the same for science.  We wouldn't get it right the first time around probably, like last time, but in the end

So, mashing them like playdough to make it fit their own reality so they can continue accepting the religion in strong opposition to what the rest of world says is true (oh, suddenly this or that passage is a metaphor, or a parable, or not meant to be taken literally, or a miss-translation, or ""here's my interpretation that makes it kind of make sense"").  Think about how much the rules have changed over the years, with theists having to sink further and further into a delusional world of their own making so they can continue to be comforted by the security blanket that is God.

1328126524.0,p6k5l,The case that the exodus never happened ,dhooke,46,9,175,"**Indigenous origins of the Israelites**

The culture of the earliest Israelite settlements is Canaanite, and the alphabet is early Canaanite. Almost the sole marker distinguishing Israelite villages from Canaanite sites is an absence of pig bones.


**The Exodus story gives several clues to a late 7th 

A. Israel’s alleged home in Egypt, not Bronze Age Egypt.

B. The Exodus writer gives no name of any Pharaoh at the alleged time of Joseph or Moses. The Exodus author’s avoidance of king/pharaoh names suggests the objective is something less then an accounting of datable

C. The Exodus writer does name the ""Philistines"" stating God would ""not lead them through the land of the Philistines"" (Ex 13:17)

D. The Exodus writer is ignorant of the Egyptian forts in northern Sinai or the Egyptian strongholds in Canaan


**No signs of national chaos or collapse**

All of the dates put forward by advocates of the historicity of Exodus fail to correspond to any period of national weakness or chaos in Egypt


**Was An Exodus Even Possible in the Late Bronze Age 1550-1150 BCE or Time of Raamses II ?**

 The traditional Exodus date of 1447 BCE falls in the reign of Tuthmosis III or Amenophis II. Egypt’s hegemony throughout Canaan continued through the Late Bronze Age until challenged by The Sea Peoples invasion of the 10th century.

The 14th century el-Amarna 400 letters of the cuneiform archive found at Tell el-Armarna in Egypt describe in great detail social, military, demographic conditions both within and between these nations. In addition 10,000 cuneiform tablets were found at Boghazkoy , Asia Minor. The letters and tablets make no mention of an ""Israel"".


The Merneptah stele (upright stone slab) dated 1207 BCE is the first mention of ""Israel"" found in Egypt describing Raamses II’ son

**No sign of the Israelites in the wilderness**

Modern archaeological techniques are no longer limited to trowels and brushes. Satellite imagery and ground-penetrating radar are just some of the sophisticated equipment utilized enabling archaeologists to trace even the most meager remains of hunter-gathers and pastoral nomads all over the world. Indeed

In the case of Israel,000 Israelites. Yet, repeated surveys at Kadesh-Barnea where Israel spent 38 of its 40 years have not provided the slightest evidence of an Israelite encampment. Ezion-geber, a camping place of Israel has not produced a trace of evidence. Twenty years of intensive excavations at Tel Arad (Num 21:1-3) where Israel allegedly did battle with King Arad has provided no Late Bronze Age remains. Tel Hesbon, the site of Hesbon (Num21:21-35) where Israel allegedly did battle with the king of the Amorites provides no Bronze Age remains.


**Summary** 

The evidence for a largely indigenous origin of Israelites is overwhelming. The Exodus story was probably written five to seven hundred years after it was supposed to have happened. The Egyptians have virtually no records of the Israelites

All the above indicates that the exodus was not a historical event.

These are some of the major findings - obviously if I dump everything the post will be too long and that doesn't foster discussion

The exact nature of the causal link is less clear and still being debated. But the general picture seems to be that religion fosters social support, promotes a healthy lifestyle, positive beliefs and emotions etc. For example, one model *(Levin 2003, 2001, pp. 71–72)* suggests that (1) religious commitment and identification promotes (2) healthy behaviors, social support practices, which then lead to (3) positive emotions and associated physiological effects.

One should not forget that these results are large group averages and won't be reflective of every single religious individual or group. Nonetheless

1337358317.0,ttfyn,To All: A long-winded clarification on what nihilism is.,develdevil,49,11,151,"Yesterday

Let's start with atheism, it would follow that everything that happened after the creation of the universe is similarly borne of natural occurrences:

Stars form and die. Planets form. Life begins as an improbable-yet-natural occurrence. Life evolves. Organisms develop various abilities, atomic and energy reactions.

Notice how, and it all started without agency.

Now let's look at the words ""meaning"" and ""purpose."" Both imply that there is a value that something is imbued with

I'm not going to explicitly define intelligence here to anyone's satisfaction. I think we all have a good idea of what it means, to reason, to realize, to simulate, etc. The most important aspect of intelligence, however, is agency. That is

Now, our reality is nothing but the sum of all the events before that moment, and these events are subject to unintelligent laws of physics, it then follows that we are not intelligent, but rather we are experiencing the illusion of being intelligent. We lack the agency necessary to fulfill the requirements of intelligence. In turn this means that no intelligence actually exists.

In sum

**That realization... that reality... is nihilism.**

Now it's time for a nihilism FAQ:

Q: If there is no meaning or purpose

A: This is a question that people ask because they think nihilism is an angsty/emo/depressive argument. It isn't. Nihilism is an observation of reality. There's no emotion or distress attached to it. Thus

Q: What motivates a nihilist?

A: We are still biological entities. Our bodies need food, friends, etc. It's not like once you realize that there is no point to anything your body just shuts down. We've always been slaves to our biological urges. Even people who claim to have transcended them are still just listening to their biological urges, they've only convinced their selves that their urges come from another place.

Q: Why don't you adopt a purpose?

A: There is a distinction between objective and subjective purpose and meaning. I acknowledge that there is no objective meaning or purpose to anything. I also acknowledge that any subjective meaning or purpose that I assign to something is only valid within the scope of my own mind. In this way

How do you justify this?,IncredibleBenefits,55,15,239,"*This was written in response to a different thread and my purpose changed to making a standalone post roughly halfway through the writing. I also had to heavily edit it to get it under the character limit. As a consequence of these some of the language will likely be awkward.* 

I am going to make the argument that even if the only parts of the NT a Christian believes to be authentic and true are 1-3 they are almost certainly still guilty of cherry picking.

1. Christians believe Jesus lived, by definition (as defined in the NT), a Christian.

2. This aforementioned definition was largely codified by Paul (the founder of the Church); you can't call yourself a Christian because you've met the requirements as given by Paul and not take his other teachings as authentic and true. Well, you've failed to explain how you aren't a cherry picker.

3. Christians belief the sayings of Jesus as represented in the bible are authentic and true. I think it's pretty safe to say that this is more or less universally true of all Christians; If you don't believe Jesus' own teachings then there's probably not a lot of point identifying as a Christian.  

**Concerning (1)**

How does one justify the belief that the OT is not literally true (because it's full of crazy stories like Jonah and the Fish, the Creation story, Noah's ark, etc.) but still hold the fantastic belief that Jesus *died and rose from the dead*? To me this seems like the very definition of cherry picking.

**Concerning (2) Paul's teachings on women in the Church**

Paul says here that women *shouldn't even talk* in church. Women talk in most churches every Sunday. Does singing count? If you walk into any church on Sunday you'll find a hell of a lot of women singing praise songs.

&gt;""As in all the churches of the saints, as even the law says. If there is anything they desire to know, let them ask their husbands at home. For **it is shameful for a woman to speak in church**"" (1 Corinthians 14:33-36)

Here he says that women shouldn't ever teach men and again reminds them to shut the hell up.  Any church with a female pastor

&gt;""But **I do not allow a woman to teach or exercise authority over a man**. She must remain silent."" (1 Timothy 2:12)

And here he says women need to bear children. So women that don't have children (are you screwed if you're barren?) aren't listening to Paul.

&gt;""But she will be delivered through childbearing

**Concerning (3) Jesus' own teachings**

**Sinning**

This one comes first because Jesus views on sinning will be important later. Whether or not Jesus meant this literally (I'm inclined to say no) isn't the point here. The point here is that any time Jesus says that something is a sin he doesn't just mean ""Don't do it"", don't fucking do it.""**

&gt;""But I tell you that anyone who looks at a woman lustfully has already committed adultery with her in his heart. **If your right eye causes you to sin

**On the OT and the Law**

Jesus flat out says that you need to obey OT law in all its ridiculous glory (no mixing ~~fabrics~~ wool and linen for example). To be fair Jesus has very ""liberal"" interpretations of OT but still

&gt;""Do not think that I [Jesus] have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them.  I tell you the truth, not the least stroke or a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished.""**  (Matthew 5:17-18)"" 

To put this next quote in context YSK that the belief in Jesus' day was that Moses literally wrote the first 5 books of the bible himself (even though his death/funeral is included in one of them

&gt;Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples: ""The teachers of the law and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat.  So you must obey them and do everything they tell you. But do not do what they do

**On Divorce**

Jesus stance on divorce is more or less ""don't do it"" (I've had to omit Matthew's version where he makes this more clear due to length). Adultery is a sin and we've already gone over Jesus' stance on sinning. It's worth noting that teachings that show up in more than one place are generally given more weight; there's also a version of this in Mark (it's considered certain that Luke/Matthew both had copies of Mark but that's not generally taught in Church).

&gt; ""**Every one who divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery

Mark's version:

&gt; And he said to them, she commits adultery."" (Mark 10:11-12)

**On Forgiveness and Violence**

Here Jesus makes it pretty clear that we shouldn't commit violence for pretty much any reason; at least, bite me. The point is that any Christian that commits violence or condones it goes against Jesus' teachings.

&gt;""You have heard that it was said, do not resist an evil person. **If someone strikes you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also.""**  (Matthew 5:38-39)

**On Material Wealth and Possessions**

Last but not least, I think it's called cherry picking like a motherfucking pro.

&gt;""It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of God."" (Mark 10:25)

Again, teachings that show up in more than one place are generally given more authority.

&gt;""And when Jesus saw that he became sorrowful

If you don't sell your possessions you're a cherry picker. Of course

&gt;""**Sell your possessions and give to charity**; make yourselves money belts which do not wear out

In fact

&gt;**""Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth**, there your heart will be also…No one can serve two masters; for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon."" (Matthew 6:19-24)

**Conclusion**

I'm sure some of these points can be proven wrong but unless you can prove all of them wrong I posit that you are guilty of cherry picking in the first degree. The points on Paul are the shakiest considering that he almost certainly didn't write 1 Timothy but that's not really the point, to accept many Christian teachings.  How do you figure out what's right and what's wrong?  Isn't it still cherry picking if you do decide certain parts are wrong? Why would God allow teachings into the NT that are false?  On what authority can you throw out certain teachings in the NT?  These kinds of questions are difficult to answer.  If you admit that you cherry pick the NT then I think you need to address at least a few of these or you're essentially building your own religion tailored to suit your needs without justification.

**Notes**:  I know my tone is flippant and I don't mean to offend, 1). If you don't believe any of 1-3 can you at least address why you don't and/or attempt to answer some of the questions I've raised in the conclusion?

Maybe a good way to deal with this problem is to try to avoid making sweeping statements about large groups, ..."", instead of just saying ""atheists think this"" or ""all Christians believe X"".

2. Part of the problem is caused by the inherent tension that is present in the stance that is often claimed by atheists

3. Another tension that is somewhat related to this and is perhaps [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) specific is the inherent moral ambiguity of the discussion about religion. On the one hand there are all these accusations toward and complaints about religion that usually litter the frontpage of [/r/atheism](/r/atheism) which obviously have a moral component (implicit is ""this should not be happening"" or ""this is evil/not good"").

It's too low

It's too high, and now the people who were complaining about tone in the first place can complain that the bar was set so high it doesn't do anything, and since the mod is an evil anti-theist he did it on purpose.

This is why I don't want to start moderating content beyond removing spam and badly off-topic posts.  

The crux of the issue:  no method for enforcing the 'Be nice to one another' rule will satisfy everyone.  The question then becomes ""What is the best way to enforce this rule that will please the MOST people?""

YOU, the insulting comments, etc.  If you don't like the way someone is referring to your cherished beliefs, *then quit talking to them.*  You are under **no obligation** to feed the trolls.

It appears to me that it's a minority who wish to stifle expression to protect their delicate sensibilities.  Even with the shit-storm I started yesterday

In the NT Jesus lineage is written twice, they're there to give claim to Christ's legal and patriarchal right as the messiah. They specifically mention characters like Noah and Adam and Enoch and Abraham (though I think Abraham is literal, I think) to sort of piece it all together. This falls right in line with the fact that Christ was supposed to tie in to the OT prophecies in Psalms, Jeremiah, Isaiah, Deuteronomy and others (not disputed...I don't think but I wouldn't be surprised).

http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Peter+2&amp;version=NIV

*4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but protected Noah, a preacher of righteousness, and seven others; 6 if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah by burning them to ashes, and made them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly; 7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man, who was distressed by the depraved conduct of the lawless 8 (for that righteous man, was tormented in his righteous soul by the lawless deeds he saw and heard)— 9 if this is so

This is written in such non-allegorical language its hard for me to fathom that he's being figurative here. I think, but as far as I know, we don't.

1337871514.0,u2tn2,"To Christians: Why I, as a gay man, find the story of Sodom brings up a moral point",Eyulfable,47,124, they usually think it's about how wrong being gay is

Most Christians have heard the story of how an entire town tried to have sex with 2 angels and ended up being destroyed. If you don't

The problem with it is that, then they will be spared. That doesn't cause a problem until you think of how the people that tried to rape the men were all called ""men and children.""

Considering that about 50% of a given population is female, I could say that women were also involved in the raping process. Heck, if the kids were there, why not bring the whole family. **Please not the *HEAVY* sarcasm in that sentence.** With women being involved, that would mean that homosexuality couldn't have been the cause, because both of the angels were men.

If it wasn't homosexuality that was the downfall of Sodom

However, not to homosexuality, but to inhospitality, which is completely different from the idea of raping an angel.

That's about as far as most people for gay rights get on the issue of Sodom
Isaiah 1
Jeremiah 23:14
Matthew 10:24-15
Luke 10:7-16
Jude verse 7
Jeremiah 49:18
Ezekiel 16:49-50

Both Matthew and Luke refer to the sin of Sodom being inhospitality

In Isaiah 1, seriously, if that chapter was written today, you could see it as smack talk and just replace any mention of ""Sodom"" with ""Communist"" or a synonym for a cigarette. Except no mention of homosexuality.

In Jeremiah 23

2 Peter 6-8 says that Sodom was destroyed because it was ungodly

Jude verse 7 is where some would hit a snag. The verse does say in its English form that the sins committed were a bunch of sexual no-nos such as fornication, the first mention of homosexuality.

However, but with the fact that there were also women in Sodom, it wouldn't be logical to assume that was it. Technically, angels aren't human, so having sex with one could be considered bestiality. Angels could be considered other flesh, so it fits.

Ezekiel 16:49-50 is another big one. It states that the sins of Sodom were arrogant, didn't help the poor, laziness, and did an abomination in front of him. Most people think that this is a reference to being gay, and therefor makes being gay wrong, but there are 2 things wrong about this notion. The first is that the abomination is never technically mentioned, and there are several abominations mentioned in Leviticus. Heck

But considering homosexuality is already an abomination in Leviticus, Jesus went against cultural norms of the time by teaching to turn the other cheek.

What is everyone's thoughts on this?

Now imagine that you repeat this experiment,000 pebbles you will find that distribution of pebbles in the bucket will follow a [power law distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_law_distribution).  a few buckets will have far more pebbles than the others, and most buckets will only have a handful.  The power law means that tiny differences between the buckets becomes magnified over time.  This is sometimes known as the 80:20 rule (approximately 20% of the buckets will have 80% of the pebbles, and vice versa), or a [Pareto Distribution](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution).  We see this distribution in any situation where several entities are competing for a resource, and getting that resource increases their ability to get more.  For example the size of cities, personal wealth, and if you run the simulation several times you will find the same distribution each time

Now imagine a world with 100 competing religions - they all start off small, and more ""brand recognition"".  It is inevitable that some religions will grow larger and come to dominate while others will stagnate or die completely (since in this scenario people can leave religions as well as join them, and when a religion has zero followers it becomes extinct).  However the religions that come to dominate do so purely because of the power law, not because those religions have any greater truth than those that wither, but simply through luck.  If you wound back time and run it again you would still have a few large dominant religions, but they would have different names and beliefs.  

This is why I dismiss any arguments that because a religion has been around for a long time or has billions of supporters then it must have some element of truth.

Now I know these are different sects of the same religion so of course they are going to have different philosophies, and it could be something as simple as one person feeling it is slightly more important to go to church every sunday than another.

But if everyone has slight different nuances and their own subjective interpretations of each religion, because religions are made essentially of rules and doctrines, and subjectively, we all alter those rules and doctrines, or at least interpret the weight of them diffrently. By this way of thinking, you are changing the nature of a set of rules, if you change your interpretation of the mona lisa painting and say its a dude

Now if we base a religion on its holy texts, you are removing those ideas from the context as a whole, creating something different.

This is not like having a subjective interpretation of a harry potter book. people will get different reactions and symbolism from the story, but chapter 14 was actually part of the plot.

## The Argument

#### Simplified argument (**TL;DR here**)

1. Objective moral values exist
2. God is morally all good
3. The actions of God are morally all good
4. God does not intervene to prevent suffering (by valuing free will more)
5. Not intervening to prevent suffering is the morally good decision

If anyone disagrees with 5

#### Colloquial argument

For those that believe in an all good God, and hence the former God is not all good. Most people do not challenge this, they instead embrace it, and they seek to determine God's will through various holy texts and commandments, assuming that this is the best way to find the word of God and therefore the manual on how to live a good life. I prefer another tactic: I ask ""What would Jesus do?"", or more aptly, ""What would God do?"". And if I were a theist, for I would believe in the existence of some all good God

Now, even if the intended consequence did not occur and the intended victim survived.

We now have something to work with: we know a value decision made by a perfect

## The Application

Put yourself in the shoes of an ordinary civilian, but is very interesting: *For the man to be significantly free has to be able to choose to rape the woman, and then has to be able to physically rape the woman. For the woman to be significantly free, she has to choose not to be raped, and then be able to have this choice fulfilled in reality.* In either scenario someone's free will is impinged. This by itself should break the free will defence, but I will continue.

The civilian observer now has a choice, then things change. The civilian only has to figure out what God would do in order to determine the most moral course of action (remember, if morals are a universal truth what is right and wrong will not change through any perspective, whether it be God or human, as that immediately violates the definition of objective and becomes subjective). Now, it is obvious the value decision God has made: He values the will of the rapist to rape over the combined will of the female not to be raped, and the suffering she is undergoing and will undergo in the future. So the civilian, can immediately logically deduce that

If he does **not** walk home

********
--------


## Expected Counter arguments

1. **What is right for God to do is different to what is right for people to do** - This counterargument violates the definition of objective morality, the nature of the agent plays no part in the moral scenario, which, for the example above is simply one person raping another. Does it matter if the observer is male, female, white, black, tall
2. **If God intervened all the time right and wrong are meaningless** - I am not arguing for a God that intervenes whenever you might say a bad word in public, and still attempted to rape.
3. **God is mysterious** - Playing the mystery card
4. **What is right is what God wants, would you do it because it is the ""right"" thing to do. Also, your morality is now based off the whims of an deity, not off a rational foundation of the well being of conscious creatures, and I would assert that secular morality is therefore superior.
5. **God is testing us in those situations to see if we still make the right choice** - Which would explain why when there is no one to test
6. **All suffering has a purpose, in fact it reinforces it, providing more reason not to intervene when God doesn't.

1337794738.0,u1aox,To all: Does conceivability entail the logical possibility of Superman?,GoodDamon,50,10,85,"This post is inspired by a recent conversation I had with our resident Thomist

&gt; *Prima facie

A lot of theistic philosophy relies on the idea that conceivability entails logical possibility. That is to say, even if it is physically impossible in our world.

The example hammie used, he's inhumanly strong, he shoots frickin' laser beams from his eyes, etc... Yet we can all visualize him, we can all conceive of him, and the argument goes that since this is so, there are at least some [possible worlds](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Possible_world) in which he could exist.

In contrast, the square circle is logically impossible. There is no possible world in which a square could also be a circle without redefining them.

But is the physically impossible still logically possible

I argue that Superman is not logically possible, the scale at which he becomes something I *can't* actually conceive of. I reduce him to logically invalid math.

Let's assign some numbers to Superman's energy input and output. Superman gets his energy primarily from the Sun; he is rarely depicted as needing to eat much, even if Superman is a 100% efficient solar cell -- that is, every photon that his body absorbs is converted to a form of energy he can use -- he still has a massive energy deficit compared to his output. His powers include:

* Flight
* Super strength
* Super breath
* Super hearing
* Super vision (x-ray
* Super speed
* Etc.

Let's say Superman's energy input from the Sun is 3 units a day. And again, we're no longer talking about Superman as we've conceived of him -- we've reduced Superman to something we **can't** conceive of. Try visualizing 3 being greater than 9. You can't. It's a logical impossibility.

So merely by zooming in

Have I missed anything? Is there a way to make Superman logically possible while still being Superman?

I contend that all physical impossibilities that we can conceive of are similarly reducible to logical impossibilities. But if I'm right about Superman

Let g be an entity that has the following properties:

*  g necessarily exists

This g is our necessary creator being. Now


Premise: if X is a cause of Y

X is a cause of Y  =&gt;  P(Y|X) &gt; P(Y)

The reasoning behind this premise should be clear. If event Y were just as likely to occur whether or not X did, since it is actively impeding Y's existence, not facilitating it. This leaves the only possible relationship as the one given.

By applying this premise

*  P(X|G) &gt; P(X)

*  P(G) = 1

However

      P(X) 
    
    = P(X|G)*P(G) + P(X|¬G)*P(¬G)

I could understand this in any other Christian sect because they take personal approaches to truth and revelation.  Most Christians I've known have simply packed up and changed churches or denominations when they disagree with a stance their church has made.

First, I do not believe in any gods (atheist), but neither do I believe I could prove conclusively that no gods exist (agnostic).

**A little history about myself**

Unlike a lot of the atheists you'll encounter, channeling, chakras, homeopathy, spiritual aliens, reincarnation... nothing was too woo-woo for my parents. So my perspective on Christianity, Islam, Shinto

Now, and dangerous in some ways. For example, homeopathy isn't medicine, it's a glorified -- and expensive -- placebo.

But all in all, and there was no such thing as Hell.

In fact, they haven't pretended to know.

So I was left with a vague feeling that ""something"" happened after death

**How I became less happy with that**

I've gone over this a number of times in my head and in words

A primary factor is my gut instinct to reject unfounded claims. I've always been a bit of a skeptic in other matters, I was more of a deist than a believer in the religion of my parents. I didn't think anything magical ever really happened in the real world, and the various stories were just that: Stories. I envisioned God and an afterlife as only existing outside of space and time. So even at a young age, I doubted.

And I thought most of the stuff coming from organized religions was bunk. Frankly, I heard the ideas that Hell is actually just the absence of God, or that it's where nonbelievers and sinners somehow choose to go, but since I never was a Christian, I always thought these notions were bullshit cop-outs. Even my young mind knew it didn't make any sense, and figured it was just a scare tactic to ensure more followers.

As an adult, Scientology did not hold up to skeptical scrutiny, and I found myself mentally picking apart every ridiculous claim they made. It was so obviously a money scam, it wasn't even funny.

And then there was 9/11. For a while, their claims seemed to make sense, and considering the craven behavior Dick Cheney has always shown, I felt the (wholly unexamined) evidence of his involvement was pretty strong. Then I examined the evidence, and it blew apart like wet tissue paper in a strong wind.

At this point, I found it just as lacking in evidence as any outlandish conspiracy theory, alternative medicine hoax, or the religions I'd been witness to from the outside.

**What put me over the top**

Most people find the birth of their first child to be a ""spiritual"" event. I certainly did. It's hard to express the combination of joy, and other intense emotions that accompany it. If you're a parent, you know. If not, you won't understand it until you become a parent.

There were some unexpected side effects, abused, starved, hurting, or dead children. The idea of their pain and deaths horrified me far beyond what it would have prior to my daughter's birth. For maybe a full year, I assiduously avoided such news stories, because each one was like a sucker-punch to the gut.

But inevitably, right? I didn't think those deaths were actually the end of those people, did I?

Well, let me tell you. Try to imagine being raised in a feel-good religion where everything works out fine, you get to be reincarnated or advance to a ""higher plane of existence,"" and there's no Hell. Realizing I'd lost that really hurt. My beliefs, however tenuous, had all of the afterlife Happy Funland promises of religion without all the jerking-off-means-you-go-to-Hell bullshit. So what was making those news stories painful was the realization that those kids never got a fair shot, then were irrevocably snuffed out.

As an empathetic human being

**But I got over it**

So here we are today. I'm a better person than I was before. I give more to charities. I volunteer. I give to the homeless. I do all this because what matters isn't saving the soul I don't believe exists. What matters is reducing misery **now**.

I can't make those kids come back to life. Their deaths are unnecessary, and if I could, I would. I would bring them back to life, I would make them well fed, loved, and cared for. I would, but I can't.

Here's what I can do. I can recognize that our time is limited. Living for an afterlife isn't living at all, I realized that no time is more important than right now, no matter when ""right now"" happens to be. If I'm not doing what I can to ease the burdens and miseries of those less fortunate than myself, putting my energies into goals that I've set for myself, or otherwise working to be a source of happiness in the world, I'm squandering the incredible luck I have to be alive.

**So here we are**

I'm a science fan

* **Dualism** - The mind is a collection of neurological actions and reactions, wonderful thing. But it does mean the mind stops when we die, in much the same way that a song disappears once you stop singing it.
* **Souls** - There is no evidence of a soul, or other supernatural component of our essences. And that's OK. Being my body is OK.
* **Intelligent design** - The evidence in favor of evolution by natural selection is compelling.
* **God** - There is no evidence of gods. Books that claim to be the word of gods aren't evidence, and generally boil down to special pleading or other fallacies. One can no more argue God into existence outside of the universe (if such a concept even makes sense) than one can argue a chair into existence inside of the universe. The very best arguments result in an uninvolved deistic creator that may or may not be sentient, and whose existence bears not at all upon our own.

&gt;*Abstract: People often reason egocentrically about others' beliefs, and neuroimaging evidence suggests that people may be even more egocentric when reasoning about a religious agent's beliefs (e.g., God). In both nationally representative and more local samples, people's own beliefs on important social and ethical issues were consistently correlated more strongly with estimates of God's beliefs than with estimates of other people's beliefs (Studies 1–4). Manipulating people's beliefs similarly influenced estimates of God's beliefs but did not as consistently influence estimates of other people's beliefs (Studies 5 and 6). A final neuroimaging study demonstrated a clear convergence in neural activity when reasoning about one's own beliefs and God's beliefs, but clear divergences when reasoning about another person's beliefs (Study 7). In particular, reasoning about God's beliefs activated areas associated with self-referential thinking more so than did reasoning about another person's beliefs. Believers commonly use inferences about God's beliefs as a moral compass, but that compass appears especially dependent on one's own existing beliefs.*

1365691816.0,1c4y0s,To atheists: There is no contradiction between God’s omniscience and free will (WARNING: Long Argument),jez2718,70,34,261,"I made a post on this topic a few days that generated some good discussion

##Clarifications
First off, as it will then be the determinism that is in contradiction with free will and not God’s existence or attributes. Unless, that is, you can argue that God’s attributes entail determinism, which is the thesis I shall try to demonstrate is false. Similarly, it is not a criticism of my argument if the concept of free will is incoherent.

Secondly
&gt;Omniscience is the property of knowing all things that it is not logically contradictory to know.

Some of you may object to this added caveat

##Groundwork
We will need to begin with some metaphysical groundwork on the nature of time, the Eiffel Tower exists but Gandhi and any future Moon colony do not exist. The second view is called the Growing Block theory, which is like Presentism but allows for the existence of past objects. Both Presentism and Growing Block are in agreement about the non-existence of any future objects, events etc. 

The third main view on the other hand argues for the reality of the future and is called Eternalism. Eternalism takes its cue from physics and argues that time is just another dimension

My thesis is that whichever of these three views you accept

##Presentism/Growing Block
The basic problem here is that as under these views there are no future objects or events. Therefore both future me and my future choices do not exist. Therefore there can be no facts pertaining to how I will choose and hence it is not logically possible for God to know my future actions. Thus omniscience under this framework does not entail foreknowledge and so there is no contradiction with free will. 

To properly articulate this argument (in response to objections raised by /u/MaybeNotANumber) we will consider a simple model. Suppose we have a true random number generator that will output some integer at future time T. Call the present time t (t&lt;T). Consider the claims “The output at time T is even” and “The output at time T is odd”. **At time t**

To answer this we employ [Russell's Theory of Descriptions](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descriptions/#RusTheDes) which analyses the former statement as making three claims:

1. There exists an output at time T
2. There is at most one output at time T
3. Whatever is an output at time T is even (for the latter statement this just changes from ‘even’ to ‘odd’)

Now the output at time T is a state of the machine at time T

We may further supplement this point by appeal to the [correspondence theory of truth](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth/#CorThe) which states that “p is true if and only if p corresponds to some actual state of affairs”. Thus a claim about some future event can only be true if it corresponds to a future state of affairs. But as there are no future states of affairs (as there are no future objects) then no such claim can be true. Now what holds for the random number generator also holds for any free agent

MaybeNotANumber tries to avoid this critique by arguing that the output at time T exists as a concept rather than as an actual object. He thus considers the claims as statements of the form “If time = T then the output is …”. This would seem to run into the difficulty of us having two equally valid concepts of the output, whilst the claims being considered are clearly referring to actual, mind-independent events. We must distinguish between truths of such things and truths of concepts. For example “Pegasus has wings” may be true of the *concept of Pegasus*, but is not true of the thing Pegasus as there is no such thing. Thus this objection seems not to succeed.  

Thus

##Eternalism
In the groundwork we described how the Eternalist (‘Block’) universe looks from a timeless perspective as every event happening at once. This is the view that God is supposed to have, because the *reason* that God sees them as what they are **is because that was how I chose to act**. If I had chosen to do Y instead of X then God would have timelessly known that I did Y, but I chose to do X and so he timelessly knows that I did X. My choosing is causally prior to God knowing what I chose*. A key premise of this is of course that God is timeless. If you think he isn't (or that the concept is meaningless) that is the avenue you should take in refuting classical theism, not omniscience/free-will.

/u/Deggit presents an ingenious response to this argument based on that other attribute of God as the creator of the universe. Consider the two versions of me mentioned above. Call the one that chose X X-me and the one that chose Y Y-me. These entities are totally distinguishable beings under Eternalism
&gt;The whole point is that God has timeless knowledge from the moment of creation that you are X-You. When you get to the choice-moment you **will** pick X. You will feel as if you are picking X for entirely reasonable reasons. The choice will feel free

&gt;The lack of freedom enters the equation with God being the one who deliberately and knowledgeably approved of X-You existing. If God didn't want X-You to exist

Thus not only does it seem that I have no free-will if there is an omniscient creator, the direct result of God’s choices at creation.
 
However there is perhaps a loophole to avoid to this conclusion. This requires a couple of axioms that seem plausible

1. X-me and Y-me are both numerically one and the same individual (me) with different 4-D profiles
2. Pre-creation a free individual has an indeterminate 4-D profile (note: I could do with an explanation by a theologian as to what exactly happens when God creates a being to come to an informed opinion as to the truth of this axiom)

Given these two axioms we can then consider Gods creation process as God chooses to create the singular individual ‘me’ (as well as every other thing in the existence) which has an indeterminate 4-D profile

I think on balance I favour the view that pre-creation there is a universe with determined initial conditions(/set of initial conditions) and fixed physical laws

^*This ^is ^difficult ^to ^adequately ^describe ^because ^English ^words ^are ^temporal

I gave God my requirements, the bare minimum for me to mentally be able to believe at all, yet even those requirements remained (and still remain) unfulfilled. To me God's complete absence, his act of completely ignoring my simple requirements that were made not out of pride or angst but out of simple necessity, was proof to me that there was no God, devoid of personality or empathy (not that that necessarily would detract from a  deity).

Why do so many people think that ""gnostic atheism"" is not a position that can be maintained and that ""agnostic atheism"" is somehow a higher state of being?


My confusion has always been this (I will try to describe it as best as possible): 

If you tell me that there is an invisible pink unicorn that follows you around and offer no evidence or further reason to believe you I will say with 99.9% certainty (0.1% margin for error) that it does not exist. No one I think would disagree with my assessment; No evidence

So I ask

When people present groundless claims are we expected to maintain and label our agnosticism to all of them? Should we remain agnostic to Russell's Tea Pot? Sure

- **Because the ideas are old?** No religion still active today is older than 3
- **Because the stories had to come from somewhere?** Imagination is nifty thing that humans possess.
- **Because similar idea are seen in multiple distinct cultures?** Stories of wizards are found in many different distinct cultures... Does that mean there were once wizards on which all the stories are based?
- **~~**Because it is more intellectually honest to admit we don't know?** Is it? At some point we need to admit to ourselves that it doesn't matter and there is absolutely no evidence so to maintain the position of ""I don't know"" is pointless - declare certainty and move on. (Also back to dismissing other groundless claims which we do regularly and back to why are god/gods special)~~** *Thinking back
- **Because we will never know what triggered the universe?** So be agnostic to deism - that actually makes a little more sense... Agnosticism towards theism on the other hand is mental masturbation - Direct claims are made about theistic gods (answer prayers

Further food for thought:

We dismiss Scientology easily because we know who (L. Ron Hubbard) made it up and when (lots of people alive today actually remember)... Just because we don't know exactly who made up Christianity for example doesn't somehow protect it from being labelled fiction. We do know when it was created and it was no where near the beginning of life or even homosapien man for that matter

On that line of reasoning: did Jehovah have multiple personalities back in the day? Were the Egyptians just worshipping the same being as multiple deities? Were their stories completely different because God was speaking Greek to them and they didn't understand it? Was it not until the people in Biblical times came along they could actually communicate with Jehovah and record the correct stories and single personality (omitting the thousands of years prior because Jehovah decided he didn't like the Egyptians who worshipped him as like 20 people)? 

Just because these older ideas didn't spring up from nowhere during our life times doesn't mean that they didn't just spring up in the exact same was as Mormonism, etc.

**TL;DR:** Isn't it more honest to say one is an agnostic in regards to deism than to say they are agnostic to theism as we dismiss claims from recent religions (Scientology et all) quite easily and nothing except age really separates them from older claims like those of Christianity. Maintaining agnosticism to all baseless claims is pointless

**Edit**: I should note we can use arguments that we use against theism against agnostic atheism as well:  
&gt; No one would tell you that it's intellectuality superior to be agnostic about the existence of Zeus

**EDIT 2:** Maybe I should clarify my overall position... If you label yourself an atheist, why do we need the label? I do not believe in god/gods with as close to certainty as possible, I can never be 100% but I do not feel we need to label that uncertainty as we would not label it for Xenu. This is not a question of ""does agnosticism exist"" because really it's just a definition, the question is more ""is it important to call ones self an agnostic to god/gods when we do not use the label in other areas of uncertainty.""

The polytheistic nature of this passage became clear with the discovery in 1929 of Ugarit (related to Hebrew) texts in modern-day Syria at Ras Shamra.  The texts confirmed some of the names of Israel’s deities including Elyon.

In fact, divided up the earth and his son Yahweh received the portion of the earth that came to be known as Israel.

http://triangulations.wordpress.com/2010/05/09/deuteronomy-328-9/

Literary and conceptual parallels discovered in the literature of Ugarit, El (who, like the God of the Bible, is also referred to as El Elyon, the ""Most High"") fathered seventy sons, thereby specifying the number of the ""sons of El"" (Ugaritic, bn il). An unmistakable linguistic parallel with the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint reading was thus discovered

3 Defend the weak and the fatherless;
    uphold the cause of the poor and the oppressed.
4 Rescue the weak and the needy;
    deliver them from the hand of the wicked.

5 “The ‘gods’ know nothing

6 “I said

""The final editors of the Hebrew canon were fervent monotheists, none of the available English translations does justice to the original Hebrew of Genesis 31:13, which quite simply reads ""I am the god Bethel"" ('El Bet'el), who was a member of the Canaanite pantheon along with the rest of the above.4 The original meaning is therefore quite different from the traditional understanding: this god at Bethel is not the universal Lord who appeared at Bethel but just one god among many – a local deity of a specific place.""

Throughout the ancient Semitic world

The God of Abraham and the God of Nahor, (Genesis 31:53, RSV)

Just like many of the other verses we have looked at

The Elohim of Abraham and the Elohim of Nahhor, and Jacob swore with the fear of his father Isaac.

Note that the Hebrew states,"" therefore we are looking at two different Elohim, one belonging to Abraham (the ancestor of Jacob) and the other to Nahhor (the ancestor of Laban). Because we are looking at two different Elohim, the Elohim in the phrase ""the Elohim of their father"" must be used in the plural sense.

But let’s say Jesus was just too much of a generalist to come right out and condemn any particular cruel practice. Maybe it’s up to each one of us to figure out for ourselves exactly what Jesus meant. 

But there is a problem with that theory. 

Jesus also said the Holy Spirit was going to come and guide his followers into “all truth”. 

So one would think that the apostles would have received from the Holy Spirit the revelation that this ""golden rule"" thing meant that slavery should not be practiced. After all

Instead the fact is that Peter and Paul were more concerned with changing people’s attitudes and behaviors in relation to pork and foreskins than they were with changing people’s attitudes and behaviors in relation to slavery. 

Obviously pork and foreskins are much higher priorities than human suffering but how can anyone justify the fact that it took the Holy Spirit Guided Body of Christ some 1500 years to even start to wonder if slavery might be wrong and only about 15 minutes to approve pork and deemphasize circumcision? 

Only one church father,500 years. And no other Church father or even one Pope could arrive at the conclusion or even speculate that *maybe* slavery was wrong until over 1500 years after the Holy Ghost started guiding the Body of Christ (the Church). But, by God, slaves and slaveowners alike could eat bacon.

And surely some Christian over the centuries should have felt led by the Holy Spirit to *actively* challenge the institution of slavery politically

2) God is infinitely complex and purposeful

3) God had to have had a designer???

1359480305.0,17i6ol,On [Plantinga's] Free Will Defense (by request),cabbagery,36,1,79,"For /u/abstrusities.

---

The 'Free Will Defense' (hereafter, and morally perfect, the presence of evil in the world seems to contradict the possibility that such a being could exist. Al Plantinga (and Peter van Inwagen, to name but two of the prominent theistic philosophers) claims that if there is an intrinsic good reaped from presence of free creatures in the world, then it may turn out that the presence of evil is compatible with this sort of god. I shall here briefly outline the FWD, and offer an argument for why it is flawed.

First,' 'morally perfect,' and 'free will' (or 'free creatures'):

* *Omnipotence* is, or square circles (though it can be argued that a circle with infinite radius is a square, or that a square with infinite side length or diagonal is a circle), or any other such nonsense. If *A* is logically possible, then an omnipotent being can do *A*, or make *A* obtain.

* *Omniscience* is, where 'knowledge' is the classical formula of 'justified, true belief' with some undefined Gettier qualifier.

* *Morally perfect* means that whatever moral system obtains

* *'Free will'* is the ability to do otherwise

I shall also assume *Compatibilism*

---

Plantinga's FWD: an overview
---

---

1. (Assumption) There is an intrinsic moral good realized from having free creatures in the world.
2. (Assumption) The moral good realized from having free creatures in the world [necessarily in all cases] outweighs any harm done from evil committed by these creatures.
3. (Definition) A morally perfect being would prefer a world in which the net moral good was necessarily positive (or maximized).
4. (Definition) An omnipotent being could create free creatures in the world.
5. (Definition) An omniscient being would know (3) and (4), moral goodness would yet be a net positive.
6. (Granted premise) Interfering with the free choices of free creatures would significantly diminish the moral good realized from having such creatures.
7. (Definition) God is defined as an omnipotent
8. (Conditional proof) Therefore, god would create free creatures with minimal interference in their free choices, such that the moral good from having free creatures outweighs the harm done from evil acts by them committed.
9. (Follows from (8)) Therefore

---

A problem of evidence
---

---

Insofar as this is not an exposition of the 'evidential' PoE

1. (Definition of soundness) If the FWD is sound
2. (From FWD premises) Therefore
3. (Evidence) But the intrinsic moral good realized from the existence of free creatures may in some cases be outweighed by the harm done from evil acts committed by these creatures.
4. (Definition) Therefore it is not the case that the intrinsic moral good realized from the existence of free creatures necessarily in all cases outweighs the harm done from evil acts committed by these creatures.
5. (*Modus Tollens*) Therefore

So what of this evidence in (3)? There is much here to be said, this counter-argument is valid. Its premises are all either definitions or drawn from the FWD's own premises, with the lone exception of (3) -- which is why it is the sticking point.

---

An arithmetic primer
---

---

The FWD relies heavily on its second premise: ""The moral good realized from having free creatures in the world [necessarily in all cases] outweighs any harm done from evil committed by these creatures."" The bracketed portion signifies the implicit modality and quantification of the claim, it must be the case that in that world the moral good outweighs the moral evil*. That is, FWD (3) has significant bearing on the logical space available to FWD (2).

Consider a pair of worlds, who is able to make exactly one morally significant free choice, and then the world is [by god] annihilated. Keeping the FWD in mind (as its premises, with exception of (2), are granted here), consider the net moral good realized in each world given the following arbitrarily assigned values:

World|MG(MFC)|MG(MSC)
|:-|:-|:
W^1 | 10 | 11
W^2 | 10 | 9

*(with MG(MFC) = moral good realized from the existence of a creature with free will

Note that W^1 is clearly a better world than W^2 . Now recall our definition of 'free will': *the ability to do otherwise*. This definition bears a modal claim that it is *possible* to do otherwise

World|n(MFC)|n(MSC)/n(MFC)|MG/MFC|net MG
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:
W^3 |2|2|10|20 + *x*

Note in this world that we have increased both the number of free creatures and the number of morally significant free choices. Note also that we have a variable *x*, which I shall do through a few scenarios (more are easily generated but unnecessary):

1. MFC(1) commits MSC(1) = MG(10) and MSC(2) = MG(10); MFC(2) commits MSC(1) = MG(10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10).

2. MFC(1) commits MSC(1) = MG(10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10); MFC(2) commits MSC(1) = MG(-10) and  MSC(2) = MG(-10).

3. MFC(1) commits MSC(1) = MG(-10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10); MFC(2) commits MSC(1) = MG(-10) and MSC(2) = MG(-10).

The outcomes of these scenarios

Scenario|net moral goodness
|:-|:
1|40
2|0
3|-20

Now, yet clearly a net positive moral goodness is not a foregone conclusion: it is possibly the case that the evil committed by free creatures can outweigh the moral good realized from their very existence. Of course, I've arbitrarily assigned numbers here, and limited the number of free choices significantly -- surely every day each of us faces thousands of morally significant choices. Driving oneself to work, for instance, provides the opportunity for as many morally significant choices as there are moments in which one might choose to collide with another vehicle or a pedestrian.

Hence

In order for FWD (2) to obtain, FWD(3) faces difficulty with the arithmetic, because whenever a finite value is provided for the existence of a free creature, the fact of 'free will' threatens the balance desired by a morally perfect being.

---

Objections and conclusion
---

---

The conclusion is plain enough to see: I take it that FWD(2) is untenable, I'll entertain only one objection here, and the rest in comments:

1\. *The inclusion of ""necessarily in all cases"" is neither a requirement nor really a part of Plantinga's FWD. Your argument pivots on that modal claim

Not quite. While I clearly added the explicit modality, implicit in Plantinga's version. In order for his argument to retain *validity*, it must be the case that it is possible for the moral good from free creatures to outweigh the moral evil by them committed. But this is a Pyhrric victory. To require only that it is *possible* that moral good outweighs moral evil in a world is insufficient for any being properly called 'morally perfect.' Surely any such being would seek to minimize the chance of moral evil. Couple this with the other attributes of god, and it's easy to see that as soon as the third scenario above obtains (read: Adam and Eve, Cain and Abel, etc.), an omnipotent (much less omniscient) being would seek to mitigate things and end the world.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/17i6ol/on_plantingas_free_will_defense_by_request/

I've often heard of people having a personal relationship with God, meditation, whatever. Some of them may even claim to see prayer as a 2 way communication, including everything from literally hearing the word of God to a simple feeling of reciprocation and that their words were heard. 

However, all that good stuff. Not once when I put my hands together and thought about God did I get even a hint of communication from them to me. It's not as if I wasn't trying; I had my own problems with life (and I won't bore you with them) that I sought guidance to get over at a young age (and I mean &lt;10), and I had heard constantly about how you could always ask God. So I did over and over again.

But I was never satisfied. People often describe a revelation of any kind as a ""click"" or ""light turned on"", it was as simple as asking for mere guidance. 

I've seen similar stories to mine all over the place

1371718542.0,1gptxm,To All: Why objective morality is an useless concept,dale_glass,51,13,93,"To start with

As I understand it

The first is the kind of thing Sam Harris proposes. A morality that (ideally) when followed by different people still comes to the same conclusions. For instance if ""good"" means ""minimizes suffering"", by doing a comparison. This kind of morality can have a subjective origin for its axioms (the decision to care about money above all is quite arbitrary), but once those are agreed on, the same conclusions should follow regardless of who is examining a situation. 

Universal morality on the other hand, even if some culture agrees among themselves they have no problem with it.

Here I will be talking about the second kind. I will be attempting to show that it's an useless and impossible in reality concept.


For a start, sticks a knife in your guts, and runs away with your wallet.

My point here is that claiming to be objectively right does you absolutely no good if people don't agree with you. The ""objectively"" part of the claim is effectively meaningless. Either people agree with what you're doing

The other problem is that objective morality doesn't have an objective beginning. Why should God's commands be followed? Because he's the creator of the universe? Because he's great? But deciding to care about greatness or creation is a personal decision. People aren't forced to obey the highest power.

Caring about God's wishes

Suppose my father gives me an ultimatum: ""You follow my rules

Same happens with God. I can make the personal decision that God's displeasure, then to myself, it is, and God not liking it isn't going to do anything to stop me.

A further problem is that God isn't here to answer questions, and which I deem more important. The multitude of Christian denominations shows this perfectly: there's no feedback that allows us to determine who got it right, and as a result religion keeps splintering. Martin Luther created an entire major branch out of disagreement on what's important.

But even if God were to make the exact rules perfectly clear, ""neighbor"" and ""as yourself"" mean, and it's quite clear that different people have different views of the meaning of that sentence.

So

* Subjectively choose a religion
* Subjectively choose a denomination
* Subjectively decide that I care about God
* Subjectively decide that I care about what God wants
* Subjectively determine the ordering of the rules
* Subjectively determine what does the rule mean exactly. Is it ""You shall not kill""
* Subjectively apply the rule. Ok

So, as all that it requires is to agree that suffering is bad, and the less of it, the better. 

TL;DR: Claiming your morality to be objective does nothing for you in an argument, all of which contaminates this objective morality with more subjectivity than found in secular alternatives.

* The old laws don't apply anymore. God made a new covenant when he brought Jesus into the world.
* These bits are only intended as metaphors.
* These bits are only intended as guidelines or illustrations.
* It is wrong to question the word of god.
* That it was right in the culture of the time.

I would like to offer another point of view: 

**If your holy book says something that is obviously wrong - either factually or morally - then your holy book has said something that is wrong.**

No, and another empty glass. *This real-world situation does not model arithmetic at this level of abstraction*. Despite the surface similarity between adding integers and putting the contents of two glasses together, they are fundamentally different. 

The failure of real-world situations to correspond to a similar-sounding logical structure gets much subtler than pouring water.  Some of the world's smartest people spend a lifetime studying logic and its real-world analogues, unlike philosophers. And they still [fail in disastrous ways](http://rdist.root.org/2009/05/28/timing-attack-in-google-keyczar-library/).  There's a lot of popular and academic writing on this problem under the name ""leaky abstractions."" 

So, or you could be working with an inapplicable model.  Unfortunately, there is no way to *logically prove* that your model is applicable. Your final uncertainty must be the probability that you made a logical mistake, multiplied by the probability that your model deviates from reality in some important way--and this latter probability is almost always underestimated, *especially* here.

1364167404.0,1axv4o,To atheists: turning pointy questions into arguments,Cituke,52,18,97,"So

It's things like:

- How do you justify God sending people to Hell if God is good?

- Why did God create the universe with so much empty space?

- Why doesn't God make himself obvious?

This isn't a bad thing because generally the more times a system of beliefs must respond with ""I don't know"" or come up with a flimsy response

But it isn't that strong.  After all

The ""method of pointy questions"" is by its nature very kind to atheism since atheists don't have much that they must defend.  The less beliefs you assert

What I would like to see more of though

Rephrasing one of my examples:

1. If there is extra space in the universe

2. There is extra space in the universe

3. Therefore God does not exist

You'll notice that this places the burden of evidence on the person making the argument whereas before they had just a question and no burden.  Yet if they can justify their premises as likely (or absolutely) true and have valid logic

In the same way the Alien Astronaut Theoriest might have to make an argument like this:

1. If mathematics unknown to the Egyptians is reflected in the building of the Pyramids then aliens helped build the pyramids

2. Such mathematics were reflected in the building of the pyramids

3. Therefore aliens helped build the pyramids

Clearly when put into place of making an assertion

The same might benefit our conversations here.  It's not that the atheists' case is on par with the Alien Astronaut Theorist

1345265608.0,yezcp,To all: On philosophical equivocation,GoodDamon,38,3,34,"Several recent posts on free will and determinism reminded me that I've been meaning to delve into the topic of the precision with which we define our words and terms.

One of the biggest problems with philosophy of religion seems to be a lack of rigor in the definitions used therein, it is patently obvious that William Lane Craig is using an overly-broad definition of ""begins to exist"" that intentionally avoids specifying the manner in which a thing begins existing. He has been called out on this, and has dug in his heels, claiming that it doesn't matter that his definition is broad enough to cover both the creation of new things out of old (clothing from wool, furniture from wood, etc.) and the creation of matter, space

Craig stands by this broad definition

His argument wouldn't work if he was more specific. If the Kalam's first premise was that ""everything that begins to exist *from pre-existing materials within a temporal framework* has an efficient cause, and the conclusion would be a non-sequitur. The only way to make it work would be to include an awful lot of wiggle room for rejecting the argument as a proof for God, such as putting it like this:

1. Everything that begins to exist from pre-existing materials within a temporal framework has an efficient cause.
2. The universe began to exist from either pre-existing materials within some sort of temporal framework
3. The universe either does or doesn't have an efficient cause.

Much more rigorous

Now let's look at some other problematic words and phrases from recent posts;

**Free will**

The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy defines free will [as follows](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/freewill/):
&gt; “Free Will” is a philosophical term of art for a particular sort of capacity of rational agents to choose a course of action from among various alternatives.

Hoo-boy... The lack of specificity in a definition like that speaks volumes for the coherency of the idea. And the encyclopedia acknowledges that fact with what immediately follows the definition:

&gt; Which sort is the free will sort is what all the fuss is about. (And what a fuss it has been: philosophers have debated this question for over two millennia

There are several main schools of thought regarding free will, and thereby declare that as we demonstrably have free will, determinism must be false. Compatibilists, as should be obvious, regard free will as real, but inextricable from causal reality, and thus compatible with determinism. Fatalists reject free will entirely

It should be noted that while most theists would take an incompatibilist stance and most atheists a compatibilist or fatalist stance

For our purposes here

* **Free will A**: “Free will” means the capability to logically analyze choices using the brain's available knowledge, and determine which choice is optimal. It is a purely deterministic process.

* **Free will B**: ""Free will"" means the capability to determine which choice is optimal in a way that is not determined by the brain's knowledge

Obviously,"" it's almost certain he's using the *A* version (or something similar), which describes decision-making in the context of inescapably deterministic factors. When an incompatibilist says ""free will,"" she is declaring it to be antithetical to determinism. The incompatibilist's idea of free will pre-supposes non-deterministic reality, so obviously our ability to make choices rules determinism out, while the compatibilist's idea of free will rejects non-physical sources of decision-making, so of course it's compatible with determinism.

The thing is

Do we also have a touch of the *B* version? Maybe

**Teleology**

This is a recent realization on my part: All the fuss about final causes comes to us because Aristotle lumped all goal-directed agents together. But some are not like the others.

According to Aristotle

From this arises all the argumentation about teleological language in science, and so on.

But was that a proper categorization on Aristotle’s part? Well

* “Goal-oriented” agents capable of planning and foresight; and
* Agents that behave as if goal-oriented

...amount to the same thing

More and more, on the surface, are teleological.

Under Aristotle's original definition of teleology, teleology gains a narrower and more precise definition. There is only a final cause if the agent is capable of choosing a goal and perceiving how to achieve it. So there is still a final cause when I reach for my cup of coffee, but no longer when the stone rolls down the hill.

It can be -- and is -- argued that this is semantic quibbling, it is possible to describe it in non-teleological terms. So the implications of teleology can already be avoided in biological sciences. Dividing teleology into teleology/teleonomy just gives us is the ability to use simpler, goal-oriented language without implying an *actual* teleology.

-----

I contend that all of the examples I've described share a common trait: They maintain their theistic argumentative power by placing unlike things within a single definition, and defended as valid, by the Kalam's supporters. For ""free will,"" the equivocation is subtler, resting on the finer points of our decision-making capabilities. For teleology, it's not necessarily an equivocation on Aristotle's part so much as an overly-broad definition he didn't realize was overly broad. (I'll forgive him for that; until I read up on teleonomy, it hadn't occurred to me that foresight was an important factor

So I've rambled enough. What say you all?

Or are you static in your belief that the bible was inspired by God and the supernatural things within it actually happened. That nothing will convince you otherwise. The same way that a developing society might believe that rain is caused by crying angels in the sky. You try and convince them by teaching them that it is water molecules that evaporate and then fall when too heavy in the sky. The angelists respond by reconciling science and angelism by saying that the angels just go down to lakes

I gotcha!”  What the kid is saying is that he knows the origin of his parents’ belief that it’s raining. He has not logically proved that it is not raining outside

Once you have shown that someone’s *reasons* for a particular belief are not actually *evidence* for that belief, depending on where you live.

1332325699.0,r6kh3,To Atheists: Does Empiricism require faith?,ANewMind,46,15,223,"Very often, I would like for you to explain to me how you can believe these things without faith.

Here is what I would say are the basic assumed beliefs of empiricism:

1. There is an objective
2. My senses
3. My mind is capable of accurately analyzing the data presented to it. 
4. My memory, and it is not common for extra memories to be inserted. 
5. Time moves in a linear fashion so that I am able to apply cause and effect. 
6. My current context is correct

Every one of these must be assumed without any evidence that doesn't require itself to be true. Further, it seems to me that they can only be accepted by faith alone.

None of these things must be accepted as true, including some mystics and occutists deny some or all of these claims, and (assuming the empirical worldview is true) they still deny them while being able to live happy and arguably productive lives. Various religious or spiritual beliefs may exist which start from fewer assumptions and still arrive at similar conclusions.

If you believe that your empirical worldview is true, for them they would be incorrect relative to yours. Examples include people who are dreaming and under the effects of hallucination, particularly those hallucinations caused by psychosis rather than just drugs.

This is not to suggest that people should be solipsists. I would imagine that very few if any people are solipsists. Most people do believe in something, and that may be discussed in a later thread. In this discussion, I would prefer to consider whether it is accepted by faith, rather than why you might suggest it is the right or best faith.

EDIT: it seems to me that a large number of comments make the argument that empiricism is justified because it is common to all people or that there is no other option. I can say with complete certainty that is not the case. I am a Christian. I did not arrive at any of these claims by assumption. However, and I write to people who I believe to be real. I do not believe in what I see in spite of my faith, but because of my faith in the Bible. If I ceased to believe in the Bible, I would cease to believe in reality of the world as we know it. That is because before I was saved, I was so deep in the occult and philosophy that I didn't even think that I was a real physical human. At that point, I did have trouble getting out of bed, and some days I did not. However, I accept this world

EDIT2: Well

1. By dictionary definition

2. Yes, not solipsism therefore empiricsim.

3. Everybody believes it

The short answer is that the idea of perfection is arbitrary and is a human concept that has no bearing on the world. One person's idea of perfection is not the same as another person's

Attributing real world properties (like existence or not existence) to a concept (like perfection) does not necessitate the truth of that concept. 

My favorite example:

    1. The perfect woman would have sex with only me (and ScarJo) whenever I wanted.
    2. The perfect woman would also be Kate Beckinsale.
    3. The perfect woman would also exist.
    4. Since I can conceive of no woman hotter or more perfect than Kate Beckinsale
          Kate Beckinsale will have sex with me (and ScarJo) whenever I want it. Giggity.

1322818243.0,mxdax,To All: Is there any argument for God based on only metaphysical assumptions?,tannat,36,4,241,"As a physicist visiting r/DebateReligion I've been surprised to see a trend of ignoring that many classical arguments for god were constructed on physical premises made out of ignorance of the time.  

Reoccurring examples are the Thomas Aquinas argument regarding an unmoved mover which contradicts the second law of thermodynamics and the Kalam cosmological argument which takes cause for granted in a situation where cause is in fact very hard to insert into the physical understanding.

All credit to the original constructors of these arguments but they  based the arguments on very rudimentary thinking about physics. ie. the Thomist argument tries to explain energy transfer without any knowledge of fundamental forms and mechanisms of energy and energy storage.

1.
We can of course debate the metaphysical implications anyway but:
Is it wrong to say that the first thing to do

If not

2.
Is there any interest in trying to revalidify or create new such arguments by embracing physics.

Why? Remember that the original arguments are built on assumptions of how our reality works. The trend to assign them to purely philosophical arguments is destructive for both theists and atheists: It makes the arguments irrelevant to reality as to compared to their originally intended impact and the honesty of using them becomes highly questionable.

Agree/disagree? Why?

3.
Is there any argument for God based on non physical assumptions out there? Devoid of the flaws above?


Acknowledged, but keep in mind that the border moving back to fulfill thee above mentioned arguments is not really an realistic option. If you want to argue this it would be decent to do this based on the current state of physics.

A common question that is raised is how much the actions of select groups of Muslims reflects the overall views of the religion and its adherents as a whole. Considering both sides are attempting to extrapolate to [the world's second largest religion with almost 1.6 billion believers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam)

* [**THE PEW FORUM ON RELIGION &amp; PUBLIC LIFE: The World’s Muslims: Religion

Linked above is the very recently published data from [Pew Research Center](http://www.pewresearch.org/),000 Muslims in countries in Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and Asia. This data is also combined and compared to an earlier data-set from a few years prior of Muslims in the United States, although this is a relatively small portion of the total report. The report itself is quite large; at about 140 pages I have only had a chance to skim it thus far. However, there is obviously a great deal to be gleaned from its pages, shall we?

* **Summary**

Based on what I've read so far, the large majority of Muslims are indeed what we would consider to be rather moderate individuals, at least where violence is concerned. Certainly such harsh generalities as ""most Muslims support killing non-Muslims"" can be thrown out the window before we even get on the highway. It is also apparent that views can range wildly from country to country on particular issues, and that overall Muslims are a rather heterogeneous group. *However* there are plenty of findings that trouble me as an atheist. While many of the more severe views are overall less common than an anti-theist like myself might expect, some views are even more popular than I would have guessed. Even more troubling, while some positions might hold a minority worldwide, certain countries and regions can end up largely in favor of some startling views. Finally, based on certain predictors.

For the sake of space, along with a brief explanation.

* **[Sharia law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharia_law)**

* % of Muslims who favor making sharia the official law of their respective country:

Top Three: Afghanistan (99%)

Bottom Three: Azerbaijan (8%)

Median by region: South Asia (84%), Sub-Saharan Africa (64%), Southern/Eastern Europe (18%), and Central Asia (12%).

Some things to note; countries in which Muslims make up large or overwhelming portions of the population tend to have much higher support for enshrining sharia. Countries that also have laws and a government that favor Islam over other religions and the nonreligious are also much more likely to have high support for sharia. Both of these facts suggests a cultural/political component to this position. However, gender, and even education. 

There are two important modifiers to this position; whether one believes sharia law should apply to everyone or just the Muslim population

* % of those Muslims that support sharia who believe it should only apply to Muslims:

Top Three: Kazakhstan (77%)

Bottom Three: Egypt (25%)

Median by region: Southern/Eastern Europe (64%), Southeast Asia (55%), and Middle East/North Africa (51%)

So while the majority of Muslims worldwide and in each region do not support applying sharia law to everyone, where 55% of *all Muslims* (or 74% of those who support sharia law) think it should apply to everyone.

* **Suicide Bombing**

Muslims as a whole are overwhelmingly against suicide bombing. Support is the minority in every country

* % of Muslims who believe attacks against civilians in defense of Islam can often/sometimes be justified

Top Three: Palestine (40%), and (due to this weeks relevance) Bangladesh (26%)

Bottom Three: Azerbaijan (1%)

* **Apostasy**

Muslims are pretty well-split when it comes to punishing leaving Islam with the sentence prescribed by the faith; death. Many countries in the Middle East/North Africa and South Asia are amazingly in support of this punishment

* % of those Muslims who support sharia who favor the death penalty for converts:

Top Three: Egypt (86%)

Bottom Three: Kazakhstan (4%)

* **Evolution &amp; Science**

Muslims are overall mostly of the belief that humans and other organisms have evolved over time (the survey does not clarify beyond that). 13 of 22 polled countries have a majority believing in theistic evolution versus the idea that we have always existed in present form. Notable exceptions include Iraq (only 27%) and Afghanistan (only 26%). Most Muslims also do not believe there is an inherent conflict between science and their religious belief

* **Moral Issues**

While Muslims tend to be more moderate overall in terms of issues of violence, and in most of those countries overwhelmingly so. The highest exception is Chad with 23% saying it is morally acceptable (it should be noted than some countries have significant percentages claiming it is not a moral issue, up to 34% in Albania). Muslims also overwhelmingly believe that all of the following are morally wrong; suicide, abortion, extramarital sex, homsexuality, and prostitution. Most Muslims also consider divorce immoral

* **Women**

Although most Muslims favor a woman's right to choose whether or not to wear a veil in public, the large majority are of the belief that wives must always obey their husbands, with most countries reporting percentages in the 80s or 90s in favor. Interestingly, while women tend to be more in favor of liberal positions than men, the differential never surpasses +22%, and averages closer to only +11%.

There are plenty more interesting statistics in this report

* Is violence in the Islamic world still a major issue of concern, honor killing, etc., or are the political and cultural factors more important?

* Is the role of women in the Islamic world a reasonable one in the 21st century? Can they rightly be considered an oppressed demographic

* Is the desire to enact sharia as law of the land a concern in many of these countries? Is it possible to do so in such a way that it only applies to Muslims? Are non-Muslims threatened in countries where significant percentages wish to apply sharia to everyone?

* How does one reconcile the belief that science and Islam are not in conflict with the wide acceptance of the Quran as the divinely inspired word of God? Is it concerning that more Muslims think no conflict exists than do accept evolution?",,t5_2snuc,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/1duio8/an_injection_of_data_into_the_discussion_of/

As the title of this post indicates,*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reductio_ad_absurdum) that the type of inductive reasoning on which Kalam rests can just as easily be used to prove that God does not exist.  Since the rationale in question [proves too much,](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proving_too_much) it must be discarded if we are to honestly maintain that we value and seek truth.

**The Argument**

* Everything that exists had a beginning.
* God did not have a beginning.
* Therefore

**Validity**

The argument follows basic [modus tollens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modus_tollens) form
 
**Soundness

Premise two follows naturally for all definitions of God that render him the causal agent responsible for the universe.  *""Since God created time, and that the intended audience of this post already accepts Kalam, there should be little to no dispute over premise two.

**Interlude &amp; Crescendo**

Syllogistic logic is an extremely powerful tool.  If the argument is structurally valid and the premises are factually sound, and are only one step away from fulfilling the latter.  So, where could things go from here?  Possibly, you will accept the first premise, completing the argument and leading you to some form of strong atheism.  More probably, you will reject the first premise while maintaining that the analogous premise in Kalam is still sound, and in so doing betray an uncomfortable tension that raises certain unpleasant questions about your intellectual honesty.  Ideally, essentially

 **Soundness

Premise one is confirmed by universally consistent observations of existent things; in other words, and would likely necessitate a further conversation to explore the possibility that God is simply the beneficiary of [special pleading]( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_pleading).  Perhaps we can agree that premise one seems more likely than its negation; after all, it simply isn’t the case that we observe various permanent or eternal objects in the world around us.  In sum, I doubt that anyone can sincerely deny the truth of premise one.

Using ancient Roman mythology and the Abrahamic religions as examples.  The people of ancient Rome truly took Jupiter's desires into consideration and believed that Apollo rode his chariot across the sky.


A Muslim, would likely dismiss such beliefs as naive or ridiculous because we now know, thanks to modern science, that this just isn't the case.


Yet, the belief is still widely held on to in western culture (about 40% of people in the United States).


In fact, arguments from ignorance, or logically invalid arguments cryptically put together by apologists with the gall to call themselves philosophers. 
 

Is there anyone here that can show me that there is more of a difference between mythology and religion than just the number of people today that believe it's all true?  Are there any arguments that can be used in the case for religion that can't be used to argue that any of the ancient Greek, or Norse gods existed?

1. Any post making a positive claim for God's existence or describing any properties of God (omniscience, etc) must include in the post references to peer reviewed scientific journals that prove either the veracity or very least plausibility of the claim. Citing unscientific theistic pseudo-journals run by organizations like the Discovery Institute or Answers in Genesis is grounds for immediate and permanent banning. Failure to cite your sources will result in a temporary ban to last no more than four weeks for first time offenders. Second time offenders will be permabanned. 

2. If you cite the bible as a scientific source

3. Mentioning Thomas Aquinas or promoting any of his arguments is grounds for immediate banning for all time. 

4. If your argument has previously been refuted and no new evidence has been put forward to make the argument  something to reconsider

5. Posts arguing for any supernatural phenomena without relevant citations from credible scientific journals will result in a first time offense probationary ban lasting no longer than two weeks. A second offense will result in a permaban. 

6. Posts supporting any form of Young Earth Creationism (without reference to God) must first be vetted in r/AskScience. If the argument passes in r/AskScience, you will be immediately banned for all time. 

7. Any post relying on past events to make a claim that doesn't rely on archaeological evidence must be supported with proper citations to non self-published scholarly history books. Self-published is in reference to the author

8. Any claims made of the distant past concerning some facet of human civilization must include valid archaeological citations from reputable archaeological journals not connected to theistic organizations like DI or AIG. Citing a theistic pseudo journal will result in a permaban. Failure to cite a source will result in a one week probationary ban for first time offenders and a permaban for any second offense.

1372519971.0,1hbas7,The inadequacies of the bible,Cituke,44,13,192,"Apologies for making a new submission rather than commenting, and so on.

I wanted to give a more thorough account of why this attitude is incorrect.  

The first thing is that on some subjects it's directly contradicted by the text.  [Luke](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+1&amp;version=NIV) begins with Luke claiming to be writing a very accurate historical account.  [2 Timothy](http://biblehub.com/2_timothy/3-16.htm) claims the bible is useful for attempts at being righteous.

Moreover

- What is intended by the authors

- What is expected by adherents of the religion

- What the bible would be expected to look like if there were a divine finger behind it

The first two aren't particularly relevant to the argument that the bible is inadequate.  If the authors intended to write anything less than that which we should expect of the God of classical monotheism

**What should we expect from the bible?**

A number of things come to mind, and maybe something like a discussion of the social contract.

I'd throw in whatever theistic arguments might be successful if theism is true (somehow the Kalam didn't make it in?).  I'd bring up how many chromosomes humans have because that would be radical confirmation of unknown knowledge that would help confirm the divine inspiration of the book.

It's nothing I wouldn't do and I don't even have perfect knowledge.  That's the kind of stuff that would be put in there if God wanted what was good for us, and wanted to verify for us that the bible is true.  Regardless of the intent of the authorship and regardless of what adherent expect, this is what *should* be in the bible given our background understanding of what God or even just a decent person with a fair amount of knowledge would do.  It wouldn't have to be a complete library of biology, but just enough as would be necessary to confirm the bible or otherwise provide significant help to people.

Even if God couldn't bother to get any of my examples in there, something more helpful, and something more confirming of theism/that the book is divinely inspired.

**What we actually get**

Apparently there wasn't enough room for this because we needed 4 books telling the same story about Christ, [some guy tripping out](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ezekiel+1&amp;version=ESV), an account of creation that would confuse the shit out of people who are apparently reading it wrong, including our dutiful historian Luke who seems to think [Genesis was an actual history](http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Luke+3%3A23-38&amp;version=ESV).  Most of this stuff is useless, boring, and confusing stuff and I've only mentioned a few parts of it.  If you think the bible should be that, then I don't think you have a healthy expectation of what God would produce for His primary communication to us.

**And of course this is an entirely one way street** 

If there were things like the chromosome count, it would be put on parade and taught to us from our first day in school (a bit hyperbolic, but you get the idea).  No one would discount this information if it was in there because ""the bible is not a science textbook""

1364254885.0,1b09o8,Secular arguments against homosexuality,Cituke,45,11,100,"So I've often heard that there simply are no nonreligious arguments against homosexuality.  I may be reading such statements wrong

The two contentions are these:

- Secular arguments against homosexuality can exist in principle.  That is

- The people who argue against homosexuality do (if very infrequently) appeal to secular reasoning

Forgive me

I've been reading Scott Rae's *Moral Choices* and Scott in fact does bring up some secular objection to homosexuality.  I'll paraphrase:

**HIV (utilitarianism)** - HIV has much higher rates of transmission amongst homosexuals.  I couldn't see any citations for this (it was on audio and he doesn't explicate on anything) so I did my own research.  According to the CDC

But I still don't think this works as an argument

But is there a point at which dangers that could be associated with homosexuality could outweigh the liberty of the homosexual?  We can go off the deep end here and hypothesize homosexuality entailing an 80% chance of getting HIV.  Does society have an obligation to keep people from harming themselves in this case?

**First Formulation of the Categorical Imperative (Deontology)** - """"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law without contradiction.""  Kant generally meant this in two ways

Here Rae argues that if homosexuality were taken to be universal

 I think this specific categorical imperative is at best a consideration in morality, then certainly society would fail, but that does not render it immoral to be an artist.  Exceptions to a rule are fine in many cases.

**""No civilization has ever survived the destruction of the traditional family."" (historical)** - You'll notice I went out of my way to quote this one directly.  For the life of me

Here is why I think it is absurd:

A) Homosexuality is not out to destroy traditional families

B) I don't know of any evidence suggesting this assertion apart from the communal rearing of children attempted in modern Israel. (which did fail)

C) This commits what I would call the ""Fallacy of inevitability"" you can always say that a society which in the past didn't allow the traditional family failed and you can say that any society which doesn't have traditional families will eventually fail

While I think I can amply defend my two contentions

To be honest

&gt;“Yes, a whole city, even an entire Volk.”

I don't think that's at all an unfair comparison either.  Apart from the first argument (which seems to take an extreme on not allowing people to make their own risk decisions), I don't just have a factual problem with the people who think these arguments are sound, I have a moral problem with the people that make these arguments.

Next, it has wavelike characteristics and particlelike characteristics. How can you possibly say that quantum physics is the ""default position"" and when people claim god said ""let there be light"" they are over-complicating things?

1355374711.0,14rpxx,To Christians: Three issues I have with Christianity,Ghost_Of_JamesMuliz,38,11,139,"See if you can help shed some light on these

1) A God of mercy is not compatible with a God of justice.

At least, they are saved. If you do not believe in Jesus Christ as your lord and savior, you are not saved. That is not true mercy. It’s conditional mercy.

2) Christianity underestimates God as part of its very premise.

The reason why Jesus had to die was as an expression of God’s pain in forgiving us (this is a summary of something Keller said in The Reason For God, then that means that thing is damaging God. Claiming that God can be hurt is the height of foolishness. God, the Omniscient, Omnipotent Creator the Universe, the one who made all the Rules in the first place, has been hurt by the rejection of a puny ape? Christianity, in its attempt to make God seem relateable

3) You cannot have a relationship with someone that is infinitely greater than you.

A healthy relationship is one where both partners give and receive from each other, typically expect the husband to respect the wife’s wishes (or so I have observed thus far). We see that unhealthy, abusive relationships are those where one holds power over the other- when the relationship crosses the line from marriage to servitude. So what about a relationship where one member not only *believes* himself to be greater than the other, but truly, objectively *is* greater than the other? Not just greater, but infinitely greater? In this case, you do not have a relationship. You see, and demands your entire essence. He is omniscient, and even everything you will be. He knows more about you than you know about yourself. What do you know about God? You know some basic facts- he’s all-powerful, and wants you. Is this healthy? If all you know about your boyfriend is some vague idea that he’s nice and he loves you

The answer is simple. The ones that promised the greatest rewards for believing (ie eternal life/happiness) and the worst punishments for not believing (burn in hell forever, etc.) and religions that offered easily understandable answers to life's hard questions too (god created earth, you go to heaven when you die, lying is bad because god said so.) Much like companies compete by discrediting each other, religions also gain competitive advantage by claiming that all other religions are false.

All the things you'd expect to find in a religion that would out compete others in a market place you find in today's dominant religions. What should be obvious, homosexuals should be stoned). As this way of thinking becomes more and more obviously wrong, religion has been unable to adapt.  Much like companies that cant adapt to a changing market place go out of business or animals that cant adapt go extinct, religions influence is increasingly decreasing. It continues to evolve however, Christianity for instance has been backtracking on its claims of being scientifically and morally accurate by basically dismissing the whole old testament.

http://willcady.com/2012/08/23/a-heartfelt-plea-from-the-dalai-lama/

I was wondering how our atheists and materialists feel about his view. Especially his statements on reductionism (which personally sum up a lot of my issues with some strains of atheism):

&gt;In the current paradigm of science, and experimental verification can be considered valid.  This method involves the use of quantification and measurement, repeatability, and confirmation by others.  Many aspects of reality as well as some key elements of human existence, such as the ability to distinguish between good and evil, spirituality, artistic creativity – some of the things we most value about human beings – inevitably fall outside the scope of the method.  Scientific knowledge, is essential.  Only by such recognition can we genuinely appreciate the need to integrate science within the totality of human knowledge.  Otherwise our conception of the world, materialistic

&gt;My difficulty is not with reductionism as such.  Indeed, is turned into a metaphysical standpoint.  Understandably this reflects a common tendency to conflate the means with the end, especially when a specific method is highly effective.

1337024688.0,tmx4a,"The most popular falsifiable deities have already been falsified.  However, if your holy books are simply metaphor, they are unfalsifiable.",MisterFlibble,38,88, Bible

I also acknowledge that this means I carry the burden of proof

Keep in mind, they are admitting that their text does not literally define their deity.  Simply put, if the passage in the bible is metaphor, then it doesn't define God.

We'll go with the holy text I'm most familiar with for most of my argument because, all of the religious texts I've read, to the extent that I've read them thus far, seem to also be subject to the same arguments.

If one is a Christian

Here is my argument:

* According to Christians
* God is defined in the bible.  Some of this definition is by his visual appearance
* Anything in the bible that a follower considers *metaphor* does not qualify as a literal definition of God.
* All evidence related to the alleged actions of God
* The Christian deity is *falsified*.


Elaborations:

&gt;According to Christians

Simply put, they are to conform to the bible and correct their view.

The bible, every understood letter of the word should be obeyed.  This even goes for situations of the same moral severity as killing your own children.  If God demands it, you must do it.  Any exceptions (which, technically, there shouldn't be, even according to the bible) are addressed in my third point.

In my experience

&gt;God is defined in the bible.  Some of this definition is by his visual appearance

The visual descriptions of God vary, personality, and actions.  God is said to look like everything from light, to similar to humans (we're made in his own image), to not even being able to look at his radiance at all regardless.

The visual descriptions, however, are his actions.

Story after story, destroys cities.  He starts by creating the entire universe in a matter of days.  He ends up flooding the entire planet.  In the New testament, he even grants humanity the ability to move mountains with the power of prayer... unless it's all metaphor, which brings me to the next point in the argument.

&gt; Anything in the bible that a follower considers *metaphor* does not qualify as a literal definition of God.

I would guess that a majority of Christians in the world, actually* happen and that such stories are there to merely provide guidance or teach a lesson, or to give a cryptic answer to a believer struggling to find one.

If this is the case

If all you have to go on, personal feelings, and/or faith in these feeling, then why would you even have these beliefs in the first place?  If your God is not literally defined in any text at all, then clearly it's only being defined by you... Or maybe family or friends.  Regardless, this renders the deity as unfalsifiable, and therefore giving no rational, or scientific reason to assume it exists.


&gt;All evidence related to the alleged actions of God

The two most prominent actions

Using simple math and counting the generations and life spans of characters going back to the first man and woman in the mythology,000 years old.  The easiest way to falsify this is by looking up at a clear sky at night.  Our galaxy is 100,000 light years across, meaning that the farthest stars we see herein we are actually seeing as they were up to 100,000 years ago.  It's safe to say that the stars in galaxies that are millions or billions of light years away drive the point home and make any further argument redundant.

However, but even rely on the great age of the planet to find answers today.  The same evidences contradict any kind of global flood.

Even the claims of old-earth creationists are falsified by the evidence which shows that birds did not precede land animals and plants certainly did not precede the existence of our sun. 

There's never been any evidence of a body of water consisting entirely of blood either.

No mountain has ever been moved by use of prayer, is said to be a simple matter provided the one praying as a small amount of faith (like that of a mustard seed).  At best, we've carved giant valleys and tunnels through a number of them with explosives. 

Such a prayer would have been extremely handy in building the Pennsylvania Turnpike

&gt; The Christian deity is *falsified*.

In conclusion, not even a deity, did the things it says he did.

What we don't know, to easily say that if your holy text describes your deity as leaving evidence behind, and it's the only way to define your deity, and the existing evidence contradicts that deities actions, it does not exist.


**TL/DR**: Just read the 5 premises in bullet point above.

**EDIT**: Changed ""actions"" in the second premise to ""interactions with the physical

**UPDATE**:  It seems some may not be grasping the argument, actually.  Any part that I can't use to prove or disprove your deity, I'm not considering because it provides no useful way to test the claim.

Arguments often tend to go basically that we cannot arrive at empiricism without an assumption that is unevidenced by itself and that such an assumption is either unjustified or else opens the door to other axiomatic assumptions

So

One attempt is the common sense view. I want to get things done

I'm not fond of this approach. I think once you enter the thoughtful, because common sense easily amounts to majority rule. If you are going to debate philosophy, you ought to be able to defend your points on that level.

I think there are a number of excellent escapes from solipsism without abandoning logic. Empiricists

Here is one simple escape.

Sense data exists. Whether it is in actuality the parts of a dream, I feel the itch on my arm, I taste the tea in my mouth.

We can argue about what I and these sensations and I ""really"" are

Now for me

From my perspective, and all investigative thought are an attempt to understand that world.

You may say ""But what if that world isn't real? Then you're understanding nothing!"" Well, but not non-existent. I could also easily map out the world and physics of Super Mario Brothers. It wouldn't be non existent either, merely fictional. So this world I'm mapping, that I see as the real world, exists, just as the world of Super Mario Brothers exists, even if it is ultimately not ""real"".

In my experience, try to get laid in, and pay my bills in. Truths about this world are true for this world. If another world reveals itself of which my world is a subset, then I'll investigate that meta world, but I can't investigate it until I see some sign of it's existence.

I'm a little disappointed that the responses in this thread are all so far responses to solipsism and not to my argument.

**Who created [insert existential precedent here]?** I'm aware of the ""Who created God?"" argument. [I will offer you John Lennox's solution.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFD6U8XYhRI) Please note that the other two fare no better in this regard. (""Which reality gave rise to the quantum nothing?"" And if you want to argue that philosophically

**God of the Gaps** - All three constructs are extrapolations. I could just as easily say ""multiverse of the gaps."" The gaps that you choose to fill with a multiverse or quantum reality

***
## Basic Argument
***

P1: Everything that begins to exist has a cause

P2: The universe has a beginning of its existence

C1: The universe has a cause of its existence.

***
## The Various Problems
***

**Causality**


 Let me start by making one important statement: *There is no such thing as the Law of Causality*. Causality is **nothing** more than the probabilistic results of quantum mechanics. And at the base of QM are non-deterministic events

With this in mind, and [other events](http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/determinism-causal/#QuaMec). 

Strictly speaking, energy is conserved (seeing Schoedinger's equation if you want proof), and therefore objects cannot appear without cause or prior state if they violate conservation of energy. The only problem with this is that we live in an [observably](http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html) [flat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shape_of_the_Universe#Flat_universe) [universe](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqb1lSdqRZY) - which has a net energy content of zero.

With this in mind

As I was stating above, the universe, around the moment of genesis, was *not* a macroscopic object, but an object clearly in the domain of Quantum Mechanics. [Ref](http://www.space.com/52-the-expanding-universe-from-the-big-bang-to-today.html). With that in mind, I would question whether or not P2 follows off the modified P1.

......................................................

**Equivocation**

This is the most common rebuttal

If something exists for all time, in time or space, in which the universe did not exist. So did the universe ""begin""? Did it go from a state of not existing, to a state of existing? No. Because there is *no* state in which the universe has not existed.

This is what irks me when people say ""So the universe came from nothing

This post will begin to exist when I hit ""submit""

The common response to this is (the realisation that temporal causality cannot apply the universe) is to assert atemporal causality... something which has never been observed. And for atemporal causality, it would mean that these two states would have to exist at the same time (as time cannot elapse between them after all). Thus atemporal causality posits that at one point in time the universe both existed and did not exist... which is a contradiction.

**Composition**

For those that ignored my comments on determinism and believe that there is in fact some scientific law of causality, we inductively apply causality to macroscopic interactions because that is consistent for us. But applying this notion to the universe as a whole (which includes macroscopic interactions, quantum interactions, and the dimensions of space and time) makes it a fallacy of composition.

********
## Conclusion
*********

1. At the bottom level, quantum universe.
2. It has been shown that causality (as we know it - being temporal causality) cannot apply to the universe
3. Not only is atemporal causality completely unsubstantiated
4. Even if everything in the universe was fully determined

This train of thought has vast consequences for the omniscience and omnibenevolence of God. An omniscient God would have known not to make the tree available

2) ""From Adam to Noah"" This part's pretty self explanatory, and before modern medicine it was down around 35-45. So how is this explained? Because they were God's first creations, they lived longer? After Adam, the life spans do not decrease as the lineage increases its distance from him (from Adam to Noah). So when and why did the life span drop so suddenly? 

Especially considering that according to creation, 1056 years passed. So roughly 1/6 of the Earth's history had passed and there was no significant drop in life span. They all lived to be at least 350 (lowest - 365, most - 969). People rarely live to be 100, even today. So again, what accounts for their (Adam and his immediate descendants) incredibly long lives, and for the enormous drop in average life span from them to us?

My neighbor's a Christian, ""Believe what is in the Bible or you will not *believe* what is in the Bible.""

If this is the case, it falls apart and is reduced to, ""God made it that way"". Well, he made his creations inherently curious, so requiring belief before understanding is an incredibly ill-advised idea.

1320780430.0,m54g6,To theists: How to overcome the problem of evil (and three arguments that will never work on atheists),GoodDamon,35,3,231,"I've been thinking about the problem of evil again

The purpose of this post isn’t to call out theists as ""wrong

As a refresher, omniscient, and omnibenevolent (hereafter referred to as 3-O) deity is incompatible with the presence of evil and suffering in the world. If he wants to prevent evil but cannot, he is not all-powerful. If he could, but doesn’t want to, then he is malevolent. If he wants to prevent it and has the power to do so, then evil and suffering should not exist. And if he neither wants to prevent it nor has the power to do so

**Atheist perspective on the problem**

The reason atheists -- or at least

Let us assume

* **...and is omniscient and omnipotent

In this scenario, and is therefore not omnibenevolent. Why he lacks the desire is academic; perhaps he has what he regards as valid reasons not to interfere, but from the human perspective, he can't be omnibenevolent, or the word ceases to have meaning.

* **...and is omniscient and omnibenevolent

In this scenario, and is therefore not omnipotent.

* **...and is omnipotent and omnibenevolent

In this scenario, and is therefore not omniscient.

Logically, since he could just give himself that power). The third is always going to be logically inconsistent with the other two, unless you change the definition of one of the words. And as I will explain below, atheists typically reject that change.

**Theist responses that don’t hold water with us**

Terrible, agonizingly, and uncomprehendingly starving to death, or a boy getting pressed into the Sierra Leone Revolutionary United Front after being forced by them to murder his own parents, atheists usually get one of three responses from theists, none of which we find compelling against the problem of evil in the least:

* **Apologetic 1: The theist says that this is human-caused misery (the ""free will"" apologetic).**

I'm not sure why theists think this is a good argument. Why would an omnibenevolent God care what caused the misery? The existence of children who suffer through no fault of their own is enough to destroy this argument. God has no reason not to intervene if there's a kid starving or dying of some horrid disease or injury unless he is not omnibenevolent by any human definition of the word.

On top of that, as he’s supposed to be omnipotent. Any human being who had the power to stop all suffering and didn’t use it would be reviled as a monster complicit in the unnecessary, agonizing deaths of millions.

* **Apologetic 2: The theist says that evil is the absence of God.**

This one is interesting, by definition, has power over and is aware of everything, everywhere, all the time. There cannot be a place or person from which he is absent. He is, in fact, omnipresent.

* **Apologetic 3: The theist changes the definition of omnibenevolent to include some sort of greater -- but unknowable -- goal accomplished by human misery.**

This last one I’d like to unpack a little

Atheists do not, we reject definitions of ""good"" that include ""whatever God does, no matter how inscrutable and mysterious."" To us, if it's not good by a human definition, it's *not good*. It's *something else*, and should have its own word or words to describe it, with a comprehensible definition.

Frankly, it isn't omnibenevolence by any human definition, and human definitions are the only ones that matter for human comprehension. So it’s *not omnibenevolence*, it’s *something else*.

To give them their due

But that’s really a tangent from my main point that if theists wish to convince atheists and convert *us*

Atheists have an easy, you need to give us an answer that is just as simple and just as logical.

---

**TL;DR**: In order to counter the problem of evil with an atheist, or ""we can't understand"" (rendering the words used to describe God, such as ""omnibenevolent,"" utterly meaningless). These arguments will generally fail with atheists.

1315645740.0,kb01k,To Atheists: What are some atheist arguments that you see as bad arguments?,,32,1,95,"This is a bit of a fun post

1. The argument that religion was responsible for the fall of Rome and then religion kept the whole world back. This is primarily used against Christians, or at least be better off. Determinism. Thirdly, this argument ignores that there were some progresses made in the medieval era, but looking for world-changing scientific breakthroughs is the wrong way to go about examining history. It would be like expecting the next Steve Jobs to come out of Kosovo. Things were chaotic and uncertain and most people focused just on survival. Finally, this argument assumes an inherently western ethnocentric view of history. As if Rome is all that there was and no other society made any scientific progress or *could* make progress. Like China with inventing gunpowder... Or the Arabian Islamic world and algebra. 

2. Another argument I've seen that annoys me goes along the lines of ""this deity has similarities to your deity, there are just as many (if not more) differences that tend to be ignored. Examples: Jesus and Horus having virgin births. Except Horus was born with the aid of a golden dildo. Muhammad and Joseph Smith, except Joseph Smith found and translated golden plates while Muhammad wrote what an angel told him. And even if there are similarities, how does that prove a religious belief to be wrong? Considering the history and scope of humanity and religion, aren't there bound to be similarities and overlaps somewhere?

**If B)**

One more uncommon bit to note is that these options are not extensively mutually exclusive and some moral issue might fall into either category.  For instance

So the retort which I hear almost invariably from apologists is that because God is necessarily good

This manages only to push the question into a further layer of complexity when we ask what it is about God that makes Him good.  If God's necessary goodness is derived from His own approval of Himself

1366295379.0,1clv6q,To Christians: Blood sacrifice or damnation. The original false dichotomy.,Basilides,39,13,103,"Some evangelical Christians believe that God demands a blood sacrifice to atone for sins. This presupposition is really the basis of their soteriology.

But what if it's not true? What if ancient Jews saw animal sacrifice as just one of several forms/expressions of worship and not as *the* non-negotiable basis of their forgiveness?

There are examples in the OT of God forgiving without blood sacrifice.

'If, he is to bring as an offering for his sin a tenth of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering.' (Leviticus 5:11-13)

When God saw what they did and how they turned from their evil ways
(Jonah 3:10)

God was also known to accept incense and jewelry as atonement offerings.

So Aaron did as Moses said

So we have brought as an offering to the Lord the gold articles each of us acquired—armlets, earrings and necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the Lord. (Numbers 31:50)

We have all heard that animal sacrifices ceased several decades after the crucifixion of Jesus with the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. But

By the time the Second Temple was built, did not rely upon animal sacrifices as a facet of their religion even after the construction of the Second Temple. 

So, animal sacrifices ceased in 587 BCE. 

Thus

And

Perhaps it's because the Old Testament says there were available to the Jews other means of obtaining forgiveness.

It seems to me the majority of answers boiled down to something like this:

* Religion as an explanatory framework for physical phenomenon has been superseded by science.

Obviously this is a very narrow definition of religion that leaves out many of the aspects that draw people to religion in the first place. One of the most important of these is that religion provides a definition or model of a good life.

I'm curious whether atheism can provide any such definition

1) Is it possible to say that one way of living is better than another? 

2) If so

3) In what way is this model superior to one provided by religion?

For this post I'm going to make the unjustified assumption that the Wager has no downside from choosing wrong -- you don't end up worse by displeasing the one god that does exist. You either guess right and win

The wager as I understand it starts from a position of ignorance. I don't know if there is a god or not

The choices are near infinite. There are many religions, many of them now dead. The wager offers no help for narrowing the choice down. If I knew who the true god is, I wouldn't be making a wager, after all. So I might as well pick up something at random. No matter what I do, it's overwhelmingly likely that I'm going to choose the wrong one.

- Is the law not fixed?  If the rules on morality can be phased in and out like this

- Things are good because God says they are good (in which case morality is arbitrary or at least a product of God's whimsy)

- God says things are good because they are good (in which case we have a separate standard of morality that we are appealing to)

Letters were a popular composition both within novels and as collections of fictional or didactic correspondence.  They were a popular form of entertainment and instruction, not novels or anything like that"" doesn't actually help us determine that they are genuine.

There's also an interesting discussion of how writers were trained to compose letters. Chapter 8 discusses the genre at the time of the Roman imperial period of pseudonymous letters and letter collections written in the name of fictional, or Euripides.

&gt;. . . the letters will give the impression of having been really written by that person by imitating the dialect and reflecting historical setting

Does not Philippians speak of a truly enlightened person as adopting a ""view from above""

&gt;By the Roman imperial period

So whoever wrote the NT letters, historical plausibility, the use of well known names, places and precise dates, all to make the final product “ring true”.  They were trained to add minor personal details, such as requests for a cloak or mentions of the author's health, to increase the appearance of authenticity.

For example, but which the *actual* audience (the author's contemporaries, and us) find very intriguing, requiring us to fill in the details.  How many times have we heard ""Well, Paul didn't *need* to talk about Jesus' life, because everybody he was writing to already knew about it""?  The last letter in this collection, one in which the narrative author writes that he is plotting an assassination

Then there’s the collection itself and how it’s put together. Rosenmeyer argues that Chion’s letter collection is: 

&gt;deliberately arranged in chronological *dis*order. The arrangement may reflect an attempt at historical verisimilitude: the disorder is meant to suggest the absence of editorial intervention, retrieved from their respective addresses, were bound together as they came in, without regard for date or subject matter. In other words, this is like a jumble of ‘real’ letters in Pharlaris’ attic, not a sophisticated literary anthology.

One is reminded of the vast amount of scholarly work that has been done to try to figure out the original order of the Pauline letters

Rosenmeyer concludes that the only way we can tell whether a letter is genuine or a pseudonymous literary construction is from external evidence.  Internal literary clues are no help, if any, of the Pauline Epistles were actually written by Paul of Tarsus?

* Your religion can be predicted with fairly good accuracy from your geographic region.

Then

* To me
* Theists avoid trying to answer questions like ""what does the weight of evidence indicate?"" and ""what do I have good reason to think is true?"" No one looks about and says
* Theists who express the position that atheism is ""depressing"" seem to me to be very afraid of death

All of this leads me to suspect -- again, and it is one of the underlying assumptions they make on the same level as ""I exist"" and ""my senses are at least sometimes accurate.""

Those last two are assumptions we all must make to avoid solipsism. We make many other assumptions day to day, those assumptions are at least partially informed by deductive reasoning and experience. If you treat assumption as a spectrum, with 0 being ""not at all an assumption"" to 100 being ""nothing but an assumption,"" almost everything we do or think during the day would fall somewhere between. Even such seemingly obvious conclusions as ""if I stand up, I will be upright and vertical"" have a component of assumption within them; we assume them to be true because of past experiences, inductive reasoning that is metaphysically indefensible, but absolutely indispensable.

How do I actually know that standing up will result in me being upright and vertical? Well, that going through the motions of standing up will always result in me... well... standing up? Nope. But I can treat it as close enough to 100% to make it reasonable to behave as if I know.

So let's take it as a given that we all reach conclusions that contain a component of assumption

The difference between these sorts of assumptions and the ones that are *nothing but* assumptions is what I'd like to focus on

My contention is that theistic belief ultimately belongs in that category of assumption. It cannot be compared to the assumptive components of any conclusions we reach that are somewhere on the spectrum between 0 -- ""not at all an assumption"" -- and 100 -- ""nothing but an assumption"" -- because anything on the spectrum also contains at least a little bit of non-assumption. Its assumptive value is 100 -- just like ""I exist"" and ""my senses are at least sometimes accurate.""

1344957726.0,y7f4i,To Christians (that believe in the trinity):  Why is the true nature of God completely absent in Jewish scripture.  ,Adtwerk,32,4,96,"Over in this thread

http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/y6uoc/to_christians_abraham_achieved_salvation_prior_to/

it was discussed how Abraham was saved long before Christ ever atoned for sin.  This salvation was afforded to him as a result of his faith in God.  It seemed to be the general consensus among Christians (in that thread) that because Jesus is God and because God is timeless the atonement extends both directions and faith in God is the same as faith in Christ. 

Alright

If my premise is true why is the true nature of God competely absent Jewish scripture?  It would seem God had no desire to explain to Abraham, etc... who he really was.  Why did God not explain in detail to the prophets of old the doctrine of salvation?  If salvation through faith in Christ was readily availible to the Jews and all nations (thats part of the premise, see link above) it would make sense to me that God explained this to them. 

Now if we look at the Christian sect Mormonism this is actually what they teach.  They teach that Adam was given the gospel of Jesus via some angelic visitations and that animal sacrafice was meant to be a symbol of Christ's sacrafice that was scheduled to happen at a future date.  According to Mormon doctrine Noah

Now the Mormon answer to my concern is to rewrite history (they add to the Old Testament a 'Book of Abraham' and they make 1000s of alterations to the Old Testament, new chapters).   Question for the rest of Christianity.  Why didn't God do what Mormon doctrine claims he did (ignoring other details of Mormon theology of course)?  Why wasn't the Gospel of Christ ubiquitous through out Jewish scripture?  Not only is it not common, its nonexistent.  The Jews have thousands of verses to help them understand God, his nature, and his relationship with man.  The most important part of God's nature is missing.  The Jews also have loads of verses to explain to them the role of the messiah and his importance in God's plan... again we have nothing about the Atonement of Christ or the doctrine of the Trinity.  

I would like to hear the Christian perspective on this.  Now if your issue is that God could not forgive sin until after the atonement please seen the link up top,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,,t3_y7f4i

And it's absolutely nerve-racking (I get kinda built up about these things)

**Background of the argument**:

1.  The physical constants exist in exact amounts and proportions so as to support the development of intelligent minds (the example I always use is that if you alter the expansion rate of the universe by 1X10^-40

2. This is either due to chance

3.  It's not due to chance or natural necessity

4.  Therefore it's due to design

There end up being a lot of parameters used like the proton neutron mass ratios

**End of background**

**My objection to the argument**

My rebuttal comes in the form of very very simple statistics.  You can't make a probability call with a sample size of one.  As such we have no idea what the probabilities of the constants should be.  A high probability renders precision a moot idea.  Moreover

A) Look at all conceivable outcomes and if the item in question represents a small portion of conceivable outcomes

B) Look at how much any given process errs in any direction from the average.  If the item in question arrives at or reasonably near the desired outcome despite a high margin of error and an external input altered the outcome

Just by comparison of the two categories

I've run into a couple Bayesian statisticians nudging at it

To be honest I'm not sure how people are coming up with anything resembling a meaningful number for some categories.  For instance

**Other objections to the argument**

1) The vast majority of time and space has been inhospitable to intelligent life.  Well I don't consider this a good rebuttal because the argument is about any life at all

2) Life could exist in other forms.  It's not inconceivable to not have carbon based life, plenty of the parameters have to do with the existence of the whole of the universe or long lasting stars or instances where we would have much except hydrogen.

But that's a problem with strategy, yes, but in doing so does not establish claims of truth. The fundamentalist who claims that every idea in the bible (historical, scientific, spiritual, etc.) is correct and the more ""liberal"" believer who only claims that the bible is authoritative in spiritual matters still face the problem of justifying *how* we know that the bible is right about these things.

Surely we can imagine writings on spiritual topics that are wrong (in fact we don't need to, can you explain to me how we know that the bible is right about what you think it's right about?

1375526012.0,1jmd1u,[META] Saving this Sub,code_primate,79,53,237,"This sub is a circlejerk. I say this as a person who is generally quite critical of both traditional theistic and anti-theistic arguments. There is an abundance of evidence to prove that it is a circlejerk

There are a few critical problems

**Problem 1: Questions in titles**

This is extremely prevalent and problematic. The specifics of this problem were astutely described [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/DebateReligion/comments/171i10/meta_to_all_if_you_want_to_debate_state_your/), subtextual digs at the opposing side. Presenting debates like this generally leads to a hostile tone in the discussion. Additionally, it will be much more confusing for people new to the sub who haven't learned our strange system of subtext. For example, I can give you links to about 15 /r/DebateReligion posts that ask the question ""Is there free will in heaven?"" to Christians. Now, for those of us familiar with the old song and dance, we know that the subtext is that a widely-accepted solution to the Logical Problem of Evil is the Free Will Defense, which relies on the possibility of Transworld Depravity, in effect forcing there to be several comments before the debate begins over the OP's actual subtextual assertion? It would be infinitely better to say: ""To Theists: The Christian conception of heaven seems to conflict with a key tenet of the Free Will Defense."" No one feels patronized or like the OP is trying to disguise a dig at religion. Instead

**Problem 2: Engagement with philosophy**

A lot of atheist and anti-theistic people here have a strong distaste/distrust of any non-logical positivist philosophy. This is strange, undeniably, debating the philosophy of religion. And while the worst offenders are a big problem, I think the vast majority of people here could benefit from a bit more reading. I think someone trained in philosophy in an academic capacity should assemble separate introductory and advanced surveys of the history of philosophy, with a slight emphasis on philosophy of religion, and these should be ""required reading."" Let's be honest here, people learn a lot from debating ideas themselves, it is a lot more likely that you're going to wallow around in really fucking stupid ideas than independently intuit a previously undiscovered universal truth. The wallowing bit happens a lot here and, and having weekly threads to debate them over and over again is really stupid, Hegel

**Problem 3: Repetition**

Recently, but the results were absolutely staggering. I'm still compiling them, but I'm fairly sure 90% of posts on the sub can be distilled to the same 30 questions (I'm working on listing those questions). I don't even want to discuss the circlejerking in those posts, which is potentially viewed as a controversial accusation by some. But saying we get several posts a week about xyz topic is, empirically, not an exaggeration. Overall, we have a very weird and ultimately harmful lifecycle of posts. Most subs our size have a few big posts a day with ~200 upvotes and a lot of comments. We have about 10 (at least) posts per day. These usually receive about 5 and up to about 30 upvotes *but they all have 30 to 200 comments*. That's a *ton* of comments. I realize some of it is skewed because we are a debate subreddit, especially when half of those posts are boilerplate copies of something else posted this week. Honestly, instead of one of 4 ""To Theists: why does god allow suffering"" threads with 7 upvotes and 45 comments. People could actually meaningfully discuss parts of an issue, etc. That way

**Call to Action**

There have been many meta posts with many unclear proposals. But we've gotta institute changes, which is a noble goal to some extent, but especially to anyone who wants to engage with contemporary philosophy's views on religion, we've got to give up on the idea that all starting points are equally valid and instead actually learn and adhere to a basic level of philosophical literacy that we teach to newcomers. I could see this place being really great, with a bit of neutral introductory curriculum like other subs and then fresh discussion about new topics. 

We can do better. But we have to act soon.

Examples: 

* Heliocentrism - We are not the centre of the universe

* Newton - Divine punishment/reward is not required to explain natural phenomena 
* Georges-Louis Leclerc - Earth is much older than scriptural accounts

* Germ theory of disease - Scriptual account of disease is wrong
* Big Bang Cosmology - Age and especially size of the universe are much larger than previously thought further undermining the idea that our place in the universe is special.

* Newton - Nature is orderly and law abiding 
* Big Bang - The universe had a beginning

&gt;There was a time

&gt;Now

&gt;It didn't work out that way. Unfortunately

&gt;Instead of actually debating those issues

&gt;It's all about defending turf. And it's astonishing that this comes from philosophers who should be smart enough to see why their logic is flawed.

&gt;If a scientist got involved in the question of god's existence then they were no longer thinking like a scientist—they were in the realm of metaphysics. And in order to engage in metaphysical debates you pretty much had to be a card-carrying philosopher. In other words

&gt;I think the philosophers were a little surprised at what happened next. Instead of just rolling over and admitting that philosophy could provide all the answers

&gt;Philosophers are rightly upset by this development. They all seem to have believed that their status and authority would rapidly squelch the upstart scientists who dared to intrude on their territory. They seem to have believed that all they had to do was start talking about Hume and Kant

&gt;Now they don't know what to do. Some of them just start shouting even louder that they are the authorities and whatever they say is right. That's not going to work. Some of them try using their well-honed rhetorical tricks to defend their turf. That's not going to work either. Those tricks are mostly question begging.

Now, and I ask much the same questions that Moran points out here.  There's a tendency for many of the philosophers out there, both in the ranks of the ""big name"" philosophers and in our own discussions here, to give responses that are blatant turf defense.  The most common goes something like this: ""You're philosophically unsophisticated, so I don't need to take you seriously. Go read a bunch of stuff that I like, and come back when you don't disagree with me any more.""

That's not going to fly.  I have no objection to reading, to exposure to ideas with which I disagree, or to changing my opinion.  What I *do* object to is a refusal to provide evidence that a particular work will be worth my time.  It's true that I haven't immersed myself in the works of various philosophers, and the expansions upon their work that other philosophers have made, and the subtle refutations that yet other philosophers have presented.  But I'm not an idiot.

Arguments from authority are worthless.  Many philosophers appeal to them, it means that a clearer explanation is required.  If a plain-spoken amateur like myself makes a point, pretending that it's wrong *because* I'm a plain-spoken amateur is completely unconvincing.

I understand why the turf defense occurs.  Philosophers need to maintain that they're important and relevant.  That doesn't mean I'm willing to tolerate it.  Particularly in an open forum such as this,,False,,t5_2snuc,False,,True

To Non-Theists: Do you have any real reason for liking or disliking the red light district? Beyond personal belief, because of parents, upbringing or a third thing that makes it look I thought this part out?

To Theists: Does your religion support or condem the act of payed intercourse? It could be that it attacks it because its intent is not to produce children (spilling my seed). And if it does attack it by that means

Theologians

* It is not a bare-faced lie.
* You have to be able to say it with a straight face.
* It has to relieve skepticism without arousing curiosity.
* It should seem profound.

He later references what is I think one of the most blatant examples of this tendency, Harris, Hitchens, and Dennet himself, she states the following:

&gt;God is no being at all.

And this statement is hailed as deeply profound, and see how that fits into modernist theology, and expresses many deep truths about the nature of man's relationship with the divine.  Now, compare it with this statement:

&gt; No being at all is god.

Well, it's just...primitive atheism.  Which *of course* isn't sophisticated, right?  That's the kind of thing you expect from Richard Dawkins, and it can just be laughed off as ""missing the point.""

Some of you, I'll wait.

Yep, boring atheism.

Armstrong goes on with things like ""God is Being itself"" and ""God is the God beyond God.""  The conclusion that can be drawn from this, a task that I see being studiously practiced all the time here.  In the pursuit of this goal, admittedly, it's possible that certain items of real utility will emerge; modal logic may have been invented in an attempt to obscure the blatant falsehood of the god hypothesis, but it's proven to be actually useful on occasion.  But overall, I think that we've long since reached the point, and it may even have been the point all along, and theology itself,,

For instance there's the concept of ""nothing"" that comes from Lawrence Krauss which is dependent on observation. This is fundamentally different from the so called ""philosophical nothing"" which I have often seen defined as ""having no properties"". 

Is this philosophical nothing even a coherent concept? Isn't the property of having no properties a property? 

I have also heard it argued that from this property-less nothing, then this implies some kind of conceptual boundary inside of which there is nothing but outside of which there is god. Again, this seems to gives rise to properties.

I studied the scriptures my whole life. I was raised in a Christian home with a very religious mother who brought me to church every Sunday




I wanted to be a minister since I was young and everyone told me it was my calling but over the last 3 years I have lost my faith. It wasn't a tragic event that caused this but I hard look at the facts of the religion I was raised in. 



I have questioned everything I was raised to believe in and I don't understand the God I was raised to believe in at all. I wrestled with really hard questions as i got older like:
How can God command people to not kill others and then instruct them to kill an entire people **(Deuteronomy 20:17) ""kill the Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites and Jebusites—as the LORD your God has commanded you.""**



I could never answer the question in my mind why God would have us kill groups of people yet Jesus preached about loving thy neighbor. This is a contradiction in my mind and caused me question more.  I started noticing other things that I couldn't figure out like God saying, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the sin of the fathers to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me.""**




Two things stuck out to me: 

1. How can God be jealous? I am a human and imperfect and I don't really get jealous. Jealousy seems like a selfish trait and selfishness is pride which God says he hates. 

2. Why would God punish the children for the sins of their fathers? Even in our sinful culture today we don't kill the children of murderers because we know that they are innocent. 

How can these traits and statements be a part of a loving


More and more major contradictions popped out like God not showing partiality yet clearly overlooking the sins of David and others. 


Little by little I lost my faith. 


Now I live with a fear

&gt; In philosophy of mind, in some respects, non-physical.

I like this as a starting off point

Setting aside all the variants of dualism -- Aristotelian, hammiesinkian (heh) -- all of them^1 have one thing in common:

They're all wrong.

* **Current science**

Throw together all the logical proofs you want. Philosophize to your heart's content. Wax poetic

You see, and all that jazz. While philosophers, both online and off, argue about it, the neurosciences are actually figuring it out. Again, I'll reference Wikipedia here, because the article about the [brain](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain) is quite good as well. In the intro

&gt; From a philosophical point of view, laughter and sports, and sorrows, griefs, despondency, and lamentations."" The mechanisms by which brain activity instantiates consciousness and thought have been very challenging to understand: despite rapid scientific progress, much about how brains work remains a mystery. The operations of individual brain cells are now understood in considerable detail, very different in mechanism from electronic computers

That is a pretty accurate summary of current brain science. Yes, and absolutely nothing we've discovered so far indicates that there are any non-material components of the mind. The brain isn't acting as some sort of aetheric radio receiver for signals from the soul, it's acting as a computer.

* **Objection!**

Now

Indeed it is! A computer without software would be a totally ineffective lump of matter, generating emissions and noises without doing anything useful or helpful.

Gosh, and doesn't really do very much? It's right on the tip of my tongue... I'm sure I could think of it, but my daughter just spat up on me, so I better go clean up.

* **Overruled**

Where dualists get tripped up is in imagining an **adult** brain in comparison to a computer

My daughter has learned how to crawl, and how to say ""mama"" and ""dada"" (although she hasn't quite figured out how to **stop** saying either of them, so it tends to come out as ""mamamamamama"" or ""dadadadadada""). She started out like a computer with only the BIOS, but now she has a basic operating system and a few simple apps.

With computers

So who installed my daughter's ""operating system"" and ""apps?"" Her mother and I, and the rest of her life experiences up to this point. No non-material third party is necessary for the world's most extraordinary learning computer to, well, learn.

* **Objection! Again!**

But what about me? Who programmed me? And my parents? And their parents? Aren't I just moving the problem back a step?

Nope. Go back enough generations, and have selected for it. Through the process of natural selection, this extraordinary learning computer of ours has become more extraordinary. *Homo sapiens* is a heck of a lot smarter than *homo erectus*, who in turn was smarter than *australopithecus africanus*. In minute ways that built up over time, each generation's brain built on the quality of the last generation's brain, until our contemporary situation in which IQ tests have had to become [harder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flynn_effect) to keep a score of 100 the average.

Yep, but I wouldn't be at all surprised to see that become the new 100, assuming I live long enough.

* **Goodnight

No poisoned blades were involved, just when you think -- to use a term filled with imagery I don't believe in -- it will finally give up the ghost.

It's only a matter of time before the majority of mysteries regarding brain function are solved

*The rest is silence.*

""Satan"" is a Hebrew word for ""Accuser""/""Adversary""--a judicial title equivalent to ""Prosecutor, he is unequivocally portrayed as an officer of God's court.  Get a concordance and look up all the instances of ""Satan"" and see for yourself.  In the NT there are also clear examples of ""Satan"" serving in this role.  There are other verses where ""Satan"" does seem to be portrayed as an enemy of God.  However, since ""Satan"" is a title, not a name, there is no reason to assume that it must always refer to the same being.  Compare with the use of the title ""Pharaoh"" in the Bible.  We read of Solomon marrying a daughter of ""Pharaoh,"" but this ""Pharaoh"" is clearly not the same man Joseph served under, or the one Moses dealt with.

The Serpent (also the ""Prince of Tyre"" in Ezekiel 28) is arguably a separate being.  Now

1) He would have had direct knowledge of God's power, more direct experience of him than you have.
2) The Bible is not an unbiased work.  It is written by spokesmen for God who are aiming to get people to worship and obey him.  Think
3) The Serpent might have considered it possible that he could win.
4) He could have been right.

Consider: All of the New Testament writers clearly assumed that the Battle of Armageddon and God's final victory was imminent within their own time.  Some Christians today read those same passages and assume that they mean exactly what they say--the end is nigh.  See raptureready.com.  What they forget is

There is a school of thought within Christianity called ""preterism"" that argues that the events of Revelation did indeed take place, some now standing here will see the Son of Man coming in his glory"").  The problem is, the final victory of God did not happen.  Read Revelation 21.  Does that sound like our world today?  Not to mention that all the world-wrecking displays of God's wrath never took place, nor a recognizable Battle of Armageddon.  The ""futurists"" (Christians who believe the ""end times"" prophecies are yet to happen) argue this--again, quite persuasively.  Furthermore, the Bible contains no epistle or book saying, ""Now that Armageddon happened

And so

But what if the Serpent won the Battle of Armageddon--by not showing up?  Another poster on another thread (don't recall who) questioned God's strategic sense and wondered if he (God) was familiar with Sun Tzu

Clearly not one for hypocrisy, and Mark 3, Jesus's miraculous healing draws a crowd so large that he fears that they may crush him (Mk 3:9). We find that ""when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, “He is out of his mind.” (Mk 3:21) Unable to reach him through the crowd, his mother and brothers call for him outside. ""And he was told, desiring to see you.' But he answered them

How then is Jesus to be understood when he assures us that he has ""not come to bring peace, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. And a person's enemies will be those of his own household."" (Mt 10:34-39). ""For from now on in one house there will be five divided, three against two and two against three.” (Lk 12:52).

Inevitably we arrive at Luke 14:26

&gt;“If anyone comes to me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, he cannot be my disciple.""

Confounding because, where it connotes anger and hostility. As it happens, these are *not* the emotions evoked by Jesus himself in the presence of his mother and siblings, nor by James and John with their father Zebedee, nor does Jesus instruct the two men seeking discipleship to conduct themselves in such a way. What we observe in the examples provided is something nearer to apathetic dissociation. If we could replace ""hate"" here with something like ""dissociate"", we might be on to something.

Since the destruction of the Second Temple, commonly [defined](http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0008_0_08528.html) as a refusal to speak or otherwise associate with a fellow Jew. Causeless hatred has been traditionally blamed for the destruction of the temple in 70AD. Jesus was not particularly ambivalent towards the prospect of the temple's destruction. While one of his disciples was admiring the building's exterior, he said to him “Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down.” (Mk 13:2). 

In any case, I would argue that one cannot make sense of Jesus's teachings on these matters *at all* without employing the concept of causeless hatred. Simply put, Jesus is calling for his followers to dissociate from their own kin. But the real power of Jesus's ethical system comes from a simultaneous inversion of sinat chinam in *ahavat* chinam, or ""causeless *love*"" directed at the *anti*-kin, the out-groups, the strangers and the enemies.

Living under the sword of the Roman empire instilled certain political aspirations, refusing to play by the rules of natural selection as they manifest in human politics (i.e., war). In fact, Jesus innovated an ethical system that was effectively an extreme inversion of natural selection, lifting up the sick, the poor, the weak. Jesus balanced the sinat chinam directed at kin with ahavat chinam directed at the stranger and the enemy. He clearly identified the family as a fundamental unit of society, redirecting compassion towards the fringes of society served as a means of empowering the powerless from the outside in. 

This strategy of flipping pagan morality upside down was directed towards the family, were constructed as an assault upon biology itself! The battle between flesh and spirit can be secularized as a contest between genes and memes, and we're caught in the middle. Jesus sided with the meme, utterly rejecting his biological nature through his very carefully orchestrated suicide. You'll admit, he's been a pretty successful *meme* propagator.

## The Argument
*******

So everyone should know the argument already.

1. (P1) An all good God would prevent gratuitous evil

2. (P2) Gratuitous evil exists

3. (C1) An all good God does not exist.

This can be phrased another way.

1. (Pa) An all good God would

2. (Pb) This is not the best possible world.

3. (Ca) An all good God does not exist.

*****
## Clarifications
*****

I commonly interchange gratuitous evil and unnecessary suffering - because let us be realistic - morality is about the well-being and suffering of sentient beings. We do not have moral obligations to a rock, the empty tautology ""God is God"".

*****
## Evidential Support of Soundness
*****

P1: A being that would prevent grautious evil is morally better than a being that would not. As God is the morally greatest being

P2: Whether this is the rape of a young child before being shot, we all can recognise that the world would be a better place if we could fix those issues. That is why we research cures for diseases, send money as foreign aid, and have laws against actions such as rape and homicide.

Anyone that has ever donated money for foreign aid or disaster relief, if they had the power, would stop a rape or a murder from occurring believes this too. Anyone that advocates using condoms to lower the transmission of STI's knows this. Essentially we all recognise this fact very obviously in day to day lives, it is only when trying to justify the continual absence of God that anyone tries to pretend gratuitous suffering does not exist.

Pa: Similar to P1

Pb: See P2.

## Common Counter Arguments
****

**Evil requires free will**

* Only covers moral evil, is our free will impinged? No. Thus, God could remove at the very least rape (and a host of other things) by simply removing the capacity to do so from us. Thus, there is a way to reduce suffering caused by current free will without impinging free will.

* God does not intervene in cases where free will is violated anyway. Is it a woman's will to be raped? No. Is it the rapists will to rape? Yes. If God intervenes, then it values free will more than preventing evil. As this is a morally all good being, any theist that holds this view and desires to be as good as possible should hold to it. This means never intervening to stop evil if it requires impinging free will (so doing exactly what God does). Hence, they should not stop a murder, rape, theft, etc

* Free will is generally only defined as the ability to be able to have free will in choice

**This life is only a test**

* A test for what? Are not most Gods omniscient? Any omnipotent, not God, see the next post as to why that is absurd. Also, what sort of test is it for an infant to die in childbirth?

**Suffering improves us**

* I am sure the infants that die in childbirth

**Nature contains suffering - it is an integral part of life**

* Does not solve the evidential problem of evil: why is there so much suffering? Also

**Evil and Suffering are matters of perspective**

* ""In a world without greater evil, it only addresses that the word would probably still exist. I hope we are all in agreement that on average rape is far worse than a papercut, and this the physical and emotional damage is not simply a matter of perspective.

**It is the devil

* I could simply quote Isaiah here where it explicitly says God is the source of our suffering, and is within God's power to stop. And yet he does not. This is possibly the worst counter argument, and yet it is getting more popular these days for some reason.

**God cannot just fix these things

* Because believing things on bad evidence is preferable to massively reducing the suffering in the world? Sounds like an egotistical

**This *is* the best possible world**

* This response can be applied to any world. I could go outside and give out money to the homeless, no matter what my actions, this remains the best possible world. For this to be correct, any action I or anyone else can take must necessarily have the same moral weight. So under this counter, morality essentially has no meaning as all actions are morally equivalent.

This is the reasoning that is given in this argument: everything is caused by something else, every loving wife, every evil tyrant, every sexual escapade made in inebriated circumstances.  All of these things are ultimately caused by God, who created the universe, according to this argument.  This stretches what our minds are used to in a logical sense, because we cannot regress beyond our understanding.  Instead, a celestial cork in the hole we don't understand.

In my personal experiences
In terms of historical context
In terms of translations, rape, or other sexual immorality in the like.
The Bible also teaches to love and to do everything out of love. Sins like murder, etc. are sins because they are not being done out of consideration of love for everyone involved. You can murder out of love for one person but it would not be out of true love for the person you are murdering. You could cheat on someone you are with out of love for the person you are cheating with, but not out of love for the one you're cheating on. My point being, sins are sins because they are out of selfish intent and not out of love for who is involved. However, Homosexuality can be purely out of love, love for the person you are with.
Another key argument is nowhere do we have anything stating that Jesus said a thing against homosexuality. As a Christian I think of myself as a follower of Christ and Christ alone. The truth is the Bible is simply a collection of letters, and poems that were not decided as canon by the church until long long long after Jesus and his disciples/apostles were gone. Do I believe the Bible is useful? Certainly. Do I believe it is the be-all end-all of my beliefs? No, that is the teachings of Jesus alone, the teachings of loving everyone.

TL;DR My reason is I believe historical context and issues with translation show there is no evidence agaisnt homosexual love.

When I look at modern religions such as Christianity they have deities who are supposed to be the creators of the universe but there are numerous religions and beliefs that are vastly different that pre-date them. In my mind a being who created the universe should have been worshipped consistently from as early in the time line as history records worship. I have trouble understanding how someone can attribute creation to a deity who has only been ""known"" for a few thousand years.

- Why is it that your deities who have existed since the beginning of time have only been known to man for at most a few thousand years? 

- Why did they allow the countless other religions before your own? 

- How do you explain that the oldest known (*and therefore closest to the ""creation"" which would have been the point of most active intervention by a deity one would think*) ""religions"" appear to be animistic with little to no parallel to your own religion?

- Should not the real creator if such a being exists have been worshipped consistently from creation?

1341168814.0,vvzkb,"Descartes, mathematics, and evidentialism",lordzork,29,72

There is [a youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9x_oa--KAc&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;index=21&amp;feature=plpp_video) in which someone referring to himself by the name of ""Evid3nc3"" argues that mathematics is fundamentally empirical in nature

The broader subject of the video is the narrator's personal conception of evidentialism, *empirical* evidence, and visual or sensory evidence. The overall thrust of the narrator's evidentialist argument is to privilege empirical evidence as a necessary component of valid knowledge. Thus, I will only be referring to *empirical* evidence in this post, even though the narrator uses all of the aforementioned terms interchangeably.

**The problem**

If valid knowledge must be supported by empirical evidence, which would make mathematics empirical in nature. Yet mathematics is famously thought to be *a priori*, which is to say that it is prior to or independent of experience. If this is true, then mathematics would be a fatal counterexample to the narrator's argument for empirical evidentialism. 

**Evid3nc3's attempted solution**

Our narrator addresses this problem in the context of Descartes' Meditation III

&gt; ""Descartes makes the argument that some high-level rational beliefs are self-evident. For example, 'self-evident.' But I disagree. Rather, when pressed to do so, we *can* justify the belief that '2 + 3 = 5' using evidence [sic]."" ([6:07](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=367s))

We are then given an example of evidential mathematical justification in the form of a scenario in which items are arranged into groups which are then compared. Let's call this **Argument #1 for empirical mathematics**. 

Our narrator seems content that this scenario provides an adequate empirical justification for the mathematical proposition in question, not that they *are* or *must be* justified empirically by their nature. 

Descartes addresses this issue by distinguishing what he calls *imagination*, which is a purely rational activity. He writes that when he imagines a triangle, he doesn't merely understand its geometrical nature, but he actually envisions its three lines in his mind. ""But,"" he writes, ""if I want to think of a chiliagon, although I understand that it is a figure consisting of a thousand sides… I do not in the same way imagine the thousand sides or see them as if they were present before me… I notice quite clearly that imagination requires a peculiar effort of mind which is not required for understanding; this additional effort of mind clearly shows the difference between imagination and pure understanding."" (VI

So we may very well visualize (imagine) arithmetical procedures being performed on collections of items; we may even actually perform these procedures on actual collections and items. But the truth of the relevant mathematical propositions has no connection to these procedures since it can be established with complete independence from them. Thus

In fact, we can see that the counting scenario also fails as a demonstration of the allegedly empirical nature of mathematics.

**Objection #1 to the self-evidence of mathematical propositions**

Our narrator continues:

&gt; ""Now I suspect one reason why Descartes was so inclined to declare that '2 + 3 = 5 is self evident' was unconsciously due to social pressure. There are certain beliefs that are so commonly held by individuals in our society that even questioning them evokes [sic] ridicule. In fact, and people who say they are may be unconsciously succumbing to social pressure."" ([6:46](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=406s))

Let us applaud the bravery of our fearless narrator

In reference to his famous initial proposition, emphasis mine) And again: ""Let whoever can do so deceive me, he will never bring it about that… two and three added together are more or less than five, or anything of this kind in which I see a manifest contradiction."" (III, 36) 

So Descartes' criteria for propositional self-evidence are 1) that he can perceive the idea clearly and distinctly and 2) that the idea cannot be false without generating a contradiction. Our narrator's bizarre and unsupported notion that the self-evident nature of mathematical propositions is a function of societal consensus simply has no relevance to what Descartes is talking about. 

**Objection #2 to the self-evidence of mathematical propositions**

Our narrator advances a second objection to Descartes' argument for self-evidence:

&gt; ""Most of us have been trained in basic arithmetic starting at a young age, but in reality, when we think that, we may be unconsciously making an evidential evaluation of that proposition."" ([7:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=476s))

In other words

But once again, which is just that they are apodeictic because they *cannot be false* without generating a contradiction, which is why we can know with certainty that they are absolutely true. As was described above, this is just what Descartes means when he refers to mathematical propositions as being self-evident. But no amount of empirical evidence can ever provide this level of certainty. No matter how many times we combine collections of items and achieve the same result, we will never achieve the certainty that Descartes recognizes as a function of the apodeictic nature of mathematics.

**Argument #2 for empirical mathematics: tool usage**

&gt; ""The place of [non-rational] evidence in justifying abstract mathematical propositions becomes even more clear as the mathematics becomes more complicated. How do you verify your understanding of a basic principle of algebra? How do you verify that you understand integration by parts? How do you verify that the internal angles of the triangle add up to 180&amp;deg;? By working out the problem on paper, or textbook, all of which constitute a form of visual evidence. ([8:30](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;list=PLA0C3C1D163BE880A&amp;v=g9x_oa--KAc#t=510s))

In this argument, it isn't clear that we've even been provided with a valid example of empirical verification.

There's no denying that one may employ a variety of physical media or objects to assist in understanding a mathematical concept

Furthermore, and yet I can demonstrate various properties of these shapes, just as I can with the triangle."" (V, 65) That such demonstration is possible is simply more evidence in favor of the *a priori* nature of mathematics.

**Conclusion**

Evid3nc3 doesn't seem to understand what Descartes means when he refers to mathematical propositions as being self-evident. As a consequence, they fail because they are irrelevant to Descartes' conception of self-evidence, and no relevant argument accompanies them.

Additionally, rational nature of mathematics still stands as a counterexample to empirical evidentialism.",,False,,t5_2snuc,False,gold,

John 20:17 and 27

As if the touch of a woman is somehow different than the touch of a man. Not as direct sexism as seen in other parts of the Bible but in light of Paul's writing it definitely sends the wrong message.

Paul treats women unequally

1 Corinthians 14:34-35
&gt; As in all the congregations of the saints, as the Law says. If they want to inquire about something, they should ask their own husbands at home; for it is disgraceful for a woman to speak in the church

1 Corinthians 11:3-10
&gt; But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, but any woman who prays or prophesies with her head unveiled dishonors her head--it is the same as if her head were shaven. For if a woman will not veil herself, then she should cut off her hair; but if it is disgraceful for a woman to be shorn or shaven, let her wear a veil. **For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God; but woman is the glory of man. (For man was not made from woman, but woman from man. Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.)** That is why a woman ought to have a veil on her head

Finally

God made laws for the Israelite that treated women very differently then men

There are quite a few philosophical questions about time. How it functions; whether future events are deterministically set or not; whether the truth value of a proposition is tensed or tenseless. And so on. It's a big topic

The other camp asserts that there are problems with an *A* series that result in contradictions (which I'll go into in detail below), simultaneous with, etc."" When ordered this way, they're called *B relations* or a *B* series.

One of the main differences between an *A* series and a *B* series is that the truth value of a proposition using *A* series properties can change. If I say ""yesterday was Wednesday,"" this is only true so long as today is the following Thursday. As of the time I wrote this, the proposition is true. But tomorrow, it won't be. Propositions using *B* series relations, on the other hand, are always true, regardless of when they are uttered. ""The day preceding Thursday, 2012 is Wednesday

John McTaggart, and that a series made up of *A* properties is essential to time. Since *B* relations are fixed, they don't describe genuine change, while *A* series positions change constantly.

And because of the contradictions that arise with *A* properties

Now obviously, there are even fewer proponents of what has come to be known as the ""A-Theory"" of time. John McTaggart was on to something.

---

**The A-Theory contradictions**

McTaggart's solution of calling time an illusion is only one of many, and I have no idea whether I accept any of the theories under the ""B-Theory"" umbrella, or something else entirely. But it seems that most philosophers today agree with McTaggart that the A-Theory is fundamentally flawed.

First

McTaggart predicted some objections on that. Quoting the Stanford website:

&gt; One response to this argument that McTaggart anticipates involves claiming that it's not true of any time, the objection goes, we must say that *t* was future at some moment of past time and will be past at some moment of future time. But this objection fails, according to McTaggart, because the additional times that are invoked in order to explain *t*'s possession of the incompatible A properties must themselves possess all of the same A properties (as must any further times invoked on account of these additional times, and so on *ad infinitum*). Thus, according to McTaggart, but

Now

No infinite regress that must be stopped? No A-Theory? Then no Unmoved Mover.

And then there's the empirical problem. In physics

&gt; According to [the special theory of relativity]... there is no such thing as absolute simultaneity. But if there is no such thing as absolute simultaneity, there cannot be objective facts about A properties, and so the passage of time cannot be an objective feature of the world.

So time is subjective

If you accept special relativity -- and you should -- then this kills the cosmological arguments. **All** of them. They are in contradiction with empirically observable reality.

For most professional philosophers, philosophers reject it in favor of either a B-Theory variant or, more commonly, something else entirely.

And that makes sense. To argue for the A-Theory, of course... Karl Popper famously likened Albert Einstein to Parmenides, and dismissed special relativity. Today, that seems kind of silly, and history shows Einstein was right.

There's only one group of philosophers who accept the A-Theory in any large numbers: 40.4% of [philosophers of religion](http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=Target+faculty&amp;areas0=22&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=coarse). Doesn't that seem odd? Why are so many religious philosophers in favor of a time theory that is rejected by most of their peers? Among the other philosophers, support for it is practically non-existent. It seems only philosophers of religion are willing to go on record opposing Einstein in large numbers.

So now I ask you, reject? And if you're a supporter of the cosmological arguments, have you looked into philosophy of time at all? Does support for Thomism, for example, necessarily entail support for the A-Theory of time?

Now

* Neither is my free will diminished because I've never been placed in a situation where I can choose to shoot or not shoot somebody. In other words

Now I propose that there exist solutions to the problem of evil, and which would contain no evil, or much less of it. An explanation is needed why none of these solutions, or something in the same vein have been used. I present a list of alternative worlds that would solve the problem.

World W^b is populated exclusively by bacteria. They're harmless to each other. They have free will -- they can take any action they're capable of

But okay

World W^p consists of Gardens of Eden on parallel planes. Each inhabitant has a Garden to themselves. There's no way to reach any parallel plane. God grants them complete dominion over their Garden. The inhabitant is as capable as anybody living today. They can do evil

The protest I got to this one is ""But worlds where morally significant actions can be taken are better!"". This misses the point. Plantinga's argument isn't that it's somehow better when worlds contain, this is not ideal, but with these constraints, God's hand is forced, and this is as good as it gets"". The entire reason why the PoE exist is because evil is undesirable, and we need to explain why it's there. Clearly, a world that couldn't contain evil would be better

But even if I accept this constraint, the universe just works in such a way that free agents are intangible respect of each other, except when they're both aware of each other, and consent to each other's action.

For instance in W^m, and consents to it.
W^m doesn't remove all evil. Cain can still lie, and psychologically torture him until he consents to being killed. But it does remove a significant amount of evil. Killing and rape become much harder, war becomes much less practical. Force becomes much less effective -- it's hard to enslave people if they can just leave and you can't do anything to stop them. Escaping violence is trivial -- just don't consent to it.

Plantinga's argument as I see it relies on driving God into a corner: define omnipotence as being subject to weird external limitations like transworld depravities that God somehow can't get rid of

(I sighed a bit, for I knew very few English Lit majors who are equipped to teach me science, but I am very aware of the vast state of my ignorance and I am prepared to learn as much as I can from anyone, so I read on.)

&gt;It seemed that in one of my innumerable essays

&gt;I didn't go into detail in the matter, as shown in the theory of relativity worked out between 1905 and 1916. We also know the basic rules governing the subatomic particles and their interrelationships, since these are very neatly described by the quantum theory worked out between 1900 and 1930. What's more, we have found that the galaxies and clusters of galaxies are the basic units of the physical universe, as discovered between 1920 and 1930.

&gt;These are all twentieth-century discoveries

&gt;The young specialist in English Lit, and in every century they were proved to be wrong. It follows that the one thing we can say about our modern ""knowledge"" is that it is wrong. The young man then quoted with approval what Socrates had said on learning that the Delphic oracle had proclaimed him the wisest man in Greece. ""If I am the wisest man,"" said Socrates, ""it is because I alone know that I know nothing."" the implication was that I was very foolish because I was under the impression I knew a great deal.

&gt;My answer to him was, they were wrong. When people thought the earth was spherical, they were wrong. But if you think that thinking the earth is spherical is just as wrong as thinking the earth is flat, then your view is wronger than both of them put together.""

&gt;The basic trouble

&gt;However

&gt;When my friend the English literature expert tells me that in every century scientists think they have worked out the universe and are always wrong

&gt;In the early days of civilization,"" because the earth does not look flat. It looks chaotically bumpy, with hills, valleys, ravines, cliffs, and so on.

&gt;Of course there are plains where, where the first historical civilization (one with writing) developed, that of the Sumerians.

&gt;Perhaps it was the appearance of the plain that persuaded the clever Sumerians to accept the generalization that the earth was flat; that if you somehow evened out all the elevations and depressions

&gt;Another way of looking at it is to ask what is the ""curvature"" of the earth's surface Over a considerable length

&gt;Nowadays, terribly wrong, absolutely. But it isn't. The curvature of the earth is nearly 0 per mile, so that although the flat-earth theory is wrong, it happens to be nearly right. That's why the theory lasted so long.

&gt;There were reasons, about 350 B.C., the Greek philosopher Aristotle summarized them. First, certain stars disappeared beyond the Southern Hemisphere as one traveled north, and beyond the Northern Hemisphere as one traveled south. Second, the earth's shadow on the moon during a lunar eclipse was always the arc of a circle. Third, here on the earth itself

&gt;All three observations could not be reasonably explained if the earth's surface were flat

&gt;What's more, it would end up as a sphere. A given volume of matter is, on the average, closer to a common center if it is a sphere than if it is any other shape whatever.

&gt;About a century after Aristotle,000 miles in circumference.

&gt;The curvature of such a sphere is about 0.000126 per mile, and one not easily measured by the techniques at the disposal of the ancients. The tiny difference between 0 and 0.000126 accounts for the fact that it took so long to pass from the flat earth to the spherical earth.

&gt;Mind you, can be extremely important. That difference mounts up. The earth cannot be mapped over large areas with any accuracy at all if the difference isn't taken into account and if the earth isn't considered a sphere rather than a flat surface. Long ocean voyages can't be undertaken with any reasonable way of locating one's own position in the ocean unless the earth is considered spherical rather than flat.

&gt;Furthermore, however, postulates an earth that is both endless and yet finite, and it is the latter postulate that is consistent with all later findings.

&gt;So, it is wrong enough to be discarded in favor of the spherical-earth theory.

&gt;And yet is the earth a sphere?

&gt;No, all straight lines that pass from one point on its surface, through the center, to another point on its surface) have the same length.

&gt;That

&gt;What gave people the notion the earth wasn't a true sphere? To begin with

&gt;However, but distinct eclipses. That meant that Jupiter and Saturn were not true spheres.

&gt;Isaac Newton, but only if it were not rotating. If it were rotating, a centrifugal effect would be set up that would lift the body's substance against gravity, and this effect would be greater the closer to the equator you progressed. The effect would also be greater the more rapidly a spherical object rotated, and Jupiter and Saturn rotated very rapidly indeed.

&gt;The earth rotated much more slowly than Jupiter or Saturn so the effect should be smaller

&gt;The earth has an equatorial bulge,927 miles). The shortest diameter is from the North Pole to the South Pole and this ""polar diameter"" is 12,711 kilometers (7,900 miles).

&gt;The difference between the longest and shortest diameters is 44 kilometers (27 miles)

&gt;To put it another way, curvature is 0.000126 per mile everywhere (or 8 inches per mile). On the earth's oblate spheroidal surface, the curvature varies from 7.973 inches to the mile to 8.027 inches to the mile.

&gt;The correction in going from spherical to oblate spheroidal is much smaller than going from flat to spherical. Therefore, it is not as wrong as the notion of the earth as flat.

&gt;Even the oblate-spheroidal notion of the earth is wrong, it was able to measure the local gravitational pull of the earth--and therefore its shape--with unprecedented precision. It turned out that the equatorial bulge south of the equator was slightly bulgier than the bulge north of the equator, and that the South Pole sea level was slightly nearer the center of the earth than the North Pole sea level was.

&gt;There seemed no other way of describing this than by saying the earth was pear-shaped, and the adjustment of curvature was in the millionths of an inch per mile.

&gt;In short, may be imagining that because all theories are wrong, the earth may be thought spherical now, but cubical next century, and a hollow icosahedron the next, and a doughnut shape the one after.

&gt;What actually happens is that once scientists get hold of a good concept they gradually refine and extend it with greater and greater subtlety as their instruments of measurement improve. Theories are not so much wrong as incomplete.

&gt;This can be pointed out in many cases other than just the shape of the earth. Even when a new theory seems to represent a revolution

&gt;Copernicus switched from an earth-centered planetary system to a sun-centered one. In doing so, and eventually the geocentric theory was just left behind. It was precisely because the old theory gave results that were fairly good by the measurement standards of the time that kept it in being so long.

&gt;Again

&gt;But when careful observation showed that the earth and life were changing at a rate that was very tiny but not zero

&gt;If the rate of change were more rapid

&gt;Since the refinements in theory grow smaller and smaller

&gt;The Greeks introduced the notion of latitude and longitude, and we still use latitude and longitude today.

&gt;The Sumerians were probably the first to establish the principle that planetary movements in the sky exhibit regularity and can be predicted

&gt;Naturally, they need only be considered incomplete.

[Argument from inconsistent revelations](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_inconsistent_revelations)

&gt;It asserts that it is unlikely that God exists because many theologians and faithful adherents have produced conflicting and mutually exclusive revelations. The argument states that since a person not privy to revelation must either accept it or reject it based solely upon the authority of its proponent



[Argument from nonbelief](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_nonbelief)

&gt;The premise of the argument is that if God existed (and wanted humanity to know it)



[Argument from poor design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_poor_design)

&gt;It is based on the following chain of reasoning:

    An omnipotent

    Organisms have features that are suboptimal.

    Therefore

&gt;The argument is structured as a basic Modus tollens: if ""creation"" contains many defects, but rather as a reductio ad absurdum of the well-known argument from design, which runs as follows:

    Living things are too well-designed to have originated by chance.

    Therefore

    This creator is God.

[God of the gaps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps)

&gt;God of the gaps is a type of theological fallacy in which gaps in scientific knowledge are taken to be evidence or proof of God's existence. The term was invented by Christian theologians not to discredit theism but rather to discourage reliance on teleological arguments for God's existence.



[Incompatible-properties argument](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Incompatible-properties_argument)

&gt;The incompatible-properties argument is the idea that no description of God is consistent with reality. For example

&gt;The paradox states that if a being can perform any action, it cannot perform all actions. Yet, on the other hand, if it cannot create a task it is unable to perform, then there exists something it cannot do.

In my minor musings on the topic of religion

1. Im not really that interested in people who are raised in their religion and never give it up. I feel that every argument they use to justify their beliefs requires them to already believe in their particular god.

2. Im not really that interested in why atheists dont believe. I think its pretty apparent why they dont

3. Im supremely interested in people that change religions or adapt to one at some point in their life. Christians becoming Muslims

#3 isnt interesting because I feel they are using good arguments. I find them interesting because they were at some point in a pliable state and something changed their mind. Rather than leave their religion

In the case of a lifelong adherent to a particular religion. Especially those of you who are active here. I think most of you would admit that there isnt an argument that leads to the god you worship. If there is feel free to share. You likely went through a period of doubt at some point in your faith

Like theists, and I would imagine most of us stopped being religious because we couldnt find a reason to continue that belief. It stopped being useful to us, and became detrimental to us in some aspect.

People that have swapped religions though... to go from one god idea that you find useful to another idea that you find useful. What causes that? You obviously went through a period of questioning much like life long adherents to a religion and former theists did

So my question is what do you think caused that change in you? Where were you raised? Do you know how old you were when you stopped believing in your original god? Was there a particular argument that convinced you to adopt a new religion?

Well, sometimes by verse inspiration. The rest is either Chreia from the culture or hand of Mark, or obvious invention. Some things are difficult to classify, of course....

Mark is fiction. If there was really a community spurring Mark to write this, or something Hellenistic. Exegetes are fond of arguing that Matthew cannot be a disciple, else why would he have copied Mark? That is just as true of Mark: if he knew stories about the HJ, why did he bother to parallel the OT?

Vorkosigan

And seeing as the other gospels simply copy from Mark (the synoptic gospels)

1340130951.0,vacjw,To all: Desideratum for truth claims,khafra,29,3,60,"""**My philosophy/religion is the correct one

This is an easy claim to make. A scientologist, an astrologist, a discordian, or a dervish can make that exact same claim. It costs nothing to make, and it can never be verified.  If someone tries to test the claim by studying, and finds it wanting, their study was obviously neither sufficient nor sincere.

Indeed, you might never finish--and since they're so easy to make, even a single person can present them faster than you can deal with them.

This is the opposite of what we want from truth claims: What we want is claims that are hard to make

Scientology understands this, the ratio of apparent claim difficulty to verification difficulty keeps many people from dismissing it outright.

Some more theatrical sects of Christianity recognize this as well.  ""I can handle poisonous snakes without danger, unless you're being deceived outright that the snakes are actively venomous.

Complexity theory, easy-to-verify claims. ""[This is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem) the shortest path between these two graph nodes,"" or ""[this is](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem) the heaviest combination of those items that's under the weight limit,"" are canonical examples.

Bayesians understand that any belief they hold has a probability attached to it.  As such, is a good way to increase the cost of your claim.  Even simply [writing down your confidence level](http://predictionbook.com/) helps, because of the social costs of being publically wrong.


So, try considering the ratio of claim difficulty to verification difficulty. If the ratio goes the wrong direction, you might want to change its form into something better.

1338755652.0,uj0ru,To Thomists: Defend final causality,Cortlander,30,6,100,"I am making this post because recently our resident thomist Hammisink has began to repost his arguments.

However there is a problem:

Many (most?) of hammie's arguments depend on Final Causality. ([Teleology](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleology) is just a word meaning you believe final causality exists).

Now what is final causality? To put it simply it is the metaphysical assumption that everything has purpose. In other words

Final Causality is one way of explaining why we get specific effects in this universe. Example: When you strike a match against a certain chemical, they attract each other.  

Now you will often see hammie use the match example as a supposed defense of why Final Causality is true. However this is wrong. Or more specifically, is true. 

This is because clearly there are other possible explanations for why we get specific effects in this universe. Indeed the one I believe is true is that there are a system of basic rules which govern matter/energy. Natural Laws if you will. Under this system why does a match ignite when we strike it? Because the laws of the universe dictate that the chemical compound X oxidizes under Y conditions (energy levels

So my proposal is this: If you wish to use teleology and Final Cause as base assumptions in your arguments (such as for the 5 ways) then you need to establish why we should think Final Causality is anything more than a rather unparsimonious way of describing the natural laws of the universe. 

Note: [Here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) is a good example of why the idea of complex systems arising from simple laws is plausible.

So, put at the start of each appropriate argument ""Note: This argument relies on your acceptance of teleology. If you do not accept teleology, this argument is defeated, or at least incoherent.""

Second Edit: It occurs to me that I forgot one point. I need to explain what *would* show teleology to be true. It is fairly simple

I think that's a good idea considering there are probably just as many variations in atheistic thinking as there are in any one religion. So post what you think would be helpful questions for defining the specific atheistic views a person holds. I'll start:

1. Are you a solipsist?
    
2. Do you believe in objective morality
   
3. Do you believe there is a lack of evidence for any god
   
4. Why do you think the universe exists?

They form a prediction based on God's motives and abilities and compare them to the world we live in.

1. Evil exists in the form of unrequired suffering (suffering not needed for a greater good and is avoidable)

2. Either God can't stop it

3. It's not because God can't stop it (it would require very little power) and it's not because God won't stop it (there is at least one instance where it would be better for God to intercede)

1363806544.0,1aoicp,Morality is subjective. Those who think otherwise are confused due to not recognizing hidden assumptions.,CHollman82,57,31,242,"First of all

Something that is subjective is a thought, etc... Mathematics is subjective, which does NOT imply that 1+1 can equal whatever you want unless you completely disassociate it from objective reality (which is possible in mathematics, by the way... there is no reason it has to have any bearing on reality).

Morality/Ethics (for this discussion let's consider the two interchangeable because most people do

Most people who consider morality to be objective assume that the goal of any moral framework is to maximize human well being and minimize human suffering. If we take this stated goal and consider it to be axiomatic then they are almost right

This assumed goal is a minmax function (minimization of human suffering/maximization of human well being). **It is not the only possible goal of a moral framework**... in fact there are a near infinite number of such possible goals

So, another might argue that the best goal is the maximization of free time to pursue our own interests, another person might argue that the best goal is minimization of human suffering.... these goals are based on what the individual proponents consider to be important, what they value. Values are subjective, what I value might not be what you value and there is nothing objective to tell us who's values are better (again, better according to what?).

If we are to take as axiomatic that a moral framework should work to minimize human suffering and maximize human well being (or any other stated goal really) then morality becomes pseudo-objective relative to that axiom. That does not mean that morality is objective

1. A reliable method for discerning truth should tend toward the same answer regardless of the culture, and background of the person applying the method. Moreover, different people from different backgrounds applying the same reliable method should, over time, converge on an answer.

2. Religious methods of discerning truth (tradition, personal experience, interpretation of texts) give very different answers based on culture, location, upbringing and background. Also, religious methods have been applied for thousands of years and there is no signs of convergence.

The fact is that every year new cults

Edit: Thank you for many excellent replies. A few primary confusions I would like to clear up. First, analysis of scripture, prayer, visions, tongues/interpretation, authority, tradition

My example was biology — applying the scientific method in developed nations has given us the theory of evolution, and genetics. However, even a less developed nation applying the scientific method would come to the conclusion that organisms can be classified into types in some kind of hierarchy (plant vs animal, mammal vs reptile, dog vs wolf).

Below I will attempt to outline why conceding debates may be to yours and everyone's advantage sometimes.

A debate is a structured argument between two or more people. Debate embodies the ideals of reasoned argument, such as religion and philosophy, without descending to insults, emotional appeals or personal bias. A key characteristic of debate is that it rarely ends in agreement, but rather allows for a robust analysis of the question at hand.

Because debate seldom ends in actual agreement, we dig our heels in, becoming ever more rigid in our cognitions and biases.

This is problematic for several reasons. Many of us like to describe ourselves as “truth-seekers”. We debate in order to discern falsehood or fallacy from truth and fact. We rightly interrogate the ideas put forth by our debating opponents that we might be able to gauge the rightfulness of their position and, more often than we care to admit, we are so convinced of that we are right and our opponent is wrong that we cannot even consider that there might be at least some truth to their arguments. Thus, the pursuit for truth becomes an illusion as truth-seeking takes second-stage to self-righteousness.

Still others of us are more inclined toward competitive, it also retards us by hindering any actual shifting in ideas.

And I so propose the idea of being prepared to concede debates, you may argue against this belief and bring to the argument such evidence to support your position that there is “no God”. In spite of your evidence, I still believe in the existence of a God. But, believing that I cannot bring to the argument anywhere near the same amount of evidence or evidence to equal or superior validity and being unable to identify any logical fallacies in your argument, I will concede that you have mounted a better argument than I was able to mount. Thus I concede to you. My concession does not mean that I am now an atheist.

Similarly

So why should we concede? Why not just do what we already do and just walk away from the debate or hound our opponents until they give up and walk away? The short answer is

Now, I become Debater C. And while Debater B might eventually come to concede to Debater A; my debate with Debater B represents a discrete debate and remains unresolved until either they or I can mount the better argument. Therefore, while Debater A and Debater C are arguing for the same thing against Debater B, each debate is ultimately independent of one another. 

If I don't want to debate Debater B, this could be seen as somewhat unfair to Debater B because it artificially augments Debater A's debate.

Perhaps one final reason why conceding based on argument style rather than “truth” might be worthwhile considering is that it might address what could be one of the greatest obstacles to many debates in this subreddit – animosity. While animosity either toward a particular debater, the reality seems to be that animosity is a significant factor in perpetuating or hindering the flow of many debates. Conceding with reflection, perhaps a meta-discussion of the debate itself, might help to overcome some of that animosity as we all strive to help one another in becoming better debaters.

It seems to me that there is a spectrum of understanding this debate and that on one level we have the face value understanding of it, a moderate level would be something around understanding Aquinas' first way, and the deeper level being somewhere around understanding how alethic modality applies to the argument from contingency.

I think I'm pretty well through the first two levels and have been trying to delve into the third

After trying to dig through it a bit

1) Physical evidence

2) The suggestion of authorities or most peers

3) gut instinct/preconception

When it comes to God, but the authoritative suggestion disagrees (most high level philosophers/scientists don't believe in God), and my gut tells me that God either doesn't exist, or there's something completely fucked going on that I have no idea about (for instance, an appropriate rebuttal to the problem of evil might be that no one else exists and hence my own suffering is the only input to the problem of evil, and I previously consented to suffering in some pre-birth state and hence it's not evil)

1350230071.0,11gpez,To Mormons:  Not really a debate more of an attempt to understand one of your beliefs.  Polygamy.  ,Adtwerk,31,6,18,"First some background that might help people not familiar with the topic.  Mormon's have 4 books of scripture (The Bible

Polygamy was revealed by Joseph Smith and is found in [Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng).   Polygamy was openly practiced by [Joseph Smith](http://www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/the-many-wives-of-joseph-smith.html)

In 1890 Mormon prophet Wilford Woodruff stopped the practice of polyagmy with [Official Decleration # 1](https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/od/1?lang=eng) (its found near the end of the doctrine and covernants).   However section 132 was left unchanged.   Now the way I understood Woodrufff's decleration was in this line 

&gt;And I now publicly declare that my advice to the Latter-day Saints is to refrain from contracting any marriage forbidden by the law of the land.

Polygamy was illegal so Mormons were to stop practicing it but polygamy was still an important docrtine of the Mormon church.   Could a Mormon help me understand this?   What would happen if polygamy were legalized today?  What about countries where it is not illegal?  

I have found one instance where it is still being practiced today in theory

Hypothetical A:  Husband and wife#1 get married by the state and married by God in the Mormon temple.   They are married for eternity.  Wife#1 dies.  Husband decides to remarry.  Husband and wife#2 get married by the state and married by God.  Husband is now married to both #1 and #2 for eternity.  Everyone dies goes to heaven husband has two wives.

Hypothetical B: Husband#1 and wife get married and sealed in the temple.  Husband#1 dies.  Wife decides to remarry.  She gets married by the state to husband#2 but now she must make a decision.  The mormon church will not allow women to be sealed to more then one man.  She can either marry husband#2 by the state only and return to husband#1 when she dies.  Or she can cancel her sealing with husband#1 and seal herself to husband#2.

So in theory it would seem polygamy is still practiced.  Am i understanding this right?  Why then is polygamy not practiced in countries where it is legal?  If the law changes in america will official decleration become null and void?  I am confused.

___

**Formal Statement of the Argument**

**B: The Relevant Background Information**

1. The universe is intelligible.

**E: The Evidence to be Explained**

1. So many natural phenomena can be explained naturalistically
2. The history of science contains numerous examples of naturalistic explanations replacing supernatural ones and no examples of supernatural explanations replacing naturalistic ones. 

**Rival Explanatory Hypotheses**

T: classical theism

N: metaphysical naturalism: the hypothesis that the universe is a closed system

**The Argument Formulated**

1.  E is known to be true.
2.  Pr(E | B &amp; N) &gt;! Pr(E | B &amp; T).
3.  T is not much more probable intrinsically than N.
4. Therefore

**Defense of (2)** 

N entails that any true explanations must be naturalistic ones.  Thus, if T is true, then it could have been the case that that successful scientific explanations were supernatural explanations. For example, biology could have discovered that all animals are not the relatively modified descendants of a common ancestor; neuroscience could have discovered no correlations at all between human minds and brains, etc. If the history of science were like that, then that would have supported T over N.  But then the success of science in finding naturalistic explanations must be evidence for N over T. How strong is this evidence?

**What I mean by ""God"":**

In order to clarify and limit the scope of my arguments, has the following attributes:

* An entity that transcends all physical attributes.
* An entity that transcends all logic.
* An entity that is a Mind and has a Will.
* An entity that creates from material nothingness and sustains every other entity.

***
    EDIT: An objection has been raised that I cannot use logic to prove the existence
    of God if He transcends all logic. I will reply to this in a comment and link to it here.
***

It follows from the physical and logical transcendence of God that He is also single and indivisible. This I will argue after the arguments for the existence of God.

I have two arguments for the existence of God

* *Argument A:* I exist
* *Argument B:* The universe exists

Argument A is the more powerful argument for me.



**Argument A: ~~I exist

* *""I"" means the mind and not the body*

In order to demonstrate this argument, which I will refer to as the mind. *I* does **not** mean the physical body, in which case this argument would become identical to Argument B.



* *The mind exists*

The existence of the mind is evidenced by subjective



* *The existence of the mind is relevant to both you and me*

I believe the existence of the mind is a valid basis from which to build an argument, in fact, [zombies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_zombie).



* *I am not self-caused*

In the same vein that I know that I exist, not how or why I am in existence.



* *I am not eternal*

I also know that I am not eternal



* *Therefore

Since I am not self-caused



* *The Creator is a Mind with a Will*

No arrangement or interaction of mindless entities can give rise to minds. The quality of myself having a mind must come from another entity having a quality of mind equal to or greater than the quality of mind possessed by myself. Similarly



* *The Creator transcends all physical attributes*

No arrangement or interaction of physical entities can give rise to entities that transcend the physical. I transcend the physical, the Creator also transcends the physical.



* *The Creator transcends all logic*

The workings of the mind cannot be described by logic. For example, that I have a will, etc. All these I know *a priori* and cannot use logic to demonstrate. Since the mind cannot be described by logic, and yet the Creator created my mind, the Creator transcends logic.



* *The Creator sustains me*

Just as the Creator created the mind, since I did not cause myself in the first place. And since I needed to be caused to exist, I also need to be continually caused to exist, i.e., sustained in existence. Therefore, the Creator must continue to sustain me in every possible way, including from moment to moment in time.



* *Conclusion*

And so, since I am obviously an immaterial entity), that has a Will and a Mind, and transcends physicality and logic. This entity is God.





**Argument B: The universe exists



* *The universe means all physical things*

Let me first clarify what I mean by ""universe"". The universe here refers to all of physical existence. In some theories of cosmology



* *What is a physical entity?*

A physical entity can be matter, forces, potentials, fields, space-time, vacuum, quantum states, branes



* *Why I am not arguing that the universe had a beginning

I could have argued that the universe has a beginning, our cosmological theories today focus on the evolution of the universe after the creation of space-time, and it can be argued that this does not constitute a true beginning of the universe (e.g., Stephen Hawking's argument that resorts to the use of imaginary time). Instead, I will argue that the universe was not self-caused. This is a much more powerful argument which transcends all theories of cosmology, including those which state the universe is infinite in spatial and/or past-temporal extent (even though I think this is impossible).



* *The universe is a closed system*

The universe and everything in it constitutes a closed system. This means that physical entities (e.g.



* *Physical entities are not self-caused*

[Noether's theorem](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether's_theorem) gives us a profound insight into the nature of conservation and invariance of physical quantities. For example, they must necessarily transform from one quantity to another, from one form to another, but never be created nor destroyed. Since physical entities cannot be created nor destroyed, they cannot create themselves nor destroy themselves. Therefore, they are not self-caused. In other words: atoms are not self-caused, galaxies are not self-caused, energy is not self-caused



* *The universe is not self-caused*

The universe is simply the physical entity consisting of all physical entities



* *The universe has a Creator*

Since the universe is not self-caused



* *The universe is not self-sustaining*

In order for any physical entity to be self-sustaining, so they also cannot sustain their continued existence or that of others. Therefore, physical entities are not self-sustaining. Since the universe is a physical entity, it is also not self-sustaining. Note that space and time themselves are physical entities and part of the universe, hence even a universe that is infinite either space and time or in both is also not self-sustaining.



* *The Creator sustains the universe*

Since the universe is not self-sustaining



*The Creator transcends all physical attributes*

Since the Creator creates and sustains everything physical



* *The Creator transcends all logic*

There are two paths to argue that the Creator transcends all logic. One is that logic is incomplete, it is impossible to make a logically consistent theory of all physical entities, and therefore physical entities and the universe at large transcend logic. Since the Creator created the universe, an entity that transcends logic, the Creator Himself must also transcend logic.



* *The Creator has a Will and is a Mind*

Since the Creator chose to create the universe, He is a Mind. (This is a bit of a weak argument for the Creator being a Mind, however).



* *Conclusion*

And so, and which has a Will and is a Mind. This entity is called God.



**God is Single and Indivisible**

It follows from the fact that God is the ultimate Creator and Sustainer that He is also single and indivisible. When talking about entities that have the ability to Create and Sustain, as there is no rational method of distinguishing one entity with these attributes from another entity with these same attributes. We can only rationally talk about the existence or non-existence of such an entity. Therefore, if we accept that God exists, we must accept Him as singular. This rules out polytheistic belief systems. Using the same reasoning, we cannot rationally make divisions within this single entity, which means that He is indivisible (this rules out many-in-one systems like the Trinity).

Just saw this on TIL.  So the Catholic Church admits that their moral compass was completely wrong during this scandal.  They blame society for dragging the Church off course.  Isn't it the Church's job to bring correct morals to society, and this is a crazy cop-out.

1328334007.0,pabzy,im just gonna be straight up and say it. i AmA christian that wants to debate religion with an atheist/agnositc. (but lets be civil),dtpheifer,34,11,297,"my personal ideal on christianity, to self control perseverence


 The first three are fundamental. Faith

I always interpreted this as the basic foundation of living a christian life.

Before you do anything else one must have faith. If you dont belive in what your doing there is no point. Faith is blindly following, but remember we christians arent perfect so dont let our hypocricy reflect our god.  

the second is virtue. once one has faith,  likewise having faith does not make one virtuous or moral. Many christians rely on the bible as a moral guideline only, when its a guidebook for living by gods covenant. Understand that every line in the bible has context when it comes to morality, but the world is not absolute so we must take into consideration the plight of the people in the world and respect there values and morals, when looking at our own. The least contested words in the bible are those of jesus, so when looking at virtue, read the red letters.

after that comes knowlege. if one doesn't try to seek out the real answers, listen to the serman and dont be afraid to speak to the pastor after. also after a serman, write down the bible quotes he/she uses, and look up there context. or ask him/her. the pastor is human, and he will have an opinion on any issue, but the bible is uncontestable for those that wish to live by gods covenent.  

 

self control is the next trial. one must know when to speak on accounts of faith virtue and knowlege, belive themselves to be pious, and have memorized the bible, they will be perseved as a pharasee, a hypocrite, and a poor example of the teachings of jesus christ. but if one controls there speech, and is not hastey to judge others for there opinions, rather than prideful and arrogant.

 after that comes perseverence

if you got that far, god will be with you. pray to him and try to learn what he is trying to teach you. if you are truely listening you will find gods answer. dont confuse this with falling away from god, although this is when most people would. if one has a strong foundation in there religious conviction they will pass there tribulation.

if they pass gods test, but rather god has smiled in there life, and have become blessed. but that blessing comes with a responsibity to shine god in a positive light. and god smiles when his christians are faithful, vitruous, wise, understanding and patient. (which are the qualities of godliness)

brotherly kindness comes after this. these are the peacemakers. For those that have the rare oportunity to experience godliness (which is not the same as grace, and turn the other cheek. they are peacemakers, who are the most blessed by god. but they are few and far between. if one truely is a peacemaker, they can truely change the world. (ghandi was so christian he was hindu -bill maher) (if all christians beliveled what they say they do, they would of already changed the world by now -mahatma ghandi). finally at the end of this, is love, when one truely has all these things that preceed love, for the better. (i wonder what my paster thinks of this)
