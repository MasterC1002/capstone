My own experience; some thieves specifically targeted foreigners for this reason(stash

Any public knowledge that your home holds lots of guns, safes, etc. and especially drugs is like a sign that says ""Come at me Bro"" to professional thieves. Unlike the usual stolen junk(electronics, cheap watches, trinkets) you will get fair market value for these already pricey goods.

After spending an honest 3 hours of googling for some sort of affordable smart-home system I could control with my iPhone, then remembered a well-reviewed [DIY system](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003MP93BW/ref=oh_o00_s00_i02_details) I had seen on Amazon and immediately realized they might work together, utilizing Google Voice.  

The Skylink system looked perfect and had solid enough reviews on Amazon for me to take the risk of connecting 3 separate pieces of technology... which usually ends up being a nightmare. However

Two days later, but is not capable of calling 911. Similar restrictions apply to other VOIP services and units like Magic Jack, but they are not free like GV. If you are already using Skype or other VOIP, however, you can skip the Obi100 and hook the Dial Alert right up to your current line. Skylink reiterated that ""all you need is a dialtone for the unit to work"" but I cannot attest to the accuracy of this statement, especially considering long-distance calls. GV will make US long-distance calls without issue, but I'm not sure about international.) 

The Skylink was a snap to set up as well. I started with the Dial Alert unit, and a few contacts. You can program up to 9 numbers, in order of importance, with each having the ability to cancel the alarm and stop the call from being kicked down to the next in line. (Skylink recommends not programming in emergency numbers, but it's easy enough for someone to hang up and dial 911, etc. after hearing your personal emergency message.) 

Once the Dial Alert was working, but have not set it up yet. The control unit sits by our front door and was surprisingly easy to program - with a slew of options for home mode, night mode, 4 different zones with unique traits, etc. We have the front door set to a 30 second delay while armed, allowing us easy entry and time to disarm the unit, but the back door will immediately sound the alarm and trigger the Dial Alert if the sensor is tripped. The system comes with a great selection to get you going (it even has a keychain remote) but you can add something like 30 peripherals at your leisure! 

I am very happy with the bang-for-buck combination and love knowing I will be alerted if my home is breached again - at no cost from here on out. No,False,self,t5_2sagj,True,,,t3_qw32y

1369611921.0,1f3vnm,Some of my thoughts regarding IP cameras; thought you guys might be interested.,minos16,45,9,28,"**reddit formating screwed up my post....will fix later**

My I.T. job assigned me some security camera install jobs and give me some really tight requirements on a tight budget(under $7k). They gave me time to experiment with quite a few brands, Axis, ACTi) and some low end garbage.

I had a few weeks to basically mess around with IP cameras and have a background in pro photography/video: Hopefully it helps some of you guys;

1. Hybrid IP/DVR versus IP/NVR; Unless you have some legacy cams lying around

2. Low end crap versus higher end stuff:

Keep in mind that most CCTV cameras are garbage compared to professional cam equipment right down to lenses. Your setup isn't going to put out HD TV show quality vids without dropping **massive** sums.

Many IP cams are unfortunately....Fully automatic with limited tweaking options. Some allow you to change the lens and adjust aperture

Basically

Many demo vids take place in VERY well lighted rooms or outside(day time): in regular room light even professional cameras struggle let alone the tiny sensors in those cheap $200 amazon sets. 

3. Lighting

Since most CCTV cams aren't.....good...at all; maximize their effectiveness via light

When a cam has ample light

Unless the room has alot of windows or tons of light; YOU need IR/LEDs. Cam quality takes a gigantic dive indoors without them on my units with $600-800+ price tags. You can manually make LED/IRs to add to those cameras powered by a battery(instructables!).

Yes


4. NVR server:

If your using those all-in-one setups then this is taken care of; otherwise.... 

Build your own. Unless your utterly incompetent with computers. It's just a PC running the camera software and recording. Some software allows you to record direct to a NAS bypassing the need for a stand alone NVR: could cut costs there.

5. Ultra-wide angle(3mm) lenses/cams are good for corners &amp; up-close; not much for anything else.

6. Software....all-in-ones probably come with software. Some software brands allow you to push processing to the camera or allow local storage recording(Axis). Others allow alot of alarm configuration and other settings. Some cam have free software and then a higher tier software with more options($$).

Some can notify you of motion via phone or email so you can log into live view when stuff hits the fan.

One gigantic benefit of custom camera software is mixing multiple brands.I don't need a $300-$800 camera for every room. Maybe just for the door and the rest are cheapo crap cams for evidence purposes. 

For example, and basically create my own motion alarm system to my exact specification. Freebie software might be lacking in similar options or dumb them down a lot.

7. Resolution;

Resolution DOES not determine image quality. It allows you to blow up a small portion of a image and maintain clarity/detail. Good for picking out tiny details like license plates across a parking lot.

A bad/cheap HD camera might be 2-8MP but the image quality is so bad that it looks like SD. However I'd avoid anything under 1 MP unless it's in a non-essential area. 1-3MP+ is the sweet spot for critical areas(doors) and big areas. For covering a whole parking lot/farm field with few cams....5MP to 10MP+ is good. Shell out the bucks though($1000 for each unit). 

8. Zoom:

Optical: actual lens can zoom in. Useful for some people...nice feature.

Digital zoom: Fake zoom....no different from using the magnifying button in photoshop or windows. It's not a ""real"" feature but marketers act like it is. 

PTZ: these cameras can pan/tilt/zoom.....useful if the cam software allows the cam to follow a target or if you like live view spying alot. Otherwise

A useful example is a PTZ cam that will zoom out normally but zoom in on any transaction at the cash register allowing you to pinpoint shady money counting much easier....optical zoom that is.

9. Placement:

IF a ton of light is behind the subject

Try to get a up-face shot instead of trying to tag a face from 20 feet away.

10. Wireless cameras.

Wireless cameras are like wireless speakers: Retarded beyond belief in most situations.

Many IP camera get their power via Ethernet(POE). If the data is sent wirelessly.....it still needs a power source. 

So take your pick: 1 cable for power/wireless data transmission(with bandwidth issues) or 1 data/power cable. Without a portable power pack(low capacity or $$) you need a cable either way.

If you don't want to run Ethernet cable through out a house but have plenty of outlets; wireless can make sense. Otherwise go with POE. 

11. Cheap all-in-one camera systems($200-$600):

I haven't tried a all-in-one

I think you'd have better luck taking advantage of Deterant methods such as software motion sensor alarms

Some older/cheap setups might not even notify you of motion detected at odd hours. Nicer setups can allow you to actually speak to the offender live from your phone or computer: ""Get the hell out of my house tweaker!!""

If I had a large property and needed to watch for poachers, service employees, many rooms, etc.....dump the samsung/foscam and buy some Platinum CCTV cams(good value) with a NVR.

Upgrade ability: Many of those all-in-one systems lack the ability to add tons of cameras or even process the video of additional streams. Likely can't add non-matching brand cameras.

In contrast to all-in-one systems:

More expensive to go with the stand alone BUT if you have the parts for an NVR lying around(POE switch

Feel free to pinpoint ANY mistakes.

So here's the situation:

I recently bought a little plot of land, just outside the city so it's quiet and we don't disturb anyone.

Now the problem is that there are other people using it like they own it and even vandalizing it. So far I have encountered the following things: the shed in the back is vandalized a little more each time I come

At first I tried being nice
Of course these signs just kept disappearing and nothing changed.

I considered my options and since this place has no electricity I figured the best I could do was just padlock the gate. Got myself a reasonably decent lock ([LINK](http://www.masterlock.eu/products/detail/Padlocks-Weathertough/ExcellPadlocks)) because I knew they were going to try and mess with it. This worked for a month or two. For a while there was no trespassing.

Skip ahead to a couple of weeks ago. I arrive to open my gate and notice somebody has tried to drill the lock open. But since they were barely able to chip the lock and it still worked I just chuckled. I was glad I bought a decent lock and thought that was the end of it.

Then there is today. I arrive and try to open my lock but my key won't go in. Turns out these bastards glued the lock shut!

So now I'm wondering what to do next.
I'm sure as hell not going to go without a lock again

Do you guys have any ideas?
Are there maybe padlocks that can't be sabotaged this way?
Other suggestions?

•	Ultimately

•	I was not prepared for this event. I have considered many ways to react to a threat. Not this one

•	Command presence - If you don’t got it… get it! Bluff if you have to.

•	Dogs rule! They probably saved me and my kids from something bad. They are the reason this guy left. Not me.

Feel free to correct me since I'm not a pro: this thread is a follow up to my other one:

------------

IF being used outside the home; get a highly visible unit with built-in IR lights for the backyard; external IR lights work better for lighting a scene if that option is available. (thanks alientity)! 

A night thief who sees the red IR lights of a camera is likely to just skip on the next house IMO. A nearly invisible camera isn't as an effective deterrent. EDIT: Soco pointed out some units have nearly invisible IR lights whereas others have easily visible IR lights on the cam. Sometimes they may purposely have a visible ""sensor"" or ""On"" light with invisible IR.
 
The camera doesn't have to be bold

Don't get a dome for outside(in the back) unless you want to be discrete....get something that will make a thief think ""I'm already on camera....screw it

----------

Analog Versus IP:

Go IP unless you have a legacy system....you might want to get an analog card for the server to use/interface non-IP cameras or Non-IP security devices(like a separate alarm buzzer or door system) if needed.

-----------

Power over Ethernet: this is your friend!! Even better....if your home is networked
-----------

Blue Iris: Good software and dirt cheap: Can't say I had any major issues although one cam would crash blue iris whenever the settings on that one camer changed. It can handle 15+ cams like a champ and now has Direct to disk recording. No client software option if you want to control blue iris on the same network from multiple locations(perhaps I'm wrong?). You can via the phone software or use the web interface on other PCs(which has limited controls.
Somebody please correct the above if wrong....I'm not a expert on Blue IRis!

-----------

If your intimidated by the thoughts of building a NAS

Many newer cams can actually do the server related functions onboard and just record data to any PC/NAS on the network(if it's on). So you could throw up 4 cameras and invidually set up each for motion tracking, recording, SMS/email notification, etc. as long as they're getting internet and power(and a place to dump the recordings).

You do sacrifice some abilities to accomplish this but if it's not critical then you could roll out a few cams fairly quick. Axis cams allows direct recording to a SDcard so you could bypass the PC/NAS entirely and review records solely through the web interface or software from any PC. Axis cams are pretty pricey though. Some cheaper brands have the ability though with SD card recording.

If I owned a little store

---------------

Foscams and their clones: Foscams suck....sorry....had to be said. For the price($60-ish) they aren't a bad deal: they do work although some functions work poorly. Spend the extra cash on something better. They do have the ability listed above for web server functions which is nice.

-------------

When it comes to phone streaming and configuration; some brands are easier than others to get working with third party streaming software like tinycam pro. Some proprietary phone/computer brand camera software won't add competitor cameras.

------

*** Have a issue with your camera getting the IP or firmware installs? Do a HARD reset on the physical unit. Factory default via software is not a substitute for this! I've had at least 4-5 units including a fresh RMA that needed a physical reset not software.  ***!!!

-----
Many cameras require a login to connect to a third party software like blue iris or the default web interface:

Default Usernames for many cameras:

root

admin

(none)

Default passwords for most cameras I tried are:

admin

password

12345

123456

(none)

If the camera is used
-------

SMS notification, and IR Lamps.

Microphones can also be set as triggers for alarms or SMS/email notification.

You can schedule alarms and change them either in camera or through your standalone server software. Scheduling is obviously a must. 
------------

Get a camera with IR lights or a separate IR lamp to make up for it...only expensive units seem to have decent ISO performance at night. Some units are practically pitch black.
----------


ADT from my observation seems to ring your house if something is detected before calling the police. You can get your camera server to ring you via the telephone depending on your detection parameters. I suppose it's possible to get your independent camera running an on-board webserver to do this as well. 

----------

Don't go nuts on 5MP+ cameras....many have bad FPS(frames per second) unless you spend quite a bit.

---------

10-15 FPS is fine for most of your needs. 5-7 FPS is pushing it. 2-3 is bad!! 20-30+ if you have tons of recording space. 

--------

If a camera is under $80 new

---------
**brands**

Dahua: is probably the best bang for your buck brand around(they are usually rebadged under other brands for more $$). Kinda hard to find in the USA....support might be lacking since they're primarily an OEM manufacturer without a significant USA presence. YMMV on support since I never experienced it myself. I liked the quality of these a lot so far.

Platinum CCTV: costs a little more than the higher end Dahua but has excellent support and the owner inspects each individual unit before shipping although they don't offer the same variety of IP cameras as Dahua. If you need help setting these up with blue Iris

Axis: has excellent support and good quality. Price is higher but it's reliable and has a lot of excellent features like the SD card recording.DONT drop the M-series...I've had two units break doing this....RMA took only 2 days!! I like the default free software....easy to configure the above mentioned web server and software for SD recordings.

Arecont is decent but scraps features in favor of size and higher MP in it's units: however areconts can be had cheaply used sometime. I wouldn't get a Arecont for home use but would for a daytime(or night with large IR lamp) wide area like say... a farm or parking lot since the 5-10MP can be useful there. Consider them specialty cameras....

Mobotix: never tried; heard good things.

Avtech: meh.....haven't tried much...website is a mess. I have an older crappy unit lying around so I'm a bit biased.

Rebadged Chinese: Quite a few brands are just rebadge of OEM cameras with small modifications made by the company or additional Quality testing and support. Qsee is usually rebadged Dahuas and the Costco brand used them as well at one point!

Avigilon: good but on the pricey side....rather wide selection but like Arecont

Acti: Good price

Sony/Toshiba/Panasonic/Samsung

Foscams and the clones: Unless budget is the most important factor, older ones AREN'T POE powered.


For $50-60 I'd buy a used IP camera of a better brand off ebay if cost is a factor per unit.

They tried to break-in 3 times

Now i have added some more security layers.   

* Alarm system

    I bought a wired end of life set for a very good price.

    In the set was included: 8 motion sensors, 2 keypads, 1 indoor sirene and 1 outdoor sirene
  
    [One of the keypads](http://i.imgur.com/R9XRA.jpg)

    [One of the motion sensors](http://i.imgur.com/w9nmO)

    [An extra sirene horn](http://i.imgur.com/JCLwl.jpg)

    I found 2 of these sirene horns at a second-hand market at 12 euro's for both


* Ip camera system
  
    To gain experience ""on the field"" i was assigned to a tutor electrician where i had to work for 8 weeks.

    Since most shops were replacing older IP camera's to mobotix ip camera's i could keep 2 replaced pieces

    [Acti ACM 3310 on a self made bracket](http://i.imgur.com/hYn38.jpg)

    [Vivotek IP7361](http://i.imgur.com/tIo3k.jpg) (in the back ground you can see the outdoor sirene and in front the PIR detector for floodlights)


    [The same Vivotek](http://i.imgur.com/HL1eX.jpg)
     
    I still have to do some cable managment to do for both and there are still 3 IP cameras incoming and again a 2 Vivotek IP7361 and a [Vivotek MD7560](http://i.imgur.com/q1M1z.jpg)

* Floodlights and IR illuminators
     
    IR illuminators are very important since the standard embedded camera IR illumination is not enough making them useless at night.

    [IR illuminator](http://i.imgur.com/WXueq.jpg)
     
    I still have to mount these and unfortunately i dont know the brand of it

    Floodlights scare burglars when they light up
    I did this because keeping them on all night long will consume a lot of energy thus increasing your power bill

    [One already mounted](http://i.imgur.com/flq4a.jpg)

    [3 more](http://i.imgur.com/jSVao.jpg)

* Security perimeter
     
     Chainlinks fences have the advantage that they are easily placed and are quite cheap

     We already had a chainlink fence with 1 line of barded wire on top and 2 at the bottom, it completely surrounds our yard.
      
     [Chainlink fence](http://i.imgur.com/7sXdg.jpg)

     I placed motion sensors just behind the fence (note: these in the pictures are temporary
      
     [Perimeter motion sensor](http://i.imgur.com/f05qq.jpg)

     [one of the wooden pole's ](http://i.imgur.com/7liZd.jpg)
 
     i am thinking of mounting a floodlight and/or a camera too on the pole.

     To see where motion is detected i am going to make a panel where a led will light up where the motion is detected.

    [Like this](http://i.imgur.com/8L9tt.jpg)
   (This is a control panel for model trains

* Software

      The software i use to record and manage my Ip camera's is Milestone

       Our garage doors and automatic front gate are managed with paxton

I think i mentioned all important thing i am going to do
The total price for all the devices and equipment was around 800-900 euro

(and sorry for my bad english im not a good english speaker/writer)

I'm redditing in my rented townhome in an older

Doorbell rings. What? I don't get unannounced visitors ever. My girlfriend isn't due home for another hour. I remove my .45 from my bag and put it in my waist band. Peephole reveals a late 40's early 50's black man standing on my porch. I open the door...leaving the screen door closed.

I'm going to try and use punctuation or lack of it to illustrate the flow of the convo...

Guy: Hey man my names [forgot it

Me: ok...

Guy: You ever lock yourself out your house before man?

He appeared to be somewhat poorly dressed... as in maybe a transient. Unkempt facial hair...

Me: [pause]....no...

I become aware at this moment that I've opened the door completely and he can see into my house....he can see the laptop on my dining room table and into my kitchen where the back door is. I don't notice if he's actually looking into my house. Just that he can...

Guy: Aight aight...say uh... you know where [street and street] is?

Me: yeah that's downtown man... [10 miles away]

Guy: Damn..... Aight thanks man I leave you alone now....

Me: Ok. [close door and lock it]

Look out the window... he's walking further down my street the opposite direction from where he said he lives...

Ok. So. I sit back down at my computer and start thinking about how 
random this seemed and how random he was acting

My thoughts started shifting to the conversation and everything I've laid out above

So, but admittedly have some basic prejudices like pretty much everyone... Saw that coming, right?

I carry a pistol legally for personal protection. Better to have it and not need it

My question is

Any thoughts?

TL/DR: Weird interaction at my front door is causing me to worry about my families personal safety... need advice.

**EDIT/UPDATE** 

I've contacted my landlord who manages several properties in the area. After listening to my initial description of this guy and how he'd asked me about being locked out of my place

So if it's the same guy, but he apparently is less apt to deal with males that answer the door...as in he's more adamant about asking for money when it's a female. This is hella shady. 

I'm going to remain on guard and am installing additional locks tonight.

Being a person that keeps nothing (except the aformentioned) of value, had made off with about 4 dollars and a starbucks gift card. Aware of the fact that I was in a suburban neighborhood, that police were en route looking for a possibly armed suspect, and that I was carrying a black assault weapon, I had decided to hold my position, repeating details of the man's appearance and heading to myself.


The police came, and I'm a few cups of coffee poorer.    

But. I can't help but to reflect on my instincts to confront the man in the interests of preventing the theft of a firearm, but what legal privilege is given to an owner to defend personal property that is parked on a public street?

So, etc.  The line was crossed the other night when they threw rocks at my house (breaking a window and storm door window), and climbing onto my rear deck and attempting to gain entry to my house.  So now I'm sufficiently pissed off and ready to spend some money to catch these little pricks.  I even know who's doing it, I just need proof.

That said, only a laptop.  We also don't have a very fast internet connection (DSL at ~3mbps), so uploading to the cloud is out as well.  So I'm thinking of going with wireless cameras, which would record to a DVR inside my house.  My house is pretty small, so the cameras would be within 20' of the DVR.

With that system in mind

So, based on these requirements?

Outdoor Cameras:

* The cameras would need to be IR
* What should I consider to be the minimum resolution I need?  I understand that I'm not going to get HD quality here
* Audio would be nice but resolution is more important.
* How are the wireless ones powered?  I imagine there's a transformer between the house 120VAC and the camera

The DVR:

* The DVR would need to record an endless loop, I'll know it quickly and save the video elsewhere.

* All I really have is a laptop for viewing the video.  How do you go about getting the video off of the DVR?  (Again

* Support for 4 cameras should be more than sufficient.  I only really need two

* A magnetic probe sensor that you bury

I understand that if you are aware that someone is trying to break into your house

The problem I have - what if I don't have any idea what that *sound* was? A thud

A good example - a few months ago at around 1 a.m. my wife and I were in bed on the third floor. We both woke up to the sound of a loud bang and the sound of something falling down the stairs to the basement. We listened for a few minutes and didn't hear anything else.

Going back to bed wasn't an option - we were afraid someone was inside or something had fallen downstairs. So, adrenaline surging. Turns out, a dry-erase board we had recently installed in the kitchen with 3M strips had fallen off the wall in the staircase and went tumbling down the stairs to the basement. 

Mystery solved

Obviously

We don't have the money for a pistol (or a security system - we're renting anyway) and we can't care for a dog - and I currently live far from my state of residence so buying another firearm is not ideal.

So right now I""m looking for a better alternative than a 90-year-old war relic **and/or** a better technique for dealing with things that go ""bump"" in the night.

On the first occasion, i fetched my remington 870 when i heard banging, bell ringing, and saw a strange car in the drive, but room mate V answered the door first, only to be pushed in on again.

I am scared that one day someone will break into our home and try to steal, kill, or do whatever to my family or home. The only defense and assurance I have that I can protect my family is with a weapon. I realize that there are many here who feel guns are a bad force, but for people like me, they are a great measure of security and relief of anxiety. While I may not be able to stop a 6'5"", buff man

While I do not feel anything will ever happen to my family

Please upvote, informed decision.

1338927956.0,umnfn,Update: Going to try out the Ubiquiti AirCams,russianbotnetlord,16,4,16,"The GOOD:

* $100/camera
* Semi-weatherproof
* PoE (Power Over Ethernet) means running only 1 cable
* TLS Encryption (HTTPS)
* Ping Watchdog
* Based on Linux
* Active forums and community
* Fairly wide-angle
* Mounting hardware seems pretty solid
* Can define [different zones](http://www.zoneminder.com/sites/zoneminder.com/files/Screenshot-Home%20-%20Zone%20-%20Mozilla%20Firefox.jpg) with independent sensitivity (since NVR software is based on ZoneMinder)

The BAD:

* No night vision.  No infrared.
* Not technically weatherproof
* Motion detection is dependent on the software running on your NVR.  The cameras have NO motion detection alert capability without this.
* NVR hardware not included.  Must use a dedicated PC
* NVR software is BUGGY.  Very much a resource hog.  They seem to be working on updating this.
* Web interface of cameras allows for a very rigid ONE ADMINISTRATOR and ONE READ-ONLY account.  I will experiment with SSHing into the cameras and using ""useradd"".
* Some settings cannot be managed or pushed centrally from the NVR which results in having to log into each camera separately to make certain changes.  Would be handy to push out firmware updates...
* Packet loss on the network causes image to be [distorted](http://forum.ubnt.com/showthread.php?t=53328).  This in turn trips motion alerts (if set) and causes false positives.

Other Notes:

* Cameras are INCREDIBLY light.  Feels a bit cheap.
* Make sure you update EVERYTHING after unboxing.  I experienced countless bugs running the firmware everything shipped with.

1) record to USB or SD type media

2) get a decent picture through a window

We need something we can move around between vacant apartments to get views that our permanent cameras don't to catch dumpers, etc..

We would fab up or use a tripod of some sort to hold the camera(s) and they would be placed set back from the window with the blinds canted to allow viewing out.

As far as I can tell

I also assume we need some sort of manual focus to avoid getting a really pretty shot of the window blinds.

Wired vs wireless isn't really a concern because we can drop cables wherever in a vacant unit.

Other than viewing distance

Lorex seems to make decent cameras at the price point we are looking at. Any specific ideas for their stuff or any other brands?

Is there something I've missed that makes this idea unfeasible?

I've had the system for about 2 months.  I just recently activated the monitoring, easy, and reliable to help keep my family and my stuff (my PC!) safe.  More importantly, it had to be contract free and cost effective.  SimpliSafe fits the bill pretty well.  

**Pricing:**  $15/mo monitoring, and an extra keychain remote it was only about $275.  You only get what you need.  
  
**Overview:**  SimpliSafe is pretty simple.  They send you wireless modules for whatever you order.  Entry sensors, which has held up just fine for over 2 months.  No falling sensors, even on doors.  Also, the batteries are already installed.  Besides the sensors, you get a pretty standard keypad, a keychain USB remote that is used to program the system, and the base station.  The base station houses the GSM radio and is really the ""brains"" of the thing.  It is the only part that plugs into power
  
**Setup:**  I had the whole thing setup in 15 minutes. From my wheelchair (broken ankle). It doesn't have anything fancy, voice alerts, etc.
Speaking of the ""Home"" and ""Away"" modes
The alarm on the base station isn't quite loud enough. If you do get this thing
I hid the base station behind the couch, really.  I'll try to find out about this and update.
Our base station is downstairs
    
**Monitoring:** Once you've got everything setup, they will not call you during this period if your alarm goes off.  You will however have to send them a test message to make sure the GSM is working.  You will see if it went through on the event log on their website, which logs all events and activity for you.  The next day after I did this, SimpliSafe gave me a ring to let me know the test signal went through fine and to make sure I didn't have any questions.  Very nice. The website also has an easy to download certificate to give to your home insurance peeps. 
  
**Smart Alerts:**  I signed up for these for an extra $5 a month.  They are really cool, activity, and/or error messages.  For instance, I only have Alarm and Error texting my phone, while all 3 are sent to my email where it just filters them and archives them.  My wife only gets Alarm messages.  The website is very easy to use to do this by the way.   
   
**TL:DR:** SimpliSafe is cheap and simple but performs exactly how they say.  I would order the additional alarm however

I am trying to prevent a break in through it.  Last year one of my neighbors had their house broken into by someone kicking in their front door.  This is no surprise as the houses in this neighborhood came with a kind of cheap doors and locks

I have taken two steps to try to enhance door security so far:
1. Added a custom build steel bar to the door frame with multiple 4"" wood screws going into the stud that accepts the deadbolt and door handle latch.
2. Added a much better deadbolt with a non-standard key type to prevent bump-key break ins or other lock picking attempts.  

Aside from general comments
1. How likely is it that an intruder might try to break that center stained glass to unlatch the door
2. The door is light weight and to my horror, can I attach a new door to this existing frame or do I have to buy the door+frame and redo the work I did installing that metal bar into my current frame?  That took a lot of chisel work is why I'm asking, I'd rather not do it again unless necessary but I will if I have to.

So please give me your arguments.

EDIT:
Thanks all, or think they're children are trustworthy when they aren't. That said, your comments about educating your kids are very well taken and are obvious in hindsight - in fact, I think that may be why I'm so worried about child safety is that my Dad taught me about gun safety when I was a kid and really put the fear of god in me on how easily something could go wrong if you mishandle them.

One thing missing from these arguments (and please just take this as some friendly advice on how to deal with liberal gun-fearing folk like me) is any hard data. It's easy to say ""if an intruder comes in to kill you with a gun, or that 5% of people with guns in the house end up actually ever using them for personal safety. You may disagree and say ""it only takes once"" but there always risks on the other side - that your kid ends up shooting himself, or you shoot yourself or a cop or your wife. E.g. if there was a real stat that said ""1% of gun owners end up stopping an intruder, but 5% of gun owners end up with a family member shot"" that kind of math just wouldn't pan out. Maybe the issue is so controversial that reliable statistics just aren't out there.

I live in a generally quiet neighborhood of crime

Shit is getting really strange

Thus, or simply buying some IP cameras and software.  I work in IT, and run a server etc in the house with storage I can use or dedicate to this.  I also know generally the source of the trouble so I'm not too concerned with super high resolution facial capabilities as I can track them back to the entrance, but I'm looking to get at least 4 cameras (8 would be better).  Most will be placed on my roof and I have a pipe running there for wires for my other antennas, but coax will be tight to fit through there. Cat5 is far easier, but wireless might even be ideal.  

I've read through the links on the side

Suggestions? Thanks in advance all.

Could anyone here ElI5 how fire safes work? And also if you have any recommendations on what's the best or how to find the best

I figure its something I'll have for a long time so I don't mind going a little high-end-- after all

Or if anyone has any other ides of safe places you can put vital documents so that there's a solid chance of them withstanding a fire (*besides* the internet or a hard drive-- I'm talking paper here)

**Update:**

Round-up of thread so far:

--I'm not concerned about theft here... just trying to get something DEFINITELY fireproof... waterproof would be a bonus.

--The best safe I've come across so far: [First Alert 2040F Water/Fire Media Safe](http://www.amazon.com/First-Alert-2040F-Water-Media/dp/B000GB0K8U/ref=sr_1_1?s=hi&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340908250&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=media+fire+safe)

--Possible alternative option? [Fire-proof bag (manufacturer link)](http://www.firepouch.com/) + [amazon link](http://www.amazon.com/Fire-Pouch-Resistant-Proof-Cash/dp/B003K7IM78/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1340907744&amp;sr=8-2&amp;keywords=fire+resistant+pouch)

--I'm not looking for something very big-- I think equivalent of a standard manilla envelope would suffice.

--Planning to use it for: paper docs, cheque book, spare cell phone, hard drive, flash drives or sd cards, and maybe a spare cable... basically the things I think I'd absolutely NEED if it looked like everything else was gone. FWIW the idea behind the spare cell phone isn't so much that I'd have a phone-- although there's that-- but I have an old htc that can take pics and save them to sd and I figure if I was ever dealing with destroyed property first thing I'd want is a camera-- and bonus, it can take notes and connect to wifi-- so even without a data plan I could still use it to call people (google voice) and email, etc. from anyplace with wifi.

--I don't really want to go over $200 but I have some wiggle  room.

--Interesting ideas so far:

* from [packer64](http://www.reddit.com/user/packer64): check actuary tables

* from everyone: get at least a thirty minute rating

* don't bother with big box stores (yea you guys are right about that)

I've lived in a 2 unit apartment/house (in an unfamiliar city) for 9 months now.  It has always felt ""safe"" to me.  The neighborhood is pretty quiet and the people around me are nice and keep to themselves.  I'm just outside of downtown (walking distance) which itself is somewhat low-income/worrisome to walk around if you are alone at night.

1st bad event - 
Just recently we had Winter Storm Alfred which knocked out half the power to Connecticut (my state).  The girl above me (who is a US Army Reserve active soldier) installed a portable generator after the storm for power.  Apparently

2nd Event - 
Yesterday, jewelry, Army gear, school books.  My car, which was right next to it, was unscathed - however I feel it has something to do with the fact that my car looks new and nice, and has a visible alarm.  Her truck was just slim-jimed open and had no alarm.  The cops said they might come back for more.

These two recent events have me doubting the neighborhood I live in, and the scotchguard window film.  I also have a dog but she's a cupcake (30 pound border collie), and i'm 26 so gun ownership is possible.

I just bought a 4 camera system with a DVR.

I'm trying to decide where the best place would be to position the cameras.

I have a single story house

I was thinking I would position the cameras as follows:

One watching my front door

One pointed out towards my driveway/street.  This one may be placed next to the one watching my front door.

The other two I could mount up high on the side of my house watching the 2 gates to the back yard.  Both gates are 6ft tall and I keep them both pad locked at all times.

Thoughts?  An alternative I thought to watching the gates was to watch the 2 rear doors of the house.

Concealment ideas?  Since it's a single story really my only choice if I want to monitor each door and even the street is to mount under the overhang of the roof.

My basic goal is to build an expandable system that will record foot and vehicle activity on the property to a local computer that I will check daily (no internet access available however). Some cameras will be located near buildings but others will have to be isolated in areas such as on a tree.

**Basic Setup Idea:**

1. Initially 3 outdoor cameras that can be concealed with a good enough quality that I can make out faces and license plates out to 30 or so meters. Motion sensing ability to trigger video recording would be a plus.

2. Wifi setup to avoid having to run additional cables. Most cameras would be within 20 meters of the base station but some may be placed out to 50 meters away.

3. A computer I’d build myself that would run the surveillance monitoring software and store the videos. 

I can handle the computer requirements myself. As far as monitoring software it looks like the open source iSpyconnect.com software would fulfill my needs. I am not looking to spend a whole bunch of money

The properly is well lit and there are no bushes up against the house.  There is a covered porch/sunroom thingy where we keep our bikes and recycle bin.

At that time, and everything is being run to a DVR/monitor in our mechanical room. It's not the most ideal situation, and the way the cable is being run to the TV's

However, and doesn't need to be run to the DVR. Just a simple, camera that broadcasts an image to an external monitor, or our small 26 inch TV in the kitchen. Majority of our family's time is spent in the kitchen/family room and so it would be ideal to be able to view who's at the front door without walking up to it, since it's all glass. The distance from the front door to the kitchen/family room is probably about 20-30 feet if that matters.

Any ideas??

**Edit** I probably should've added this in the post title, which records who enters the gate. Again though, as I mentioned above, we have no way of seeing in real time, who's coming through the gate unless we're in the mechanical room, which is upstairs. Not exactly convenient to run upstairs and check each time someone is at the gate. The gate is operated by a call box, which the person calls in on, and we can open the gate. Sometimes though, or pool cleaner calls at the gate. They'll open it for them, and the kitchen - both rooms have an LCD if that matters."

How hard would it be to install a non-monitored alarm system in my house?  And more importantly, it is more of a ""would be nice"" type of thing.  The reason i don't want it monitored is because I have a lot of neighbors on all sides of my house who will probably look to see what's going on long before the monitoring company would even call the cops, also I'm cheap and don't want another monthly bill, and I live in a pretty safe area so it's really not necessary (also i don't have a land phone line activated).

So far as my background which would help with this project: I have worked as a non-licensed electronics technician at a theme park (mainly fixed games, and lighting) a little over a decade ago, so I do have a decent understanding of electrical hook ups, etc.  I just don't have any experience hooking up alarms.

If anyone can point me where to buy a decent control panel for the system at a fair price and some other info it would be much appreciated!  Thanks.

To those TL;DR types, all 3 times it didn't even penetrate my winter wear. Alternate between 00 buck and slugs in your tube and keep it locked in a QR safe before you go to bed every night. If you have kids, get the idea of home defense with guns out of your mind unless you have a very thorough plan and weekly range time. Too many times people get their family killed/tortured/raped trying to play the role of hero because they bought a pistol and went to the range every 3-6 months. Now for the long part and my home security plan:

An overwhelming majority of break-ins occur during sleep hours by people with zero motivation to actually harm the people living in the home. Are you going to be able to wake up, aim, shoot in the time the person breaking in can get to you or a member of your family? Really time yourself and practice things like this. Have someone unexpectedly wake you up from a dead sleep in the middle of the night and run the clock. If you can't handily beat the clock in a groggy state of mind hands down then having a home defense weapon is a waste that increases your chances of something awful happening to your family or you in the event of a B&amp;E.

Your best home defense is having a plan. Exiting the house is job 1. Contingency plans need to be hiding places that can be accessed quickly and silently with a GPS located cell phone dialed to 911. Confrontation should be your last ditch effort

In my family whether it was fire, floods, there was always a plan we knew with any number of contingencies. We also practiced it monthly to make sure we knew what to do. My father would always quiz us, throwing the ever-present Mr. Murphy in to make us think fast and react fast. It's a trend I've continued, brought to the family I love now, and considered when setting up my home.

Here's my strategy and why:

I have a 1/5 acre lot in a closely built 1950s suburban neighborhood 1/4 mile to the downtown of my city. Police

My home is a bungalow with a dormer on the back of the house. My main floor is easily accessible with a glass door wall in the back and multiple windows large enough for a person to get through in a hurry. Solution: privacy fence to hide the door wall from sight of people casing the neighborhood. I keep my shades at the front of the house drawn 95% of the time to prevent visibility to the floorplan and what I have inside.  The biggest advantage you have in a break in is that it’s your house and they don't know where they're going. Anyways the glass door walls are very inviting targets since their locks suck and you can typically derail the whole door portion with minimal noise. If my house ever got broken into that would be the most likely point of entry for that and its isolation from any neighbors seeing the act. I also have steel core doors and overbuilt frames around the additional entrances.

Final deterrent step

If someone ignores the sign, dobies, rotts, mastiffs, terriers, etc. and I'll only have a Rhodesian Ridgeback personal protection dog for the rest of my life. They’re definitely not for inexperienced owners though) Once alerted my lady knows exactly where to go hide, her phone is bedside fully charged and programmed to GPS trace with 911 and she takes the 9mm Mk24 P226. If you've never been in my house before

So assume all this has failed, make a 180* turn, run down another alleyway of 10+ yards on the opposite side of the bungalow portion, and then try and find us in the bedroom/bathroom/library area.

During that time if the perp is still coming for us he's hurt/killed my dog and I've probable cause that my family and I are imminently threatened.  It's like a shooting gallery and my PDW is a Rem 870 tac with a couple toys on it. If perps are still moving and get to me I prefer bladed weapons to handguns for CQB.

Now the most important part, I'd rather be tried by twelve than carried by six.

If you bothered reading this you can tell I put a significant amount of thought and months of work into the setup of my home. I don't think someone should have to compromise on the subject of security and comfort. It is my castle

It also doesn't obey any of the timings set on it and the fact that the settings are on the body of the camera is worrisome to me anyway. This light causes my camera to record many times throughout the night which has caused us to largely ignore the recording notifications which is the opposite of what I want.

I have considered replacing this vivint camera with a proper outdoor camera, but was wondering if there is a better all in one solution for light and camera. I've done a little searching online and found a few, but no ratings or customer feedback.

Can anyone recommend a good solution here? If not a good light/camera combo, I can set a zone of the recordable area to record and a sensitivity threshold. Since mine is facing down my driveway which eventually hits the street, this is mandatory for a motion trigger. Ideally, I would like to record directly to a home server I have and have the ability to view these recordings online. If the second part doesn't exist, don't worry to much, I can write something in my spare time to do that.

It is probably worth noting that I do not currently have a DVR. Vivint's IP cameras record and store directly to their servers. I've been curious about intercepting that data since it goes through my router and storing it locally as well,False,self,t5_2sagj,False,,,t3_wg2if

the keypad panel is a dsc brand with some identifying number sticker on the board inside i'd rather not post publicly online if not needed to.  the box that accepts the sensors is unbranded but with another sticker on the board.  

the people i bought this place from are long out of state and it'd be hard to track them down to get the arm/disarm pin from them.  

the keypad panel also shows some zones as constantly lit so i'm presuming there are some faults in the system.

what i need to know is a way to reset it so i can program my own pin into is.  i'm fairly inclined with electronics so if it requires hardware jumping to do so

my google searching has failed me so if anybody on here works with alarm systems and can at least point me in the right direction of a technical manual of the sorts it'd be much appreciated.  i'd like to be able to not spend the money on calling a technician out and being charged something ridiculous for what might be a 10-15 minute job.

So what I'm looking for is a wireless system that has the following capabilities:

**Immediate needs:**

   - Wireless entry sensors 
       - 4 door
       - at least 6 window sensors initially
       - motion sensors are probably not a good idea as I have a cat and a dog (both &lt;30 lbs)
   - cellular dialing
   - INSTEON/X10/Zwave type connectivity 
   - 2 control panels
   - Glass breakage sensors would be nice

**Future Needs (gradual upgrading):**

   - 10 window sensors
   - keychain remotes
   - internet/app access/control
   - INSTEON/X10/Zwave or similar devices such as lighting and thermostatic controls

I'm on the fence with monitoring.  I think I'd be okay with self-monitoring - having the system set up to call me/my cell, but for the right options I'd consider a service.
