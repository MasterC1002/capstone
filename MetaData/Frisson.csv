Two Major Changes are Occurring: 

**1 - Descriptive titles are now mandatory**

**2 - Only self-posts are allowed.**

For all the ""karma doesn't mean anything"" talk around reddit

And let's be [100% clear about what /r/frisson is](http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/14rskg/psa_just_what_is_frisson_lets_clear_up_some/):

&gt; a sudden

If it doesn't give you *goosebumps*

Obviously

This isn't the place to dump instant gratification emotional response images. If you look at an image and say ""that hit me right in the feels"" - it doesn't belong in /r/frisson. If you think it's ""touching

**If and only if it gives you *frisson* does it belong here.**

--------------------

Descriptive Titles
-

Just like so many other subs

The first is to **label what kind of content it is**

* Text
* Music
* Video
* Image
* Thought
* Comic
* Meta

If it's a music video

Second Requirement for labeling your submission:

**Name the piece and credit it**

Then you can write your descriptor about the submission after it.

So

[\[music\][Mumford &amp; Sons ""The Cave""] The moment you realize that your band has made it 0:16](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yvG6UrRMFnk)

[\[image\][Neil Armstrong] teary eyed moments after walking on the moon](http://i.imgur.com/3LEuv.jpg)

---------------

Self-posts
-

Please share where you found your submission


------------------------------------
**tl;dr** - If you don't have [text], [image], [thought], [comic], or [meta] in the title of your posts, your submission will automatically be removed by the Auto-Moderator. If you don't put a descriptor in the submission specifying what the content title/subject/author is, a human moderator will remove the submission.

1363718573.0,1alx5s,[text] Wil Wheaton tells a story about a fan.,jdllama,706,91,55,"&gt;Appearing as a guest at a big convention like MegaCon is a lot of fun, signing. It’s listening and engaging and sharing moments and meeting hundreds of people in a relatively short amount of time, or I can’t pose for that picture

&gt;I suppose I could make it less mentally taxing if I just sat there and didn’t make an effort to engage people or treat them like human beings (and there are some folks who do exactly that), no humility, no gratitude, and while I’ve met him a few times (there are a few people who act like fans at conventions are simply meatbags attached to wallets) I won’t ever be him.

&gt;And I wouldn’t have it any other way. Because I was a fan at conventions long before I was a special guest, because I get to meet remarkable and inspiring people, and share in the mutual joy we have for Doctor Who, Tabletop gaming, Game of Thrones, Star Wars, Star Trek, hockey

&gt;This weekend, doctors, or programmers because they were inspired by Wesley Crusher. I met tons of women and a few men who told me that I was their first teenage crush. I met a lot of people, men and women, my age and younger, who thanked me for speaking out about depression and anxiety. I held a young woman’s hands while she cried because her anxiety was so intense and scary, and I promised her that she would be okay. I was moved by her bravery, from Star Trek to My Little Pony to LEGO to Star Wars

&gt;But there is one meeting that stands out, a young woman walked up to my table with her husband and her two children. She handed me a typed letter and told me that she knew she wouldn’t be able to get through what she wanted to say to me, and would I please read it.

&gt;I unfolded it, and her doctors told her that she would never walk again. She had a photo of me, though, that she took with her to physical therapy every day, and the therapists would hold it up for her and encourage her to walk toward it — toward me — while she recovered. She made a promise to herself, she said, that she would walk again some day, she would walk up to meet me. At the end of her letter

&gt;I looked up at her through tears, and put about fifteen feet between us. I held my arms open, and asked her to walk over to me. She began to cry, and slowly, confidently closed the distance between us. I embraced her, and we stood there for a minute, surrounded by thousands of people who had no idea what was going on

&gt;“I’m so proud of you, “and I am so honored.”

&gt;We wiped the tears away, “and I know you don’t get it, because she’s, like your mom? But you have to trust me: she is.”

&gt;The kids nodded, who said, “Mommy’s okay. Mommy’s okay.” That made me tear up again. Mommy was okay, and she is a remarkable woman who defied the odds and her doctors, and *walked* up to meet me. I’m still overwhelmed when I think about what that means, and how I was part of it.

I would love to have the skill with words to put it all down here

Hole played an amazing set.  It was an outoor venue, and I was actually very strongly affected by Kurt's suicide (Nevermind was the first album that *changed* me as a person just from hearing it).

I had blocked it out.  After seeing girls in newly purchased Nirvana shirts lining the halls of my high school

Well...things...they have a way of not staying buried.

As Hole played

All of a sudden

It ended with Courtney kicking all of the other band members off stage

She sang that song like Kurt was sitting there watching it.  It tore her APART coming out of her.  It really was like watching someone tear their own heart out and eat it on stage.

She ended the song a complete wreck

The crowd was *silent* except for sobs I could hear all around me.  I noticed I was crying in front of total strangers and didn't even care.

Before she left the stage, and she screamed this to the crowd:

DONT YOU

When I arrived at 2:30 a.m., wait a minute, then drive away.
But, I reasoned to myself. So I walked to the door and knocked. “Just a minute”, answered a frail, elderly voice.
 
After a long pause
By her side was a small nylon suitcase. The apartment looked as if no one had lived in it for years. All the furniture was covered with sheets.

There were no clocks on the walls
box filled with photos and glassware.

‘Would you carry my bag out to the car?’ she said. I took the suitcase to the cab

She took my arm and we walked slowly toward the curb.

She kept thanking me for my kindness. ‘It’s nothing’

‘Oh, she gave me an address and then asked, ‘Could you drive
through downtown?’

‘It’s not the shortest way

‘Oh

I looked in the rear-view mirror. Her eyes were glistening. ‘I don’t have any family left
‘What route would you like me to take?’ I asked.

For the next two hours

We drove through the neighborhood where she and her husband had lived when they were newlyweds She had me pull up in front of a furniture warehouse that had once been a ballroom where she had gone dancing as a girl.
Sometimes she’d ask me to slow in front of a particular building or corner and would sit staring into the darkness

As the first hint of sun was creasing the horizon
We drove in silence to the address she had given me. It was a low building

Two orderlies came out to the cab as soon as we pulled up. They were solicitous and intent

They must have been expecting her.

I opened the trunk and took the small suitcase to the door. The woman was already seated in a wheelchair.
‘How much do I owe you?’ She asked

‘Nothing

‘You have to make a living

‘There are other passengers

Almost without thinking

‘You gave an old woman a little moment of joy

I squeezed her hand

I didn’t pick up any more passengers that shift. I drove aimlessly lost in thought. For the rest of that day, or had honked once, then driven away?

On a quick review

We’re conditioned to think that our lives revolve around great moments.

But great moments often catch us unaware-beautifully wrapped in what others may consider a small one.""",,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1dy6zi/text_the_cab_ride_ill_never_forget/

I've noticed a trend lately regarding the content posted here. At the time of me writing this there are 12 posts on the front page of /r/frisson tagged as [music]

Now I'm not saying that music can't be frisson inducing, music taste varies enormously from person to person. The music that I find fit to belong in /r/frisson will most likely only appeal to a fraction of the subreddit readers.

Things like photographies, however, are not as split into genres as music and thus appeal to a broader public.

A clear example of this can be seen by looking at /top/. If you look at the most upvoted posts there is not a single music post on the front page (excluding the dude singing in an oil chamber). This shows an obvious pattern of what most people find to belong on /r/frisson.

Apparently when she was in high school she was very shy and unpopular and usually spent her lunch breaks in the library. Towards the end of the year a group of popular girls asked her to have lunch with them. She was shocked and and said no at first, they persisted and she eventually agreed. They got in one of the girls cars and drove off school property headed to a restaurant. As they were driving down the road dozens of cop cars whizzed past them.

after only working there three months i took a call from a trucker who had wrecked on the interstate and was flipped on his side. he was pinned by the steering colum and the lower part of his body was crushed (like mel gibsons wife in ""signs"".
usually when a wreck happens on the interstate we get bombarded with calls from everyone passing the vehicle. i happend to recieve that call from the man himself, and that he must have dosed off for a second. he told me that he was pinned in and that the bottom part of his body was numb. he hold me where he was from and about his family (at this point i was making small talk to keep him calm) he started talking about god and asked me to pray with him, he lead the prayer, asking for help and for gods will to be done. i kept him on the line while responders traveled to the scene. as a little time went by, he started to slurr his speach and he wasnt comprehending my questions anymore, my guess is that he was slowly bleeding out and his level of conciousness was lowering. eventually he stopped answering my questions at all, he had passed out. very shortly after, they would not have been able to save him. i was pretty much the last person to talk to this man alive
being a dispatcher

I remember, ""Well, I've had it with humanity.""

But I was wrong. I don't know what's going to be revealed to be behind all of this mayhem. One human insect or a poisonous mass of broken sociopaths. 

But here's what I DO know. If it's one person or a HUNDRED people, the wiring of a tiny sliver of the species gets snarled and they're pointed towards darkness. 

But the vast majority stands against that darkness and, more importantly, the damage they wreak. This is beyond religion or creed or nation. We would not be here if humanity were inherently evil. We'd have eaten ourselves alive long ago. 

So when you spot violence, hatred or ignorance, just look it in the eye and think, ""The good outnumber you, and we always will.""

The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.

From out of the shadow a red sword leaped flaming.

Glamdring glittered white in answer.

There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge

'You cannot pass!' he said.

With a bound the Balrog leaped full onto the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.

'He cannot stand alone!' cried Aragorn suddenly and ran back along the bridge. '*Elendil!*' he shouted. 'I am with you

'Gondor!' cried Boromir and leaped after him.

At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.

##Monday July 1

One week ago I left Hong Kong after it became clear that my freedom and safety were under threat for revealing the truth. My continued liberty has been owed to the efforts of friends new and old

On Thursday

This kind of deception from a world leader is not justice, not me, but those who would come after me.

For decades the United States of America has been one of the strongest defenders of the human right to seek asylum. Sadly, is now being rejected by the current government of my country. The Obama administration has now adopted the strategy of using citizenship as a weapon. Although I am convicted of nothing, it has unilaterally revoked my passport, leaving me a stateless person. Without any judicial order, the administration now seeks to stop me exercising a basic right. A right that belongs to everybody. The right to seek asylum.

In the end the Obama administration is not afraid of whistleblowers like me, or powerless. No, the Obama administration is afraid of you. It is afraid of an informed, angry public demanding the constitutional government it was promised — and it should be.

I am unbowed in my convictions and impressed at the efforts taken by so many.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Last Question by Isaac Asimov — © 1956

The last question was asked for the first time, 2061, at a time when humanity first stepped into the light. The question came about as a result of a five dollar bet over highballs, and it happened this way:

Alexander Adell and Bertram Lupov were two of the faithful attendants of Multivac. As well as any human beings could, flashing face — miles and miles of face — of that giant computer. They had at least a vague notion of the general plan of relays and circuits that had long since grown past the point where any single human could possibly have a firm grasp of the whole.

Multivac was self-adjusting and self-correcting. It had to be, adjusted questions to its needs and translated the answers that were issued. Certainly they, and all others like them, were fully entitled to share in the glory that was Multivac’s.

For decades, and Venus, but past that, Earth’s poor resources could not support the ships. Too much energy was needed for the long trips. Earth exploited its coal and uranium with increasing efficiency, but there was only so much of both.

But slowly Multivac learned enough to answer deeper questions more fundamentally, what had been theory, became fact.

The energy of the sun was stored, its fissioning uranium, and flipped the switch that connected all of it to a small station, one mile in diameter, circling the Earth at half the distance of the Moon. All Earth ran by invisible beams of sunpower.

Seven days had not sufficed to dim the glory of it and Adell and Lupov finally managed to escape from the public function, where portions of the mighty buried body of Multivac showed. Unattended, idling, sorting data with contented lazy clickings, Multivac, too, had earned its vacation and the boys appreciated that. They had no intention, of disturbing it.

They had brought a bottle with them

“It’s amazing when you think of it, watching the cubes of ice slur clumsily about. “All the energy we can possibly ever use for free. Enough energy, if we wanted to draw on it, to melt all Earth into a big drop of impure liquid iron, and still never miss the energy so used. All the energy we could ever use, forever and forever and forever.”

Lupov cocked his head sideways. He had a trick of doing that when he wanted to be contrary,” he said.

“Oh, Bert.”

“That’s not forever.”

“All right

Lupov put his fingers through his thinning hair as though to reassure himself that some was still left and sipped gently at his own drink. “Twenty billion years isn’t forever.”

“Will

“So would the coal and uranium.”

“All right, if you don’t believe me.”

“I don’t have to ask Multivac. I know that.”

“Then stop running down what Multivac’s done for us

“Who says it didn’t? What I say is that a sun won’t last forever. That’s all I’m saying. We’re safe for twenty billion years

There was silence for a while. Adell put his glass to his lips only occasionally

Then Lupov’s eyes snapped open. “You’re thinking we’ll switch to another sun when ours is done

“I’m not thinking.”

“Sure you are. You’re weak on logic, because he figured when one tree got wet through, he would just get under another one.”

“I get it, too.”

“Darn right they will, and it’ll all have an end when all the stars run down. Some run down faster than others. Hell, the giants won’t last a hundred million years. The sun will last twenty billion years and maybe the dwarfs will last a hundred billion for all the good they are. But just give us a trillion years and everything will be dark. Entropy has to increase to maximum, that’s all.”

“I know all about entropy

“The hell you do.”

“I know as much as you do.”

“Then you know everything’s got to run down someday.”

“All right. Who says they won’t?”

“You did

“It was Adell’s turn to be contrary. “Maybe we can build things up again someday

“Never.”

“Why not? Someday.”

“Never.”

“Ask Multivac.”

“You ask Multivac. I dare you. Five dollars says it can’t be done.”

Adell was just drunk enough to try, might have corresponded to this: Will mankind one day without the net expenditure of energy be able to restore the sun to its full youthfulness even after it had died of old age?

Or maybe it could be put more simply like this: How can the net amount of entropy of the universe be massively decreased?

Multivac fell dead and silent. The slow flashing of lights ceased

Then

“No bet

By next morning, had forgotten about the incident.

Jerrodd, the even powdering of stars gave way to the predominance of a single bright marble-disk, centered.

“That’s X-23

The little Jerrodettes, screaming, “We’ve reached X-23 — we’ve reached X-23 — we’ve —-”

“Quiet, Jerrodd?”

“What is there to be but sure?” asked Jerrodd

Jerrodd scarcely knew a thing about the thick rod of metal except that it was called a Microvac

Jerrodd and his family had only to wait and live in the comfortable residence quarters of the ship.

Someone had once told Jerrodd that the “ac” at the end of “Microvac” stood for “analog computer” in ancient English

Jerrodine’s eyes were moist as she watched the visiplate. “I can’t help it. I feel funny about leaving Earth.”

“Why for Pete’s sake?” demanded Jerrodd. “We had nothing there. We’ll have everything on X-23. You won’t be alone. You won’t be a pioneer. There are over a million people on the planet already. Good Lord

Then, it’s a lucky thing the computers worked out interstellar travel the way the race is growing.”

“I know

Jerrodette I said promptly

“I think so, tousling her hair.

It was a nice feeling to have a Microvac of your own and Jerrodd was glad he was part of his generation and no other. In his father’s youth, came refinement. In place of transistors had come molecular valves so that even the largest Planetary AC could be put into a space only half the volume of a spaceship.

Jerrodd felt uplifted

“So many stars, busy with her own thoughts. “I suppose families will be going out to new planets forever, the way we are now.”

“Not forever, but not for billions of years. Many billions. Even the stars run down, you know. Entropy must increase.”

“What’s entropy

“Entropy, you know, like your little walkie-talkie robot, remember?”

“Can’t you just put in a new power-unit

The stars are the power-units

Jerrodette I at once set up a howl. “Don’t let them

“Now look what you’ve done

“How was I to know it would frighten them?” Jerrodd whispered back.

“Ask the Microvac

“Go ahead

Jarrodd shrugged. “Now, he’ll tell us.”

He asked the Microvac

Jerrodd cupped the strip of thin cellufilm and said cheerfully

Jerrodine said

Jerrodd read the words on the cellufilm again before destroying it: INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

He shrugged and looked at the visiplate. X-23 was just ahead.

VJ-23X of Lameth stared into the black depths of the three-dimensional, I wonder, in being so concerned about the matter?”

MQ-17J of Nicron shook his head. “I think not. You know the Galaxy will be filled in five years at the present rate of expansion.”

Both seemed in their early twenties

“Still

“I wouldn’t consider any other kind of report. Stir them up a bit. We’ve got to stir them up.”

VJ-23X sighed. “Space is infinite. A hundred billion Galaxies are there for the taking. More.”

“A hundred billion is not infinite and it’s getting less infinite all the time. Consider! Twenty thousand years ago, interstellar travel became possible. It took mankind a million years to fill one small world and then only fifteen thousand years to fill the rest of the Galaxy. Now the population doubles every ten years –”

VJ-23X interrupted. “We can thank immortality for that.”

“Very well. Immortality exists and we have to take it into account. I admit it has its seamy side, it has undone all its other solutions.”

“Yet you wouldn’t want to abandon life

“Not at all, “Not yet. I’m by no means old enough. How old are you?”

“Two hundred twenty-three. And you?”

“I’m still under two hundred. –But to get back to my point. Population doubles every ten years. Once this Galaxy is filled, we’ll have filled a thousand Galaxies. In a thousand years, a million Galaxies. In ten thousand years, the entire known Universe. Then what?”

VJ-23X said

“A very good point. Already

“Most of it’s wasted. After all

“Granted

“We’ll just have to build new stars out of interstellar gas.”

“Or out of dissipated heat?” asked MQ-17J

“There may be some way to reverse entropy. We ought to ask the Galactic AC.”

VJ-23X was not really serious

“I’ve half a mind to

He stared somberly at his small AC-contact. It was only two inches cubed and nothing in itself

MQ-17J paused to wonder if someday in his immortal life he would get to see the Galactic AC. It was on a little world of its own

MQ-17J asked suddenly of his AC-contact

VJ-23X looked startled and said at once, I didn’t really mean to have you ask that.”

“Why not?”

“We both know entropy can’t be reversed. You can’t turn smoke and ash back into a tree.”

“Do you have trees on your world?” asked MQ-17J.

The sound of the Galactic AC startled them into silence. Its voice came thin and beautiful out of the small AC-contact on the desk. It said: THERE IS INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.

VJ-23X said

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The two men thereupon returned to the question of the report they were to make to the Galactic Council.
Zee Prime’s mind spanned the new Galaxy with a faint interest in the countless twists of stars that powdered it. He had never seen this one before. Would he ever see them all? So many of them, in space.

Minds, but what matter? There was little room in the Universe for new individuals.

Zee Prime was roused out of his reverie upon coming across the wispy tendrils of another mind.

“I am Zee Prime

“I am Dee Sub Wun. Your Galaxy?”

“We call it only the Galaxy. And you?”

“We call ours the same. All men call their Galaxy their Galaxy and nothing more. Why not?”

“True. Since all Galaxies are the same.”

“Not all Galaxies. On one particular Galaxy the race of man must have originated. That makes it different.”

Zee Prime said

“I cannot say. The Universal AC would know.”

“Shall we ask him? I am suddenly curious.”

Zee Prime’s perceptions broadened until the Galaxies themselves shrunk and became a new, all carrying their load of intelligences with minds that drifted freely through space. And yet one of them was unique among them all in being the originals Galaxy. One of them had, in its vague and distant past, a period when it was the only Galaxy populated by man.

Zee Prime was consumed with curiosity to see this Galaxy and called

The Universal AC heard, and each receptor lead through hyperspace to some unknown point where the Universal AC kept itself aloof.

Zee Prime knew of only one man whose thoughts had penetrated within sensing distance of Universal AC, difficult to see.

“But how can that be all of Universal AC?” Zee Prime had asked.

“Most of it

Nor could anyone, when any man had any part of the making of a universal AC. Each Universal AC designed and constructed its successor. Each, during its existence of a million years or more accumulated the necessary data to build a better and more intricate, more capable successor in which its own store of data and individuality would be submerged.

The Universal AC interrupted Zee Prime’s wandering thoughts

A thought came

But it was the same after all

Dee Sub Wun, “And is one of these stars the original star of Man?”

The Universal AC said

“Did the men upon it die?” asked Zee Prime

The Universal AC said, WAS CONSTRUCTED FOR THEIR PHYSICAL BODIES IN TIME.”

“Yes, but a sense of loss overwhelmed him even so. His mind released its hold on the original Galaxy of Man, let it spring back and lose itself among the blurred pin points. He never wanted to see it again.

Dee Sub Wun said

“The stars are dying. The original star is dead.”

“They must all die. Why not?”

“But when all energy is gone

“It will take billions of years.”

“I do not wish it to happen even after billions of years. Universal AC! How may stars be kept from dying?”

Dee sub Wun said in amusement

And the Universal AC answered. “THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”

Zee Prime’s thoughts fled back to his own Galaxy. He gave no further thought to Dee Sub Wun

Unhappily

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Man considered with himself, mentally, was one. He consisted of a trillion, trillion, trillion ageless bodies, each in its place, each resting quiet and incorruptible, equally incorruptible

Man said

Man looked about at the dimming Galaxies. The giant stars, back in the dimmest of the dim far past. Almost all stars were white dwarfs, fading to the end.

New stars had been built of the dust between the stars, and those were going, too. White dwarfs might yet be crashed together and of the mighty forces so released, new stars built, but only one star for every thousand white dwarfs destroyed, and those would come to an end, too.

Man said, the energy that is even yet left in all the Universe will last for billions of years.”

“But even so, however stretched out, the energy once expended is gone and cannot be restored. Entropy must increase to the maximum.”

Man said

The Cosmic AC surrounded them but not in space. Not a fragment of it was in space. It was in hyperspace and made of something that was neither matter nor energy. The question of its size and Nature no longer had meaning to any terms that Man could comprehend.

“Cosmic AC

The Cosmic AC said

Man said

The Cosmic AC said

“Will there come a time

The Cosmic AC said

Man said

“THERE IS AS YET INSUFFICIENT DATA FOR A MEANINGFUL ANSWER.”

“Will you keep working on it?” asked Man.

The Cosmic AC said

Man said

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The stars and Galaxies died and snuffed out

One by one Man fused with AC

Man’s last mind paused before fusion, asymptotically, to the absolute zero.

Man said

AC said

Man’s last mind fused and only AC existed — and that in hyperspace.
Matter and energy had ended and with it

All other questions had been answered

All collected data had come to a final end. Nothing was left to be collected.

But all collected data had yet to be completely correlated and put together in all possible relationships.

A timeless interval was spent in doing that.

And it came to pass that AC learned how to reverse the direction of entropy.

But there was now no man to whom AC might give the answer of the last question. No matter. The answer — by demonstration — would take care of that

For another timeless interval

The consciousness of AC encompassed all of what had once been a Universe and brooded over what was now Chaos. Step by step

And AC said

And there was light –

Missed Connection - m4w


I saw you on the Manhattan-bound Brooklyn Q train. 


I was wearing a blue-striped t-shirt and a pair of maroon pants. You were wearing a vintage red skirt and a smart white blouse. We both wore glasses. I guess we still do.


You got on at DeKalb and sat across from me and we made eye contact


Several times we looked at each other and then looked away. I tried to think of something to say to you -- maybe pretend I didn't know where I was going and ask you for directions or say something nice about your boot-shaped earrings


At one point


My stop was Union Square, but then I didn't get off at 42nd Street either. You must have missed your stop as well, because when we got all the way to the end of the line at Ditmars, we both just sat there in the car, waiting.


I cocked my head at you inquisitively. You shrugged and held up your book as if that was the reason.


Still I said nothing.


We took the train all the way back down -- down through Astoria, from Times Square to Herald Square to Union Square, under SoHo and Chinatown, up across the bridge back into Brooklyn, past Barclays and Prospect Park, past Flatbush and Midwood and Sheepshead Bay, all the way to Coney Island. And when we got to Coney Island


Still I said nothing.


And so we went back up.


Up and down the Q line


For months we sat on the train saying nothing to each other. We survived on bags of skittles sold to us by kids raising money for their basketball teams. We must have heard a million mariachi bands


I'll talk to her before daybreak; I'll talk to her before Tuesday. The longer I waited, I could have said, ""Well, this is inconvenient,"" but I couldn't very well say it now, could I? I would kick myself for days after every time you sneezed -- why hadn't I said ""Bless You""? That tiny gesture could have been enough to pivot us into a conversation, but here in stupid silence still we sat.


There were nights when we were the only two souls in the car, I thought, she doesn't want to talk to me. Still, there were moments when I felt a connection. Someone would shout something crazy about Jesus and we'd immediately look at each other to register our reactions. A couple of teenagers would exit, holding hands, and we'd both think: Young Love.


For sixty years, if only peripherally. I memorized the folds of your body, the contours of your face, the patterns of your breath. I saw you cry once after you'd glanced at a neighbor's newspaper. I wondered if you were crying about something specific, or just the general passage of time, so unnoticeable until suddenly noticeable. I wanted to comfort you, wrap my arms around you, but it felt too familiar; I stayed glued to my seat.


One day, this simple task of standing up, you hadn't done it in sixty years. Holding onto the rails, you managed to get yourself to the door. You hesitated briefly there, perhaps waiting for me to say something, giving me one last chance to stop you, but rather than spit out a lifetime of suppressed almost-conversations I said nothing


It took me a few more stops before I realized you were really gone. I kept waiting for you to reenter the subway car


When the train returned to Queensboro Plaza, still waiting. Perhaps I would see you, smiling and bright, your long gray hair waving in the wind from the oncoming train.


But no


I stayed on the train until it got to Union Square,False,,t5_2smzw,False,,,t3_1jx8ew

1374859085.0,1j3w7s,[Text] You should date an illiterate girl,GridGazelle,507,281,166,"You should date an illiterate girl.

Date a girl who doesn't read. Find her in the weary squalor of a Midwestern bar. Find her in the smoke, find her smiling. Make sure that it lingers when the people that are talking to her look away. Engage her with unsentimental trivialities. Use pick-up lines and laugh inwardly. Take her outside when the night overstays its welcome. Ignore the palpable weight of fatigue. Kiss her in the rain under the weak glow of a streetlamp because you’ve seen it in a film. Remark at its lack of significance. Take her to your apartment. Dispatch with making love. Fuck her.

Let the anxious contract you've unwittingly written evolve slowly and uncomfortably into a relationship. Find shared interests and common ground like sushi and folk music. Build an impenetrable bastion upon that ground. Make it sacred. Retreat into it every time the air gets stale or the evenings too long. Talk about nothing of significance. Do little thinking. Let the months pass unnoticed. Ask her to move in. Let her decorate. Get into fights about inconsequential things like how the fucking shower curtain needs to be closed so that it doesn't fucking collect mold. Let a year pass unnoticed. Begin to notice.

Figure that you should probably get married because you will have wasted a lot of time otherwise. Take her to dinner on the forty-fifth floor at a restaurant far beyond your means. Make sure there is a beautiful view of the city. Sheepishly ask a waiter to bring her a glass of champagne with a modest ring in it. When she notices, let it stagnate. If she cries, smile as if you’ve never been happier. If she doesn't, smile all the same.

Let the years pass unnoticed. Get a career, during walks, as if you might never return or as if you might blow away on the wind. Contract a terminal illness. Die, but only after you observe that the girl who didn't read never made your heart oscillate with any significant passion, that no one will write the story of your lives, and that she will die, too

Do those things, I say, because a life in purgatory is better than a life in hell. Do it, because a girl who reads possesses a vocabulary that can describe that amorphous discontent of a life unfulfilled—a vocabulary that parses the innate beauty of the world and makes it an accessible necessity instead of an alien wonder. A girl who reads lays claim to a vocabulary that distinguishes between the specious and soulless rhetoric of someone who cannot love her, and the inarticulate desperation of someone who loves her too much. A vocabulary, goddamnit, that makes my vacuous sophistry a cheap trick.

Do it, that the ebb comes along with the flow of disappointment. A girl who has read up on her syntax senses the irregular pauses—the hesitation of breath—endemic to a lie. A girl who reads perceives the difference between a parenthetical moment of anger and the entrenched habits of someone whose bitter cynicism will run on, run on well past any point of reason, or purpose, run on far after she has packed a suitcase and said a reluctant goodbye and she has decided that I am an ellipsis and not a period and run on and run on. Syntax that knows the rhythm and cadence of a life well lived.

Date a girl who doesn't read because the girl who reads knows the importance of plot. She can trace out the demarcations of a prologue and the sharp ridges of a climax. She feels them in her skin. The girl who reads will be patient with an intermission and expedite a denouement. But of all things

Don’t date a girl who reads because girls who read are storytellers. You with the Joyce, on the platform of the metro, you in the corner of the café, you in the window of your room. You, who make my life so goddamned difficult. The girl who reads has spun out the account of her life and it is bursting with meaning. She insists that her narratives are rich, her supporting cast colorful, and her typeface bold. You, make me want to be everything that I am not. But I am weak and I will fail you, and perfection, stay and save my life.

 “This is a slightly unusual request, it’s the first time anyone’s been asked to supply a Tibetan monastery with an Automatic Sequence Computer. I don’t wish to be inquisitive, but I should hardly have thought that your — ah — establishment had much use for such a machine. Could you explain just what you intend to do with it?”

“Gladly, for our work we are interested in letters, not numbers. As we wish you to modify the output circuits, the machine will be printing words, not columns of figures.”

“I don’t quite understand....”

“This is a project on which we have been working for the last three centuries — since the lamasery was founded

“Naturally.”

“It is really quite simple. We have been compiling a list which shall contain all the possible names of God.”

“I beg your pardon?”

“We have reason to believe

“And you have been doing this for three centuries?”

“Yes: we expected it would take us about fifteen thousand years to complete the task.”

“Oh

The lama hesitated for a fraction of a second

“Call it ritual, Jehovah, Allah, and so on — they are only man-made labels. There is a philosophical problem of some difficulty here, which I do not propose to discuss, but somewhere among all the possible combinations of letters that can occur are what one may call the real names of God. By systematic permutation of letters, we have been trying to list them all.”

“I see. You’ve been starting at AAAAAAA... and working up to ZZZZZZZZ....”

“Exactly — though we use a special alphabet of our own. Modifying the electromatic typewriters to deal with this is, no letter must occur more than three times in succession.”

“Three? Surely you mean two.”

“Three is correct: I am afraid it would take too long to explain why

“I’m sure it would

“Luckily

Dr. Wagner was scarcely conscious of the faint sounds from the Manhattan streets far below. He was in a different world, mountains. High up in their remote aeries these monks had been patiently at work, generation after generation, compiling their lists of meaningless words. Was there any limit to the follies of mankind? Still, he must give no hint of his inner thoughts. The customer was always right....

“There’s no doubt, in these days, is not going to be easy.”

“We can arrange that. The components are small enough to travel by air — that is one reason why we chose your machine. If you can get them to India

“And you want to hire two of our engineers?”

“Yes

“I’ve no doubt that Personnel can manage that.” Dr. Wagner scribbled a note on his desk pad. “There are just two other points —”

Before he could finish the sentence the lama had produced a small slip of paper.

“This is my certified credit balance at the Asiatic Bank.”

“Thank you. It appears to be — ah — adequate. The second matter is so trivial that I hesitate to mention it — but it’s surprising how often the obvious gets overlooked. What source of electrical energy have you?”

“A diesel generator providing fifty kilowatts at a hundred and ten volts. It was installed about five years ago and is quite reliable. It’s made life at the lamasery much more comfortable

“Of course

The view from the parapet was vertiginous

This,” some wit back at the labs had christened it. For weeks now the Mark V had been churning out acres of sheets covered with gibberish. Patiently, inexorably, the computer had been rearranging letters in all their possible combinations, exhausting each class before going on to the next. As the sheets had emerged from the electromatic typewriters, the monks had carefully cut them up and pasted them into enormous books.

In another week, twenty, or a hundred letters, George didn’t know. One of his recurring nightmares was that there would be some change of plan, and that the high lama (whom they’d naturally called Sam Jaffe, though he didn’t look a bit like him) would suddenly announce that the project would be extended to approximately A.D. 2060. They were quite capable of it.

George heard the heavy wooden door slam in the wind as Chuck came out onto the parapet beside him. As usual, were quite willing to embrace all the minor and most of the major pleasures of life. That was one thing in their favor: they might be crazy, but they weren’t bluenoses. Those frequent trips they took down to the village, for instance...

“Listen

“What’s wrong? Isn’t the machine behaving?” That was the worst contingency George could imagine. It might delay his return

“No — it’s nothing like that.” Chuck settled himself on the parapet

What d’ya mean? I thought we knew.”

“Sure — we know what the monks are trying to do. But we didn’t know why. It’s the craziest thing—”

“Tell me something new

“— but old Sam’s just come clean with me. You know the way he drops in every afternoon to watch the sheets roll out. Well, in that cute English accent of his, if I’d ever wondered what they were trying to do. I said, ‘Sure’ — and he told me.”

“Go on: I’ll buy it.”

“Well, the very idea is something like blasphemy.”

“Then what do they expect us to do? Commit suicide?”

“There’s no need for that. When the list’s completed

“Oh

Chuck gave a nervous little laugh.

“That’s just what I said to Sam. And do you know what happened? He looked at me in a very queer way, ’It’s nothing as trivial as that.’ ”

George thought this over a moment.

“That’s what I call taking the Wide View

“Yes — but don’t you see what may happen? When the list’s complete and the Last Trump doesn’t blow — or whatever it is they expect — we may get the blame. It’s our machine they’ve been using. I don’t like the situation one little bit.”

“I see, they didn’t turn nasty, as you’d expect. They just decided that he’d made a mistake in his calculations and went right on believing. I guess some of them still do.”

“Well, and I’ll be sorry for old Sam when his lifework backfires on him. But all the same, I wish I was somewhere else.”

“I’ve been wishing that for weeks. But there’s nothing we can do until the contract’s finished and the transport arrives to fly us out.

“Like hell we could! That would make things worse.”

“Not the way I meant. Look at it like this. The machine will finish its run four days from now, but not too quickly. If we time matters properly, we can be down at the airfield when the last name pops out of the register. They won’t be able to catch us then.”

“I don’t like it, I’ll sit tight and take what comes.”

""I still don’t like it, as the tough little mountain ponies carried them down the winding road. “And don’t you think I’m running away because I’m afraid. I’m just sorry for those poor old guys up there, and I don’t want to be around when they find what suckers they’ve been. Wonder how Sam will take it?” “It’s funny,” replied Chuck, “but when I said good-by I got the idea he knew we were walking out on him — and that he didn’t care because he knew the machine was running smoothly and that the job would soon be finished. After that — well, of course, for him there just isn’t any After That....”

George turned in his saddle and stared back up the mountain road. This was the last place from which one could get a clear view of the lamasery. The squat, of course, sharing the same circuit as the Mark V. How much longer would they share it? wondered George. Would the monks smash up the computer in their rage and disappointment? Or would they just sit down quietly and begin their calculations all over again?”

He knew exactly what was happening up on the mountain at this very moment. The high lama and his assistants would be sitting in their silk robes, for the Mark V itself was utterly silent as it flashed through its thousands of calculations a second. Three months of this, thought George, was enough to start anyone climbing up the wall.

“There she is!” called Chuck

She certainly was

The swift night of the high Himalayas was now almost upon them. Fortunately, and they were both carrying torches. There was not the slightest danger, only a certain discomfort from the bitter cold. The sky overhead was perfectly clear, and ablaze with the familiar, friendly stars. At least there would be no risk, thought George, of the pilot being unable to take off because of weather conditions. That had been his only remaining worry.

He began to sing, did not encourage such ebullience. Presently George glanced at his watch.

“Should be there in an hour

Chuck didn’t reply

**My Darling Wife**

This note is to warn you of a diabolical plot entered into by some of our so called friends — (ha!) calendar makers and even our own children. These and others would have you believe we've been married 20 years.

20 minutes maybe — but never 20 years. In the first place it is a known fact that a human cannot sustain the high level of happiness I feel for more than a few minutes — and my happiness keeps increasing. 

I will confess to one puzzlement but I'm sure it is just some trick perpetrated by our friends — (Ha again!) I can't remember ever being without you and I know I was born more than 20 mins ago.

Oh well — that isn't important. The important thing is I don't want to be without you for the next 20 years

* Isn't it funny how day by day nothing changes but

* When I became a man I put away childish things

* All mortals tend to turn into the thing they are pretending to be. 

* It is the magician's bargain: give up our soul, ourselves, have been given up, the power thus conferred will not belong to us. We shall in fact be the slaves and puppets of that to which we have given our souls.

* [Mortals] say of some temporal suffering, once attained, will work backwards and turn even that agony into a glory. And of some sinful pleasure they say ""Let me have but this and I'll take the consequences"": little dreaming how damnation will spread back and back into their past and contaminate the pleasure of the sin. Both processes begin even before death.

* There have been men before … who got so interested in proving the existence of God that they came to care nothing for God himself… as if the good Lord had nothing to do but to exist. There have been some who were so preoccupied with spreading Christianity that they never gave a thought to Christ.

* To love at all is to be vulnerable. Love anything, not even to an animal. Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or coffin of your selfishness. But in that casket — safe, dark, motionless, airless — it will change. It will not be broken; it will become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable. The alternative to tragedy, is damnation. The only place outside of Heaven where you can be perfectly safe from all the dangers and perturbations of love is Hell. [Bonus Comic](http://zenpencils.com/comic/103-c-s-lewis-to-love-at-all/)

* Friendship is unnecessary, like the universe itself (for God did not need to create). It has no survival value; rather it is one of those things which give value to survival.

* It's so much easier to pray for a bore than to go and see one.

* Her (his recently deceased wife) absence is no more emphatic in those places than anywhere else. It's not local at all. I suppose if one were forbidden all salt one wouldn't notice it much more in any one food more than another. Eating in general would be different, spread over everything.

* I want to have her back as an ingredient in the restoration of my past. Could I have wished her anything worse? Having got once through death, have all her dying to do all over again? They call Stephen the first martyr. Hadn't Lazarus the rawer deal?

* (on Lord of the Rings) 'But why, if you have a serious comment to make on the real life of men, must you do it by talking about a phantasmagoric never-never land of your own?' Because, I take it, one of the main things the author wants to say is that the real life of men is of that mythical and heroic quality. One can see the principle at work in his characterization. Much that in a realistic work would be done by 'character delineation' is here done simply by making the character an elf, a dwarf, or a hobbit. The imagined beings have their insides on the outside; they are visible souls. And man as a whole, have we seen him at all till we see that he is like a hero in a fairy tale? ",t5_2smzw,True

1322695579.0,mvcsv,Im tired of this sub-reddit becoming all music posts... Here are my absolute favorite scenes of pure frisson from some of my favorite films.,JackHorner_Filmmaker,208,17,46,"**PLEASE KEEP IN MIND THAT SOME OF THESE SCENES ARE SPOILERS
**

Here are just a few of my favorites.  Feel free to add your own favorites and lets start making this sub-reddit more diverse!!!

**Jurassic Park** (1993): Speilberg reinvented the summer movie with this one.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJlmYh27MHg) scene changed my life and singlehandedly made me want to be a filmmaker.Sadly what we didnt know was it would be the last of the actually intellectually fascinating blockbusters until...

**The Lord of the Rings** (2001-2003):  Really

**Pleasantville** (1998):  Another movie that induces frisson throughout.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrCH-W8_fA8) scene though is the standout.  A film about the death of innocence

**Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind** (2004):  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/user/movieclips#p/search/0/Sy7YnrVXudg) is the emotional climax of the memory section of the film.  If you haven't seen the film this scene wont make any sense but sufice it to say the film might be the greatest film of the past decade so go see it.  

**The Truman Show** (1998): The whole [END SCENE](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-1LM7Q3Hqi4) of the film is breathtaking.  A film that challenges viewers to break out of their sheltered lives and see the world for what it truly is.  Serious Jim Carrey is the best kind of Jim Carrey.

**2001: A Space Odyssey** (1968): What can I say except

**Almost Famous** (1999): Possibly the defining scene of 1990's cinema.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHH3FoJUEbg) scene illustrates the power of music to bring people together

**Jerry Maguire** (1995): Cameron Crowe is a master of Frisson.  Everyone knows about the ""You complete me"" scene but [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQeMyr9jnQ0&amp;feature=related) is the true frisson filled scene for me.  It really kicks into gear around 2:30.

**Cool Runnings** (1993):  Its cheesy as all hell but if [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=31M_MdSVxV8)  doesn't raise the hairs on the back of your neck and make you shed a tear


*EDIT*:  I had planned on making this a lot longer before so now that I have a bit more free time this morning Im adding some more favorites.  

**Road to Perdition** (2002):  One of the most beautiful shootouts put to film in my opinion.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZphC0_XpDp4) is why Im excited that Sam Mendes is directing the new 007 film.

**Moon** (2009):  Sam Rockwell coping with the fact that he is a clone is some of the best acting in the last few years.  Do yourself a favor and see this flick.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2C_VGqSaBgM) is my favorite scene.

**(500) Days of Summer** (2009): Unfortunately I wasn't able to find a clip of the full scene but [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-xJ15AN9ts) gives you an idea of what Im getting at.  The trully frisson filled moments are after this video ends sadly.  Go check out this movie if you haven't already.

**Oceans 11** (2001):  Its almost cheating to use Claire de Lune to induce frisson but regardless

**There Will Be Blood** (2007): Daniel Day Lewis doesnt even need music to help induce frisson.  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEeA7BdjteM) is one of the greatest performances of all time and one of the best acted scenes of all time.

**Ratatouille** (2007): [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IvnptQJ__U) beautifully delivered speech really does it for me.  Although I question Brad Bird's almost Ayn Rand like messages

**How to Train Your Dragon** (2010):  If you didnt see [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbZtfznQb-Y) in 3D you really missed out.  Ive never seen a film capture the feeling of flying quite like this.  John Powell's score makes me all tingly inside even without the visuals but with them... holy titballs.

**Once** (2007):  [THIS](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-_rkeqWdoog) is the song that opens up the film and when he gets to the climax of the song its breathtaking.  Glen Hansard is a god.  There are multiple examples of music in this film inducing frisson but I dont want to spoil the best ones for those who havent seen it :).",,t5_2smzw,True,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/mvcsv/im_tired_of_this_subreddit_becoming_all_music/

1358231025.0,16lsfc,[text] poem from Askreddit thread that stopped me in my tracks,qz002501,221,37,4,"This reminds me of a poem by Pat Ingoldsby For Rita With Love

You came home from school

on a special bus

full of people

who look like you

and love like you

and you met me

for the first time

and you loved me.

You love everybody

so much that it's not safe

to let you out alone.

Eleven years of love

and trust and time for you to learn

that you can't go on loving like this.

Unless you are stopped

you will embrace every person you see.

Normal people don't do that.

Some Normal people will hurt you

very badly because you do.

Cripples don't look nice

but you embrace them.

You kissed a wino on the bus

and he broke down and cried

and he said 'Nobody has kissed me

for the last 30 years.

But you did.

You touched my face

with your fingers and said

'I like you.'

The world will never

be ready for you.

Your way is right

and the world will never be ready. 

We could learn everything

that we need to know

by watching you

going to your special school

in your special bus

full of people

who look like you

and love like you

and it's not safe

to let you out alone.

If you're not normal

there is very little hope

for the rest of us.

1355377465.0,14rskg,PSA: Just what is Frisson? Let's clear up some misconceptions!,Koudvorst,204,27,23,"It has been noted by a few people around this subreddit recently that many top rated posts seem to be missing the ‘point’ of frisson. I would tend to agree

-------------------------------------------------------------------

A quick Google of the definition mentions that Frisson is ‘A sudden, it can also happen when looking at a photograph or having a sudden, deeply intense realization (although those are much rarer). 


Frisson begins to make a bit more sense if you look at the Wikipedia stub for it where it’s mentioned as: “A cold chill ... a **pleasant tingling feeling**, and sometimes producing a **shudder or shiver**.""^[2](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisson)

I bolded a few of the important defining physical characteristics of Frisson because in essence



Musicologist David Huron was recently studying music-related Frisson and found that Opera was a good candidate to evoke Frisson because: “Opera singers produce the bulk of their sound energy in the 3-to4-kilohertz range. Humans are quite sensitive to this range


‘Ok sure’ you say


Huron goes on to explain why we seek out the feeling of Frisson if it’s linked to such a fearful and mentally jarring sound: 


    The brain, the unconscious “fast path,” 
    is to “react as fast as possible, conscious 
    path
    Huron believes that he first reacts with fear towards the stimulus
    it by consciously recognizing that the stimulus is actually harmless.


As a result


Mind you this is all talking about musical Frisson

* Frisson can happen not just from music
* Frisson is a biological reaction to stimuli
* Frisson can be felt all over the body


So if you look at a photo, then you did not experience Frisson. That’s not to say you didn't experience emotion, just not Frisson.



I hope this was informative and helped clear up some confusion surrounding just what this subreddit is about! If you have any points to add

-------------------------------------------------------------------


**TL;DR**: Frisson is a physical thing, and memorable effect.

Son, your heart soaring just like that aircraft. You can construct beautiful sentences in your head, but the second you start talking to this girl, they get jumbled up and you end up stammering out a combination of mixed up words. Those words start winding around your brain and pulling a knot, making it impossible to think, and you eventually end up walking away, your cheeks as red as the blood that your heart is pumping through your body at a million beats per second. And it's beautiful.

Then years go by and love changes. Love warps and stretches until you don't even recognize it as the thing you felt back when you were 13. You look at this girl, just fades away. Now love brings a smile to your face, a warm feeling to accompany the soaring in your heart, and the spinning slows down. You'd walk to the ends of the earth for her. You'd take a bullet for her in a heartbeat, and you know that this is the girl you want to spend the rest of your life with.

You live out your lives together, almost. You know that you made the right decision, and your heart is bursting with love for this woman. A feeling that will never go away, not until the end of time.

You look at your wife, your other half, and you can't imagine life without her. You squeeze her hand one last time before she closes her eyes for the last time. You can feel a part of you being ripped out of your heart, but yet, it's still there. Now love is different. Love is a gallery of memories. You love your children, but nothing will ever compare to the love you felt for your wife. And the feeling is still there, buried under layer after layer of sadness. Regret. Wishing you could have done more. But love tells you that you did everything you could. It tells you she was happy.",False,,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1jo5eh/text_wasnt_expecting_this_from_rexplainlikeiama/

Today is my birthday and I tend to think fondly of that book on my birthday so I pulled it out and found the entry where he talks about me being born. I felt like sharing it:

June 13

*Guess what? You're here! And you're a boy! I guess you know that by now though, Thursday at 5:22pm. 8 pounds, 15 ounces, 22 1/2 inches long. Whew! That's a big baby, especially since your momma's kinda small.*

*When I first saw you come out, simply in awe. Your mom and I both were crying.* 

*All babies when they first come out are kinda blue and red and bloody and more or less look like lizards. But this was MY lizard! MY baby! MY son! I think I understood a little bit of how God must have felt when he looked upon Jesus and said ""Behold, my son. I love you so very very much.""*

(Skipping ahead a bit)

*""As I mentioned before, I have failed you in some manner I ask that you forgive me and please not do the same with your child. I love you, Caleb. Don't ever forget or doubt that. You will always be my beloved son.""*

(Skipping a little more)

*And joy washed over me like waves upon a beach. A silent quiet joy that envelopes a person and warms his inner heart. A joy so rich. A joy too full to be wasted on laughter. My son


My parents divorced when I was 7. So I didn't get to see my father a lot growing up. But at the age of 26, he's raised me incredibly well and I'm proud of who I am and who my father is. I hope he's still here by the time I have a child so that he can have an impact on his/her life.

&gt;Superman. It's always been Superman and it always will be. A good Superman story is hard to find. They're rare to the point that I can make a comprehensive list of them off the top of my head. But when one does come along... A good Batman story is entertaining and bad ass. And it makes you think ""Batman is cool."" A good Green Lantern story is generally fraught with emotional peril but
&gt;
&gt;It's the mythology of a sun god who wished he was a man because he saw something so great in us. It's the story of a hero who could move whole worlds and see through stars and hear a whisper on the other side of the planet... who fell in love with a storyteller. It's about a man and his dog. 
&gt;
&gt;Every single day, you might just sit down and get cynical, thinking thoughts like ""maybe we *are* inherently evil. Maybe there's just something *wrong* deep down in our hearts.""
&gt;
&gt;And then there's Superman. Looking down at the world with an unfathomable sadness. Waiting for us to join him in the sun. All the while
&gt;
&gt;*""If you knew how you are loved
&gt;
&gt;There's a psychology to storytelling. It's really quite simple. When presented with something light, we made one for our fiction. To guide us and make us feel brave. To let us hope.

But he didn't have to. Has face and laughs and noises said it all. He loved his family. And he could express his feelings without words. And I could express my love to him without words. But he was truly the happiest kid ever. Always happy. Always laughing. Always loving the llife he had. He was in the hospital half of his life. And even then he didn't mind as long as his family was there to support him. He died November of 2011. And let me tell you. I will NEVER be as happy as i wwas when I had him. Yes it was hard sometimes. But every second of making his milk. Changing out his feeding tube. changing out the cancer port. Carrying his wheelchair and milk pump everywhere we went was totally worth it. 20/10 would do it again forever. And i wish I had the opportunity to do it for the rest of my lifE .we never let his handicap hold us back. We went to the ocean with him and all over the US. He never held us back and loved all the traveling which is why we did it. He did more in his 4. 5 years than a lot of my friends have done in their first 30 years. We have 8000 pictures of him. And in 98% of them he's laughing or. Has a huge smile on his fface. 1% he is asleep.the other 1% is the bad times. And his whole life was like that. He was an extemely happy boy. And was in no way unhappy. And he never EVER put a burdon on us. He was the perfect little angel I miss him every second of every day. So. Yeah. I know from personal experience you are iincorrect in your opinion.""

The universe is huge. Time is impossibly vast. Trillions of creatures crawl and swim and fly through our planet. Billions of people live, cannot even properly imagine, the number of perspectives and variety of experiences offered by existence.

We sip all of this richness through the very narrowest of straws: one lifetime, one set of experiences. Of all the universe has, has had, and will have to offer, we can know only the tiniest fraction. We are alone and minuscule and our lives are over in a blink.
All of this strikes me as terribly sad

But here's the thing. Literature lets us experience life through a second consciousness. For a time we share the perspective and experience of the author and his imagination. Our experience of the universe is broadened

Months ago there was a move against music videos. People said

Then there was a bunch of solid content

Now

The problem isn't with the sub. Or with the people submitting. Or with the people voting.

The point I'm trying to make, it is a sudden sensation, like goosebumps or shivers, that comes from an epic moment. 

Perhaps we could find a definition that is less esoteric and better suits the needs of those who frequent this sub. What

I think we are still working through what frisson actually means by posting things that make our skin tingle. Sometimes this jives with other people

Let's figure it out. This sub is pretty cool for the most part

&gt;What the hell do people mean when they say ""live your life.""? It always comes off as some kind of contempt or scolding.

Live your life, or saving animals from slums, or feeding the poor what the fuck is wrong with me I'm wasting my everything!?""

&gt;I'm trying. I'm living. Maybe I'm not doing amazing things by the standards of others. Maybe I'm not courageous because I've never really been faced with a threat. I'm thankful I haven't. Is it shameful to be privileged enough to have food and work 9-5 and love my family and hug a cat that hasn't been saved from a ditch? Just a regular ass happy cat? Am I a coward because I didn't have to fight every day like poor Katelyn and her family? The thought of having to go through that twists my gut. Feels bad man. Have I not lived because I have not been burdened by tragedy?

&gt;You're living your life Tictacjo. And it sounds like you're doing some pretty awesome things. But your ""life advice"" is kinda crazy you know? I get what you're saying, ""Be.""

Oh, there's a tremendous amount of emotion about, and occasionally I become the scapegoat, but very rarely. Mostly I learn about love and about the hard lives many people have led; and about sacrifice. And learn again that dying is easy. It's life that's the bloody, bloody hard work.

ask what time it is;

""In 1927 Claude Friese-Greene shot some of the first-ever color film footage around London. He captured everyday life in the city with a technique innovated by his father

Though we usually think of French names like Lumiere and Melies when we think of early film pioneers, most now long since gone, pass before us like ghosts. What’s striking is, apart from the noticeably formal clothing and a few old cars, how familiar and unchanged everything seems. Trafalgar Square, which the film’s title card describes as “another monument to a hero of the past,” looks the same now

The British Film Institute used computer enhancement to reduce the flickering effect of the original Biocolour and bring us this striking rare film which transports us back through time.""",,t5_2smzw,1368892032.0,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1ekvzs/video_london_in_1927/

“Respond to the following questions by a show of hands

“How many of you can tell me something about your parents?”  Everyone’s hand went up. 

“How many of you can tell me something about your grandparents?”  About three-fourths of the class raised their hands. 

“How many of you can tell me something about your great-grandparents?”  Two out of sixty students raised their hands. 

“Look around the room

Oh sure, what they thought, what they were proud of, what they were afraid of, or what they dreamed about?  Think about that.  Within three generations our ancestors are all but forgotten.  Will this happen to you? 

“Here’s a better question.  Look ahead three generations.  You are long gone.  Instead of you sitting in this room
“Is your life going to be a warning or an example? What legacy will you leave?  The choice is yours.  Class dismissed.”

Wouldn't you know it, and sure enough, her eyes didn't leave me the whole time. Eventually, it got to be a little too much for me to handle, so I got up to leave. As I was standing up, she starting crying, hard.
I walked over to her at that point, but can I please give you a hug?""
I said yes, the memories, just, EVERYTHING in this old woman's cries.
The Subway workers saw, strongest, most potent reality check I've ever received.
She told me she'd empty her bank account to have that same experience there again.

full of people  
who look like you  
and love like you  
and you met me  
for the first time  
and you loved me.  
You love everybody  
so much that it's not safe  
to let you out alone.  
Eleven years of love  
and trust and time for you to learn  
that you can't go on loving like this.  
Unless you are stopped  
you will embrace every person you see.  
Normal people don't do that.  
Some Normal people will hurt you  
very badly because you do.  
Cripples don't look nice  
but you embrace them.   
You kissed a wino on the bus  
and he broke down and cried  
and he said 'Nobody has kissed me  
for the last 30 years.'  
But you did.  
You touched my face  
with your fingers and said  
'I like you.'  
The world will never  
be ready for you.  
Your way is right  
and the world will never be ready.  
We could learn everything  
that we need to know  
by watching you  
going to your special school  
in your special bus  
full of people  
who look like you  
and love like you  
and it's not safe  
to let you out alone.  
If you're not normal  
there is very little hope  
for the rest of us.  ",,t5_2smzw,False,,,True,http://www.reddit.com/r/Frisson/comments/1iysbj/text_for_rita_with_love_a_poem_by_pat_ingoldsby/

""We could not leave him where he was, before action, to finish off one another, if badly hurt: but I had never realized that it might fall to me to kill Farraj.

I knelt down beside him, for he opened his eyes, and clutched me with his harsh, scaly hand, the tiny hand of these unripe Nejd fellows. I waited a moment, and he said, Daud will be angry with you’, ‘salute him from me’. He returned the formal answer

The Turkish trolley was now very close, still with the shape of his body in them, just as he had fallen by the bridge. Near dark we halted; and the Zaagi came whispering to me that all were wrangling as to who should ride the splendid animal next day. He wanted her for himself; but I was bitter that these perfected dead had again robbed my poverty: and to cheapen the great loss with a little one I shot the poor beast with my second bullet.

Then the sun set on us. Through the breathless noon in the valleys of Kerak the prisoned air had brooded stagnantly without relief, but suddenly we felt them all about us, as waves of this scented air drew past us with a sticky sweetness. However, quickly it faded, and the night-wind, damp and wholesome, followed. Abdulla brought me supper,,False,t3_18rqpv

&gt;What do you do with the mad that you feel?

&gt;When you feel so mad you could bite?

&gt;When the whole wide world feels oh-so-wrong

&gt;And nothing you do seems very right?

&gt;What do you do?

&gt;Do you punch a bag

&gt;Do you round up friends for a game of tag

&gt;Or see how fast you go?

&gt;It's great to be able to stop

&gt;When you've planned a thing that's wrong

&gt;And be able to do something else instead

&gt;And sing this song:

&gt;I can stop when I want to

&gt;Stop stop stop

&gt;And what a good feeling to feel like this

&gt;And know that the feeling is really mine

&gt;Know that there's something deep inside

Only the monstrous anger of the guns.

Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle

Can patter out their hasty orisons.

No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells;

Nor any voice of mourning save the choirs

The shrill

And bugles calling for them from sad shires.

What candles may be held to speed them all?

Not in the hands of boys

Shall shine the holy glimmers of good-byes.

The pallor of girls' brows shall be their pall;

Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds

I was reading the transcript

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: There they are sitting in the classroom.  She's right there with him.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Of course she's wondering—

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: What have you've been doing for 27 years?! (Laughing.)

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: So she thinks well let me see if I can teach him some just basic sign language.  In an interesting case she takes out a book and makes the sign book.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: But the sign for book looks like opening up a book.  So he thought I was ordering him to open a book.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: So he grabs the book and he opens it.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Cuz he thought I was asking him to do something.  It was very difficult.  If I gave him the sign for standing up he thought I wanted him to stand up.  And so I couldn't

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Wait a second

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Well uh weeks

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Often times when we said goodbye or just left

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: But after a couple of weeks of him—

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Constantly miming

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: She had an idea.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Perhaps it's just possible that if I

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: I taught an invisible student.  I stopped talking to him and I stopped having eye contact. And I set up an empty chair

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: And then she says she would hold up to this empty chair a picture of a cat.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: and I was trying to explain to this invisible student that this creature

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Then she would hop to the other seat

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: ""Oh I know, I get it!”

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: So you're playing all the parts.  You're both the teacher and the invisible student.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: That’s right

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: Wow.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Doing all these crazy things and he’d just watch me.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: He stopped copying her which was good…

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: But. I’d do this over and over and over for days and days and days…

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: And she says he just didn't get it.

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: He looked bored a lot of times.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: But one day in the middle of one of these endless pretend student exercises…

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: Something happened.

 

&gt;ROBERT KRULWICH: Out of the corner of her eye

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: And he looked—It's interesting how his body was upright and he looked like something was about to happen. 

 

&gt;(Music.)

 

&gt;He looked around the room—this is a 27 year old man— and he looks around the room as if he had just landed from Mars and it was the first time he had ever saw anything. Something was about to happen.

 

&gt;JAD ABUMRAD: His eyes grew wider

 

&gt;SUSAN SCHALLER: He slaps his hands on the table.  “Oh! Everything has a name!”

Opinion: This music and scene can always make me cry, the one unhindered by adult entanglement. This last scene is incredibly revealing in their innocence and their final goodbye. We know, as the audience, that they will never meet again. It's possible that they know as well. Instead, they carry a short conversation in which they both try to ensure their future lives will be happy. It's only at the last moment do their feelings come up to the surface again.

Then he saw it. “I looked down and saw the profile of a big shark underneath me, under me somewhere, but between me and the beach.”

It was about then that things started to get interesting. “As I was paddling, cruising past me, going so slowly, heading out to sea. It was so close. At this stage I started getting really scared, you know, all these thoughts start going through your head. My 14-year-old boy was on the beach, and everything was happening so fast.”
The shark swam past, and I was thinking, ‘this can’t be happening. This can’t be happening.’ It was like a dreamy thing, almost like an out-of-body experience as I could actually see a shark attack about to happen. To me. I was thinking “This shark is going to kill me now.”

The shark hit Troy hard from underneath. “It hit me so hard and so fast. It hit me on the left side; hit the board by my hip. I got flung up and rolled over

Troy got sucked under the water
Troy surfaced. The shark was nowhere to be seen. Neither was his board.

“I was about 80 meters out, just expecting the shark to hit any second. I swam some freestyle and then I swam backstroke, just to keep my eye out for when it was going to hit, to fight it off if I could. As I came towards the shore I saw something dark in the water but it was a rock, and I remember standing on it, looking out to sea, feeling a bit safer. Probably wouldn’t have made any difference whatsoever if it had come back

Troy continued swimming. “I was swimming regularly, so just kept on swimming. It was only when I could stand on the sand did I feel safe again. I was totally numb, from the shock, but I was OK. A few little cuts and stuff. The strangest thing was walking back to my family without a board. ”

Troy was still alive. Shaken,” said Troy on his rehab process. “I just managed one wave before I came in. It felt strange.”

Maybe Ali has lobster claws instead of hands. And he's firing lasers out of his eyes.
