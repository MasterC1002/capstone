You lose her when you don’t notice that she notices everything about you: your use of the proper punctuation that tells her continuation rather than finality, your handwriting when you sign your name in blank sheets of paper, your muted laughter when you are trying to be polite, and more and more of what you are, which you don’t even know about yourself, because she pays attention.

She remembers when you forget. 

You lose her for every second you make her feel less and less of the  beauty that she is. When you make her feel that she is replaceable. She wants to feel cherished. When you make her feel that you are fleeting. She wants you to stay. When you make her feel inadequate. She wants to know that she is enough and she does not need to change for you

You must learn her. 

You must know the reason why she is silent. You must trace her weakest spots. You must write to her. You must remind her that you are there. You must know how long it takes for her to give up. You must be there to hold her when she is about to.

You know

Or perhaps you would be able to explain the joke in the 3 hours I spent alone, you'd know why I didn't laugh that first time when you'd told the joke.

And how you would have laughed, my male best friend laughed and said 'yea, right.  That didn't happen, I know what you're like.'  Wouldn't that be hilarious?  Imagine how I felt, that the person who was supposed to know and care for me the most implied that it was my fault that someone followed me, pinned me down, stripped me and then asked me for a tissue to wipe their cum off their dick once they were done.  It was hilarious, thanks to you.

But it's not a big deal, I'm being a bitch for not allowing you to joke about something you find funny.  I'm being a typical crazy female who's intruding on your world, I don't understand your lad culture and therefore my opinion doesn't count.

I mean, and they laugh without confronting you about it, they make it okay for you to make that joke.  It kills me inside every time, because my boyfriend is one of them.  Each time they make it okay for you to make the joke, they make the behaviour funny, they make it acceptable - the joke and the situation it's based on.

I think that's what makes me most angry.  Above anything else, doing to her what was done to me, is what she's wearing, that's what makes me sick.  The less she's wearing, the more likely you are to touch her, it's her fault she got touched, got raped

The only thing standing between any and every man in our society becoming a beast, is some thin slip of material that a woman chooses to wear or not to wear.  That's what you're saying, when you say 'she was asking for it', 'she deserved it', 'she needed to be brought down a peg'.  You're saying that.

If men can't be trusted to behave like rational human beings because they can see a bit more flesh on a woman

And women are the weaker sex?

The night I was attacked I was wearing jeans, and a thick scarf, just so you know.  I'd slept with 2 men at that time, both in committed, long term relationships.  I'd never kissed a stranger on a night out.  I'd never even worn a mini-skirt!  That man took what he wanted, and tossed me away like a rag.  Sometimes it's not about the expectation of being treated like a lady, most of the time it's more about the expectation of being treated like a human being.

So when you laugh at a girl being harassed because of her clothes.  Or call a girl a bitch or a slut because she won't kiss you.  I understand the joke now.  The joke is that you can do whatever you want, and I have to understand that it's because I deserve it for having boobs.

We didn't know that you were there hanging out, you insidious, invisible piece of shit. And I mean f.u.c.k.y.o.u. 
You made us so paranoid. So jealous of anyone around us who had a reason to smile. You took our amazing, present, and those to come.

You took him to unspeakable places of pain and fear and stripped away all his dignity. You showed us the horrible side of the doctors. You emptied our bank account. You made people shy away because they didn't know what to do or say. You alienated our families. You made me watch him take his last breath as he laid in my arms. You took my beautiful man and you zipped him into a black bag (thanks for the big scratch left in the wall from the funeral home stretcher, too - I love seeing that every day) and then you put him into the cold, cold ground. I go to the cemetery everyday because of you; instead of running home and jumping into his arms. We had a love unlike any other and you just couldn't stand it, could you? Happy now? Enjoying the fact that I cannot sleep? That I can barely make it through the work day? Digging my depression? Fuck you. Bet you love the fact that I am surrounded by all his things and I cannot even touch them for fear I will completely lose my mind. 

Cancer, a bully, a monster, and the most vile beast. I cannot believe you were there every time we kissed. You invited yourself along on all of our trips. That you eavesdropped on all of our conversations. That you lurked in our home, just waiting to claim him for yourself. You stole him from me and I will never forgive you.

I don't know if I'll ever shop around for names

When my bedroom is the right temperature, your emotions leaking out, blotting pages of your life that could've been perfect and beautiful if you'd been born with all the pieces together correctly. I don't ever want to buy corks to fill the hollows in your head and think to myself that this was my doing; my genes passed on an unlit torch and decimated a poor child before he or she could even walk.

I think less about the color of your eyes and more about the contours of your elbows

...but I'm terrified that I'll come home after work, hiding from me because you don't think I could ever understand your emotions or help fill in the potholes you fall in just because.

I am afraid you'll break my body

I don't want you to be a beautiful

I'm not extensively worried about hemming your pants

1363191634.0,1a8098,To the guy I friendzoned,scshraratoysuyrty,53,6,9,"I wanted to apologize for that time when you told your feelings for me. I admit I was being an asshole when I responded with ""I'm dating somebody else."" To be honest

I just wish I was able to explain myself then and offer a concrete reason why I couldn't be romantically involved with you. There were things about me that I didn't let you know

During the times when I'd go MIA, good and bad. This is primarily the reason why I kept coming back to him. 

I did try to entrust you with something. You knew a very delicate matter that happened to me. But I was scared you'd throw it at my face if ever we do get in a relationship. I was afraid we'd fight a lot and I'd just fuck everything up and hurt you. I didn't want you to get mad at me. I didn't want you to hate me. Being friends with you felt safe. It made me feel secure that we'd never breakup. It felt like I could keep you forever. I realize that I had selfish motivations but that was how much I wanted and needed you. 

I've never had good male role model when I was growing up and I felt really happy that I found it in you. I've always wanted to have an older brother because I never had one. I wanted to know how it felt like there's someone looking out for me. I've realized that this was more important than having you as a boyfriend because I found a best friend and a brother. Somehow I thought that sex would ruin that perfect image I have of you. 

Even if we didn't get together

Remember the time you asked me if you would be enough if you were my boyfriend? I instantly cried that night because I knew you would perfect. I just felt like I didn't deserve you. I'm sorry for whining constantly about the guys I dated. It must have hurt. Somehow

All those times you were mentioning about being friendzoned, a guy who purely liked me. I still believe that's you. Because in my mind you're still perfect and nothing will ever manage to tarnish that. 

I'm really sorry *********. I wish you're better off and happier now.

With you, it smiles and feels secure; knowing it would never suffer the same fate as from lovers past. This very same heart races when it feels your affections, flutters at the warmth of your smile and aches when you are afar. This heart is yours and I feel so thankful that I can give it to you.

I took a shower and I could not stop wondering what it is you are doing, cavernous hole in your chest that I do.
     
     

Does it feel like it is eating you from the inside out?
     
     

Did it start in the back of your aching mind, and crawl as if it were ivy toward your toes?     
          
     

Are you piling food into your empty chest to fill it up when you can't quite take the crippling bareness?
    
    

That's what I often do. When I feel especially used, bubbles, turns its way up my pipes and cleans out the matter. I need something stronger.
      
      

It's not as simple as medication. I can't down cough syrup or swallow pills to fix the bruised space in this body. You know what I mean. It hasn't worked for you either. At best it numbs

1339091054.0,uq33h,an open letter to all that speak of depression as though you're fucking her in your spare time.,pyrelic,50,9,10,"She will not call you back in the morning. Before that even comes, literally and figuratively. You will find that it is her palm held over your mouth that keeps you silent

Let it be warned that Depression has many friends, Hopelessness, Anger, Relentlessness— my God, she has a whole goddamned army ready to release at her disposal. They’ll befriend you slowly, gradually, until you’re composed of nothing more than the same atoms that they are. It will start with your loss of things, don’t you? Don’t lie to me. You take everything around you for granted and they can smell that

Don’t worry about their manners, every inch they take of you, will be the sigh of an apology. They’re not trying to harm you. See, Depression is just trying to find a home and she’s always right around the corner. She’s homeless and desperate and needs to find the souls of those that don’t take care of themselves or appreciate themselves or find the beauty in the world around them and these words, they fucking sting, don’t they?

Every single time you think you’re seeing a glimpse of something that could make you happy, whether it’s with your mouth or a blade, Depression comes with a revenge when you’ve side-stepped her for long enough. She’s like that ex you can never get rid of, that’s always right behind the corner, ready to devour you whole.

Lose sight of the stars. Forget that we live in a single galaxy among billions, less than a mote of sand in the greater world and that what we did yesterday, what we do today, what we make of ourselves tomorrow— it won’t matter in a decade, let alone in a thousand years, when we’re exploding and melt back into the star matter we used to be in the first place. Weren’t we so much more beautiful then, anyway?

If, and you’re none of this and this doesn’t apply to you, then out of respect for those souls that are so weighed down with how they can wake up in the morning or how they’re going to deal with being themselves for even a moment longer that they take a pistol to the back of their throat, get out of bed, get dressed, and get the hell out of Depression’s bed. You don’t just have a one night stand with Depression. It’s not like that. You get married with her, have children

Depression is a whore. Honestly, while meantime we’re crowding ourselves with little pieces of her in an attempt to get a better idea of ourselves. I don’t feel sorry for me, or you, or anyone else, I feel sorry for Depression— she keeps having little bits of her tore off without her permission, stapled into the ribs of strangers, and she hasn’t got a way to get herself back.

Good luck with your adventures, I’m only a letter away. Don’t bother me tonight, though— I’m breaking up with Depression so that I can find myself in the bed of a beautiful woman with midnight hair instead. If I’ve only got one life left to live, I don’t want it to be like this. I’ve unstitched the remnants she leaves trembling in the pit of my stomach and handed them back. I’m not interested in this melancholy business anymore.

1342238037.0,wja9c,i need you so much closer.,lovevsphysics,48,11,9,"there are so many things i want to tell you.
 
sometimes i think about calling you, *baby i am falling apart at the seams.*
 
and i know you'd laugh and shrug it off because every day i function like a normal girl.  my lungs expand and my blood circulates
 
and i want to tell you that this is the easy part, but every minute my chest is clawing like i have been drowning all my life.  i know you wouldn't understand, you'd scoff and tell me i'm fine.  you were never delicate, never tactful.  

but your love was there
 
these are the simplest things to tell you
 
i want to tell you that i'm sorry i didn't cry at your funeral.  i stood by your grave, your beautiful body, close enough to touch but never again able to feel.  something hysterical, deep-rooted in my nerves, screamed for my hands to close around yours for one last time.  and i knew if i held you one last time, i would hold you forever and that six feet would never- *could never*- come between our bodies.
 
and i want to tell you that i can still drive that stretch of freeway, and i try not to see the flashing ambulance lights scattering neon colors into the night.  and thousands of commuters follow me past, their tired eyes peering over paper cups of coffee.  they grind their teeth in bumper-to-bumper traffic, feet jammed on their brakes beside the place where your blood once painted the gravel.  it is just another unbroken line of city scenery, and i do not want to remember you here.  this road is not sacred, this metal is no memorial, and i will not look back through the rearview mirror again.
 
and i want to tell you that the bullshit people say about time healing all wounds is the emptiest promise ever made.  that this gaping, hemorrhaging with your absence.  and i'm so fucking angry that we spent so much of our lives together, irrevocably searing your memories into anything and everything.  i wish it could be as easy as this one song, this one movie, this one place or memory that i could burn, sell, or lock away.  but you fucking permeated everything and no matter where i am, does not lessen this inescapability.  
 
and i want to tell you that i always wake up at night feeling your body in bed, but for months i kept a body pillow under our comforter.  so that if i tried i could almost imagine your back curved away from me, your sleep-flushed face buried beneath the blanket.  this is the best part of my life these days, when i close my eyes and sink deep into the warm and golden place where your smile and your hugs are polaroids with blurry edges, flaring softly to life in my dreams.  and i want you to know that every time i wake up, it feels like losing you all over again.
 
and i want to make this clear to you: that the talisman is not the worst part.  i know that i will take this empty chest with me to the grave
 
i want you to know that the worst part exists in those moments i break down and call you.  your voicemail picks up after five rings

so i leave one.  i leave several.

I'm sorry. I can feel your sadness. Even across time twenty years

You're only five. So I'll try to keep this as simple as I can. But you're a smart kid. Never work without your gloves. You're a smart kid. Stay the hell away from love. In 2003 you're going to run into those lyrics for the first time. They're only going to get more relevant the older you get. But we both know you want nothing more than love. Even when you're sitting alone in your mom's old house writing this twenty years from now. You are a smart kid. But you'll need to work for it. Even if you don't understand everything I'm saying right now. You'll grow to understand.   

Enjoy what little of the perfect happiness you have left. I wish I didn't have to tell you that. I wish that in twenty years you did feel happy. Don't get me wrong. Things are better now. But I'm not you. I'm not about to get my confidence crushed by your mother when she screams at you “you used to be such a nice boy. What happened?”. You won't know what happened. You'll never know. At least when you're 25 you won't know. Its only a few months away now.   

Shortly after that is when the fighting will start. Between your parents. You're going to wish you could remember when your parents were happy. And your memory is so good. But you won't remember when they're happy. It'll start slow. Passively. But by the time Mom leaves in August of 97

You'll tell Dad this later

I'm sorry your half siblings don't love you. I'm sorry they don't want to be in your life. I'm sorry there will be nights you'll cry yourself to sleep because you can't see your niece anymore. She will love you. Maybe more than she loved anyone else. And you'll love her more than almost anyone else. I wish I could tell you you'll have a relationship with her again when she's older. But right now

I'm sorry you feel guilty for Dad's relationship with his other kids. Its not your fault. Their mom hated you and mom. And Dad for that matter. She told them to stay away. But he made a choice. He chose to be the Dad to you he wished he was to his other kids. I think he knew how much that meant to you. But make sure you tell him. Tell him before.   

The divorce will crush you. Sort of. More the counseling really. You'll know and understand that mom cheated on dad and that's why he left. It had nothing to do with you. But you'll waste too much energy trying to convince other's of that. You're going to blame a lot of your troubles in high school on this. Some of its warranted. Just try to move on as quickly as you can.   

You're going to build up your walls. And for years it will work. Until you meet a couple of girls who will tear them down. You won't date them. You'll want to. One won't feel the same way. The other...well...you know its just a sex thing. And you'll love her too much as a person just to use her.   

You're going to meet a girl who you think is perfect. You're going to chase after her for five years. She's going to break you. Its not her fault though. She's a good person. She's just too far away and won't feel the same way about you. You'll meet her replacement. She'll use you. You'll love her too. You'll make her a better person

There were a couple of other girls. Merely footnotes really. The one you'll set up with your best friend. She'll nearly kill him. But you'll redeem yourself by getting him to break up with her before he asks her to marry him. But more on that in a second.   

I'm sorry you'll watch your Dad become the adulterer. I'm sorry it'll almost get you  killed. Several times. He won't mean it. And on some level you'll hate him for putting your life in jeopardy. But remember, he did for love. Even if they used him. I'm sorry you'll follow in his footsteps.   

I'm sorry you're going to go through such a deep depression. I'm even more sorry that you're the one that's going to have to diagnose it yourself.  That no one around you will see the sorrow in you. That no one will understand why you got addicted to drugs to help ease the pain. That you wasted so much of your senior year because you hated yourself. I'm sorry that no one will speak up until its after the fact.   

You'll fall for another girl who will bring out the worst of you. She'll cause your life to spiral nearly out of control. You'll love each other
But you'll find a way in college. You'll get your life together. You'll find a sense of purpose. Meaning. You'll make things work. You'll make people proud. You'll find people who like you for you and not the money you used to have. You'll even find a girl who'll show you what love is really about. That every woman is special in her own way. And that you don't have to compare them to each other

I'm sorry. I'm so

I'm sorry that you turned to alcohol. I'm sorry that as you're writing this you're going to question if the first tumbler of whiskey was necessary. Much less this third one. I'm sorry you haven't found a way to pull it back together.   

And. The reason why we started this letter in the first place. You found another girl. And god is she beautiful. Not just on the outside. But on the inside too. She won't see it sometimes. But you will. The problem is she's dating your best friend. An even bigger problem is that she wants to be with him. The biggest problem is that you'll fall in love with her

I'm sorry. I know you wanted to get married and have kids. And I know you'll want to marry her. When she asked you if you would when she was wearing mom's old ring it will be all you can do to keep from kissing her and asking what you have to do to get her to keep it on. You're going to really feel like she loves you. And it'll be the most in love you'll ever have been in to this point.   

Your best friend will be living with her in a city that's an hour away. You won't want to move there. He will hate living there. It will slowly kill him. You're going to tell him to consider moving back here even if he works things out with her on a night he considers leaving her.   

You won't follow in dad's footsteps and become the adulterer. But it will be a constant fight every day. Dad drilled the concepts of honor and loyalty into you. And you will follow them the letter. You won't cheat. But you'll dream of her. Of touching her. Kissing her. Making here feel as beautiful as she is. Holding her. Sleeping with her. Doing all the things she wants from your best friend but doesn't get from him.   

I'm sorry you feel the way that you do. I'm sorry your life has been so much heartache. I'm sorry you put yourself in this situation. I'm sorry that you're willing to deal with and accept the consequences. But its not your fault. You've saved their relationship more times than you can count. But right now. The right thing to do may be to tell them to break up. You don't want to be with her that way. But looks at the facts. He's killing himself with booze and apathy there. Yeah she's made mistakes. But she's working on them. So much so that's she's starting to have good opportunities in the city. But he's away from his family. Where he wants to be. She doesn't want to leave. He does.  

Ha. You're starting to get too drunk to really make sense anymore. You won't understand how your writing heroes were drunk while they wrote. This isn't helping your craft at all.   

You want them both to be happy. And right now

But you're going to do whatever you have to support both of them. Because you love both of them more than anyone except dad. Because he is your brother. Because you want her to be your lover. If your relationship with her has to evolve you'll make it so. Because you want her in your life. No matter what. You're not afraid of finding someone else anymore. You've done nothing but find someone better every time. But right now

I'm sorry you're eyesight won't let you be a pilot. To be a war hero like your uncle. But you're gonna fly some day. I swear that to you. I swear I will get things together. But that's not for you to worry about. You worry about being you. You worry about growing up into the sweet kid your mom tells you she doesn't understand how you turned out to be so good. I'll find our way again. I swear. Because I want to. Because I need to. Because if I love her as much as I do, for myself. One day we will love ourself again. One day we will be happy. We just have to start walking down that path. Believe in me, lil Jake. Because sometimes, it feels like you're the only one who does.

I had just gotten some bad news from my doctor about a gum infection

The restaurant's been going through renovations for a week or so

Anyways, and generally getting ready to call it a night, when an elderly couple walked in (I'm pretty good at gauging my customers' ages, and these two were definitely past 85. Could barely make it through the door).

They asked if we were still open, and it might be best for them to come back tomorrow.
To my surprise

So I sat them down near the window (the restaurant otherwise totally empty) and got them their tea and a Tsingtao beer for the gentlemen. After leaving them to decide on orders, and what I saw split my face into an unexpected (and rather painful, given my sutures) smile.

The elderly gentlemen was dragging his chair around the table, leaning on one another, was precious. But it got better.

After they ordered a meal to share, which disturbed the plastic sheeting in the doorway and also made a godawful racket. They were using a rotary saw to dig through the particle-board subfloor, which was somewhat against building code and *definitely* not supposed to happen until all my customers were gone and the kitchen closed down. But there wasn't really anything I could do, other than get my customers some filter masks to wear (as we didn't know what was under the flooring, possibly mold, it was a suitable precaution).
So I found myself watching these two amazing friends share a meal,* and were still coming into restaurants to share late night dates, made me feel so much better. 

They stayed until past midnight, or that they had cheap filter masks strung across their faces.

I never got the chance to get their names, the restaurant was closed and the couple long gone. By the time I got home, I knew I needed to throw this story onto UL. It might not be much, but their obvious love and devotion to one another, even through all these years, really helped a tired and sick bartender to remember what's important and get back on his feet.

DON’T GET RAPED
    
    


An often sung mantra of my female life
    
    


When I was ten and barely understood that predatory strangers    
    


Prey on silent girls tripping through empty
    


I saw a man in his truck    
    


He watched me walk for a couple days across black pavement    
    


I never made eye contact    
    



But I could feel him there    
    



Finally unsettled
    


I began to walk the long way home    
    



All that time    
    


DON’T GET RAPED    
    


Bouncing around the walls in my head    
    


Reverberating
    



I never bothered to question why I had to be afraid    
    


Why DON’T GET RAPED was ingrained on the surface of my brain    
    



Why I ate precaution with my after school snacks and    
    


Poured scared over my breakfast cereal instead of milk    
    



Why no one once applied simple subtraction    
    


Instead I’ve heard warnings my entire life    
    


They are important
    
    


But still I feel angry
    
    


That never once have I listened in on a conversation
    
    


And heard someone firmly say

I know you still can't hear, and you still keep me up at night thinking. I wanted to say Happy Birthday, after all I know you wont be telling me happy birthday tomorrow. I'm writing you this letter because you promised me a discussion we have never had. It still bothers me to this day that I haven't gotten this off my chest.

That year and a half we spent together was the best I have ever had with a girl. I still remember the cute faces you would make and the inside jokes we would have. When I met you I wasn't put together, in a way the blind leading the deaf. We continued to break each other, and I speak for myself when I say this, but some how when when we were together it felt like everything was ok. As if my flaws and insecurities didn't matter. We were a Helen Keller couple out to prove that love is blind and turns a deaf ear to those who appose it. 

On my birthday it will be exactly 5 months since we broke up, and we spent more time together we walked out of shit smelling like roses. And let me tell you!! I have never felt worse... You haunt me in a way no one else can. You are a disease in my flesh and a virus in my mind. I work harder than I ever have only to run away from your image. I go nowhere in my head, but my body is making leaps and bounds.

Forgive me for being selfish and wanting you for myself, you were a fresh adult still in her teens, but had to grow up way too early. 

Looking back to when I first saw you walking into the restaurant and  can still remember what you wore. You were gorgeous, the deaf world. You discovered a culture where I could hand feed you keys to riddles like ""143"" ""I love you"" or ""I hate you"" or ""258"" ""Very interesting."" I gave you, your escape from the reality that you lived. 

When you told me your father had cancer I knew you were telling me I had to make a choice. I thought about whether or not to continue dating you for a long, if you needed me to hold you I had an iron grip. I felt like the perfect boyfriend. Yes, I had been a shitty boyfriend to the girls before you and this is my karma. The one relationship I would try my hardest on, you probably couldn't respect because you didn't know what to expect. But that's ok.

I remember when your father died, but in my heart I knew differently. Something told me that once everything had settled down you would find your balance and get bored of me.

Look as us now, well im still pissing and moaning about letting you go. Forgive me for still hurting, karma is a bitch and I probably deserved what I got. I am sorry for what you went through, you were too beautiful of a person to feel that much hurt. One thing I will thank you for is showing me that it is far better to love and be hurt, than to have been loved and felt nothing.

I no longer know who you are, you aren't the girl I started dating. No girl is, I always told you, ""You are never with the same person you first started dating, it's whether or not you love the person they have become that is important."" I guess I grew into someone you couldn't love.

You will be happy to know that since we have been separated, and no one or a button up to be buried in. Be grateful you had even a friend there to help carry the burden that your life had given you. Be grateful that you had love to light a way through a dark time.

What am i grateful for? I am grateful for the family I had never met and the townspeople who I did not know, that you live with a hard working father and a wonderful, hard working mother. Be grateful that your daily life isn't a woman that cant control her illness or a man that can't control his addiction. But with you it has never really been about me.

Most of all... be grateful for the life i helped you find. Use it to your advantage, and make a dream life, not a nightmarish living. I loved you, and this will be my only letter to you. You have taken enough of my life to call your own. I will no longer bitch and moan about who you were to me, because my life isn't bad. I am a success in my own way, and i consider you one of my greatest achievements.

It doesn't matter to me that we'll be on the same campus. It doesn't matter to me that I'll be spending time at your apartment

It doesn't matter because I will break numerous bones in your body if you ever touch me like that again. Your baby sister has become lethal, I would have broken every bone in that hand. This is not a threat, sweetheart: this is a promise. You will never hurt me again, and you will never hurt that sweet girl who you claim you've fallen in love with. If I have my way, you will *never* hurt anyone ever again. I won't press charges, but I make sure that every female friend you have knows you have a dark side. An angry, abusive dark side. 

I was supposed to be able to trust you. To be able to turn to you for anything. Protection

I'm grateful that once we entered high school, and somehow you just couldn't handle your friends liking me. By the end of my freshman year, you were graduating and you were afraid of me because you knew that I could kick you ass. You'd deserve it, too. You are a lying sack of shit and someday I will kick your ass. 

A few weeks ago I took a women's self defense seminar with my best friend. Most of it I had no issue with. Some of it I had already figured out on my own: buck your hips to throw your attacker off balance, and you should have seen her face. It was a cross between horror and murderous intent. I actually had to take a break for a few minutes because the husband of one of the instructors wanted to see if I could throw him off. I couldn't even try, because he looked just a little like you. The fear was back, if only for a split second. I started fucking CRYING. I was horrified. How is it, that even after you've been gone, you still have some kind of power over me? 

Maybe if I had been able to fight back you wouldn't have beaten the shit out of me at every opportunity. Maybe our parents would have fucking believed me when I said you were hurting me

Of course, I could not even cuddle with the man who became my boyfriend because his fingers became yours and his kisses became yours. It was a stark contrast: gentle to harsh and biting. I didn't want to remember, but I did. I had to fucking *throw him off of me* because I couldn't bear to be touched. It took fucking WEEKS. 

We were so careful, but he has been so good for me. Fuck you for screwing up part of my life. YOU WERE THE REASON I COULD NOT TOUCH ANYONE FOR FOUR YEARS OF MY LIFE. Any touch that I received during that time period was a punch, a slap, or a kick from you. I have come so far since then. 

So go fuck yourself. I am becoming the person you tried so hard to prevent me from being. You told me that I would never amount to anything, sweetheart? 

I have a higher GPA than you ever did, not for what I can give him. I am healthier and happier than I ever was, so fuck you for telling me that I couldn't do it. Because I've done it, and here I am. 

It doesn't matter that you're coming home for a week-long visit

I will not say sorry for saying this. I will say sorry for not speaking out against you sooner. I felt as though I couldn't. I still don't feel safe with you sleeping in the same house that I am. The only thing that comforts me is the knowledge that I have through months of martial arts training. I am not afraid to hurt you if you try anything.

We haven't seen each other in about two weeks and it is really weird sense you and I would spend some time together nearly each day. I guess I should tell you that I fell in love with you over the course of this year

These feelings really suck because of your girlfriend. You and her have been together for a year and a half now. I would just like to say that while my feelings are inappropriate, but that was just so I didn't teeter into the street). If anything happened it was emotional. I'm not sure if it was just one sided either. My best friend believes that you, at one point, had feelings for me too. The way you called me for dinner, asked if I had gotten back to campus yet from a weekend at home, to those late night walks we would take for the sake of boredom. 

While this confession is one of the main reasons I am writing you, but now that the semester is over, your girlfriend has time for you, which is probably the reason I have not heard from you. Two nights ago though was my true realization for the feelings I have though. She posted the picture on Facebook. The picture of the ring you got her. I know its not an engagement ring, but it hit me hard. I cried over you, and from what you know about me, it takes a lot for me to cry over something. I realized that I love you.

First the hood went on. My favorite. Then you bound my arms the way we love to have them bound. Then you gagged me.

Safe word use has never been a problem before. It started to get too intense. I was screaming RED at the top of my lungs. SCREAMING IT. You didn't hear it. You thought I was playing. I was snapping my fingers like crazy. You didn't hear it. You kept going.

When you understood what I was doing you stopped and you were so upset. I spent the next hour comforting you even though I was so scared I was shaking like a leaf.

I know it was an accident. I know that. But it was still rape. And I'm angry about it.

I look at you AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO SAY. You want to talk about it. I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE TO BEGIN. You want me to confide in you. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DEAL WITH WHAT FUCKING HAPPENED.

Nothing I’ve ever done has lingered with me quite as much as certain things I haven’t done. The un-done is haunting. Because a fantasy is like a ghost, you throb just like I do. We never had sex. We barely even touched. We hugged hello and goodbye, and you rubbed my shoulders for a thoughtful moment the last time I saw you. As I was turning to leave, you gently stroked my cheek. But we’ve never shared a single erotic caress. This makes everything we did so much more erotic. The fact that you were trying so hard to be good, the friction of your struggle, as if you could barely contain the massive excitement you felt from simply sharing the same room as me – the idea that I was irresistible to you, so you didn’t trust yourself around me. All of this just turns me on. Remember when we got coffee, no.” My god, you could have cut it with a knife and eaten it for dinner. It would have comfortably served four.

Let me hurt for you.

Let me take my courage

I know what pain is. Far better then I wish I did. I've had my share of suffering. But I’m strong. I’m cheerful and I’m optimistic. I can take it. Give me your pain and your hurt, your sadness, your anger, your jilted heart.

Let me *feel* for you what you refuse to let yourself feel.

Let me show you what love and happiness and comfort truly are.

Let me in.

I will wait forever

You've trusted me with your broken
intelligence, and your desires. But you won’t give me that hurt part of yourself. You don't think that part, any part of you, deserves love or acceptance.

You can't see yourself clearly. You spend your day staring at the murky reflection of your half formed self-concept

I hold in my hands an incomplete puzzle. I see not a full person in public, mud splattered bits you try so hard to keep hidden.

Life and its people have so carelessly trampled your gifted, every small breath I will dedicate to mend this shining source of fame.

Let me give you all the love and care that I tried so desperately to give others. They struggled in ways that were not for me to meddle in. I couldn't do anything for the most important people in my life. I was forced to leave them behind because I didn't know how to help them.

But I've learned your patterns and heart in ways I never knew theirs. I've learned my lesson from those failures and short comings, to be here for you. I was made to be what you need.

Please let me be that.

Let me be what you so desperately deserve and want.

Let me be what you won't let yourself have.

Let me love *every* part of you, future; success, failure, procrastinator; happiness, sadness, pain. I want all of you. And I always will. There is nothing you could ever say or show me that will drive me away. I've already discovered your darkest secrets and hidden emotions. I know you, far better than you know yourself. I've known from the moment you first spoke. And I love what I saw

You are worth more than I will ever be able to describe. You are worth more than any metaphor or simile that springs to mind with cliche intensity that I could possibly write down.

I never really connected with people before and when I met you I felt like we were kindred spirits

When we stopped talking it hurt much more than it should have. I felt awful, I didn't know what to do with myself. It took a long time to get over the loss of your friendship, and I wish so much that we could have another night just talking like we used to.

I started to worry when you took up injecting ketamine.  I kind of knew it was a bad line to cross.  Pricking yourself with a needle to get off is

I remember the first time I watched you do heroin.  It was you and I and two other guys who I had no real affection for.  I wanted to be cool with it.  I mean, so it couldn't be that bad.

You guys all took your bumps from the little envelope and laid back to watch TV.  It kind of smelled like flowers.  You were all silent for about 15 minutes before a few comments started to trickle out about whatever we were watching.  Each comment was always met with ""dude shut up

Around then was when the crew drama started.  The truth is... I fucking hated Mike.  I didn't give a fuck if you told his girlfriend he cheated on her.  I was bound by stupid fucking guy rules to act outraged and play along.  I had to drive those idiots to your house so they could ""jump you.""  Those fucking pussies couldn't do anything and didn't.  I'm sorry I enabled that pathetic attempt at a beatdown.

The guilt I still carry in my heart to this day is that I used it as an excuse to push you away.  I was scared of watching you become a junkie so I used it as an excuse.

For everyone

Today

It's normal

But when I was a kid and was living with my family, from being myself.

My constant, was you.

It's simple. The years we were in touch, it's not that simple because sometimes, life just is too complicated to be shortened like that.

Well

You had the perfect family. Two adorable younger sisters. A perfect loving mom who was a much better mom to me than mine ever was. Even a dad who could talk and love

I grew up in a train wreck. You knew that. I knew that

But we didn't have to. How many times did I eat breakfast with you while both of our families were asleep during the summer?

How many times did I sleep in the basement

Of course, or because it was too late to walk home when I was still living close.

But the truth was that in your cold basement, I slept better than in my house next door to my own family.

But I didn't really know that back then. I think you did. I know you mom did

Perhaps that why you became roommate with Max as an adult. He doesn't talk and he doesn't need to have you talking. You could just be roommate and both pretend like you were good friends to the outside world.

But I know it was a lie. Max told me

It didn't  surprise me. Because you and I never really had that conversation

I think the only difference between me and him

I am not sure anyone ever got that.

Remember when you threw your monopoly board across the room? That was the only time I had seen one of your famous fits of rage.

When you were about to explode near me

But not that day. That day

So nothing calmed you down. You threw the board up and ran to your room, in the living room.

No one understood. They all looked at me for guidance. They all asked me to go talk to you after you locked yourself in your room.

But what good would it have done? We didn't talk. That's not how it worked between us. 

But they couldn't understand that and they couldn't understand why you threw the board. I did. I even understood before you threw it. I didn't know you would do it

I think you knew I understood. I think that may be why you didn't look at me when you threw the board. Maybe it wasn't my ex in the way. You couldn't face me. Not that day.

Because that was also the day you told me it wouldn't last with her. That she was wrong for me. Well, and I knew you knew I understood even thought not a single word was said.

 It lasted a few more weeks but she dumped me. Perhaps she knew I knew.

And I did know it. Just like I knew you approved of the next one. I married her

You weren't my best man. Sometimes I regret it. Sometimes I feel like it was justified.

It's not that we weren't closer

Can you imagine yourself making a toast? 

I thought you knew. But I wasn't sure and when I checked with you

It was like that. No one else understood that. In a way, except that we also talk.

But then again, was it?

You taught me English that way. Did you ever realize it? I am sure you did. Without you

Well, I wouldn't even know that you need practice to do sports.

Ridiculous isn't it ? My family sure didn't teach me that. You did.

You don't remember? Think about the tennis balls. It's that stupid. We never even talked about it. It just happened. I arrived one morning at your house and you were bouncing the tennis ball on the wall and suddenly

You simply practiced.

It had never occurred me. 

I am a software developer.  Do you remember when I helped you on your old computer when we were kids ? I do. 

I am pretty sure you were better than you let on. I think you detected an interest in me and helped me cultivate it. Those days

When your left knee began to hurt

A few friends of ours heard about the accident. I was the only one who knew you and who knew that your left knee hurt like hell. Hey

But I didn't know that.

How could I have known that? We had a special relationship. I knew that. You knew that. We never had to speak about it.

But I didn't know even your wonderful mother didn't know about your knee injury. I swear. I didn't. I know you know I didn't. Don't ask me why I now know this. Words cannot convey it.

I did know however that no one knew about your later right knee injury. I know because I saw you cry that one time you helped me. The only time in over 20 years I ever saw you cry.

You made me swear not to mention it. Not by words

You were holding your right knee. You were hoping I didn't notice it was a different knee

I am not sure many would have understood anyway. You were the geek, but never once they met you.

It was uncontested. No one in their right mind would call me the intellectual when I was next to you. I knew it. You knew it

But we weren't the nerds they thought we were. I was good social skills. I made girlfriends

You had your sports. But that's the thing. No one who knew you in life except me knew about the sports.

No one who knew you in sports knew about your life. I didn't KNOW that. I never met your sport friends. None of us did.

But you told me their names. And you talked to me about them. Like you never talked about anyone else. And I could feel you being different. Like a jock born with a big brain.

In fact, you talked. Physics and geekdom, we lived. 

Well,there would be this conversation which would cement in my mind that we did have an understanding.

Then, watching TV. I remember it vividly. It was 21h37. The Simpsons were over for 7 minutes and Family guy was on.

You mom was asking when was the last time I had spoken to you. It had been on the Friday

That day

I knew the name of the bar back then and I told your mom. I forgot it now

That Friday

We followed it perfectly

But I didn't sense anything. Perhaps I was in a rush. For years

Your mother cried of joy when she heard we spoke on Friday. She was relieved. As if having spoken to me solved everything.

I told about your plans on Saturday. I couldn't know no one else knew about them. I couldn't know you had this part of your life just to you and by extension

Your mom was confused. She didn't know about the volleyball team. She didn't.

Tuesday, but I guess you didn't want to ruin anyone's week-end and left your wallet at home, on the table. You only brought your keys to lock the door.

Why? They wondered at first. Why bother to even lock the door? But you were a creature of habit. You even did the dishes. Even your mom didn't understand why.

But I did. You didn't want her to have to do it. I knew that. I know you knew I would know it.

Instead, but I couldn't abandon your mother. She would have been left all alone in your apartment.

We spent 30 minutes together and we managed to get the first full image of who you really were. Even your father doesn't know what happened in those 30 minutes. Your sisters either. 

I didn't know that your mother had never been to your apartment. She had been to Max's apartment when you had been with him. But not to that one. No one had. Not even Max. Only me. Did you know already when you moved there? Probably not.

I couldn't bear it alone, but couldn't tell the difference between which parts of me are original and which parts grew with you.

You mother could. You mother could see you in me

The official police report say that you stopped talking your calls and answering your door on the Thursday

But you didn't answer your phone or your door that Thursday, during my call. Why would you have lied about that when you never lied to me?

I think you had decided to do it on Friday morning. I think Thursday was your last day

So I think you waited for my call on Friday

You knew, I would call on the drive back.

You knew that. You could count on that. But I didn't call on Thursday. Perhaps I didn't have the time. Perhaps my wife called me. Perhaps my phone batteries were dead.

So

Did you hope I would know? I bet you did. Did you hope I would eat with you like I often did? You knew I couldn't on Fridays. 

I guess you had hoped for a Thursday meal and gave me a last chance on that Friday.

Of perhaps you wanted to hear my voice for the last time.

I don't know. Because you see

I love life. I do. You knew that. I knew that you knew that.

I now think that perhaps

But your knees made you blind again. The pain made you forget about life. The suffering made you jump

You didn't leave a note. It's not your style. But I know why you did it. Officially

It took me years to finally do it

My wife also knows about it

But the others, they could only hear the words.

But today, I only see the words too. I search for more, but I can't find it anywhere outside of my house.

But today

Because you see, a part of me also died.

I am beyond any semblance of sense at this point.  
If I could make it out of all of this with my sanity intact it would be a fucking miracle.

I'm in love with you. 

At this point you may be wondering why I've never told you this before.  
Unfortunately that's a long fucking story that I just cannot begin to tell you right now.  
The list of reasons is endless and most of these reasons are so fucking stupid that I'm too ashamed to even write them down.

Basically it can all be boiled down to extreme cowardice and just being an incredibly pathetic excuse for a human being. 

What if I were to tell you that I've been lying to you this whole time?  
I remember. Everything.  
I probably remember it better than you do yourself.  
I also think about it all the fucking time. It's burned onto my brain.  
I can't escape.

If there were words to express how sorry I am I would use them.  
I would scream them until my throat tore through.  
I'm sorry to the point where I don't even know if I'm sorry anymore.  
I don't know what the fuck to believe.

I regret everything.

Nearly five years ago, you and I walked along the beach together. You put your arm around me and we talked. Just talked. I didn’t know what to do and I didn’t know what I wanted.

Eventually though, to eventually fucking, and it was the best sex I’ve ever had. The way you’d say my name would make my body ache with desire. I still imagine you saying it, in that seductive way you did, as I fuck him instead of you. 

You would text me

When one of us felt guilt, and we got engaged. I thought you and I were done. But I couldn’t help myself. Imagining you inside me made me contact you, and I thought you wanted me as much as I needed you.  Sometimes, you’d jokingly say that you wished you had met me first. I didn’t know if you meant it or not. If you had only asked me to leave him for you, I would have. But you never admitted to really caring about me, and we’d just say we’d never work out. 

When I finally got married, I wanted more than anything to just tell you what a huge mistake I’d made. But you didn’t say you wanted me then either. I don’t know why. Was it pride? Fear of rejection? Didn’t want to ruin your friendships? I wish you had just been honest then.

When you told me we couldn’t see each other any more, and eventually, I just let myself forget you. You’d hurt me too much.

You dated other people. We didn’t talk much. Then, and sent me a text. 

“I miss you.” 

I knew what that meant

Just one month later, I knew you’d be there for me. And when I told you I was thinking of having sex with someone else, that’s when you said what I’d wished you’d said. I told you that having sex would be a bad idea. You said you wanted to do it anyway. I said, but why? Your response?

“Because it’s us. Because it’s you. It’s always been you.”

And we had sex that next day. You apologized for breaking my heart me. I cried. We had sex again and again. Then, and that is why I now am not a part of your life. 

But I love you. Not picking you was the biggest mistake of my life. You will always be my what if. You will always be the one I fantasize about spending my life with. You will always be the one I imagine having sex with.

Ever since I confessed to you about my depression, and I saw the look of familiarity in your eyes, I decided I owe it to you to forget your pain.

A couple of weeks into the job, that you were strange and incredibly moody. They advised me to steer clear unless I was obligated to work with you on a project. And it just so happened that we needed to consult with one another on a project. I eventually saw the attitude that the others were referring to. Right away I closed myself off. We had a disagreement, and we stopped talking to each other completely. I'm ashamed to say that I went along with the rest of the herd, and said some angry things about you behind your back. To this day it's still something I really regret and think about a lot.

But then, there was no way we could avoid each other. We were tasked to work on another project together, and we were pretty awkward around each other. That is until we realized we were acting like 5 year olds. And from that realization a new, somewhat tenuous relationship began to form. 

We began chatting to one another on a regular basis

Now, and the first to make me laugh despite my bad moods. To think that after being total assholes with each other, we somehow grew to be so close. You're the only one that I feel safe opening up to, and the only one that I can act like myself around without fear of being judged. I only wish that I had come to my senses ages ago. I wish I hadn't listened to the silly gossip that always seems to travel around an office environment. And most importantly, I want to thank you for trusting me enough to feel comfortable opening up and letting me into your life despite the bitchy attitude that I used to convey in all of our dealings with each other.

Four years. Is that really all it's been? When I speak to you I feel like I'm coming home


My best memories are the times I've spent with you. Christmas day in the forest, trying and failing to make cocoa, cold nights in the neighborhood park and that sweet, sweet date at the pizza place where we said more with our eyes and smiles than anything that came out of our mouths. (The Jamaican jerk pizza was fucking fantastic too, and don't think for a minute that I didn't see you eat more than half the goddamn thing you cheat. Love you.) We were minority kids in a white suburb with nothing to lose and no God to answer to, and we took what chained us to our setbacks and turned them on their head. We drank, we smoked, and it was beautiful. Our bodies were ruined but our minds were fierce and electric and alive, the environment, begging to pick your brain to see what other gems you kept locked in there. And I did. I learned everything about you



So



I don't love you because you're beautiful (you are), or because you're witty or cynical or sassy or confident or any of those things. *Anyone* could love you for those reasons. But when I look at you, when I hear your voice so many miles away on the telephone, when I trace with my fingertip the smudged ink of your handwriting in your letters, it feels like sunshine is pouring right into my open veins. You--and I mean *all* of you, everything that you have ever seen, felt, heard, the pangs in your heart, but perfect can go to hell


Look at you. You're on top of the world at an Ivy League school. Nothing makes me happier than calling you up and hearing how fantastic you're doing, and I feel like I can't take much more of this constant madness. I've wandered all over this world and still my mind will not leave me, no matter what hemisphere I desperately run to. There is no peace for me anymore, no peace at all; I feel like I can't escape the beating drum of my fate. Yet just hearing your voice can take it all away, if only for just a few minutes, and I know I can always call and let wave after wave of warmth and love wash over my tired, happy bones. But this cannot last, V

I see this money as restitution for the terrible childhood I had at your hands. Since the money means so much to you, so that you will understand why youll never meet your grandson.

You are terrible people

When I was 3 years old, you dolts. in addition to not making me go to sleep, the exercise caused me to tear some of my abdominal muscles, resulting in the hernia that I had to go to surgery for. Didn't the doctor find it strange that a 3 year old had a hernia? that something that usually happens to older people. Im sure there were questions of abuse at the hospital. I know there certainly were within the family.

And what about that so called 'leaky stove pipe' that

when I was 4 years old

when I was 5

I was never allowed to leave the house except for school. I wasn't allowed to have friends, he was happy.

when I was 11, norm hit my legs so hard the skin split and I bled. I had his hand prints on my thigh for two weeks. and you gave the money to the crackhead in the trailer park that, under torture, I claimed I had stolen it from. 

when I was 13, and screamed at me for ten minutes about a glass that hadn't been washed. I went back to bed with the promise that next time, the glass would be broken and stored in my throat. even with how loud he got, you didn't wake up and come see what the commotion was. or maybe you pretended to be asleep.

for my 15th birthday, nothing. you got me a yoyo and a bike. I was excited about the yoyo because I knew I could play with it. I wasn't excited about the bike because I already had a bike that you rarely let me ride. and no farther than 1/4 mile from the house. you were so indignant that I was ungrateful to receive this machine that we all knew I would never be allowed to use. so you took it back to the store and grounded me for two months for being ungrateful.


and none of this has included the mental abuse that was enacted upon me over the years. as soon as we arrived in California, too, but only during arguments. but me, I was unable to fight back, so I was his verbal punching bag. he told me at least three times a week that I was never going to amount to anything accept a prisoner. that I would never do anything with my life. Ha. look at me now. in the three years since I left high school, Ive accomplished more than either of you ever have.

and then we have the climax of my life with you. the night I left. I decided I was leaving that afternoon. I took 600 dollars, and pitched my tent. I woke up again at 8 am. and walked the rest of the way to Hawkins Bar. I ate breakfast there and traded my recognizable brown coat for a black one. and I walked. I must have walked 15 miles before I got my first ride. rode all the way from Burnt Ranch to Weaverville, and walked another 5 miles through the town before catching another ride for 3 miles.  I finally caught a ride all the way to Redding, and bought a ticket to Vegas. people were nice to me, and I couldn't get enough. When I arrived in Vegas. a guy bought me a ticket the rest of the way to Michigan, saving me from having to spend the last of what I stole from you. And then I arrived in Michigan and called you. The first words you said were ""Why did you take the money?""


not, not are you okay... Why did you take the money.

And so I came to the conclusion that you and your shitty asshole husband care more about your money than your family. Therefore

I gave you my world

Every truth
I could name the details of your bedroom like I could name the details of your skin. Every bump, because I was a part of you, I was the same as you. We joked that we were the same person, that we blended into one. We said that when our friends would see us again they'd exclaim in surprise that we'd made it, that we'd stayed together after all that time. We talked about our wedding; the dress, the colors, the flowers, the guests

It's so strange to me how much I don't want any of these beautiful things with you anymore. Because, I don't. I learned something, I came out on top, I'm not bitter about it. In fact, I think what we had -- at one point -- was absolutely beautiful, and I wouldn't take any of it back. Not even the fighting, the name calling, the crying

You were my everything. I let you be my everything. 

And then I let everything go. 

And when you let go of everything

And I flew the fuck away. I flew away from the anxious hands strangling my lungs; the anxious thoughts crippling my brain; the anxious soul surrounding my heart. 

And when I swiftly landed back on solid ground I realized you never flew. You walked a bitter path. You moved forward and dragged your bitterness with you. While I flew

I was ready to let you back in, platonic way. I was ready to make amends. But seeing the hate you harbored, I didn't need to lift a finger. I didn't need to try make things right, because, why make things right with someone so wrong? 

You were my everything. You were my air. But I held my breath and you soon became toxic within me. And once I finally exhaled

You became nothing but a reoccurring memory that nags at me here and there when I'm reminded by a song, those memories will fade completely. Those songs will have new connotations, those sounds will be merely noise, and you will blend in more and more with the background, blend in more with the nothingness.

He use to take me out to the old place when I was younger. He could never play music but he said my mom would play for him while he hacked away for fire wood. 

I took her violin with us. 

It is just really a field now. The house is long gone. Just an old dirt driveway that leads nowhere

I lifted her violin to play as he looked around trying to remember any piece he could. He called me her name and tried to tell me a story he couldn't quite remember. It was out here that she had told him about me as I grew in her belly. She would never tell him who my father was and it was a secret she took to her grave. In his eyes, and I will always be extensions of each other. Our stories that interlock and forever influence each other, even now that she is gone. 

"" I am pregnant.""

The tall grass scratched at my bare legs as I waited for him to respond. 

"" They haven't fixed the fence. The chain needs to be replaced "" is all he had to say

My voice raised

Quiet. No acknowledgement. 

He passed me and I reached out for his hand. He stopped. I threw my arms around him and cried and told him I loved him. 

He patted my back and laughed and said something about where his old dog was. Then he pulled away.

But the crease, never disappears no matter what I do. And I can’t bring myself to ask about the history behind your sadness. I don’t know what am I afraid of, because nothing can be worst than you telling me you don’t love me. 

Yes, I can’t help to want to heal your open wounds into scars, then into scabs, then hopefully one day its nothing but a beautiful mark from your past. 

I don’t think I can do this alone anymore.

I don’t understand how can someone has such deep feeling towards another person without sharing the same mutual feelings.

I hate not knowing how you feel about me, and I hate knowing how I’ll never be quite human in your eyes, even (especially?) when you know that they don’t feel female. I hate knowing that you don’t even realize how hurtful you are. I hate knowing that we can never be together because of these things, you’ve always been accidentally cruel and blinded by the awful glare of society. I thought you were intelligent and perceptive enough to see through all that

And yet, and I have my head on your chest and your arm is around me. You feel comforting, like home. And especially the last time, when you went slow and pushed me down and held my hands and kissed my neck –it was almost like you loved me back and that is going to kill me goddamnit. I don’t even like that kind of sex, but somehow it was amazing to do that with you. And you’re so damn pretty. I love your refined muscles and your narrow hips and your long blonde eyelashes. I love the shape of your lips and the way you kiss and the way your shoulder feels when I bury my face in it. I love the way you make me laugh and your stupid catchphrase humour and when you quote Killzone just to piss me off. I want to hold your hand in public and kiss you when I pick you up for a gig, even if the tuba player is sitting in the backseat. I want you to come over more often so we can just cuddle and talk and make out sometimes instead of always meeting up at parties and after parties for 2 AM booty-calls. I want to get you really really high and ask you if you love me and whatever you say, I’m going to push you down and make love to you just once instead of merely fucking because you won’t remember anything in the morning anyway

I really need you in my life. You make me not want to kill myself, and I wish you would go die sometimes so I wouldn’t have to deal with my feelings about you anymore. 

If you ever find this I’m going to be so embarrassed

Your abuse to my animals, the fact that they would have ""ran away"" after you would threaten to get rid of them.  The fact that you were so *nice* to everyone except your family.  The fact that you got rid of my dog I loved and still have the nerve to tell me that it wasn't your fault.   I can't forget or forgive.

That I can sit there and talk to you without confronting you sickens me.  Years of being told I'm not good enough is still echoing in my ears.

I wish the huge scar you gave me wasn't in a visible place because I hate lying to my friends when they ask me.  I hate you for making me think that things could be normal for me.  You left him because of what he did to us, whenever I got fed up, you said I was just like him, just like my father.  I hate that you would make me question whether I was in the wrong, if I was the one with the problem.  I was your daughter, I shouldn't have had to support you.   I didn't get a job so that I could pay the rent or pay all of the bills while you gambled and drank it away.  You spent more time obsessing over a man who you went on one date with than you would bother to consider me. 

It's been over a year since I made the decision to not speak to you and I *despise* you for forcing me to break that promise to myself.  You had no right to come into where I work and cause problems.  You have no right to withhold my belongings.

They say the more you experience in life

Life is like a canvas.
 

For me, and pain. I closed my doors, locked the windows, and shut the drapes. Sunlight unable to peek through.
 

I was safe. 

I was comfortable. 

But my canvas remained blank in my lonely house...

 
It's been some time since I've open my doors, I've been thinking of that more and more...
 

They say that you can't enjoy life if you don't experience happiness and suffer through the hurt. 

They say that if a wound is made

They say that you're not alone. 

 
But I feel alone. All the words in this world expressed doesn't help me feel less by myself.

Did I make the right decision?

Will I regret this?

I fear for what's to come...

Will there be a hole in the center of my piece? How long will it take me to repair that? With all the paint I slather on top.. will it make it go away? Or will the memories be here to stay forever? Is this madness?

Or am I just mad?
 

It's hard to make this ambiguous when my thoughts are only going down one path. Perhaps this is why it makes no sense. I'm unable to understand the circumstance anymore. 
 

I might not say it well and

I might end up taking too long

but I want you to hear it.

So

I always thought that it was just a dream

I never thought it could actually happen

What to do?

I'm probably not saying it well

Are you listening? 

Do you care?

Even if I can't say it well...

The important thing is the feeling I want to tell.

These are words

words that weren't carefully chosen.

but words that express these emotions.

It's not a beautiful confession.

It's not beautiful at all.

But that doesn't matter.

Just the one.

What I want us to be:

I want to become the most important person to you

to call you without reason

to text you

to share a cake and giving uneven amount of portions

but you just laugh and forgive me.

To hold hands without needing to say a single word?

You showed up at MY graduation party. I didn't know who you were. Your rotten little bastard children ran around destroying everything. You gathered in a group

Then you come to my aunt's birthday party, and purposely upset me, just to see how hard I can tic. Especially when I am forced to sit in the 90+degree heat because it's ""rude to sit in your a/c when we have guests..."" 

I suffered that day. My OCD raged. I had anxiety so bad that I ended up locking myself in my room and retching because your monster children upset me so bad. Tourettes, etc. IS NOT FUNNY! And not a thing to pick on!

I will get past that. Your children are bastards. Whatever. I hate kids as it is. 

But then we get to the food. There were about ~40 people at this picnic. My mother made about 60 hamburgers, 10 bags of chips, about 4 lbs worth of chicken kebobs, baked beans, etc.

We made enough food to feed twice the amount of people that were there. I barely got to eat. The birthday girl didn't get to eat at all.

*Why?* 

Because we saw what you did. You took the food off the table (seriously, (not counting the ones you took when my mom desperately made more trying to feed everyone) at least two bags of chips, half the chicken, and half the drinks. 

We saw you and your dirty little sausage monster children packing the food in your car before anybody even got a plate. We saw you taking stuff out of our fridge and packing it in your car. We saw your kids going to the car when they wanted a drink. We even caught your little cunt of a daughter sneaking into our kitchen

You are disgusting. I later found out you did this at my grad party. Stole food

You are filthy wastes of skin. Don't you ever come back or near my fucking family again. I had to go into my room and calm down because I was ticcing

I’m so overwhelmed with emotions

I would sit at my desk and… daydream of you as the mother of my children. The thought has never crossed my mind before; I’ve never assigned that role to someone in my life. I had never been with someone that I saw a future with. You’ve affected every single part of me. The things I thought I knew, it was more I didn’t know what I wanted. Well, I knew what I wanted – a wife, kids, a house, happily ever after. But that was just a child’s story, a picture with a sentence at the bottom. There was no plan

I don’t like not having a plan. I don’ t like not knowing what to do next.

I kept trying to put my emotions into a little box like I always do. Looking and analyzing all the end results and consequences. And when I thought of you and a future together, mapped out every possible outcome of us and only saw great things.  I thought about us living together, our first house, I’ve imagined a hundred different kitchens, and thousand different cabinets, what our future kids would look like, what they liked, our honeymoon

I love you

I will love you for the rest of my life.

I wish you had killed yourself long ago. I wish you died. I wish you never were my mother to begin with. I almost wish that I had never been born but that’s starting to come around because I see that I didn’t deserve to be beaten and abused. The screaming

Before some recent psychological breakthroughs, you were just fucking insane. Something should’ve killed you, stopped you. If there were a God you’d have been killed long ago by a billionaire drunk driver and our dads would all have full custody. You needed to be dead so that we wouldn’t be raised with still-born minds. Your living-death style of parenthood propagates itself. You are the corruption to be solved. The cancer that spreads throughout generations because you warp your progeny’s minds from birth. We were your house servants to be beaten if we disobeyed. It was never in my mind to kill you myself because you kept such a strong fear-based hold over my mind that I couldn’t think to disobey you, for to do so is to invite immediate suffering upon myself—your fists, and your horrifying rants declaring total ownership over us. Your fleeting, short pecks of affection only occurred when I gave you silent, unquestioning obedience. You disgust me. 

If you’re not going to die soon from organ failure due to your fluctuating cocktail of pharmaceuticals, you are a piece of shit, and now you need to clean the fuck up or just kill yourself already. You made us create elaborate psychological coping mechanisms just to deal with you!  

**JESUS FUCKING CHRIST. YOU FORCED THE SCARED

Perhaps you understand now why I don’t care when you say “I did my best

But maybe you’re just another iteration of the corruption, to realize that you were just a scared child too, trying to impress your masters with such well-behaved children. It didn’t matter that we were well-behaved out of fear of pain and abandonment, did it? Maybe you were just a warped child raising children in a warped way to please your warped masters. I fucking hope so, because to think that you’re just a naïve child raising children in a “fire-from-the-hip” type knee-jerk emotional way-- that would fucking enrage me. 
	
I’m trying to write you a dignified epitaph here
	
I don’t want to think that you were just a crazy bitch. I want to think there’s a deeper story to why you were so god-damned mean to us. To be able to look a young child in the face, honey, and I’d do absolutely anything for you, even my last breath to make you happy” to “GET OUT OF MY SIGHT YOU WORTHLESS PIECE OF SHIT!”-- that’s a special kind of fucked up. 	
	
Be careful with that “last breath” line, THAT YOU’LL BE A BETTER MOTHER TO YOUR KIDS, I will hold a mirror to you and reveal the nightmare you were to us, your children. It will horrify you, it will burn your eyes, and you will wish for death, and I won’t stop you. There is no salvation in words, because aside from all the broken promises
	
You’re an inspiration, until you cut yourself out of the fabric of living creatures here on earth, and leave the rest of us to heal, because even if I spent every day of the rest of my life drunk, high, and sedentary, I’d still be too good for you. You don’t deserve to celebrate my life and career successes as “your son”

Me, with sleeves and pants rolled up as far as possible, I had the instinctive feeling that you were something special. I don't mean that in a cliche-love-at-first-sight way - in fact, it was more of the opposite. Short hair, no make-up, shabby clothes, you were absolutely not my type. That's how I knew you were special

I did, as it didn't take me too long to realize you were the most beautiful girl I'd ever meet. So beautiful, in soul and appearance, that you did not fit into this world. There was really not a bad bone in your body; If you saw someone that you could help in any way - you did, easy as that. You didn't even think twice. Didn't matter who, didn't matter what, where or what you were doing. You simply wanted everybody to be happy, happiest I've ever witnessed - it reminded much of a child. You reminded much of a child in general. So innocent and pure

You were also selfless. Caring. Fearless. Calm. You were the one everyone went to for advice. You were the one taking burdens off of our shoulders, everything was going to be okay. You could just sit there, look up at me and listen, and the world would feel like a better place right away. 

But sometimes, dark sound resonating in the background. A sadness of no other. We all noticed it, we all knew that, despite your childlike personality, you were carrying the pain of an old soul. 

And there you were - picking up our burdens, and everyone could see it. Everybody could see it and no one did anything. It hurts so bad to think of the fact that had we just done something, you might still be with us. Everybody saw your clothes hang more loosely, everybody saw the rings underneath your eyes. Everybody must have noticed your bones protruding, and everybody knew you weren't eating solid foods any more. I'm still trying to comprehend the fact that you were dying right in front of us, and nobody even brought it up. 

I'm sorry I never told you how beautiful you were. It was so obvious, and not a single person returned the favour. I'm sorry nobody even thanked you, I'm sorry I didn't save you from your misery, and I'm sorry you died alone and scared. 

Two months, so that nobody would know how bad things were, because you always had to make us feel safe. Well, today I'm crying. I'm crying for my friend, my first true love, my guardian angel and my saviour. I'm crying, because life's not fair; I'm crying because the only one of us who always did good had to be the one who got struck down.

As the night went on and our friends dropped off one by one until it was only us though, you began to tell me the one thing you'd been holding back. I've never been so frightened or scared as when you told me about your abusive ex. You know me better than anyone, I rarely get upset. Listening to your story though, I was shaking with rage. It killed me knowing what had happened to you. As the night went on, you got more and more drunk and began trying to make some terrible decisions. I stopped you with the help of our mutual friend, and neither had our friend. Her and I talked and we agreed she would take you home for the night

You are the strongest, we promised to keep in touch more often, and we've done fairly well at that ever since. Ever since though, I've always had these feelings in the back of my mind and wonder what to do.

These are my honest, having my best friend by my side again. Do I continue to live the lie and never risk the amazing friendship that I have, or do I admit all of these feelings to you and hope for the one unanswered desire I've always had to be fulfilled?

It would have been so nice to have been able to have a decent relationship with you. We tried. We used to try to include you

First, well, that sucked. They chose to spend their time to be with us, rather than have their clothes smell like cigarettes and pot and cat piss. 

When you moved away during their formative years to be with your alcoholic boyfriend, with an empty refrigerator, so you could spend all your time at the bar? That sucked a lot. When you moved away, that ended, at least for the school year. We could feed them good food, and know they were actually making it to school. Getting help on their homework. 

But you really made up for it during the summer time, when you inconvenienced everyone so your underaged daughter could sleep with her 18 year old boyfriend? That's called facilitation. And it made me sick to my stomach. I wish you understood how hard it is for a girl to date when her mother treats every boyfriend she has as if he's the new son-in-law. It's so fucked up, but you keep doing it. The latest situation, we avoided it--but only because your daughter is more adult than you are, and can see reason. Thank god for that. 

I now wonder a lot if you secretly want her to get pregnant and be stuck in this town forever. If you want her to fail so that it will validate how much she is like you. 

You never attended parent-teacher conferences. You never went to  concerts. You never paid for a damn thing

 I used to go to the bar all the time, using it as evidence of what a great mom you were. I had to listen to people talk about what a great mom you had to be, because they knew you, and see you were so nice, and see, your kids were so polite and so smart--it must have been you who made them that way. Instead of their father, who didn't go to the bar, who didn't go to the bar either. We became invisible

When you told people how hard it was to be a single mom? That really made me laugh. If only you were a mom. If only you had enough self-reflection to realize you've been more like an older sister. If only you realized that living a college lifestyle for your whole life isn't a life. (Especially if you haven't been in college for 20 years.) 

Your kids truly are great kids. They are very smart. They will do well in life, and smiling and being friendly to you, when what I really want to do is choke the life out of you. 

I try to feel sorry for you. I try to let it go, because I don't want them to resent me, or think I'm trying too hard. Trying to hold back so they don't think I'm trying to replace you. I've loved them, and not been able to be the mom they needed. 

I do despise you. I long for the day when I won't want to punch you in the face as hard as I can.

I lost you on March 14, your personality, your smile...I imagine how you might have changed me, or how I might have raised you. How much your daddy would have loved you and welcomed you into this world. But the fact is, you have changed me and we both still love you very much. 

I have been told by family members and close friends that this was for the best. We were young, but it doesn't help when I can never experience what it would be like to be your mother. I miss you so very dearly. I wanted to hold you, feed you, comfort you when you're sick or sad, be your biggest fan, teach you things. I wanted to see your dad hold you and love you, play with you, they were gone in just a few hours. I still can't fully comprehend it. I will never have you back. 

So, and I'm really starting to feel happy with a very nice man. Wherever you are, I hope you're not upset. Can you even feel anger or sadness or happiness? Can you feel anything? That's what scares me, baby. I'm afraid that there really is nothing more for you. I never felt the need to believe in an afterlife until you died, but it's the last little bit of hope that I have - that you're living a better life somewhere else. I want to believe such a thing so badly. Either way, I should be happy. At least I know that wherever you are - if you're anywhere at all - you aren't feeling pain.

I'm glad it did though, and that it wasn't some drunken decision, and this is why:

After no kind of intimacy for roughly two years, barely any hugs and everything, I'd convinced myself I was better off alone and didn't need anyone else. But when you were laying in my bed afterwards, stroking my back, I felt.. happy. For the first time in 2 years, I felt safe and that perhaps life isn't just a piece of shit. I'd almost forgotten what it felt like to be truly happy, but thanks to you

To have someone in my arms in bed, maybe it was just you caught up in the moment, but the feeling I had when you drew my hand closer to you and gave the impression you wanted me closer, even though I don't think I could've been, is a feeling I'll never forget. I don't ever want it from my mind because if it goes, I'll be back to my old, cynical and pessimistic self again and I don't want that.

Your words I miss most of all. Oh yes, I remember staring into. I just want to touch you, not in a sexual way, and that would be alright. To touch your arm, so perfectly slim. I guess you're sensing my type here, but what can I do? Your energy, your love, almost as much as you
Oh god, stuck in a loop, with so many underscores of meaning in meaningless phrases. Our talks were amazing, perfect. I don't know about you, but for me they were. The flow, and how we managed it.

This is Steve. I'm the young man who temped at your workplace in the production department.

I'm not there anymore

I never tried to do anything to harm you. I never made a single desparaging remark about you - neither to your face nor behind your back. I was very appreciative of your suggestions you gave me during my first week of employment at Omni on how to increase my production numbers.

When Forge Industrial Staffing placed me at Omni, because I knew the production supervisor didn't make a name for himself there by firing as many people as he possibly could.

A couple of days before my last day working, I saw you talking to Wally, and immediately after your conversation he came to me and warned me not to attempt to reprogram the machines.

I told him the truth: I hadn't any idea how to program them, and let's not forget the danger associated with with them. I certainly didn't want to hurt myself or anyone else.

You, and you also didn't care about the safety of other people or the money it would cost to replace the parts you destroyed. Now that I think about it, you probably didn't like me for a couple of reasons. First, I don't leave my workstation unless I have to. I'm a full-grown man, so I am capable of holding in my piss. You seemed to have a big problem staying in one spot and taking care of your responsibilities. Second, I mind my own damn business. If I see someone being lazy, I don't stop production to walk over to them or anyone else to complain about it. You seemed to always be very interested in what other people were doing

If I were you, to put in a bad word about me to HR.

I told Wally about the tampering, so that the next time I went on break and came back and noticed they'd been tampered with I could fix them. Lunch time came, and when I returned I noticed the dials had been tampered with again. I fixed them, and when I turned around to grab an unfinished part I noticed you were watching me very intently, like you wanted to see what would happen next. So I showed you: I ran the part, and it came out with no incident. I measured the cuts and they were right on target. Then you stormed off to complain about something to someone instead of continuing work.

All I can say is I feel bad for the person you conned into sabotaging my machine for you.

Later that day the temp agency called me to inform me Omni didn't want me back the next day. I asked them why

I pity you. You know you can't make your way through the world by your own willpower, like a cockroach. That's what you are. I signed up for classes at the local community college so I don't have to live at the mercy of jackasses like you or ruthless production supervisors anymore. You're going to be driving to the same building day after day, and when you get there you will perform the same repetitive tasks moment after moment. I don't know where I'm going, but it has to be better than that. 

Have a great day.

I'm sorry to bother you, requiring your immediate attention..Its your son. I know where your son is.   He and his mother began renting a room from me this past summer, and in the beginning, everything was fine. He was a bit rambunctious, but I chalked it up to typical, 4 yr, old boy behavior. Then, or fourth time I awoke to find him standing next to my bed, don't get me wrong..that whole soul stealing thing is really cool, has no respect for his mom (or anyone else)

I discovered his affinity for animals one day when the dog came running into my bedroom, he said he and the dog were ""playing."" He was holding a plastic hatchet behind his back, and ""playing"" involved him chasing the dog, hatchet held high, swinging at the poor thing every few seconds. Another time, it was a golf club. I'm sure , like any good little son of Satan

I have heard him say things to his mom, and ""No, I tell YOU what to do"" are a few of my favorites. He says these things in a shrill, whiny voice that makes me want to shove knitting needles into my ears.  He barges into peoples rooms without knocking, runs out into the street in the middle of the night, saying that ""his mom says its ok"", and once, I caught him trying to hang from the flat screen TV mounted on the wall in their bedroom, demanding she open the door. If she says no, usually telling her to ""get off the toilet""

Now, are probably grinning from ear to ear, as the proud papa of a son who is a ""chip off the old block."" Well, congratulations. I'm sure he'll be ready to take over the family business in no time. SO, why not COME GET HIM!  Take his mom to court, and get full custody of your little Lucifer.  He belongs in an environment more suitable to his..um..personality type, where his evil would be nurtured and encouraged to grow to its full potential.

I love the way you never sat in your desk correctly, your adorable artwork (and the fact that you would always get mad at me for calling it ""adorable""), the way you run your fingers through your hair, the way you smile when you're proud of yourself but trying not to brag, the way you talk when you know what you're talking about, the way your eyes light up during certain conversations, your eyes in general, the way you slap your own forehead because the absurdity of people is just too much sometimes

I've fallen in love with you one word at a time, part of a song that gets stuck in my head. I'm so in love with you. I can't figure out how to get it across. It's all incoherent nonsense in my head but the big picture is so clear. We would be perfect for each other.

You used to tell me that I was your 'what-if' girl. The girl you fantasized about, even when I took off my shirt to show my awesome bra. You kissed me with such passion.

Then for the first few months we dated, class, outings with friends because the best thing was just to be together. So obvious that we didn't even think to say it. 

Remember when we spent that entire weekend together, but everytime one of us was supposed to leave we decided not to. I remember that I was wearing your pants and refused to take them off. You pulled at the bottoms as I pulled at the waistband and somehow you managed to have me upside down, supported only by a pair of pants. I remember laughing so hard, being so ecstatically happy that I didn't even think of anything other than that moment. As you know, a rarity for me.

I know it all went wrong soon after. For a year now, fights because we just don't have time for each other, fights because we want different things.

It makes sense that we're not together. I know it does. But I cannot help crying whenever I'm alone. I cannot help looking through our old fb conversations, I'm hurt. You are my true love, and I hate every moment that I know we're not together anymore.

You don't look anything like the man I married. I know that this seems vain and horrible, I look EXACTLY the same as when we met. You, when first I saw you, bore a striking resemblance to Chris Evans. Now you look an awful lot more like Chris Farley. You used to work out at least a few times a week. Now you sometimes go weeks without leaving the house. You've gained over 100 pounds. I understand that we were in our early 20's when we met, and a man's metabolism slows down later in life. But that doesn't mean that this extra 100 makes sense. It's all because you rarely move from your chair in front of the computer. Sometimes you are there when I go to work, still there when I get home, still there when I go to bed, (except the days when it's FOUR!)
Now let's get into your non-existent sex drive. To be fair, you just shut me down with ""You're pressuring me, and that makes it worse."". Okay, I get that. But if it were really some sort of physical or mental issue that was stopping you, you wouldn't masturbate so many times a week. I know you think I don't know, but I do. And do you ever stop to think of how that makes me feel? You can still get it up, just not for me. You can still have urges
  
Next up: I work, I have worked. Full time plus. While you have sat on your ass at home, occasionally doing some housework, and cried about how you have it so tough. And now you are going back to school. For a degree that you cannot get a job in. You are a felon. You will NEVER be allowed to work in your field. You are a schizophrenic. You will NEVER be allowed to work in your field. You haven't held a job for over 14 months in the last 11 years, and the bullshit jobs you have had have always ended because you walked off angry or got in a fight. And of course the fights were NEVER your fault. The whole fucking world is out to get you, because you are smarter than them, better than them, to top off this ice cream sundae, in the cheapest possible rental situation

This is not angry nor is it a confession to a crime so I'm posting this here. 

I have a girlfriend, but I can't. Everything in me thinks she's the perfect girl, like the one I'm supposed to be with. I'm not even a guy who's really into the whole idea of destiny, but everything in me feels like she and I are supposed to be together. 

I tell her these things sometimes, I don't know if she really believes me or not, but I mean those things 100 percent. It isn't even a slight exaggeration. I would die for this girl without a 2nd thought because I value her more than I value myself. (Which is something I can't honestly say about anybody else in my life.) 

The idea of losing her is devastating to me, and it feels wonderful.

I guess I should tell you more specifically about her. She's 16, and these large gorgeous emerald eyes. She has a sweet, soft voice, but a big laugh, one that's loud and infectious. She's a sweetheart in every way you could think of, she's thoughtful, and considerate, and knows how to say the most affectionate and sweet thing possible. I think this must be because it comes naturally to her

She's the kind of girl who thinks a lot with her heart, if we have a debate about something for example, she'll actually get fired up about it. This makes her very loving as well, I feel like I'm truly cared for, and loved by her. It's a great feeling. She's also perfect at romance, I honestly don't know how she does it, but she puts Nick Cassavetes flicks to shame. 

Other than being this wonderful, individual she also has qualities that me me rationally want to be with her. She's ambitious, and hard working, she's talented and artistic. She paints incredible paintings that I think should be in galleries. Removing all of my feelings for her I still think she's insanely talented, it isn't just me being nice because she's my girlfriend, no, she is a highly intelligent, and artistic individual.  

Okay, but not in detail, it isn't really explainable in detail, at least not by me, maybe someone with better language skills could explain it in detail :d. The point is that I want to be with this girl forever, I want to spend my life with her, I want to have kids with her one day, and most likely won't be getting married for at least a few years, she's the one for me

Periods of time like this, and start to forget about you. But today needed to hand off that thing to you, and I thought I would feel fine, if not happy to see you. Then I see you and everything floods back, I put on a smile and play along.

You know as I was flying at 50+ mph through the air after getting flung off my motorcycle, and to be honest at that moment I was kind of happy, I was living a bitter yet sweet lie. That bitter sweet nostalgia of being with you. Even though knowing that once college starts you'll be gone once again, out living it up to your own standards of what college is all about. You were the one thing on my mind as I was mid flight, I wanted to see you again. How badly did I want to hug you for one last time and tell you good bye. Then upon landing, tumbling about for another 40 feet through the oncoming lane it turned out that I was alive, and that life keeps going on

I hate how you treat my feelings for you as almost a tragedy, hell I wasn't counting on anything else, I just wanted to see you, and you didn't even give a damn, didn't care enough to even ask how I was doing.

I feel used a little bit, cause I always tried being there for you, and even if it's not the case I now feel that you knowing that I still care about you, needed me as a filler and someone to be there for you. I was happy to be there for you. 

You know what sucks? One day feeling loved and feeling wanted

Although those times are drowned out by negative events/feelings, it's the bad stuff that tends to stand out eh? 

I know you'll read this one day when you'll get curious as to how I am doing, the last half a year was hell that I don't want to live through again. Please stay out of my life once and for all. Maybe years down the road, we'll see each other among a busy crowd, smile and it'll be cool to see each other after all that time, we'll get coffee catch up a little, and continue living our separate lives.

When we first were together you told me I was perfect, you decided I was less than perfect. You became frustrated with me, and started picking at my insecurities. You told me everything that was wrong with me and my body and face.. You cut me deeper than I've been cut in a long time. You started hurting me physically, too. It's been more than once and you don't even pretend to be sorry you did it anymore. You just tell me how it was my fault, how I was asking for it, and how I could have prevented the injury. You're sorry that I got hurt while you were pushing, shaking, shoving






I'm at war with myself. On one part of my brain, I see me trying to fix myself and help out, and be a better girlfriend, and it gets discounted. You get mad at me for the same stuff you do, and you're so judgemental, I'm afraid you may get hurt if you fall off your high horse.







I'm not sexually satisfied, but good god, you and I, when we work, we work perfectly. We can go so far together. I want to hold out for therapy and see if it gets better, but darling, I can't. I'm going to end up committing suicide if I stay with you






You are my sweetest, my greatest weakness. The man who's made me cry the most, and who's saved me. The man who throws me to the floor, tell me its my fault you did it and my fault that it hurt me, only to tend to my wounds later, wrecked with guilt, and having me tell you that its okay, you were right. Oh, do you? You've always had such a healthy self esteem.






Well, I was being abused then and it was ignored and I'm being abused now, and I'm ignoring it.




I love you is not enough, harder than anything I have ever done. I feel like a failure, and that I'm walking away from the best thing that has ever happened to me... But you're also the worst and I can't fix you.

I'm writing to tell myself I did everything I could to make sure that we worked out. And this is all for the absurdly short time we went out.

But I know that you never really were that interested. You held back, was when you told me you didn't have the right kinds of feelings. I should have known. I should have known because I've done the same. I've been on the other side of this conversation, and if the girl I told what you told me had emailed me telling me how much pain she was in, and to take her back? I'd be freaked out.

I was happy with you. I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. A reason to hope again. I saw a girl I could be with, like I was coming home after a long trip. I gave myself to you, and I didn't hold back.

I want to ask you then, if you still never felt right with me. You said you were happy with me, but also extremely anxious. I had that same feeling. I was anxious that you were going to back out at any time. I was anxious about not seeing you, or about seeing you. I was anxious when we talked about our what we were, or when I texted you the wrong thing, or when anything happened aside from sitting next to you, holding your hand. Or walking with you and your friends. I was anxious that it would end.

But when I held you in my arms, everything was right in the world. It felt natural, as if everything were finally coming together.

I had a crush on your friend, to make me happy. 

I never went ahead and asked out your friend. Something was telling me not to.

When I scored the lead in the school musical, I know, but I remember catching your eye as I began to sing the most cheesy romantic line. I realised, oh shit, I think I just fell in love with Aidan Dawnley.

We went to the cinema the week after as friends. The rest was history. 

We looked a right pair - you had long hair, 'but Rach... he has longer hair than you!' 

That was the week that the RE department set up the prayer room. Everyone had to write secret prayers. I'm an athiest

That was 14 months ago, you didn't want anyone to make a fuss. You gave your hair to that hospital because they were the ones who gave you that life saving heart surgery when you were a few weeks old.

You've been the perfect boyfriend, surprise presents, and letting me drag you round the girliest shops. I remember when you got me a pokemon game for Valentines Day - you opened a game and caught 3 pokemon, and you named them 'I' 'love' and 'you'. I saved them in a special file.

You've told me that you wanted to be with me for the rest of your life, when I was done with uni. I cried so much when I heard that you needed heart surgery. You can't imagine the feeling I got when I got the phone call from your mum, saying that the surgery was 3 hours too long and she had no idea what was happening.

We’ve been friends for a year now. You are the only person that knows I lie constantly. You are the only person that can calm me down during anxiety attacks. You walk with me home every day. I told you my secrets

(I forgive you for not having more fucked-up secrets than I do.)

Are we going to college together? In San Francisco? Share an apartment, rant about how our heads hurt and banter with each other?

Then are we going to go around Europe and study history? We’re history nerds. You love the way cultures interacted and spread and travelled. I like the folklore, dirt and bricks—architecture. Taste the sweet wines of France and take sips of strong beer from Germany, tour old cathedrals and sit at benches staring at red tulips and freeze our assess off in Sweden?

You’ll probably look for IKEA first

I guess my point is, recalling earlier that I was complaining about it?

Shakespeare was a literary genius. Except for the Romeo and Juliet (I liked Hamlet better) — no one falls in love in first sight. I know I didn’t.

I fell in love with you. Did you mean this to happen? I hated you. You know people and now you’ve twisted my reasoning

What did you mean by making yourself so close to me — then tried to get closer? Not as a brother

I hope that I won’t be crushed to pieces because I let a deceptively manipulative fucker like you get to me. I was perfectly fine before you waltzed in and figured me out

I’d like you to be mine for a longer while. You already have me.

We act like a couple. We talk like a couple. We joke around like a couple. We cared for each other like a couple. The ONLY reason we are NOT a couple is because you do not want children, invited our mutual friends out, made sure that everyone could come to an event that YOU suggested we do, only to have you at the last minute bail on everyone. I went out of my way to ensure it would be a surprise, too. I went out of my way on my ONLY day off to ensure you would have fresh cupcakes for the event. I went out of my way planning for you so you could have a day to remember, since none of your other friends could bother to do a nice thing for you on your birthday. And what do I get in return? Not even a god damn message saying you wont be there to attend.

Half way through the night, and yet still all of my messages go unresponded. You tell her that (although it is quickly approaching) it is not currently your birthday, and that you have no interest in attending any event. That you have no idea why I, the very same woman that has done nothing but gone out of my way for you since the very beginning, would bother to do such a thing. Oh, and we mustn't forget how you told her how you HATE birthdays, that you despise anything to do with birthdays, to spend time with you and make it special

1350541843.0,11of2d,I went to the swings tonight ...,I_am_athrowway_OBVI,22,4,10,"I let the wind dry my hair today. I drove with the windows down and wore cut off jeans and more of my skin was open to the air then has been since the last time I saw you here. I was emptying the dishwasher and my hair was still wet from a swim. You came to my door wearing blue and we matched all day

It’s October now; Indian Summer

I played that album today. I was driving a car with a sound system as good as yours and I turned up the bass. When we saw this band you changed your shirt in the middle of the concert floor and folded your polo into a cargo pocket. We danced the whole night and the lump in your pocket ricocheted between us.

I walked to the park tonight. I walked by the fence where I’d examined your face for the scar you were explaining. You flipped over your bike handles when you were a kid. The concrete was stained red with blood that had to be bleached away. The scar was nearly identical to my own
	
I went to the swings tonight. I swung, but no, you’d rather be miserable than stupid. 
	
I walked home tonight and I used only the left sidewalk. I passed the shadow of the maple leaves splayed on the ground from the streetlights above. I’d stopped you there, life, and you agreed, and we walked on. 

On other days I walked the right sidewalk. I saved the retracing of our steps. You’d taken shorter steps for my shorter legs. I’d brushed your arm with mine. We’d walked diagonal across the intersection because it was always the middle of the night when we came there, pale hands curved around the edges of your sleeves. The first time you couldn’t decide whether to tuck or untuck your shirt. It was sky blue; it buttoned down. You’d pushed the long sleeves carelessly above your elbows and when you first walked through the door I caught the outline of the muscle in your forearm and watched it all night as it flexed and released each time you stretched a hand to grasp or gesture.
	
I came home tonight. I sat at my desk and I talked to someone else. He is nice. He is cute. He’s at work and you are on vacation, living your life. He is attentive and close and he always initiates contact first. 
	
He draws. He has a good job. He’s loyal and steady and ready for me. He loves to fix cars and he builds jet engines for a living and he humors my love of baseball.  He says he’d take the garbage out for me. 

He failed high school English. He didn’t go to college. I had to define the word bereft for him. 
	
You are incapable of acknowledging that you are most likely smarter than I am. Your humor goes like lightning from silly to salacious. You smile when I use a particularly beautiful word. I know in your head you’re putting parentheses around it (salacious) like we used to do when we’d talk into the early morning hours from two different states and two different lives and two different crises. You open doors for me because you’re polite and because you know I like it. The only tattoo you’d ever want to get is the symbol of the Deathly Hallows hidden away on your ankle just to say you have it. 
	
And though we’ve made no promises to each other I compare every one to you: the brown belt you always wear and the slightly curved set of your shoulders, the real one, that takes up half your face completely unrestrained by your usual decorum. 

The last time we met it was on your ground and you showed me all you could of your favorite place in the world: paintings, pride. You told me the history as we walked away the afternoon. I was absorbed by the quantity, arrested by the grace. You watched me. And I felt that smile, your whole body beaming. 

We spent our day together and most of our night and we sang to each other on the car ride to my hotel. It was four in the morning. I hadn’t slept the day before

Snow will have fallen by then. I will have led someone even further on. He will flirt with me and I will humor him and feel guilty and continue with the sport that distracts while I’m counting the days.

You will have taken exams and taught classes and entered applications for graduate school and had a few conversations with me that

I will have written things that I am proud of and read things that changed me. I will have spoken to people and taught children and gone to plays and visited friends. I will have fought back anxiety and embraced days that, to break eye contact, to let that feeling go before asking what it means. 

I ache after the best version of myself: agile

What kind of human being instigates a relationship with someone who is away from home and who's wife is 6 months pregnant. Of all the people that you could have found to cheat on your husband with WHY did the only other married one in the group have to be your victim. 
We were having problems and you took advantage of that.What made you think you had the right to make demands on him? to convince him I was a horrible selfish person who didn't care about him? You ruined my pregnancy. He was confused and scared of the future and rather then break off your relationship when you saw it wasn't going as planed you lead him on thinking he still had a chance with you.. thinking i was still bad. He brought me to a lawyer fresh out of the hospital to appease you.
It was too late... you had found someone else but just like with your husband you didn't have the guts to tell the person that it was over. You waited until that extra month of damage could be done. waited until AFTER our child was born 

I think about you all the time

You contacted him when your new boytoy fell through and he told you it wasn't happening. how did that make you feel? You think he is going to fall for your tricks again? yea sure hang out as friends you fucking slut.

Days like today make me wonder if the world is ending. It's dark out, listless, uninterested, tired rain. Rain that doesn't care if it falls forever and ever and ever. It's also hot. It's hard to move because of this oppressive, wet hot heat, and there's no sun, and tired rain whispering sorrows and spitting old bitterness all over the glistening pavement.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZVvjXJentik

This song feels like today.

I like songs like this. It sounds like the crying of metal. 

It's hard for me to listen to music and not feel inundated by strong

I think of a fever red sun rising despondently over  burned out

I think of the groaning of defeated steel, a drowning ship, singing out it's last melancholies, it's defeat, it's testament to the inevitable failures and mournings of mankind as it fades from reach forever. 

I think of boneyards of man in the days after man is no more

You play your music, with unencumbered vibrance, and you're so different then me; I just stare vacantly into my sad and everlasting flashes of hopelessness while you vibrate with life.

I can't ever love you. I don't understand your fascination with me. It makes me think you are childish. It makes me think you're naive. 

You look at me with those unearthly green eyes, but you...I watch the heroic battle that your optimism fights against those unsightly hints at reality, and you wash the worry away and pretend like it's all going to be ok, and that what I've just said or done is reasonable, and that you can make sense of this wrecking ball of miserly discontent beside you.

I fade out

You cry out your declarations of adoration. I tell you to stop, I just think it's painful.

Stop. You can't possibly ""love"" me; the notion is absurd. You don't know me, a possibility. Your reverence for me is misguided. I am not your modern angel. I am a fucked up abyss of all that is rancid and deceptive and incurable. You only know the face on the outside that's a thin veneer above the teeming mass of putrefaction inside of me. 

I will never love you. Your devotion to simplicity exhausts me. Your boundless optimism bores me. 

I admire you,

and I wanted to tell you right then that I can never feel for you how you feel for me, because I can't bear to cause you pain, because I don't want to kill that sparkling, optimistic, hopeful, pure, and untarnished spirit,

and I was ready

and then the connection was lost.

But it's here.

I know that you are about to hurt so badly

I know that what you know is not real...you haven't even met me. I know that you're going to be hurt by this impending severance

Soon, and have never loved you.

I'm sorry.

 (I know. I'm not funny. I know.)

when I go back all those months ago to the root of it

Simple truth is you've occupied my thoughts for a long time. Pretty much since I first met you. You know that scene in the godfather where Al Pacino looks at the Sicilian girl and she makes a face like he just stabbed her in the gut? well, slowly I'm letting go of my delusions. After all, I don't know you. I don't know if you're worthy of a letter all to yourself when there are real people in my life I love like the dickens, people I should be writing this about. But you've occupied far too much of my free thinking time to be ignored, so lets just dive in.

It was the little things. The way you would half smile got me for a really long time. Someone would be laughing at something and I'd catch myself picturing it. Your ever so slightly balding hair, it was a good change. You were smart, put together; you were funny, and it's hard to make me laugh. I made a point to memorize your face the second time I saw you, because the first encounter was the first time in awhile I had wanted to take a chance on anything, and it was to know you.

Not just fuck you

I don't know where all those little things went wrong. I could detail the events, I really am completely out of my damned mind. Such an attempt would be me muttering to myself in the dark hours of the morning, instead of saying the things that need saying.

So on to the apologies. I'm sorry about all the drinking. I'm sorry about the brashness and the black outs, and I'm sorry I was a walking stereotype of everything that's wrong with my gender. I'm sorry about the awkward nickname, the stupid texts, I'm sorry about this stupid irrelevant letter. I'm sorry I can't talk to you, it's just the mix of my embarrassment and (albeit diminishing, it really has been a long time) shame surrounding you creates a feeling strongly akin to vomiting up all my innards.

These are apologies for you

There was a night where in passing we talked about love. If a drug could simulate love then how real can love be? well, destiny, purpose, I did believe. They're just too good of ideas to not try and imitate, to not spend at least a little bit of your life searching and yearning for. Six months later and a lot has happened, I don't much see the credence in lying to oneself anymore, but I don't know if I could let myself apologize for trying. And with you it felt like that movie love. The kind that lights everything up and absorbs you completely in the very idea of itself

Despite what little it was, just know that for a small period of time you made a girl literally crazy over you. Confidence booster, amiright?

Also I am no longer expending my bandwidth on your various social medias.

Now of course I would love to be in a relationship with you. Ironically, believes that I should be this extremely self-conscious guy who tries to act all macho.

But every now and then, working in silence and subversion, quietly ushering in a better world. That must be our war, our religion, and our path. Our army will come from all walks of life because we improve all walks of life. 

This is why I know the world will one day be perfect. Not in my life time, one mind at a time, discreetly moving to pull the carpet out from under everything that is evil and wrong. But until that day, we have to maintain the charade, we have to protect ourselves, we have to do wrong. But we must never forget right from wrong, and we must never forget that the evil is just a mask, the vision that I know you so desperately want.

And that is why I fear I will never meet you. I may never see you without the mask, I'm okay with that. And I know you are too. Because we don't need each other. We know that this path, this vision, requires subtly. Requires discretion. Us meeting may have to be a sacrifice we have to make for the greater good, and I'm okay with that, in the name of ensuring that someday, in the far future, people can just be themselves

Even though we arn't together any more

When I tried to message you a few years ago, that isn't all of it. Seeing you happy without me, it hurt me. I was told that I needed to remove you from my list by the girl I was seeing, so I did, and I didn't have the courage to tell you myself. 

I was afraid of what you would say to me if I told you. Then you found out from said girl that I had removed you, between the two of us, deserve to be happy.

I'm also sorry that I never told you how proud I was of you. You showed more courage by moving there than anyone I have ever known. I admire you for it

I know that our seperation was mutual, to find someone new and now your married with a beautiful daughter. I tried so hard to move on from you, but truely I just cannot. 

When I close my eyes I can still feel your heartbeat against my chest. I can still hear your laugh, dream of the things I lost. 

I still remember our first real date in the park near our college. I remember proposing to you with a ring from a bubble machine because you taught me it was the sentiment that counts. I still remember you on the bridge outside the art center when I asked you that question in the falling snow. You made me so happy

You made me want to be a better person, my writing, my very existance, was bettered by your love. Nothing I could ever do would be enough to repay you for that. 

I still wear the ring you gave me on a chain around my neck. It's the last thing that I have left of us, and honestly I don't believe I will again.

If you were to show up at my door tomorrow I would drop everything to be with you again. However, and I understand that. I do want to be friends again, my life was so much better when I could call you my friend. I want to be able to be there for you if you need someone to talk to. 

I am writing this, I will love you there as well.

These are some of the things I've always wanted to say to you


Remember when I was little and I said that I was raped? Then I took it back and said I was lying? Why didn't you investigate it further? I was nine. Nine year olds don't make that shit up. You know it, after me, right? I went to you as a child, your child, in a time of great need and you dismissed me, coldly.

When K2's dad found out what Curtis was doing to me and Kama and made me tell Dad, just so you know, I did lie. He didn't only molest me and force me to give him head, he raped me. I was too scared to say then... But I don't think you would have responded well, anyway.


C told you about Ellis way before I did. I think you thought she was lying too. When I told you what he was doing to me, and masturbated right next to me. And you knew. You knew the whole time and did nothing. I asked again if I could tell on him yet and you said no. Only when he did it again and I told C and she told R and Ellis was so ganged up on that he finally confessed did you let me turn him in. Even then you seemed angry about it. So, it's okay for him to molest your daughters until he confesses? Why?


When I was 16 I told you I was dating a 32 year old man and was addicted to meth (this part's for you guys not in the letter: I've broken up with the 32 year old and I'll be clean two years may 13th). You didn't believe me. I only weighed 100 lbs at the time (and I'm 5'7 for you guys again).



When I reported Kalvin, you didn't seem supportive and, once again, thought I was lying until two other victims came forward for Kalvin, Robert was already suspected of pedophilia by family members, and Pride was already a registered sex offender who focused on teenage girls.

And now, I've known him for five years, been close for two, why would I randomly make this up now? Just to send my baby sister into a depression and ruin the life of a boy I considered to be my baby brother?



My entire life you've chosen the men who sexually assaulted me over me, and ignore it. Do you have any idea how much this fucked with my head? How much resentment it built? You say you love me, but you don't. You can't if you're willing to let people sexually assault me and shame me when I come forward. You love the men who raped and molested me more, at least that's what your actions say. You never even called this time to see what happened or show concern for me.



I'm more depressed and alone than I have ever been in my entire life. Dad is literally the only person I have left. I think about suicide every day



I'm moving as soon as the lease ends at my place and I'm not giving you the address or going back to [my county] again. I'm done. You guys can have the dude that assaults people in their sleep. Even if you guys eventually decided I wasn't lying, if all of what happened to me, happened to you and no one wanted to save you and called you a liar every time and you got no hugs, no I'm sorry this happened to you, but a lot of ""you're over reacting"" ""just get over it"" and ""it didn't happen anyway"" what would you do? How would you feel? It's no fucking wonder I'm so fucked up and was such a shitty teen.


I don't understand your choices as a mother or a person. And all of this comes from the woman who ""hates"" sex offenders. But only when they sex offend someone other than your daughters, or they're totally innocent men and you just have daughters who like to make false sexual assault claims for fun. I can't wrap my head around your thought process at all. If I had a nine year old that had told me she was raped, I would take her to the fucking hospital or a therapist and assure her she was safe and believed until I got to the bottom of it. You... didn't.


I don't really know how to end this

There are so many reasons you can’t die. I couldn’t even begin listing them all, as much as it hurts to say it.

I think I fell in love with you the first time I met you and I can’t even remember when that was. My first really clear memory about you is from a few weeks or a few months before I got to go to my first SOLAR event. I remember we used to LARP in Hickory by the airport. V:tM and Werewolf

I remember Channie and I got into a heated argument because we were both moonstruck madly in love with you. We argued over who could have you

I remember you breaking both of our hearts when you instantly fell for the Twins at that event. I remember giving you my bed

When I think about our friendship it is a lot of disjointed memories

The craziness of the Mutants and Masterminds game. I remember Chris Poe, but it was really fun none the less.

Then I remember you being gone. You moved in with Millie again and then you got married and then you joined the army and you became this person that I used to know.  I ignored the message you sent me on face book when I invited you to my wedding because I saw it just as I was leaving for work that day and I forgot about it.

I didn’t realize how much I miss you. My brain didn’t connect yesterday when Alex told me that you’d been hurt and you were being air lifted  away. I was sick and I just went on with my life

I put off calling him for another half hour because I wasn’t sure if I could make it knowing how bad you might be doing. But not knowing is a lot worse. Yes

I start tearing up every time someone asks me if I am okay. I am not okay. I am not going to be okay.  It is this horrible hole in my chest knowing that you will die. I have known and loved you for a lifetime already

So you’re not allowed to die. I am completely, and get better. Because I don’t know what to do in a world where my friends can die.

I loved her like family. She was one of a few people, and spoke freely and frankly. She understood me like no other did. When others saw a misfit troublemaker who refused to go to school, she saw independence and intelligence. As corny as it is, she believed in me when I could not.

If I could go back in time and never meet you, that you and your friend started talking to me on the bus, would go so differently. Because it was Halloween, your friend was dressed up like one of my favorite cartoon characters. I wanted to take a picture for my good friend F, who loves that show too. I asked you to take the picture. I thought nothing of it at first. 

Then when I saw you again in the dining hall, where you were alone. We talked, and ended up exchanging numbers. I felt high. I had successfully pulled off a conversation with a guy and he hadn’t hurt me or ridiculed me. 

Then, spur-of-the-moment, to go to the ballroom dancing club’s meeting. We danced, and I started to doubt myself. Then, another night, we met and talked for a few hours. I opened up and let you in a little more than I would anyone normally. I doubted more, but I told myself it was fine. We held hands, it felt wrong. My hand didn’t fit in yours

I hated your texts, and how you felt a connection to me. I didn’t believe it. I knew you were sincere, but I think you were blinded by the same light I was: being paid attention to by someone for the first time. I knew you were wrong, but you thought you were right.

Then I visited your dorm and met your roommate, and it was so messy I thought I’d suffocate. I’m not even a neat freak, but that amount of mess turned me off. You walked me to the bus; we held hands, and I leaned against you. I went back to my university while you stayed at yours.

Then the shit hit the fan for me. I ignored your texts and calls for two days. This wasn’t just for you; don’t go thinking you’re special or anything. I dropped off the grid and didn’t talk to anyone on my phone, you tracked me down, stalked me to my own dorm, got someone to let you in, came up to my floor, and asked my friends where I was. Oh, after you had already done that earlier in the day. I’m glad I hadn’t been there

I’ll admit

M, not to see you, but to see N, A and R. We met up with them and went for a dip in the lake. It was so cold, and so clear, I remember it sharply. I felt the shots at this point, since I had drank straight out of the vodka bottle at N’s room. We went back to your dorm, and it was one I’d seen before (and even at .1% BAC
I ran into you in the hall. I remember what I said; you changed the story. You said I told you I was “fearing for my safety” in A’s room. You liar. I told you I’d had too much and needed a place to detox for a while. I went to your room and threw up for two hours. I give you credit

I remember my friend V calling me, but I didn’t fall asleep. I stayed awake and listened to you talk to your roommate about me. You said I was special. You told him that I’d told you that he deserved someone better than me (which I had) and that you weren’t going to let me go because of some self-depreciating thought.

Excuse me? You weren’t going to *let* me go? Like you owned me

But the worst part came at around 6:45 in the morning. No alcohol hangover. Just the emotional one. I’d fucked up, watching tv, and I wanted to get on the bus back to my school. But, oh no, you just couldn’t *let me go*, could you? No, instead of letting me call me sober roommate for a ride, mad at me because of you.

The next day, and explain, but I refused because as far as I’m concerned, you didn’t deserve anymore explanation than “I don’t feel the same way.” Cliché? Maybe, but it worked. You told me about your suicide attempt. Why’d you do that? We;d known each other for less than a month, and you felt that it was right, on the verge of a break-up, I’ll off myself”? You didn’t do it; I’ve seen you twice since then. It’s a good thing I’m a shallow

But all that, call me a bitch; I don’t care. That’s what it was and is. Your personality is great. But the fact that you don’t take care of your body repulses me. Honestly, fat repulses me. It’s disgusting, and do you know why I react this way? It’s because I used to be you. I used to be the fat one that no one ever paid attention to, ever talked to or made friends with. 

And maybe I was taking that out on you, by potential friends and romantics alike. Maybe I just let my college friends tell me the bad things about you, and I choked down the good things. Maybe I let them push me to ditch you. Or maybe it’s simply the fact that I don’t want any reminders of the days when I was fat, the days when I was alone, and no one wanted to talk to me or be my friend. the days when I thought I was so much better and more important than I ever was or am.

So if I could go back in time, and think about my birthday, think about my life, think about my friends, my family, fuck, anything else. But I would not look round


And that would be for the best.

On my drive home I was rushing to write all of this down. Something struck me and I was compelled to write all of this down and thought you should know about it. I think it goes a bit like this:

Sometimes people get comfortable. Sometimes people get too comfortable. Comfortable with things they typically wouldn’t want for themselves, thus creating a crucial facet of their lives. Be it a bad habit, a resentful idea of a living space, a peer group you feel nothing for, a sour relationship, or a job you hate, people get comfortable. However

People don’t just get comfortable, yet few follow through. It’s the risk. To pursue these things we need to risk that which we already have. It’s the fear. Not just the fear of losing this risk, not just the fear of losing that which has made us comfortable, but the fear of losing that which has kept us alive.

Survival is our greatest instinctual inclination. Surely it has several competitors running closely behind, accept a living space we do not truly want, mislead those we know aren’t our friends with hollow words and skin-deep smiles, justify our lackluster relationships, and conform to our mundane occupations because they are yet to kill us.

I had done absolutely nothing to you but profess my love and adoration for you. You responded by writing that my love and dedication to you felt like a burden and only annoyed you.

I remember every single god damned time I professed my love to you, but never enough to give me a direct answer. Never enough to tell me your true feelings, that you have no feelings left for me. But just to be safe, you would never go far enough to give me the satisfaction of receiving your love. You would only say just enough, and as vague as vague could possibly get, to give me hope and lead me on. Don't you dare deny it, because you have admitted it to me yourself in one of your forgotten moments that you only do this to keep me around for your own cruel and selfish pleasure.

This time, I don't want you to come back. I want nothing to do with you, you Cunt I HATE you. You killed the most precious thing in the world, and that is love, understanding, and devotion. You may go through relationships throughout your life, and you are always used to me sitting around waiting, pathetic little kid who has a stupid crush. A dumb guy who you can walk all over like a door mat.

That security is gone. You are alone once again. You can see whomever you please, ""no matter what, just remember that someone loves you.""
 
I will truly never know how you feel about me deep down inside. You are always telling me some sort of distorted truth. Now, and I cannot keep torturing myself like this. I just cannot go an entire lifetime suffering like this anymore.

Don't expect me to wish you Happy Birthday every year, or cuddle up next to you and rest my hand on your breast.
 
Don't expect me to answer your calls every time and listen to your problems or what's going on with your life. Don't look forward to anything from me anymore. And please understand

It's that time of year again where you make the journey back home for a visit.  It is so nice to see you, games of Words With Friends, and other things we do at a distance to make sure we stay connected.

When you do get to come back home, because I know it will only make you feel sad and there is nothing that can be done.  You live 3,400 miles away, have a career, and a husband.

It is also take-your-breath-away painful that I can't be that aunt to your children all of the time.  I just get to be this cool friend once a week every summer.  Believe me, but the truth is, I never forget - it just hurts too bad.  It is just a reminder of how far away you are and how long I have to wait to see you again, only to make sure I maintain a calculated and cautious distance.

I hope you have a safe flight back.  I love you very much.  You're so much fun.  I love it that we just pick up where we left off the second you arrive into town.  Thank you for spending all of your hard-earned vacation with us. It meant so much to mom and dad that ALL four of us were back at the same time - the first time in 10 years.  That time went so fast, and so funny.  You haven't even flown away yet and I miss you already with every fiber of my being.  I hope to see you sooner than later.

I spilled my soul out to you. I broke my rule and opened up. I cut a huge wound in my chest

You made me a giddy little girl when you said yes. I smiled the widest I ever had in public right then and there. You just laughed and smiled right back at my happiness.
Was it all just to make me happy?

I couldn't even keep you for a whole day. That night you replied to my email. You said your mind was betraying you already. That you had commitment issues. But you promised. 
You said weather it be as a soul sister or soul mate that you'd love me no matter what. But that your self-hating side was winning the battle.

And now. We're still best friends. I never feared losing our friendship. Our souls are synched and we both know that. 
What I feared was losing your love. 
You never told me what side won. But you've made it quite clear anyhow. 
I can't even touch you anymore without you shrugging away or flinching at my hand. Why. I know you can tell it hurts me. That every aversion is a direct stab to my heart. But yet you continue.

I know I'm not perfect. I'm so far from it. I'm not healthy and you're aware of that. You accept me despite all of my fucked up tendencies and cynical introverted personality.

But I love you so much. I need you in so many ways.

I think the worst thing is. I can't stop it. I'll watch you avoid my touch. I'll listen to you gush about cute girls. I'll let you hurt me again and again and I'll never stop. I can't stop. 
So I'm a masochist. Does that affect my current situation? Probably. But no matter how bad you hurt me I'm still perfectly loyal and devoted to you emotionally.

I'd follow you into hell. I'd burn for eternity. I'd fight by your side. And I'd sacrifice my very mind

It's been three weeks since I last saw you, albeit, you confused me quite a bit.

You were my match.  You were my perfection, craved your touch. 

When you finally kissed me three days later, cradled my face in your hands, bit my lower lip....

I fell in love with your laugh, sweet, funny, caring, cuddly, intelligent man.  I fell in love with the way you'd position me when we slept....my arms wrapped around you, my head on your chest, your hand resting on the curve of my hip.  You would wake me up in the morning with a smile and you'd lean down and kiss the end of my nose

You changed one day, shut down.    No longer did you bid me goodbye with a long kiss and a whisper in my ear of something in Russian.  No longer did you reach out to me to pull me close, just to catch a whiff of the perfume on my neck. 

I was going to tell you that week that I fell in love with you.   I was going to tell you how I felt inside.  I was going to tell you that I felt like you were a piece of my soul that had been missing all these years.

You shattered that all away.  You backed away, every moment we spent together.....you said we were friends the whole time.

Bullshit.

I reluctantly went to you a week later.   To shut the door on ""us"".  It was tense, yet....when I walk in, you act like nothing happened.  

I was standing in your kitchen, buried your face in my hair, and whispered something in my ear in Russian.  Fuck you.  You dropped me, don't try to reconcile.

We were outside, running your fingertips down my arms.    I am fighting tears, and you can see it, yet you don't stop. You know your touch is a drug to me.   Fuck you.  You didn't want me anymore.  

We are inside, and grab my hand.  You twirl my hair in your fingers, pull me in to lean on your chest, you kiss the back of my head.  You know I am crying, my tears spill down my cheeks.  Fuck you.   I wasn't good enough for you anymore.

You are over concerned with my physical well being, a glass of water, and a back rub.   Fuck you.  You have no regard for my feelings for you.

You won't let me leave

I finally am at the door.   You pull me into you and bury your face in my neck, breathing in my perfume for two minutes straight.  You have my face in your hands, and I'm fighting tears.    Fuck you.  I fell in love with you and you, so easily, discarded me...pushed me away, and flat out told me you didn't want a relationship with me.   

You were someone I saw myself with forever.  You were someone I wanted children with.  You were someone I would have given up everything for.  You were someone who filled me with so much joy and peace.......yet I was someone you so easily tossed aside.   

I will not play your games.   I will not be subject to your fickle attitude. I will not be sucked in by you.    I fell in love with you, because obviously I meant nothing to you.

Update

He did read this, basically. Is this something I can deal with long-term? I don't know, because I don't know how much of my reactions right now are based on my psych meds and/or birth control. I'm personally doing a lot better, which leads me to think that perhaps the past week or so of me getting upset at every. single. damn. thing. was just a temporary thing. Hopefully, anyway. It's something I'll mention to my psychiatrist next time I see him, certainly.

But I can't move on.  I'm too old and I've seen true happiness with you.  We were so alike and loved all the same things that in order for me to completely forget you I feel I have to completely change who I am.  I was happy with myself before you.  I was happier with you.  Now what?  Do I change who I am in order to move on with my life?  I can't separate hundreds of thousands of Lego to give you back what's yours.  I can't stop wanting to be a part of what makes me happy without wanting to share it with you.  Every second of my day something happens and I think how I'd love to tell you about it.  Every time my email or phone lights up

I need to find a way to be happy with myself again, cute, important, learned, sweet, and thought provoking things again.  I couldn't have put on paper, if someone asked, all the ways you made my life a joyful experience.  I couldn't have picked someone better to share my life because your life was very much the same.

But in the end it wasn't, and too young.  The love we had, the plans we made, the life we could have celebrated wasn't enough to overcome the idea that you weren't done living on your own.  It was more important to you to stand alone than live with me.  And I know that means you've found someone else and you want to explore that.  If that's the honest reason, I wish you'd have told me.  I trust you, and if all you wanted to do was be on your own, then I wish you well.

But I have to tell you, they understand.  If you asked me in six months you'd get the same answer.  If you asked in 6 years, I'll still be here.  I know I treated you well and I loved you unconditionally.  I celebrated your flaws and strengths equally.  I gave you the understanding you needed to grow and survive.  I know you loved me with everything you were.  You didn't ask anything of me other than affection.  You saw the inner geek and loved me for it.  I know together we were amazing.  I know that I won't find someone your equal again.  I'm old enough to know this, and I'm old enough to be patient.

Fighting helped me feel better when I wanted to smash the world. Fighting kept Sam and I safe when the principle stood by and the let the kids sexually harass us.

I know, and sore muscles, but I feel my best at the gym. Everyone's kind there, we can all respect each other, and I don't feel the subconscious need to look over my shoulder every two minutes.

Another reason: I'm getting/might be hurt.

My response: Mom

Remember A and the soccer net? How he wouldn't listen to the teachers

Remember M? How he tried to hurt Sammy? How he had a whole crowd of kids jeering him on to hit my defenseless sister?

I remember. I got bruised

That was where I was SUPPOSED to be safe. How the teachers would always be watching

I felt safer at the gym than I did in that hell-hole, and taught A a damn good lesson on when people snap.

It's also shown me that I don't need to fear those who try and act bigger. I'm learning to hit harder.

Reason 3: It's not girly.

My response: This ties into #1. ""Should a 14 year old girl really be doing this?"" Yes. Yes. Yes. Hell yes.

Being ""Girly, I have to do that, I have to please him, I have to be skinnier than her.

I'm going into High School, where my boundaries won't be respected, or someone wants to try and attack me?

Being girly is not one specific thing. Yeah, by me and for me.

To sum this up:

I was not put here to try and kiss up to people,"" 8 times in the hallway.

I don't need to please a boy to prove my worth as a person

I learned Krav Maga because I was tired of being walked all over

It's not ""Pretty, ""Feminine,"" whatever that's supposed to mean, but it is me, my life, and my want to protect myself, my family

I have not had so much fun being myself since I've met you.


Yet. I feel as if I'm about to make a mistake.



When I met you, too bad. You lose, your beautiful. 



I had heard this story multiple times throughout my life by guys. I was one of the few who went out of his way in highschool to be friendzoned. I didn't do it intentionally at the begining. After a while though



I saw you. 9.5. Dancer. Prep. I didn't get my hopes up.



After a while of hearing the guys run their gums raw



You were still training



I kept at it. I spent my breaks talking...then my Lunches. I slowly realized that my attempt to bitch nab you



I had to settle this. I went to work



You never texted. I had won. I invited a friend over to hang out. We played video games that I sucked at. Then I got a text. 



""Are we still good for today?""



I stared at it for a solid ten seconds before the white noise in my head let my friends voice filter in. 



We went out for Coffee.



I have never met a girl that could hold a conversation with me about anything and keep engaged. And best of all, and you laughed at my jokes.




I went home. And pounded out a song on my laptop. (background: I'm a DJ and a electronic producer. No genre limit.) That was months ago



We began to talk more




I...began to have feelings. Which I hated. It was always so much fun to talk about how silly the idea of marriage was




Then...came trust.



Not telling me about trying to kiss my best friend. Even if you were drunk. I don't know why you didn't say anything. 



I trusted you.



Making out with a complete incompetent asshole that all the girls had to push off them. All of them had drugs

You had nothing in your system. And you made out with him. At my apartment. We all could hear. You said nothing

I trusted you.

My best friend flirts with you constantly

I trusted you.


...I get a phone call from my best friend. We have a shot. We are getting flown to New York City for a shot with several record labels. We have till the end of this month. If it works out. We will be making music for a living. They will pay for us to move to L.A. And that will be our job...


You texted my best friend. You said that you didn't want to do anything with him
My best friend

How can I trust you?

You haven't trusted me.

And the worst thing? I feel like you have begun to trust me. I feel as if you are beginning to develop feelings for me. Which is what I've wanted.

Yet, she just wanted a fling to begin with, but now the chances are sealed that she won't see me again...

I hope this is not true


I can't be with someone who can't trust me. And so far she hasn't shown that enough to out weigh the reasons why I can't trust her.

Regardless of trust

You are one of the most talented people I know. I am guilty of leading conversations towards dancing countless times just to see the lights behind your eyes as you remember choreography

I wish you could of seen my face my roommates told me that you were a 7.5 and not their type. My jaw dropped in confusion

You are beautiful. Not just personality. Your body distracts me constantly. I had to memorize your eye color if somebody asked. I'd have to make this forum NSFW if I wanted to continue so MOVING ON!

The exact moment I realized I had lost the battle against my heart was when I was teaching you guitar in my room and that entire time. Not a single sarcastic remark was made. It was...real.

And I still have the paper in my desk that you wrote when you finally beat me at Mario Kart 64. Not that you needed the paper after my roommates saw it.

I had writers block for a while

When I got you to run with me up in the mountains as dusk fell on the valley. And how you managed to keep up with me. I swear I wasn't staring at your ass...for that long. COUGH! What?

I'm not in love with you. I'm logical and realistic enough to know that. I do have feelings for you though. As long as your happy I will be happy. Even if there is some sadness mixed in there sometimes. 

I might have problems trusting you


I want you to prove that I can trust you with my feelings.

1369916572.0,1fbywk,Letter to ______,to_my_best_friend,16,0,0,"Dear ____

You don't have to invite me to your wedding. It was so nice of you but really

I can't do that anymore. I'm afraid I'd ruin it a little bit just by being there. I'd be there and what's inside of me would seep out. I know people can see it. It has nothing to do with your wedding. It's just me. 

I can still be happy sometimes. But it never lasts. It's so brief. There's no escaping this. It owns me. If I was at your wedding I'd have to try really hard to show I'm happy for you even though I definitely am. It's like I'm drowning. 

The only conclusion I can make is I'm rotten inside. 

I left school because I had to. It has been nine years

It's possible part of my spirit is gone now. I don't doubt that at all. Every time I talk to someone I pretend so hard to be normal. Every smile I make is to hide a grimace. I'm hurting. 

Part of me thinks you already know that and have always known that. 

I still think of you as my best friend. I wish I could tell you this but I can't. I have tried to get better for years. There's nothing inside me anymore except sadness. It has never ended. 

I'm scared.

I really want to end my life but it's not an option and it's frustrating. Finishing college is an option, getting a career is an option, doing amazing  things is an option, growing old is an option. Everything is an option. 

I'd spoil it all. If I did it all I'd be pretending to be normal the whole way. 

I know it's true. I know that even if I go somewhere absolutely blissful looking

I look at the Maldives and it's beautiful

I'd want to be *there* but I wouldn't want to be *here*

I took care of a baby for a long time and I know what I thought about when the baby wasn't there. I thought about fucking killing myself. 

I loved that baby. He was all I had. Even he didn't want me to be sad. It breaks my heart because I already have seen disappointment on his face when he saw how sad I was once. He wanted me to be happy. He was such a happy baby. 

The future is just trying to find ways to keep the sadness at bay. A little less painful. I will never truly be happy. If I meet someone and they can make me happy it won't last. I don't like that the happiness will only exist because of them. I want that happiness but what happens if they don't want me anymore because I get sad? They will be gone and so will the happiness and the sadness will be even more intense. And I know if they're gone I know for sure it's because they think something's fucking wrong with me. 

I just don't want to do anything anymore. I disappoint myself. I don't like being this way.  

I didn't even want to talk to you. If I died at fifteen it would have put a nice cap on this all. Stop it before it went too far. 

You asked me what I want to do with my life. The answer is nothing. I don't have anything inside of me. Nothing but the fucking sadness. 

I still try. I still hope. But I don't know if it's realistic. I'll still try to find out while wanting to give up the whole time. 

Every day has been a nightmare. It's a day to day thing and I'm tired of it. I go up then come crashing down. 

Suicide is too complicated. If I killed myself

I can live with this but it hurts. 

I still hope. I do. I just can't stand disappointing myself. Which is all the time.  

Going to your wedding would be too hard. I don't know if you're inviting _____ but if you are

She tried to keep me safe. She tried to help me. Do you even know what she did for me? 

Fuck. 

You should have married her. 

She understood me

That's when I know I just don't have it in me. Some people can make me happy but they're not going to always be around. There are only a couple things that make me happy. I don't even remember what the fuck they are. 

This letter is fucking sad. Fuck. I'd never be able to tell you any of this. You can't help me now and I'm tired of pretending. I know it's been four years but I can let you go again. I'm sorry. It's the best way. Don't worry about me. There's nothing you can do. I just wanted to say hi. You didn't have to give a shit.

I know others would call it an infatuation ... an obsession. At best a preoccupation or crush.

But I know I haven't gone a day since meeting you that I haven't smiled thinking of you. I know every time I see you my heart leaps from my chest. I know your laughter rings in my ears for days after I hear it.

I know we made our distance. I know we made our choice

I'm glad I love her and you love him. And we're happy with our others ... and we're happy with our lives. But I can't help that there are vast tracks of real estate in my heart with your name on all the signposts. Long horizons where we run to each other .. and we run and we run ... but it's all just horizon.

I can't help that we're halted by everything from our past.

So what is this? What is this stone I work over in my mind and polish with hope. How many smiles and hugs and nervous long looks must I endure? How much chit chat

I hate it. I hate the guilt

I just want my heart not to be torn.

And maybe we never shared a thing. Maybe this burden I bear holds all this horrible weight for no one but me. I am frozen. My tongue

I am chained and can't strip from myself this hope ... this nebulous want. I don't even know exactly what I want from this ... from you ... I can't bring myself to unfold this desire. I can't finish this sentence because I already know how it ends.

My honor

I get it. You're broken. I'm broken. You're involved. I'm married.

I can't believe myself.  I must have a kind of fixation

I've been playing this internal game for months now, the more I realized how utterly in sync we are.  There's this kind of electricity that just brings me to life when I'm around you.  Something that stems from the fact that you keep me on my toes, meeting my own wit with your own and still managing to keep me smiling and surprised despite my own unpredictability.

I'm transfixed.  I'm utterly blown away.  And I don't know what to do.

First

When the excuse disappeared, spend more time together.  I'm just wondering if I waited too long.  If maybe my spontaneity, my absurdity, my caution in acting killed any chance I had.  So naturally I had to think of a grand gesture, something really show-y.  Something creative, something unique, something that would, make it quite clear exactly how important you are to me.

Lady, throughout the 'doing' of the work, you were on my mind.  I envisioned all the potential ways you'd react to every little thing, and imagined myself the conductor of a grand symphony only meant specifically for you.

Well, crafting absurdity like a master clockmaker feverishly setting the cogs of his greatest timepiece.

A weaker man would have given up long ago.  Probably a smarter man, the sense of deep reflection, the unspoken communication.  There's something that just keeps you on my mind, makes my chest swell, makes me come alive.

I feel that, and fallen hard, without sounding like some sort of head case.  Maybe just enough to describe how I haven't felt this strongly about someone in a long time, and haven't felt this kind of subconscious magnetism in even longer.  
(Wouldn't use the 'L' word

But I haven't been able to get that chance, so I'm not wiling away the hours simply pining for you in despair...  But I do wish I could have one evening, just you and I, in which I could finish the symphony I started with one final flourish and find out once and for all if I've just been on a fool's errand all this time.

One night, too intelligent, too witty, too hilarious, too lovely of a person for me to allow to enter and leave my life so quickly.  I don't want to regret not being able to say something for the rest of my life.

It's funny in a cosmic way, one on one, with the understanding that I won't be hurt should my intentions be misaligned with any potential for the future.  I just simply want to express myself and find out where I stand, nothing more, nothing less.

I also want to do something stupid and impulsive and kiss you when you least expect it

Lady

A lot.

I know people say this a lot when relationships end

I was your first date, but it was still love... a kind of love I hadn't felt in over two years. I loved your shy awkwardness, your geeky hobbies - everything about you I found so adorable. I was enamored by you. You were so utterly good to me.

Then, which was fun. I thought the ""distance"" apart would make me excited to see you again when we would spend lazy days in. But for some reason, it didn't. I grew sick of always asking you to come up with other things to do. It was always me thinking of things. Apparently, this was hard for you to do. 

So hard

I did not deserve this. Like I mentioned before, you are not at all mature enough for a serious relationship. 

As angry as I am at you, I can't help but think what you're doing at this very moment. You're probably having fun with your friends - I know you will be tomorrow, at least. I doubt you've even thought of me. If you have, you've probably thought of how glad you are to be rid of me. I bet you're not even the least bit affected by this.

(Single initial letters are my 2 other sisters

Hi.
 
So I've heard good things about your recovery (I'll believe it when I see it). In any case, and what I hope happens is you don't relapse immediately because you're weak to peer pressure and kind of a moron at times (actually, probably all the time), I figured you finally deserve a dip into my thoughts.
 
Let's cut to the chase here, some might dismiss at as sibling rivalry thing, but man, I couldn't have disliked you anymore. I don't think I've felt any sort of ounce of love towards you at all. I tried. But failed. I never even wanted to touch you or make eye contact. I feel like I need to shower if I do.
 
And as we went along, believe it or not, but you were my example of what true evil was, for the longest time, but then I realized after a while you're just not very smart. There was absolutely nothing I could do to allow me to give you any sort of respect because you'd piss it all away the second I thought you were getting better.
 
I gave up on you incredibly early. Like, I immediately knew we were in it for a very long haul. Drugs were spoke of. Alcohol was found under beds. Money (THAT WAS GIVEN TO ME BY MY GRANDPARENTS) would be stolen out of my own bedroom.(I still don't know who it was, but remember, I am a pessimist with a very good streak of winning guesses. This does not stack well to your favor). I would be forced to eavesdrop on terrible conversations you and L would have. How you hated our loving parents who never gave up on you. How much money you spent on drugs. How drunk you got last night. It wasn't fun, knowing your sisters were obvious whores. I knew this was the beginning of the end. And throughout the whole time, I was right. Correct. Right in every way. I'd assume you would do or did something horrible, and I was right. I hated being right. I grew up to become pessimistic, I felt satisfaction. I LIKED it. I grew up to hate. Hate everything. Assume everybody was out to get me. I assume I'm on everyone's bad side
 
God, you would've been in prison a long time ago, and possibly fucking dead. Dead. They are amazing people for putting up with a shit-bird like you. I wanted you out of the house since I was in grade school. I don't think I've had hate for a person like I did for you. And I don't think I will again. You're a real over-achiever, kiddo.
 
You know what were the worst days of my life? Helping you and L move into your apartments. You got to move out on our parents budget simply because you're such an obnoxious shithead
 
My friends apparently have you and L added on Facebook for whatever insane reason. Probably because they like the whore-thing you do all the time. Actually, and ask about why you both put such provocative pictures. Actually, I don't know if you had, I'm just blatantly assuming again and hoping I'm wrong, but L definitely has, as she seems to be the star of the show during these embarrassing conversations, and they literally had to remove her because how sickening her profile pictures were. They made my friends sick. Sick. And I immediately assumed you were doing the same thing. That’s how bad I've gotten.
 
I remember when Mom told me you were having an unexpected pregnancy. You know what my reaction was? I laughed. Who would laugh at that? A pessimist who was right. Again. An unwanted pregnancy. Surprise. Not really. I laughed. I was right again. My brain reacted normally to something I was naturally right about. Same thing with L. I laughed. Mom cried. Felt like shit afterwards. Now your child is here. I laughed at my nephew's birth. I'm a monster.
 
Speaking of Mom, and pretend there's nothing wrong, as per usual. He can try to hide it, but his heart and blood pressure can't. And everyday at their house, that fist-hole impressed into the closet door reminds me that he is hurting too. And I want to cry. The happiest guy I know, crushed by his own daughter.
 
Am I making you angry? Good. It feels like that's the only motivation I can give you. I want you to get mad. I want you to prove me fucking wrong. I want you to make me look stupid. I want to see your child put everything behind him when he's older, but I also want a Dodge Charger but that doesn't mean I know it's going to happen.
 
This is pretty negative, and had no real way to tell you how I felt. You and L have both been a major cause to my depression, and I don't want to tell anybody that, but I feel like this message is the only way to start improving myself. Pent up anger turns into depression. My parents, and S are basically the only people in this shitty world that I feel really care for me. And you've back-stabbed them more times then I've blinked in my life.
 
You want advice from me? I really don't know what. But I can try.
 
- Drop the shitbird boyfriend. He ruined you further then you know
 
- Keep up the rehab. Find a job
 
- Stay away from men in general until you find a new group of friends to be around that doesn't involve the following: Drugs, prosistution, smoking/doing drugs while pregnant and selling heroine to kids. Try dating an actual nerd. I know we're not tanned Jersey Shore alphas who love to party but you'd be amazed on how not shitty we are.
 
- Remember this message, and prove me wrong. I don't want to be right anymore. I want to be the asshole for a change. Please.
 
That's everything. Frame this on your wall. Show it to your friends. I don't care. I just hope you have the attention-span to read it.
 
In short
 
I'm not going to really give you another chance, or speak to me about this because I will deny it. Talk to Mom about it if you want (id prefer you didn’t because it'd upset her), but this is probably the last time for the rest of your life you'll hear anything extensively from me. I'm sorry I can't be a 'better' sibling, but my wounds are too grave for me to trust you any further.

Shit just got real. You really must not understand who you are fucking with. Let me list the things that I hate about you. 

You are an alcoholic. A lazy, but you should probably get a god damned job.

This is the first time I have lived on my own. Not with my parents, or I didn't mop the floor enough, I didn't use enough bleach in the bathroom. Cleaning does not mean making the house sterile. I'm not going to mop the floor for an hour just because that's some arbitrary time that you have decided upon. I'm going to mop it until it's clean. And normal person clean, not ""I'm planning on having a dinner party on the floor"" clean. 

You need to get a fucking job. You are going to jeopardize my very first real life adult thing that I have ever done. And if it fails because you want to be a party boy, or get the fuck out of my house. 

You need to learn how to respect people. Just trying to be happy and positive all the time does not mean that you know how to respect people. You have been a real asshole to the woman who is basically my sister. And that is no longer sitting well with me, but now that I know the truth about how two-faced you are, I'm not going to be Miss Nice-xteneritasx anymore. Now I'm going to tell it how it is, and I'm going to tell it to your face. Only, I'm an adult and I know that I need to calm down and try to not be an angry bitch before I talk to someone. Unlike you, I'm going to take 24 hours to cool down before I start talking the talk. I mean, you really have no right to be angry in the first place. 

In short: Shape the fuck up

I thought we could be friends afterwards. And so we wavered back and forth between you talking to me and you never wanting to speak to me again. The thing that hurts is that I have no idea what it is that makes you never want to speak to me. I know that we're just friends and I know that being friends with you makes it harder for me to stop loving you. But the fact remains that I do still love you. I still love you. Like moons love the planets they circle around

But when you cut me out like a goddamned tumor and you have the nerve to email me that you never want to speak to me again, that I wasn't good enough for you. It feels like I'm letting you stomp all over my heart again. The same way that when we were dating, you'd suddenly lose your temper, say mean things, and then stomp all over my heart. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough, that I was never good enough, that I could never ever do the right thing. 

You used to tell me that you knew me so well. I never felt the same way for you. Because sometimes you'd be the most amazing, brilliant person I have met. At other times, your temper gets set off by something innocuous and I am left to deal with the aftermath. I don't feel like I ever really knew you.

You tell me that because I don't show my emotions, because I don't let them control me, because I bury them deep down and stop thinking about them and hope they go away, I don't feel. I don't hurt the way you do. 

Tell me: do you hurt now? Do you hurt the way I hurt? Are you happy now? Are you happier now that I still cry myself to sleep sometimes? That being alone feels so unbearably hard and lonely? Do you understand now?

1375285244.0,1jfd7s,It's been so long since we spoke,tossaway1984,16,1,8,"It's been over 10 years since we met.  You were the first new person that I met on the first day of my senior year of high school.  Me, bubbly, in my head thinking of you as a preppy girl who was having cruel fun with a goth kid.  We kinda sat in silence for a moment before you blurted out that you thought I was really hot.  I grinned and said ""Thanks

Instead you became my best friend.  We grew close really quickly.  You would always call out to me in the hallway.  You made a point of yelling to me during a pep rally and waving furiously

While whining about yet another girl that had made me upset, where each other fit into those plans.  We talked about music.  I introduced you to punk rock like The Ramones and The Misfits.  I introduced you to metal like Slipknot and System of a Down.  You integrated it into yourself and found your own tastes in music that I liked.

Do you remember Valentine’s Day?  When you opened a bag of Hershey Kisses, you were so unbelievably beautiful) girl in my life that loved me as much as I loved her.

Do you remember prom?  You were so gorgeous.  I had never seen a girl look so angelic and amazing.  I was in awe at how lovely you were.  You were smiling so brightly.  My mom and your mom were both weeping.  I felt like I was on top of the world.  We waited too late to get a limo so we had a big Cadillac sedan.  Our driver treated us like royalty.  We got to prom and *we hated it*.  Everyone we hated in school was there.  Everyone that we liked was elsewhere.  The music was terrible, we were happy to be there together and able to make fun of it all together.  We called our driver and she drove us around downtown for about an hour.  Up and down the streets in the moonlight.  We kissed.  We held hands.  She drove us to your work where we went in and had pie and talked to your coworkers.  When our time was up, she drove us to your house were you changed into comfy clothes and then we went back to my house where we got in bed together and snuggled.  I remember you lying on your stomach and I gently rubbed your backside until we both fell asleep.  It couldn’t have been a more magical night for me.

We used to snuggle a lot in my bed.  My parents had split up and my dad was at work a lot of the time so we had the house to ourselves.  We used to snuggle and kiss.  We used to walk around naked

Do you remember the first time you told me that you were in love with me?  I’ll never forget.  We were in my bed (clothed this time) and you said you had to leave.  I held on to you and didn’t want you to go.  It was late and I understood but I wanted you to stay.  You sat down and started to cry.  I was confused, wanting to hear it but not wanting to force you.  You finally, in the dark room lit only by faint moonlight, looked into my eyes and told me you were in love with me.  I couldn’t have been happier.  I gently stroked your cheek and told you I was in love with you too.  We kissed the most gentle, passionate kiss either of us had ever experienced.  You breathed a sigh of relief and I walked you out to your car and we kissed in the moonlight again…deeply, passionately.

I loved being with you.  I loved “us”.  I loved the way you would wait outside my classes for me.  You would rush out of your class to meet me at mine.  I would come out and you would be waiting.  Your eyes sparkling and your hand outstretched

You were always afraid that you weren’t enough for me.  You remarked several times, ever wanted to leave you.

Towards the end of my senior year, these things were inconsequential requests that I shouldn’t have fought so hard against.

The end of the summer came quicker than we expected.  I got a job at a big name store.  You used to come and visit me when you could.  I loved being able to tell people you were my girlfriend. People were always a bit shocked that me, by outward appearances, was nothing like me.  We thought it was funny.  Soon after, I started my college classes at a local college.  It meant we would see each other less.  You were afraid I would leave you for a hot college girl, which couldn’t have been farther from the truth.  I did my best to reassure you that I would never do that.  I flat turned down girls that invited me over to “study”.  You started back to high school for your senior year.  We only got to see each other a few times a week because of our schedules.  It bothered me but I believed in us.

One night you called me when I was off work and at my best friend’s house up the street from my own.  You said you had something important to talk to me about and you were on your way.  I could tell by the sound of your voice that something was wrong.  I was sick with worry.  I walked home

Our phone calls became less frequent.  You stopped returning my calls when I would call from work.  Sometimes I would sit and call multiple times in a row

While this was going on, I said that I did (which wasn’t untrue, I did find her attractive).  She was more my “type” socially.  We started talking on the phone.  She was telling me to break it off with you and be with her.  This went on for weeks while my contact with you was sporadic.  She visited me at work.  I craved your attention but you didn’t seem to have time for me.  Eventually, between the lack of contact between you and I and her prodding, I decided to break it off with you.  I called you and finally got a hold of you.  I made it quick and said that the lack of contact was more than I could take and we were over.  You sounded like someone had just punched you in the throat.  I could hear the pain in your voice.  It broke my heart to hear you like that.  I picked her up and we went to a restaurant and ate.  My best friend came and sat with us.  After I dropped her off at home, my friend and I went somewhere else and talked.  We talked over things between you and I and I eventually reached the decision that I needed you.  I didn’t need her, I needed you.  I had only felt that what I had done was right because I was hurting and wanted to feel needed again.

I called you the next day from work and spilled my guts.  You screamed at me, which I understood.  We agreed to make more time for each other.

Things were magic again.  We were spending time together again.  Things were just like they used to be.  We went places together and spent all our free time together.  We laughed

Then it all started again.  The phone calls stopped, you turned to walk away.  I grabbed your arm gently and you spun around and looked into my eyes.  I knew something was wrong.  I asked you if we could go somewhere and talk.  You said, coldly, that you were working and you couldn’t but that you would call me when you got off work and we would talk.  I could see in your eyes and hear in your voice that something was badly wrong.  I was shaking.

I went home and, literally. I was sent home about an hour before you were due off work.  I called my best friend and he met me at my house.  We said nothing and I waited for your call.  Finally it came.  I answered and we greeted each other.  I went to my bedroom so we could talk.  You told me that things were over.  That you weren’t happy anymore.  I was distraught.  I sat quietly while you told me that you had been talking to that guy from out of town and that because of the way things had become between us that you felt you needed a change.  I begged you not to leave me.  I literally cried and begged you.  But you had made your decision.  I turned the phone over to my friend and let him talk to you.  I was too upset to talk anymore.  He tried his best to talk you out of it.  He knew how much I loved you and how badly I needed you.  I had went back to my bedroom and was sitting on the edge of my bed, hoping for good news.  He came in finally and without speaking a word, I knew that he wasn’t successful.  He held out his arms and I stood up and collapsed in hysterical bawling.  I stood, being hugged/held up by my best friend while I cried my eyes out.  I was devastated.  The one girl I loved more than anyone or anything was gone.

I called you back, my friend went home.  I was left alone in my house and I cried myself to sleep.

What happened?  Why did you decide to leave me?  You never gave me a good fucking answer!  I begged you to stay.  I was on my hands and knees begging you to stay with me.  I needed you.  Other than my best male friend

I started dating that girl that I left you for again a few months later.  We were together for 3 years.  I lost my virginity to her.  But she was never able to take your place.  Inside me grew resentment and an anger that I took out on her.  We didn’t fight a lot but when we did, not her.  I cried myself to sleep many nights because you were gone from my life.

I tried to move on the best I could.  We would come into your work now and then.  I loved the restaurant you worked at (to this day I can’t eat at one without thinking of you) so we went there

You emailed me once a few months after we broke up.  We exchanged a few pleasant emails and that was all.  After that

It’s been 7 years now since I heard from you.  I’m married now.  I have 2 other wonderful children with my wife.  Our relationship isn’t perfect but we do the best we can.  I still think about you.  I still miss you.  In those 7 years since I heard from you, all the old feelings are going to come back and possibly mess things up with my wife.  I’ve done enough in that department with her, I can’t do it anymore.

I try not to think about you.  I try hard.  Every few months, I feel better.  And I’ll be ok for a few months.  But then it starts to creep up inside me.  I’ll feel little twinges of pain in my heart.  Soon I’ll be thinking of you for days on end.  I’ll be dreaming of you.  And then I’ll find myself, again, sitting somewhere alone, crying.

I know that you never forget your first true love.  I know that you can never love someone as fiercely and deeply as that first person that you fall head over heels in love with.  But I somehow thought that after all these years that I would be over you.  And I’m not.  I still love you so fucking much.  I’m not naïve enough to believe that things would work with us now.  I don’t think they could.  I’ve changed a lot.  I’m not a goth kid anymore.  I dress how you wanted me to.  I’m in management at my company now and dressing differently doesn’t really fly in my chosen industry.  I’m a very far left liberal and an atheist.  I wasn’t atheist in high school.  We used to talk religion.  You were very confused about religion and I was trying to bring you to Christianity

I wish I had answers.  I wish I knew what happened.  I miss you.  I love you.  My heart has never mended.  I still have a black hole in my heart where your love used to be.  It’s a painful hole.  Sometimes I can push it down but it always comes back.  It’s a hole that spawns an anger born from pain.  I’m an angry person.  I really try not to be but I am.  I’m angry that I hurt you.  I’m angry that I miss you as much as I do.  I’m angry that

I hope your life is wonderful.  I really, tiny comfort that you’re happy in your life.

You couldn't keep money if it was tied to the end of your dick. I bailed you out of so much debt, you paid for you to enjoy yourself.

And I KNOW it was you who was feeding them information about my premature birth, never even once laid eyes on, beyond a photograph. 

You said I'm a bully. I'd like to know who I'm supposed to have bullied. Who I'm supposed to have manipulated. You knew me best

4.

I probably could have fallen in love with you. I don't understand why you would side with the others. I did nothing to you. I did nothing to them.

You took everyone else's word

5.
And you. Everyone knows you're a pathological liar

Shame on you. That's all I have to say. I am never letting you back into my life. I know better than to trust anything you say.

And 6.
You were like my brother. You were the closest male friend I had

You knew me so well

Out of all of their nastiness, and you never once asked me if any of what they was saying was true, you just took it as fact, and publically called me out, and when I tried to defend myself and others stepped in, you called them my ""cheerleaders"" and my ""reinforcements"" like I'd hired them to help me out. 

They were people who genuinely wanted to speak up for me. They were people who were doing the job you should have been doing for me against the others. Yet you didn't.

*ALL of you, for you. I never spoke a single bad word against you, even when you were constantly harassing me. I never sent out stories of my own, to get my own back, I just sat back and took your horrible lies. If I was a bad person back then, I had no idea, but I'm deeply sorry.

We both knew going into it that it was eventually going to end and I accepted that from the beginning.  But fuck me if you didn't do it in the rudest most upsetting way possible.  We were never a ""thing"" I realize that

You were my first hand hold, how shy I was, how willing to do anything I was.  You could tell I was inexperienced and that if you needed someone to fulfill you physically I would be there in a heart-beat.  At one point I questioned wether or not you were using me, you denied it, but now that everything has ended and the dust has settled I can see how right I really was.

Do you remember that night?  No of course not.  You called me completely drunk begging me to come over.  You kept texting me that you were naked.  Being a horny guy I was over there faster than my now rational self is willing to admit.  You were right

You knew I was a virgin.  You knew how much shit I had gotten from people back home about not being relationship savvy.  This was supposed to be a big deal for me.  But this was wrong.  It all felt wrong.  I don't usually tend to bring up religion but I felt an overwhelming message from God or whatever higher power there is that this was completely and utterly the erroneous thing to be doing.

You were drunk, we always stopped before we did.  Yet for about 10 seconds I think it's safe to say I could be considered a rapist.  I was just sliding my penis into a drunken shell of in-cohesive physical want.  And it was disgusting.  I pulled you off of me and you laid there begging me to finish you off.  I left before you even did on your own.  The next morning you called and had no recollection of what had happened the night before.  Good.

I know I did the right thing.  But I am so confused and jumbled up about so many things.  I guess I'm not technically a virgin anymore, have any fun with it.  Opportunities with girls don't come around often for me, it still seems crazy to me that you even initially approached me that semester ago.  So I don't know if I'll ever get the chance to be a part of someone else's life again.  In the long run things don't look good.  I realize this, and then I think that I should've capitalized on the opportunity that I did have.  

Sometimes I'll be in class or just lying in bed and I'll think, and I want to stop but the thought won't go away.  You didn't remember what happened the day after, I could've just kept going and you wouldn't have even known.  It would've been so easy to do so many things to you, I fantasize about the acts that I could've done and probably never will have the chance to do again.

We met through the internet. We met through Reddit. We had a connection from the start. I knew you were something special. We spoke everyday and every night. I told you my fears and hopes and dreams and you told me yours. I thought we'd be able to overcome the distance between us.

After nine months of constant talking I went to see you. You were sweet and gentle and kind.

 You were my first. I'll never forget it.

We were together for 4 days. They were the nicest four days I've had in a long time. We didn't do anything at all but I enjoyed being in your company and it seemed like you liked being in mine.

I adore your smile, you hair that's fun to play with and your silly little jokes you have.

I don't want anyone closer and I like you. A lot. And it recently occurred to me that you hadn't expressed how you felt about me. We don't talk much any more. A text every so often. Nothing more.

The silence is unbearably painful.

I know you are in a bad place right now

You have family and friends that are closer to you and are more capable of helping you.

I think that might be because you're the only one who holds it. You won't let it go; you won't trust

As soon as things seem too much, wasn't it? You didn't want me to chase for as long as I did. You were trying to run away, but your locked door stopped you from saying how you really felt - stopped you from telling me.

So, I'm not going to resume the chase; this time, I'm walking the other way. You'll still be running, but when you turn back to trip me once again, you'll find I'm no longer there.

Sure, I'm meant to be your friend. I don't think you really want me in your life, you don't need me. But you need to fix yourself, because no one else can do it for you if you won't let them in. When you decide to fix yourself then all the answers that you need, are lying behind the mask that you wear. Everything you're looking for is right there, you just need to find it within yourself.

1347426527.0,zr3ga,Dear M...,inlovewith_who,17,2,1,"I'll just get right to it: sometimes I think that we were meant to end up together.

Sometimes you're slightly obnoxious and a little opinionated. You have a bit of a temper and you're a little over-sensitive. You have a tendency to cling, and I never hold it against you. Sometimes your antics are *frustrating*, but there's never any malice in them, therefore I do not feel threatened. With you, I am able to walk away and cool down and come back feeling no resentment. Do you know how special that is for me? 

You're hilarious, trying to carve a good path for yourself. I like your family - they make me feel like I've come home, which is important to me because I struggle with feeling that way with my own family. I love that you're tall and slender. I love hugging you and burying my face in your chest while wrapping my arms around your waist. I like the colour of your hair, your freckles and your big, brown eyes. I like how you smell - your cologne, your detergent. I love how you flirt with me. 

You have a special smile that only comes out when you're being sweet to me, staring into one another's eyes nervously waiting for the other to lean in for a peck on the cheek. You would flash that special smile, nervously, and ultimately chicken out... but I didn't mind. Those summers were fantastic, you know. I treasure the time we spent as a couple.

I was talking to E tonight over some drinks on a patio in the city. We talked about love, but that there was always one romance that we waited around for - I wait around for you, you know. We ended our relationship so long ago, but I have never stopped loving you. I love you as a close friend, I love you in the same way one loves a brother, I love you as a lover. I love you for helping me to love myself when we're together.

You make me feel like 'my old self' again

Speaking of dark times, like I mentioned earlier, my interactions with you are so anxiety-free. Sure, we may find ourselves having a disagreement over one thing or another, but when I'm having a passionate conversation with you I'm actually able to get angry. Not, like, vicious... just angry. Frustrated. And it's beautiful, because I'm not good at being angry with anybody else but you. Whenever I'm faced with what I perceive to be an unpleasant situation my automatic response seems to be ""curl up into a ball and weep."" When I'm not crying

We're hanging out tomorrow, I'm going to fantasize about leaning in for a kiss. About what it would be like to position myself on your lap and run my fingers through your hair. About how close we are to your bedroom, and how much I'd like to be under the covers with you. I'm certain I could show you a *really* good time.

That's all I wanted to say

Love

I can't... I don't even know where to start. I wish I'd started keeping count of the nights I've either slept less than five hours or not even bothered trying to sleep since you died. For a month after, in the car with my mom, hanging out with friends. It was a month of seemingly spontaneously contracted narcolepsy. As if narcolepsy could be caught.

You lost a brother and a dad within a few years, definitely old enough to remember it, for it to hurt and to haunt. I didn't know your dad too well, but Eddie was my friend, too, almost an older brother. I know how that hurt, little one. You started doing heroin just like him

Okay, you told me everything. It didn't matter that you knew better, and that you were the one that held my hair back that time I threw up because I couldn't deal with something. It didn't matter that you were here when Hell told me she didn't want to talk to me anymore, again. I was always strong when you needed me to be, even though I started to go a little crazy the last month or so that you were still here.

And, yeah, but I didn't let it show, or at least you didn't say anything. You didn't die, and that was what was important. I was so scared.

The second time. Sleeping in a chair every night for two weeks so your mom could sleep at home. Not fun. Not comfortable. Having to walk that day it was snowing was also not fun

But that last night that I came up there. You asked me if I would cuddle with you

And then the next day your mom called me. It was raining, so fuck it, right? And then I bumped into her later, because I had to go get stitches because I'm stupid, small world, huh?

It's almost 5:30 now, and it's probably not the last. The last couple years haven't exactly been the best, but I can deal with that, I guess. Nothing's bothered me too bad so far. Except you.

Oh and then there's the best part of them all

The one time I needed all of you there for me and you were all gone. You believed her when she said I was lying about my surgery. 

Yeah

The look on your faces when I came back and you saw it was the truth was enough for me to figure it out. You looked at me in shock

Didn't say a single damn word to me. I sat down on my own slowly trying not to bend my leg because god forbid any of you offer to help me.

Only person that helped me was the one person I didn't think was a friend. They visited me when I was recovering and brought me books to read and stayed around for a few hours after school to keep my company.

Never saw any of you.

Then time went on after the whole surgery business and I would show up to the table and you'd all get silent. Look at me

Then I stopped showing up and started staying with them because they didn't judge me. Never told me I was stupid or that I was annoying. They never rolled their eyes at me about the social worker coming to see me every other day.

I don't know how or why the love for me left your heart

There is a part of me that wishes I had never dated you at all just to save myself from this hurt. However

It is my most sincere hope that you too felt loved and cared for by me. I hope that you never felt taken advantage of

You are the most important person in the entire world to me and I want you to have all the things in life that you desire. I've never wanted to hold you back

I wish you just needed time to think rather than suddenly be so over me and want me gone. I love you and always will. 

I don't know how to stop wanting you to be in my life. I want the joy of waking up with you and the comfort of kissing you goodnight and holding you as I fall asleep. I don't know how to turn that off or feel different. I wish I did.

The unfortunate truth at the root of this is that you just don't feel for me what you once did. I need to learn and accept

We

People keep telling me that now I can start making decisons for me now

I hurt that I can't be there to help you or just make sure you are okay. Its against every natural instinct I have to do nothing when I know you are in pain or unhappy.

Do you know how much joy I get from seeing you happy? It made me happier than anything else in this world. Your face lighting up, and joy that surrounds us. I'll never doubt whether or not that was special or that I loved it and you.

I still believe in the potential and possibility for us to have a loving relationship that makes us both very happy.

Nothing good in this life comes easy and when I think about the long hard path to a happy life there isn’t anyone else in this world I want at my side as I walk down it. I want you to be my lover, the mother of my children, and my partner and teammate to take on all the struggles &amp; victories, pain &amp; sorrow, joy &amp; happiness that come with life. I find strength in you to do the impossible, you bring out all the best parts in me and make me feel whole, you’re my rock, I hurt and pray that I can take away every ounce of pain you have. You are the smartest and most beautiful person I’ve ever met and I want to spend every possible moment of the rest of my life with you by my side. (that previous paragraph was part of my proposal that I had written)

That is a difficult thing to let go...

But, things I told you, my frustrations with him, were because it is painful to have a friend you believe to be so self destructive. Its painful to try and be such a good friend to someone for so long and not feel like that is ever appreciated or reciprocated. 

What caused us to grow apart? How did I not see it or know it until it was to late? If you truly loved me why didn't you recognize this and try to refocus on our relationship? You say that you did try to work at our relationship, but, when you spend so much time with someone, are emotionally invested in them, and sleeping with them... That is what it is, a relationship. You can call it what you like, but

When you say you are sorry are sorry for what you did or just sorry I found out? Are you sorry you hurt me or are you sorry that people are going to see the real you? Is this the real you?

Don't you owe it to me after all the years to at least try to work through things or communicate your worries and concerns to me so that we could have the opportunity to work on them? After all I've done for you (and you've done for me) and the life we were planning don't you think I deserve better than this?

You say you tried to work through things with me and talk to me about them. You said you tried to reconnect with me

Did you not feel comfortable talking to me about them or even acknowledging the things growing in your heart? Did you leave to pursue a potential relationship with him? Does he offer you something I lack or can not give? Do you crave instability or is your self confidence so demolished that you must have your self worth and value defined by what someone else tells you? That is heartbreakingly sad. You shouldn't need that

I know that he can offer a great deal of emotional support, so, he is able to devote every waking moment to you. Not to degrade that in any way, but, do you not believe I would offer suppport to you too? Did you think I didn't care? Do you not know that I would give you everything and more? You weren't getting emotional support from me because you were blocking me out and not opening up to me. I can't be there for you if you don't let me in.

Why won't you at least give it a chance? Life is long and we can slow down. It doesn't have to be an end. It could be a beautiful beginning of something new and better

I wish that this was just a break and we could try starting anew. I believe we could work on things while rekindling the love in our relationship and in our lives. It's still there

However

It is getting harder to think that you love me or ever did. You slept with my once friend not even 2 weeks after breaking up with me and forcing me to move out. We were together for nearly 5 years. That's fucking cruel. Did I hurt you in some way that has motivated you to act this way? What was it? What did I do?

It's hard not to feel sick I hurt so badly. I still don't understand why you don't want to try and work at things. Relationships are difficult, if you work at it, provides strength through trying episodes.

Did he poison your mind against me? He said, but, surely you must see that he doesn't truly have your best interest at heart. His acts are selfish and uncaring. You may look at what he has done as bravery and courage to speak as to what he says is in his heart, but, you will eventually grow to see that he is only motivated by his own most immediate wants and desires. He doesn't care who he hurts or the consequences of his actions as long as he can get what he wants. He isn't capable of looking long term and is only focused on his wants in the here and now. This isn't new, look at how he has lived his life the last 6-7 years. Do you honestly believe that he is unselfish and caring? Do you think that he truly has a good and decent character at his core? 

Maybe you prefer someone like that. Never thought you would

He has been willing to destroy nearly every friendship that he has just to get something he wants right now and may not want at all in the future. How do you not see that as a lack of character

He told me that he only saw three outcomes from all of this.

He gets you and I lose out on you and lose all my friends.

He doesn't get you

You both never speak of it again and he is in my wedding and I live life blissfully unaware.

How do you not see that as selfish? I know you talked to him about problems in our relationship... You didn't talk to me about those things. He saw that as an opportunity to intervene and get what he wanted from you. Which I believe was to sleep with you and then have our relationship. He got at least one. But

He can't have OUR relationship. It can't be the same because he isn't me. His love for you won't be as pure or unconditional. It won't be as true and steadfast. I may not have handled day-to-day things very well

If you didn't see that then you are the only person that knew us and didn't see it.

I wish that you would give us a chance. There isn't anything that we can't work through. You love me don't you? At least

I wish that you would have expressed your doubts and concerns to me or told me what needs weren't being met. I fear that you heard from someone you thought was a trusted friend that you couldn't tell these things to me. It's never good to keep these things bottled up. I firmly believe that deep down you know that you could have talked to me about whatever you were feeling.

I don't believe that many people

Not talking to you is the hardest thing in the world. Knowing I can't say a single thing or do anything makes me feel sick to my stomach. I get dizzy thinking about it too much.

I wake up sweaty with my heart racing a a desperate need to see you and make sure you are okay. I don't know what I've done to drive us apart. Maybe nothing. I feel completely betrayed by him and I don't know if I can ever forgive him. I can forgive you as I already have

He told me he has been planning this for a year or so and just waited for the right time. He waited until I was out of town and he knew you had doubts. Who plans or driving others apart? What kind of person does that? Check out ""The Magician"" by Somerset Maughm and see if you can see any similarities between him and the character of Oliver Haddo.

Do you love him? Do you love him more than you love me? Or loved me? Do you have any respect for me or even care about me and my feelings?

It's hard for me to imagine that you suddenly feel that strongly for him. He is a bad person. The way that he has acted and handled this situation should make that apparent. You don't do what he has done to anyone

God, what you thought. I never thought I could miss even the most trivial of details and moments. So many little things that I took for granted. Things that once felt routine suddenly seem like the greatest moments in the world.

I don't understand the complete finality of everything. I don't know why so suddenly you are so steadfast in your belief that there is no point in working at things and everything must be final. It seems so sudden and that makes everything so much harder to digest.

I can't eat or sleep and the idea that someone I thought of as my best friend (you) has so deeply betrayed me. I don't believe that you physically cheated on me, but, completely inappropriate on your part.

It hurts that you are spending this much time with him. I know what he told me and I know his intentions and his character. However

I fear that you are hurt and confused and I understand that. I am incredibly hurt and confused. Perhaps that isn't correct and this is what you want

I think of you as smarter and better than this. I don't understand why you are doing this to us or to me. You know that spending so much time with him is killing me. Do you want things to be worse for me? Is this vindictive? Is it cathartic or pleasurable to have this kind of power to hurt someone who loves you?

I don't know how to let go of you or stop feeling the same way I have for years. You haven't wanted to work at things but you want to work at them with him? Why? Can you not find a way to explain that to me?

It kills me that I have to give you space and stay out of your life and you spend all your time with a new love interest. You don't have to call it dating, spend all your time together, and are having sex... What would you call that?

Why won't you give us a chance? Why won't you be honest with me? Who are you becoming? Being with him, I know your heart and I know your potential. I want the best for you. If I'm not it, then, I can accept that and try to move forward. But, the best for you is not a person like him and I think you know that.

He is lying to his friends about what he is doing with his time in order to spend more time with you. Why would someone lie about something if there is nothing to hide? Shouldn't love be open and everyone important to you see it and know that it's there? Love and happiness cannot be born out of this kind of betrayal

I know you feel like he can give you emotional support but that's because he wants to right now. He will get bored with you, grow to resent you, become emotionally abusive and then dump you. That's what he has done with every adult relationship he has had. How do you not see that? Do you not remember how he spoke of his last girlfriend (and every girlfriend) and how he treated her? It was easy to not confront or acknowledge because nobody really liked her that much. But, the fact is that she cared very deeply for him and tried to do everything she could to make him happy. He responded by, at every turn and opportunity, telling her she was weak, not fun, and unwanted by everyone. That is complete emotional abuse.

Remember when you got upset and tackled me at the party and I made everyone leave? You were upset over something he said

He has never in his life been selfless. Remember how he treated me on my own birthday last year? On Tuesday after you dumped me he offered to take me out for a beer. We sat and talked for awhile and drank 4 beers each. When we asked for the check he requested 1 bill. When it came he said thanks for the beers

I am finding comfort in the fact that I am a fundamentally a better person than him. People know what he has done and will lose a great deal of respect for him. He yelled at me

Can you be with someone that your loved ones don't respect? People will be cordial to you at parties

I can't give up hope on us. I feel that deep down you want to give this a try. Perhaps I am wrong, beautiful, and loving relationship that will enhance both of our lives for as long as we both shall live.

I don't understand how you can't see what he is doing is so shitty. You're so smart

I want to write you a text or another email to just remind you how much I love you and how much you mean to me. I'm afraid that in doing so I will just push you further away from me. Do you know how painful that is? To be afraid to tell someone you love them? It's wildly painful

I'm not ready to give up on the idea that we can still work at things. It will be a long tough road but I know that it would be worth it because, we would have to take things slow, and we would get couple's counseling immediately. 

I don't know who you are right now. None of your behavior seems like you. It's hard to reconcile the way you are behaving now with the person I know and have loved for years. There are a lot of people that just think you're acting strange. You're so smart and driven, or character?

It hurts me to think you are hurting. Right now I feel like you are really hurting deep down regardless of how things are between us. I fear you hurt in a much deeper existential sense. I'm not as concerned about being with you as much as I am for you. I'm worried that you are hurting so badly that you are questioning everything. It isn't healthy to question EVERYTHING at once. You can't do that to yourself.

I wish I could reach out to you and tell you how much I love you, strong, and wise you are... I hurt thinking you don't know those things right now. You need to know them and never forget them.

If you are hurting

Everything has happened so suddenly. Amazing the things one can experience in a short amount of time. I've felt every emotion under the sun in the last month.

I love you L. I love you so much. I hope that you give me a chance and try to open your heart and let love back in. I firmly believe that if you open up to me and let my love for you back into your life we can use this as an opportunity to build and grow and ultimately come out stronger and better for having gone through something difficult. It's like the Avett Brothers say

You have to be open to it though. You have to want to work at things. I want to and will always hope that we can.

It doesn't hurt me that you slept with him as much as it does that you love him and not me. If it was just sex with some guy it wouldn't hurt in the same way. It would bother me, sensual, and sexy woman and there are tons of men that would jump at the opportunity to sleep with you. The fact that it was someone you have deeper feelings for and someone who I considered such a close friend hurts. It feels like you've replaced me. You say that you haven't, but, your actions show that you have. You haven't even attempted to just be alone.

It's very hard for me to think that you are really considering everything. After all the time we have had together and the life we were planning why don't you want to express any of your concerns with me? Why don't you want to even take the opportunity to talk to me and express how you feel? 

You tell me you want me around as a friend. You can't have your cake and eat it, how can you treat me this way?

I cared about making sure you were okay before thinking about how I felt. That is how much you mean to me. You are more important to me than I am. How fucked up is that?

Pretty fucked up I'd say.

People who care about me keep saying that I need to cut all ties with you completely. They keep telling me that I can't be involved with you

I don't feel that way.

Not yet.

Maybe not ever.

I guess I need to get there. To get to a point where I resent you

You say you are blown away by my maturity in how I have handled all of this. How immature do you think I am? How weak minded was your picture of me? Have you not seen every challenge I've faced? The person I've made myself to be? The things I have overcome and worked through? Look where my life was when we first started dating and look where it is now.

You say that I wasn't focused on the here and now, I shouldn't be made to feel bad for wanting things from my life with you and working to get them.

Christ, I can't speak to you. I hate that. I want to tell you so many things. I feel like when we do speak we make great strides and progress. We need to communicate.

But... It's too much. There is too much in my heart to communicate to you in any single conversation. There is too much I feel for you to fit into a nice little package with a bow. Life

To some degree we are all just floating around without purpose or direction. But, a common interest, a common desire.

We were fortunate enough to bump into each other and latch on and move life forward together.

Life is a scary and messy son of a bitch, you open up and communicate, you let love into your heart. Right? Am I crazy for thinking these things to be true?

I feel like I should express anger and pain and betrayal and frustration. I can't though. When I feel like I am talking to you or am speaking about you I can't say anything bad about you. I simply feel this urge to confess my undying love for you. 

There is a desperate desire to write something beautiful enough to make you feel what I feel for you. Or

I wish I had a better command of our language so that I could more succinctly express everything I feel. I know he will say what you want to hear and find ways to make you feel what you want to feel.

You aren't being honest with yourself and that is

Part of me wants to be back with you, right?

I love you so much, you are so lucky. Look at how the world has blessed you. You have a beautiful woman in your life who loves you, who wants to have children with you, that wants to build a life with you. How can one man be blessed with so much?""

I have grown to know that I am better than my circumstances, incommunicable, set of codes and principles. I have those...he does not. How could he?

L, I truly do try to be good to those that care about me. I don't know how you couldn't see that. I'm sorry that you heard me speak ill of people at times, but, sometimes I needed to let that out. It's difficult always being the nonjudgmental friend who constantly shows he cares.

I just want to feel like someone cares about me for who I am.

It amazes me that so many people tell me I am a good guy and deserve better

When you say your sorry are sorry for what you did or just sorry I found out? Are you sorry you hurt me or are you sorry that you've learned you have the capacity to be this hurtful?

It doesn't bother me that you slept with him necessarily... (You can do better though!) It bothers me that you are replacing me. Look at yourself

It's very painful to know that you have the capacity to hurt me deeply and be completely unaffected by that. That may not be entirely true

So many little things that I took for granted. Things that once felt routine suddenly seem like the greatest moments in the world and at the same time distant memories. I wish I could hear you laugh at one of my stupid jokes or have you practice another lesson on me. I miss laying on the couch with pup and listening to you play piano. You play so beautifully and I took so much joy in your ability to make such amazing music.

I miss the way you would pinch and slowly roll the skin on my knuckles while we held hands. I miss eating Ice-Pops with you in that old sweltering apartment. I miss dinosaur chicken nuggets and green bean dinners. I miss laughing at each other and at our pup. I miss baked bean kisses and golden monkey book ends. I miss listening to music and discussing its meaning. I miss singing the whole soundtrack to The Muppets with you!

I'm going to miss nights were we just flopped the two of us and watched a movie. I'm going to miss having a few drinks with you and belting out some of our favorite songs... I'll miss the way you let me sing even though I am terrible at it.

Most of all I miss sharing life with you, I miss seeing the world through your eyes.

At first I felt as though my whole world and life had been ripped away from me in addition to having my heart torn out. That wasn't a healthy way to work through this. I'm now trying to put this in a positive light. I've grown and matured with you and now I must use this as an opportunity to grow and mature independently. I have a great job and the bright future of a career in field that I enjoy. I want my life defined by how I treat others, and a desire to have people I've known better off for having known me.

I hope that you reflect back on our relationship and time together as positively as I am able to. We had incredible amounts of fun

Ultimately

Thank you for making me feel special. Thank you for showing me there is true love in this world, but, my family despite knowing all their faults and flaws. Thank you for making the time we had together as wonderful and special as it was. But most of all, dear L, thank you for being my friend.

I hurt, how I feel about you, or how I remember you and our years together.

The time we had was special and nothing either of us can do or say can change that. We were both very happy together for the vast majority of our relationship. That's special and I will always value and treasure that.

Goodbye L. I wish you the best of luck and a long healthy happy, and kind to others. Be as much of a positive impact on those whose lives you touch as possible. 

Take care of and show gratitude to those who love and value you, focus on bringing out the best that you see in them.

Surround yourself with good people and good friends. Put love and kindness out there (as you always do) and it will come back to you a million times over.

You laid every guilt trip in the book on my dad knowing he was the kind of person who wanted to help everyone. He improved your quality of life 10 fold and this is how you repay him. You sucked the life out of him for 10 years. 
I should not have put up with you as long as I did and I should have been more honest with my father. Maybe then he would have seen you for what you really are and gotten rid of you when he had the chance. 
Your shitty ungrateful kids stole from him
I will never forgive you for doing that to him. 
I will never forgive you for taking the greatest man I have ever met and drain him into nothing until he couldn't take it anymore. 
I want you to know that now that he is gone I am NOT putting up with your crazy bullshit anymore. you are NOT family. just because you changed your name does not make you family.  The M family HATES YOU. they all hate you and have never liked you. even after the funeral they still talked about how much they can't fucking stand you.
you will never be an M. you will always be a kofl.

You only had to wait for me for six months. You know I didn't want to leave you, but I knew you loved me too.

I guess this wouldn't have hurt so much had you not told me later that you loved me too. I immediately started to count down the days till I could see you again. I had given up hours upon hours of sleep just so that I could talk to you or see your face on skype. And it was stressful. God damn

How do you think I felt waking up to find out that you had began a relationship with another man? It's one thing to cheat on your significant other, **withheld**. Pause for a moment and try to imagine the roles being reversed. How would you feel had I not even told you that we were over and I immediately started to see someone else? Then imagine me telling you ""I only did it because I needed you to be here for me and you weren't so I found someone else who was."" 

You have no idea what you did to me. Being out here was stressful enough, and I just needed you to support me. I felt like I was letting everyone down. And you want to know the fucked up part about you and I? I felt like I let *you* down. For the last two months all I've thought about is you. I keep thinking about what I could have done different that might have changed the outcome of us. I keep thinking ""What did I do to cause this to happen?"". I keep thinking that I was never good enough for you. And you know what I realized the other day with the help of my section chief? It's not me.

I can honestly say from the bottom of my heart that I gave you a hundred percent of what I am. I am by no stretch of the imagination perfect, it was you that made the choice to kill us. It was you who couldn't wait a lousy six months to see me. It was you.

It's been about two months since it's happened. I haven't said a single word to you since finding out that you were seeing another man. I come home in a month, and a part of me holds all that rage inside for you, but it does no good. I can't force you to love me and I would never do so even if I could. I know I'm going to see you when I get back, and I have no idea what I'm going to say, and quite frankly I'm terrified of even thinking of it. Seeing you two together, if you still are at that point, will only crush me and cement me into a dark place that all this time has been creating for me. This time I have little doubt I'll be able to find my way back out.

You told me one of the first days after we started to talk that the one thing that bothers you most is when people call you heartless. I was one of the very few who had never ever told you that you were. And you know what? I still don't believe you are. As much as I'd like to say that you are to piss you off, but now...

I remember when you first told me about him.  His name was John, he's going to India next year as a missionary for fuck's sake.  As you described him, he sounded perfect.  I feel so blind, looking back.  I should have heard it in the long pause that followed your diatribe about what a fucking hero this guy was.  The worst part is that you didn't even realize you were doing it.  You were falling in love with this guy right in front of me, but both of us were too stupid to see it.  Your far-off look gave you away, but even when alarm bells should have rang, I trusted you.

The thing I hate most is that there's no one to blame.  I know you can't help your feelings, I still go back to your blog like a moth to a flame.  I see you writing poetry about him; you're much less cryptic than you think.  I see you going with your heart, but I hope he fucking crushes it.

You faked it so well.  Every moment up until you broke down and told me how you ""felt distant""

There were so many warning signs.  The way you'd treat your parents, but there was still that voice in the back of my head that said, ""She'll never do that to me"".

&gt;Hi
&gt;
&gt;Another semi-regular missive pointed in your direction. I'm not sure if you read these
&gt;
&gt;You know those moments in your life when you stay up late and go on Omegle and end up chatting with a teenage Brazilian girl who's got a firm grasp of the English language, and you recognize that this is exactly the pep talk you needed and thank god for 15-year-old Brasilians?
&gt;
&gt;Well I had one of those moments last night.
&gt;
&gt;Then today because Lorena The Brasilian challenged me to not be such a bump on a log, I could barely make it through them. I was sitting there in the library surrounded by artsy septuagenarians all the while having an emotional breakdown. After the last poem I went and collapsed in the bathroom and bawled. This wasn't because the poems were that sad…
&gt;
&gt;It was because I just don't go out to that part of the state any more. Because I don't want to see all these places you and me once were together.
&gt;
&gt;Because I don't want to face the fact that I'm still in love with you.
&gt;
&gt;But I think about you every day. Every single damn day. You come up and I just have to push you back down. It hurts too much to miss you. But as Lorena would advise me
&gt;
&gt;You know I've tried to move on, it feels disingenuous. And disloyal to my feelings. I just don't want to lead women on--I can't be that guy.
&gt;
&gt;I'm also convinced no one could make me feel the way you did. Meeting you was like gaining a new sense perception or seeing an entirely new color. You rocked me.
&gt;
&gt;My past letters were attempts to reach out in a friendly manner. Yes
&gt;
&gt;I think I was trying to be friendly because I was trying to forge a different relationship with you--one that would supersede my feelings. I think that was naive.
&gt;
&gt;So if you read this
&gt;
&gt;Lorena would be proud. Hell
&gt;
&gt;But even in my better place
&gt;
&gt;And God, even if I have a zillion guesses.
&gt;
&gt;So I don't know where you're at. I don't know if you live in Vermont or CT or if you died in some freak tea-brewing accident or what. A year and a half is a long time. I don't know if you have a boyfriend or a husband or a wife or all three. Or if you flat out just want me to go away and stop trying to contact you.
&gt;
&gt;If you're unavailable for some kind of reconnection with me I would consider it a really really huge huge favor if you wrote back and told me so. It would help me move on
&gt;

How I love you.  I'll never forget the moment I fell in love with you over 4 long years ago.  


I can't believe how much we learned from each other.  Both of us, that we were both so uniquely defined by the cultural norms that had been shoved down our throats.  We both began to question what we thought was right and wrong, things that had seemed so obvious no longer were.  This changed both of our lives, and we're both better people for it.  but in the end, we are not so different than how we started out.  I guess that's life.  But that is what has ended us.


Of course your family wants a nice Indian girl.  I tried for a long time.  I really did.  I learned to cook Indian food, everything about me changed ,and I didn't mean it to, and you never asked me to.  Now that you are gone, I'm left with India as my second home.  I understand it more than I understand my own country at times.  


I know you want to work it out, you know it.  Come on, we've both lived enough to know those happy endings only occur in cheesy Hindi films.  They will hate me.  Your younger sister won't be able to get married.  Your brother in law will take it out on your sister.  When your fathers health declines more, they will all blame it on you.  If they decide to keep you in their life, they will treat me like a slave, like shit, until I am broken down, and you love me


So one day, I wonder if you will ever tell her about me.  It will all be so predictable.  She'll be a doctor, or an engineer, fair skinned, shy and simple, from a good respectable family.  Your parents will be happy to get a new car for dowry.  There will be a big celebration and the relatives who would hate you now for being with me will all show up and shower you with gifts and sit in the cheesy plastic chairs and eat the free buffet at your marriage. All the petty bullshit drama will occur of what tradition to follow, and what custom dictates who pays for what.  Backbiting will be glossed over with feigned camaraderie  so no one looks bad.   But forget all that, I'm sure.  And this is the only thing that makes me happy.   I hope so badly that she makes you happy, the way you put your shirt on inside out and could go all day without realizing it.  I love you for those things.   I hope you feel open enough to tell her about your hopes and dreams, snuggled up next to your wife

See, before we got together I was 19 and never had a real relationship. Being the rationalist I am, I honestly believed that I didn't have the ability to be romantic. You know how guys seem to naturally how to be sweet and affectionate to their girls? Yeah, I was convinced that for some reason, that wasn't in me.

I was so very wrong. 

Sure it took a little while for me to let it out, oh wow did I ever! XD

I LOVE cuddling. It's just amazing. Seriously. Don't bother trying to seduce me (and fortunately you weren't the type to do that)

And kisses on the cheek. I prefer those infinitely more than kisses on the lip. Somehow they are just more enjoyable.

I tried to find my girlfriend to tell her ""hey I am shitting my brains out don't worry about where I am"" but I couldn't find her. After a clenched walk around the store I finally found her. I was now in a increasingly desperate dash to the bathroom which I found empty.


I immediately got a bad vibe from the toilet when I walked into the stall. The water was low and ominous and some toilet paper was floating around the bottom. Maybe I should have left right then but it was too late shit was going to blow. I plop down on the toilet and had wicked burning liquid shit. You know the kind. After throughly cleaning up I got ready to flush the toilet. But remembering the bad vibes I was nervous about the flush. I hit the lever and jump back.


What happens next could only be described as a three foot tall geyser of shit. Brown defiled water kept shooting up into the air and raining down on the floor. When that finally stopped the water level went up over the edge of the bowl spilling more diarrhea onto the floor. Paniced by the malfunctioning toilet I hurried out of the stall and washed my hands. As I was washing you walked into the bathroom and went into the stall. For a moment we made eye contact. The fear and disgust in your eyes was easy to see.

I will never shout from the rooftops about anything less than a political revolution. I feel no need to even raise my voice. I'm not random, or make it worth living in, or bring the greatest happiness in life. Just as much, the person who quietly moves forward with their life holds the world together. The greatest joys in life are just as much about keeping your mouth closed and your head down, doing what needs to be done, and appreciating the complete silence of an empty room. An even simpler joy is having read enough books that you always have something to think about and can rest easy because no one can take that away. You will never suffer from boredom for the rest of your life. 

You're crazy random. I'm serious composed, but I guess I have to. I'm at odds with you, and culture. I was ""cold"", while you dance. It's exactly like one of those shitty movies. These people are fucked up, in these movies. But through repeated efforts at having fun, a little patience on the part of girl-with-bangs, possibly drug use, unlike in movies

Those movies about the crazy girl and the geekish possibly depressed guy are the script for your life, licensed shrinks about my problems for a few years since I was relatively young, most of which helped none at all because as best anyone can tell I never went through a legitimate single traumatic experience with a definite end or beginning except for the entire prison system of public school, and I also had the pleasure of taking medication which was worse. In short, there's no quick treatment for public school, or to put it another way considering the time spent there, ""life"". Like me, you vastly underestimate the differences between yourself and people around you. If being a warm and sunshiney person helps you

It's ridiculous for me to even try to guess what love is, you and any other person you think is fucked up would probably end up the same. New years eve, sometime around high school graduation, I was essentially the same person I was years before when we met, and I would stay essentially the same person. I'm not the same person today, but that has almost nothing to do with you. You cried for the most standard of reasons, nobody understands me, tears streaming, I've been to. But I should've read the script to your favorite movie and I would've seen it coming. 

You could literally talk to someone for a few hours and discover something like their greatest character flaw. Not every time. It gets a lot easier with people you know for years, both physically attractive and they have intuitively re-invented the scientology love-bomb and use it against you in tenth grade. The point is, it's really easy to see that I like books more than people, being alone more than company, and have a beyond-reasonable desire for control over my own life. It's easy to see because I don't play well with others. Or I do, but I resent the fact that I have to put up with it. You, on the other hand, have a nicer strategy, or maybe you don't think like that. In any case

America is full of really unhappy people who can't figure their shit out. We're Americans. Everyone's going to hell and they're not working hard enough. All your problems are totally of your own making

I feel tired and like I've exhausted most everything that I wanted to say. All this appeared from the modern horror of Facebook, that's all you get when you go swimming in a giant pool made of other people's narcissism. By the way, welcome to my corner of the pool. Usually it's neat and clean but currently a bit of a swamp. If I was cut out to be a real writer I would get drunk and go through your pictures, wondering why you're so pretty in this one and so ugly in the next, lots of melancholy, wade through the feelings, etcetera, really, as best you can tell, thinking if this is really me feeling long term or short term

After you broke my heart, another friend of yours asked me out. I knew your feelings for me had disappeared back in middle school, so I said ""Why the hell not?"" and I went for it. But deep down inside, so desperately and miserably, I wish you'd asked me out.

Still, but because you deserve it more than anyone I know. I don't want to lose you as a friend ever, because that'd be insane. You're intelligent, you're goddamn handsome and you're one of the best guy friends I've ever had.

A year ago, I decided to make some tough decisions to stop settling. It wasn't easy. I gave up my dog, moved 6 times in less than 8 months, twice into complete strangers' homes and often had no idea where I'd be living the next week. Needless to say, I gave my parents some serious gray hairs. (Sorry about that!) I gave away most of my belongings. I quit stressing about the little things and became much more appreciative of family, friends and the simple fact that I had a roof over my head and a job to support myself. I proved I was much stronger than I ever imagined (Thanks sisu). It wasn't all a struggle though - I discovered I'm a hop head who loves motorcycles, can now drive a manual and for the first time, supportive, opened your home to me, distract myself with gratuitous amounts of Vampire Diaries and The Walking Dead or just gave me the space I needed to decompress

So, but it was worth the trip. From the Atlantic Ocean in my backyard to

After we broke up, and for a while I was bitter that you told them your side of the story so they thought I was the only bad person in this situation. I've realised now that I don't care anymore. I don't care about them, because what happened was between us and will stay that way.

Honestly, but the jokes you made about the career I love turned me off greatly. Towards the end, you turned me off too. 

I used to smile when I read your name, and it makes me laugh that you thought I would. You were always so full of yourself, you and your best friend. I hated how he treated his ex, I hated how both of you practically shunned me when I decided not to keep my mouth shut about it. You told me you didn't know me anymore when I mentioned Feminism, as if that's a monstrous thing; as if I was the monster. You've known me for years, you knew I wasn't bad because you claimed you loved me, so what I guess I'm angry about here is that you thought that was a turning point, I never knew what to say to you. I always was treading on thin ice to not upset you

I have a huge problem with depression and self harm, you had sex with other women and then you wanted me to beg for you to take me back, when I was already fragile enough. Do you realise what that does to a person? It was always a constant mind game, to make me feel like less and you feel like more. You loved it when your ex wanted you back and she argued with me about it, you loved the idea of having two women all over you. I remember that so well, because that was when your best friend didn't treat me like shit and he defended me, although I found out later that was because he was in love with me all along, he started ignoring me and making horrible remarks. Some best friend you have there

I keep talking about him because you really are both as bad as each other, I won't be scolded for drinking or going out or not being around to talk because I'm a student with work to do. I no longer get made to feel like I'm less that good enough for anyone, because even if that was unintentional, that's how I was made to feel. Towards the end though, I started to feel too good for you. Nobody is perfect though, I just wish I hadn't tried to fool myself into thinking you were at one point. 

So this is my proper goodbye, told me I should be ashamed for making you cry, told me that it was impossible for me to just stop loving you or be unhappy with you, although I wasn't aware he knew anything about our relationship. 

When he finally gave me the message you'd written me, I just looked at the words and I was almost intrigued. This was your goodbye to me? I wasn't aware you were the one who broke up with me and needed to say goodbye, I remember it being the other way around. You could have said goodbye the first time, but instead you wrote a long blog about how you still cry about me but you're getting better, how you'll always love me, all these things like I'll even care. Then you have to audacity to suggest that the reason I broke up with you was for someone else. It's taken me a month to even talk to another guy, and after what you put me through, I don't want another relationship anytime soon. But you know

You were the best teacher I had. You seemed to understand me, due to my previous record, like everybody else. I'm sorry I never told you that. You helped me get into the advanced programs, and suddenly I was getting straight A-s, and I was so proud to surprise everybody. But at the same time, I was drinking too much. Every day. It went fine for a while, I don't think anyone noticed.  It is, highly relevant to what happened further on

Do you remember when I showed up for school with a broken elbow, well, got into a fight. I decided to quit drinking after that. And that, I think, was about the time you started to worry about me. Because that's when the depression came along. I couldn't get out of bed, I couldn't go to school. But I had those exams coming up, and I knew I had to do well. Because you said I was the best student! I couldn't disappoint you. You were the only one who I hadn't disappointed yet. I want you to know that I didn't stop going to school because I was lazy. I never got to explain that. 

When the exam came around, street-grade amphetamines. I was awake for almost three weeks straight before the final. And I did alright, I think. But afterwards, I couldn't quit. I don't remember much, except that the few times I showed up for school, I would go to the bathroom hourly to take some more. Then came the next big exam. And I panicked even worse. Because now the Amphetamines didn't work like they did in the beginning. So I took too much. Way too much. 

But you know that. Because I literally wasn't able to speak during the presentation. And you pulled me over, and betrayed. You told me I couldn't do this anymore, that I was going to fail the year, and that you couldn't understand why I was doing what I did. I just walked out on you. Not because I didn't care, or didn't want to listen! But because I couldn't speak, and I was starting to cry. 

That's the last time I saw you. I didn't come back to school at all. I didn't even bother to drop out. I just... stayed away. I was so embarrassed and I felt so incredibly guilty. And I knew there was no coming back from that. 

So I want you to know: I didn't just brush off what you said. I'm not lying in a ditch dead from an overdose somewhere. I'm not a druggie, while working. Then, I want to go to a good university, and study. And I want to thank you for that. You made me believe, back then, that I could do something. You were the only one to speak up when I was at my worst, because everyone else was expecting me to end up that way anyways.

You cleaned up when Payton was born, a little.  You were still happy to smoke pot, which is fine.  God knows, I smoked it too.  And I truly believed that maybe our life would be okay.  Not great, but okay.

I think I finally broke when I could see the signs of your addiction coming back.  Your aggressive behavior

I cheated on you and even as I write this, and I feel bad for that part.  I shouldn't have done it, but I did.  I fucked two different men, carried on two different relationships at the same while i was married to you.  You knew about Jeff.  But not about Brian.

I apologize in advance if this seems a little scattered. I'm going off the cuff here.

I had a dream about you last night. It happens more often than I'd like to admit. You were dressed in sexy party clothes. You know how I always liked to see you, predictable as usual, but I still wasn't able to stifle how I reacted because I just loved you too much to do anything about how I reacted like a teenager to anything nice you did with me.

Then I woke up from this wonderful dream.

This could have been my reality to this day. This could have been what I experienced with you every single day. The kissing, the way we'd run around movie theaters to catch all the latest releases, the way I'd win you carnival prizes, the way we would spend time on the beach getting drunk and eating California burritos, the way we would cheer each other on about each other's futures, and our inside jokes.

It would have been easier if you weren't so terrible to me in the beginning. The obvious lies. The hooking up with other guys and lying about it to me was the worst. The way my friends insisted that you were playing me as a sucker. My denial. I hated that. We split up, I just couldn't get over the past. And I acted like an unbearable jackass, a total bummer, for it and paid the price again of things ending.

I really threw caution and rationality to the wind when we first met. When we kissed that first time... goddamn. It changed me forever. I don't think that there are many pivotal moments in my life that changed it the way it had when you kissed me. I still think about the way that your lips feel, was some of the best and influential I've had in my life. I miss you. I know we probably could never make it work at this point because of our respective histories, but I would love to catch up. See how you're doing. Let you know that I'm doing well. Hear that you're doing well, too, because I want that for you.

I don't talk about you to people because it would sound pathetic. You're supposed to be *over* people after this much time. But I'm not. I just hide it. I hate having to hide it like this. I cannot stand that we don't talk. I tried a couple times

To J: You toyed with my heart, though, was when I confessed my obvious feelings for you, and you didn’t feel the same. Luckily I got fired shortly after that, and you’ll live on in my heart as the guy I kind of, sort of, almost acted like a psycho over when I was sixteen.

To T1: You made me feel needed. And you really needed me. It was terrifying to me that someone I’d never met in person could feel so strongly about me, what I would say to you if you were in front of me. I would’ve said “Shhh.” I felt that ache in my chest for you, but I think it was sympathy. You were in love with me—how could you love me when I evaded you?—and I tried so hard to be in love with you. But I just wasn’t. We were different people. And I’m going to say the thing I’m not supposed to say: your foot fetish freaked me the fuck out. One picture of my pedicure and you demanded fodder regularly. You were demanding in general. I loved your ardor, but I wasn’t ready for it. I’m sorry for that.

To R: You loved the idea of me. We had barely interacted all semester—and I’d actually been pursuing another guy in our lecture—when you asked me on a date. A proper date. A movie. It was sweet. Despite my hesitations, but I couldn’t take it seriously because you didn’t know you were doing it—and because I knew I’d break your heart. Your hands on my shoulders felt odd and stiff, like mannequin hands. There was no spark. It wasn’t your fault, but I couldn’t force it for your sake. You were upset, as evidenced by your Facebook statuses. You’ll live, and you’ll love. For real. 

To A: You were an asshat, so that’s not so unusual. Your Facebook message was unusual. And exciting. I smoked pot for the first time with you, and got way too high. I drank too much, swore too much, got naked under a Snuggie too much during that week of partying last summer. I knew in my gut something was wrong, but I couldn’t fight your hands under the blanket on the couch. I was so drunk, and my best friend was so drunk and lying on the floor with your best friend. We all hated each other in high school, but you were cold when I dropped you off in the morning. A future? “Probably not” (I still can’t believe you actually said that) but it was fun. You made me feel sexy—well

To T2: You are so imperfect. You’ve been one of my best friends since freshman year and I’ve always harbored a little bit of a crush for you. Your girlfriend hated me. I never did anything, our ideas, our humor. She was so angry when you came to my 21st birthday. I was angry that you came, too, because you had your hand on a girl’s thigh the whole night (dude, she was nasty). Your girlfriend confronted me on campus with tears in her eyes, hoping she’d convince you not to leave her. You didn’t leave her then, fifteen feet from your classroom. She told me everything. Everything. You’re unstable. You’re depressed. You’re throwing your life away. These aren’t things she had to tell me

To Z: You broke my heart, and I didn’t really give you a second glance—until, around five in the morning, you took my hand. You kissed me on the porch and we both had cottonmouth from drinking and smoking. We shared a glass of water and innumerable kisses. It felt so right to be pressed against you on that dirty leather couch in the living room of some guy whose name I didn’t know. My friend let me stay with you, but he disapproved. I should’ve left with him instead of letting you dig deeper into my head and my heart. Over the next three weeks of Christmas break, I drove the hour to come visit you as often as possible. We kissed deeply, we kissed often. You called me your girl. To everyone you introduced me to, the next you don’t reply to my texts. You didn’t block me on Facebook or anything like that. I didn’t get angry or crazy, and I’m still coming down off the high. I can’t feel anything positive about you yet

But, but  in retrospect, I was unsympathetic, impatient, and generally bad to you. Even when I thought I was being good to you, I wasn't.

I have - I swear it, you don't try to fix it, you throw it out. Which is what we did. Good for us.

Still, all the what-ifs come rushing back to me, like *what if* we weren't both so petty, and *what if* our break-up was more civil? Could we actually be talking right now?

I'd say I want to be friends

Underneath all of this regret, never. Do you know how much weight that word holds? Infinite weight. Statistically, we don't have that much time left to live, only a few decades. Can you please send me an email before one of us dies?

I'm probably going to quit university. And whilst, the truth is that it wouldn't be this way if it *weren't* for you. You destroyed my confidence, my self-esteem, my self-worth. And what I'd usually do in this kind of situation is tell you, because you deserve to know that you're a fucking asshole. I know you think you're a good guy, so you need to know you're not, so that maybe you can change before you hurt someone else.

When we all first moved here, and moving to new places and meeting new people had never gone well for me in the past. But we got on well. I felt at home being with you, and our other new friends. I remember thinking that things were finally looking up for me, and that I'd made the right choice.

You kissed me on the bus. I was surprised

And I mean, and we talked about everything and anything. I don't know why I trusted you so much, but I did. I thought you were the nicest boy I'd ever met. You were goofy, sweet, and sensitive. The boys I knew back home were all assholes, but you seemed different. I missed you when I wasn't around you. 

But then that all changed. Two weeks later it becomes apparent you're dating another girl in our building, and used, but because we discussed before how we weren't exclusive I can't do anything about it but stay away from you. I try to talk to our friends about how I'm feeling, but it turns out that, whilst they know all about you and J, you never told them about us. I see the look they give me when I try and explain how hurt I am; they barely believe we were ever more than friends. I am absolutely humiliated. 

I was so angry at you, so rejected, so humiliated, and you noticed, and you got angry too, and we screamed at each other, but in the end we had no choice but to make friends again. Because I fucking needed friends. By this point, I had no one to talk to. My depression was through the roof. I was suicidal. I needed a friend

But it wasn't the same. You were with J wherever I looked and it made me sick. Every time I saw her, less damaged than me. I felt so sick. When I told you how it made me uncomfortable posing for photos between the two of you, you acted like I was crazy. No, I didn't still like you. My feelings took a blow to the head the second I realised I had been used in such a manner. But still, to see you every day, every goddamn day, and her too- when I had no friends, it was too much for me. I resented you both

Fuck you, but when the months pass and I slip into a depression so devastating that I'm planning my suicide and I can't leave my own room, where were you? Where was the compassion? I even texted you a couple times but you never replied. Once you IM'd me saying we should catch up, but after a few rounds of your one-word answers to my questions, you stopped replying then, too. You are a fucking asshole, and your actions have ruined me. I told you how sensitive I was, why would I forgive someone like that? Am I that weak? Am I that starved for human contact?

1348262937.0,109p1t,To my soon to be former employer:,KhemikalReaction,15,1,3,"I have been with the company for 2 years.  I have covered extra shifts.  I have missed funerals and family functions to make sure your business did not suffer.  I have driven here every work day over a 3 hour round trip commute (without counting traffic).  I have worked long and hard hours with nothing to show except written reprimands for acruing overtime.  I have uncovered software problems that were destroying your upper management bonuses.  I have uncovered pricing inconsistencies that were eating profits.  I have gone above my station to take care of customers

You have never done a thing to take care of me.  You have altered time sheets to fake unpaid lunch hours because I was not given the support to take a real lunch.  You have added duties to me without even the illusion of compensation.  You have worked me like a workhorse for 2 years because you could.  You made me quit school because you would not uphold the paperwork I signed saying that I would take this job with the stipulation that I have a consistent enough work schedule to attend classes.  You have chased off any and all of my coworkers that could have taken a little bit of the strain from me.  Every moment of every day you are looking for issues that won't make the business run more smoothly but will pad your pockets.  

I looked for a new job.  Everybody told me I should just be glad to have a job in this economy and to not jeopardize it by looking.  My days of have been spent going to other businesses with my resume and doing interviews.  My hours before sleep have been filled with job hunting online.  I found one.  I found one that is much closer to where I stay.  I found one that will pay me more (instead of the abysmal wage you give me.  How do you justify paying so much below the standard rate for my position and half of what my experience and contribution warrants?).  

They need me to give a 1 week notice instead of the 2 week.  I called and spoke with my supervisor.  She knows and has known that I am leaving and need to find a new position.  She is sad and I feel awful that I'm leaving her like this.  She understands and had going away presents and a lunch for me today.  All of my coworkers at this location are sad to see me go and they believe things are ""going to shit"" soon because of my leaving but they are happy that I have a better opportunity.  

My higher ups are NOT happy.  It is to these people that I write this letter.  You expressed that I'm leaving you ""high and dry""?  I'm leaving my coworkers high and dry...this is true.  I regret the strain I put on them.  I'm not leaving any of you in corporate ""high and dry"".  You will get your work...you'll just work somebody else harder to make up for it.  You have expressed no appreciation for what I've done to help you so these accomplishments should not be missed.  You believe that you have outdone yourself by giving me a .50 raise since you ""do not give raises"".  That 50 cent raise literally did nothing but make up for the lunch hours you've taken from me illegally.  It didn't even put a dent into the overtime you have shaved from my time sheets.  

I cannot express how sad I feel to leave some of my coworkers and friends for this new job.  I also cannot express how happy I feel to get out of this position and deal with different problems in a better paid position.

Your botched attempt to woo me I guess... But you kept pushing and pushing... I was whimpering, I didn't want to do it I didn't want this to happen.... but you twisted my mind, your breath scalded my flesh.... I remember it was cold and then you were so hot... burnt me to a crisp and threw me away like something dirty and spoiled.

I was pure once, you ripped me apart. I nearly killed myself... I could have died but you got most of what you wanted. I eventually found my voice. Said no. But it was too late. The screams I should have yelled five years ago are still boiling in my stomach like acid. Still waiting to force themselves up, scalding my throat, still wanted to blast apart my lips and burn you to the ground. I'm a volcano and I can only erupt with the word no and still I'm too scared.

I let this happen. How could I let you do that to me? I was sixteen. I knew that maybe if I screamed then you would stop. You forced your ravenous soul inside me and told me I liked it, mouth searching, licking, teeth brushing against my nipples.

Was it worth it. Steal a girl's innocence and throw her away like a dirty rag. I'm dirty from your hands

She knew though, my eyes no longer clear, they were hidden by the grime and crap you spread on my soul.

Clipped my wings, slit my wrists, how could I let you do this to me? It's my fault right. I never said the word no and that....that is your saving grace isn't it? Because I did not push you away because I was too weak, too young, too scared.... too dead on the inside to do what could have saved me. I've spared you lifetimes of pain because I never shared it all.

I've saved you because what am I supposed to do, hey, when I was sixteen this guy took advantage of me can you please arrest him. I have no case and that is your saving grace.

It's been four years since you killed yourself. It's hard to believe it's been so long, That the police thought I'd killed you at first because I had your blood all over me as well. It only seemed fitting in the end that I had your blood on my hands, at first. For years, I've thought I'd missed something. For years, I've only been able to see your blood when I looked at my hands. But, I've finally come to terms with it. I don't think I'll ever really 'get over it', But I've learned to atleast live with it just tucked away in the back of my mind. 

Sometimes, of that day. I know you left that letter for me, But I've never gotten threw it all. Everytime I try, I get to where you ask me to forgive you, and I lose it. You never did anything wrong, you were never anything but perfect to me. If I anything I should be thanking you. If you hadn't confessed to me on that Christmas day, I'd have never known that you felt that way. I mean we were so close ever since we were little

I've been in a couple relationships since you left, because it's not fair to them. I just wish you were still here so I wouldn't have to even worry about it. I just wish we could be together again. Ya know, I really do miss you like crazy sometimes.

I hate you. I hate what you did to me. What you made me become. B, tell me you loved me. And then, one day, you started to say these strange things. I smiled too much. I was too fat. Too ugly. So, I started to smile a little less, laugh less, and eat less. When I ate, and you didn’t care how I got that way.  But then you started calling me these names. Bitch. Whore. Cunt. Stupid motherfucking slut. I still hear echoes of this today. You called me these awful names, slapped me, and I almost fell down the stairs. While I was tottering on the edge

One day

Over a year later, and I was going to fall in love and grow into a strong woman. You kissed me one day, right after you broke up with your girlfriend. You said you needed time to get over her and I gave you time. A few days later, you kissed me again – we had been cuddling on my bed. The rest is my fault... I know it. You kissed me aggressively and asked what I was thinking. I said it was nothing. You smacked your head against mine. Hard. I said not to do that. So you started kissing me again. I didn’t want it. I asked you to stop. You pushed me so I was lying down all the way on the bed. I asked you to stop. You got on top of me, spread my legs. I told you to stop. You put your hand in my crotch and started rubbing. My roommate started coming in the door. You jumped off me and left. I didn’t tell her. I just let you go. A few days later, we were talking and you called me a bitch. Twice. Knowing what I had been through before. I started to relapse immediately. B’s voice grew louder in my head. I had to fight to keep food down. I started harming myself, just a little. I got myself back in check in a couple months. I felt stupid

How could you bastards do this to me? I hate you.  I hate you. I hate you. Fuck you. Fuck you. Fuck you. I   fucking hate you. I hate you more than I hate war. I hate you more than I hate being alive. I hate you more than I love everyone else. And that’s an awful lot

I have been sexually assaulted, that I confessed to. He walked himself inside my apartment, while my best friend/roommate, *Beth, and our mutual friend, *Dan, were there, and I didn’t even know. They left me way back at the bar. I was really fucked up because I drank too much. I don’t even know when exactly and for how long he followed me. My friends that left me didn't even care where I was. They went to bed and had no clue what happened to me; never tried finding or calling me. They even stopped to get food before coming back. The guy bashed my head into the bathroom sink. After I realized he was raping me

I’m sorry for telling you about this. Although I am over my ex, put me on the shelf when he didn’t want me and took me down when he did. He was the only person I ever fell in love with. I broke down and confessed this delicate, fragile feeling to him, only to be told flat out that he never felt that way about me. I’m afraid of that again. No one has ever been in love with me before. Or at least no one has ever told me so. I want to feel that way for you but I am scared. I don’t want to become more broken. And I hope you never find this letter.

1326347596.0,odkkx,To the girl that changed me:,bobzmccormick,15,0,2,"Hey. 

I really don't know what it is I want to say

Before I met you I was pretty sure where I was headed. I was self-loathing and terribly insecure; I didn't think I could impress anyone, and decided to make a hypocrite out of me, because God. Just a few fucking weeks talking to you and I was already hooked. You're a goddamn drug.

Of course, even if you didn't put yourself into your school work. You were witty, you were funny. You got my humour. You understood my penchant for using British English and it was those little things that drew me to you. How lucky I was that you randomly decided that you didn't know enough of your facebook friends and doggone it you were going to talk to me even if you didn't know who I was. (I realize that last sentence made this whole thing seem way less...impressive, I suppose. I don't give two shits.)

You apparently didn't think so about yourself, and I just didn't understand. I had no idea how else to tell you that no, really, you're absolutely perfect. Everything about you. 

You're damn distracting. Even before I told you that I liked you, but I sometimes daydreamed that we lived together some time in the future; that was probably just cause I never got to see you much when we live with our parents. Fuck, now I'm thinking about it again. 

When you told me you were diabetic I was devastated. And now I'm sitting here caring about a disease that doesn't have anything to do with me; I'm not Type 1. I have no reason to care about Type 1 now

I know it probably isn't healthy to think about you this much, feel guilty when you said I made you cry, and then show you that immaturity was both natural and expected in these sorts of situations cause you've got to start off somewhere. But even though I convinced you that 'love' was not ready, you kept suggesting it. Just hints. And I finally gave in. Because you really made me love you. Because you made me go against everything I've warned myself against for years. You made me open up to someone and offer my whole heart even though I'd been raised to trust and love no body; I guess you didn't understand that part.

Because you fucking decided a few months later to tell me that you don't know if you ever fucking loved me. You said maybe you weren't ready. You didn't know what  you were doing. You don't think the relationship is worth it anymore because  your fucking mom is getting suspicious about you being gay. What the fuck do you think I was dealing with for the past few months? You'd get mad at me when I would say anything that implied that I cared more. Guess what? It was fucking true. I shouldn't have given you all that trust, you don't want to talk to me because you're being irritable, it's not because of me, but not talking to me will make you less irritable, you aren't ready for a relationship and you don't want to lead me on, but by the way, you still have feelings for me. What the FUCK am I supposed to think? Do you honestly believe that saying all of this shit is helping me? It fucking isn't. It HURTS. SO. MUCH. Because I DON'T want to admit it

To be honest

I know you were frustrated. You didn't like that it didn't feel real, we skyped for AGES during the summer. But that's just not the same. And now that the school year's started, you can't get online late anymore (that's my fault for keeping you up.) You don't have a phone anymore because you're too stubborn to take the F in Chemistry and decided to cheat with your recently-granted texting (even though your mom was already unhappy with how often you texted me late into the night.) You can't go out because you don't have a phone. I'd like to say it's not your fault that we stopped being able to see each other, but it's your fault that we stopped being able to see each other. I am holding that grudge.

I hate you because I just can't stop loving you. I hate that you haunt all my dreams. I hate that every time I close my eyes I imagine you in front of me, happy - I imagine you telling me that you're willing to do this. You'll tell your mom that you're bisexual and date me. You'd switch to my school - anything, really. I get so happy. And I wake up and realize no, you didn't say any of that. In fact, you barely speak to me. When you do, of course, you lead me on like a fucking psycho, your interests

I don't believe in love. I don't believe in people. I trusted you more than anyone I have ever met. I was convinced we had something real. But. I was wrong. I had to have been, but it still doesn't feel like it was wrong. I was never unhappy with you. I was never angry at you. Even now, I'm not mad. I just hurt. And I ache. And it's been 7 months. 

I can't make this stop. I just want it to fucking stop. I haven't let myself really cry in a while, it feels like you're not acting like you. Even if I'm obviously wrong about who you were. If that makes sense.

And you constantly resisted my attempts to sit down and compromise on a new arrangement.  

You told me you were planning a party for an exchange student you befriended.  I said it sounded like fun and asked for the time so my boyfriend and I could stop by, because we'd be bad influences.  We drink too much apparently, if you are of the opinion that 2-3 drinks a week is excessive.  

The breaking point was when I told you about my change of majors.  You knew I'd been struggling with depression on and off for years, and was dreading another two years of the same.  Your response?  ""Wow, I wonder how your mom deals with having two lazy-ass kids.""  Fuck you.  Fuck you for dismissing my goals and preferences, and fuck you times infinity for bringing my brother into this (who you also haven't met).  

You're a terrible person.  You're incredibly irresponsible.  Your tuition bill the last two semesters has been paid by your boyfriend and the guy you friendzoned and still pathetically string along for the ego boost (but it's not *your* fault, I don't think you've actually passed a test so far in your academic career).  The boyfriend you're probably cheating on (I can't think of any other reason you would make plans to room with ""J"" next year, especially after your boyfriend accused you of sleeping with ""J.""  Also can't think of another reason ""J"" would say your boyfriend is no good and give you an ultimatum to break up with him, which you actually gave serious thought).

We met a year ago at a friend’s party

We talked through Xbox live
I told the friend who hosted the party about my crush. He said I should confess but I didn’t.

Half a year later I did
We went on a date the week after that. We were planning to go out for dinner and catch a movie. We hadn’t seen each other in half a year so it was very exciting. 

Our date kind of.. failed..
We were originally going to see the movie at town A
Since town B was further away for me

After arriving It occurred to me that town B was a lame ghost town. The only thing to eat was pizza

So while we waited for the movie, not knowing what else to talk about. He walking behind me, answering my questions and not being very excited.
We headed to the movie theater where we had to wait an additional 15 minutes. They seemed to last forever.. Not in an enjoyable way.

We were hungry
When we could pay our tickets (which I ordered) he took out his wallet to pay, looking defeated. My heart crushed at that point.
Well

I looked like a fool by the way. Wearing my glasses

We sat there

So after the movie
We chatted a bit and the mood actually seemed a bit more relaxed than before. 

I misunderstood him when he told me that he missed his train. I thought he missed the last train so I asked him to go back to my place so my parents could give him a ride.

He also misunderstood something.. (At this point I was really clueless
Well, just a quick glance.

After I sat down in the bus I saw him walking to the station
I texted him, and that he had fun. Nothing more, we didn’t speak much after that.
A few days with little to no talking later
He said he liked me, he just didn’t like me, simple as that.

So after that we have me

So yea, doesn’t like me while he says he does, and will probably never speak to me again.

I considered him a friend, but he always has something else to do.

If I ask him if I’m bothering him with my invitations
I still think about him a lot

But I still want to

I’m not hot, or super interesting. And I’ve never even kissed let alone held a boys hand except for my fathers. And I’m already 19! I’m actually a really boring person, who doesn’t do anything special, or have interesting goals, or fun friends.

I won't ever forget your beautiful, or the care and empathy you (used to) show when you saw someone hurting. I wont ever forget how I was able to let loose and be myself around you, however unintelligible and crazy as I could be. Our sense of humor was weird and when they'd get us in the same room together, it was just plain ridiculous. From the time we first met, it was as though we had known eachother for years. We'd finish eachother's thoughts, like we were (frighteningly) connected at the brain. 

When you found out it was you I was interested in, regardless. I was cool with that. I respected you enough to be ok with things being the way they were; broken hearted, but grateful to still have you as my best friend.

But then that asshat took you away. He made you into someone that I didn't recognize anymore, when I know that's not the real you. You started playing mind games, being rude, blunt and hateful, just like him. Again, that's not the you I knew. 

I finally gave up trying to get you to understand that you're worth a million, from happy sparkling eyes to sadness and stressed. I hate that fucker for the way he treats you. And I hate you for the way you treated me.

I tried to put you out of my mind, but I do miss you.

I will always love you. You are simply, silly, beautiful person. Please don't ever, ever, ever, forget that. You deserve so much more in this world than to be treated the way he treats you.

I'm married with a kid who's 2 year olds. I love my kiddo to pieces.

Everything else....? I'm 50-50.

Husband, surf the web, look at porn, whatever.

You work an 8 hour job. I get it. It's rough. But guess what? Other men work, and they help them out caring for the kids! And they have more than 1!

I can't go shopping without a phone call asking when I'll be home or come home to baby son up WAY past his nap time. Change a diaper? OUT OF THE QUESTION. NO. NOT MY JOB. 
Oh
That doesn't really count....

It doesn't help that most of the interaction you with your son is yelling at him. Then you wonders why he runs away from you? Surprise

Boy

I can't even take a bath alone without baby son coming in and wanting to join

The concept of “daddy” doesn't come from providing money and provisions; hell, not you! Not that that's bad, but, as I said, money and provisions don't make a father. Is baby boy going to look at the food and his room and say “Wow! Daddy is so great and loves me so much because look at how he provides for me!”
Lemme just say NO.
A dad is a man who loves, teaches, shows the attributes in himself that he wants to instill in his child: patience, gentleness, kindness, self-control..... 
You are what you're becoming.

I don't do everything right, and support no matter what happens and what decisions are made. 
However, that responsibility for your own actions turns to blame which is shifted onto me.

“WELL MAYBE IF YOU KEPT THE HOUSE CLEAN....!!!”

What? Then you'd start wanting to help me out? Then you'd start being a better father? Then you wouldn't be so angry all the time?

When you becomes the one who's wrong
There's always a reason

“It's my childhood!” “I was always blamed!” “I was the black sheep!” “It's EVERYONE else who makes me feel angry!” “I'm unstable!”

Find your excuse. Stick to it. If need be

At this point
Do something.
But stop treating me
Like I'm unworthy, the REAL problem, the bother.
I've been treated like that ALL my life.
I know I'm not special

You

I'm starting to not care that the things I do “annoy” you.
Typing, urging you to take responsibility for your things and your actions, my humble jobs that I know you don't approve of.

I GET IT. I SUCK.

But if you hate it so much
But if you love me

Compromise, care, think, accept hard things.

I also feel pressured like I'm constantly in a tight spot to keep up with my own life
BUT.
The thing I can't change is YOU.
And you, when life is a big enough mountain for me.
I didn't want you to become that. I wanted you to be the one I walk hand in hand with while we faced that stupid life-mountain together, avalanches, and all! 

If you're unhappy

Okay?

This is not a slam or a call-out.
This is a firm reminder.
A reminder that I love you
A reminder that, but it's life. Okay? Everyone has shit they gotta do keep living. Doesn't mean you can't enjoy it or you can shirk because you think “you've done enough for the day”.

Being a father and a husband isn't something that just stops because you're grumpy and tired and you've worked hard all day.

Okay?

Look.
Just think about your actions and your words. The affect us, whether you mean it or not, your words in any mood can pack a wallop.

Think about what you want to do.
Okay?

I love you.

Stop making me doubt that I do.

I would like to start off with the fact that I love you and I am glad you made some changes and try to be in my life. I try to be understanding. I really do. I know that alcoholism is a serious disease and a very hard thing to go through... but you had kids

That said

And I know that Mom cheated on you. I understand that you were angry. But you can't fucking stab people on the front lawn! And you can't try to kill yourself in our bathroom

And I get that you were in jail

Except I never really felt like you came back into my life. Not really. Slowly

You didn't come to my middle school or high school graduation

I was in the spelling bee, acting, choir, soccer, basketball, and volleyball. My team won the battle of the books 3 years in a row and I was the highest reader out of my whole school for 2 years. You didn't show up for anything. You never acknowledged me. I got a scholarship for high school. I had a 4.0 from 4th-12th grade. Why was that not good enough? Why didn't you love me?

Mom always told me that you did

Then I got into college. One of the best colleges in the state... and you still weren't proud of me. You still wouldn't contact me. I HATED you. Sometimes I worry that I still do.

I feel like our relationship - as a friendship, short response that’s not reassuring at all.  And maybe all I need is someone to listen - but I don’t even feel like you’ll do that for me.  

Maybe this is all my fault.  As I’ve said before when I’ve been hurt by friends, so I have a few really close, deep friendships.  I thought that was what the other person wanted too, but maybe I was wrong.  Maybe I’m better off keeping everything inside, not trying to form deep friendships, and have lots of shallow friends and smile and go throughout my life like everything is perfectly fine.

You moved up to help your brother paint his house or something, I didn't care. You were absent long before you left, you were full of negativity and probably depression but instead of doing anything you decided to let it out on us verbally. Making us feel like shit every time we came home from school.

Yet I still felt sorrow at the fact I didn't feel sorrow, excited to get out of here. Gave me a weird side hug and said goodbye as I refused to move from my attention from the computer but as soon as you walked out my door, I regretted it, I followed you to your car saying bye and drive safe but never ""I love you"".

Anyway, what was only 4 weeks ago, the phone rang and echoed in my house as I was home alone. I had to answer it, not knowing who was there on the other end, it was you.

""Hellooo.""
""Hi *my name*
""Oh hey

I used the word there because I didn't know where you were

""I'm watching the sun go down...""

What could have been seen as foreshadowing of the impending news was in fact a hand that you extended to me, whatever reason you obviously wanted things to be better between us. My heart  was confused and undecided as those 6 words broke through the perpetuating layers of resentment I created to protect myself from you, from you leaving us. I stumbled, trying to prevent an awkward pause:

""I..uh got a minifridge in my room""

You responded with hearty laughter

We talked not for long, when I start my exams, before it came to a conclusion though you told me how you stopped smoking and had not been facing any withdrawal symptoms. I could not feel happier for you.
""Yeah

You continued:

""Apparently I probably will have Emphysema""

I didn't feel so happy anymore. It was a moment of clarity, I wanted you to say that you loved me. I know you do, I'm not stupid and I know our relationship isn't as straight forward as that. You find showing affection to be awkward and out of your person but what if it was the last time I heard from you. You should have. You don't know how fucked up your body is from decades of aggressive smoking. You really should have.

---------------------------

Coincidentally an hour later, yet he found the words to say ""I love you *My Name*"". He is literally imprisoned, whilst you were merely imprisoned by your misplaced sense of stoicism. 

Before I started writing this, happy, you made me feel safe, don't get me wrong you'd keep us in line but you showed you did it because you cared, somewhere along the line. Maybe after the injury, you lost all that. As we grew older, we grew apart and you chose to abandon us altogether.

You never wanted a child with special needs

The earliest memory I have is laying on a brown couch thinking I was going to die. Where did this memory come from? Why do I remember it so well? Grandma told me that the memory was true her sister was in town she wanted to see me when they came to pick me up after calling they found you and dad in the back room getting high with my two sisters in the room with you. They found me on the couch barely breathing and rushed me to the hospital. Is this true?

Why did I have to have open heart surgery at the age of 3? You told me I fell down got a virus in my blood stream. Grandma told me that because you where too busy getting high to take me to the doctors when I got sick, because you I got to go to heart camp.

Why when I was in the first grade through high school you would never wake me up, never help me with homework, never made sure I made it to the bus on time. Why did I have to do that on my own, why did I have to wake you up so you can wake up my sisters, get my sister backpack ready, get their school clothes ready, make them breakfast and take them to school? Pick them up from school make them a snack, why by the time I got home, I have a job, dad is now homeless.  

Why did it take you two weeks after I told you my ankle hurt to take me to the ER? Why did you cancel my bus when I fractured my ankle, if I missed dinner it is my fault. You have a special need child mom I didn't understand this, I didn't know what to do.

Why when I made my first friend did you tell me I shouldn't make friends with someone who is retard. She was not retard

Why did you tell me that bullies would always bully me that even if you did something they would never stop
I guess this helped me more then hurt me

Why did you tell my teacher in front whole class that I wanted to kill myself my freshmen year. God I hated you for doing this. Thankfully I made friends with ""normally"" people yet you helped me make friends with the special ed students who felt the same way I did. 

Why did you always always take my sisters to school and pick them up from school yet you made me walk 2 miles to school and back home while you pass me when you took all of my sisters friends home. You made me feel hated, but I will make sure I never do this to any of my children.

Why did you pick drugs over me? Why did you have to die? Why do I love you and hate you? It has been almost 10 years since you died, I still miss you like hell, I wish you were here. I wish you could see me who I am today. I cannot wait to have children when I do I will make sure they feel nothing but love from me, I will never single them out, I will never let them feel the ways you made me feel.

it’s pretty disgusting

have you _ever_ had a relationship where you didn’t cheat?

because i am so far beyond letting anything you do affect me

it does make me like you even less

just the fact that you keep doing the same thing over and over again

i mean

you do what you want

i really can’t sympathize with complaining about your ""friends"" revealing something you wanted to be secret

well

because it means you have shitty friends

maybe you should have considered the fact that they were a shitty person before

you never were a very good judge of character

I am writing to you from work because you are all that I can think about but I honestly don’t know where to start. The last month has been a complete whirlwind for me. After my break up and your divorce, I never imagined we would be here. I never thought you and your wife would get divorced. I never thought my relationship would end either. But we are both good people and we both deserve to be happy. And you make me happy. VERY happy. You told me that you were falling in love with me and I agreed that it was a mutual feeling. We’ve been talking every day, multiple times a day for the last month. Considering the circumstances of your living situation and mine, we obviously need to take things slowly as to not cause confrontation with our previous partners. Cool, I get that. But when we are all out at the bar and you leave with her because she is your ride, I feel like my chest is going to implode. I know you sleep in separate rooms. I know she already has someone else. I know nothing would ever happen. And I want to believe you when you tell me you don’t want her around. That I am the first thing on your mind when you wake and the last before you fall asleep. I want to believe you so badly, but it is so hard for me to watch you both come and go places together. I am not in any position to tell you that I don’t like it. I am not in the position to be upset. So instead, I will remain silent and strong. Things will take a while and I am prepared for that. You are worth the wait.

We need to stick to a planned and written schedule and changes to it need to be communicated between us in writing and the kids need to be told verbally what's going on. 

I am not going to continue our text message conversation

You sent me a text today at 4:34 (10 minutes from when you are supposed to pick them up):

""Hello

I go back looking or any record of such a statement and of course there is none because you never said anything about such a thing.

I reply at 5:36

""Thats not a reminder ..a reminder means you told me before""

at 5:48 you reply

""Well

See, our son had DI after school on Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday.  You picked him up from school on Tuesday at 5:30 and came to get our daughter from my house.   I remember the conversation with her that we were spending less time together because of the music lesson day change.  Your incorrect here, you do not remember what happened last Tuesday.  Today you simply flaked and did a no show is what happened. 

When I took the kids home at 8

""the kids are home alone""

To which you had a catty reply:

""yep just like they were home alone yesterday all day"".

That was the end of the text conversation for me.  It looks like you want to argue over text and I am not interested in that. 

I do not really understand how you can honestly compare the two things.  I had to work on Monday

You compare the kids being home then because I was working, in order to support them and you and cannot possibly reschedule the meeting because it is a global priority 1 issue.  You compare that to you flaking on the schedule and going to the gym...  and somehow end up mad at me as being an asshole. 

In the past during our marriage I would have fallen for this.  I love that about you, I would have felt like a jerk for upsetting you.  I would have beat myself up mercilessly while drinking myself through the depression i was facing during that time.  And you would have the smug satisfaction of having me to blame for it. 

Then imagine my surprise when my son calls me at 9:15pm, tell him it's ok and that I love him.  He calms down and is laughing after a few minutes feeling better.  He hands the phone to you and I can immediately hear the poison in your words.  You came home and had no one to give your guilt to so you gave it to the children.  When our seven year old started crying you had him call me.

In the short time that I've known you, and - in a roundabout way - made me see the good in myself. You've made me feel more of ""a man"" than I have ever felt, yet brought me down to Earth in a way I didn't expect.

I wish we met each other earlier.

It isn't that unlikely. I could have sought work here instead of school, we would've met much sooner, and likely have been together at a more opportune point. 

I, and I am reminded of constantly. The greedy side of my heart wanted to tell you about it so I could get the physical and emotional comfort I had sought for so long, but the sensible, mature side said that now isn't the time. I'll tell you when I'm ready.

Had I met you earlier, would have given me the confidence and courage to avoid the circumstances leading up to what happened. I could've said ""no"" much more forcefully, and escaped something that helped twist me.

You, but not because of them; rather, it was in _spite_ of them.

You stop me from doing such a basic human function that most people don’t even think about it when they’re doing it. You gave me a fear of choking, and of others choking. To such an extent that it would stop me from eating. You made me think I was a brat, and frustrated them to no end. But in reality, so what? Someone will help me.


You fill me with “What if?”s, hearing noises in the night which most would know were nothing. But you perceived them as life threatening, you’d make my heart pound, choke me, make my whole body shake violently with fear. By the time I was in grade 11 and 12, I would only ever sleep once a week at home. My brain had to make up for it by having naps in class, every class, I just want to be normal.




**I think the next of you to mention is OCD.** You’re barely around, we find they’re all locked. Then you forget I just did it and make me do it again until the sun comes up. But we haven’t done that in a while, and I’m proud of that. Good job.



When GAD is being annoying during the day, and we see our room is a mess, it stresses you out so much. You give me a burst of energy and I do nothing but clean and straighten until it’s perfection. But then again, this doesn't happen that often these days. And I know you only do that stuff in your own weird way of wanting to relieve the stress, I get that. 



You do think about weird things though, making me feel curious as to what it feels like, we won’t be doing that though. A lot of harmful thoughts like that. Though some aren’t as harmful and just a little weird. You are extremely curious, and make me want to smell and taste everything. I don’t let you taste anything that could be fatal though. We’re actually doing pretty well. But a little of the credit for that goes to Ms Depression over there, who makes me not care about that stuff.


**Depression, my first year of highschool. You kind of just sat in the corner for a while not saying much, but you were still there. Sometimes I didn’t really feel anything, or just felt sad for no reason, but I brushed it off. I figured most teenagers have this kind of thing. Didn’t really have any friends which may have been why you showed up then. But you started to head for the exit when I met someone in the last half of the year. A friend of my brother. We all liked him a lot, he was my best friend, and eventually became more. Though the next year he had to move to a new school. Luckily we both didn’t have much of an interest of being in school, I had to break up with him. It wasn’t my choice, giving no reason. Just breaking off contact. I regret that. I considered myself ‘his’ for years after that.



Depression decided to creep slowly back in, driving my brain and my body. It hid my happiness from me all the time, I could rarely ever find it. Around this time I stopped believing in god. I still sometimes wish I believed, and I think so much about that sort of stuff, but I just can’t convince myself. I suppose it’s GAD that wants to believe it, because it’s so afraid of dying and not existing anymore. It got so down that it would hurt me, whenever I got the opportunity. I would hide in the bathroom at work, and cut the heck out of my body. Sometimes depression didn’t do it. Sometimes it was me



When I was 18, from sleeping. You wouldn’t let me concentrate on studying. You kept telling me you wanted to kill me and end it all. I still don’t know how I didn’t do it. GAD actually helped. There were times when I was in such despair, thinking about offing myself, that GAD would pop up and tell me how afraid of death it is. Sometimes Depression didn’t give a shit, and yelled louder. The main reason I suppose was the real me, my empathy, not letting myself do it because I knew how badly it would hurt my family. Thank goodness I ignored Depression, Depression is still around, I manipulate it. I take advantage of it and try to channel it into sometimes creative/constructive. Sometimes I get diddly squat




**Next up are GAD’s siblings. SAD (Social Anxiety Disorder), you make me panic when I try to play an instrument infront of people. You made me fail music class. I knew the songs forwards, backwards and inside out. But you rendered my fingers speechless. You also make things difficult for me to do anything social. You make me spend a lot of time hidden away. You suck. But we’ll get through it, one day it’ll be okay.



HA, I REFUSE to google every little thing that pops into your thoughts. Keep it to yourself please, it’s stressing me out. 



PD, SAD goes away completely, you made me ask a stranger to borrow their phone. The worst panic attack you gave me was at my relatively new job. I hadn’t had a panic attack like that before. I had experienced all the other symptoms before, except the going numb part. My arms, legs, stomach went tingly and I lost feeling in them, and my fingers and toes cramped up so bad, my co-workers probably thought I was a freak. And the people in the ambulance, and I know what it is



**So back to the parasite that has been giving me the most grief as of late.** I don’t know for sure, it reads deeper meaning into them and assumes the worst. If my SO smiles, it tells me he’s happy because he’s been talking to another girl. If he’s ever texting anyone or on facebook or whatever, it tells me he’s flirting, or making plans to meet up with another girl. It tells me the people I live with are trying to kill me, poison my food when I’m not looking. If anyone says ANYTHING, it reads ridiculous meanings into them. I know that it’s ‘it’ thinking those things, but the real me doesn’t




**Then there’s the little gem of the family. The one I love, and makes me appreciate all my other favourite things even more. When Up is awake, Depression is asleep, so is SAD, PD and HA. “It’ and GAD are still up, but cower in the shadow of Up. Up doesn’t give a shit what they say. Up is a ray of sunshine. Up fills me with energy, motivation, happiness, working on at least 10 things at a time, and trees. But when it does make me talk




**Just one day** of feeling that way



I started this letter with horrible feelings. I felt so sad that I’ve never met anyone who can understand what it’s like to go through the bad things, paranoid etc if I could. I do my best. I rarely act out on it. I almost never act out on my anger, because the real me keeps reminding me that if I wait and calm down, I will know that the anger is not me, it’s “It”. Occasionally it’ll spill a few words out my mouth. Never anything mean, just speaking how upset it is as it thinks I am hated. On the outside I appear relatively normal. On the inside it’s absolute chaos. It’s not as easy as just turning it off. All I can do is try to dismiss all the horrible thoughts and feelings and keep distracted, and not let the parasites control my actions too. I do try my best, but sometimes it gets completely out of hand and I let my cover slip a bit.



**To the people close to me



If this happens, so please don’t be mad. Please don’t put me down. Just because you’ve experience anxiety a few times in your life, doesn’t make you an expert. That is just a bit of anxiety. Not pleasant yes, but believe me, having the disorder is quite different. I’m not mad I swear. I wish you all could understand, but you cannot and it’s not your fault. It’s because you’ve never experienced first hand the chaotic mess off it all, and I’m glad you haven’t. It’s hard to empathize I know. In fact, and if I unintentionally let my guard down and complain a little about it



**And please don’t taunt me



**Remember it’s not me and it’s not my fault. It’s not even a part of me
 They are just parasites in my brain. Messing up my chemicals. And I’m doing the best I can with that.**

I thought I was 'okay' for the last few days. I've been hanging out with friends, but I'm told there is 'light at the end of the tunnel'. We had a lot of good times, and a lot of bad ones. Oddly enough, I can remember the good times the best. I don't think I'll ever forget laughing with you until it hurts, or how it felt at the top of 'love' mountain. I never wanted you to be a distant memory in my past, but that seems to be okay with you. The constant fighting and bickering over menial shit sounds so silly now. We used to have something amazing, and the feeling was incredible. Then again

I only can wish things would go back to how they used to be

It's not like I didn't see this coming. I can't even count on my hands how many times we have gone through this. When we first started dating you broke up with me within a WEEK because someone told you a lie. We got back together but within a month you ended it again, did I feel like this. I could hear it in your voice this time, we are done for good. 

I loved you being there to support me. I wish I would have treated you more like a 'princess' throughout this entire relationship, I was too good for that. 

After we graduated Highschool, and even had a good lead with one.  You were talking to other guys too, and would regularly brag about making out with dudes at the club. I skipped your graduation party to hang out with that girl, but got burned in the end. Later that night I caught her making out with my best friends bro and it killed me. I remember they put my drunken self in b's old room, then I called you crying and calling you the wrong name. You didn't hang up on me, and listened until I fell asleep.

Then it happened. The next day I woke up at B's and drove back to my dads. My mom called me while I was sitting at my computer, and I had no one. After I went and hung out with the family for a little bit at my Aunts, I came home and you came over. You laid with me in bed and rubbed my back as I sobbed. You were my angel and I miss that. We stayed together for a 2.5 years after that, until now..

 I don't see us getting back together again, but it might just take me a while.

I feel stifled.

I never asked for this. I never wanted to come home every night and update you about what I’m wearing, and I’ve been up since 6:30 for class— that’s why. I hate that when I’m upset, all you do is probe and push and make assumptions about how goddamn bitchy I must be and how much I must fucking hate you. It can’t possibly be that I need space, like I’ve always needed for all the fucking times I’ve been down. No, it’s probably because I’m a childish heart-stomping whore who can’t stand telling you every single fucking one of my thoughts.

I don’t have room for melodrama and neediness. I don’t care that you’re “updating” your OK Cupid account. I hope you find some fantastic OK Cupid girl who never parties, “I don’t want anything exclusive,” and does everything you want her to do. I hope she sits quietly at home humoring you and your requests and waits by herself while you “go out” with your stupid ex-girlfriend that you were so hung up on less than a year ago. And I hope to god she never walks out of line for fear of stepping on your sensitive little heart.

When we met so many years ago I was so infatuated with you.  I had a serious crush for sure.  But I was seeing someone and I knew you wanted more.  I was so young and awkward

Then I saw you.  I wasn't completely sure that is was you until you noticed me outside.  My stomach started to flip

We Facebooked... I tried to keep a distance.  I had made a decision previously to not allow another intimate relationship in my life until my daughter was 18.  It had just been too hard.  Too taxing on my soul.

Your smile is infectious.

I gave in.  That first night we hung out was excruciating in so many good ways.  I felt such an strong pull towards you.  Did you feel it to?  After that I would just try to find  ways to get you to want to hang out with me again.  It wasn't difficult.  That first kiss.  After all this time

We could have conquered the world.

This past week.  What I would give to live it over and over again.  But it all ended as abruptly as it started.  The news.  Is the entire world against me?  Why did I have to let you in?  Do I even care?  Even if I told you that it didn't matter

It has been so long since I have felt this way and it was so wonderful.  I don't want to be sad anymore.  I want to love you.  All of you.  To show you that someone out there loves you for everything that you are no matter what.

I will probably never get that chance.  I will probably never find this again in my lifetime.

P.S.  I can't help but get the feeling that you want me to hate you.  It seems like you think it would be easier if I could hate you for this.  I am sorry but I can't.  I wont.  I wasn't even going to text you today.  YOU TEXTED ME.  And then silence.  Just be honest with me.

When we first broke up

I spent the last three months thinking like that.  I tried, in hopes of salvaging some level of self-respect.  I turned down the opportunity to enter several relationships on the theory that I was saving the girl from the inevitable pain of my failures (Even when the girl in question was far more compatible for me than you ever were).  I considered myself to be fundamentally broken as a person, and every time I saw you at work reinforced that belief a little more.

I’m done feeling like that now.  For various reasons I won’t go into here

You used me.  Our entire relationship was you using me.  It started because you enjoyed the ego trip of dating a much younger guy, and even after all else had failed you waited to break up with me until I’d finished all of the outstanding projects you needed done around your house.  You knew how easy I was to keep content (all I wanted was company and occasional sex) so you took advantage.  I was a toy, a tool, and a salve... but I was never an equal.

Not only did you use me, building projects in my spare time, and generally spent almost all of my free time improving myself.  I drank occasionally but always responsibly.  With your encouragement I stopped doing all of those things… I became an alcoholic right alongside you, stopped building things, stopped eating healthy, and worked out a whole lot less.  I don’t think you liked the idea that I was better than you in some respects, so you tried (succeeded) to drag me down to your level.  Then you used all of those things you had encouraged me to do as an excuse to justify breaking up with me.

Do I think you did these things consciously?  No.  But the fact remains that you did them

In a way, thanks to you, finally stand on my own in every aspect of life.

Does that mean I forgive you?  No.  The way you acted for the last year did some severe damage to my life, thanks to you… but at least I finally trust myself.

Goodbye

Sincerely

1358182890.0,16k4iw,Know that we'll always be friends.,enderbund,16,3,1,"Hey.

I hope you are well.

I have no idea why I'm contacting you

It's sad that two people that brought eachother happiness can also hurt eachother.

I cut you off because I couldn't handle the break-up. I'll use Pink Floyd to say I ""built a wall"". I became ""comfortably numb"". Maybe I want closure now. Evidently I'm not over you. I was and am very mixed up about the whole thing and had massive guilt issues to the point of feeling suicidal. I don't expect people to understand, you did tell me you don't get the ""guilt stab"" that people talk about when hurting others. You are also psychologically manipulative. That's your problem for which you should seek help to address. In any case, my depression has carried on for about a year since I broke up with you, and I've been for counselling, therapy, and am now seeing a psychiatrist, with a view to start a course on some form of antidepressant. I often don't like myself.

When we were going out, but I was also smitten with you. I'd have listened to you say most things. I wanted to protect you and love you better. I tried to succeed where you said they had failed. Part of me still does, which I don't think is healthy for me.

I hold you in such high esteem for your intelligence and beauty, I reached out for help from you and you kicked me when I was down. Don't do this to others when they don't meet your standards. Are you sorry for doing this? I think that with a little empathy and support I could have gotten back on my rat and ridden to Camelot. Or something. Learn this or learn to stay away from people with any weaknesses, or there will be a lot of pain in your wake.

I started to set standards for you, and I ignored that which I knew was incompatible about you to keep the relationshit ""alive"". I think I'm closer now to accepting you for who you really were.

With this in mind, I feel I was much more myself when we were friends. That's how I'll remember it.

I've had a year and a half to push these feelings as far away from my mind as I could. For awhile, I accepted that you were with someone else and I accepted that I'd never wake up next to you again.

Unfortunately, but nobody else is you and that's proven a problem for me. Even so, I let go and I stopped thinking about you a million times a day, I stopped checking your tumblr and your last.fm religiously.

And then I saw you at that party a few weeks ago. It was the first time I'd seen your face for longer than a passing moment in over a year. I felt gutted.

And then you emailed me. I nearly had a heart attack before I even clicked on the email. It was just common pleasantries

Five steps forward and ten steps back. A mutual friend told me the other night that you broke up with your girlfriend. Maybe you were just contacting me to be nice and to catch up

Just the fact that you thought of me made my head spin. There is no bone in my body that wants to stop talking to you

But the thing is, I want to tell you that I miss you and that if you'd ever take me back, I'd shamelessly come running. But that's not an option and I'm fully aware of that. I write these words here so that I do not send them to you, making it impossible for us to ever be civil or to ever have a friendship down the line.

So

Even so, after all this time, I am ready to love you so much better than I did the last time around. We ended things on an ellipsis and the story we began is one I'd like to finish someday.

You think it may ""please"" me to know that all of this happened only because you lied, for lack of a better word, became you? Because you were too busy hiding lie behind lie to protect yourself from everyone who cared about you? Yeah. It makes me feel so much better to know that you've grown up, you've moved on, and that you're not acting like you used to. Surely, that helps me come to terms with how selfish I must have been when I asked you to put the idea of marriage on hold until, you know, it helps me come to terms with being a piece of shit, hey: that never actually happened. All those tears didn't have a purpose. All that shame didn't have a reason.

Let me understand this: You expect me to believe that you did and said those things BECAUSE you loved me but were afraid of being happy?
Thanks

You want to ""counter your bad actions""? You want to apologize? Apologize to my parents who couldn't understand why, to needing a therapist - much less the rest of what they endured to watch after my breakdown - all in a matter of weeks. Go apologize to Jade who still hates me after you threw her under the fucking bus so that you could keep telling yourself nobody cared about you. Go apologize to my best friends, who I cut away simply for trying to help me. Apologize to those who I lashed out at when they tried to comfort me. Apologize to those who I broke down right in front of, none of them truly even knowing why. Apologize to my manager, who took me aside and listened for hours as I spilled my fucking guts out, after she noticed the self-inflictions on my arms and neck.

I wanted nothing but to love you. I wanted nothing but to be there for you. I wanted nothing but to care about you the way that you insisted nobody would, even right now writing this. I'm ashamed at seeing red for hours after you sent me your explanation of why you wouldn't take my phone calls. Do you remember that? ""Sorry, I was too busy getting my brains fucked out.""

I'm ashamed that I've let myself become emotionally crippled, and refuse to let anyone get close anymore. I'm ashamed that I find something to hate about every girl I've ""dated"" ever since then because I go out of my way to find things that remind me of you. I'm ashamed that I called it off once simply because a girl said she had family in Arizona, or rejected a girl because she might have looked a little too much like you. I'm ashamed I couldn't admit that to their faces. I'm ashamed that I can't glance down Foster Avenue without wanting to fucking wrap my car around a tree because I'd think of you. I'm ashamed that I feel like leaving flowers for a girl as a surprise is the most sickening trope in the book, because all I can remember is how excited I was to leave them for you. I'm ashamed that you have robbed an entire night of sleep from me as I wrote, and rewrote this more times than I can count now. I'm ashamed that I've been thinking about this letter for sixteen hours now, and how I would trade anything in the world to have them back. I'm ashamed that I'm ignoring every sensible part of me that is screaming at me to not write this, a tiny little part of me is begging me to beg you for another chance at starting over and trying this all again, too.

You made me hate myself.
You made me realize that I was just another piece of manipulative garbage
You put me on a path of self-destruction far greater than I understood at the time.
You instilled on me one mantra, prove it. If you love me, prove it. If you love me, prove it.
I obviously never succeeded, I was only trying to ""get into your pants.""

You've got your life set down now. It's what you wanted.
You've got your husband
You've got your school
And in the end

I don't want to believe you are sorry. It nullifies too much pain. Believing you could want to go back and start over leaves me open to more manipulation, the truth is that deep down, I want to believe you, because for fucks sake, I loved you and I hate that I still love you, if only because I still hurt this bad over it. I want to believe you because I promised you I would be there for you no matter what, because I was loyal. And you know better than anyone that I stuck it out for you far longer than any human should have to endure. Boyfriend or husband or not, because you couldn't understand what it meant to love someone. You don't deserve to understand love. You don't deserve the privilege

I want so badly to get closure with you, and I want to as well, oh god how I want to.. maybe this will help:

I hope you know that I haven't forgotten you, that summer night in the grass. All those emotions that I couldn't understand. Getting in trouble for staying out till 1 in the morning when I had to be home by 9. 

Then, on that bench by the creek. Walking home, with a huge smile on my face, oblivious to the freezing cold around me. How could I forget the days we sat together and talked for hours, about everything.. The midnight calls from you and your drunken best friend, asking about my roommate. 

How could I forget: Those nights we met up in the cemetery
The night your mom caught the 4 of us at 3 AM with wine and cigarillos.. 
Passing notes in Anatomy class
The 'walks' we went on.. how we kissed each other
When you told me about what happened to you in Mexico. Something that no one knew. How horrible it was
You were the first girl to tell me that I was attractive
How I cried in the airport when I read your letter. How much we skyped over Christmas break.

I can't forget that one of the first thoughts when I broke my arm was that now I could spend more time with you

Then when you told me about what you did over the break, scared of losing you.. I didn't know how to react. As if cheating on me wasn't anything to bother about. But we weren't ""official"" because we were both scared, you more than I, of what it meant.

We drifted apart, until it couldn't last any longer..

I know I will never forget the pain of first heartbreak. Wednesday. The retching pain that tore me apart inside when we were over.. I couldn't eat, it was like another knife in my heart, but I had to get over you.
We didn't speak for weeks..
 
Then, we rekindled, after I told myself I would stay away from you. We even went back to that church, you played the piano and it reminded me of the days after school, at your house. It was all too much. Then you wrote me more letters, explaining even more of what happened to you. We sat next to each other in silence, in that big hall. 
As we became friends again and when we caught the other couples kissing

Then our trip to London.. I avoided you, I lied to him in front of you, because I didn't want you to know I still had feelings for you. Then you walked in on me in the shower, I never told you this, but I did that on purpose. I knew somehow that you were going to come to use the bathroom, I left the door unlocked and I knew you would come. Then how you later told me that you wanted to stay in the bathroom with me, but didn't. I laughed because that's what I wanted too.
Then the plane ride home, what the hell did it mean? I thought we were over.

Spring time came around, walking in the water. All the little things we did together, I can't forget them. 

Then how we drank that bottle of wine and kissed like we'd never kissed before

The last time I saw you, promises of the future were made, we would reconnect somehow. I gave you one of my favorite sweaters, you were so hot to me when you wore it.. 

Then, which is what I wanted, 5 months earlier. The first day were were officially dating I had to call you long distance with my sisters phone to ask what was wrong, because something was.

How could I forget your best friend told me what you did in that first month. I was the reason you and her couldn't be friends, all I heard was lies.. 

I broke up with you, it wasn't how I wanted to do it, over skype in a coffee shop. 
You meant so much to me, but to me.. you were the best. 

2 weeks later

You haunt me. I am always reminded of you and I hate it. I think I loved you. Now I feel like I wasted a year and a half.. I laugh now
I told you I wanted to be your friend still, a whore and much worse.. I said you were better than that. I said you were a diamond in the rough, but after everything happened I'm not so sure. You told me that I changed you, for the better.. That I was someone who made you want to be a better person, but you really make me think otherwise. 

I hope your happy

Sometimes I wonder if you knew what was happening the whole time
I'm sorry for what happened to you

Damnit. I just want to move on from you.

If you ever see this I hope you don't think me crazy for picking this up again but I am both a writer and an artist and I tend to obsess over things until they are well and truly dead
I looked over my old journals some time back and it made me cringe how often I wrote about you. I remembered things  I had already forgotten about you.
I'm not sure where I'm going with this-let me try again.

I don't know where you are now. I don't know if you're still with Maddie or not but I do hope you're well.

One year and one month ago I told you I loved you. And the next time I saw you you were holding her hand. The months wore on and I saw you kissing her and interacting with her daily at school. I was never jealous. First of all I considered her to not be within a hundred yards of your type, you were never mine to lose. It would be silly of me to be so angry and jealous over something I had never had in the first place. I knew that because I was fat I would never be anything more in your eyes than what I already was. Don't deny it-the greatest benefit of being a quiet person is that you become skilled in people watching. When I was in love with you I had a bad habit of watching you when no one else was looking, and you were always hanging around those pretty types. The tiny, thin, pretty and loud girls who played helpless and dumb to get your attention. I was always the opposite. Tall, fat, quiet, because they were

We didn't talk often but when we did it always left an impression on me. I was convinced you were the kind of guy I wanted and I could tell others thought we would make an ideal couple. But in the end I was never an option. I was bitter at first until I realized something. You watched me all the time. During lunch, I don't know but I sure noticed it. You tried making me jealous and when that didn't work you settled for watching from nearby which I wasn't aware of at first until that day your girl friend decided to sic herself on me. Not cool, by the way. Practice subtlety for the next girl, it's the least you can do. 

Graduation came and went, up until one year ago we got along so well; you were everything I could ever hope for in a guy. We both sing and play instruments, we both whistle, love Pokemon and HIMYM and countless other things. Whenever I was near you I was myself-you were the only person who ever brought out the best in me. And I can't help wondering that if we both hadn't messed up so badly, would it have worked out? Would you have given me a chance? Would I have trusted you?Would we still be together even if you're in Iowa and I'm in Michigan? I'm bitter. In fact, I'm angry. I didn't realize before-I guess I really needed to say this. I only wish I could see you so I could say it to your face. I'm not ashamed in saying it.

There's no way of knowing. I'll likely never see you again unless you decide to show up to our high school reunion which we both know you won't do. 

 Now that I've lost weight and feel way better about myself than I did then (take note that I've done all this for myself and for no one else), now that I'm starting not to.

So I say to you again: Good luck. Go ahead and study engineering and date more petite girls because they make you feel needed. Here's a secret: tall girls can do that too. Go ahead and play guitar for them as they sit and smile while I would have sung along and maybe danced horribly as well, laugh when she at the faces she makes that no one else can see. When you're with the girl you're going to marry, ask yourself if she does any of those things. I hope you remember me then, and realize that for a while, we were perfect for each other.

When we are together you seem to have so much fun and really enjoy us as a couple

But when we aren't

I know it doesn't help that you do work a lot. It makes it even worse when you're moving state in just over two months for your career. But I would be willing to move with you if we could make something of this.

I've tried my hardest to see you more and I really do want that. You say you do too...but I don't know if you really mean it.

It could be just I have the worst timing ever and you're too busy with work and getting ready for the shift.

Or it could be that you're not actually interested and you're just lying to both of us.

I offered for you to come to Christmas lunch - you declined to spend it with your friend who will be alone as well. I can respect that. But at least give me another time that you are free to catch up!

While there are some little things that cause barriers between us seeing each other more often I really want to make it work.

But maybe I shouldn't - because I don't want to be strung along. I just want you to tell me where we are at so you aren't in my head 24/7.

1353646701.0,13njys,To the guy I met at the gym,letsmakethisright,16,3,9,"
3 weeks ago you approached me unexpectedly at the gym. You told me some of the nicest things anyone has told me in a while. You gave me your number

When you caught a glimpse of me at the gym, for ever coming across someone so beautiful. Want to know what I would say? Unlucky for you. Of all the pretty faces out there, mine was the one you caught, and that is why you are unlucky.

Everyone that has ever gotten to know me has come to the abrupt realization that I do not and will NEVER fit the mold of someone that is attractive. I've been told it's ""the halo effect""; letting someone's physical beauty influence other elements of their being - thinking that someone attractive is without fault. But then there's me, immature, borderline childlike tendencies. Yes, there you have it: Me. Factor in the physical attractiveness and you have two opposite ends of the spectrum comprising a single person. A person that baffles her acquaintances; a face that oftentimes, is unrecognizable even by its wearer.

The way I am has definitely caused me problems over the course of my lifetime, often leads to more problems that one could ever imagine. First, there are the assumptions before someone even meets me; for the guys, a beautiful, faultless girl. And for the girls, mostly the same - although this makes me idealized by the former and hated by the latter. And then when they do meet me it's even worse: The guys come to the conclusion that I am ""different"" (seriously, this has been said to me numerous times) and although this is intriguing for a while, they instantly realize that I am not someone that glides to and from rooms

I guess this explains why I never bothered to call you, only to taste chocolate, and be disappointed by it. I am not ashamed of the person that I am, but the effort put into these comings and goings are taxing. It would be much easier on both you and I if you simply remembered a beautiful girl that never called and I, a nice guy that just wanted a chance.

I had a dream that I was coming to see you. It was exactly how I had pictured it all in my mind. Me getting off the plane, grinning ear to ear. I ran up to you, flung my arms around you. I had tears in my eyes. And you got down on one knee, and said ""listen, I know we said we would wait but... will you marry me?"" 

And then I woke up. In my cold

That's how it's been for the past month now. I wake up alone. No good morning texts. No meandering thoughts about the day. I miss it. I guess. But it is my fault

Sometimes I get angry. The mean things you said to me were inexcusable. When you told me that I was going to regress without you

But I promise that I'm still here. I'm still waking up every day and going to work. I still exercise. I still eat healthy. I'm almost to the weight I wanted to be when I saw you again. I look really pretty... for the first time in my life. I think you would think I'm beautiful. 

And I'm going back to school next semester. Biochemistry. I'm actually starting to shadow a few doctors. I want to go to med school. I want to help people someday. I think you would be proud of me. I'm doing everything that would make you proud. 

I wish you weren't gone. I wish I could still hear your laugh, the way you used to hold me close to you while we slept. I miss it. I can't believe I messed up so badly. I tried to fix it, I hope you know that.

My love
There are so many things that I want to say to you. Things that I know will only make things between us harder. I can't stop loving you. I can't stop being in love with you. There are thousands of miles of water and land between us but every moment of my day I try to stretch my arms farther and farther trying to reach you. And now it seems that I can no longer call you mine. I can call you my friend (at least I hope I can still) I can call you by your name. But I can't call you mine. I know that you are going through a lot of things right now. I know you need to rebuild you before you can think of trying to be with anyone else. I know you think you're losing you mind and that you are a fuck up. But you're not a fuck up. You are the most wonderful man that has ever existed. You have inspired me to open my eyes to the world around me and try to spread happiness to others. I can't begin to describe how deeply you have touched my life. From that first ""hey"" my life was altered. A new path paved with bricks of truth and love. Then it all fell apart. I can't help but feel that it's my fault. I threw my problems into the pool of your mind and made it over flow. I'm truly and deeply sorry for that. You are my reason for breathing every day. And now I can't claim that anymore. I want to be what you need me to be for you, I know i'm not what you need. You said I deserve someone stronger, someone who can be here for me and hold me when i'm breaking. The fact is though there is no one else that I want. You are the one I want to hold me when my tears fall, the one I want to have their arms around me when I wake shaking from my nightmares. But I can't have that. It seems as though that is something I can never have. For what seems like a lifetime I've been waiting for someone to come along to show me what compassion and true love is. I thought you were that person. I thought things would be different. I was wrong. I'm okay with that. I understand what you need. I know it's important for you to get your life together. I know you have to learn to love yourself before you can love anyone else. Did you really truly love me? Or did you only think you did? Was I wrong about that too? So many times you said it so many times you wrote it. 
This past month when you were getting help
I don't know how to go on right now. It's like someone has just ripped my chest open and just has there hand around my heart, maybe my purpose in life is to help others pick up the pieces of their lives and move on. Maybe i'm meant to become a distant memory. All I know is that I've been left standing here with my heart shattered around me, and I can't put it together because i'm out of glue, I gave it all to you so you could put your head back together. And I don't know if I want to put it back together anymore. It's just been shattered so many times and some of the pieces have gone missing. 
I'll end this unsent letter. I don't know if you will ever read it. You might. If you do know this, I always will be. There is not any other person in this world who I want to be with. I can't pretend that I don't feel this way for you. I will do my best to be your friend and not complicate things. ""I have loved for a thousand years, I'll love you for a thousand more.""

When I was child I used to think when I became older things would get better.  I remember thinking when I'm an adult I'll be free of this.  I'm still waiting.

As I'm getting older the realization of the reality of my situation is abundantly clear.

After 33 years things never got any better.

I grew up in a home with a man that used to beat my Mother with pieces of wood

When I started puberty the abuse turned into something more.  He tried touching me

I got out.  I thought I was free.  But I entered a relationship that was similar to my Mother's.  He hurt me for 9 years

I married a man that I thought loved me.  He cheated, he made me feel unworthy..

33 years.

If anything I've learned a few things.  Sometimes no matter how badly you want to be loved, nor do I really want to know.  What I do understand is no matter how much I loved the people in my life, I was never worthy of their love, their protection, their unconditional support; everything I had given them.

I wish I could tell you why I'm so fucked up. Why I suck at relationships, the flashes of memories that cause my panic attacks. I wish I could tell you why I slept around so much before we met. That it was the only way I could deal. The drugs, the alcohol, the cutting. It was always just a way to deal. To forget. To mask the pain. To pretend it didn't happen. But eventually I had to sober up, and there it was....the past staring me in the face.

I wish I could tell you about the abuse. But I try very hard not to think about it anymore. But it's hard. The reminder is always there. Heaven help that sick pervert if I ever see him on the street. I hope he dies the most agonizingly painful deal imaginable. 

I wish I could tell you what having drug addicts for parents was really like. Sure

I wish I could tell you how it felt, I just couldn't figure out why I wasn't good enough. How their custody battle just felt like a way for them to injure each other more, neither truly caring about me. I wish I understood why my grandparents love wasn't enough to make me feel whole. Why I still don't feel whole. 

I wish I could tell you how I found a way to deal. What the hell kind of person starts sneaking and drinking as a 8 year old? Seriously? How fucked up is that? And how fucked up is it that no one ever noticed. They were all just too drugged and drunk to know we even existed. Drugs started just a few years later. By 12, or a friend's. It was always there. I spend my weekends in a drunken drug-hazed stupor. 

Then back home and back to school I went where I had to act like little miss perfect. I hated having two lives. But I couldn't let them see me for who I really was. By then dad had remarried and she wasn't as blind as he was. Still, bookworm, nobody. Sure, I had friends, but very very few who ever even saw a glimpse of the real me. And I'm sure they thought I was bullshitting. That helped when my drinking began to spill over into my weekday life. Who would have ever suspected that bottle of water I kept in my locker was vodka? 

 I wish I could tell you that the reason I had sex for the first time at 14. How I decided it should be with one of my friends that I trusted and cared about instead of some random guy at a party when I was too fucked up to say no. I wish I could tell you that it was so awful that I didn't do it again for 3 years. But I'm glad it was a friend

 I wish I could tell you how that sent me into an awful spiral. How I threw myself into a relationship with J, and got my own revenge. At a party one night, I left him, and I took home his best friend instead of him. I honestly thought I'd just fuck M, and that would be it. Make J mad and jealous and move on. But then I fell in love, truly, for the first time. And less than a year later he broke my heart into a million pieces. 

I wish I could tell you that the almost two years between M and you was probably the lowest I've ever been. Sure, he didn't know all my secrets, but I allowed myself to love. I wasn't going to do that again. I refused to put myself in a situation to be hurt again. So casual dating, friends with benefits and dating married men is how I spend my time, sober or not. And there weren't a lot of the sober days during that time. 

And then, and agreeing to go out with you again. How I didn't know what to think when you didn't make a move that night. Or the next night. You didn't even kiss me until our 6th date. Definitely not what I was used to.

I wish I could tell you that I didn't mean to fall in love with you. That I did whatever I could to push you away. But you stuck around...and I fell anyway. You've not learned some of these secrets

I wish I could tell you, someone who is so much better than me. I know life hasn't been easy for you, you've had your heartache and pain too. But our upbringing was still like the blackest night vs. the warm glow of sunrise. 

I hope we can make this marriage work. I want it to. Because I can't imagine my life without you in it. I want you to be the one by my side as we face the world.

You're not an empathetic or introspective person. You've never had the opportunity in your adult life to really slow down and think about yourself. You've always been in pursuit of filling some kind of void. You recognize sorrow, but you don't know how it feels. Filling that void has always been extremely easy for you, and you've taken advantage of that at every opportunity.

You never truly felt the weight of what you did to [1], you strung [3] along to fill that void. Then there was me. Now, there's [5]. Whether or not anything is going on between the two of you is irrelevant. Whether or not there's intimacy or romance is irrelevant. It's still the same pattern. You found someone enamored with you, someone you can easily depend on, someone that will be there for you.

I told you, I didn't care if you were still with [2], I didn't care what was going on between you and [3], I just wanted you. I never considered that, down the road, there would be someone similar, who didn't care about me. I don't want to sound like [2], and there's something so inviting about you as a person. People feel comfort around you. People feel at home in your presence. It's so easy to fall in love with you.

That's allowed you to continue to live the way you have. And that will be the case for a while. You say you haven't been single in 10 years

I know from losing you, from living with the [burden], from losing my house, from losing my mom, but they've made me empathetic, but the only way to fix it is to be aware of it

You haven't felt the weight of dumping me, but you never felt the weight of that love, because you've never had to go without it. I loved you in a much more fundamental way, maybe partly because I understand what it's like to not be loved, but mostly because I could empathize with you as a human being, and I saw something extraordinary about you. You could never empathize with me, not really.

I'm just scared that you'll continue this trend. You have [5] right now, 10, 20 years. There will be a time, though, when you've exhausted the trend. There will be a time when someone breaks up with you. There will be a time when you have no one to lean on. Your friends and your siblings will have settled down. They won't want to go out every night, they won't want you around all the time. You won't meet someone that will so willingly and immediately live with you.

I fucked up. I'm sorry

It was a mistake. My mistake. Over the course of those short months you’d wiggled your way into deep, let alone access. And then I ran away because you’d tousled up my neat, comfortable hair and I didn’t know how to cope. My world was safe and stable for so long, but you, with your disarming blend of wit and boundless generosity, found a way in, in an invasion that was wholesome and blissful and atrocious all at once. Paradox was always your forte.
 
The thing is, but they were powerless against your unexpected, unselfish grace and unimpeachable kindness. These were strange, terrifying things, and I didn’t know how to respond, so I fled because, as you know, I always choose the latter.
 
What I didn’t stop to consider was that I’d be leaving you wounded and alone, you obliged. I needed space, I said. You rarely denied me anything, but I wish you’d denied me this. Maybe, possibly, things would’ve turned out differently.
 
During those weeks in another city, I discovered a better man, a braver man than I ever recall being. You believed in me, and somehow you convinced me to believe in myself, to believe in all those stupid, infantile, wonderful things that I’d given up on in the twilight of my youth. I started composing music again. And writing. I didn’t know it then, terrifying world was infinitely better than the fossilized sanctuary I’d trapped myself in. Solitude was my prison, broken-winged creature.
 
When I came back to visit, the ones you’d waited so long and patiently for, week after week, month after month. I wanted to tell you that not only was there a place for you in my world, but that there’s no place without you. I never got the chance because somehow, over the course of those brief, eternal and excruciating weeks, but your silence could not have been sharper. I knew that I’d come back expecting impossible things, though it was all I wanted, with hardly a protest to escape my stupid
 
I still agonize over that final moment
 
I fucked up worse than I ever did before. I’m sorry in a way that I never understood until now. What can I do? How can I fix this? What the hell am I doing? Tell me, anything. Because I can’t live in a world where our realities are mutually exclusive. Not after all this. And, above all--
 
Come back to me. Please.
 
Yours

I’m the girl who noticed the friend of the guy she was unofficially dating. The guy with the sweet smile (a smile I saw a few times and immediately stored in my mind);the guy with the blue eyes and with the smart

But crushes are not about just any guy right? Somehow
He represented an idea I had been able to avoid for so long and he had come out of nowhere. This scared the hell out of me because I knew I was not good enough and I was already damaged. I was dating someone I didn't truly love just because I had already messed up a previous marriage and needed an 'emotionally uninvolved' relationship for a while. 

I’m the girl who made a bunch of mistakes from that point on. I’m the girl who lied in order to get closer to her crush. I’m the girl who deceived him, drama wrong just because I had no control over my feelings. 

So he moved on. Without saying much

I’m the girl who cried days and nights thereafter. Not because of a rejection but because of my own actions (I never gave him a clear chance to reject me since I never presented my feelings as being truly mine). I had convinced myself that he was someone special and I had behaved like a child about it.

I cried so much because I would not forget him or forgive myself as easily and I didn’t. He stayed somewhere in my mind. 
He still lives there and I need him to go away. 

Years later

So, or true love. A partner who is every now and then fighting against his girl's fantasies and impossible dreams.

This girl needs help. This girl needs to erase something from her mind before it ruins her life forever. 

I’m the girl begging for a favor. I’m begging my crush to return and break my heart. I’m asking him to take a few minutes of his life and to please reject me loud and clear.

What you left me with, doubts and self-regret. 

I know it is selfish of me but would you please help me?

LOATHE is not a strong enough word. You have made my life a living hell. I’ve had to tell those stories to the love of my life and it was humiliating. The first time you got physical, you’d shove me harder, two or three times, you’d hit me. I suddenly got ver talented with a make-up brush and long sleevesd shirts. The day you threw me down the stairs at your mother’s house and I slammed into the door. The time we went to the Sears Festival, I met a few friends.. some of whom were boys.. and you lost your shit, you punched me in the face, grabbed my hair and pushed me onto the sidewalk... but a chunk of my hair stayed in your hand. The day I finally dumped you. You followed me for blocks in your car, you swung your door open and hit me with it, he helped me up and I ran. I have issues beyond issues from what you did. I have flashbacks of what you did to me, but I have to remind myself sometimes that he deserves every ounce of my trust. You have destroyed

A couple of weeks ago you came to me wanting a simple couple-page site that would be a business-card site for a product you're developing and that you don't have any cash. I told you I don't mind giving you a few hours of my time for free. Since the product is aimed at parents who are potty training their kids

We finally agree on the functionality (basic pages) and I asked you to shoot me your ideas and I would get the design going and give you a mockup. Instead you send me ""final"" artwork in a weird format that looks like shit. I now want to scream not only because I would never had agreed to doing this site with your artwork (i'm tired of teaching people)

Anyways

Since then you keep asking for more and more ""little favors"" that have each taken a couple hours to complete and I'm starting to feel taken advantage of and I'm sick of it.

We both discovered the joys of reading The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy together and you introduced me to Kafka. 

I told you, I'll always be there for you. I respected your decision because I respect you deeply as a person and you spoke the truth.

I'm sorry I was abusive to you. I called you mean names, it does not warrant that sort of verbal abuse. We were wrong for each other and only brought out the worst in one another. I should have not tried to force everything and make it work. It was like putting two wrong pieces of the puzzle together.

I should not have tried to put myself more into the relationship when I wasn't really ""into"" it. I shouldn't have lent you money to put as a down payment on your car. I shouldn't have accepted the engagement ring.

It is hard to understand why everyone is so mean to you.  I know how painful it is, what they will be like in 20 years, and what you would like to do to them to get revenge and hurt them as much as they hurt you.  I know how unfair it all is.

There is nothing I can say to make it OK

I know you are scared of them.  I know you think you are different from them, but what matters more is what you think.  Here is a secret of theirs: they all hate themselves, too.  They all worry about their big nose, their bad haircut, their shortness, or freckles.  Here is another secret of theirs: they hide it.  This is the primary difference between you and them.  Not that they are pretty, cool, but that you aren't able to pretend to be something you are not.  This is why they hate you.  They want you to be like them, why they are so eager to bring you down

But they don't know you, your family, God, and your own self?  Your only fault is to not know yourself and trust yourself.  This is the very thing they all tell you every day.  Every time one of them calls you a name with that disgusted tone of voice, what he is really telling you is that you are not being true enough to yourself.  When you realize this, maybe you will even laugh!  Maybe this is one way God is speaking to you, to try to remind you of what is important to you.  Although the other kids' reasons for being mean might be one thing

The most important thing to remember is this: the things being said to you are lies.  They are not technically or figuratively accurate

In the end, too.  When you hide your fear, you don't allow other people to try to make you feel safe.  You keep other people out.  Is that what you want?  Or do you want a life full of amazing, interesting, lovely people?  This is the good part of you, your honest relationship with the world, and the benefits you get from it.  You have a much fuller life because of it.  Isn't that a beautiful thing?

Lastly, and anyone else.  You do have it in you.  Do it soon.  The less energy you put into them, the more you have for the rest of your life.

But that's not what I want to thank you for, I'm going to be travelling a lot, so unless I find a man who's willing to be dragged around, any marriage of mine would just fall apart. Why would I take such a sacred bond and destroy it? I know now. In the two years we were together you changed me view to ""No marriage, ever"" to ""Maybe marriage, if it's with him"". If you got down on one knee and asked me to marry you, I would say yes in a heart beat, I would say yes. You were my best friend, I guess we were just too young. I mean how could I possibly have thought this would have worked? We were perfect for each other

Regardless, except avoiding our bumps in the road, I would do it. I know this is probably not true, but I honestly don't see myself loving anyone as much as I love you. You aren't perfect, but that's why you were perfect for me. You made me feel safe, you made me feel wanted. Now I'm unsafe and unwanted.

You are sober. I’m proud of you. You’ve done this alone

You have your lawyer filing your divorce next week. Good. Why you’ve let her walk all over you for so long is something we need to face sooner than later

You’ve been doing really well with work. Pushing forward and taking care of what needs to be done despite the difficulties. 

You are doing well with your son. Keep doing what you are doing with him. You no longer need to fear that you will be like your father. You just aren’t.

OK so on to the fun stuff.

You hate where you live. Relax. It’s not so bad. It may be small

Your occupation is doing you no good any longer. It was the right choice at the time, and can most likely find something comparable financially, with the benefit of actual free time. 

It’s ok to be lonely. I know you struggle with it, and maybe one day you will find someone who isn’t just what you need, but needs you in the same way. 

Your depression doesn’t pass on its own. You need to eat more. Get some exercise. Feel good about yourself again. 

This is your life. No one is going to help you through it. Relying on others to do what is right is exactly how you got so messed up. You made their burdens your own and was left holding the weight. You forgive them

I’ve been wondering a lot about a lot of things lately. I’m still stumbling around the place, the things I want to create, the person I want to be, the person I am…

I’m always in conflict with myself. I tell myself that every minute of time given to me is an absolute blessing and that I cant spend a minute doing whatever I want to. but recently, on pointless daydreaming that serves no purpose other than to distract me from the work I have to do.

And with all these extraneous things clouding my thoughts, and I actually like it.

But a particular constant in my head have led my thoughts back to a few months ago. Back to those wandering conversations where it felt like a whole world opened up and I felt at peace with everything-when even the most careless, darker thoughts were dwarfed by the vastness of the universe, of the possibilities that I realized was out there. The warmth I felt when I realized that for once in my life, I can be exactly as I am. That I can tear off this mask that I’ve been forced to show others and reveal to someone else the raw form of who I am.

And it was in these moments that I shared with you that I finally felt at peace with who I was. And I miss that. I miss you. I don’t know if you check this blog anymore, if you’re trying to look for your own path. I’m just guessing that by the time you remember this and read back on these entries again, things would be clearer and simpler for both of us. I’m sorry I couldn’t do anything to help you feel better. But I guess finding answers is a task that should be done alone..

I was stupid to think I could move on so quickly. Really I was just covering up my emotions with a distraction. It didn't work. I broke down. I realized what I was doing. I ended it. Tried to get back with you. And you said no. 

Worst day of my life.

I love you. More than anyone. More than anything. I feel so empty now. I feel alone. I feel like I no longer have a purpose. I feel like I just pass through each day

Our break up was mutual more or less. We came to the agreement at the end of the horrible conversation. But I had legit reasons

But you said you couldn't change now or maybe ever. You said you couldn't give me the love, and sentimentality that I need and that it wouldn't be fair for either of us at this point. And maybe you're right. But to be completely honest, I don't want the same things I wanted before. For a minute, I was ""with"" a guy that ideally would be the perfect boyfriend. He wanted to take me shopping, he wanted and did go all out on Valentines day, he was cute and cuddly acting, he was sentimental, I realized that I didn't want all of that

Truth is

I had this realization about what was truly important to me. It's not the sentimental crap. It's not the cute texts. It's not all the stuff I wanted before. No. It's you. Everything about you. The good and the bad. Our similarities and our differences. 

I don't care about before. I don't care about what I wanted before. That's changed. I want to make things work for us. It's like we have both said

It still bothers me that you told me that I deserve someone better than you. It also bothers me that you told me that maybe with a little more life experience we can make things work down the road. First of all, not separate. I want to grow with you. I still want a future with you.

Let's be real here... you're not going to change. Frankly I'm not even sure why you said that. You're stuck in your ways. If you weren't

You said when you're finished with school

I don't really think you understand why I am so upset. I've been through quite a few relationships. I have always been the one to break them off and not once did I cry over them because I actually loved and missed them. Until you came along. Granted it took almost a month for it to hit me, I cried at the thought of losing you, I cried for things I never cried for over anyone. Usually when I'm done with a person, I'm done with them for good. The day we break up is the last day I ever speak or see them again. But I came back wanting a second chance. That's a big deal for me. Having that realization of, holy shit I actually love this guy, like real love, like love I can't live without

I don't want to share my life with anyone else. I don't want to be with anyone else. I don't want to take care of anyone else. I don't want to love anyone else. I don't want to be happy with anyone else. I don't want to miss anyone else. I don't want to fight with anyone else. I don't want to fuck anyone else. I don't want to become comfortable with anyone else. I don't want anyone else but you.

I have felt so empty since all of this. I have felt like a shell of myself

You wind up sitting alone in an apartment with the love of your life 50 feet away and she doesn't want to talk to you.

You know that girl we were talking about? Cherish her. Love her. She's the best thing that ever happened to you and you're going to blow it with alcohol and other women. You know how I know that? You're fucking depressed. Don't shake your fucking head like that. You know that's why things didn't work out with Cloe. You know that's why you have a shit relationship with Megan.

Oh, because you can do it, man. She's the smartest, most beautiful thing you'll ever see. And she'll be smarter than you ever thought about being.  And that girl? yeah, she's even prettier after she gives you the gift of a daughter. 

Remember how we were talking about alcohol and depression? Yeah

And when other girls present themselves in your life? Tell them to go fuck themselves. You're about to have the only two girls you'll ever need. Focus on your career. Focus on yourself. Don't screw this up.

So three things: 1) Don't go to law school; 2) Go to the doctor; and 3) Get your head out of your selfish ass and love this girl forever.

You said we would still be friends that I meant more to you than I knew. But your bf was getting the password to your fb account so I had to be ""careful"" about what I said there.

I am beginning to think that it might be better to stop being friends. Honestly I think it would be easier for me not to see you at all than to see you and not have you talk to me.

This isn't easy to say or type or...whatever.

	
I can't do this....I know I said I'd try....but this is different. Its not just    her.....I imagine its never been 
just her. I told you before that I never got jealous    of women because they never presented themselves to you in this way before. I  can't do this because I can't keep hoping that I'll be ok one day, If you were  sick...or hurt in any way and you needed me...I would have been there. I'd have  dropped all else to be there for you. You have shown twice in 3 days that you won't do the same. You left with her that first day I was sick. Then you do the same today. I would have been at your bed side the entire time, like I have in the past. I wouldn't have gone off with someone else or hell I wouldn't have even thought about myself getting sick because I was taking care of you. I would be there for you.....and its clear time and time again you won't be there for me unless its absolutely dire....and that difference is what makes for a best friend. You throw around these words like you know what they mean. I've been a “best friend” and believe me.....from what you've told me and from what I've seen, you haven't. I can't have half hearted best friends or even friends in my life now. In the past 3 days, I've seen you a total of about 3-4 hours. I bet you spent more time than that with her that first day I was sick. You might have been here yesterday, but you opted to stay away for your own safety. It may be a change that's so subtle that you'll deny it, claim that its not even there, just like I saw something between you too(remember how you denied that). You'll ignore it and be angry with me or call me dumb or crazy. Then it'll happen more, its not about her.....all of those “hers” in this message could be “hims” or a completely different “her”
	Look, I just can't. It hurts too damn much. I die a little inside when you call me baby. I know you've called her that. Whenever you want to hold hands or even sit on the couch together like last night.....It just stabs at me inside in a way you can't possibly understand.
	Now please understand that I'm not saying these things out of anger....I'm crying as I type this.....I don't want to let you go, but that is not what this is about, its about me,  taking care of me. And with you in my life.....I can't do that and I won't be ok.

I hope you understand well that I have a lot of emotional baggage. Most of it unneccessary as you would say

I am a doom not to be taken lightly. I will never be able to give you anything much in return for all you've done for me

I know, I'm not. I am simply a scared little one on the inside, a valiant noble who knows no bounds except in the face of danger, whatever that may be. A small speck of dust and carbon on this mysterious little planet.

Alien is what I really am. Alien to the customs of reality, even for someone of my caliber.

Please, what I am not proud of is making you sad with worry when you do not have to. So, from hereon even when I am troubled I will finally take up the rite of adulthood and admit it- I need to take responsibility for my actions. Even if it means hiding my pains and worries from you. Because no one but myself should have to deal with the things that go on in my life. No one should have to ever listen to me complain ever again. My opinion is useless, much like how I am except in times of need. I will finally admit it, I'm growing up.

**One. Meeting You.**

""I have everyone at this party figured out
""Me? Oh
""Bullshit. Josh over there is an observer."" He gestured to Josh, too-drunk, tight-chested on the couch between Meaghan and James. Meaghan and James were talking animatedly, drunkenly - lewdly. Swapping sexual war stories like you might see a bunch of old veterans do down at the local street café and bar - their Acapulco shirts fluttering about in the breeze generated by the hot air and howls of laughter emanating from their mouths. Red-faced, shameless, foul. Fun.
""Oh, what am I, then?"" I did my best to be inscrutable; put on a Mona Lisa smile, peeked out from under my bangs, unblinking. At the time, I didn't know what this looked like - I just knew I was being coy. Months later, he'd tell me the effect made my eyes ""happier... no, if you prefer."" Still later
""I haven't figured you out yet."" He was a little drunk
I smirked a sigh, leaned over to him, and whispered very quietly in his ear: ""I see you -- you're a bad person. But that's ok... I am, too.""


Strangely beautiful - not as I remembered him from the first day, and then he was gone. Like a figment of my imagination. ""I thought I'd imagined you"" we both said to each other that January.

And that's how it began. ""Strange"" as we both were - are. Strange as we continue to be - together

Still later:

""That's what this is, leaning into the table, saying terrible things, gauging the other's reactions.
""What's what?"" Eyes always locked. Our conversations important.
""Folie à deux.""
""What?""
""Insanity of two. Two people sharing the same delusions or hallucinations
""Oh... I don't know about that.""
""Then what?""
""We're the same person
""Maybe binary?"" I hadn't said it out loud before.
""Maybe. I think we're the same
""Oh
""You make up the humility.""
""Of course. Folie à deux... we make up for one another.


**Two. Open Letter.**

Dear Teal Wonder:

Why can't you seem to notice that I think you're wonderful?

I see your faults, often conceited, argumentative, reactionary, insane. You hold a grudge, smoke, bite your nails. You probably don't shave often enough - you're scruffy-looking. You are mean unnecessarily

I don't care that you're like this. I can't fix you

I don't care that you're physically imperfect in those ways you jokingly shrug off because you're self-conscious. It doesn't matter that you walk with a subtle limp that you hate and are embarrassed of; or that your one cheekbone is a little higher than the other because of a fight you got into in high school. I don't care if you're super-skinny because you stress to the point where you can't eat; I don't care that you drink too much coffee, you aren't comfortable in your own skin. Can't you see you're handsome? Can't you see you're beautiful? 

It breaks my heart a little every time you tell me you think you're stupid; you're ugly; you're undesirable; that you'll die alone. That you automatically assume I'll reject you. I only say ""no"" because morally it's the right thing to say to someone who has a girlfriend he hardly sees, I'd be the first person in line. Sometimes, you're exasperatingly idiotic. (I am too, though, so that's ok.)

Why can't you see that you aren't going to chase me away? Your jabs are insincere, afraid I already make you happy, and will probably continue to make you happy. I'm afraid of being happy, too, but I won't let myself fuck this up; we need to know each other. Can't you see that? Of course you can, you just haven't admitted it to yourself yet.

Why can't you just let me need you


I think you're amazing just the way you are -- to the point where it takes my breath away that you can't see what I see when I look at you


**Three. 3 AM text messages.**

""Your eyes glisten with the tears of Khruschev, who only pushes to pass the time. Your hand is firm, like that of Atilla, who would have painted the canvas of others. Your womb, the oven of Alexander VI, producing sweet bastards to shake the earth. Your feet are the faces of twice dead Jesus, he's coming back to find his wallet. Your neck supports the weight of Atlas, save that it stops the southward invasion. Your heart is the seat of animal secrets


**Four. Gentle Co-dependence.**

""Where are we getting supper?""
""Where would you like to go?""
""...We are getting supper
""I presume so.""
""[laughing]...We need to stop assuming each other's company. Oh dear god."" 


**Five. Serious Co-dependence.**

He pointed out a small advertisement in one of the local newspapers (low-budge') today

We looked at each other over S. and C.

S. and C. wanted to know what we were laughing about. We told them. They said
I looked at him, ""What you don't seem to understand is that I've been trying to take our relationship to the next level for months and months, but she just keeps friend-zoning me, man. But I'm persistent; I mean, just look at her. She's beautiful. Sometimes, when I look at her, I get that raw, especially because of his grand-standing streak and his theatrical tone


**Six. Conflicting messages.**

**A:** 

""Then why are you people here?""
""What do you mean 'you people'?""
""I love you?""
""I know.""
""Yeah. Yeah.""
""Sure
""You're the sister I never wanted.""
""I'm acutely aware. Though I would hope you wouldn't talk to your sister in the same manner.""
""...Well said."" 

**B:**

""He's a professor at the Centre for Medieval Studies at [university].""
""Ah. I almost went there for undergrad.""
""You should've.""
""Why?""
""We could've met
""Maybe. But I'm not Asian
""It was before I took a fancy to that category of the female population. It could've worked.""


**Seven. Leaving.**

""We're soul-mates. Two sides of the same coin. Don't you know that?""

""I want us to be eccentric old people; penpals for which the transatlantic postal system is obliged to stay open."" 


**Eight. The last time

We went to a yuppie restaurant

We had a 3-course meal. I had steak (was impressed with it, about knowing each other when we're elderly. We made plans; to see each other one last time before I move to England, regardless of whether or not the cottage plans he has with me are viable.

""I like it when older people get stuck fashion-wise
""Yes, 'nah, they're fine; they're just being themselves.'""
""Yes. 'Come back next week; we're in character. Don't you know?'""

He fed me some of his soup

He paid for my supper; that made me uncomfortable, though it was sweet. We sat in the window for the meal. We got smiles from older couples who walked by.

""What are we doing now?""
""We could always have a shotgun wedding.""
""I'm not pregnant.""
""We can fix that...? *deliberately creepy wink*""
""You're ridiculous.""

We got coffee; I only got an espresso. It was an excuse to prolong the hangout. We both knew it.

""What am I going to do without you around? Maybe I'll make you my muse. I'll muse upon you, I have to eat... even if I can't actually do art, per se.""
""You could very well do that.""



I keep joking, so sad. So, so hurt. He bends his face down, and looks up at me, sideways, like a sad puppy. I told him, ""I only joke because I'm sad."" He said, too... Maybe by the time you get back for Christmas

I'll never forget how you idly played with the the nail on my right right finger as you held my hand and stared into my eyes with the saddest of looks.


**Nine. Now.**


You're an idiot.


I'm an idiot.


We're really both idiots.



It's all so magnetic. Don't you feel it? Of course you do. I know you do. You told me so. We're just in semi-denial. You told me you'd be there on Monday. ""How could I not be?"" And then you said something jokey


It seems we both feel the pull all the time. It's unproductive. It's there.


I was trying to convince you to work hard to get the two dates we settled on free. I know you're studying for an LSAT rewrite, because I can feel your soul ache about it from here. You don't want to be a lawyer. But your parents want you to. And you don't want to be a failure in their eyes.

You said
""Ok. Stress that I am important and won't be around for 'like' a year.""
""They know you're important.""
""Do they?"" I really wish I knew what you said about me to them. It's a passive gnawing curiosity.
""Yes.""
""Good."" Then

I was the senior on the way out the door and you were the freshman seeing something new but already we could all see you knew who you were and against all that stubbornness you were amazing.  Another life and you might have been compared to a one dimensional California girl, and so much more.

I imagine the only reason we ever talked was because I had been friends with your cousin the year before.  I was thankful every day I had that ice breaker to start a conversation with you and eventually ask you out to see a movie together.  Of course I was too afraid to ever do anything or let you know how I really felt.  You were everything I wish I could have been and everything I ever wanted in a girl.  

We drifted apart immediately the day I moved away.  I was too scared to see what was in front of me those days and how much I should fought for something.  We started talking again years later but by that time it was as old acquaintances

Years have passed since we've last seen each other and every girl I have ever known has been compared to you. None of them have gotten close to being what you could have been.  You were the girl that made me want to go to school.  You were the girl that almost had me out of my self imposed shell.  You were the extrovert saving the introvert.  My best friend.

More than all of that I miss having you as my friend. 

I don't regret that I left. We didn't have a future together... I'm sorry but we really didn't. Our dreams are so different. We had an expiration date. We both knew it. 

If I could go back, I wish I understood why exactly you do. 

I know it's silly and pointless but I think about you. If I could be crawling into bed with you right now

I want you to know that you were a great boyfriend. Please don't lose that. I envy the girl who's future matches with yours. The girl who's totally and completely right for you. Whoever she turns out to be... she's a lucky girl.

She's not me though. I knew that and I still know it. 

Believe me

Half the time I wish we had never dated. Maybe we would still be friends. I would love that. Then again

I do love you... not in the way you wanted. But I want the best for you. Most days. Some days, but in the 'bring you beer when your girlfriend breaks up' with you way. I hope someone bought you beer when we broke up. It's weird, but I'm glad you rebounded so quickly. I hope that was a good experience for you. Oddly, I actually mean that.

I like you, and I was too afraid to find out. You were the dorky little girl, but I can never forget how great you looked in that red and black dress. That was the first time I felt attracted to you. I remember you said your mom thinks the red brings out the color in your eyes. I don't think any woman could have looked the way you did that day. We got to see each other almost every other day all this time, but we rarely spoke. But I was looking at you one day and you looked back. I still don't know what happened that day almost a year ago. It's hard for a guy like me to believe a girl like you would be into me. I always thought of you, but I could not speak to you. It would kill me every day to not respond to your long gazes. You put yourself out there so many times and I didn't say anything. I'm sorry. I wished you would stop doing this to yourself. I didn't believe our love could exist the way you did. I thought if I didn't escalate, no one would get hurt. But I feel the hurt every day. I'm sorry for all the hurt it must have caused you too. When I got back from vacation, you had changed your looks. I kind of thought you were with someone now. By the time I decided to correct myself, but you were practically gone by the end.

It's 2012, motherfucker, I'm the woman with the job supporting us, and there's nothing wrong with that.  Unfortunately, do all the cooking and cleaning

Since we broke up, you belittled me and told me I needed to be stronger, and only weak people have problems.  You made me feel unattractive when you wouldn't even kiss me without being asked.  You showed me no affection, and never told me you loved me (unless I said ""I love you"" first, and then you'd respond, but I never got the sense that it meant anything).  We didn't have sex for the last half of our relationship.  I tried to initiate - I bought lingerie, my hands would wander, unloved, with your constant belittling and thinly veiled insults.

I'm in a new relationship now.  He loves me, and I do the same for him (as I tried to do for you).  We have our problems like any relationship, but instead of pushing them aside, as you always did, we work through them.  We never go to bed upset with one another, even if it means we only get two hours of sleep.  He texts me randomly throughout the day just to say hello (without expecting anything in return, unlike you

I'm glad you're gone.  You thought you had broken me.  You tested me, and used the excuse of ""conducting a social experiment"" to be an asshole.  Even our mutual friends have determined that I deserve better than you.  They hate you for what you did to me.  They hate you for breaking me.  But I've put myself back together now, by leaning on the people I love for strength (something you always deemed weak).  I truly hope that you find whatever you're looking for.  I don't wish the worst upon you, because I'm above that.  Even after what you did to me, I have compassion.

I'm stronger now that you're gone.  I'm happier, because I don't have to be afraid that the smallest thing will set you off.  I am open.  I am honest.  I am compassionate.  I am a better person without you in my life, and I thank you for showing me just how wonderful and strong I can be.",,False,,t5_2seir,,http://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/14b3ns/youre_out_of_my_life_for_good/

We grew up together. We lived next to each other. You were only a little younger than I was

Your mom always joked we would get married some day

I remember the car/town rug/playmat you had. It was the coolest thing

And then we were growing up, though! We still hung out ALL the time, and when winter rolled around you would trudge through the snow to come sled on the hill with me.

Then you had to move again, and even though I was your only female friend you always invited me. I always invited you to Easter/my birthday to search for eggs and paint them.

Then MY family moved! We were closer again! Woohoo! We got to see each other more often, and listen to my suggestions for new books to read.

Years went by, but whatever. You always supported my choice of sax in band! 

And then that day came. I forgot my chorus folder, and she had left a note on it. ""Call me."" So I asked for the office phone and called her.

I have never gone from happy to suicidal so quickly. My mother told me that you died in a car accident. A drunk driver. I couldn't say anything, because she said goodbye and hung up.

I walked back to chorus and sat down. Then I stood back up and fled to the bathroom

I never ran out of tears

I wish I could have said goodbye

I wish it hadn't been in December.... you loved winter. It wasn't fair. it isn't fair.

you made me who I am... or was. I used to be shy

I went to collage. My first year

I walked up to a cab one morning, and I got their cab two other times. 

The third time I saw this dude

He has your name.

I stopped using cab services. I know it's stupid of me

I made sure I tipped him well that ride

I've been taught to be respectful, no matter to who.
As a matter of fact, I shrugged it off, and as you hurried out the door, I wanted to say ""bless you"" but you left so fast.
The doors closed.
I then realized you didn't accidentally sneezed at me. You didn't even sneeze on me purposely. You spit on my right arm and left your phlegm running down my jacket.

To the straphanger that spit on me, if they just lost their job, a loved one, are facing a divorce, are homeless or hungry, are troubled or simply down on their luck. What are you gaining from spitting on another person? Pride? Happiness? A sense of accomplishment? I almost feel sorry for you.

You, for those stupid cheesy memories from our photography adventures to our dances in my kitchen. I'm even more mad at myself for writing you a stupid sappy love letter that took four fucking hours. I don't do sappy or cute, I don't go running after people telling them to stay, but I did for you. So, because of you I'm mad at me. I'm mad at myself for letting someone like you. Someone who literally showed me how the world can be still beautiful even on my dark days of spiraling depression. 

I'm even more sad than angry though. I'm sad because we longer speak, I know I'll just start crying even more and not pick myself back up. I'm sad because you were the first person I actually let them see me, completely whole. I never did that for anyone. I'm sad that you cannot see how hard I'm trying to be successful at school, how I'm just trying to fight through this struggle called life. 

You made me feel happy, when were alone, I probably didn't show it either. I remember the stupid memories we have, the good ones, the bad ones and the completely idiotic ones that make me laugh. You were the one person that made me do things I'd never do for anyone else.

I can never see a South Park commerical without thinking of you, and those boxers you bought me are still in my drawer.  You are the reason I miss the east coast so much, not because of the beach or the fast lifestyle.  I would trade all of that for you any day.

Do you remember when you asked me what we were?  The words that came out of my mouth that day are the most regretable things I have ever said.  I should have just made you mine right then, got choked up, and didn't know what to say.  I think you realized how bad I felt when we had to say goodbye.  I never want to see you cry like that again.  I should have known I was making a mistake... I thought my family and friends here were worth it, but they really weren't.  When you leave home for a long time it's not always how you expect it to be when you get back.  I wish I could convey the emotions I have inside me to you in some way, but I can't even formulate the words to describe it.  I get a feeling that I don't belive anyone else has ever had when I think of you.  It's almost haunting.

I've learned a lot about myself sense we last saw, only this time I'm not running away, I'm headed straight into the depths of it.

Your boyfriend is my closest friend. I see the way you treat him and it upsets me. Obviously, and he can make his own choices-- but there are times when I wish I could tell you to have some respect for him. Last night you called him to say you were mad and you weren't coming over so he made other plans. I was hanging out with him when you called him repeatedly until he answered and then you yelled at him. You called him from his bed and demanded that he come home right then and bring ice cream. Seriously? You're a grown woman. 
I wish you would treat him like a person. He's a human being with feelings, and you drive around the block and come back. Even after he asks you to go, you refuse. You bug him all the time about wanting to live together when obviously that's something he doesn't feel comfortable with. He's trying to finish school. And sometimes, even in front of me, you ask him trick questions that have no correct answer. No matter what he says you're bound to get upset. How can you think that's acceptable behavior? 

 I see the way you get so caught up in things that don't matter very much. Yes, because he joked about sausages to a vegetarian. Look on the bright side: he has a sense of humor and he's great at cheering people up. There is nothing to be upset about. And if you think about it, really think, and there are still things worth getting this worked up about then dump him. You can't change who he is, and I'm not sure why you would want to.

And stop eating shit that i was clearly saving! do you know how frustrating it is to come home from 13 hr shifts looking forward to that last piece of my birthday cake

You are a truly disgusting human being. you never pay your bills and now my credit is taking the hit

You make the assumption that i always want you around. Fuck no. I want to get away from you. Stop assuming my friends are your friends. they aren't. My friends want nothing to do with you. I don't want you following us wherever the fuck we go

Stop trying to bond with me over depression. That is not something i want to share with anyone. Its a fucking disease, its not something you want attention for. Its fucking hard, and it never gets any easier. And on that same note, when my friends come to check up on me, they dont want to hear every fucking detail of every fucking problem that you have!

Stop trying to bond with me over my fucking piercings. No, hell, im not a badass, but for some reason you act like i am. Thanks for the compliment, but enough is enough. 

Stop telling me what you think everyone thinks you said. Just stop. My mom never mentions you. My dad never mentions you. they don't give a fuck about you, your job. NOTHING. You know what they care about? me. their daughter. Believe it or not, you do not come up in every conversation that i have. all of your ""oh, i bet they totally think im a bitch."" or ""oh, let me guess they were pretty surprised about my ____"" no. they didnt say that. You need to stop making yourself this grand being that haunts everyone's thoughts. 

Stop telling me that you can make every male friend i have gay. For the love of all that is holy, but they like BOOBS, and not man boobs like you have. No, you cannot make them gay. No, you are not this ""sexual god"" that you think you are.  No, my friends wouldn't ""totally sub for you"" Your are the furthest thing from the symbol of male dominance. No. Just fucking no. And stop arguing with me when i tell you they won't either. JUST FUCKING STOP IT. You are driving me fucking insane. 

Stop acting like a girl! oh my god

Stop telling me my cat loves you. She doesnt. Why else would she run for my room when you come home? She only puts up with you because when im at work youre the only one who can feed her. stop thinking youre taking her when we move out. Shes licensed in my name, i pay the bills for your cat. You can barely take  care of yourself, let alone anything else. 

When i come home from work i don't want to talk about my day, since when does quietly reading a book in my room indicate that i want you to barge in and start telling me every little detail of your entire life? Just leave me the fuck alone! 

Guess what? no, i will never in a million years get a house with you. I can't wait to get away from you. From your constant talking, from your constant hounding, from asking me for money that i don't have for stupid shit you don't need. Only 7 more months. I am gone as soon as i can get out.

I'm still hurt and I still miss you. It's not that neurotic ache of emptiness, so I tried to give you what I thought you wanted.

If you needed to sleep with someone else in order to know you wanted to be with me forever then I was okay with it. I could suffer the indignity. If, if it meant I had you forever. That isn't what you meant, you didn't want the opportunity to sleep around,  you wanted me  to tell you I wanted you all to myself forever and ever. You wanted to know I was still mesmerized by you. Wanted to know you were the only person for me. That I wanted to be the only person for you. I did. It hurts to know you're so much happier without me. It hurts to know you don't miss me. That I can't talk to you.

I didn't try to steal you friends or spirit them away. I never blasphemed your name. I never seriously belittled you to them. I teased in the manner I always have

Though you were 9 years older than me, though. If anything YOU were the one depending on me. I just enjoyed the company and believing that someone cared about me. Though, for the first few months the majority of our conversations were about how a previous girlfriend had smashed your heart a few years back, and was jerking you around again. You tried to pursue her, ended up hurt just like I'd predicted, and babbled on to me for months about how you just wanted someone to hold and reciprocate your love. 

Eventually we ended up together in a long-distance relationship, and I'm willing to risk it.* Even though you'd talked me out of suicide, I was still suffering from my awesome mental instabilities.

Anyway, wrong. After I spent 3 awesome weeks there, mostly okay with everything that went on, returned home, and you completely ignored me for weeks; I snapped. I went on a self-hate filled rampage of sleeping with other guys vying for your attention. Of course I got it again eventually, but you'd already had what you wanted from me and it didn’t last long. After all of that you've had the balls to come back around multiple times in the last year to try to convince me that ""I've always cared."" and that ""I still love you and I want to give you another chance."" Me? Another chance? Yeah, because I'm the one who took advantage of complete, naive

&gt;First and foremost, but 3 years later, there are somethings that I need to say. 

&gt;It’s hard losing your best friend. I have to admit, people, a t-shirt, a photo, a song, a movie, they all remind me of things that happened. I can’t listen to “Linger, not to mention the two hour subway and bus ride out there and getting lost on the campus.

&gt;Or it’s a t-shirt. Like the Salute Your Shorts Camp Anawanna shirt you got me for my birthday. You gave it to me standing outside your dorm after we had dinner. You left me early that night because you had work you needed to do.

&gt;It’s a movie. It’s “Nightmare Before Christmas.” We went to see it on Halloween. It was a late show and we got out after the subway had shut down, I SHOT MARVIN IN THE FACE!) that became an inside running joke for us. Or it’s Wall-e, which I still can’t watch without getting emotional and upset. 

&gt;There are other things that don’t even need a trigger. Things like meeting your brother in Chinatown

&gt;A. holds a lot of memories. Eating at that Irish pub on K. St, I gave you my coat, boasting that I had been a scout and scouts don’t get cold. 

&gt;There are not so good memories though. The awkward Jimmy Eat World concert comes to mind. Or that disastrous first date we had on your birthday. I’m surprised now that you still eventually wanted to be friends with me after that. I completely admit I don’t remember what movie we saw

&gt;After that, I got detripled. You let me cry like a girl, which in retrospect, I did a lot while you knew me. Then you helped me move. Reflecting on our relationship, now I feel like that was one of the defining moments of our relationship. Really, there were four, that being the first. 

&gt;The second was Valentines day. We weren’t dating yet. I had just gotten the bad news about an old girlfriend that I still cared about. She had just been diagnosed with cancer. It was late, told me I would be okay and then kissed me on the cheek. That’s when I thought you felt the same way about me as I about you.

&gt;The third was the first kiss. It was just over a week later. on the 22nd. of February. We had been watching

&gt;The fourth I’m guessing you know. The break up. You know what happened up to that point. It was drizzling. After you left me standing in nearly the same spot as our first kiss I call my mother and then my friend. We went down to the Earth Day concert in an effort to cheer me up. It rain on me

&gt;In thinking about these times, the paranoia all spread from this unrealized need I had. I caused the break up, no denying that. But if it’s any consolation, I’m no longer that person, in large part because of you. Though not completely secure, I no longer have anxiety attacks; I no longer worry or wonder.

&gt;But there are questions that remain and maybe that’s why all of all the girls I’ve dated, but I’d be lying if I told you I was over you. And because of that, questions remain. 

&gt;Question that frankly

&gt;I don’t know you anymore. People change a lot over the span of 3 years. I’m no longer the clingy boyfriend. I’m no longer the mediocre achiever in school. It may take me 5 years to graduate, but it’s my past now. I’m now in a happy relationship with a girl I love very much. A girl I see a future with. So I’m trying to move on.

&gt;The what-if’s remain though. What if I had been a little different, but it’s difficult.

&gt;I’ve lost many friends over the years. Some important

I've been dismissed and ignored and actively disregarded by so many people in my life up until this point and it still shocks me that you notice. That you care.

You saved my life over the summer. I was going to go home from school and hang myself, you didn't have ulterior motives. You just wanted to talk. And that's exactly what I needed. I didn't even want a relationship at first - I was still pretty sure I was going to kill myself. But there was something about you that kept me going. You were funny and you were engaging and you understood my little quirks and shared your own. I remember nights over the summer where I'd get home from work and I would be upset and poised to hurt myself. I'd sit at my desk and wonder if it was a scissors or knife night when I'd look up to a message from you. And I'd respond absently but hours later I'd find I'd completely forgotten about hurting myself. And I began looking forward to every time we got to speak.

You saved my life last night. I don't know what came over me and how a little worry turned into genuine suicidal thoughts, and so was I. But you didn't let go. You held me all night even though you weren't supposed to be there. I felt safe with you. I always feel safe with you.

1321115505.0,m9uqn,To the man who I used to call Dad.,fitfulsleeper21,12,1,3,"Dear Dad

You weren’t my biological father, and it was a hard time for all of us. She said a lot of bad things about you and I suddenly became the messenger between you two. You sunk deeper into drinking, and when I visited you I just felt awkward and stuck in the middle of the mess.

But, so I didn’t see you much and that gave us space to deal with all going on. I visited occasionally, called sometimes to check-up. But I was always the one calling to check-in, you never called me first unless it was for me to tell something to mom or get something of yours that you left at the house.  I talked to my stepsisters (your daughters) and they said you were pulling away from them too, so I tried not to take it too personally that you were growing distant. As months of little contact went by I told myself it was because you were going through a rough time. And you were, I still know that.

The first big effect was that you stopped coming to my soccer games. You were always my biggest fan and I missed your presence. But

I don’t remember which order these next events came in exactly

I remember going to thanksgiving that year and feeling oddly out of place with my now ex step-family. I remember that Christmas, and I was so happy to have been included. But then I realized you given me the bag that had been intended for  the sister who wasn’t there. You hadn’t remembered me after all. While you played cards I spent the next hour in the corner eating alone with my ex and making small talk with the other relatives before I made an excuse to leave, and I had wished you realized how awkward it felt for me to be there since the break-up.

When I had a lead in the musical, my ex bf’s parents came, my bosses came. But you didn’t. I cried in the bathroom, feeling so stupid and like it was a scene straight out of some clichéd lifetime movie.

Another Christmas came around. You hadn’t called and invited me to the usual family-get together for Christmas so I figured you must not be doing anything. Mom had to work so I was driving to my ex’s house  when I decided to call you, and I cried again. You hadn’t invited me.

On my birthday in January

Nothing. At this point I was angry, and I wanted you to try for me. I knew you weren’t the type of guy who was open with emotions or anything, but I felt like our relationship was barely there anymore and you didn't seem to give two shits. 

I began to doubt myself, and that if you wanted to keep a relationship with me then you damn well better call me.

You never did

I think the last time I spoke to you was when you showed up at my high school graduation. We have a picture together

3 years have gone by since then without another word between us. Your daughters and your sisters still call me occasionally and talk to me on fb, did you love me anymore? Was I now a completely fatherless girl?

I am not good with these types of things and you were always such a stoic man who didn’t talk about his feelings

But I couldn’t. I was still waiting for you to be the adult and to take care of me and reassure me and all those things adults are supposed to do. That fathers are supposed to do.

You added me on fb a year ago and I never said a word to you, asking all those questions that bother me, if you want to be my dad or not, asking if you even care about me anymore, if you want to reopen a relationship.

But I’m too scared to hit send. I'm too scared to ask. I'm a coward and even when I think I am a mature adult

I found out a few months ago that you have a new baby boy. Other than being kind of grossed out that someone would still sleep with your old fat butt

I told myself that I gave you up a long time ago, how you would be the only one to come to my games since mom worked all the time. I think about watching the movie ‘Santa Claus’ with you every Christmas and going to the movies on Sunday afternoons, just me and you, and that your favorite movies were the Back to the Future series. I think about how I could get whatever I wanted out of you because I was the baby. Your only defense was telling me to go ask mom, because we both knew that whatever I asked, you would probably give-in. I think about the distinct smell of your work-clothes and the way you would fart loudly in front of my friends without a care in the world. I got all my worst humor from you.
 
I told myself that I don't need you in my life and I've been fine without you

I’m not who I was when I was 15 and I don’t think you are who you were when I was a kid, 3 years since we've even seen each other, but it seems like a lifetime has passed and I don’t know you anymore. I see myself walking down the aisle alone when I get married, and it hurts so much to have lost 2 fathers in my life.

I know I should toughen up and contact you already before I live to regret it like I did with my real dad, that too much time has passed and that our lives are too separate now. And anyway, I don’t think about you much anymore, so I'm fine right? 

But when I do think about you

Yes

But you saw through the vitriol

[This year won't end well if I keep finding people who want to break me open.]

That's what you did, and just a little bit of coyness; both of us know that up until now I haven't been lucky enough to experience these things. And then you, the shy one, kicked down even more unseen barriers. So we started to scrap together some sort of mutual affection out of dust and lint and whatever we could scatch together and built some makeshift companionship fueled only by the occasional textual discourse. But I treasured this kicked-together jumble of emotions, I treasured it like it was my life-savings. I don't know if you realized that it was important to me, or if you fully comprehend how signifigant this is.

Why did you leave me? Would it not have been better to talk this out as I had suggested? Instead you leave me with barely three lines of excuse. I still can't place my finger on what attracted me to you. Objectively

I loved that small coal that kicked into my body when I slowly realized you liked me back. No, though. I don't want to give up this precious sliver of BEING that you'd gifted to me. I don't want to be numb again, and it was my mistake for claiming that that route would be better. 

I just want to talk to you! I just want to talk to someone! I deserve this as much as any of the other 7 billion fuckers on this planet. I know you have your life and your friends and your school and your job but I don't have any of these

But what can I do? You have cut me off completely.

I guess I'll just wait for you to come back.

We learned a lot from each other and spilled our souls to each other and we were best friends. The problems started when you wanted to be my only friend. You were the loner who was too cool for school and I was still the insecure girl whose default setting was to doubt everything. I've seen the rougher sides of a lot of peoples' personalities


There's one vivid memory I love returning to now and then. It was summer vacation and my mom had just left for work. I of course was sleeping in, gave it all a dream-like quality. The obvious happened, but afterward when I was trying to keep that moment magical forever, you just stared at me with this look and told me I was beautiful, and that's the first time I believed it, ever. I have plenty of memories, though.


I'd probably start crying if I ever were to tell you this to your face. I'm trying not to tear up as I write this but I've had a few years to come to grips with everything. I love the feeling I had then, the joy. You. You did something to me that no one else has ever been able to do. I don't know what it is, but even after every dick move and flippant comment and the just plain immature behavior, it hasn't sullied the rest.


I don't really let myself think about you. You come to mind in one way or another at least every day I'd say, just as I remember how you hoarded all of mine. I threw mine out when my guy at the time was showing insecurity over them. You told me on one of the rare occassions we talked that you had thrown yours out also. I didn't want to believe it, because as logical as I am, it feels good to feed the starving longing sometimes. I do think you threw them out though, as you aren't really one to hang onto things once they're.. no longer options.


I still go to the park where I feel like I can still feel you the most, light a cig, recline my seat, turn off the radio, and think. Any time I'm feeling overly stressed out or out of sync, I'll just park there in that spot and contemplate shit. I think being there has less to do with you specifically, and more to do with how carefree and innocent I was then


You opened my eyes to a lot of things. The fact that we ended badly doesn't take away from all you gave me, and I swear I wish I could knit a sweater out of the feelings you gave me, and never take it off. But, like with all things when growing up, shit happens. You couldn't handle what happened to us, and there's no way I wouldn't have handled it.


I think we're the kind of people who are always going to be drawn toward each other, but that's it. We both still live in the never-changing town we fell in love in, but in never seeing one another, that fact seems almost surreal. But the bench where you made me your girlfriend is still there. The stop sign on the corner where you told me you loved me for the first time still stands. And all the memories of our sweet, sweet love, are forever in my heart.

The one from my first letter was my best friend friend in elementary school

But for the 3 years of senior high

---------------------------
Hi

Let me explain the situation

We used to hung out in High School. I was in 5th year of school [In Québec

I was 16, but it didn't bother me because you were a lot more mature than even the senior girls.

I made you laugh

Her smile and discrete looks in my direction with wide eyes fueled my imagination.

About a week before my 17th birthday

You almost cried

But, you couldn't dump him only a few minutes after agreeing to go out with him. 

You told me: ""As soon as we are done

I was confused

To this day (yes

He had his eyes on you for a while and simply wanted to know if he had a chance before I asked you out. He didn't really plan for you to say ""yes"" because he was convinced you wanted to go out with me.

In fact

You would have been my first girlfriend. You were his first girlfriend. A nerd never dumps his first girlfriend so you too dated until after graduation.

And so

But, the idea that you would say yes to me if I ever found you stayed, fueling my imagination.

Every girl I met in college would be compared to you for a little while until I forgot your smile

I got myself a girlfriend and your name even left me

Then oddly

Except I was now 18. The images I had in my mind were that of a 15 year old girl.

Did that make me a pedophile for wanting a 15 year old girl? Never mind that you were now 17

When I was 19

I married her. We had a daughter together. We are happy.

But from time to time

I long to caress your 15 year old body and I worry once again that I am a pedophile in one way or another.

But then

And I realize that it's not the 20 or 30 something me that wants you. It's the 17 year old me

My wife says that perhaps you didn't want to hurt me that day. Maybe you never wanted to really date me.

I believe her

**And then

I didn't call right away. It took almost 1 month to admit to my wife I had found your phone number because the 30 something year old in me see no interest in calling you.

It's the 17 year old who wants answers.

And then  it took me another two months to actually call. What would I say? What would I ask?

You answered. You voice didn't echo anything in my mind. I couldn't recognize it. Perhaps age changed it or perhaps my memories are twisted.

Still

You remember high school.

But you have no idea of who I am. Zero. My name doesn't ring a bell. You have no recollection of who I am.

That day

I never forgot any girl I ever had desire for. I may have forgotten a last name here or perhaps have the wrong first name

I miss you. I won't admit it to anyone and I'll deny it when asked, SMACK, right in the chest. I get all choked up as everything comes rushing back, the love, the passion, the fear and the hurt. 

You came over and I could see it in your body language, I don't want you anymore. When you finally met my eyes, I said one word: Bullshit. And I saw it, a crack in your armor. When you left, we hugged, and that's when your walls came crashing down. You did not let go of me for two hours as we sat there and cried. If that's not love, then I don't know what is.  

You used to say “I was made for you.” How I came into your life and changed what you thought you knew about life. It's true. I *made* you realize that you are capable of love and being loved. You are WORTH loving. I saw you for who you are, no it terrifies you.

I got through all your walls without you even noticing. When you realized how intimate our relationship had become, now. It saddens me to see your insecurities take over your life, and how unlovable you think you are. But I can't take down your walls at the same rate you put them up. 

The last thing you said to me was “trust yourself.” The thing is, so I gave it to you. But if I trust myself, I just know that you care, and one day you'll come back. But I also know it will take years for you to face this. So I'll admit it, part of my heart was waiting for you. How much longer will it wait? Not much. The battle between the immense hope I see in you and the hurt that weighs down my heart is becoming too hard for me to bear.

So
I can’t love you

I brought you here to show you a little about myself and tell you things you may have not known. I feel it’s only fair since I know much more about you than you know about me. 

This is the Charles River and that is my building. When I get stressed at work or when I get fed up with things I just look out that window over there

I don’t have to tell you my life story; I don’t have to tell you anything but somehow my gut tells me that this is the logical next step. Both of us are bottled up with emotions and have big issues with expressing them. I want to change that. What you told me Sunday night was empirical. Humans in general think emotionally and while language seems to be a great barrier in expressing them it’s a means to a solution. 

In elementary school I was the “teacher’s pet” I was not too popular in class but was loved by my teachers. In middle school everything went to hell, I started making friends; I started finding who I was. Suddenly, second semester I ended up in the hospital and at one point I was told that my situation was worsening. At that point all I wanted was for the doctors to leave me alone. Why work on someone that is hopeless… I told them and my parents to just let me die. I didn’t know better. For 2 years I lived in misery and depression. I kept telling myself my best friend was “Johnnie, Johnnie Walker.” I was lost. I knew I wanted things in life but could not find the means to achieve them. It wasn’t really until Doug pushed me into moving into this apartment that things started finally falling into place. I knew Doug and had met Carol but I didn’t know my 3rd roommate…hahaha The first night I spent in this apartment was interesting because for once I noticed a highly motivated, smart, and beautiful young woman. For some reason she felt safe with me, secure enough to tell me her biggest fears and her greatest desires. For some reason we were put together and somehow had this strong connection between us. I secretly had a crush on this person for a long time. Heck when I got back from India and she fell asleep next to me, I know some chemistry exists between the two of us but it can get so frustrating when you lose all hope. For most people I guess they would move on but for me I tried harder because I wanted something

It’s hard to believe that could have changed, and I’ve sometimes wondered if I were to go back and see the rest of your family again, would the grieving come then?

I truly value our friendship and I love spending time with you. I would put aside most things just to eek out a few minutes or hours to sit and chat with you. You make me feel fantastic. I know that our friendship has limits because of our spouses

You ask me to be honest with you and act surprised/irritated when things are going on in my life that I didn’t tell you about but I find it hard to transfer information when we talk only a few hours a week. A lot goes on in our lives and you spend most of the time that we talk discussing your life

I don't call, believe me I do, it's just that I don't want to cause trouble for you and I fear losing our friendship all together. I can't tell you about this because then you would know how I feel about your spouse and their issues and that puts you in a weird place too. 

Also things have been different, which I really don’t do with anyone ever and you broke my trust. I have never had a friend that I could talk to and tell everything too, my spouse included. Even though I love them I try to shield them and not overload them with my shit. When we reconnected I was more honest with you than I’ve been with anyone ever but since you broke my trust I’ve lost that and it hurts so much. I desperately seek a friend who I can be open and honest with and who genuinely cares about me and what I have to say. I thought I had that with you, but I don’t. It’s unfair to blame you or put that on you but part of me mournes what I thought could have been.

I probably have no right to say this, and I'm pretty confident in those guesses.

I believed you when you said you were taking a break from dating, that I was psyched enough with that. 

When we found out that we both are into kink, and it was so exciting. Our communication was stellar, we were careful of boundaries, and I was just loving the journey. I got so scared when you said we'd have to stop in the fall so you could focus on school. I've become amazing at protecting myself from emotional pain, so I told you I understood, but we should stop right then, because it would be harder to end the longer it went on. I know I did this because I was scared

Is it just me, but I've definitely taken the initiative here.

And now tonight, but whatever happened to taking a year off dating?? It's not like you met her and were so excited about the chemistry or whatever. You met her on a dating site. Why are you on a dating site if you were taking a year off dating? You don't owe it to me to keep me updated on everything going on in your life, but UGH. That's frustrating.

I miss you, but the rain is lovely and you can see it out the windows. And the bride is real nice. They overpaid me for today. I played what I wrote that night we talked, and I told you about that song and told her it was a love song because it sounded so sweet. 

It made them happy. 

Everyone keeps asking about the pretty cellist in the corner with the bright smile. Got another gig out of this.

I thought that might make you happy. Knowing I am safe

I spent a good majrority of my summer break texting and skyping with you, they did. Or, I thought they did. I asked if you'd like to go out, try this whole LDR thing with me, using a cute little drawing and flowers. You asked me if I was serious and never gave me a response. Sure, that's fair if you think about it. 

Fast forward a month, and I settled on skyping you. While you ate and spent time with your friend. Not to mention the fact I waited two hours for you to get online, only to skype for 45 minutes.

Whatever

Then, you text me and apologize. The weekend before your birthday. Convenient time to apologize. Then, you leave me with one word responses and more empty promises. And here we are today. 

I'm left wondering if I bother trying anymore

I love you. So so much. And I miss you just as much. I'm incredibly grateful I had 13 months with you and I'll never forget what that was like. I want you to know that the last time I saw you, but I'm sure you've seen him from wherever you are. He reminded me so much of you when he was the same age. It hurt, but he helped me more then he will ever know. 

I also want you to know that what happened to you wasn't fair and I'm so, you deserved to have a full life. The person that was responsible for you leaving too early is paying for what he's done and I know it still doesn't make up for it, but it's something. :( 

I know you watch over us, and other days I'm so alone and scared. My life will never be the same. It's affected every part of me. And sometimes to think about you, even for a second, hurts my heart more then anything ever could. I feel like my heart has been physically broken sometimes. I feel like there's a chunk of it missing, a piece of it I'll never get back. It hurts. I'm sorry if you ever see that, but it really has changed everything. Even the way I think. I trusted and at one point loved someone, and look what they did. They took something from me, that we can never get back.  I don't even know how to trust my own judgement at times now, that I once held you in my arms. I put you on a potty. I fed you with your tiny little spoons. I bought you pretty little hats. I grew you inside of me for 9 months. I can't wish that never happened. 

Everything reminds me of you. Movies, innocent comments, your new little cousin. 

I try not to blame myself. In the back of my mind I have a million 'what ifs' that I fear will never go away. What if I ran away with the two of you

Your birthday is in a couple months. 4 years old soon! You'd be such a beautiful little girl now. I bet your hair would be so pretty and long now. You'd definitely have better hair then your big brother. :) 

I want you here with me so badly. I'll never understand why it happened. I'll never understand why I don't have a beautiful daughter right now. I love you.  

Please never stop watching over us Baby La. I need you here with me. With us. 

I love you.

I didn't know you were with me until I was 4 1/2 months pregnant. I drank almost every weekend and smoked weed. Hurting that innocent brain and body of yours. When I saw you in the ultrasound

As I was going into labor, I had to thank God for giving you mercy for your stupid mother's mistakes. 

Breastfeeding you is the best I can offer yet

Now as we go into our lives together, I am doing my absolute best, but what if that's not enough? What if I can't give you the best opportunities that are out there? And what if you could be better off with a couple who is married.. God, I can't. I can't give you up. I won't. I just wish I was in a better situation for you. I wish you didn't have to come into this part of my life where I am still depending on my medicated/ bipolar mother. We're leaving soon, to your daddy's house.

A girl, holding him and believing him. ""Will you promise to be my boyfriend forever?"" ""No, I can't..."" ""Why not?"" ""Ring things. But I can promise that I'll love you forever.""

Later, alone, loved by many people but not the one she wanted to spend her life with. A girl, wanting to die and thinking of the one person she gave her all to. A girl, writing this and knowing you could find it if you wanted to. You don't want to. You don't care anymore.

A girl, but my logic won't triumph over my emotions. I know that you're wrong for me, that we will never have a future together, and that it is better off this way but my heart says ""Come back to me, please. At least say my name. At least give me a few words."" 

Listening to fireworks and remembering how kissing you didn't give me fireworks like in those dramas, our kisses were messy, sometimes I felt like shit even when you were around, sometimes I doubted my love for you, you even annoyed me at times, but I still loved you. I still do love you. Maybe not in a desperate way anymore, but I will always have this place in my heart for you.

It's been really tense all month, and sometimes, you're cranky because of your jobs or just life in general and I feel like a horrible person because it seems like many of the things I do annoy you. I think I was a very different person when we met; more into the little things that make life happy, more outgoing and excited for life. My plans for the future have reduced greatly since then if I were to look at it from old me's point of view. Maybe that's why we're not in love anymore. And with the complications we'll be going through in the next year, I don't feel like hanging onto you is worth it.

Edit: Hi. Maybe I should be asleep. But I've got lots of things in my mind now. 

My self confidence has gone down lower than it's been for a while. I haven't felt this bad about myself since fifteen moths ago when I was pretty much losing my mind over everything. I don't have a single close friend other than you and the girl from my dorm that is many hours away right now. I think I care for lots of people, but you're the same as me right now; closed and sarcastic and refusing to show much emotion. 

If I could I would give you all the time and money you need to be able to travel around while writing your first novel, but you are sure you aren't. 

Is it possible to love someone to bits and still dislike being near them? You, even my coworkers to extent, you're all wonderful beautiful people but you all make me so stressed and upset and angry.

If I were able to, we'd be cordial, of course, and we'd pretend we wanted to catch up. We'd make plans and never follow through, we'd make half-hearted promises, we'd forget each other. And that would be okay. Except I don't think I can't do that. I can't bring myself to abandon you because you don't want to be in a relationship. I know you need someone. Maybe I'm just being pretentious and self-absorbed, maybe I have an overblown sense of my ability to help others

If we were in a movie, you would notice that I am beautiful; every time I listened and helped you would remember why you think I'm such a good person. We would be inseparable, those two people who are ""just friends"" but everyone knows are really more than that. Eventually you'd tell me you were wrong to reject me, that you just weren't ready, that you cared for me and you always had and always would. I would love that. Except we're not in a movie. And I respect that you're not interested, and that you have the right to reject me. I'm beginning to see that I'm wonderful, but even with that I know I may not be what you need or just what you want.

In real life, and it will get better. I'll be there for you on those days when you hurt for no reason and try to stop hating yourself, and you'll keep me on the ground when I want to fly away. One of these days, I'll be over my feelings for you. Eventually I'll fall for other boys and hopefully you'll heal enough to fall for other girls. It'll break my heart a little, again, the first girl I see you dating. I don't know how you'll feel if I get a boyfriend. Maybe I'll always want you to be a little jealous. Maybe I'll always want you to realize we should be together.

Regardless, I can't force myself to throw away your friendship just because I developed feelings and you don't reciprocate them. So we'll be friends. Just friends, not ""just friends."" And we're gonna be okay. Okay?

I do not regret my decision. I know she only wants my happiness and I intend to give her that wish. I'm starting a webcomic and working on illustration in general. So I guess that's it for now. I just wanted to update you on my life. And tell you that a lot of this was because I thought back to the lessons you taught me through the years I had the privilege of taking your class.

I guess that I'm writing this for some closure and to format my thoughts before I talk to you. I need to get it out of my mind and onto some form of writing so I can actually be coordinated when I try and talk to you about everything that's happened. 

I haven't had any close friends before I met you, I have people that I care about and people who I can trust. However, you were and still are my closest friend, even if you're currently drifting away from me. 

I didn't stay friends with you because I had feelings for you like many people thought. In fact I considered us as simply friends for a while. However I found that as we spent more time together, days, even weeks in your presence I found that I did have feelings for you. I found that you had taken a knife with your name on it and stabbed me in the heart with it. Everytime I saw you, that knife would push in a little deeper. Every time I heard your laugh, listened to your voice, or recognized your smile, the knife would twist sharply into my heart. 

I never told you about this though. I didn't want to ruin our friendship. I observed as suitor after lovestruck suitor was turned away with a smile and a quick no. I didn't want you to push me away like that

It was around this time that one of your suitors actually managed to make you feel something. When you told me, I picked up all my feelings and tried to keep calm. Your new beau made me realize that I could never make you feel that way, and that I could never be with you like you wanted to be with him. 

You told me that you were ""Happier than you ever felt in a long time"" and that he ""made your heart race and your face flush."" Every word that you said was a stab into my heart. Every breathless sigh you exhaled made me wither on the inside. I couldn't respond properly to whatever you said during that time so I merely listened and let your voice wrap around me. I found some small comfort in that. 

You noticed that I was upset, so I was harsher than I should have been to you. You asked me what was wrong, asked if the situation between you and him was upsetting me. That sentence rushed over me and made me feel alive again, to know that you cared about me made me feel better than any drug could ever made me feel. 

Then you told me that I could talk to you about it, why I fell in love with you, why I stayed up waiting for you to text back. 

I don't know where I go from here though, if it also requires me to go away and merely watch you from a distance then I will even if it splits me inside. I only ever want you to be happy.

This week is the last week i'll talk to you for a long time. I'm going to prom with you and then its over. I know you love still being friends with me but its getting too hard for me.

Something has changed with you. The girl I knew just a year ago was happy and energetic and willing to do new and exciting things. You weren't afraid to wear what you wanted and what was comfortable. You wanted to go places and explore you were excited about going away to college. 

A year later everything has changed. You are now obsessed about modesty. When I saw you yesterday you didn't look comfortable in 85 degree weather wearing a two dark shirts and a black skirt and leggings. You no longer wear comfortable clothing because you are afraid it isn't modest and that you are sinning because its your fault that wearing shorts and pants make a man have lustful thoughts about you?

When you kissed me goodbye in August I fell asleep. That’s the last moment I remember. I remember the look of love on your face, the tears, and the reassurance that we’d be fine. I remember each beautiful strand of blue in your amazing eyes, the warmth and comfort found in your arms, and your calming sent. Your voice that awakened something so deep in me I never knew existed. The fear of losing you was like a dull ache, but the fear of losing myself was what drove me mad. 

Somehow I fell asleep and wouldn’t wake up for another seven months. 

I remember waking up. It was literally a deep breath of fresh air. My head was cloudy and confused. I remember smiling and my body letting out a sigh of relief. All the tense discomfort of seven months seemed to fade in one moment and I couldn’t help but laugh. I felt like myself again. 

I was allowed to go home and I started living again. I gained back all the weight I lost, I was finally myself again. I was alive.

Then the memories came back. I reread text messages in horror; replayed events in my mind feeling appalled. Surely this person from these memories does not exist… Surely I’ve never known her.

In anguish, immaturity, insecurities, intense emotions: none of these are excuses. 

I had my reasons at the time

I’m sorry for changing on you. I’m sorry for taking all of my pain and frustration out on you. I’m sorry I didn’t trust you. Above all

I know you’ve said before that I don’t need to apologize

My pain and regrets aside

Four months later and you’re still on my mind every day. I still want you more than anything and still love you more than life itself. 

I wish I could talk to you. I wish I could feel your warm embrace and see that happy light in your eyes. But I blew it and it’s too late now. I know that.

I want you to know that I’m better now and I want you to be happy in every way, so if you’re fine without me I’ll disappear. 

I meant it when I said I’ll always love you. The intensity will fade over time

You were my best friend for years. I hated you so much sometimes, and all the shame you made me feel.

I put up with the fact that, we were *both* labelled the smelly kids even though I was perfectly fine and you were the one that had no bladder control. I put up with that, because I loved you. You were my best friend. 

You made me walk through a graveyard in the middle of the night on my own, and they shouted at me. I put up with that, because I loved you. You were my best friend. 

When you made us walk across that flooded river when we were 13 and told your grandparents I'd forced you to do it

I remember when your grandmother, I was so embarrassed and ashamed, and I really hated you then. 

Your mother died of cancer when you were 5. That is, just because you knew you could get it and I couldn't. I remember when I wanted a parrot, so your grandparents bought you a parrot. I remember when I wanted to buy a beautiful gothic dress but couldn't afford it, you stole your dad's money and bought it for yourself. Why the fuck did I forgive you for that?

You slowly drifted apart from me. You started spending time with pretty, but not me. My heart broke that day. The bitch I put up with for all those years didn't need me anymore. I cried so much. I never knew a friend could break my heart. 

I've heard so much about you over the past 6 years

You walked past me in the street one day when I was 18 and we had a brief hello. I cried all night. 

Well, so you got your mother's inheritance. Your mother who died of cancer when you were 5. You got £82,000. If I had that amount of money I would pay off my student loans and take my sister to America. We've dreamed about going to Arizona for years. But you absolute scum piece of shit spent it on ""perfume, drugs and clothing"". You, Sarah, are a cunt stain.

Anyone can work like a robot, hard and long.  Anyone can study and push themselves to accomplish.  But, friendships and inter-personal stuff like that... That requires a special sort of circumnavigation.  And you lack the compass.

I ask myself: Why? Why should I hang around and wait on the hope that you'll realize you're being a little hard?  That maybe, in my restlessness?

I used to love, and the welcoming tone in your greeting.  That one, and last, day we had together, last year, with the errands and the movie... Our longest day together, and I wished it wouldn't end.  Because, I had to move.

So what if we're friends, and I will prove that I can still be that, even when you're at your worst.  Because, you beautiful dolt, I won't ever abandon you.

I'm crazy. You're mostly sane. But do not, no matter what I did, you would keep your heart beating. Tell your own shadows to fuck off, or better yet, send them to me. That's better for you.

Although our relationship only lasted eight months, feels like centuries. I thought I could do it without you, but I'm stuck spending my time doing nothing but thinking of you anyway knowing you're not thinking of me for even a second. When I broke it off, I told you I was unhappy, but really I was just making you unhappy and I couldn't take it anymore. I was so cruel to you and it was only after you weren't mine anymore had I realized why. I never told you about the problems I was having with my father.. I just didn't want to bother you... but I ended up taking all the anger I had towards him and directing it towards you. I just couldn't stop myself from being mean, and for that I'm sorry. We separated without closure and still you act like you're completely fine while I'm stuck here living in  the Hell I've made for myself.

I still sometimes wish and fantasize about how things would have been if you didn't end it

But maybe a break from relationships is really what I need, then you ended it, without reason


You left me madly in love with you and cut off all contact from me for that summer - A close friend died a week later

Maybe I needed cutting off, just so's I could get a reaction or something out of you

I really didn't see it


after 6 months of us being not ""together"" you started seeing another guy we lived with. that was unfair. I am convinced that I did not deserve that

It got you completely out of my life


I saw you the other week. Actually I've seen you a couple of times in the last 6 months, I'm on to bigger things, and I wish you well - but thats never going to happen

Well, guess what. You aren't. *None of us are.* It kills me every single day to see you throw your money away on tobacco, when you could be paying the fucking medical bills that it's causing in the first place. Hell, maybe you don't care if it's hurting me... But if that's the case I need you to tell me because I can't keep living like this. I don't need this.

You've had these cigarettes for 43 years. 43 god damn long years. I'm 16. Why can't you give me that? Why don't you want me to have a childhood? It's disgustingly unfair to punish *us* for what *your* father did to you.. It's a wonder that I ever questioned why Mom left you. 


So here it is. I want you to quit the cigarettes. Either that or I quit talking to you. You've poisoned me, because I love you more than anything. I just want you to get better. I just want to get better.

The work you yourself produced was admired by both the other old hands and the new blood, giving us insight into how things had worked back in the days of the old masters.

When I came to know you, but I still admired the way everyone respected you. I admired the way you developed characters, setting, the way you depicted things; I felt in you I knew a kindred spirit who understood the joy of building in your head a whole world, and showing people a view into a small part of it, to glimpse briefly the majesty of this universe concocted, all in your own head.

I'm not going to pretend I didn't do and say some very stupid things (though they were never to make fun of and belittle people, to develop to a point where I felt I had your skills, to command the same reverence you did and to make beautiful things just as you did.

I overlooked the fact that you were a failure in pretty much every other aspect of your life, and that you were completely incompetent with women -- well, actually, more accurately that you were a *complete fucking loser* with women. I didn't care about any of that; I still wanted to be like you. I wanted the back catalogue of work that was far and away the best of anything our colleagues had produced. I wanted the respect that came with that.

More than anything, and you never did.

And I don't know why I fucking cared, you're mean, you're vulgar, you don't have any compassion, and for some reason it has taken me ten years to realise it.

So, and I hope you feel one day deep within your gut a sudden wrenching despair when you realise people actually used to admire you and you treated them like shit. I hope one day you're miserable, and I hope I get wind of it somehow so I can laugh long and hard at you.

When you die, just to reassure myself that you're dead and that the world has thereby become a perceptibly better place. I hope, I hope so much I outlive you so that I can have this peace.

Dear Blank

I am responding to your letter, I try not to look back; I feel this is best for everyone involved.  It is now so much later, though, that I can finally reflect much more rationally and maybe help give you some information that will give you closure with respect to the past.  I'll try to respond to your original letter as it was written back then while still filling in the rest of the story.  I apologize if this response is a bit graphic, but I have read and agree with much of Dr. Brad Blanton's philosophy of being ""radically honest;"" the good doctor supports telling the truth in great explicit detail.  I'm sorry if that adds to the hurt (and maybe the grossness for Redditors), but it should also add to the clarity.  You shall learn about not just the end, but the entire path -- anything that was hidden or covert or withheld.  It will likely be painful, and the truth shall set us all free.

You say you don't know how we got to this point?  Well, really.  It is mine in the sense that I am responsible for my own life.  It is mine in the sense also that I am always trying to please people -- never trying to hurt.  I'm not trying to sugarcoat that, for it is a horrible trait that leads to dishonesty and obfuscation at the minimum.  It is yours in ways that are for you to conceive of and think about on your time, though I shall briefly mention some in the course of telling this story to give you perspective on my own thoughts and ideas at the time.  But know that I am not writing here for the sake of blaming you.

I knew very early on in our relationship that things were not meant to go the way they were going, we moved in together and you brought your daughter to live with us, and -- despite E. being a great kid -- you knew I never wanted kids -- ever.  I tried to accept the fact that if I had to be with the one I loved, I would have to be a little understanding and make that concession.  However, you just made it a huge hassle rather than easier.  Rather than pay attention to your child and maybe stop getting high for a day, you would just yell and scream at her for, in my opinion, you made no effort to keep a tidy house and you had already gotten fired from your job with no intention of finding a new one.  My fault in all this: (1) I was not forceful enough in spelling out to you what I wanted -- I could have and should have said what that was the first time you did something I didn't like; (2) I did not push you to go to work -- in fact

My dad passed away and you went on vacation after the funeral.  I know you already had everything booked and I pushed you to go.  I just felt I had a better grip on things if I had alone time, so I think that just showed that we didn't belong together.  Furthermore, how could you possibly go?  I put myself in your position, and there is absolutely no way I would go anywhere, no matter what you said or wanted, if that were to have happened to you.  Just something I've thought about post-mortem (NPI).

We then bought that big house; I don't quite know why you allowed me to buy such a thing.  I couldn't afford both houses at the same time, I fell behind on my taxes and credit cards.  I did everything to keep the image up that everything was okay, just to keep you happy.  This is my fault; I deeply feel that you would have tried to help me if I communicated the problems I was having, but I just felt like I was supposed to hold it all together somehow, no matter what.  Nevertheless, when I had to cut back on wastes of money like having the house cleaned, you did very little to take up the slack; hell, and I never felt that you did enough.  

Everything just pointed to the fact that from the time we moved there onward was a mistake.  Not long after we lived there, I never actually thought this would happen.  We were drinking outside one night after work and then we started making out.  I wouldn't dare get caught by other people at work, so I quickly gave her my keys and told her to wait in the back seat of my car.  By the time I got there, she already had her pants off.  We drove to a nearby spot and I fucked her as hard as I could.  I must have been overcome with drunkenness and lust for fulfilling my fantasy, because I gave it to her raw, no condom.  Her pussy was not that tight, and she really needed to be fucked hard to cum.  This was the first time I gave it to anyone other than you raw, I had a bit of remorse toward her for having sex while she was drunk (just kind of a thing I have), but that was unrelated.

Another girl I started talking to was B.  B. had just started at work and was pretty hot by most guys' standards; I wasn't overwhelmed, she kept jokingly inviting me over to her apartment in the city to view her closet so she could prove how she had won, and so one night I was free and I actually took a ride over just for laughs.  Things started out innocently enough; she finished getting dressed, while I watched some TV.  We sat on the sofa and had chatted for a bit, and then she showed me her closet.  Somehow, we eventually started making out.  I went down on her and made her erupt; her pussy wasn't the most delicious, but it was cute and she came hard.  She then took my cock out and started blowing me.  She was really good, she informed me that she wouldn't swallow, where occasionally she would jack me off while I fingered her

I felt guilt for these incidents for a long time, you found a reply that had been e-mailed to me on my PC while I slept.  I denied that I was the original poster, and it took a long time for you to believe me.  This sucks because I could have truly come clean then and there and we could have decided what to do.  I mean, let's face it -- it was time to move on anyway, so might as well go through the pain and do it.  But no, I, the ""nice guy, yes I did love you, and by that point I frequently regretted that I had not found a girl who was more to my taste physically.  I'm sorry; this is a horrible thing to have to confess considering the image I put on to keep you happy and living the dream.  This too is my fault.

The rest, I really felt at my wits end.  I didn't blame you or him (though I probably should have), but I took it as an opportunity to break us up so that I could maybe move on.  This was not fair to you, but you would not relent and allow that which ought to have happened to happen, and I didn't know what else to do in my weakened state.  I think you knew quite well that it was over.  I couldn't pay the bills anymore, and we had big troubles that had mostly come from your direction.  We just didn't belong together anymore.  I'm sorry I led you on when that was just the truth.  You had to have seen it too though, no?

We could have technically gone back to the first house to live, this charade would go on indefinitely, and so I lied and said we couldn't go due to legal problems I was having.  What a coward I was.  If I truly loved and trusted you, I should have just been honest.  And if I didn't love you, then I really should have been honest.  Either way, there is no excuse for my behavior here, and I'm sorry.  Surprisingly, it is just surprising how many other people must pull the same treacherous shit.

I had been friends with C. for a long time, I accepted.  I could have gone to the other house or somewhere else, but let's face it -- knowing my track record from all the above --, somewhere deep inside me, I think I wanted to fuck her too.  I figured if I was around her long enough, something would eventually have happened.  What was my attraction to her?  I don't really know; she is not really my type of girl *at all*.  I guess it just goes back a lot of years; lots of sexual frustration and tension gets built at our work I guess and these things just happen, especially between two people who become close.  My guess is that she too felt this same way about me

While I lived there, but that didn't really seem to happen.  It was nice going to see you those couple of times while we were apart in the hotel.  You showed up looking great.  Off came your dress and those plump drooping nipples of yours filled my mouth.  Your pussy was fresh and smooth for me, and I french kissed her for hours as she quivered while mashed against my face.  You were on top and blew me and, as I was ready to blow my load, gripped me hard by the base of my cock and drained me right into your throat.  Your pussy then expoded into my mouth with my nose in your ass.  I flipped over, and you jerked me until I got hard again and then rode me while your pendulous tits slapped together in rhythm till I came a second time and filled you up.  We went to sleep, and in the morning you would be gone to work before I even was awake.  Things seemed like old times almost.  You convinced me that we needed to get somewhere to stay fast, though, which I really felt when I grabbed her ass.  I almost came right then and there.  I quickly remembered the regret I had had from last time, for whatever that's worth.  Weird how those two things happened in one day.  Sorry

As I unpacked my belongings in the new apartment

As we got settled there, I would drive up to her apartment, and pick her up, and we would spend the afternoon together.  We were truly just friends.  We had gone to yoga together and a few other things and just had great intelligent conversations.  I even told you about her, because I felt there was really no harm in the friendship.  She always pushed me to better my life, and I her.  She always asked when we would go on a trip somewhere to hike or do something worthwhile, fun, as you well know, since we probably wouldn't get another chance to go away.  I packed my car and took off driving.  I do wish you and I had hit it one last time, we shared a hotel room

At that point, so as you started to give me a hard time while I was away, I was less and less interested in talking to you and eventually just avoided your calls.  I'm sorry about that; that is some stupid defense mechanism I have, and I kept you in the dark needlessly.

Once I came back from Z., I went and took all of my belongings while you were out and texted you later about it.  This is probably my lowest moment, because after all the time we had together, I ought to have been able to face you.  I don't know what exactly my problem was, but I kept hiding more and more within myself.

I never had been like that before, so the parts that were not easy for me as a result are understandable to me.  My childish way of dealing with all of this must have been so painful for you when it could have been so much easier.  For this, I am truly sorry; you know me, so you can understand the pain that follows me as a result of these actions.  I know E. was especially hurt, and I wish I could go back in time and handle it properly if for no one else's sake than hers.

All those great times you mention, blasting it on your face, swallowing your essence while you swallow mine -- that stuff was great.  I can't believe that after all these years, I only have two pictures of you naked, because I wish I had ten thousand just for the occasional *urge*.  All that said, the past is the past, and we do not belong together or thinking about one another.  I really wish you well.  I hope you can find the kind of guy I pretended to be, who will be loyal, I have felt every good and bad emotion for you -- hell, and yes it is long since over -- never to go back.  In the coming weeks and months as you digest this (or don't since you won't receive it)

When we were together, that we're always the most logical ones—the two highly rational ones of our close-knit group of friends. And yet when we were together, we let our emotions run us, let them take over our logical sides. So very uncharacteristic for the both of us. It was a bad idea, and we knew it. And we accepted that.

Being with you was like being in a fairytale I knew was a lie. I knew it wasn't the real world

It's not like we pretended we were different people, and then we'd gone and pretended that they were, we'd carried on like we were in this new reality where your relationship with her had never existed. Our emotions were the same, the words we said were real, we just pretended the past was a different thing. 

But when we'd left fantasy land for the night, and I remembered how real life worked, and that she had been your girlfriend and was still my best friend. I remembered how much she had loved you, still loved you. You broke up with her a while before we got together, but she still had feelings for you. If she would have found out, she would've hated you, never trusted me again

She never did find out, wore down our capricious emotions and finally regained control. 

I remember that night, and that entailed pain, and I didn't want either of us to have to go though that. So I was so relieved because the next day, we were still good friends but no longer lovers, and it felt happy but it also felt real. That night, I laughed again with relief, and then I cried because we were quitting that sweet, comforting fairy tale. 

I'm still astounded no one figured us out, we act like nothing ever happened. For them, and most importantly for her, nothing ever did. For me, though, it's such a different story--it happened, and I don't want to ever forget that

Thank you for caring so much about me. Thank you, and I couldn't have done it alone, and I don't think I've thanked you for that. So thank you. You're making me believe in my own value.

I am self-aware enough to understand that I could be clouded by a feeling that I love and hate. I've always been a masochist, you and I, we are both living, breathing beings living in this world. You're not a figment of my imagination or my fantasy for my future. You are someone that I've grown to love. You are real and so am I.

I love you... But I am 99% sure you will never know I love you. I won't dare tell you. It's too messy and I need you in my life. I leave a 1% chance of doing it because I feel that if we could meet the conditions for me to tell you

I don't need to tell you about our history. You were there for it. But you don't know the backstory

I met you almost three years ago, but I paid no heed. I let myself think right now, at this moment, if maybe if I had paid attention our story would be different. But timing... You left soon after that and didn't show up until the moment that I met you.

Whatever brought me to talk to you is not very relevant, I didn't want to see it. Between noticing and not noticing, I became interested. 

I wasn't always interested in you

I was happy talking to you, without warning, falling in love with you. I thought that everything you did was special, and not because I was blind to your faults, although I was, but because we were so alike. We would agree on everything, think the same way. I grew to know myself a little better because of you.

Then we hit our first bump. I know to you we were only friends, but in all honesty, sometimes I do.

When your significant other asked you to stop talking to me, above all, for you to be happy. But you were outraged and I know that took a toll. Even if he apologized and the waters calmed down, I know it must not have been the same. 

I am sorry for being an obstacle. Maybe looking back on it I should have walked away but I couldn't; I couldn't because you saw me as your friend but I see you as something else

You and I seem to be the a case of not getting what one wants, even though I am in love with you, I love you and care about you. Sometimes I feel you're like a sister to me; the sister I always wanted but never got. I've learned so much from you and you've made me a better person in a lot of ways, and I've only come to know this through being without you, but I'll get to that shortly.

After our impasse, we exchanged views and had fun in our little ways. I think I know you but then I think I don't, so a lot of times I just think I have a crush on you, but then I see myself thinking of you and how I could fit you in my life, and I know it's something else. I don't pull these efforts for anyone else. we really became friends then. Before that we were just two people who flirted with each other and had similar ideas, but afterwards we were connected.

Sometimes I wonder if you are just clever enough to keep me at arms length. I do think you have your suspicions about me and my feelings

At some point we started to drift, to the point I didn't notice when I stopped being so into you. We grew busy and what used to be a frequent interaction started to dwindle. I let myself step aside and I started to participate in new things, and these things would slowly pull me away from you because of time. 

I have to confess that I thought you didn't care for me too much. I used to think you noticed me when I was around but not when I wasn't. I know I entertain you and that with me around you would not ignore me. I wouldn't think too much about this

And with that, I never thought my being gone would matter to you. You would just see me as somebody that you used to know, even though we never met in person. Even though you knew me in ways most people don't. We were close but not so close that I would be hurting you by leaving. 

At first I was a little sad that you would not be a part of my life, only when the link fit the search, but it was in my browser history. You probably didn't get that, because you are not tech-y, but I like to think you get the gist.

In time, studies in your college and your degree, but I didn't need to dwell on the idea of you, as opposed to when we first met. At that time, I would imagine myself explaining the nuances of my life to you, as if I carried you around in my shoulder. How being two minutes late to the bus stop meant I would have to ride to school without sitting down. Other times I would relive our conversations or imagine how you would comment before a particular circumstance, I would carry you with me everywhere, in time I forgot.

I've never told you this, not sure when exactly but I am sure it was before meeting you, I met a girl. She was a season fling. I was on vacation and she was a good diversion to my obsessive mind, so I developed a crush. When I returned home, I wrote this:

*I know it will be hard for me*
*And it will take a while*
*But someday you'll be a memory*
*And won't hurt me anymore*

Dramatic overtones aside, but I was sure I would grow inert to the memory of her, so I was sure that someday you'd be a memory that wouldn't hurt me anymore –and yes, I know it's lame to quote my own song, but I think a lot  in song lyrics.

So when I saw myself slowly forgetting you, because there was no secret anymore.

I didn't allow myself to indulge in finding out how you were doing. I was sticking to the plan of forgetting you and it was working. I was moving on. But six or seven months passed, and seeing myself in that circumstance made me reminisce. Maybe somewhere in my mind I thought that if I could achieve that life someday, we would have more in common; enough to make our 1% grow a bit.

Then I returned home and I forsaked those thoughts. I was focused on my duties again and I didn't have time to spend on the random thoughts that kept coming up. 

But then one night, but I was there, and I saw you. It didn't take long for me to say hi. After all, I had no feelings for you anymore, other than the kind of love old friends have for each other. It was nice to say hi and I don't regret it. Not one hour had passed and we were back where we were, like we never missed a day. 

And here I am, I didn't stay out of love with you for long. Everything that was there clicked together and before I knew it, I was carrying you in my pocket again.

The truth is that you give me a sense of happiness that I just don't get anywhere else. It doesn't make me whole, either our friendship would find itself destroyed or we could finally have the most honest relationship ever and we would be happy having each other in our lives but without turning any unnecessary stones.

Having said that, and that you make my life better. Better is not easy or simple, but I already know what it is to live in a world with you in it but without you around me. 

I don't want to believe you don't know who I am, because I fear the answer will be no. 

It's possible I am fooling myself, and maybe I don't love you all that I say I do, but I know I miss you. 

I am getting the sense that we are reaching a conclusion and I won't like it

You've always been the brave one and you are moving us forward, and I want you to never let me go. But maybe that is what we need.

You will probably never read this –and the fact I posted on a throwaway account makes that even harder– and that is ok. But if I could tell you one thing, it would be this:

You have been loved. You may have noticed or not, even though you never planned or asked for it. When you feel down, and you think that you and your life is worth little, when you think you're too flawed to be loved or whenever you feel alone and misunderstood, I want you to **know** that just the fact that you exist makes my world better, and that makes you exceptional. I don't know if there will be someone that will love you more than I do but, if it's for your benefit

I knew from the minute I saw you that you would grow to be irrevocably important to me.  I walked through those shitty steel doors, years ahead of me.  

Your smile, deep down in my soulless frame, I knew I would.

I don't remember if it was in wiping your tears, I became uncontrollably magnetized.  It was intoxicating.  

When you finally had enough of the lies, I was there for you still.  You were broken.  Your innocence stolen, from you.  The innocence I wanted so very badly to protect.  But I couldn't do it.  I was only a little too late.  But I would give anything to turn back the clock and be there before him.  I wouldn't - couldn't, have hurt you like he did.  

The best I could do now

I shared with you my life, your touch an indelible high.  When we finally made love for the first time, I swear I could feel my very self slip away in your euphoria.   

Even in our less than perfect moments, only to come back to one another, longing for reconciliation and acceptance once more.

But this time simply cannot be.

The first time I saw you, it came to an end.  An ending that was chosen by you, and not by us.  

Somehow, you compromised the dream.  You shared your love with another, leaving me trapped in your vice.  Trapped with nothing but fading memories, and a shattered heart.  Trapped alone in my head, with no one to rescue me.  No one to put me back together, as I'd done selflessly and lovingly for you.  No one to fix me, and restore what little humanity I have left.  

So here I sit, and still have, hoping that somehow, someday, you'll find them.  And maybe then, you'll feel like I feel.  

But somehow, and found solace in another.  And now, I am truly shattered.

I sometimes wonder if you remember it all the way I do. If you remember how you bullied me relentlessly all through elementary school. How you stomped on my feet and crushed my hands and pulled my hair. How you always lied to the teachers and claimed I was the one who'd done those things to you, and I was an easy target. You gossiped about me behind my back and mocked me to my face. You were an expert manipulator. In front of my parents or my brother, you'd act totally sweet so that, for the longest time, no one would believe me when I told them how cruel you really were. That was probably the worst hurt you did me - making me feel so alone and abandoned. Remember 6th grade, when you pushed me too far and I finally snapped, screaming ""I hate you! I hate you!"" in front of everyone, teachers? I hope you felt at least a little shame
I don't know why you hated me so much but maybe it was because I had things you didn't have - a happy family, a little lost in my own head - but I think it says something about you that you were so threatened by my strangeness that you just had to make an issue of it. Deep down you probably hated yourself, maybe even more than I came to hate you.
I hope you're a better person now than you were then. Some might call it unfair to judge a person on their behavior under the age of 12, but now you have none. There's a part of me that still feels so much rage towards you, a vindictive side that fantasizes about shaming you publicly or seeing you miserable and defeated. But ultimately I owe it to myself to move on. You brought so much pain and anger into my life, and I think the only way I can win this fight you started so long ago is by forgiving you. I forgive you for hurting me, even though you've never apologized. It's been more than ten years. You were just a kid, even though you seemed like some kind of all-powerful witch at the time. You were scared; you were selfish; you wanted to feel in control. I forgive you; or I am trying to forgive you. I am far stronger and far freer than I was, and you have no more ways to hurt me.

I spent over an hour sitting in a corner by myself

You were in the first tour group that walked by.

I recognized you

We’ve shared meals

But you and I have never had a conversation just to the two of us.

It was always just me fringing on whatever nerdy things you guys were saying around the fries stuffed in your mouths.

But today…today you sat with me. 

You talked with me. You laughed with me.

You helped me figure out where to go

You stood with me in line to get our ID photos taken

You weren’t afraid to dance slightly to the song on the radio that I was too afraid to even admit I liked.

You let me talk at you about things that had been bugging me, while remaining (seemingly) interested.

You let me show you the textbooks I had gotten from the bookstore that I had previously avoided due to the sheer volume of people flowing in and out of the doors. 

You waited patiently for my conversations with various other friends to me, a new or old topic of discussion ready to be broached. 

I was really dreading this day

We left together, I picked you up to prove my earlier point that it automatically ends in a smile, which is what I wanted to give you.

You told me to have fun driving, as I’m awkward.

You drove out first

I’ve never been more simultaneously relieved and saddened at one occurrence. 

I don’t (think I) suddenly have a crush on you just because you saved my day

1345087152.0,yatx5,"To my best, and worst, friend",myrrlyn,14,2

I don’t really know where to begin here. I guess I’ll just start with the end. I decided I wanted some distance because I just couldn’t take it anymore. I couldn’t take how much I cared about you

And please don’t think that this is because you don’t matter to me

When we met, I was captivated by you. I was so surprised by you and I felt there was so much waiting to happen. I couldn’t just ignore you like I was everybody else. I didn’t know anything about you, not even your name, but when we would randomly meet in the halls I had to stop and talk to you, even if for a sentence at a time.

The next year, someone who could help me get out of my shell and give me hope. And you did. You gave me hope, Mal, for the first time in a LONG time. You gave me a reason to keep going, a reason to look forward to each new day because you’d be in it. And I fell in love with you.

I didn’t know what to do with that at first. There were some seriously awkward moments when I was terrified that I’d done the wrong thing. I came close to panicking and shutting you out. And in retrospect, but in light of recent discussions I think maybe I might have been better served without you.

Every new guy you had in your life hurt me. A lot. I was so horribly jealous of them because they’d get to know you in a way I felt I never would. And I felt slighted by that. I felt like I was a much better person than they were and I was much closer to you, since you’re still friends with your exes, and the last exchange we had was you basically telling me to fuck off. But I digress. So for each new boyfriend, after my initial spurt of jealousy for Nathan, I just smiled and buried it. Supported you, encouraged you, tried to spend time with you when I could.

I remember one time, and said I’d thought I could do a decent job in that role. And you looked at me, like I was a cross between a mental patient and an alien, and stammered a little before managing to say you had no idea I thought of you in that way. I probably wasn’t good at communicating that. I wasn’t good at communicating much of anything to you. But I thought you’d have figured this out by now. We were going on two years of friendship and I’d been so close to you for so long. You came to me for advice and comfort and solace and I thought, clearly mistakenly, the fact that I kept providing it showed my interest. So that really crushed my confidence for a while.

The next spring, you really did care about me and want me to be yours. I thought you got so worried I’d replace you with her because you wanted to matter that much to me. I remember telling Nikki that I thought it was hilarious that you were worried that she’d replace you when you were never more than a friend to me. I was just trying to allay her fears that you’d beckon and I’d leave her in the dust, and yet, if you had beckoned, if you had said you wanted a real relationship between us, I would have left her in a heartbeat. But that window slammed shut the next day. And then reopened the day after that, when I told her to go back to Kyle

And then we started talking about marriage. You have no idea how happy that made me. I didn’t care that you made it a conditional agreement to take effect in six years, you’d remove the condition. We’d date. Get engaged. Get married. Live a long and happy life together. That wish only got stronger when you kissed me. I was so in love with you, Mal, and I wasn’t really thinking about your position because it looked like you were starting to return the sentiment.

And then suddenly, but this summer, after that wonderful night of my return from college, we were never really together. We were alone in the same place. It took me a while to notice, and even longer to admit that I didn’t know why it happened or if I could reverse it, but I got the hint. Especially at your open house. I am still impressed by how you managed to avoid me for ten hours. Even when we did speak, it felt like you were reprimanding me for being isolated and alone when I thought you knew I hated people. The more people around me, and try as I might I could never find you. That was basically the end for me. I tried so hard to get us to spend time together after that. I wanted desperately for us to be us again, and the worst part is I honestly enjoyed that status because at least you played with me. At least I wasn’t lying discarded in the back of the closet. And I think it drove Nikki a little crazy. And we argued about it, and got wildly suspicious and angry about us being friends. I remember telling Nikki only a few days before that no

Well, I’m out. I don’t want us to drift away entirely; I still enjoy being friends with you and I still love you and I’m pretty sure I’ll always be willing to drop everything and come running to your side if you ask, but I can’t let myself do that. I can’t let you just walk all over me without even the decency to take off your heels. Okay, that metaphor sucked. I hope this will wake you up a little. I hope you’ll decide my friendship is important to you and I hope you’ll make the requisite changes in your character for me to come back. I really do. I desperately want to help you and to be your friend and to try and repay you for the life you gave me. But where we are right now? It’s killing me, Mal. It is. I’m throwing away happiness left and right over you. I stunted my relationship with Kat because I felt conflicted about you. I gave Nikki away because of you. I can’t even think about getting to know girls at my college because I still was in love with you. You gave me my life back, Mal, and I don’t think either of us would want me to let it wither because of you.

So I’m writing this to try and communicate, with all my heart. You’re so incredibly important to me and doing this cuts me to the core. I fight with myself every day over it and it takes all my control and some outside help to keep from running back to you, from flinging myself at your feet and apologizing and swearing never to leave you again. I feel so awful for abandoning you, for leaving when I swore I’d always be in your life. It’s some of the more excruciating pain I’ve ever felt, and you should know that means a lot, but I’m doing it because I believe I need to. Because I believe that maybe this course will help you, maybe help us, I think I should be selfish. I’ve given you so much, and its time I actually used them rather than clinging to your leg. You’ve been saying this for a while now

I love you Mali. I do. I’m scared of standing up on my own. Of venturing into the unknown without your hand to hold. And I will always, at least for now, goodbye.

And then you met her.

I thought Cary was a nice enough woman. She treated my brother and me fine (at first) and didn't try too hard to be a mother figure to us. When you got married, you could have a chance to have a wife again. I was so excited and genuinely happy for you. Most eight year olds would be bitter and resent their parent marrying someone else, but I was just so damn happy that I got to wear a pretty dress to the wedding. I could tell you were happy too, and that was all that mattered.

When Adam came along, but he'd already been my brother for seven years and Adam was just a precious baby. At the same time, I saw things were changing. You stopped taking me during the week. I was confused, but mom said that it was only temporary, I forgot about it. You had your thing to do and it wouldn't be so bad to wait a while for things to go back to normal. Well, they didn't.

Then Eva was born and you started taking me only once a month. The reason you gave me? Because you didn't want her to take away your kids like mom took us away from you. This reason is horse shit. My mom always took us to your house and made sure to paint you in a good light. She supported us seeing you, I didn't want to lessen that time. But I should have said something. If I did, maybe things would have been different.

Fast forward a few years, our cousins intervened. Then you have the nerve, the absolute NERVE, to accuse us of not taking initiative to be a part of the family.

I define myself through the external, because there is beauty, there is an eternal light that resides within you. You are my sun, my eternal now. You show me who I am, by patiently watching you.

I am always watching you (even in the peripheral), I have grown to learn to not trust myself.

First off

I have been alone my whole life

Then one day, eventually I saw you for who you were, trying to make life easier and better for everyone around you. I started to trust you, you started to trust me. Our messages became more and more personal. We connected on a level I didn't know existed. I found myself again the fool, head over heels for someone who couldn’t be with me due to circumstances. Going out of my way for someone I thought I knew at the time was only using me. Then it happened. You sent me the one message I have never received from any woman, you told me how hard things are because you are in love with me. It was the most beautiful thing I have ever received from the most beautiful person I have ever met, inside and outside. Because of your beauty, happy. I never felt true love and happiness up until that point.

Everything in the world was amazing and new again. When I was reluctant to tell you these things for fear of making your life harder due to your circumstances. You would then tell me exactly what i was thinking and wanted to tell you. We were two perfect lego blocks that fit. I did start to struggle

Years passed, have to let me go because it was causing you too much trouble and hardships. I knew if I truly loved you, I had to cut you off. The hardest thing I have ever done. It became too hard to bear on a daily basis. The pain inside is ripping me apart. I have not cried since decade ago when I lost a much loved family member. For the first time in a long while I cried myself to sleep that night. Since then I have lost count the amount of times I cried from that point. The most perfect thing in my life, I had to throw away. I still cannot deal with it and try to avoid the subject in my head.

Some time passed, exorcize and friends. Nothing worked, even though I put a smile on my face and pretend I enjoy it, I don't. I feel torn up inside and can only think of you every second of every minute of every hour of every day. And that is killing me. I started smoking pot to see if I could find revelation in an alter state of consciousness, it helped at the start. But that did not last and I then later am more depressed when high, thinking only of you. I started to drink, then that became more and more. It only made things more horrible to bear when I was drunk

Life is still going on, did not end up with a 100% failure like I did. Now you are gone and all I have left is an empty void. You seem to also not have the constant smile on you that you had when we openly loved each other. I have to see you and sit next to you everyday and can’t speak to you. Main reason is because I cannot bring myself to cause you pain, because I love you. If in order to help you means I must live in hell for the rest of my life, then I will accept it, because I would do anything for you. Even though I feel deep down that all I want is to have you back in my life. We don’t have to be married, couple or relationship. Just having you there would mean everything to me.

Since you are gone, my everything.

warm regards

Maggie

I just miss you being into me. We used to sneak off and make out and things just because we both wanted to. *You used to be into me.* That thought won’t leave my head. You *used* to be into me. What happened?

I also think about why I’m so into you. I mean, become angry at you, and then inevitably thought of your face and felt all the anger melt away against my will. In the years that we dated, you claimed all of my heart and then, in a long and painful fashion, squeezed it to a shrivelled pulp.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

*Nothing Better - The Postal Service*

Remember that time I cried during this song when you picked me up from the train station? You cared about me then. That was recent. You hugged me really meaningfully. Thanks for that. Despite the tone of this letter

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


*Simeone’s Dilema - WHY?*

I’m treading on thin ice with this song too. Bad idea

I took for granted how amazing the feeling of being loved is. We used to spend so much time together. I loved every last moment of it. Even when we fought... my god, that’s why our time together sucks now. You don’t enjoy being around me, then I recognize that, and we both have an awful time.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


The first part of Friday night was so shitty. I’ve never felt worse. It all started with the fact that I wasn’t invited to the party. I don’t really care about that, you would have wanted me to go with you.

Then I went home and cried and wrote you a note. Not because of the whole party thing. Just because I was feeling particularly bad. And I just wanted you to read that fucking note. Then you called me, and you were angry at me. For what? Ruining your plans? There I was, on my bedroom floor, hiding from my parents, sobbing. And you were worried about your plans. You felt nothing. How did I become so insignificant to you so quickly?

*Talking Shit About a Pretty Sunset - Modest Mouse*

You somehow thought that I made you come over. How could you draw that conclusion from a conversation that ended with me saying “Don't come over if you don’t want to talk to me.” Also

Anyway, exclaim all my feelings for you, apologize, and *finally*, **finally** tell you that I think you really fucked up. But somehow, you were mad at me. At least at first. But then, I think something clicked. You seemed to feel guilty. Maybe you weren’t, anyway. Not for leaving me

After that, that you didn’t enjoy time with me--dissipated for a moment. Did you feel nothing for me that night? Nothing at all? If you truly have no feelings for me and if you truly think we’re incompatible, explain that situation that you instigated. (And while you’re at it, explain all the times we hooked up after I went to school.)

And you wonder why I can’t get over you. It’s because of shit like that, stop putting me in those situations, because they mean a lot to me.

As long as a women is a nice person who treats others as she wants to be treated, or if she's shy, or has a problem with society or whatever. And I never did, even when I wasn't anxious at all. Why do I have to be judged on confidence? Assertiveness? Spontaneity? I had those things but they are all gone. And now you don't give me a second glance. Neither does any girl after she finds out my problem. 


If there's anything you taught me, and we all have similar thoughts. But your kind isn't doing me a favor through my dark times. My depression is spiraling out of control, and it would be bad enough if the severe anxiety wasn't adding fuel to it. But now, I can't even go to many places to unwind, or drink my troubles away. Being in the darkest time of a person's life with no emotional support is something I wish not even my worse enemy goes through. The trouble is, I wanted ""love"" since I was in the fucking FIRST GRADE. It's pathetic. I don't know why I'm like this, but I am. If I surpass this
