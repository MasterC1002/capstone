FACEBOOK INFO: for the JULY 4th Protest https://www.facebook.com/events/507614159287698/

**Time and Date:** July 4th

**Place:** Lake Eola Park near the Walt Disney Amphitheater

Bring **WATER**, and make sure you have a way to get food. Parking will probably be somewhat difficult as streets around the park will be closed, plan accordingly.

Flyer: https://docs.google.com/file/d/0BzabW33pS9BleWpGUld6azFPRjQ/edit?usp=sharing


**As this slowly drifts down into the reddit void it may become more difficult for us to stay organized. Please if you are at all interested join the facebook event group


If you still have concerns or worries about this I need to know


I have lived here in Central Florida all my life and now that I am finishing my classes at Seminole State College I will be a UCF Knight in the Fall. I have always looked up to every single UCF student and I want to continue to do so. Many of you have probably read about the NSA and their current missteps intruding on our Fourth Amendment rights. As an American and Central Floridian I would hope that many of you are as outraged about this as I am. For too long I have sat back and watched as our rights have been forgotten in the struggle for ""Security."" There is a quickly growing subreddit /r/restorethefourth that is a meeting ground for many who feel the same as myself across the country. Yet I am more interested in you, and my classmates. Is this enough to get you out and stand together? If not, what will be? Anyone who wishes to discuss a peaceful protest made by and attended by UCF students may discuss it here or on the event page. Any ideas, thoughts, beliefs and worries are welcome. Go Knights.

If you think you can make it

**READ THIS:** IF you plan to attend you should read this post http://www.reddit.com/r/restorethefourth/comments/1g1cd4/why_it_should_be_july_4th_and_what_you_should/ and it should be known that you need to dress well, every American should be able to get on board.  Anyone who instigates or causes any violence will be immediately asked to leave, **if any sort of violence progresses I will have police called.** That is the way this protest must be to garner the respect that it needs. Anyone standing beside us must hold themselves to a high standard and must not be easy to instigate. The very thing we are protesting is the overreach of government power into our rights, I ask that you trust your fellow classmates but I also ask that you be careful. This is not just something fun to do because you are bored. I am here to make a difference and I demand that anyone who I stand beside is too.

**Thanks!** I mean this in the most sincere form,False,,t5_2qh7r,1372908497.0,,,t3_1g07x5

Hello, who typically, are first-generation college students, to not fully understand, and maybe not even appreciate the purpose of a university. Some students erroneously believe a university is just an extension of high school, where students are spoon-fed “soft” topics and dilemmas to confront, regurgitate the “right” answers on exams (right answers as deemed by the instructor or a textbook)

Not only is this not the purpose of a university (although it may feel like it is in some of your other courses), is to struggle intellectually with some of life's most difficult topics that may not have one right answer, and try to come to some conclusion about what may be “the better answer” (It typically is not the case that all views are equally valid; some views are more defensible than others). Another purpose of a university, and my course in particular, is to engage in open discussion in order to critically examine beliefs, behaviors, and customs. Finally, to start learning how to do so. We are not in class to learn “facts” and simply regurgitate the facts in a mindless way to items on a test. Critical thinking is a skill that develops over time. Independent thinking does not occur overnight. Critical thinkers are open to having their cherished beliefs challenged, versus views that are grounded in evidence

Last class meeting and for 15 minutes today

Religion and culture go “hand in hand.” For some cultures

Students in my class who openly proclaimed that Christianity is the most valid religion, I suppose I should thank you for demonstrating to the rest of the class what religious arrogance and bigotry looks like. It seems to have not even occurred to you (I'm directing this comment to those students who manifested such bigotry), as I tried to point out in class tonight, how such bigotry is perceived and experienced by the Muslims, the Hindus, the Buddhists, the non-believers, in class, are Christians).

The male student who stood up in class and directed the rest of the class to “not participate” by not responding to my challenge, is pretty arrogant and grossly disrespects the rights of other students who can and want to think for themselves and decide for themselves whether they want to engage in the exchange of ideas or not. Moreover, this “let's just put our fingers in our ears so we will not hear what we disagree with” is appallingly childish and exemplifies “anti-intellectualism.” The purpose of a university is to engage in dialogue, debate, and exchange ideas in order to try and come to some meaningful conclusion about an issue at hand. Not to shut ourselves off from ideas we find threatening.

Universities hold a special place in society where scholarly-minded folks can come together and discuss controversial, including UCF, have special policies in place to protect our (both professors’ and students’) freedom to express ourselves. Neither students nor professors have a right to censor speech that makes us uncomfortable. We're adults. We're at a university. There is no topic that is “off-limits” for us to address in class, if even only remotely related to the course topic. I hope you will digest this message, and just as important, will take it to heart as it may apply to you.

Charles Negy

The best on campus advertisement will get the poster if we win the best percentage growth award! All you have to do is advertise on campus, take a picture of it, and submit it to this subreddit with a comment with what you want as your flair. Examples/ideas of on campus advertisements include:

* Writing reddit.com/r/ucf on the corner of a class room white board
* Telling people to visit ucf.reddit.com w/ sidewalk chalk
* Hanging a reddit sign in your lab
* Advertising reddit on outside your dorm room's door.

Now the best part about this is I knew all the answers and she would give out candy for who ever could get the correct answer. As I found myself getting candy and just handing it out to other kids I seemed to of been on to something as the girls and bigger set boys moved in next to me and started to talk to me and wanted my name and was asking which freshmen dorms I would be staying in.

So as you may know, bathroom stalls at Islands of Adventure seem to only have electric hand dryers.

After realizing this, and when I went in to dry off, I happened to notice a ring on the floor. This sounds a bit like some kind of popular book and/or movie series doesn't it?

The ring itself was found in the men's bathroom just outside the entrance to the Hulk around 11pm. I don't really want to put up a picture of it or describe it because I feel like anyone can just say it's theirs

If you lost a high school class ring, I'll meet up with you on campus to return it, or even mail it to you if you're not from here.

The ring is pretty large

I never got one myself, let me know!

1. Be prepared before you walk in the door. Have your UCF ID (just in case the finger scanners are down) and a water bottle in hand. The gym also plays pretty terrible music so I would recommend an mp3 player and earbuds.

2. Dress in ""appropriate"" attire. You will get kicked out if you are wearing cargo shorts or flip flops. The typical gym outfit consists of a tshirt or tank top, but you will get a lot of weird looks if you decide to wear jeans, pants, a polo, etc.

3. Know what exercises you will be doing. Whatever you do

4. The gym gets PACKED between 4pm and 9pm. Avoid it at all costs during these times.

5. Once you're in

6. Finally, that's fine. Just do it with proper form. Any stares you might get while you're working out are probably us regulars thinking ""I hope he sticks with it"" or ""keep it up dude.""

There is **no reason** you should be bored at UCF. It's like being sprayed with a firehose

If you live on campus here is rule #1:
&gt;The only reason you should be in your dorm room is to sleep or have sex.

**Everything else should be done out of your dorm and preferably with other people.**

Still want to play video games? You damn well better have 2+ other people in the room that you can talk shit to when you kill them on whatever video game you're playing.

Still don't know what to do? [Here](http://rso.asf.ucf.edu/Public/Pages/PublicEnd/GeneralPublicForm.aspx) is a list of about 500 organizations that want you as a member. Go talk to them

I want to make this absurdly fucking clear: **this is the only time in your life where people are paid a salary to make sure you aren't bored.** After college it will be infinitely harder to meet people that don't suck.

So don't sit here doing the old scroll-scroll-scroll on reddit. Get it blocked on your computer if you can. Take it a step further-- if there is any way to make sure you can't access the internet in your room during the day

   I decided to do this AMA after reading some of the discussion in [this post]( http://www.reddit.com/r/ucf/comments/rjmqg/how_i_feel_walking_on_campus_with_all_the_bikes/) about bike riders and longboarders running into people on campus. I also remember posts a while back talking about the bike auction. I thought people might be interested in knowing all about the bike situation on campus

*A little about myself:*

   I have been biking in Orlando for 4 years and have been working with Spokescouncil for the last 3 to grow the bike community in the East Orlando area and work with UCF and local government to make cycling in our area safer. Since moving here, for transportation, for fun, and have done a little bit of touring. I work on my own bikes and help friends with theirs but tend to let the more qualified mechanics in Spokescouncil do the tricky stuff at shop hours. 

   I am very knowledgeable about bike laws in Florida and safe riding techniques. I will soon be trained as a Cycling Savvy instructor, and trail improvements for cyclists and pedestrians in Orange, Seminole, and Osceola counties. I also have frequent discussions with campus administrators about bike racks, bike abandonment, and safety.

*About Spokescouncil:*

   The main goal of Spokescouncil is to get more people riding bicycles. There’s so many reasons to ride a bike and we don’t care why you ride or what you ride as long as you do. Our efforts to get more people riding include holding fun bike rides

So that’s it! Anything you want to know about the club, ask away.

Bikes Bikes Bikes!

I fixed up the quad from a couple weekends ago and didn't test it at home... so of course it was vibrating and crap when I got to campus. Ended up side swiping a tree. No damage except a couple broken props. Except I'm out of props and Graves is closed on Sunday. FUCK. So I drive home and find some old ones to put on so I can at least take care of the vibes. Reluctantly put hot glue everywhere(I prefer epoxy because it doesn't melt in the sun...) to try and dampen the vibes. Everything was working great

Headed back to campus and flew milican hall twice. Then I realized the SD card must have popped out of the camera when it hit the driveway. So it recorded about 10 seconds to the internal 64MB flash until it got full. FUCK. No vibration-free milican footage :(. Next we walked to HEC and flew a battery there. Then Memory Mall.

The noise floor here is ridiculous. Something is spewing at or around 1280MHz. My video had interference at only 200-300 meters so I really had to maintain line of sight to keep signal. I wanted to fly from the fountain all the way down to the libra dorms around MAP and stuff but the video just wasn't solid enough for me to feel safe buzzing over people on the sidewalks. I had to stay really close to the ground station.

Also

**tl'dr**: fountain footage has jello/vibrations but then I fixed the problem for the next locations. Too much RF noise around here to do any ""serious"" flying like in my other vids. Maybe I'll try in a couple weeks with the ground station on top of garage I and D. Enjoy the shitty royalty-free dubstep I found :P

There is a new independent coffee shop open in the Waterford Lakes shopping center. I just checked the UCF thread, the place is very well done. It is apparent the owner took the endeavor seriously and invested a good sum of money into the business. Cost of espresso equipment alone is probably over 10-15 K. Interior is clean, modern, and very calming. Staff are well trained, informative, and very friendly as well. I don't work there or own it, I'm just a grad student who wants to see this local business succeed and thrive in the area.

Anyway, and turned just as I did, so we both screeched to a stop in the middle of the intersection about 5 feet from one another. I backed up into my lane (no other car behind me), but she stayed in the middle of the intersection for about 10 seconds, covering her face and tearing up.

As well as about 30 hamburger patties (over-purchase for a cookout).


However, and they've been kept on ice for the past 36 hours, so I'm not comfortable throwing them in the freezer and using them long-term for the next 2 or 3 years or however long that'd take me to eat.


So I figured I'd throw a sausage fest at my place!


What I do have:


* Hotdogs

* Hamburgers

* Chips

* Brownie Tray

* Gas for the grill



What I might not have enough of:

* Hamburger buns (I have 8)

* Cheese (I have say 15 slices)

* Ketchup (I have one bottle)

* Mustard (I have half a bottle)

* Hotdog buns (I've got almost 40

* Soda / Beer (I have a 20 or 30 cans of Miller Lite

* Disposable plates (I've got my regular plates and that's it)

* Ice



What I want out of you:

* Have a good time

* Help me not waste these hot dogs

* Help on the grill if you know what you're doing

* Don't be a douche and crap up my place or cause drama

* Bring stuff on the ""might not have"" list if you think you'll want some




My apartment is on the smaller side (my living room gets rather crowded after 8 or 9 people), and keep it in your car, just in case.



**Time**: The time is subject to adjustment by an hour or two



**Location**: 3770 Khayyam Ave (Behind the Sterling apartments on Alafaya)



**Directions**: If you're heading North on Alafaya



**Parking**: I'm on the West side of Khayyam (side away from UCF), etc). My neighbors won't be happy if they can't find parking. 





Also: If there are left-over hotdogs and you want to bring some home / you want to swing by and grab a few for your own purposes


**UPDATE** (6:45AM): Seems I have 3 or 4 of my buddies showing up from my Facebook post, but one more bottle would probably be good. I had a few buddies over last night though, and of course we had hotdogs... did not even make a dent in the box **but I'm now down to 25 or so hotdog buns, and completely out of Pepsi**. Now, back to getting ready, see everyone later today!


**UPDATE 2**(3:00PM): So, it's still 3 or 4 plus whoever from here. I've got two people bringing hamburger buns and hotdog buns, but we still might be a little short on hotdog buns (right now we have enough buns for 2-3 hotdogs per person, whereas I have like 5-8 hotdogs per person). Publix isn't too far away so I'm not stressing it. A few people have asked about running the event past 10PM... and while I'm not going to say ""no"" at this point, it's not too likely. We'll have to see how the event goes, but, I normally go to bed like 11:30PM (screw early work schedules),,1340478672.0,t3_vgd0a

This made me do a double take and I checked my bank statement and saw no $5 monthly charge. I continued to read elsewhere and found that SunTrust implemented this last summer for regular checking accounts. Most of us have ""student checking"" which is free of the charge as of right now BUT suntrust plans on rolling it out on ALL checking accounts by the next year (that'll be the upcoming summer).

This time please try to actually do it, the software can literally be installed in minutes and it has the potential to help many people.

So a while back I mentioned that I wanted to start a boxing club

The first problem is members. I need at least 15 to start the club! So if you guys want to join and be a part of the first boxing club of UCF I'll need you to pm me for further instructions!

The second problem is the leadership. I currently have myself as president and someone else as a risk manager (in my old post I called her my vice president, and treasurer). In your pm to me for further instructions on joining the club, let me know if you are interested in this as well. However, you must be SERIOUSLY INVOLVED if I pick you because, after all, we're starting a club here. A lot of work is needed.

The third and probably worst problem I have is the location. I was told I can't have it on campus (due to funding, or have a better suggestion, please comment below.

So all three of these things need to be resolved before the club can be approved. Now

(Coming to UCF with my AA) I am majoring in Public Administration! But...here's the kicker: I don't know anyone from UCF. :-o

I have many interests

I love basketball. (Specifically our joke of a team

I play it...but I'm not very good. 5'5"" and can't dribble. Mainly spot up and shoot (mostly miss) threes...and tend to spend the game mindlessly cutting the lane and watching no one pass me the ball regardless of me being open. lol

I love board games, Ticket to Ride. 

I love government

I'm interested in helping in the community through volunteer work. This doesn't have any specific area really...I just want to get involved in the Orlando/UCF community and donate my free time.

I know in a student population nearing, or you know a UCF club that fits my interests let me know. :) ",,False,,t5_2qh7r,False,,

an environmental issue and we are in the process of shutting down all of

preventative measure.

We do not have an estimate on when the building issues will be resolved to

**Swing dance!** It's cheap
- Friday nights   
- Beginner lesson 8pm - 9pm  
- Dance 9pm - 12am  
- $6 (includes the lesson)  
- If you become a member
- It's in the Multipurpose Room (left of the gym) in the Education Complex (near garages A and I)

Bottom line: it's something fun to do on a Friday night. Girls, that's what the lesson is for!  The lesson is fun and simple and gives you a chance to meet some people as you rotate through partners.  

There's also Beginner's lesson on Wednesday nights at 8:30 for $1 (free for members) but this is progressive with each semester

Well, I'll dance with you! If you're a guy... um... we'll see :p

1371836736.0,1gt1xe,Looking for a roommate to move in before August in apartment/house. Rent is roughly $350 a month per person.,S_Lance,14,5,5,"So! My name is Colton Younger. My roommate and I are looking for another roommate to live with us in our apartment for the next year. Our situation is a bit strange, but we wised up after that. Washer and dryer are included as well as a dishwasher. The room is 12x12 with a 5x2 closet. You'll have to share a bathroom with moi

HOWEVER. We are looking to move. This place has had a bug problem since we moved here ~2 years ago, so we very well might move there. If not, we still have this place and you're welcome to live with us here. But man that house looks cool. The tenant of that house is in England because they got transferred by their company. They aren't renting through a realtor so the rent is pretty damn cheap at $900 for a house. They'll be gone for 4-7 and mainly looking for people to keep the place clean and maintained until they get back. Which, hey, sounds like a sweet deal for college people. I plan on staying there until they get back, however, my roommate (Ryan by the way) is leaving sometime early next year. That means you and I could have to find another roommate if we so desired.

Either way, I guess? I'unno. Best way to get to know us is to talk to us.

Pretty long for an ad for a roommate, feel free to send me a message and I can clear up any questions or show you some pictures of the house we're looking at (it's real nice) or the apartment. Peace!

tl;dr Two guys wanting a roommate with rent around $350 no matter what happens. Message me if you're interested.

Edit: Oh, he's kinda tall. Ryan works as a teacher at UCF (probably) whereas I myself am not employed. However, I get more than enough money from financial aid to pay for housing and classes. I've lived in this specific apartment for two years and Ryan's lived here for about a year-and-a-half, so there shouldn't be very much worry about making sure rent is paid. Oh, speaking of information, the tenant from the house we're trying to get wants a little info about all of us like current address and rent, previous address and rent, etc. So just keep that in mind if you're interested.
